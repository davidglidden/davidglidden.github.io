  # Vespers for the Living: A Reverie in Cremona

  <p class="poetic"><em>Where the shape of a city stirs the shape of a
  soul</em></p>

  <div class="ornament musical"></div>

  ## I. Threshold

  The threshold between worlds is never a line but a breathing space—that moment
  when the foot hesitates before crossing, when the familiar dissolves and
  something unnamed begins to coalesce. In Cremona, this threshold breathes with
  particular intensity. Here, where Amati, Guarneri, and Stradivari once bent over
   their workbenches, the very air seems to hold the memory of wood surrendering
  to its perfect form.

  To arrive here as a string player is to enter a conversation that began
  centuries before your birth. The stones remember the sound of planes shaving
  spruce, the patient turning of pegs, the first tentative bow drawn across newly
  strung gut. This is a city that perfected something—not merely an instrument,
  but a way of listening to what wood wants to become.

  I had not walked these streets since <span class="oldstyle">2012</span>.
  Returning felt like placing a hand upon a pulse that had never stopped beating,
  though the rhythm had deepened, grown more complex. The surface of
  everything—cobblestones worn smooth by countless processions, facades that have
  weathered five centuries of weather and war—hums with accumulated presence.
  Nothing here is merely old; everything is seasoned, like the wood of those
  legendary violins, aged into resonance.

  Last night, in the Chiesa di San Marcellino, we performed Monteverdi's *Vespro
  della Beata Vergine* under Jordi Savall's direction. What follows is not a
  review of that performance but something more intimate: a meditation on what
  happened in that space between preparation and release, between the written note
   and its flowering in air, between the musician's intention and the music's own
  mysterious life.

  This is a reverie—not in the sense of idle dreaming, but in the older meaning: a
   returning, a coming back to something that was always there, waiting.

  ## II. The Maker of Bridges

  Claudio Monteverdi arrived in this world in <span class="oldstyle">1567</span>,
  when the Renaissance was already beginning to question its own certainties. Born
   in Cremona, he grew up breathing the same air that would later nurture the
  great violin makers, learning his craft from Marc'Antonio Ingegneri in the very
  cathedral where the stones still echo with their voices. But Monteverdi was not
  content to inherit a tradition; he needed to transform it.

  By the time he composed the *Vespro della Beata Vergine* in <span
  class="oldstyle">1610</span>, he had already begun to reimagine what sacred
  music could be. This was not liturgical music in the traditional sense—it was
  devotional, yes, but also declarative. A manifesto written in harmonies, a
  theological argument made audible. He submitted these Vespers not as liturgical
  necessity but as artistic proposal, perhaps to win favor in Venice, to move
  beyond the constraints of the Mantuan court.

  Monteverdi understood that he stood at a hinge moment in musical history. The
  Renaissance had taught him to think vertically—voices rising toward heaven in
  perfect mathematical proportions. But the emerging Baroque demanded horizontal
  movement, drama, the recognition that music could be not just cosmic but
  personal, not just eternal but urgently present.

  The *Vespers* embodies this tension. Ancient psalm tones serve as cantus firmi,
  anchoring flights of the most adventurous polyphony. Motets drawn from the Song
  of Songs shimmer with a sensuality that has been transfigured, not denied. This
  is music that knows it stands between worlds, and instead of choosing sides, it
  builds bridges.

  To perform this music is to become part of that bridge-building. Each time we
  lift our instruments, each time we shape a phrase, we participate in
  Monteverdi's ongoing conversation between what was and what wants to be.

  ## III. Architecture of Evening

  The Catholic Vespers service marks the hinge of day—that moment when light
  begins its retreat and lamps are lit against the gathering darkness. It is the
  hour of *lucernarium*, the lighting of the evening lamp, when the community
  gathers to sing the day toward its rest. Monteverdi's *Vespers* for the Blessed
  Virgin follows this ancient structure: five psalms, the hymn *Ave maris stella*,
   and the climactic *Magnificat*, all woven together with motets and instrumental
   sinfonias that breathe like spaces between prayers.

  But this is no mere setting of liturgical text. This is architecture made
  audible, space built from time and silence and the trembling of air. Each
  movement unfolds with the logic of a Renaissance church: grand and intimate
  simultaneously, ornate yet purposeful, every detail serving the whole while
  claiming its own particular beauty.

  The psalm settings anchor everything. These ancient melodies, worn smooth by
  centuries of monastic voices, become the foundation upon which Monteverdi builds
   his extraordinary superstructure. In *Dixit Dominus*, the opening psalm, the
  familiar chant emerges from a blaze of instrumental fanfares like a cathedral
  appearing through morning mist. The old and the new do not compete; they
  converse.

  The motets between the psalms function like the side chapels in a great
  church—intimate spaces where the soul can pause, gather itself, encounter the
  divine in more personal terms. *Nigra sum* draws its text from the Song of
  Songs: "I am black but beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem." Here, the
  theological becomes erotic, the sacred and the sensual revealed as always having
   been one conversation, spoken in different dialects.

  And through it all, the figure of Mary—not as distant queen but as present
  intercessor, the one who magnifies not herself but grace, who says yes to what
  she cannot understand and in that yes makes space for mystery to take flesh.

  ## IV. The Stone Remembers

  Her tomb lies flush with the floor, its Latin inscription worn soft by centuries
   of feet passing over. <span class="small-caps">Lucia Perotti</span> <span
  class="oldstyle">1568–1641</span>. The dates frame a life that ran almost
  exactly parallel to Monteverdi's own, though their paths likely never crossed in
   any way that history remembers. Yet here, in the Chiesa di San Marcellino,
  their legacies interweave like voices in a motet.

  ![Tomb of Lucia Perotti in San Marcellino](/assets/img/lucia-perotti-tomb.jpg){:
  .image-small}
  *The worn inscription of Lucia Perotti's tomb, where centuries of footsteps have
   softened the Latin words into meditation*

  Lucia was born into nobility but chose a different kind of authority. Widowed
  young, childless, she might have retreated into private grief. Instead, she
  claimed her sorrow and transformed it into foundation. The story goes that on
  November <span class="oldstyle">21</span>, <span class="oldstyle">1609</span>,
  the Virgin appeared to her robed in white light, saying: <span
  class="small-caps">"Procede et noli timere"</span>—"Go ahead and fear not."
  Within months, the Collegio della Beata Vergine was born, an institution
  dedicated to educating girls regardless of their station.

  That year: <span class="oldstyle">1610</span>. The same year Monteverdi was
  completing his *Vespers*.

  Lucia's revolution was quiet but radical. In an age when women's learning was
  often seen as dangerous, she insisted that education was not privilege but
  necessity, not luxury but basic human dignity. Her motto, preserved in the
  archives of her institution: <span class="small-caps">"Magistra debet esse mater
   amans… corrigat cum dulcedine"</span>—"The teacher should be a loving mother…
  correct with gentleness."

  Her pedagogy echoes something I recognize from our work with Jordi Savall. Once,
   early in our collaboration, I confessed my doubts about assuming a leadership
  role in the ensemble. I told him that real authority, I believed, must arise
  from mutual respect, not imposition. His response affirmed that principle so
  completely it became foundational for me—not only in how I approach music, but
  in how I understand presence itself.

  Both Lucia and Monteverdi built spaces where transformation could occur—through
  beauty, through discipline, through the kind of shared attention that allows
  individual voices to serve something larger than themselves. Her college, his
  *Vespers*: different forms of the same impulse, the same trust that human beings
   are capable of more than they know.

  Walking over her tomb each time I enter San Marcellino, I feel the weight of
  that trust. Her sleep is not passive but generative, like the silence between
  notes that makes music possible.

  ## V. The Listening Flame

  In our ensemble, we are twelve voices, two violins, viola, violone, cello, viola
   da gamba, lirone, bass, harp, theorbo, organ, recorders, cornetti, and
  trombones. These are the forces Monteverdi dreamed for, the exact
  instrumentation his imagination required. To perform this music with anything
  less—or more—is to miss its particular breathing, its specific gravity.

  But the deeper ensemble is harder to describe. It includes the space itself, the
   accumulated silence of centuries, the particular way light falls through the
  windows of San Marcellino at evening, the presence of all those who have sung
  these words before us. We are part of something larger than our individual
  contributions, something that was already happening before we arrived and will
  continue after we leave.

  Under Jordi's direction, something remarkable occurs in the moments when I am
  not playing. *Tacet*—from the Latin *tacere*, to be silent—does not mean
  absence. It becomes a different kind of presence, a listening so complete it
  becomes a form of participation. When my bow is not drawing across strings, I am
   still making music—with my attention, my breathing, my willingness to receive
  what my colleagues are offering.

  These moments of musical silence are among the most profound of my performing
  life. I am no longer the one creating sound but the one through whom sound
  passes. I realize that I am not merely physical but spirit, not merely
  individual but part of an organism that thinks and breathes and remembers
  together. I marvel at the craftsmanship of my colleagues, astonished that I am
  not only contributing to the unfolding beauty but privileged to witness it from
  within.

  This is closer to prayer than performance. Each phrase becomes an offering, each
   silence a form of trust. We dwell within the music not as its masters but as
  its guests, grateful to be invited into its ongoing conversation with eternity.

  The space itself shapes this dwelling. San Marcellino's unfinished
  facade—austere, classical, flanked by Corinthian pilasters and vacant
  niches—conceals a baroque interior that blazes with gold and devotion. A single
  nave stretches beneath a barrel vault supported by massive timber trusses. There
   are no aisles to fragment the sound's journey; it travels uninterrupted,
  blooming in the open air like visible incense.

  Here, our voices do not simply echo—they return transformed, deepened, like
  prayers that have passed through time and brought back news of eternity. The
  acoustics are not merely favorable; they are revelatory, turning every sung
  phrase into a conversation between earth and heaven, between intention and
  grace.

  <div class="ornament musical"></div>

  ## VI. Voices That Lean Toward Light

  The *Vespers* unfolds like a map of divine encounter, each movement a different
  terrain of approach to mystery. In *Duo Seraphim*, two voices become three at
  the line <span class="small-caps">"Tres sunt"</span>—the Trinity manifesting not
   as doctrine but as living counterpoint. In *Audi coelum*, the echo responds
  from the choir loft like heaven replying to earth, and we hear both the call and
   its answer, the question and its eternal yes.

  This is music that understands intercession not as distant petition but as
  intimate conversation. Mary, the constant presence threading through every
  movement, is not the remote queen of traditional devotion but the one who stands
   close enough to hear whispers, who magnifies not her own glory but grace
  itself.

  Lucia Perotti's vision joins the score here. Her educational mission was never
  cloistered withdrawal but radiant engagement. She welcomed the poor, housed the
  orphaned, taught any girl who came seeking knowledge. Her revolution was
  acoustic in the deepest sense: she understood that learning was meant to
  resonate beyond the walls that housed it, to change not just individuals but the
   larger song of the world.

  In the *Magnificat* that concludes the *Vespers*, Mary's song becomes our song:
  <span class="small-caps">"Magnificat anima mea Dominum"</span>—"My soul
  magnifies the Lord." But magnification here is not amplification; it is
  clarification, the way a lens brings distant light into focus. Mary's yes to
  mystery makes space for the impossible to become flesh, for the eternal to find
  a voice in time.

  Singing these words, I understand that we are all magnificat—we are all called
  to this same clarification, this same willingness to let something larger than
  ourselves find voice through our particular instruments, our specific offerings.

  <div class="ornament philosophical"></div>

  ## VII. Star, Gate, and Breath

  Throughout the *Vespers*, Mary appears under many names: *Ave maris stella*
  (Hail, star of the sea), *Alma Redemptoris Mater* (Loving Mother of the
  Redeemer), *Regina coeli* (Queen of heaven). But these are not different roles
  but different angles of vision on the same mystery—the human yes that makes
  space for divine possibility.

  As star, she is navigation, the fixed point by which travelers orient themselves
   when all other landmarks have disappeared. As gate, she is passage, the opening
   through which heaven and earth exchange their gifts. As breath, she is the
  space between words where meaning gathers itself for speech.

  Monteverdi's genius lies in making these theological concepts audible. The music
   does not describe Mary's intercession; it enacts it. When the voices weave
  together in *Duo Seraphim*, when the echo answers the call in *Audi coelum*,
  when the instrumental sinfonias dance between the movements like light playing
  on water, we are not hearing about divine love—we are participating in it.

  The great Marian feast days structure the work: Annunciation, Visitation,
  Assumption, Coronation. But these are not celebrations of distant events. They
  are recognitions of what is always happening, always possible, always being born
   in the space between yes and fulfillment.

  <div class="ornament musical"></div>

  ## VIII. What Remains in the Air

  The music ends, but it does not stop. In the silence that follows the final
  <span class="small-caps">Amen</span>, something continues to vibrate—not sound
  exactly, but the memory of sound, the shape that the music has carved in the air
   and in our listening. We sit in that resonance, reluctant to move, knowing that
   to speak or shift would be to let something precious drain away.

  This is where the performance becomes more than performance, where it reveals
  itself as a form of dwelling. We have not simply played Monteverdi's *Vespers*;
  we have inhabited them, made them temporarily our home. And now, in the
  lingering quiet, we understand that the music was also inhabiting us, making us
  its temporary home.

  Above us, the vaulted ceiling holds the last vibrations like cupped hands
  holding water. Below us, Lucia Perotti sleeps in her tomb, waiting, the
  inscription says, for the promised reward of resurrection. But perhaps it has
  already come—not as future promise but as present reality, in the continuation
  of her work through the centuries, in the echo of her choices in our choices, in
   this very moment when Monteverdi's lines lift once again in the space where she
   now rests.

  <p class="callout">John Berger once wrote that he lived for half a century
  clothed only in poems, until a wordless encounter taught him how many years of
  learning by heart had been a preparation for that moment.</p>

  To perform this *Vespers* is to know that feeling: that all your years of
  practice, of listening, of doubt and faith and the patient acquisition of skill,
   were preparing you for this breath, this measure, this unfolding.

  Music becomes our most faithful garment—not a costume we put on but a skin we
  grow into. And in the wearing of it, in the dwelling within it, the past ceases
  to be elsewhere. It becomes the light on a name worn smooth by time. The soft
  reverberation after a sung <span class="small-caps">"Sancta Maria"</span>. The
  lift of a hand before the next downbeat.

  We become the bridge they never crossed, the conversation they never finished,
  the echo of their echo in the endless round of voices that lean toward light.

  In this way, the *Vespers* never truly end. They continue in the space between
  breaths, in the silence between notes, in the listening that remains after the
  last sound has faded. They continue in us, through us, as us—until the next time
   we gather, lift our instruments, and give them voice again.

  <p class="poetic">The lamp is lit. The day turns toward evening. The ancient
  song begins again, as it always does, as it always will, in the space where
  memory and possibility meet in the eternal now of music making itself heard.</p>
