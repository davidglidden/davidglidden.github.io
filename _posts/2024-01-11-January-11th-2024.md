After days of overcast skies the sun has come.

Two rapaces are calling to each other across the fields. 

Some chickadees also chirping in their search for some seed to eat.

Sounds of melting snow and the odd goose from the bottom of the village, otherwise  silence.

The sun warms my body as I stand outside on the *terrace* facing south east.

An airplane passes overhead, high in altitude, but the surrounding silence remains largely undisturbed.
