A young couple about to kiss in front of me. 25-30 years old. Young man and young woman. Same age? *Probable*.

Faces so close to each other's, if not yet touching in the lightest of ways, then tantalizingly close.

Soft sweet words exchanged, barely audible even for them, but language is unnecessarily: *their shared searching gaze communicating what words cannot.*

The tension builds, the decisive moment imminent.

She leans intentionally into him and their lips meet, their eyes close and in an instant they are both of and separate from the world.
