### TYPOGRAPHY

The `$base-font-size` is currently set at `20px` with the `$base-line-height` of `1.3`, or `26px`. `400` and `700` font weights are used for regular or bold text respectively.

All fonts are self-hosted for privacy and performance.

The `body` text is set in [EB Garamond](https://github.com/octaviopardo/EBGaramond12/tree/master/fonts/):
> EB Garamond is a free and open source implementation of Claude Garamont's Antiqua typeface Garamond and the matching Italic, Greek and Cyrillic characters designed by Robert Granjon. Its name is an acronym for Egenolff-Berner-Garamond which refers to the fact that the letter forms are taken from the Egenolff-Berner specimen printed in 1592.

The `code` blocks are set in [`IBM Plex Mono`](https://www.ibm.com/plex/):
> When we set out to create a typeface that was unmistakably IBM, our own history was our greatest source of inspiration. IBM has always served as a medium between mankind and machine. Between the natural and the engineered. The emotional and rational. The classic and the cutting-edge. Our most important job is to help humanity and technology move forward together. IBM Plex® brings these relationships to life through letterforms.
