# Documentation System
## Animal Rationis Capax

This folder houses the complete documentation ecosystem for the Animal Rationis Capax project, designed to support long-term development and collaboration.

---

## Structure

### `/internal/` — Development Partnership
- **`collaboration-protocol.md`** — Core working relationship and communication patterns
- **`project-memory.md`** — Chronological development history and decision rationale
- **`TECHNICAL-REFERENCE.md`** — Detailed system architecture and implementation notes *(future)*
- **`DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md`** — Deep design philosophy and advisor consultations *(future)*

### Root Documentation
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Essential project instructions (main reference for Claude Code)
- **`style-guide.md`** — Complete semantic types and editorial guidelines
- **`typography-guide.md`** — Internal typography documentation
- **`DESIGN-DIALOGUES.md`** — Preserved advisor conversations

---

## Purpose

This documentation system serves multiple functions:

### **Persistence Simulation**
While Claude has no memory between sessions, detailed reference documents enable:
- Consistent understanding of project philosophy
- Preserved reasoning behind design decisions
- Continuity of communication patterns
- Accumulated knowledge about what works

### **Organic Evolution**
Documentation grows with the project:
- Protocols adapt as working patterns develop
- Memory accumulates significant decisions and rationale
- Reference materials expand as complexity increases
- Living documents that reflect current reality

### **Collaboration Enhancement**
Supports effective partnership by:
- Establishing clear communication expectations
- Preserving context between sessions
- Enabling quick reference to past decisions
- Facilitating handoffs and continuity

## Usage Guidelines

### For Claude Code
1. **Always read `CLAUDE.md`** at session start
2. **Reference collaboration protocol** for communication style
3. **Check project memory** for recent developments
4. **Update documentation** as work progresses
5. **Consult design advisors** for significant decisions

### For David
- Update memory after significant sessions
- Evolve protocols as working patterns change
- Add new reference materials as project grows
- Review documentation periodically for accuracy

### For Future Collaborators
This system provides complete context for:
- Understanding project philosophy and goals
- Learning established working patterns
- Accessing historical decision rationale
- Contributing effectively to ongoing development

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- **After major features**: Add to project memory
- **When patterns change**: Update collaboration protocol
- **Before new phases**: Review and refine documentation
- **Quarterly**: Assess system effectiveness

### Version Control
All documentation is version controlled alongside code, enabling:
- Tracking evolution of thinking
- Understanding decision context over time
- Reverting to previous approaches when needed
- Maintaining coherent development narrative
