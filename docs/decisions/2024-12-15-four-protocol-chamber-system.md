# ADR-001: Four-Protocol Chamber System Architecture

**Date**: 2024-12-15  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Supersedes**: N/A

## Context

The Chamber needed a systematic approach to AI-assisted editorial work that would ensure comprehensive perspective while maintaining ethical rigor. The goal was creating an editorial system that could:

- Generate multiple perspectives on submitted texts
- Ensure ethical reckoning alongside aesthetic evaluation
- Leverage different AI models' distinct capabilities
- Create accountability mechanisms for hidden violence in beautiful writing
- Produce both constructive transformation and necessary rejection

## Decision

Implement a four-protocol system using two AI models (GPT-4 and Claude) with two modes each:

**Standard Protocols**: Seek constructive transformation through dialogue
- GPT Standard: Compressed insights and conceptual frameworks
- Claude Standard: Elaborate world-building and embodied voices

**Shadow Protocols**: Question the work's right to exist
- GPT Shadow: Archetypal patterns of critique and refusal
- Claude Shadow: Specific historical grounding and detailed dark canon

Each text undergoes all four protocols, with results synthesized into deliberations that include both transformation attempts and complete rejection analysis.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Comprehensive perspective**: No text escapes without complete examination
- **Ethical accountability**: Shadow protocols prevent aesthetic complicity
- **AI model diversity**: Leverages distinct capabilities (Claude's elaboration vs GPT's compression)
- **Productive tension**: Standard/Shadow create necessary dialogue between beauty and ethics
- **Rich fictional output**: Multiple protocols generate diverse canonical works
- **Documented process**: Complete transparency of editorial reasoning

### Negative
- **Resource intensive**: Four AI sessions per text submission
- **Complex processing**: Requires systematic extraction and synthesis
- **Potential overwhelm**: Extensive output may obscure essential insights
- **Manual workflow**: Currently requires human orchestration of all protocols

### Neutral
- **Rejection as feature**: Shadow Protocol refusal becomes publishable outcome
- **AI perspective differences**: Becomes data rather than limitation
- **Fictional bibliography growth**: Ongoing commitment to expanding canon

## Alternatives Considered

### **Single AI Model Approach**
*Rejected*: Would lose perspective diversity and AI model-specific capabilities

### **Two-Protocol System (Standard + Shadow only)**
*Rejected*: Would lose AI perspective differences that create productive multiplicity

### **Human-only Editorial Council**
*Rejected*: Would lose AI models' ability to manifest diverse voices simultaneously

### **Automated Synthesis**
*Rejected*: Editorial synthesis requires human judgment for appropriate voice integration

### **Standard Protocol Only**
*Rejected*: Would enable aesthetic complicity by avoiding difficult ethical questions

## Implementation Details

- **Manual workflow**: David runs all four protocols, Claude Code processes results
- **Complete documentation**: All sessions archived with full protocol outputs
- **Synthesis methodology**: Human editorial judgment combines perspectives appropriately
- **Publication approach**: Both transformation and rejection outcomes published
- **Canon integration**: Fictional works automatically cross-referenced across sessions

## Future Considerations

- **Automation potential**: Could streamline protocol execution while preserving human synthesis
- **Protocol evolution**: Methods may develop based on session experience
- **Scale considerations**: Four-protocol approach limits submission volume
- **Quality vs. quantity**: Current approach prioritizes depth over breadth
