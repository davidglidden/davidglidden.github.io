## Final Jekyll Commit

This represents the culmination of The Chamber's foundational development:
- **Complete methodology** documented and protected
- **Living canon** system operational
- **Voice tracking** comprehensive
- **Research foundation** roadmap established
- **Dream realized** in foundational form

The Jekyll era has served its purpose: establishing The Chamber as a viable, sophisticated methodology for human-AI collaboration in philosophical inquiry. The Hakyll era will transform this foundation into an institutional platform capable of supporting the research foundation, Momento Mori Press, and P3 pedagogy.
