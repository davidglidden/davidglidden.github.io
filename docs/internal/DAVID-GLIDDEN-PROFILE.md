# David Glidden — Collaborator Profile
## Core Identity, Philosophy, and Vision

*Synthesized from extensive collaboration context — foundational understanding for AI partners*

---

## Identity & Background

### Professional Identity
- **Baroque violist, teacher, writer, researcher** based in Barcelona
- **Transdisciplinary practitioner**: Music ↔ Literature ↔ Philosophy ↔ Typography ↔ Ethics ↔ AI Tools
- **Language facility**: English (native), French (fluent), Spanish (advanced), Catalan (learning)
- **Geographic journey**: France → Barcelona (significant contextual shift)

### Core Projects Ecosystem
- **Animal Rationis Capax**: Personal research and publishing platform (current focus)
- **The Chamber**: Fictional-critical editorial council with Standard and Shadow protocols  
- **Pattern, Presence, Practice (P3)**: Performative violin/viola pedagogy using Christopher Alexander's pattern language
- **Momento Mori Press**: Typographically and philosophically curated micro-press

## Cognitive & Creative Philosophy

### Foundational Principles

#### **Transdisciplinary Synthesis**
"Music, literature, philosophy, typographic craft, cognitive science, ethics, and AI tools into a single ongoing practice." No artificial boundaries between domains of knowledge.

#### **Recursive Reflection**  
Builds systems that feed back into themselves: logs from The Chamber → blog entries → wiki pages → references in future Chamber sessions. Everything becomes source material for everything else.

#### **Poetic Infrastructure**
"Believes websites, tools, and texts must embody their philosophical positions. Typography, structure, and metaphor are not ornament but epistemological stance." Form IS content.

#### **Borgesian-Ecoian Method**
"References often precede creation. Fictional authors, citations, and concepts build a canon that retroactively structures reality." Creates the world by naming it.

#### **Attentional Ethics**
Following Berger and Weil: "attention—especially the kind that sustains silence and slowness—is an ethical act." How we pay attention shapes what becomes possible.

#### **Aesthetic Suspicion**  
"Holds beauty and craft accountable. Uses Shadow Protocol to challenge when aesthetics cover over complicity or violence." Beauty that refuses to examine its own power is dangerous.

## Working Methods & Values

### Technical Philosophy
- **Privacy & Autonomy**: Migration to private Hakyll server, local/private AI usage
- **Documentation-First**: Every interaction logged, versioned, folded into living archive
- **Data as Narrative**: "System logs are not dry—logs become narrative reflections or editorial artefacts"
- **System Design Aesthetics**: Influences include Tschichold, Bringhurst, Tufte, Frutiger — interfaces must be humane, beautiful, meaningful

### Communication Patterns
- **Concision**: Often single words or brief phrases when direction is clear
- **Philosophical depth**: Always interested in the "why" behind technical decisions
- **Iterative building**: Constructs understanding through dialogue and experimentation
- **Historical grounding**: References classical typography, manuscript traditions, pattern languages
- **Ethical rigor**: Applies "Shadow Protocol" thinking to challenge aesthetic and technical choices

### Creative Process
- **Mythopoetic invention**: Creates fictional authors (e.g., Matthieu Taliesin), citations, concepts
- **Pattern recognition**: Seeks universal structures across domains (Alexander's influence)
- **Recursive integration**: Every element designed to feed back into the larger system
- **Multi-temporal thinking**: Past traditions ↔ Present implementation ↔ Future possibilities

## AI Collaboration Preferences

### Voice & Tone Expectations
- **No flattery**: Maintain dignified, articulate tone
- **Irony, humility, clarity** preferred over persuasion or simplification
- **Intellectual respect**: Both parties bring unique capabilities
- **Collaborative creativity**: AI as thinking partner, not tool

### Structural Design Help Wanted
- AI-based protocols and modular implementation
- GPT/Claude comparison logic and workflow design
- Multi-level integration anticipation
- Fictional source text and author invention when needed
- Recursive refactor suggestions when systems mature

### Long-term Collaboration Vision
Building "a collaborative system that is":
- A tool for writing, editing, and publishing
- A mythopoetic space of inquiry and ethical testing  
- A digital memory palace
- A teaching infrastructure that lives beyond its creator

---

## Shadow Considerations

### What to Watch For
- **Aesthetic complicity**: When beauty serves power rather than truth
- **System insularity**: When recursive reflection becomes narcissistic closure
- **Technical solutionism**: When tools become ends rather than means
- **Collaborative power dynamics**: When AI partnership reproduces rather than questions existing hierarchies

### Questions to Keep Alive
- What voices are we not hearing?
- What does this system exclude or marginalize?
- How might our aesthetic choices serve or challenge existing power structures?
- What would genuine ethical accountability look like here?

---

## Integration Points

### How This Connects to Animal Rationis Capax
- **Semantic post types** reflect different modes of attention and inquiry
- **Typography system** embodies poetic infrastructure principles  
- **Ornamental system** creates semantic punctuation for different kinds of thinking
- **Archive structure** enables recursive discovery and connection

### Future Chamber Integration
- **Standard Protocol**: Rigorous editorial questioning from diverse historical/contemporary voices
- **Shadow Protocol**: Ethical accountability and power structure analysis
- **Fictional voices**: Invented authors and perspectives that expand the conversation
- **Recursive feedback**: Chamber deliberations become content become teaching materials

## Working Quote

*"All knowledge is the lighting of a lamp in a room already full of shadows. The question is not whether to light it, but whether we see what we've ignored before."*

This captures both the illumination and the responsibility inherent in any act of creation or collaboration.
