## June 2025 - Semantic Types Implementation

### Major Accomplishments
- **Glimpse semantic type**: Implemented pure image presentation without titles
- **Photo-essay semantic type**: Sequential visual narratives with proper framing
- **Ornamental system**: Complete set of semantic breathing marks
- **Type specimens page**: Full typography demonstration
- **Create scripts**: Automated glimpse and photo-essay generation

### Key Decisions & Rationale
- **Glimpse presentation**: No titles based on Berger's insight that "a glimpse is an event that happens to you"
- **Photo-essay framing**: Titles maintained because "a photo essay is a journey you choose to begin"
- **Layout differences**: Full-bleed for glimpses (interruption), text column for photo-essays (narrative contract)
- **Metadata approach**: Location and camera info as whisper-level context below images

### Design Dialogues
- Extensive consultation with Berger, Mohr, Alexander, Manutius on visual presentation
- Established that glimpses break reading frame while photo-essays maintain it
- Preserved reasoning in DESIGN-DIALOGUES.md

### Technical Implementations
- Modified `_layouts/post.html` to hide titles for glimpses, show metadata
- Updated `_sass/klise/_utilities.scss` for full-bleed image CSS
- Created executable Python scripts for content generation
- Converted 15+ observation posts to glimpse semantic type
