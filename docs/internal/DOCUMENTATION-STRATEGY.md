# Documentation Strategy
## Best Practices for Complex Creative-Technical Projects

*Comprehensive approach to maintaining project knowledge and context*

---

## Current State Assessment

### **Strengths** ✅
- **Clear information architecture**: Public/internal separation
- **Multi-layered approach**: Reference, memory, process, public docs
- **Living documentation philosophy**: Documents evolve with project
- **Version controlled**: All reasoning preserved and traceable
- **Context preservation**: Daily update routine prevents drift

### **Recent Improvements** ✅
- **Architecture Decision Records**: ✅ Implemented with 4 Chamber ADRs
- **User-facing documentation**: ✅ Chamber system has public-facing docs
- **Documentation hierarchy**: ✅ Clear internal/public separation established

### **Post-Hakyll Migration Priorities** 🔄
- **Automated validation**: Link checking, currency verification
- **Documentation debt tracking**: What's outdated or missing
- **Enhanced search**: Full-text search across documentation
- **Contributor guidelines**: For future collaborators

## Documentation Architecture

### **Information Hierarchy**

```
📁 Documentation System
├── 🚀 Quick Start (CLAUDE.md)
├── 📖 User Guides (style-guide.md, Chamber usage)
├── 🏗️ Architecture (technical requirements, system design)
├── 🤝 Collaboration (protocols, memory, workflows)
├── 📋 Decisions (ADRs, design dialogues)
├── 📈 Evolution (changelog, project memory)
└── 🔧 Internal (prompts, templates, working docs)
```

### **Audience-Specific Views**

**New Collaborator Path**:
1. CLAUDE.md → Basic orientation
2. COLLABORATION-PROTOCOL.md → Working patterns
3. PROJECT-MEMORY.md → Historical context
4. Style guides → Content standards

**User Path**:
1. README.md → Project overview
2. Chamber guides → How to engage
3. Typography guide → Understanding the system
4. Changelog → What's new

**Developer Path**:
1. CLAUDE.md → Essential commands
2. Technical requirements → System design
3. Architecture decisions → Why things work this way
4. Internal workflows → Implementation patterns

## Documentation Types & Standards

### **1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
*Format*: `docs/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-decision-title.md`

**Template**:
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Superseded]

## Context
[What forces led to this decision?]

## Decision
[What we decided to do]

## Consequences
[What happens as a result, positive and negative]

## Alternatives Considered
[What other options we evaluated]
```

**Example decisions to document**:
- Why Jekyll collections over custom taxonomy
- Shadow Protocol as essential rather than optional
- Gray source markers vs. colored system
- Manual Chamber workflow vs. automation

### **2. User Documentation Standards**
*Purpose*: Enable independent use of system features

**Chamber User Guide**: How to submit texts, understand protocols, read results
**Typography Guide**: How to read and interpret semantic types
**Navigation Guide**: How to use bliki functionality

### **3. API/System Documentation**
*Purpose*: Technical reference for implementation

**Jekyll Collections Schema**: Frontmatter requirements, relationship patterns
**CSS Class System**: Semantic types, modifiers, utility classes
**Chamber Notation**: Source markers, cross-reference patterns

### **4. Process Documentation**
*Purpose*: Repeatable workflows and procedures

**Chamber Session Processing**: Step-by-step protocol execution
**Content Creation**: Semantic type selection, file organization
**Documentation Maintenance**: Update triggers, quality checks

## Quality Assurance

### **Documentation Validation**

**Manual Checks** (weekly):
- [ ] All internal links resolve correctly
- [ ] Recent decisions documented in appropriate format
- [ ] User-facing changes reflected in guides
- [ ] No orphaned or outdated information

**Automated Validation** (future):
- Link checking for internal references
- Spell checking and style consistency
- Documentation currency warnings
- Cross-reference validation

### **Currency Metrics**

**Health Indicators**:
- Last update dates on critical documents
- Number of undocumented recent changes
- User questions that reveal documentation gaps
- Developer onboarding friction points

**Quality Targets**:
- PROJECT-MEMORY.md updated within 24 hours of major work
- COLLABORATION-PROTOCOL.md reflects current working patterns
- User guides enable independent feature use
- Technical docs support implementation decisions

---

## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Fill Critical Gaps** (Immediate)
- [ ] Create Chamber User Guide for public consumption
- [ ] Document first ADRs for major Chamber decisions
- [ ] Add contributor guidelines for future collaborators
- [ ] Create system overview for new developers

### **Phase 2: Systematic Improvement** (Next month)
- [ ] Implement ADR process for future decisions
- [ ] Add documentation quality checks to routine
- [ ] Create user feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Establish documentation debt tracking

### **Phase 3: Automation** (Future)
- [ ] Automated link checking
- [ ] Documentation build pipeline
- [ ] Currency monitoring
- [ ] Style guide enforcement

## Documentation Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### **Over-Documentation**
❌ Documenting every minor implementation detail
❌ Creating docs that duplicate code comments
❌ Writing for hypothetical future scenarios

### **Under-Documentation** 
❌ Skipping decision rationale
❌ Assuming context will be remembered
❌ Leaving user-facing features unexplained

### **Stale Documentation**
❌ Write-once, never-update approach
❌ No ownership or maintenance responsibility
❌ Ignoring user confusion signals

### **Wrong Audience**
❌ Technical details in user guides
❌ User instructions in developer docs
❌ Mixing process and reference information

---

## Success Metrics

### **For Complex Creative-Technical Projects**

**Knowledge Preservation**:
- New collaborators can become productive quickly
- Context survives extended breaks in development
- Decision rationale is discoverable when needed

**User Enablement**:
- Features can be used independently without asking questions
- System philosophy is clear and guides appropriate use
- Error recovery paths are documented

**Developer Efficiency**:
- Implementation decisions are traceable
- Architecture constraints are explicit
- Working patterns are codified and improvable

**Project Continuity**:
- Work can survive creator absence
- Complexity doesn't create maintenance burden
- Knowledge transfers to new maintainers

---

## Integration with Chamber System

### **Chamber as Documentation Generator**
The Chamber system itself creates documentation through:
- **Session deliberations**: Record of how texts transform
- **Meta-commentary**: Analysis of AI collaboration patterns
- **Fictional canon**: Bibliography that structures project thinking
- **Voice tracking**: Patterns of manifestation and refusal

### **Recursive Documentation**
- Design dialogues become source material for future decisions
- Chamber sessions inform collaboration protocol evolution
- Project memory feeds into fictional bibliography
- Documentation patterns influence Chamber development
