# Tools & Process: The Practice of Digital Craft

<blockquote class="poetic">
"The tool directs the mind, as the mind directs the tool."<br>
—<span class="small-caps">Richard Sennett</span>
</blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap">Every tool is a teacher. Some teach speed, others teach patience. Some fragment attention, others gather it. After years of chasing the newest and shiniest, I've learned to ask different questions: Does this tool make me more present? Does it invite return? Can it age into companionship?</p>

This page maps a practice—not a system. It's one violist's attempt to bring the ethics of musical craft into digital space. Take what resonates, leave what doesn't. The best workflow is the one you actually use.

## Two Lives: Home and Tour

### When Home Allows

The morning begins with paper and pencil. Not "morning pages"—that feels too prescribed, too self-conscious. Just writing. Whatever wants to emerge in the silence before screens wake. Dreams, observations, fragments of yesterday's rehearsal. The hand moving across paper slows time.

The tools matter here. Paper first: <span class="small-caps">Leuchtturm A6</span> notebooks for daily carry—European paper that takes fountain pen without bleeding. For longer-form thinking, <span class="small-caps">Midori MD A5</span> notebooks—Japanese paper so smooth it changes how you write. When I need real space to think—mapping connections, working out large-scale patterns—a <span class="small-caps">Postalco A4</span> Snap Pad opens the territory. Currently testing the <span class="small-caps">iA Notebook</span>, curious if their digital minimalism translates to analog.

This isn't fetishism. As Roland Allen shows in *The Notebook*, these objects carry civilizations. Lucien X. Polastron's *Une Brève Histoire de tous les livres* taught me that paper itself has memory—European sheets thick with sizing, Japanese papers breathing like skin. The tool shapes the thought.

Pens follow the same logic. At home: <span class="small-caps">Lamy 2000</span> fountain pens (M nib and cursive italic) or vintage <span class="small-caps">Parker 51s</span> from the <span class="oldstyle">1940s</span>—nothing matches their ink flow, but they're too precious for tour bags. On the road: the Lamy rollerball, reliable and uncomplaining. Inks mostly <span class="small-caps">Pilot Iroshizuku</span>—Japanese inks that shade like watercolors—plus carbon blacks for permanence.

For marginalia: <span class="small-caps">Tombow Mono 2B</span>, <span class="small-caps">Camel HB</span>, or <span class="small-caps">Blackwing</span> matte (RIP the original Blackwings), depending on the paper's tooth. For index cards: <span class="small-caps">Faber-Castell</span> propelling pencil or <span class="small-caps">Kaweco</span> mechanical. The precision matters when space is constrained.

For marking scores: <span class="small-caps">Mitsubishi Hi-Uni</span> in 4B or 6B—soft enough to mark without tearing, dark enough to see on the stand. <span class="small-caps">Koh-i-Noor</span> bicolor pencils (red/blue) for critical markings—fingerings in blue, bowings in red, or however the day's system emerges.

And always, the <span class="small-caps">Hinodewashi Matomaru-kun</span> eraser. "Matomaru" means "gathers"—the shavings collect into neat clumps instead of scattering. After years of eraser detritus on music stands, finding this was revelation. Clean desk, clean mind.

Only after coffee do the digital tools wake. The ritual matters: <span class="small-caps">Hario V60</span>, ceramic for its thermal mass. <span class="oldstyle">22</span>g coffee to <span class="oldstyle">360</span>g water. The bloom at <span class="oldstyle">0:45</span>, first pour to <span class="oldstyle">1:10</span>, pause for drawdown, final spiral to <span class="oldstyle">1:55</span>. Total time just under three minutes—long enough to transition from sleep to attention, short enough to maintain morning momentum. The <span class="small-caps">Fellow Opus</span> grinder at 6.25. Japanese filter paper. Water at <span class="oldstyle">94–96°C</span>.

Lynch drinks <span class="oldstyle">20</span> cups a day and claims it's where ideas swim. I keep it to three—but understand the principle. Coffee creates a kind of focused alertness where patterns emerge. This isn't about perfection but consistency. On tour it's hotel coffee, terrible but sufficient. At home, this ritual creates a threshold. The precision isn't fussiness—it's the same attention that goes into bow speed or finger weight. Craft is craft.

Water follows—<span class="oldstyle">2</span> liters daily, preferably cool. Not cold (contracts the throat), not warm (too soothing), but cool like morning air. Hydration as maintenance, not performance. The body is the first instrument.

<strong><span class="small-caps">Obsidian</span></strong> opens to yesterday's daily note. This is the workshop—where morning writing gets transcribed (selectively), where observations wait to become posts, where patterns slowly reveal themselves. No plugins except the essentials. No complex hierarchies. Just markdown files in folders, linked when connection emerges naturally.

<strong><span class="small-caps">iA Writer</span></strong> for drafting. When Obsidian is the workshop, Writer is the quiet room. No panels, no preview, no distractions. Just text and cursor. It enforces what monks knew: constraint liberates.

### When the Music Calls

Tour life breaks everything. <span class="oldstyle">4:30</span> <span class="small-caps">AM</span> lobby calls. Airports, trains, strange beds. The morning reflection persists—sometimes just five minutes with terrible hotel coffee—but the elaborate rituals dissolve.

This is when minimal tools matter:

<strong><span class="small-caps">Drafts</span></strong> on the phone captures what can't wait. A phrase overheard in soundcheck. The way light falls in a <span class="oldstyle">12th</span>-century chapel where we're performing. These fragments sync to the desktop whenever we land somewhere with wifi.

<strong><span class="small-caps">Working Copy</span></strong> for publishing fragments from anywhere. Nothing elaborate—full posts need the laptop—but sometimes an observation demands immediate release.

The practice adapts or dies. Some weeks, the only writing happens in departure lounges. That's enough.

## The Ecology of Tools

### For Thinking & Writing
- **Obsidian**: Pattern recognition, connection, the long memory
- **iA Writer**: Focused composition when something needs birthing
- **Physical notebooks**: More than I can count, each with its season
- **Index cards**: The Nabokov method—one idea per card, reorder until it sings
- **Oblique Strategies**: When truly stuck, Eno knows

### For Making
- **Jekyll**: This site's current engine (migration planned, but working for now)
- **GitHub**: Version control as memory palace
- **BBEdit**: For site code, technical editing, not content
- **Terminal**: Site development, never content
- **Python**: Custom scripts to parse writing and apply typography

### For Learning
- **Anki**: Language acquisition through spaced repetition
- **Physical books**: Still unmatched for sustained attention
- **Marginal notes**: In pencil, always pencil

### For Capturing
- **Drafts**: Everything starts here
- **Walkwriter action**: My custom Drafts action for mobile observations
- **Safari Reading List**: Temporary holding

## Why These Tools?

### Plain Text Everywhere
Every tool speaks plain text. No proprietary formats. No lock-in. What I write today will open in fifty years. This isn't Luddism; it's long-term thinking.

One may ask why not Notion, Roam, or whatever's current. I've watched too many tools die, taking years of work with them. Plain text is the cockroach of digital formats—it survives everything.

### Local First
Files live on my machine, backed up simply. The cloud is someone else's computer. I use it (GitHub, iCloud) but don't depend on it. If the internet vanished tomorrow, I could keep working.

### Boring Technology
Most of my tools are old. BBEdit from <span class="oldstyle">1992</span>. Jekyll from <span class="oldstyle">2008</span>. Terminal commands unchanged since the <span class="oldstyle">1970s</span>. Boring technology is proven technology. It does what it promises without surprises.

<div class="ornament thought"></div>

## The Harder Questions

### What I Don't Use
- **No task managers**. Tasks live on index cards, moved daily by hand. The physical sorting is part of thinking.
- **No Zoom**. Presence requires presence. I teach in person or not at all.
- **No comments**. This site broadcasts, it doesn't discuss. Conversation happens in email, slowly.

### Where I Struggle

**Analytics** remain unresolved. Building readership might require knowing who's reading, but the cost to simplicity feels high. Still thinking.

**Email** wants immediate response but deserves contemplation. I check twice daily, respond once. Still, it feels like a leak in the vessel.

**Instagram** exists—@quaerendoinvenietis—but I'm hopeless at it. Algorithms deciding what I see feels antithetical to chosen attention. It sits mostly dormant.

<div class="ornament section"></div>

## The Reality of Practice

There is no typical day. When home in Barcelona, mornings can unfold into long stretches of reading, writing, thinking. The ideal exists:

<span class="whisper">Morning writing → Obsidian review → Deep work in iA Writer → Afternoon teaching → Evening reflection</span>

But more often: A day somewhere, a few days elsewhere, maybe a week if we're lucky. Rehearsing <span class="oldstyle">9</span>–<span class="oldstyle">6</span>. Evenings for concerts. Early mornings for travel—or recovery when we stay more than one night. The tools compress into phone and notebook. Fragments accumulate until the next stretch home, when they're sorted, expanded, published, or discarded.

This isn't failure. It's reality. The practice that survives is the one that bends without breaking.

<div class="ornament philosophical"></div>

## Principles from Experience

What fifteen years of touring while trying to maintain a writing practice has taught:

1. **Essential over elaborate**. The minimal viable practice that travels.

2. **Rhythm over routine**. Routines break. Rhythms bend and return.

3. **Capture over craft**. On tour, just get it down. Craft comes later.

4. **Boring survives novelty**. The tool you'll use in five years matters more than what's exciting today.

5. **Physical anchors digital**. Paper and pencil ground everything else.

6. **Forgive the broken days**. And weeks. And months. Return is what matters.

<blockquote class="callout">
The practice isn't the tools. It's returning to the tools, however imperfectly, however interrupted.
</blockquote>

## For Fellow Travelers

Especially those balancing multiple lives:

**Start with what travels**. Build out from there.

**One capture method**. Everything else can vary.

**Weekly reviews**, not daily. More forgiving, more realistic.

**Seasonal tools**. Some for home, some for away.

**Document sparingly**. But document.

<div class="ornament personal"></div>

## The Meta-Practice

This page demonstrates the stack: Written in iA Writer during a blessed week home. Edited in BBEdit. Formatted in Markdown. Version-controlled in Git. Published via Jekyll. Each tool doing one thing well.

The site will migrate from Jekyll eventually—when there's time, when it matters enough. Until then, it works. That's enough.
