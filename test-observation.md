Half light the 22nd of December at 10:20. 

The apartment has a _fond d'air froid_, creeping cold, but not yet penetrating. 

My mind turns to Charles Ives: the sarabande from Bach's sixth keyboard partita playing softly in the livingroom is the anchor of this moment of experience.

A centered silence can open infinite paths to the outside.
