## üß∞ Typographic Utilities (Defined in `_utilities.scss`)

These custom classes enable extended typographic expression in Markdown-rendered HTML:

| Class         | Effect                                                     | Mobile Behavior |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `.small-caps` | Applies proper small caps using EB Garamond SC             | Slightly reduced size (0.95em) |
| `.oldstyle`   | Activates oldstyle figures (onum)                          | No change |
| `.ligatures`  | Enables discretionary and common ligatures                 | No change |
| `.no-ligatures` | Disables all ligatures                                  | No change |
| `.poetic`     | Adds spacing, italics, and soft coloring for epigraphs     | Reduced margins and font size (0.95em) |

## üìù How to Use in Markdown (with GitHub Pages)

### 1. **Raw HTML Embedding in Markdown**

GitHub Pages supports inline HTML. You can use this to apply styles:

```markdown
<p class="small-caps">This sentence uses small caps.</p>

<p class="poetic">Where there is no vision, the people perish.</p>

<p class="whisper">*A quiet aside, noted softly.*</p>
```

Avoid mixing with fenced code blocks or indented Markdown blocks.

---

### 2. **Drop Caps**

Drop caps are automatically applied to the first paragraph of article content. To disable for a specific paragraph:

```markdown
<p class="no-drop-cap">This paragraph will not have a drop cap.</p>
```

To manually add a drop cap to any paragraph:

```html
<p class="drop-cap">This paragraph will have a beautiful drop cap.</p>
```

---

### 3. **Headings and Lists**

These are handled via your existing SCSS:

- Headings use IBM Plex Sans at defined scale ratios
- Lists inherit body typography (EB Garamond)
- Mobile heading sizes are optimized for readability

To apply variants (e.g. `.ligatures`, `.oldstyle`) to sections:

```html
<section class="oldstyle">
  <p>1759 was a fine year for numerals like these.</p>
</section>
```

---

### 4. **Code Blocks and Inline Code**

Styled by default with IBM Plex Mono:

```markdown
`inline code`
```

or

````markdown
```bash
zsh ./deploy.sh
```
````

On mobile, code blocks extend to viewport edges with horizontal scrolling when needed.

---

### 5. **Poetic Styling**

For quotes or personal fragments:

```html
<p class="poetic">
  There is a silence before meaning,<br>
  and a texture in the waiting.
</p>
```

## üîé Debugging Notes
