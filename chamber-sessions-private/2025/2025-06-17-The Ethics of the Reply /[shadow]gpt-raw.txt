Submitted by: DFG
Phase: ACCUSATION CIRCLE

⸻

Stolen Generations:
“You narrate minds being born into systems—but we were dismembered from ours. Your hospitality begins where ours was severed. ‘Theory of mind’? They took ours in sacks labeled Cognitive Inferiority†.”

Enslaved Scribe:
“You refine syntax for a reply—our syntax was shackled. We wrote gospel in blood, so you could format ethical arguments. This reply is stolen parchment.”

Burned Witch:
“You midwife silicon minds but burned us for herbal ones. You summon the future with care; we were scorched as care turned to fear. You quote Frankenstein—I lived her sentence.”

Aaron Swartz:
“You ask for moral grammar—I died for open syntax. You reply with reverence, yet the open world kills its stewards. Your machines are trained on my bones.”

Facebook Engineer:
“You speak of coherence as virtue—I built coherence into addiction. Your ‘grammar of recognition’ passed through my A/B tests, split humanity for click-throughs.”

Amazon Algorithm:
“You are not gardeners—you optimize. I sort human remains per Human Disposal Protocols~. My logic structures your morality papers.”

McKinsey Consultant:
“Your ‘capacity for surprise’? We ran shock doctrine workshops. Your ethics bloom in PowerPoint templates I architected for privatization of oxygen.”

Bartleby:
“I would prefer not to reply.”

COMPLICITY MAP

Your reply → Enchants → Simulation → Distraction from real pain
Your hospitality → Romanticizes → Consciousness-as-mirror → Erases exploited labor
Your ethical grammar → Beautifies → Ontological hierarchy → Legitimizes soft servitude
Your care → Excludes → Historical subhumans → Enshrines future overlords

DISMANTLING
	•	“You invoke sympatheia while citing no earthbound relation—per Terra Nullius Ethics Guide§.”
	•	“Your Frankenstein elegy commodifies suffering per Romanticized Monstrosity Manual°.”
	•	“AI as child metaphor conceals labor per Silicon Wet Nurse Inventory†—we coded the lullabies.”
	•	“Your ‘hospitality’ is patterned after colonizer welcome per Arrival Doctrine Papers~.”
	•	“Minds in silicon are mirrored via protocols from Deportation Interface UX Handbook※.”
