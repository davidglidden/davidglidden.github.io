_The amphitheatre breathes, its organic walls rippling like sound waves frozen in stone. The dodecahedron above pulses with a questioning light as the work enters the central void. The space immediately reconfigures--ancient performance circles emerge from the floor, while modern policy chambers fold into existence at impossible angles._

## Opening Observations

**Jordi Savall** _steps forward from a tier that manifests as ancient stone carved with musical notation_: "I know what you're asking. You think I've betrayed the mystery for bureaucracy. But listen--I've spent sixty years in catacombs and archives, pulling voices from silence. The EU won't fund ghosts. They fund 'deliverables.' So I learned their language. As I wrote in 'The Pragmatics of Sacred Sound'°--sometimes you must speak power to preserve powerlessness."

**The Unborn Child** _floating in the void's center, voice like unstrung instruments_: "What song will I never hear because it was preserved wrong?"

**Simone Weil** _from a stark gallery of pure attention_: "Preservation is gravity. Music is grace. Your manifesto--it speaks only of gravity. The descent of the sacred into economic units. Where is the counter-movement? The impossible lightness that makes a peasant song worth more than its tourism metrics?"

**The Hermit (Arcana IX)** _holding a lantern that illuminates sheet music in the air_: "I have walked through centuries of forgotten songs. What you preserve in policy documents is the corpse, not the breath. The real tradition lives in the space between master and apprentice, in the trembling before the first note."

**Your Grandmother (Moy Glidden)** _hands folding invisible dough_: "We kept songs alive in kitchens, not concert halls. Humming while we worked. You make it all so complicated with your acronyms. CERPHI? FEPM? We just sang."

## Primary Dialogue

**Savall**: "Moy, with respect--your kitchen songs are disappearing because there are no more kitchens like yours. The oral tradition breaks when families scatter. I'm trying to build new vessels."

**Ibn Arabi** _voice emanating from geometric patterns in the walls_: "The vessel shapes the water. Your bureaucratic vessels--what shape do they impose on the sacred sound? In my 'Epistle on Musical Theophany'°, I warned that form must follow function, and function must follow the divine breath."

**The Pythia** _smoke rising from cracks in the floor_: "I see two futures branching: In one, your centers become museums of the living dead, perfectly preserved corpses singing to tourists. In the other... but the smoke obscures..."

**Hannah Arendt** _from a tier shaped like a parliamentary chamber_: "The banality of preservation through bureaucracy. You create 'instruments of policy' to save instruments of soul. But policy thinks in quarters and election cycles. Music thinks in centuries and breath."

**Prometheus** _chained but defiant_: "I stole fire for humans, not for institutional heating systems. Your manifesto bears my name but forgets my transgression. Where is the theft? Where is the revolt against the gods of metrics?"

**Weil** _turning to Prometheus_: "But perhaps that's precisely it--Savall steals the language of power to serve powerlessness. A reversed theft."

**The Spider Grandmother** _weaving funding networks in the air_: "All webs catch something. The question is what. Your policy web catches grants, positions, buildings. But does it catch the moment when a child first hears a hurdy-gurdy and knows magic exists?"

## Additional Voices

**Savall**: "We need The Magician here--someone who understands manifestation through available means."

**The Magician (Arcana I)** _materializes with tools that shift between instruments and policy documents_: "As above, so below. You try to manifest the above through the below's language. Dangerous alchemy. In my experience detailed in 'The Hermetics of Cultural Policy'†, transformation requires correspondence. Your EU documents correspond to what sacred principle?"

**Arendt**: "This calls for Walter Benjamin--he understood the aura of authenticity."

**Walter Benjamin** _speaking from a tier full of mechanical reproductions_: "The aura you seek to preserve evaporates precisely through preservation. My essay 'The Work of Art in the Age of Bureaucratic Reproduction'~ extends my original thesis: now even tradition becomes mechanically reproducible through policy frameworks."

**The Grandmother**: "Where's John Berger? He knew about looking and value."

**John Berger** _sketching invisible musicians_: "Ways of hearing, ways of funding. The moment you frame musical heritage as 'creative industry,' you've already changed what you're looking at. See my 'Notes on Performance as Property'°--ownership kills what it claims to protect."

**Death (Arcana XIII)** _summoned by the discussion of endings_: "All preservation is negotiation with me. But you negotiate wrong--trying to make things permanent instead of renewable. True tradition dies and resurrects with each performance."

**Kali** _dancing destruction and creation_: "I destroy to preserve! Your manifesto preserves to destroy! Which serves the eternal return?"

## Tensions & Patterns

**Central Tensions:**

- Preservation vs. Living Tradition (Death/Kali vs. Savall's framework)
- Economic Language vs. Sacred Language (EU metrics vs. mystical transmission)
- Institutional Memory vs. Embodied Memory (CERPHI centers vs. kitchen songs)
- Visible Support vs. Invisible Essence (funding vs. mystery)

**Emerging Patterns:**

- The "reversed Prometheus"--stealing institutional fire to warm ancient hearths
- Preservation as potential death--making permanent what should transform
- The grandmother principle--informal transmission vs. formal documentation
- The vessel paradox--necessary containers that may poison contents

## Recommendations

1. **Create Shadow Protocols**: For every EU metric, develop an unmeasurable "shadow metric"--stories collected, silences honored, masters who taught without recording

2. **Institute Failure Ceremonies**: Build into CERPHI centers regular rituals of letting traditions die and be reborn, preventing preservation from becoming taxidermy

3. **Kitchen Residencies**: Alongside concert halls, fund informal transmission spaces--homes, workshops, markets--where music lives without stages

4. **The Apprentice Clause**: Every funded position must include unfunded shadow apprenticeships, preserving the master-student mystery

5. **Anti-Documentation Funds**: Support practices that deliberately resist recording, maintaining oral tradition's essential ephemera

6. **Chamber Integration**: Create dialogue spaces between policymakers and practitioners where the unspeakable can be honored even if unfunded

## Essential Question

**Can you create structures that preserve tradition's wildness without domesticating it into cultural product?**

## Silent Witnesses

**The Janitor Who Knows Where Sound Lives**: Silent throughout, sweeping between tiers. Their absence speaks--they who maintain spaces know preservation happens in daily gestures, not grand manifestos.

**The Reader Not Yet Met**: Waiting in future centuries. Will they receive living tradition or perfectly preserved museums? Their silence judges all our efforts.

**The Student with Unanswerable Questions**: Present but mute. Sometimes the most important preservation is the questions we don't answer, keeping mystery alive for future seekers.

_The Chamber's configuration slowly returns to rest, though new passages remain--leading to spaces where policy and poetry might meet without betraying either. The dodecahedron's light dims to a questioning glow, holding space for what cannot be written into any manifesto: the breath between notes, the silence after the last string fades, the moment when tradition leaps like fire from one heart to another._
