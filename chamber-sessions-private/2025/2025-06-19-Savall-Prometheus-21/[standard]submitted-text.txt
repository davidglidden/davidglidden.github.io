Chamber Invocation: *On the Meaning of Preservation*

This week, in Brussels, a revised version of the *Prometheus 21* manifesto was presented to European policymakers. Spearheaded by Jordi Savall, the document outlines an ambitious strategy for rescuing early music from marginalization. It proposes new EU-level funding mechanisms, performance centers, and policy instruments to support historically-informed practices. It is detailed, confident, and institutionally articulate.

And yet—

It preserves the *sound* of tradition, perhaps, but does it protect its *essence*?

As I prepare to perform Beethoven’s symphonies in Vienna—a city where music once served not audiences, but time and spirit—I ask the Chamber:

- What does it mean to preserve a musical tradition in the 21st century?
- Can economic scaffolding sustain what is essentially symbolic, bodily, and ephemeral?
- Is something unspoken lost in Prometheus 21’s cultural logic?
- What role might the Chamber play in preserving not only the notes, but the *patterned knowing* within musical heritage?

## 📎 Summary Excerpt: *Prometheus 21* (for Chamber reference)

*Prometheus 21*, a strategic manifesto initiated by Jordi Savall, calls for a “New Cultural Deal” to rescue early music from institutional neglect. It positions historically-informed performance as a vital part of Europe’s intangible heritage and proposes structural reinvestment at the EU level. Key measures include:  
- The creation of **CERPHI** centers (European Reference Centres for HIP),  
- The formation of a **pan-European equalization fund** (FEPM),  
- Integration with Creative Europe and regional cohesion funds,  
- A proposed cultural tax credit for instrument restoration and performance-based commissioning.

The document shifts the frame from *preservation* to *economic value creation*, aligning with models from the World Bank and OECD. It suggests that for early music to survive, it must speak not only to cultural memory, but to policy logic, employment metrics, and tourism impact.

> The tension remains: can tradition thrive under metrics that ignore what cannot be measured?
