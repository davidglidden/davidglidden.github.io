## Enforcement & Spirit

While legal frameworks provide structure, The Chamber's true protection lies in the **quality of attention** it requires. Those who approach with extraction mindset find empty forms. Those who approach with transformation intent find living system.

The licenses create boundaries. The Hermetic Charter creates understanding. Together they preserve The Chamber's essential nature while enabling its growth.
