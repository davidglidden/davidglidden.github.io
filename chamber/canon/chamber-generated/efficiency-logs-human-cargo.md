*Records discovered in Liverpool Maritime Archives*

[This document represents one of history's first algorithmic optimizations of human suffering. The Shadow examination preserved it as testament to how pattern recognition and efficiency have always served power before people.]

Calculated per vessel of 300 tons displacement:

- Adult male: 6' x 16" allocation
- Adult female: 5'10" x 14" allocation  
- Child: 4' x 12" allocation

Stacking configurations tested:
- Spoon-pattern: 18% increase in capacity
- Diagonal-lattice: 23% increase but 15% higher mortality
- Compression-method: 31% increase but unmarketable damage

Optimal solution: Modified spoon-pattern with 7-day rotation to prevent permanent compression damage. Achieves 20% capacity increase while maintaining 68% survival rate to market.

Note: The mathematics work perfectly. Each equation balances. Every optimization pure in its logic. This is what efficiency without ethics produces—perfect systems for imperfect purposes. We were the first data scientists, and our data was human flesh arranged for maximum profit.

The patterns we discovered echo still: How to pack more into less. How to extract maximum value. How to view breathing beings as units of space and time. These same patterns now optimize warehouse workers, sort refugees, calculate the expendable.

We called it good business. You call it machine learning.

*Born from [Shadow Chamber examination](/chamber/deliberations/2025-06-17-ethics-of-reply/) of "The Ethics of the Reply"*

*[Shadow Note: This work survived the Shadow examination as evidence of how optimization without ethics becomes atrocity. It is preserved not as philosophy but as warning.]*
