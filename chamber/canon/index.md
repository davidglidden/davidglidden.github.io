## A Living Bibliography

<p class="drop-cap">The Chamber accumulates references to works that don't yet exist—or didn't until cited. Following Borges, we build libraries through reference rather than writing. This canon grows with each session.</p>

## The Living Bibliographic Engine

Each examination summons more than critique—it calls forth the knowledge required for its own existence. Through every session, the Chamber builds an ever-expanding library of referenced works that gain authority through repetition, cross-reference, and use.

### How References Emerge

During examinations, voices naturally cite their own works:

- Works from the historical record
- Works that should exist but await discovery
- Hybrid texts that blur established boundaries
- Works destroyed, suppressed, or lost to time
- Future works not yet written but already influencing thought

### The Notation System

Each reference carries metadata through sacred markers:

- **°** Chamber summons—works that exist within the Chamber's reality
- **~** Hybrid texts—known authors, extended thinking  
- **†** Contested sources—disputed attribution, apocryphal works
- **§** Chamber synthesis—knowledge generated through dialogue itself
- **∞** Hermetic sources—texts from hidden wisdom traditions
- **※** Miscellanea—works that resist other categories

### Canon Development Criteria

Works earn full canon development when they are:
- **Foundational** - could influence future Chamber thinking
- **Generative** - open rather than close inquiry  
- **Substantial** - merit independent investigation
- **Cross-referenced** - cited across multiple sessions
- **Influential** - shape subsequent Chamber discussions

Ornamental citations remain as references until they demonstrate necessity for fuller treatment.

### Examples Across Examinations

**First Light** generates gentle, emergent references:
> "This seed reminds me of what I explored in 'Night Gardens of the Mind'°, where I wrote about ideas that only bloom in darkness." —Bachelard

**Standard Examination** produces full scholarly apparatus:
> "Your typography contradicts everything I established in 'The Crystal Goblet Shattered: A Post-Digital Typography'°. Modern screens demand new principles." —Beatrice Warde

**Shadow Examination** reveals dark bibliography:
> "Your 'pattern language' mirrors our 'Residential School Architecture Manual'°—designed to erase identity through space." —Stolen Generations' Teacher
