# Notes on Unfolding Wholeness

*By Christopher Alexander*

## First Citation

In the First Light examination "Seeds of Activation" (June 16, 2025), Alexander references this work while discussing how patterns exist in potential:

> "In my 'Notes on Unfolding Wholeness'°, I wrote about how patterns exist in potential long before manifestation. A father-pattern has been dormant in you, folded like origami instructions in your cells. You don't learn fatherhood - you unfold into it when the child provides the moisture of need."

## Core Concepts

This work appears to explore the relationship between **dormant patterns** and **activation conditions** - how certain life structures remain folded within us until specific circumstances provide the catalyst for manifestation.

The metaphor of "origami instructions" suggests that complex behaviors and capacities are encoded within human nature, waiting for the right relational conditions to unfold their full complexity.

## Context in Alexander's Work

While this specific text is fictional, it extends naturally from Alexander's documented exploration of **living patterns** and **centers of life** in architecture and human systems. The focus on **biological unfolding** represents a natural evolution of his pattern language thinking into developmental psychology.
