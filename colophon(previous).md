## I. SITE  
### Philosophy and compass

**<span class="small-caps">Animal Rationis Capax</span>**  
*on art, work, and becoming*

<blockquote class="poetic">
  <strong>"Animal rationis capax"</strong><br>
  The animal capable of rationality.<br>
  —Attributed to <span class="small-caps">Jonathan Swift</span>, amending <span class="small-caps">Aristotle's</span> "rational animal"
</blockquote>

<!-- Drop cap will be automatically applied to the first paragraph -->
<p class="drop-cap">This phrase offers a profound redefinition of the human condition: not as a rational being, but as a being *capable* of rationality. It rescues us from the rigidity of essentialism and places us in a space of potential, process, and ethical growth.</p>

Rather than assuming we are always, or even usually, rational—it gently affirms our *capacity* to become so. This distinction has powerful implications across pedagogy, ethics, grief, identity, and metaphysics.

#### **I. Being vs. Becoming**

Swift replaces Aristotle’s static ontology with a dynamic view of selfhood. We are no longer beings who *are*, but selves in the making—becomings.

This echoes:  
- <span class="small-caps">Heraclitus</span>: "All is flux."  
- <span class="small-caps">Whitehead</span>: Reality as process  
- <span class="small-caps">Christopher Alexander</span>: The form of life is grown, not imposed

#### **II. Ethical Capacity**

To be human is not to always do right, but to be capable of recognizing, choosing, and realigning toward the good.

This vision is humbling and compassionate. It leaves room for:  
- Grace in failure  
- The ethics of attunement  
- Forgiveness without denial

#### **III. Pedagogical Orientation**

Teaching, like ethical growth, becomes a practice of cultivating conditions rather than imposing outcomes. This phrase aligns closely with my own pedagogical work: *Pattern, Presence, Practice*.

- The student is not a vessel to be filled, but a being capable of clarity  
- Teaching cultivates conditions for that clarity to emerge  
- Technique, presence, and repetition are modes of nurturing this capacity

#### **IV. Ways of Seeing**

This inquiry takes many forms across these pages: daily observations from life in Barcelona, reflections on works I’m performing, pedagogical experiments, musical speculations. Like a street photographer, I’m drawn to capture fleeting moments that reveal larger patterns—whether in the gesture of a student discovering bow distribution, the architecture of a Bach suite, or the quality of afternoon light filtering through Catalan streets.

My way of moving through the world has been shaped by four essential voices:

<span class="small-caps">**Christopher Alexander**</span> taught me that living structure emerges from careful attention to what wants to grow. His <em class="ligatures">Pattern Language</em> informs not only my pedagogical framework but my approach to daily observation—seeking the generative patterns that connect the small scale to the whole.

<span class="small-caps">**Gaston Bachelard**</span> revealed how spaces, objects, and moments carry emotional and philosophical weight. His poetics of space and phenomenology of elements help me read the deeper significance in seemingly ordinary encounters—the way a rehearsal room’s acoustics shape musical phrasing, or how the gesture of tuning contains the ethics of listening.

<span class="small-caps">**John Berger**</span> showed me that seeing is always a form of encounter, never neutral. His integration of art criticism, social observation, and personal reflection models the kind of attention I aspire to—one that recognizes the political and emotional dimensions embedded in aesthetic experience.

<span class="small-caps">**Richard Sennett**</span> reminds me that perception is not abstract; it is *tactile*, *practiced*, *formed through contact*. To see well is to handle the world with care. Just as a craftsman learns through the resistance of wood or metal, so too does the artist, teacher, or writer learn through the textures of daily work. <span class="small-caps">Sennett</span> offers an ethic of *involved seeing*—one that honors rhythm, repetition, and the deep time of skill.

Together, these four minds offer tools for recognizing that no moment is merely technical, no observation purely objective, no practice separate from the larger questions of how we choose to live.

### Interlude: The Desk

There is a desk beneath the window. Morning light from the northeast. The shutters open just enough to let the day arrive gently. A red writing mat anchors the surface. Papers rest in loose formations. A mechanical pencil. A thin notebook. A handmade mug, still warm.

The mug is thick-walled, unglazed at the base, ochre and grey like riverbank clay. It holds heat like a body, which feels honest. I don't reach for it so much as return to it. It's not the best mug. It's the one that understands waiting. Steam rises from the surface of the coffee in vapor-spirals.

My son is not yet born, but I feel his presence. He reshapes the silence around me. I write more slowly now--not because there is less time, but because the time I have feels newly textured. He is the breath before the phrase, the stillness before the page turns.

And my daughter—

She is not in this room, but the room bears her shape.  
The turn of the chair toward the light.  
The way I hesitate before beginning.  
The softness I now permit myself.  

There are days her absence presses against the edges of the morning. But even then, she is what steadies my hand. What draws me back to unfinished thoughts. What teaches me that holding on is not the same as not letting go.

This desk is not where I work.  
It's where I return, when I want to listen more carefully.  
To what matters.  
To who I'm becoming.  
To what love requires of me next.  
This is the room where I begin.

## II. TYPOGRAPHY

On Shape, Substance, and the Time of the Page

This site's typography is not decorative—it is <span class="small-caps">epistemological</span>. It expresses a belief: that form shapes thought, and that good design is not a matter of taste but of ethical and cognitive alignment.

The typographic system draws from centuries of typographic tradition and contemporary design craft. It aims for clarity without sterility, personality without pretension. Inspired by the quiet power of early printed books and the balanced restraint of modernist humanism, this system seeks legibility, rhythm, and grace.

### Core Typefaces

**Body: <span class="small-caps">EB Garamond</span>**  

A digital revival of <span class="small-caps">Claude Garamont's</span> <span class="oldstyle">16th</span>-century type, as interpreted by <span class="small-caps">Octavio Pardo</span> and <span class="small-caps">Georg Duffner</span>. With its calligraphic detail and generous spacing, it offers warmth, dignity, and a whisper of history—fitting for a site concerned with time, presence, and memory.

**Interface and Headings: <span class="small-caps">IBM Plex Sans</span>**  

Developed by <span class="small-caps">Bold Monday</span> and <span class="small-caps">IBM</span> to embody humanist engineering. Its rational structure and friendly tone pair well with <span class="small-caps">Garamond's</span> organic voice, offering contrast without dissonance.

**Code and Monospace: <span class="small-caps">IBM Plex Mono</span>**  

A companion to <span class="small-caps">Plex Sans</span>, used sparingly for technical contexts and subtle tonal shifts.

**Small Caps: <span class="small-caps">EB Garamond SC</span>**  

Used selectively for emphasis, hierarchy, and semantic nuance. True small caps, not faux transformations—typography that honors the microstructure of meaning.

### Responsive Typography

The type responds to its container, acknowledging that reading is contextual:

- **Mobile** (handheld distance): <span class="oldstyle">22</span>px base, <span class="oldstyle">1.75</span> line height—generous for the intimate screen
- **Tablet** (lap distance): <span class="oldstyle">20</span>px base—a middle ground
- **Desktop** (arm's length): <span class="oldstyle">21</span>px base, <span class="oldstyle">1.65</span> line height—refined for sustained reading

Maximum measure constrained to <span class="oldstyle">68</span> characters—the length of a comfortable thought.

### Classical Proportions

Images follow <span class="small-caps">Aldine</span> principles, creating visual harmony through mathematical relationships:
- **Standard images**: <span class="oldstyle">85</span>% width—leaving breathing room
- **Small images**: <span class="oldstyle">61.8</span>% width—the golden ratio (φ)
- **Large images**: Full width—for moments requiring emphasis

Captions whisper in <span class="oldstyle">14</span>px italic <span class="small-caps">Garamond</span>, centered and softly grey—annotations rather than interruptions.

### Expressive Typography

A palette of utility classes extends expression without breaking semantic structure:


- `.small-caps` — for names, concepts, gentle emphasis
- `.oldstyle` — numerals that sit within text, not upon it
- `.ligatures` — enabling the natural connections between letters
- `.no-ligatures` — sometimes silence is necessary
- `.poetic` — italicized breathing space for epigraphs
- `.callout` — bordered emphasis for crucial passages
- `.whisper` — subdued asides in smaller, softer voice 
- `.drop-cap` — marking significant beginnings


### Ornamental Punctuation

Horizontal rules transform into typographic ornaments--not mere dividers but breathing marks:

- **❦** (Aldus leaf) -- the default pause
- **⁂** (asterism) -- for triple emphasis or musical passages
- **❧** (rotated leaf) -- philosophical turns
- **◊** (lozenge) -- marking place and journey
- **• • •** (triple dots) -- softer transitions
- **§ § §** (section marks) -- structural divisions

These can be applied contextually: personal reflections marked with ❦, musical discussions punctuated by ⁂, philosophical asides turned with ❧.

### Drop Caps and Beginnings

Drop caps are no longer automatic but intentional—reserved for essays and significant openings. In manuscript tradition, the illuminated initial marked importance. Here too, drop caps signal that what follows deserves particular attention. Apply the `.essay` class to substantial pieces, or mark individual paragraphs with `.drop-cap`.

### Usage Philosophy

Typography is not neutral. Every ligature, line break, and space speaks. The system aspires to:

- **Invite attentive reading** through generous measure and breathing
- **Reflect craft time** through careful detailing and classical proportions
- **Embody ethical legibility** through clarity without sterility
- **Honor the text's rhythm** through responsive scaling and careful spacing

<blockquote class="poetic">
  "The page is a unit of space and time."
  —<span class="small-caps">Robert Bringhurst</span>
</blockquote>

This colophon itself demonstrates these principles: <span class="small-caps">small caps</span> marking concepts, <span class="oldstyle">oldstyle figures</span> in dates, ornaments as breathing marks, proportions that invite rather than hurry.

Typography here is not applied to text but grown from it—each choice emerging from attention to what the words themselves request. Not decoration, but a form of listening rendered visible.

“The artist constructs a new symbol with his brush. This symbol is not the likeness of a face, but the feeling of an event.”
— <span class="small-caps">John Berger</span>

## III. TOOLS

<blockquote class="poetic">
  *"The tool is the instructor of man."*
  —Not merely by enabling action, but by shaping attention, memory, and care.
</blockquote>

<span class="small-caps">Richard Sennett</span> writes that craftsmanship is a *slow unfolding of skill over time*, grounded not in raw talent but in the intimate relationship between hand, tool, and material. My tools reflect this ethic. They are chosen not for novelty or automation, but for how they cultivate my capacity to dwell within the work, to listen more attentively, and to think with my hands—even when those hands are typing, bowing, or sketching.

### Digital Practice

I work within a modular, text-centric digital environment—built around plain formats, transparent versioning, and slow knowledge.

- <span class="small-caps">**Obsidian**</span>: project architecture, memory curation, pattern archive  
- <span class="small-caps">**iA Writer**</span>: focused drafting in <span class="small-caps">Markdown</span>  
- <span class="small-caps">**BBEdit**</span>: regex scalpel, structure-refiner  
- <span class="small-caps">**iTerm2**</span> + `zsh`: for small automations and habit scripting  
- <span class="small-caps">**Anki**</span>: memory gardening, spaced repetition  
- <span class="small-caps">**Reeder**</span> + <span class="small-caps">**Safari**</span>: daily reading and research capture  
- <span class="small-caps">**Drafts**</span> + <span class="small-caps">**Notes.app**</span>: peripheral capture and idea drift  
- <span class="small-caps">**Transmit**</span>: file movement across servers  
- <span class="small-caps">**Working Copy**</span>: git, portable and honest  
- <span class="small-caps">**Audirvana**</span>: careful listening—not consumption, but attention

These tools are companions, not conveniences. They are refined by repeated use. They reward patience and fidelity.

### Mobile Mirror

My phone is a roaming atelier. Not ideal, but viable—mirroring core functions (Drafts, iA Writer, Working Copy) to allow continuity of thought across settings. When I’m traveling or parenting or waiting for rehearsal, the flow persists—smaller, slower, but intact.

### Analogue Continuity

Paper is not nostalgia. It is a tool with its own virtues.

- **<span class="oldstyle">100</span>×<span class="oldstyle">150</span>mm index cards** — for modular task and idea rotation.
- **<span class="small-caps">A6</span> Pocket notebook** — for fieldnotes, sketches, fragments  
- **Hand-crafted paper agenda** — for embodied planning and calendar tempo  
- **Tickler hotel notepads** — time’s gentle companion

I left digital task managers behind when they became systems I served. Pen and paper offer presence. They slow time. They produce a quieter kind of attention. As <span class="small-caps">Bachelard</span> might note, the graphite’s residue matters. The smudge is also a mark of thought.

### Rhythms and Maintenance

Every morning: the notebook, a stretch, a breath. Every evening: reflection, often brief, always handwritten. Once a week, I clean my desk. I review what remains. A practice is not kept alive through optimization, but through return.

### Philosophy of Use

<span class="small-caps">Alexander</span> asks: *Does it have the quality that cannot be named?*  
<span class="small-caps">Berger</span> reminds: *Every tool has a perspective.*  
<span class="small-caps">Bachelard</span> whispers: *The tool is also a room.*  
<span class="small-caps">Sennett</span> affirms: *The good tool teaches.*

These are the companions I consult. I choose tools not to finish faster, but to **stay longer** with what matters. Not for seamlessness, but for resonance. Not for automation, but for *attunement*.

<blockquote class="whisper">
  I no longer ask, <em>What can this tool do?</em><br>
  I ask:<br>
  <em>Does it foster presence?</em><br>
  <em>Does it invite care?</em><br>
  <em>Can it be part of a life worth making—again and again?</em>
