# About Animal Rationis Capax

<blockquote class="poetic">
"Every book is a quotation; and every house is a quotation out of all forests, and mines, and stone quarries; and every man is a quotation from all his ancestors."
—<span class="small-caps">Ralph Waldo Emerson</span>
</blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap">This site is a living manuscript—a space where observation, pattern recognition, and contemplative inquiry converge. It takes its name from Swift's amendment to Aristotle: we are not rational animals but animals *capable* of rationality. This distinction shapes everything here.</p>

## About David

I am a violist, teacher, and writer living in Barcelona. My days are shaped by music—playing viola with <span class="small-caps">Jordi Savall</span> and <span class="small-caps">Le Concert des Nations</span>, teaching through presence rather than prescription, seeking patterns that connect Bach to breath, Monteverdi to morning light.

This site is where those patterns find words.

## About This Site

The pages branch and fork, each path offering a different quality of attention:

### [Colophon](/colophon/)
The philosophical heart. Why this site exists, who guides the work—<span class="small-caps">Alexander</span>, <span class="small-caps">Bachelard</span>, <span class="small-caps">Berger</span>, and <span class="small-caps">Sennett</span>. Contains both manifesto and version history.

### [Typography](/typography/)
How letterforms shape thought. The conversation between <span class="small-caps">EB Garamond</span> and <span class="small-caps">IBM Plex</span>, between manuscript tradition and screen precision. Technical details for those who care about such things.

### [Navigation Philosophy](/navigation-philosophy/)
How interface responds to attention. A translucent header on mobile, a floating avatar on desktop—each viewport receives its own inevitable solution. Not mere responsive design but responsive presence, honoring how we hold devices and how they hold us.

### [What Kind of Attention Does This Require?](/attention/)
*Coming soon: The semantic post types that organize this site. Not categories but qualities of looking—observation, fragment, pattern, essay, meditation, and more. Each type is a room with its own quality of light.*

### [Tools & Process](/tools/)
The practice of digital craft. How a touring musician maintains a writing practice. Morning rituals, plain text philosophy, the democracy of pencils. What survives when everything else breaks.

### [Influences](/influences/)
A living constellation of teachers. From Fritz Lang's architectural poetry to Annie Dillard's fierce attention. Those who've shaped how I see, work, and listen. Growing always.

### [Now](/now/)
The present tense. Current tours, reading, teaching, thinking. What occupies attention this particular season. Updated when something essential shifts.

### [Patterns](/patterns/)
*Coming soon: The pedagogical framework that shapes my teaching. How pattern recognition becomes a practice of presence.*

## Navigation

This site uses what Alexander would recognize—navigation that appears when needed, not before:

- A quiet header with only essentials
- Breadcrumbs that orient without imposing  
- A greyscale avatar that reveals fuller navigation on scroll

The principle is *festina lente*—make haste slowly. The site resists urgency in favor of presence.

## Technical Notes

- Built with Jekyll, hosted on GitHub Pages
- Typography inspired by Aldus Manutius  
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Self-hosted fonts for consistency
- No tracking, no analytics, no comments

The only speed is yours.
