## Briefly 

### Avant-propos  

I was born into an artistically minded family in Manhattan, New York, in 1974 and spent my early years travelling between Europe, Canada, and the USA with my parents who practice the Spanish art of Flamenco, an art form of intensely energetic and emotional song and dance from the region of Andalusia. In spite of this nomadic lifestyle, my early interest in Western European Classical music endured and upon settling in Toronto in 1983 I began my formal musical training at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. Encouraged by my family to have the widest possible perspective, an education in a circle, I developed an interest in philosophy, philology, epistemology, aesthetics, informatics, history, and biology. Finally deciding that music would be my central discipline, I continued my formal education at Wilfrid Laurier University, and the Royal Conservatory in The Hague. I am fluent in English and French.

Besides studying with *Martin Beaver, Eugene Kash, David Stewart, Jerzy Kapłanek* and *Pavlo Beznosiuk*, I have also participated in masterclasses with *Steven Staryk, Jaap Schroeder, Anner Bylsma, the Orford Quartet, Arvo Pärt*, and *George Crumb*.

I was founding member of the ensembles [*Harmonie Universelle*](http://harmonie-universele.com) and [*Le Cercle de l’Harmonie*](http://cercledelharmonie.fr), and often play with such ensembles as *Capriccio Stravagante--Les 24 Violons, Les Nouveaux Caractères*, and *Opéra Fuoco*. I currently lead the viola sections of *Les Musiciens du Louvre*, and *Le Concert des Nations* for their seminal project, *ACADÈMIA BEETHOVEN 250*.

My chamber music partners have included *The Penderecki String Quartet (Canada), The Cambini Quartet-Paris (France), The Salzburger-Haydn Quintett (Austria), Hiro Kurosaki (Austria), Florian Deuter (Germany), Francesco Corti (Italy), Balazs Máté (Hungary), Dr. Herbert Lindsberger (Austria), Chouchane Siranossian (France), Josetxu Obregón (Spain)*, and *Jos van Immerseel (Belgium)*.

I have recorded for many music labels including *Deutsche Grammophon Archiv Productions, London Decca, Virgin Classics, CPO, Deutsche Harmonia Mundi, Paradizo, Accent, Glossa*, and *Alia Vox*.

In 2015–2016, I conceived of, organized, and recorded Mozart’s two *Piano Quartets, K.478 & K.493*, and several unknown fragments on the composer’s instruments at the Mozart-Wohnhaus in Salzburg as part of the Mozartwoche in co-operation with the International Mozarteum Foundation for the new edition of Mozart’s complete works, *Mozart225*, on Decca.

In 2016, as member of the Salzburger-Haydn Quintett, I was awarded the *ORF Ö1-„Pasticcio-Preis"* for our recording of the Complete String Quintets of Michael Haydn.

Also in 2016, I was one of the recipients of the *Förderpreis für Kultur der Stadt Salzburg* for my work on the documentary film Saudade on the life of Salzburg-born composer and diplomat Sigismund Neukomm.
