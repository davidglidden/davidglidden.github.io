# David F Glidden

## Biography

David F Glidden's artistic journey weaves together diverse musical traditions, shaped by a nomadic early life immersed in both flamenco and Western classical music. As principal violist for Le Concert des Nations under Jordi Savall and Les Musiciens du Louvre under Marc Minkowski, he brings transformative energy to ensemble sound through innovative string leadership.

Recognized for his masterful interpretations spanning music from the 17th to late 19th centuries, Glidden navigates the full spectrum of historical performance with both authenticity and creative vision. His deep understanding of period practices, combined with artistic sensitivity, has established him as a respected voice in the historical performance movement. A trusted member of Jordi Savall's artistic leadership circle, he contributes to developing young talent through service on the YOPCA audition committee, screening and selecting promising musicians for integration into major symphonic projects.

His interpretative depth, enriched by interdisciplinary studies in philosophy and aesthetics, has been recognized with the ORF Ö1-Pasticcio-Preis and Förderpreis für Kultur Stadt Salzburg. Glidden's extensive chamber music experience includes founding innovative ensembles such as Harmonie Universelle and Le Cercle de l'Harmonie, while collaborating with renowned artists including The Penderecki String Quartet, Le Quatuor Cambini-Paris, and the Salzburger-Haydn Quintett.

Notable recording achievements include Mozart's Piano Quartets performed on Mozart's own instruments (his violin, viola, and piano) at the Mozart-Wohnhaus in Salzburg and the complete String Quintets of Michael Haydn. Currently based in Barcelona, Glidden is developing an interdisciplinary collective exploring cultural transformations between 1880-1930, focusing on the birth of modernity in Barcelona, Paris, and Vienna. Through his performances and teaching, he continues to shape the future of period performance while fostering the next generation of musicians through an approach that integrates technical mastery with philosophical depth and artistic freedom.

Committed to nurturing emerging talent, David is available for private instruction, masterclasses, and mentorship both in-person and online. His teaching approach emphasizes historical techniques while developing each student's unique artistic voice.
