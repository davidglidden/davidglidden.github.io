# Now

<p class="whisper">Updated June 2025, from Barcelona</p>

## Playing

Just returned from Cremona—Monteverdi's *Vespers* with <span class="small-caps">Jordi Savall</span>, <span class="small-caps">Le Concert des Nations</span>, and <span class="small-caps">La Capella Reial de Catalunya</span>. The heart of violin country, where even the stones remember Stradivari. That final *Amen*—improvised, eternal. [Read the full reflection](/Vespers-with-Jordi/).

Preparing for Vienna, <span class="oldstyle">20–26</span> May: Beethoven Symphonies <span class="oldstyle">1</span>, <span class="oldstyle">2</span>, <span class="oldstyle">4</span>, <span class="oldstyle">8</span>, and <span class="oldstyle">9</span> at the <span class="small-caps">Wiener Konzerthaus</span>. The shift from Monteverdi's divine architecture to Beethoven's human struggle—this is why I love this work.

## Writing

## Teaching

<span class="small-caps">Brian Eno</span>—always, endlessly  
<span class="small-caps">Hania Rani</span>'s *On Giacometti*—sculpture translated to sound

## Living

Barcelona spring—the city between seasons. My son grows more present though not yet born. The desk by the northeast window remains the morning anchor when home. Walking the Gràcia streets, collecting patterns.
