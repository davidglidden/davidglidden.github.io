EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Saturday, July 20, 2024

I [HAD MY RECURRING]{.small} dream last night. I guess I should have
expected it. It comes to me when I struggle---when I twist on my own
personal hook and try to pretend that nothing unusual is happening. It
comes to me when I try to be my father's daughter. Today is our
birthday---my fifteenth and my father's fifty-fifth. Tomorrow, I'll try
to please him---him and the community and God. So last night, I dreamed
a reminder that it's all a lie. I think I need to write about the dream
because this particular lie bothers me so much.

I'm learning to fly, to levitate myself. No one is teaching me. I'm just
learning on my own, little by little, dream lesson by dream lesson. Not
a very subtle image, but a persistent one. I've had many lessons, and
I'm better at flying than I used to be. I trust my ability more now, but
I'm still afraid. I can't quite control my directions yet.

I lean forward toward the doorway. It's a doorway like the one between
my room and the hall. It seems to be a long way from me, but I lean
toward it. Holding my body stiff and tense, I let go of whatever I'm
grasping, whatever has kept me from rising or falling so far. And I lean
into the air, straining upward, not moving upward, but not quite falling
down either. Then I do begin to move, as though to slide on the air
drifting a few feet above the floor, caught between terror and joy.

I drift toward the doorway. Cool, pale light glows from it. Then I slide
a little to the right; and a little more. I can see that I'm going to
miss the door and hit the wall beside it, but I can't stop or turn. I
drift away from the door, away from the cool glow into another light.

The wall before me is burning. Fire has sprung from nowhere, has eaten
in through the wall, has begun to reach toward me, reach for me. The
fire spreads. I drift into it. It blazes up around me. I thrash and
scramble and try to swim back out of it, grabbing handfuls of air and
fire, kicking, burning! Darkness.

Perhaps I awake a little. I do sometimes when the fire swallows me.
That's bad. When I wake up all the way, I can't get back to sleep. I
try, but I've never been able to.

This time I don't wake up all the way. I fade into the second part of
the dream---the part that's ordinary and real, the part that did happen
years ago when I was little, though at the time it didn't seem to
matter.

Darkness.

Darkness brightening.

Stars.

Stars casting their cool, pale, glinting light.

"We couldn't see *so* many stars when I was little," my stepmother says
to me. She speaks in Spanish, her own first language. She stands still
and small, looking up at the broad sweep of the Milky Way. She and I
have gone out after dark to take the washing down from the clothesline.
The day has been hot, as usual, and we both like the cool darkness of
early night. There's no moon, but we can see very well. The sky is full
of stars.

The neighborhood wall is a massive, looming presence nearby. I see it as
a crouching animal, perhaps about to spring, more threatening than
protective. But my stepmother is there, and she isn't afraid. I stay
close to her. I'm seven years old.

I look up at the stars and the deep, black sky. "Why couldn't you see
the stars?" I ask her. "Everyone can see them." I speak in Spanish, too,
as she's taught me. It's an intimacy somehow.

"City lights," she says. "Lights, progress, growth, all those things
we're too hot and too poor to bother with anymore." She pauses. "When I
was your age, my mother told me that the stars---the few stars we could
see---were windows into heaven. Windows for God to look through to keep
an eye on us. I believed her for almost a year." My stepmother hands me
an armload of my youngest brother's diapers. I take them, walk back
toward the house where she has left her big wicker laundry basket, and
pile the diapers atop the rest of the clothes. The basket is full. I
look to see that my stepmother is not watching me, then let myself fall
backward onto the soft mound of stiff, clean clothes. For a moment, the
fall is like floating.

I lie there, looking up at the stars. I pick out some of the
constellations and name the stars that make them up. I've learned them
from an astronomy book that belonged to my father's mother.

I see the sudden light streak of a meteor flashing westward across the
sky. I stare after it, hoping to see another. Then my stepmother calls
me and I go back to her.

"There are city lights now," I say to her. "They don't hide the stars."

She shakes her head. "There aren't anywhere near as many as there were.
Kids today have no idea what a blaze of light cities used to be---and
not that long ago."

"I'd rather have the stars," I say.

"The stars are free." She shrugs. "I'd rather have the city lights back
myself, the sooner the better. But we can afford the stars."

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Sunday, July 21, 2024

A[T LEAST THREE YEARS]{.small} ago, my fathers God stopped being my God.
His church stopped being my church. And yet, today, because I'm a
coward, I let myself be initiated into that church. I let my father
baptize me in all three names of that God who isn't mine any more.

My God has another name.

We got up early this morning because we had to go across town to church.
Most Sundays, Dad holds church services in our front rooms. He's a
Baptist minister, and even though not all of the people who live within
our neighborhood walls are Baptists, those who feel the need to go to
church are glad to come to us. That way they don't have to risk going
outside where things are so dangerous and crazy. It's bad enough that
some people---my father for one---have to go out to work at least once a
week. None of us goes out to school any more. Adults get nervous about
kids going outside.

But today was special. For today, my father made arrangements with
another minister---a friend of his who still had a real church building
with a real baptistery.

Dad once had a church just a few blocks outside our wall. He began it
before there were so many walls. But after it had been slept in by the
homeless, robbed, and vandalized several times, someone poured gasoline
in and around it and burned it down. Seven of the homeless people
sleeping inside on that last night burned with it.

But somehow, Dad's friend Reverend Robinson has managed to keep his
church from being destroyed. We rode our bikes to it this morning---me,
two of my brothers, four other neighborhood kids who were ready to be
baptized, plus my father and some other neighborhood adults riding
shotgun. All the adults were armed. That's the rule. Go out in a bunch,
and go armed.

The alternative was to be baptized in the bathtub at home. That would
have been cheaper and safer and fine with me. I said so, but no one paid
attention to me. To the adults, going outside to a real church was like
stepping back into the good old days when there were churches all over
the place and too many lights and gasoline was for fueling cars and
trucks instead of for torching things. They never miss a chance to
relive the good old days or to tell kids how great it's going to be when
the country gets back on its feet and good times come back.

Yeah.

To us kids---most of us---the trip was just an adventure, an excuse to
go outside the wall. We would be baptized out of duty or as a kind of
insurance, but most of us aren't that much concerned with religion. I
am, but then I have a different religion.

"Why take chances," Silvia Dunn said to me a few days ago. "Maybe
there's something to all this religion stuff." Her parents thought there
was, so she was with us.

My brother Keith who was also with us didn't share any of my beliefs. He
just didn't care. Dad wanted him to be baptized, so what the hell. There
wasn't much that Keith did care about. He liked to hang out with his
friends and pretend to be grown up, dodge work and dodge school and
dodge church. He's only twelve, the oldest of my three brothers. I don't
like him much, but he's my stepmother's favorite. Three smart sons and
one dumb one, and it's the dumb one she loves best.

Keith looked around more than anyone as we rode. His ambition, if you
could call it that, is to get out of the neighborhood and go to Los
Angeles. He's never too clear about what he'll do there. He just wants
to go to the big city and make big money. According to my father, the
big city is a carcass covered with too many maggots. I think he's right,
though not all the maggots are in LA. They're here, too.

But maggots tend not to be early-morning types. We rode past people
stretched out, sleeping on the sidewalks, and a few just waking up, but
they paid no attention to us. I saw at least three people who weren't
going to wake up again, ever. One of them was headless. I caught myself
looking around for the head. After that, I tried not to look around at
all.

A woman, young, naked, and filthy stumbled along past us. I got a look
at her slack expression and realized that she was dazed or drunk or
something.

Maybe she had been raped so much that she was crazy. I'd heard stories
of that happening. Or maybe she was just high on drugs. The boys in our
group almost fell off their bikes, staring at her. What wonderful
religious thoughts they would be having for a while.

The naked woman never looked at us. I glanced back after we'd passed her
and saw that she had settled down in the weeds against someone else's
neighborhood wall.

A lot of our ride was along one neighborhood wall after another; some a
block long, some two blocks, some five. ... Up toward the hills there
were walled estates---one big house and a lot of shacky little
dependencies where the servants lived. We didn't pass anything like that
today. In fact we passed a couple of neighborhoods so poor that their
walls were made up of unmortared rocks, chunks of concrete, and trash.
Then there were the pitiful, unwalled residential areas. A lot of the
houses were trashed---burned, vandalized, infested with drunks or
druggies or squatted-in by homeless families with their filthy, gaunt,
half-naked children. Their kids were wide awake and watching us this
morning. I feel sorry for the little ones, but the ones my age and older
make me nervous. We ride down the middle of the cracked street, and the
kids come out and stand along the curb to stare at us. They just stand
and stare. I think if there were only one or two of us, or if they
couldn't see our guns, they might try to pull us down and steal our
bikes, our clothes, our shoes, whatever. Then what? Rape? Murder? We
could wind up like that naked woman, stumbling along, dazed, maybe hurt,
sure to attract dangerous attention unless she could steal some
clothing. I wish we could have given her something.

My stepmother says she and my father stopped to help an injured woman
once, and the guys who had injured her jumped out from behind a wall and
almost killed them.

And we're in Robledo---20 miles from Los Angeles, and, according to Dad,
once a rich, green, unwalled little city that he had been eager to
abandon when he was a young man. Like Keith, he had wanted to escape the
dullness of Robledo for big city excitement. L.A. was better then---less
lethal. He lived there for 21 years. Then in 2010, his parents were
murdered and he inherited their house. Whoever killed them had robbed
the house and smashed up the furniture, but they didn't torch anything.
There was no neighborhood wall back then.

Crazy to live without a wall to protect you. Even in Robledo, most of
the street poor---squatters, winos, junkies, homeless people in
general---are dangerous. They're desperate or crazy or both. That's
enough to make anyone dangerous.

Worse for me, they often have things wrong with them. They cut off each
other's ears, arms, legs. ... They carry untreated diseases and
festering wounds. They have no money to spend on water to wash with so
even the unwounded have sores. They don't get enough to eat so they're
malnourished---or they eat bad food and poison themselves. As I rode, I
tried not to look around at them, but I couldn't help
seeing---collecting---some of their general misery.

I can take a lot of pain without falling apart. I've had to learn to do
that. But it was hard, today, to keep peddling and keep up with the
others when just about everyone I saw made me feel worse and worse.

My father glanced back at me every now and then. He tells me, "You can
beat this thing. You don't have to give in to it." He has always
pretended, or perhaps believed, that my hyperempathy syndrome was
something I could shake off and forget about. The sharing isn't real,
after all. It isn't some magic or ESP that allows me to share the pain
or the pleasure of other people. It's delusional. Even I admit that. My
brother Keith used to pretend to be hurt just to trick me into sharing
his supposed pain. Once he used red ink as fake blood to make me bleed.
I was eleven then, and I still bled through the skin when I saw someone
else bleeding. I couldn't help doing it, and I always worried that it
would give me away to people outside the family.

I haven't shared bleeding with anyone since I was twelve and got my
first period. What a relief that was. I just wish all the rest of it had
gone away, too. Keith only tricked me into bleeding that once, and I
beat the hell out of him for it. I didn't fight much when I was little
because it hurt me so. I felt every blow that I struck, just as though
I'd hit myself. So when I did decide that I had to fight, I set out to
hurt the other kid more than kids usually hurt one another. I broke
Michael Talcott's arm and Rubin Quintanilla's nose. I knocked out four
of Silvia Dunn's teeth. They all earned what I did to them two or three
times over. I got punished every time, and I resented it. It was double
punishment, after all, and my father and stepmother knew it. But knowing
didn't stop them. I think they did it to satisfy the other kids'
parents. But when I beat up Keith, I knew that Cory or Dad or both of
them would punish me for it---my poor little brother, after all. So I
had to see that my poor little brother paid in advance. What I did to
him had to be worthwhile in spite of what they would do to me.

It was.

We both got it later from Dad---me for hurting a younger kid and Keith
for risking putting "family business" into the street. Dad is big on
privacy and "family business." There's a whole range of things we never
even hint about outside the family. First among these is anything about
my mother, my hyperempathy, and how the two are connected. To my father,
the whole business is shameful. He's a preacher and a professor and a
dean. A first wife who was a drug addict and a daughter who is drug
damaged is not something he wants to boast about. Lucky for me. Being
the most vulnerable person I know is damned sure not something I want to
boast about.

I can't do a thing about my hyperempathy, no matter what Dad thinks or
wants or wishes. I feel what I see others feeling or what I believe they
feel. Hyperempathy is what the doctors call an "organic delusional
syndrome." Big shit. It hurts, that's all I know. Thanks to Paracetco,
the small pill, the Einstein powder, the particular drug my mother chose
to abuse before my birth killed her, I'm crazy. I get a lot of grief
that doesn't belong to me, and that isn't real. But it hurts.

I'm supposed to share pleasure *and* pain, but there isn't much pleasure
around these days. About the only pleasure I've found that I enjoy
sharing is sex. I get the guy's good feeling and my own. I almost wish I
didn't. I live in a tiny, walled fish-bowl cul-de-sac community, and I'm
the preacher's daughter. There's a real limit to what I can do as far as
sex goes.

Anyway, my neurotransmitters are scrambled and they're going to stay
scrambled. But I can do okay as long as other people don't know about
me. Inside our neighborhood walls I do fine. Our rides today, though,
were hell. Going and coming, they were all the worst things I've ever
felt---shadows and ghosts, twists and jabs of unexpected pain.

If I don't look too long at old injuries, they don't hurt me too much.
There was a naked little boy whose skin was a mass of big red sores; a
man with a huge scab over the stump where his right hand used to be; a
little girl, naked, maybe seven years old with blood running down her
bare thighs. A woman with a swollen, bloody, beaten face. ...

I must have seemed jumpy. I glanced around like a bird, not letting my
gaze rest on anyone longer than it took me to see that they weren't
coming in my direction or aiming anything at me.

Dad may have read something of what I was feeling in my expression. I
try not to let my face show anything, but he's good at reading me.
Sometimes people say I look grim or angry. Better to have them think
that than know the truth. Better to have them think anything than let
them know just how easy it is to hurt me.

Dad had insisted on fresh, clean, potable water for the baptism. He
couldn't afford it, of course. Who could? That was the other reason for
the four extra kids:

Silvia Dunn, Hector Quintanilla, Curtis Talcott, and Drew Baiter, along
with my brothers Keith and Marcus. The other kids' parents had helped
with costs. They thought a proper baptism was important enough to spend
some money and take some risks. I was the oldest by about two months.
Curtis was next. As much as I hated being there, I hated even more that
Curtis was there. I care about him more than I want to. I care what he
thinks of me. I worry that I'll fall apart in public some day and he'll
see. But not today.

By the time we reached the fortress-church, my jaw-muscles hurt from
clinching and unclinching my teeth, and overall, I was exhausted.

There were only five or six dozen people at the service---enough to fill
up our front rooms at home and look like a big crowd. At the church,
though, with its surrounding wall and its security bars and Lazor wire
and its huge hollowness inside, and its armed guards, the crowd seemed a
tiny scattering of people. That was all right. The last thing I wanted
was a big audience to maybe trip me up with pain.

The baptism went just as planned. They sent us kids off to the bathrooms
("men's," "women's," "please do not put paper of any kind into toilets,"
"water for washing in bucket at left. ...") to undress and put on white
gowns. When we were ready, Curtis's father took us to an anteroom where
we could hear the preaching---from the first chapter of Saint John and
the second chapter of The Acts---and wait our turns.

My turn came last. I assume that was my father's idea. First the
neighbor kids, then my brothers, then me. For reasons that don't make a
lot of sense to me, Dad thinks I need more humility. I think my
particular biological humility---or humiliation---is more than enough.

What the hell? Someone had to be last. I just wish I could have been
courageous enough to skip the thing altogether.

So, "In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. ..."

Catholics get this stuff over with when they're babies. I wish Baptists
did. I almost wish I could believe it was important the way a lot of
people seem to, the way my father seems to. Failing that, I wish I
didn't care.

But I do. The idea of God is much on my mind these days. I've been
paying attention to what other people believe---whether they believe,
and if so what kind of God they believe in. Keith says God is just the
adults' way of trying to scare you into doing what they want. He doesn't
say that around Dad, but he says it. He believes in what he sees, and no
matter what's in front of him, he doesn't see much. I suppose Dad would
say that about me if he knew what I believe. Maybe he'd be right. But it
wouldn't stop me from seeing what I see.

A lot of people seem to believe in a big-daddy-God or a big-cop-God or a
big-king-God. They believe in a kind of super-person. A few believe God
is another word for nature. And nature turns out to mean just about
anything they happen not to understand or feel in control of.

Some say God is a spirit, a force, an ultimate reality. Ask seven people
what all of that means and you'll get seven different answers. So what
is God? Just another name for whatever makes you feel special and
protected?

There's a big, early-season storm blowing itself out in the Gulf of
Mexico. It's bounced around the Gulf, killing people from Florida to
Texas and down into Mexico. There are over 700 known dead so far. One
hurricane. And how many people has it hurt? How many are going to starve
later because of destroyed crops? That's nature. Is it God? Most of the
dead are the street poor who have nowhere to go and who don't hear the
warnings until it's too late for their feet to take them to safety.
Where's safety for them anyway? Is it a sin against God to be poor?
We're almost poor ourselves. There are fewer and fewer jobs among us,
more of us being born, more kids growing up with nothing to look forward
to. One way or another, we'll all be poor some day. The adults say
things will get better, but they never have. How will God---my father's
God---behave toward us when we're poor?

Is there a God? If there is, does he (she? it?) care about us? Deists
like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson believed God was something
that made us, then left us on our own.

"Misguided," Dad said when I asked him about Deists. "They should have
had more faith in what their Bibles told them."

I wonder if the people on the Gulf Coast still have faith. People have
had faith through horrible disasters before. I read a lot about that
kind of thing. I read a lot period. My favorite book of the Bible is
Job. I think it says more about my father's God in particular and gods
in general than anything else I've ever read.

In the book of Job, God says he made everything and he knows everything
so no one has any right to question what he does with any of it. Okay.
That works. That Old Testament God doesn't violate the way things are
now. But that God sounds a lot like Zeus---a super-powerful man, playing
with his toys the way my youngest brothers play with toy soldiers. Bang,
bang! Seven toys fall dead. If they're yours, you make the rules. Who
cares what the toys think. Wipe out a toy's family, then give it a brand
new family. Toy children, like Job's children, are interchangeable.

Maybe God is a kind of big kid, playing with his toys. If he is, what
difference does it make if 700 people get killed in a hurricane---or if
seven kids go to church and get dipped in a big tank of expensive water?

But what if all that is wrong? What if God is something else altogether?

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Tuesday, July 30, 2024

O[NE OF THE ASTRONAUTS]{.small} on the latest Mars mission has been
killed. Something went wrong with her protective suit and the rest of
her team couldn't get her back to the shelter in time to save her.
People here in the neighborhood are saying she had no business going to
Mars, anyway. All that money wasted on another crazy space trip when so
many people here on earth can't afford water, food, or shelter.

The cost of water has gone up again. And I heard on the news today that
more water peddlers are being killed. Peddlers sell water to squatters
and the street poor---and to people who've managed to hold on to their
homes, but not to pay their utility bills. Peddlers are being found with
their throats cut and their money and their handtrucks stolen. Dad says
water now costs several times as much as gasoline. But, except for
arsonists and the rich, most people have given up buying gasoline. No
one I know uses a gas-powered car, truck, or cycle. Vehicles like that
are rusting in driveways and being cannibalized for metal and plastic.

It's a lot harder to give up water.

Fashion helps. You're supposed to be dirty now. If you're clean, you
make a target of yourself. People think you're showing off, trying to be
better than they are. Among the younger kids, being clean is a great way
to start a fight. Cory won't let us stay dirty here in the neighborhood,
but we all have filthy clothes to wear outside the walls. Even inside,
my brothers throw dirt on themselves as soon as they get away from the
house. It's better than getting beaten up all the time.

Tonight the last big Window Wall television in the neighborhood went
dark for good. We saw the dead astronaut with all of red, rocky Mars
around her. We saw a dust-dry reservoir and three dead water peddlers
with their dirty-blue armbands and their heads cut halfway off. And we
saw whole blocks of boarded up buildings burning in Los Angeles. Of
course, no one would waste water trying to put such fires out.

Then the Window went dark. The sound had flickered up and down for
months, but the picture was always as promised---like looking through a
vast, open window.

The Yannis family has made a business of having people in to look
through their Window. Dad says that kind of unlicensed business isn't
legal, but he let us go to watch sometimes because he didn't see any
harm in it, and it helped the Yannises. A lot of small businesses are
illegal, even though they don't hurt anyone, and they keep a household
or two alive. The Yannis Window is about as old as I am. It covers the
long west wall of their living room. They must have had plenty of money
back when they bought it. For the past couple of years, though, they've
been charging admission---only letting in people from the
neighborhood---and selling fruit, fruit juice, acorn bread, or walnuts.
Whatever they had too much of in their garden, they found a way to sell.
They showed movies from their library and let us watch news and whatever
else was broadcast. They couldn't afford to subscribe to any of the new
multisensory stuff, and their old Window couldn't have received most of
it, anyway.

They have no reality vests, no touch-rings, and no headsets. Their setup
was just a plain, thin-screened Window.

All we have left now are three small, ancient, murky little TV sets
scattered around the neighborhood, a couple of computers used for work,
and radios. Every household still has at least one working radio. A lot
of our everyday news is from radio.

I wonder what Mrs. Yannis will do now. Her two sisters have moved in
with her, and they're working so maybe it will be all right. One is a
pharmacist and the other is a nurse. They don't earn much, but Mrs.
Yannis owns the house free and clear. It was her parents' house.

All three sisters are widows and between them they have twelve kids, all
younger than I am. Two years ago, Mr. Yannis, a dentist, was killed
while riding his electric cycle home from the walled, guarded clinic
where he worked. Mrs. Yannis says he was caught in a crossfire, hit from
two directions, then shot once more at close range. His bike was stolen.
The police investigated, collected their fee, and couldn't find a thing.
People get killed like that all the time. Unless it happens in front of
a police station, there are never any witnesses.

The dead astronaut is going to be brought back to Earth. She wanted to
be buried on Mars. She said that when she realized she was dying. She
said Mars was the one thing she had wanted all her life, and now she
would be part of it forever.

But the Secretary of Astronautics says no. He says her body might be a
contaminant. Idiot.

Can he believe that any microorganism living in or on her body would
have a prayer of surviving and going native in that cold, thin, lethal
ghost of an atmosphere? Maybe he can. Secretaries of Astronautics don't
have to know much about science. They have to know about politics.
Theirs is the youngest Cabinet department, and already it's fighting for
its life. Christopher Morpeth Donner, one of the men running for
President this year, has promised to abolish it if he's elected. My
father agrees with Donner.

"Bread and circuses," my father says when there's space news on the
radio. "Politicians and big corporations get the bread, and we get the
circuses."

"Space could be our future," I say. I believe that. As far as I'm
concerned, space exploration and colonization are among the few things
left over from the last century that can help us more than they hurt us.
It's hard to get anyone to see that, though, when there's so much
suffering going on just outside our walls.

Dad just looks at me and shakes his head. "You don't understand," he
says. "You don't have any idea what a criminal waste of time and money
that so-called space program is." He's going to vote for Donner. He's
the only person I know who's going to vote at all. Most people have
given up on politicians. After all, politicians have been promising to
return us to the glory, wealth, and order of the twentieth century ever
since I can remember. That's what the space program is about these days,
at least for politicians. Hey, we can run a space station, a station on
the moon, and soon, a colony on Mars. That proves we're still a great,
forward-looking, powerful nation, right?

Yeah.

Well, we're barely a nation at all anymore, but I'm glad we're still in
space. We have to be going some place other than down the toilet.

And I'm sorry that astronaut will be brought back from her own chosen
heaven. Her name was Alicia Catalina Godinez Leal. She was a chemist. I
intend to remember her. I think she can be a kind of model for me. She
spent her life heading for Mars---preparing herself, becoming an
astronaut, getting on a Mars crew, going to Mars, beginning to figure
out how to terraform Mars, beginning to create sheltered places where
people can live and work now. ...

Mars is a rock---cold, empty, almost airless, dead. Yet it's heaven in a
way. We can see it in the night sky, a whole other world, but too
nearby, too close within the reach of the people who've made such a hell
of life here on Earth.

Mrs. Sims shot herself today---or rather, she shot herself a few days
ago, and Cory and Dad found her today. Cory went a little crazy for a
while afterward.

Poor, sanctimonious, old Mrs. Sims. She used to sit in our front-room
church every Sunday, large-print Bible in hand, and shout out her
responses: "Yes, Lord!" "Hallelujah!" "Thank you, Jesus!" "Amen!" During
the rest of the week she sewed, made baskets, took care of her garden,
sold what she could from it, took care of pre-school children, and
talked about everyone who wasn't as holy as she thought she was.

She was the only person I've ever known who lived alone. She had a whole
big house to herself because she and the wife of her only son hated each
other. Her son and his family were poor, but they wouldn't live with
her. Too bad.

Different people frightened her in some deep, hard, ugly way. She didn't
like the Hsu family because they were Chinese and Hispanic, and the
older Chinese generation is still Buddhist. She's lived a couple of
doors up from them for longer than I've been alive, but they were still
from Saturn as far as she was concerned.

"Idolaters," she would call them if none of them were around. At least
she cared enough about neighborly relations to do her talking about them
behind their backs. They brought her peaches and figs and a length of
good cotton cloth last month when she was robbed.

That robbery was Mrs. Sims's first major tragedy. Three men climbed over
the neighborhood wall, cutting through the strands of barbed wire and
Lazor wire on top. Lazor wire is terrible stuff. It's so fine and sharp
that it slices into the wings or feet of birds who either don't see it
or see it and try to settle on it. People, though, can always find a way
over, under, or through.

Everyone brought Mrs. Sims things after the robbery, in spite of the way
she is. Was. Food, clothing, money. ... We took up collections for her
at church. The thieves had tied her up and left her---after one of them
raped her. An old lady like that! They grabbed all her food, her jewelry
that had once belonged to her mother, her clothes, and worse of all, her
supply of cash. It turns out she kept that---all of it---in a blue
plastic mixing bowl high up in her kitchen cabinet. Poor, crazy old
lady. She came to my father, crying and carrying on after the robbery
because now she couldn't buy the extra food she needed to supplement
what she grew. She couldn't pay her utility bills or her upcoming
property taxes. She would be thrown out of her house into the street!
She would starve!

Dad told her over and over that the church would never let that happen,
but she didn't believe him. She talked on and on about having to be a
beggar now, while Dad and Cory tried to reassure her. The funny thing
is, she didn't like us either because Dad had gone and married "that
Mexican woman Cory-ah-zan." It just isn't that hard to say "Corazon" if
that's what you choose to call her. Most people just call her Cory or
Mrs. Olamina.

Cory never let on that she was offended. She and Mrs. Sims were sugary
sweet to one another. A little more hypocrisy to keep the peace.

Last week Mrs. Sims's son, his five kids, his wife, her brother, and her
brother's three kids all died in a house fire---an arson fire. The son's
house had been in an unwalled area north and east of us, closer to the
foothills. It wasn't a bad area, but it was poor. Naked. One night
someone torched the house. Maybe it was a vengeance fire set by some
enemy of a family member or maybe some crazy just set it for fun. I've
heard there's a new illegal drug that makes people want to set fires.

Anyway, no one knows who did it to the Sims/Boyer families. No one saw
anything, of course.

And no one got out of the house. Odd, that. Eleven people, and no one
got out.

So about three days ago, Mrs. Sims shot herself. Dad said he'd heard
from the cops that it was about three days ago. That would have been
just two days after she heard about her son's death. Dad went to see her
this morning because she missed church yesterday. Cory forced herself to
go along because she thought she should. I wish she hadn't. To me, dead
bodies are disgusting. They stink, and if they're old enough, there are
maggots. But what the hell? They're dead. They aren't suffering, and if
you didn't like them when they were alive, why get so upset about their
being dead? Cory gets upset. She jumps on me for sharing pain with the
living, but she tries to share it with the dead.

I began writing this about Mrs. Sims because she killed herself. That's
what's upset me. She believed, like Dad, that if you kill yourself, you
go to hell and burn forever. She believed in a literal acceptance of
everything in the Bible. Yet, when things got to be too much for her,
she decided to trade pain for eternal pain in the hereafter.

How could she do that?

Did she really believe in anything at all? Was it all hypocrisy?

Or maybe she just went crazy because her God was demanding too much of
her. She was no Job. In real life, how many people are?

Saturday, August 17, 2024

I can't get Mrs. Sims out of my mind. Somehow, she and her suicide have
gotten tangled up with the astronaut and her death and her expulsion
from heaven. I need to write about what I believe. I need to begin to
put together the scattered verses that I've been writing about God since
I was twelve. Most of them aren't much good. They say what I need to
say, but they don't say it very well. A few are the way they should be.
They press on me, too, like the two deaths. I try to hide in all the
work there is to do here for the household, for my father's church, and
for the school Cory keeps to teach the neighborhood kids. The truth is,
I don't care about any of those things, but they keep me busy and make
me tired, and most of the time, I sleep without dreaming. And Dad beams
when people tell him how smart and industrious I am.

I love him. He's the best person I know, and I care what he thinks. I
wish I didn't, but I do.

For whatever it's worth, here's what I believe. It took me a lot of time
to understand it, then a lot more time with a dictionary and a thesaurus
to say it just right---just the way it has to be. In the past year, it's
gone through twenty-five or thirty lumpy, incoherent rewrites. This is
the right one, the true one. This is the one I keep coming back to:

***God is Power---***

***Infinite,***

***Irresistible,***

***Inexorable,***

***Indifferent.***

***And yet, God is Pliable---***

***Trickster,***

***Teacher,***

***Chaos,***

***Clay.***

***God exists to be shaped.***

***God is Change.***

This is the literal truth.

God can't be resisted or stopped, but can be shaped and focused. This
means God is not to be prayed to. Prayers only help the person doing the
praying, and then, only if they strengthen and focus that persons
resolve. If they're used that way, they can help us in our only real
relationship with God. They help us to shape God and to accept and work
with the shapes that God imposes on us. God is power, and in the end,
God prevails.

But we can rig the game in our own favor if we understand that God
exists to be shaped, and will be shaped, with or without our
forethought, with or without our intent.

That's what I know. That's some of it anyway. I'm not like Mrs. Sims.
I'm not some kind of potential Job, long suffering, stiff necked, then,
at last, either humble before an all-knowing almighty, or destroyed. My
God doesn't love me or hate me or watch over me or know me at all, and I
feel no love for or loyalty to my God. My God just is.

Maybe I'll be more like Alicia Leal, the astronaut. Like her, I believe
in something that I think my dying, denying, backward-looking people
need. I don't have all of it yet. I don't even know how to pass on what
I do have. I've got to learn to do that. It scares me how many things
I've got to learn. How will I learn them?

Is any of this real?

Dangerous question. Sometimes I don't know the answer. I doubt myself. I
doubt what I think I know. I try to forget about it. After all, if it's
real, why doesn't anyone else know about it. Every one knows that change
is inevitable. From the second law of thermodynamics to Darwinian
evolution, from Buddhism's insistence that nothing is permanent and all
suffering results from our delusions of permanence to the third chapter
of Ecclesiastes ("To everything there is a season"), change is part of
life, of existence, of the common wisdom. But I don't believe we're
dealing with all that that means. We haven't even begun to deal with it.

We give lip service to acceptance, as though acceptance were enough.
Then we go on to create super-people---super-parents, super-kings and
queens, super-cops---to be our gods and to look after us---to stand
between us and God. Yet God has been here all along, shaping us and
being shaped by us in no particular way or in too many ways at once like
an amoeba---or like a cancer. Chaos.

Even so, why can't I do what others have done---ignore the obvious. Live
a normal life. It's hard enough just to do that in this world.

But this thing (This idea? Philosophy? New religion?) won't let me
alone, won't let me forget it, won't let me go. Maybe. ... Maybe it's
like my sharing: One more weirdness; one more crazy, deep-rooted
delusion that I'm stuck with. I am stuck with it. And in time, I'll have
to do something about it. In spite of what my father will say or do to
me, in spite of the poisonous rottenness outside the wall where I might
be exiled, I'll have to do something about it.

That reality scares me to death.

President William Turner Smith lost yesterdays election. Christopher
Charles Morpeth Donner is our new President---President-elect. So what
are we in for? Donner has already said that as soon as possible after
his inauguration next year, he'll begin to dismantle the "wasteful,
pointless, unnecessary" moon and Mars programs. Near space programs
dealing with communications and experimentation will be
privatized---sold off.

Also, Donner has a plan for putting people back to work. He hopes to get
laws changed, suspend "overly restrictive" minimum wage, environmental,
and worker protection laws for those employers willing to take on
homeless employees and provide them with training and adequate room and
board.

What's adequate, I wonder: A house or apartment? A room? A bed in a
shared room? A barracks bed? Space on a floor? Space on the ground? And
what about people with big families? Won't they be seen as bad
investments? Won't it make much more sense for companies to hire single
people, childless couples, or, at most, people with only one or two
kids? I wonder.

And what about those suspended laws? Will it be legal to poison,
mutilate, or infect people---as long as you provide them with food,
water, and space to die?

Dad decided not to vote for Donner after all. He didn't vote for anyone.
He said politicians turned his stomach.

W[E HAD A FIRE]{.small} today. People worry so much about fire, but the
little kids will play with it if they can. We were lucky with this fire.
Amy Dunn, three years old, managed to start it in her family's garage.

Once the fire began to crawl up the wall, Amy got scared and ran into
the house. She knew she had done something bad, so she didn't tell
anyone. She hid under her grandmother's bed.

Out back, the dry wood of the garage burned fast and hot. Robin Baiter
saw the smoke and rang the emergency bell on the island in our street.
Robin's only ten, but she's a bright little kid---one of my stepmother's
star students. She keeps her head. If she hadn't alerted people as soon
as she saw the smoke, the fire could have spread.

I heard the bell and ran out like everyone else to see what was wrong.
The Dunns live across the street from us, so I couldn't miss the smoke.

The fire plan worked the way it was supposed to. The adult men and women
put the fire out with garden hoses, shovels, wet towels and blankets.
Those without hoses beat at the edges of the fire and smothered them
with dirt. Kids my age helped out where we were needed and put out any
new fires started by flying embers. We brought buckets to fill with
water, and shovels, blankets, and towels of our own. There were a lot of
us, and we kept our eyes open. The very old people watched the little
kids and kept them out of the way and out of trouble.

No one missed Amy. No one had seen her in the Dunn back yard, so no one
thought about her. Her grandmother found her much later and got the
truth out of her.

The garage was a total loss. Edwin Dunn salvaged some of his garden and
carpentry equipment, but not much. The grapefruit tree next to the
garage and the two peach trees behind it were half-burned, too, but they
might survive. The carrot, squash, collard, and potato plants were a
trampled mess.

Of course, no one called the fire department. No one would take on fire
service fees just to save an unoccupied garage. Most of our households
couldn't afford another big bill, anyway. The water wasted on putting
out the fire was going to be hard enough to pay for.

What will happen, I wonder, to poor little Amy Dunn. No one cares about
her. Her family feeds her and, now and then, cleans her up, but they
don't love her or even like her. Her mother Tracy is only a year older
than I am. She was 13 when Amy was born. She was 12 when her 27-year-old
uncle who had been raping her for years managed to make her pregnant.

Problem: Uncle Derek was a big, blond, handsome guy, funny and bright
and well-liked. Tracy was, is, dull and homely, sulky and dirty-looking.
Even when she's clean, she looks splotchy, dirty. Some of her problems
might have come from being raped by Uncle Derek for years. Uncle Derek
was Tracy's mother's youngest brother, her favorite brother, but when
people realized what he had been doing, the neighborhood men got
together and suggested he go live somewhere else. People didn't want him
around their daughters. Irrational as usual, Tracy's mother blamed Tracy
for his exile, and for her own embarrassment. Not many girls in the
neighborhood have babies before they drag some boy to my father and have
him unite them in holy matrimony. But there was no one to marry Tracy,
and no money for prenatal care or an abortion. And poor Amy, as she
grew, looked more and more like Tracy: scrawny and splotchy with sparse,
stringy hair. I don't think she'll ever be pretty.

Tracy's maternal instincts didn't kick in, and I doubt that her mother
Christmas Dunn has any. The Dunn family has a reputation for craziness.
There are sixteen of them living in the Dunn house, and at least a third
are nuts. Amy isn't crazy, though. Not yet. She's neglected and lonely,
and like any little kid left on her own too much, she finds ways to
amuse herself.

I've never seen anyone hit Amy or curse her or anything like that. The
Dunns do care what people think of them. But no one pays any attention
to her, either. She spends most of her time playing alone in the dirt.
She also eats the dirt and whatever she finds in it, including bugs. But
not long ago, just out of curiosity, I took her to our house, sponged
her off, taught her the alphabet, and showed her how to write her name.
She loved it. She's got a hungry, able little mind, and she loves
attention.

Tonight I asked Cory if Amy could start school early. Cory doesn't take
kids until they're five or close to five, but she said she'd let Amy in
if I would take charge of her. I expected that, though I don't like it.
I help with the five and six year olds, anyway. I've been taking care of
little kids since I was one, and I'm tired of it. I think, though, that
if someone doesn't help Amy now, someday she'll do something a lot worse
than burning down her family's garage.

Some cousins of old Mrs. Sims have inherited her house. They're lucky
there's still a house to inherit. If it weren't for our wall, the house
would have been gutted, taken over by squatters, or torched as soon as
it was empty. As it was, all people did was take back things they had
given to Mrs. Sims after she was robbed, and take whatever food she had
in the house. No sense letting it rot. We didn't take her furniture or
her rugs or her appliances. We could have, but we didn't. We aren't
thieves.

Wardell Parrish and Rosalee Payne think otherwise. They're both small,
rust-brown, sour-looking people like Mrs. Sims. They're the children of
a first cousin that Mrs. Sims had managed to keep contact and good
relations with. He's a widower twice over, no kids, and she's been
widowed once, seven kids. They're not only brother and sister, but
twins. Maybe that helps them get along with each other. They damn sure
won't get along with anyone else.

They're moving in today. They've been here a couple of times before to
look the place over, and I guess they must have liked it better than
their parents' house. They shared that with 18 other people. I was busy
in the den with my class of younger school kids, so I didn't meet them
until today, though I've heard Dad talking to them---heard them sit in
our living room and insinuate that we had cleaned out Mrs. Sims house
before they arrived.

Dad kept his temper. "You know she was robbed during the month before
she died," he said. "You can check with the police about that---if you
haven't already. Since then the community has protected the house. We
haven't used it or stripped it. If you choose to live among us, you
should understand that. We help each other, and we don't steal."

"I wouldn't expect you to say you did," Wardell Parrish muttered.

His sister jumped in before he could say more. "We're not accusing
anyone of anything," she lied. "We just wondered. ... We knew Cousin
Marjorie had some nice things---jewelry that she inherited from her
mother. ... Very valuable. ..."

"Check with the police," my father said.

"Well, yes, I know, but. ..."

"This is a small community," my father said. "We all know each other
here. We depend on each other."

There was a silence. Perhaps the twins were getting the message.

"We're not very social," Wardell Parrish said. "We mind our own
business."

Again his sister jumped in before he could go on. "I'm sure everything
will be all right," she said. "I'm sure we'll get along fine."

I didn't like them when I heard them. I liked them even less when I met
them. They look at us as though we smell and they don't. Of course, it
doesn't matter whether I like them or not. There are other people in the
neighborhood whom I don't like. But I don't trust the Payne-Parrishes.
The kids seem all right, but the adults. ... I wouldn't want to have to
depend on them. Not even for little things.

Payne and Parrish. What perfect names they have.

We ran into a pack of feral dogs today. We went to the hills today for
target practice---me, my father, Joanne Garfield, her cousin and
boyfriend Harold---Harry---Baiter, my boyfriend Curtis Talcott, his
brother Michael, Aura Moss and her brother Peter. Our other adult
Guardian was Joanne's father Jay. He's a good guy and a good shot. Dad
likes to work with him, although sometimes there are problems. The
Garfields and the Baiters are white, and the rest of us are black. That
can be dangerous these days. On the street, people are expected to fear
and hate everyone but their own kind, but with all of us armed and
watchful, people stared, but they let us alone. Our neighborhood is too
small for us to play those kinds of games.

Everything went as usual at first. The Talcotts got into an argument
first with each other, then with the Mosses. The Mosses are always
blaming other people for whatever they do wrong, so they tend to have
disputes outstanding with most of us. Peter Moss is the worst because
he's always trying to be like his father, and his father is a total
shit. His father has three wives. All at once, Karen, Natalie, and
Zahra. They've all got kids by him, though so far, Zahra, the youngest
and prettiest, only has one. Karen is the one with the marriage license,
but she let him get away with bringing in first one, then another new
woman into the house and calling them his wives. I guess the way things
are, she didn't think she could make it on her own with three kids when
he brought in Natalie and five by the time he found Zahra.

The Mosses don't come to church. Richard Moss has put together his own
religion---a combination of the Old Testament and historical West
African practices. He claims that God wants men to be patriarchs, rulers
and protectors of women, and fathers of as many children as possible.
He's an engineer for one of the big commercial water companies, so he
can afford to pick up beautiful, young homeless women and live with them
in polygamous relationships. He could pick up twenty women like that if
he could afford to feed them. I hear there's a lot of that kind of thing
going on in other neighborhoods. Some middle class men prove they're men
by having a lot of wives in temporary or permanent relationships. Some
upper class men prove they're men by having one wife and a lot of
beautiful, disposable young servant girls. Nasty. When the girls get
pregnant, if their rich employers won't protect them, the employers'
wives throw them out to starve.

Is that the way it's going to be, I wonder? Is that the future: Large
numbers of people stuck in either President-elect Donner's version of
slavery or Richard Moss's.

We rode our bikes to the top of River Street past the last neighborhood
walls, past the last ragged, unwalled houses, past the last stretch of
broken asphalt and rag and stick shacks of squatters and street poor who
stare at us in their horrible, empty way, and then higher into the hills
along a dirt road. At last we dismounted and walked our bikes down the
narrow trail into one of the canyons that we and others use for target
practice. It looked all right this time, but we always have to be
careful. People use canyons for a lot of things. If we find corpses in
one, we stay away from it for a while. Dad tries to shield us from what
goes on in the world, but he can't. Knowing that, he also tries to teach
us to shield ourselves.

Most of us have practiced at home with BB guns on homemade targets or on
squirrel and bird targets. I've done all that. My aim is good, but I
don't like it with the birds and squirrels. Dad was the one who insisted
on my learning to shoot them. He said moving targets would be good for
my aim. I think there was more to it than that. I think he wanted to see
whether or not I could do it---whether shooting a bird or a squirrel
would trigger my hyperempathy

It didn't, quite. I didn't like it, but it wasn't painful. It felt like
a big, soft, strange ghost blow, like getting hit with a huge ball of
air, but with no coolness, no feeling of wind. The blow, though still
soft, was a little harder with squirrels and sometimes rats than with
birds. All three had to be killed, though. They ate our food or ruined
it. Tree-crops were their special victims: Peaches, plums, figs,
persimmons, nuts. ... And crops like strawberries, blackberries, grapes.
... Whatever we planted, if they could get at it, they would. Birds are
particular pests because they can fly in, yet I like them. I envy their
ability to fly. Sometimes I get up and go out at dawn just so I can
watch them without anyone scaring them or shooting them. Now that I'm
old enough to go target shooting on Saturdays, I don't intend to shoot
any more birds, no matter what Dad says. Besides, just because I can
shoot a bird or a squirrel doesn't mean I could shoot a person---a thief
like the ones who robbed Mrs. Sims. I don't know whether I could do
that. And if I did it, I don't know what would happen to me. Would I
die?

It's my father's fault that we pay so much attention to guns and
shooting. He carries a nine millimeter automatic pistol whenever he
leaves the neighborhood. He carries it on his hip where people can see
it. He says that discourages mistakes. Armed people do get killed---most
often in crossfires or by snipers---but unarmed people get killed a lot
more often.

Dad also has a silenced nine millimeter submachine gun. It stays at home
with Cory in case something happens there while he's away. Both guns are
German---Heckler & Koch. Dad has never said where he got the submachine
gun. It's illegal, of course, so I don't blame him. It must have cost a
hell of a lot. He's only had it away from home a few times so he, Cory,
and I could get the feel of it. He'll do the same for the boys when
they're older.

Cory has an old Smith & Wesson .38 revolver that she's good with. She's
had it since before she married Dad. She loaned that one to me today.
Ours aren't the best or the newest guns in the neighborhood, but they
all work. Dad and Cory keep them in good condition. I have to help with
that now. And they spend the necessary time on practice and money on
ammunition.

At neighborhood association meetings, Dad used to push the adults of
every household to own weapons, maintain them, and know how to use them.
"Know how to use them so well," he's said more than once, "that you're
as able to defend yourself at two [A.M.]{.small} as you are at two
[P.M."]{.small}

At first there were a few neighbors who didn't like that---older ones
who said it was the job of the police to protect them, younger ones who
worried that their little children would find their guns, and religious
ones who didn't think a minister of the gospel should need guns. This
was several years ago.

"The police," my father told them, "may be able to avenge you, but they
can't protect you. Things are getting worse. And as for your children.
... Well, yes, there is risk. But you can put your guns out of their
reach while they're very young, and train them as they grow older.
That's what I mean to do. I believe they'll have a better chance of
growing up if you can protect them." He paused, stared at the people,
then went on. "I have a wife and five children," he said. "I will pray
for them all. I'll also see to it that they know how to defend
themselves. And for as long as I can, I will stand between my family and
any intruder." He paused again. "Now that's what I have to do. You all
do what you have to do."

By now there are at least two guns in every household. Dad says he
suspects that some of them are so well hidden---like Mrs. Sims'
gun---that they wouldn't be available in an emergency. He's working on
that.

All the kids who attend school at our house get gun handling
instruction. Once they've passed that and turned fifteen, two or three
of the neighborhood adults begin taking them to the hills for target
practice. It's a kind of rite of passage for us. My brother Keith has
been whining to go along whenever someone gets a shooting group
together, but the age rule is firm.

I worry about the way Keith wants to get his hands on the guns. Dad
doesn't seem to worry, but I do.

There are always a few groups of homeless people and packs of feral dogs
living out beyond the last hillside shacks. People and dogs hunt
rabbits, possums, squirrels, and each other. Both scavenge whatever
dies. The dogs used to belong to people---or their ancestors did. But
dogs eat meat. These days, no poor or middle class person who had an
edible piece of meat would give it to a dog. Rich people still keep
dogs, either because they like them or because they use them to guard
estates, enclaves, and businesses. The rich have plenty of other
security devices, but the dogs are extra insurance. Dogs scare people.

I did some shooting today, and I was leaning against a boulder, watching
others shoot, when I realized there was a dog nearby, watching me. Just
one dog---male, yellow-brown, sharp-eared, short-haired. He wasn't big
enough to make a meal of me, and I still had the Smith & Wesson, so
while he was looking me over, I took a good look at him. He was lean,
but he didn't look starved. He looked alert and curious. He sniffed the
air, and I remembered that dogs were supposed to be oriented more toward
scent than sight.

"Look at that," I said to Joanne Garfield who was standing nearby.

She turned, gasped, and jerked her gun up to aim at the dog. The dog
vanished into the dry brush and boulders. Turning, Joanne tried to look
everywhere as though she expected to see more dogs stalking us, but
there was nothing. She was shaking.

"I'm sorry," I said. "I didn't know you were afraid of them."

She drew a deep breath and looked at the place where the dog had been.
"I didn't know I was either," she whispered. "I've never been so close
to one before. I ... I wish I had gotten a better look at it."

At that moment, Aura Moss screamed and fired her fathers Llama
automatic.

I pushed away from the boulder and turned to see Aura pointing her gun
toward some rocks and babbling.

"It was over there!" she said, her words tumbling over one another. "It
was some kind of animal---dirty yellow with big teeth. It had its mouth
open. It was huge!"

"You stupid bitch, you almost shot me!" Michael Talcott shouted. I could
see now that he had ducked down behind a boulder. He would have been in
Aura's line of fire, but he didn't seem to be hurt.

"Put your gun away, Aura," my father said. He kept his voice low, but he
was angry. I could see that, whether Aura could or not.

"It was an animal," she insisted. "A big one. It might still be around."

"Aura!" My father raised his voice and hardened it.

Aura looked at him, then seemed to realize that she had more than a dog
to worry about. She looked at the gun in her hand, frowned, fumbled it
safe, and put it back into her holster.

"Mike?" my father said.

"I'm okay," Michael Talcott said. "No thanks to her!"

"It wasn't my fault," Aura said, right on cue. "There was an animal. It
could have killed you! It was sneaking up on us!"

"I think it was just a dog," I said. "There was one watching us over
here. Joanne moved and it ran away."

"You should have killed it," Peter Moss said. "What do you want to do?
Wait until it jumps someone."

"What was it doing?" Jay Garfield asked. "Just watching?"

"That's all," I said. "It didn't look sick or starved. It wasn't very
big. I don't think it was a danger to anyone here. There are too many of
us, and we're all too big."

"The thing I saw was huge," Aura insisted. "It had its mouth open!"

I went over to her because I'd had a sudden thought. "It was panting," I
said. "They pant when they're hot. It doesn't mean they're angry or
hungry." I hesitated, watching her. "You've never seen one before, have
you?"

She shook her head.

"They're bold, but they're not dangerous to a group like this. You don't
have to worry."

She didn't look as though she quite believed me, but she seemed to relax
a little. The Moss girls were both bullied and sheltered. They were
almost never allowed to leave the walls of the neighborhood. They were
educated at home by their mothers according to the religion their father
had assembled, and they were warned away from the sin and contamination
of the rest of the world. I'm surprised that Aura was allowed to come to
us for gun handling instruction and target practice. I hope it will be
good for her---and I hope the rest of us will survive.

"All of you stay where you are," Dad said. He glanced at Jay Garfield,
then went a short way up among the rocks and scrub oaks to see whether
Aura had shot anything. He kept his gun in his hand and the safety off.
He was out of our sight for no more than a minute.

He came back with a look on his face that I couldn't read. "Put your
guns away," he said. "We're going home."

"Did I kill it?" Aura demanded.

"No. Get your bikes." He and Jay Garfield whispered together for a
moment, and Jay Garfield sighed. Joanne and I watched them, wondering,
knowing we wouldn't hear anything from them until they were ready to
tell us.

"This is not about a dead dog," Harold Baiter said behind us. Joanne
moved back to stand beside him.

"It's about either a dog pack or a human pack," I said, "or maybe it's a
corpse."

It was, as I found out later, a family of corpses: A woman, a little boy
of about four years, and a just-born infant, all partly eaten. But Dad
didn't tell me that until we got home. At the canyon, all we knew was
that he was upset.

"If there were a corpse around here, we would have smelled it," Harry
said.

"Not if it were fresh," I countered.

Joanne looked at me and sighed the way her father sighs. "If its that, I
wonder where we'll go shooting next time. I wonder when there'll be a
next time."

Peter Moss and the Talcott brothers had gotten into an argument over
whose fault it was that Aura had almost shot Michael, and Dad had to
break it up. Then Dad checked with Aura to see that she was all right.
He said a few things to her that I couldn't hear, and I saw a tear slide
down her face. She cries easily. She always has.

Dad walked away from her looking harassed. He led us up the path out of
the canyon. We walked our bikes, and we all kept looking around. We
could see now that there were other dogs nearby. We were being watched
by a big pack. Jay Garfield brought up the rear, guarding our backs.

"He said we should stick together," Joanne told me. She had seen me
looking back at her father.

"You and I?"

"Yeah, and Harry. He said we should look out for one another."

"I don't think these dogs are stupid enough or hungry enough to attack
us in daylight. They'll go after some lone street person tonight."

"Shut up, for godsake."

The road was narrow going up and out of the canyon. It would have been a
bad place to have to fight off dogs. Someone could trip and step off the
crumbling edge. Someone could be knocked off the edge by a dog or by one
of us. That would mean falling several hundred feet.

Down below, I could hear dogs fighting now. We may have been close to
their dens or whatever they lived in. I thought maybe we were just close
to what they were feeding on.

"If they come," my father said in a quiet, even voice, "Freeze, aim, and
fire. That will save you. Nothing else will. Freeze, aim, and fire. Keep
your eyes open and stay calm."

I replayed the words in my mind as we went up the switchbacks. No doubt
Dad wanted us to replay them. I could see that Aura was still leaking
tears and smearing and streaking her face with dirt like a little kid.
She was too wrapped up in her own misery and fear to be of much use.

We got almost to the top before anything happened. We were beginning to
relax, I think. I hadn't seen a dog for a while. Then, from the front of
our line, we heard three shots.

We all froze, most of, us unable to see what had happened.

"Keep moving," my father called. "It's all right. It was just one dog
getting too close."

"Are you okay?" I called.

"Yes," he said. "Just come on and keep your eyes open."

One by one, we came abreast of the dog that had been shot and walked
past it. It was a bigger, grayer animal than the one I had seen. There
was a beauty to it. It looked like pictures I had seen of wolves. It was
wedged against a hanging boulder just a few steps up the steep canyon
wall from us.

It moved.

I saw its bloody wounds as it twisted. I bit my tongue as the pain I
knew it must feel became my pain. What to do? Keep walking? I couldn't.
One more step and I would fall and lie in the dirt, helpless against the
pain. Or I might fall into the canyon.

"It's still alive," Joanne said behind me. "It's moving."

Its forefeet were making little running motions, its claws scraping
against the rock.

I thought I would throw up. My belly hurt more and more until I felt
skewered through the middle. I leaned on my bike with my left arm. With
my right hand, I drew the Smith & Wesson, aimed, and shot the beautiful
dog through its head.

I felt the impact of the bullet as a hard, solid blow---something beyond
pain. Then I felt the dog die. I saw it jerk, shudder, stretch its body
long, then freeze. I saw it die. I felt it die. It went out like a match
in a sudden vanishing of pain. Its life flared up, then went out. I went
a little numb. Without the bike, I would have collapsed.

People had crowded close before and behind me. I heard them before I
could see them clearly.

"It's dead," I heard Joanne say "Poor thing."

"What?" my father demanded. "Another one?"

I managed to focus on him. He must have skirted close to the cliff-edge
of the road to have gotten all the way back to us. And he must have run.

"The same one," I said, managing to straighten up. "It wasn't dead. We
saw it moving."

"I put three bullets into it," he said.

"It was moving, Reverend Olamina," Joanne insisted. "It was suffering.
If Lauren hadn't shot it, someone else would have had to."

Dad sighed. "Well, it isn't suffering now. Let's get out of here." Then
he seemed to realize what Joanne had said. He looked at me. "Are you all
right?"

I nodded. I don't know how I looked. No one was reacting to me as though
I looked odd, so I must not have shown much of what I had gone through.
I think only Harry Baiter, Curtis Talcott, and Joanne had seen me shoot
the dog. I looked at them and Curtis grinned at me. He leaned against
his bike and in a slow, lazy motion, he drew an imaginary gun, took
careful aim at the dead dog, and fired an imaginary shot.

"Pow," he said. "Just like she does stuff like that every day Pow!"

"Let's go." My father said.

We began walking up the path again. We left the canyon and made our way
down to the street. There were no more dogs.

I walked, then rode in a daze, still not quite free of the dog I had
killed. I had felt it die, and yet I had not died. I had felt its pain
as though it were a human being. I had felt its life flare and go out,
and I was still alive.

Pow.

I[T'S RAINING.]{.small}

We heard last night on the radio that there was a storm sweeping in from
the Pacific, but most people didn't believe it. "We'll have wind," Cory
said. "Wind and maybe a few drops of rain, or maybe just a little cool
weather. That would be welcome. It's all we'll get."

That's all there has been for six years. I can remember the rain six
years ago, water swirling around the back porch, not high enough to come
into the house, but high enough to attract my brothers who wanted to
play in it. Cory, forever worried about infection, wouldn't let them.
She said they'd be splashing around in a soup of all the waste-water
germs we'd been watering our gardens with for years. Maybe she was
right, but kids all over the neighborhood covered themselves with mud
and earthworms that day, and nothing terrible happened to them.

But that storm was almost tropical---a quick, hard, warm, September
rain, the edge of a hurricane that hit Mexico's Pacific coast. This is a
colder, winter storm. It began this morning as people were coming to
church.

In the choir we sang rousing old hymns accompanied by Cory's piano
playing and lightning and thunder from outside. It was wonderful. Some
people missed part of the sermon, though, because they went home to put
out all the barrels, buckets, tubs, and pots they could find to catch
the free water. Other went home to put pots and buckets inside where
there were leaks in the roof.

I can't remember when any of us have had a roof repaired by a
professional. We all have Spanish tile roofs, and that's good. A tile
roof is, I suspect, more secure and lasting than wood or asphalt
shingles. But time, wind, and earthquakes have taken a toll. Tree limbs
have done some damage, too. Yet no one has extra money for anything as
nonessential as roof repair. At best, some of the neighborhood men go up
with whatever materials they can scavenge and create makeshift patches.
No one's even done that for a while. If it only rains once every six or
seven years, why bother?

Our roof is all right so far, and the barrels and things we put out
after services this morning are full or filling. Good, clean, free water
from the sky. If only it came more often.

Still raining.

No thunder today, though there was some last night. Steady drizzle, and
occasional, heavy showers all day. All day. So different and beautiful.
I've never felt so overwhelmed by water. I went out and walked in the
rain until I was soaked. Cory didn't want me to, but I did it anyway. It
was so wonderful. How can she not understand that? It was so incredible
and wonderful.

Amy Dunn is dead.

Three years old, unloved, and dead. That doesn't seem reasonable or even
possible. She could read simple words and count to thirty. I taught her.
She so much loved getting attention that she stuck to me during school
hours and drove me crazy. Didn't want me to go to the bathroom without
her.

Dead.

I had gotten to like her, even though she was a pest.

Today I walked her home after class. I had gotten into the habit of
walking her home because the Dunns wouldn't send anyone for her.

"She knows the way," Christmas said. "Just send her over. She'll get
here all right."

I didn't doubt that she could have. She could look across the street,
and across the center island, and see her house from ours, but Amy had a
tendency to wander. Sent home alone, she might get there or she might
wind up in the Montoya garden, grazing, or in the Moss rabbit house,
trying to let the rabbits out. So I walked her across, glad for an
excuse to get out in the rain again. Amy loved it, too, and we lingered
for a moment under the big avocado tree on the island. There was a navel
orange tree at the back end of the island, and I picked a pair of ripe
oranges---one for Amy and one for me. I peeled both of them, and we ate
them while the rain plastered Amy's scant colorless hair against her
head and made her look bald.

I took her to her door and left her in the care of her mother.

"You didn't have to get her so wet," Tracy complained.

"Might as well enjoy the rain while it lasts," I said, and I left them.

I saw Tracy take Amy into the house and shut the door. Yet somehow Amy
wound up outside again, wound up near the front gate, just opposite the
Garfield/Balter/Dory house. Jay Garfield found her there when he came
out to investigate what he thought was another bundle that someone had
thrown over the gate. People toss us things sometimes---gifts of envy
and hate: A maggoty, dead animal, a bag of shit, even an occasional
severed human limb or a dead child. Dead adults have been left lying
just beyond our wall. But these were all outsiders. Amy was one of us.

Someone shot Amy right through the metal gate. It had to be an
accidental hit because you can't see through our gate from the outside.
The shooter either fired at someone who was in front of the gate or
fired at the gate itself, at the neighborhood, at us and our supposed
wealth and privilege. Most bullets wouldn't have gotten through the
gate. It's supposed to be bulletproof. But it's been penetrated a couple
of times before, high up, near the top. Now we have six new bullet holes
in the lower portion---six holes and a seventh dent, a long, smooth
gouge where a bullet had glanced off without breaking through.

We hear so much gunfire, day and night, single shots and odd bursts of
automatic weapons fire, even occasional blasts from heavy artillery or
explosions from grenades or bigger bombs. We worry most about those last
things, but they're rare. It's harder to steal big weapons, and not many
people around here can afford to buy the illegal ones---or that's what
Dad says. The thing is, we hear gunfire so much that we don't hear it. A
couple of the Baiter kids said they heard shooting, but as usual, they
paid no attention to it. It was outside, beyond the wall, after all.
Most of us heard nothing except the rain.

Amy was going to turn four in a couple of weeks. I had planned to give
her a little party with my kindergartners.

God, I hate this place.

I mean, I love it. It's home. These are my people. But I hate it. It's
like an island surrounded by sharks---except that sharks don't bother
you unless you go in the water. But our land sharks are on their way in.
It's just a matter of how long it takes for them to get hungry enough.

Wednesday, March 5, 2025

I walked in the rain again this morning. It was cold, but good. Amy has
already been cremated. I wonder if her mother is relieved. She doesn't
look relieved. She never liked Amy, but now she cries. I don't think
she's faking. The family has spent money it could not afford to get the
police involved to try to find the killer. I suspect that the only good
this will do will be to chase away the people who live on the sidewalks
and streets nearest to our wall. Is that good? The street poor will be
back, and they won't love us for sicking the cops on them. It's illegal
to camp out on the street the way they do---the way they must---so the
cops knock them around, rob them if they have anything worth stealing,
then order them away or jail them. The miserable will be made even more
miserable. None of that can help Amy. I suppose, though, that it will
make the Dunns feel better about the way they treated her.

On Saturday, Dad will preach Amy's funeral. I wish I didn't have to be
there. Funerals have never bothered me before, but this one does.

"You cared about Amy," Joanne Garfield said to me when I complained to
her. We had lunch together today. We ate in my bedroom because it's
still raining off and on, and the rest of the house was full of all the
kids who hadn't gone home to eat lunch. But my room is still mine. It's
the one place in the world where I can go and not be followed by anyone
I don't invite in. I'm the only person I know who has a bedroom to
herself. These days, even Dad and Cory knock before they open my door.
That's one of the best things about being the only daughter in the
family. I have to kick my brothers out of here all the time, but at
least I can kick them out. Joanne is an only child, but she shares a
room with three younger girl cousins---whiny Lisa, always demanding and
complaining; smart, giggly Robin with her near-genius I.Q.; and
invisible Jessica who whispers and stares at her feet and cries if you
give her a dirty look. All three are Baiters---Harry's sisters and the
children of Joanne's mother's sister. The two adult sisters, their
husbands, their eight children, and their parents Mr. and Mrs. Dory are
all squeezed into one five-bedroom house. It isn't the most crowded
house in the neighborhood, but I'm glad I don't have to live like that.

"Almost no one cared about Amy," Joanne said. "But you did."

"After the fire, I did," I said. "I got scared for her then. Before
that, I ignored her like everyone else."

"So now you're feeling guilty?"

"No."

"Yes, you are."

I looked at her, surprised. "I mean it. No. I hate that she's dead, and
I miss her, but I didn't cause her death. I just can't deny what all
this says about us."

"What?"

I felt on the verge of talking to her about things I hadn't talked about
before. I'd written about them. Sometimes I write to keep from going
crazy. There's a world of things I don't feel free to talk to anyone
about.

But Joanne is a friend. She knows me better than most people, and she
has a brain. Why not talk to her? Sooner or later, I have to talk to
someone.

"What's wrong?" she asked. She had opened a plastic container of bean
salad. Now she put it down on my night table.

"Don't you ever wonder if maybe Amy and Mrs. Sims are the lucky ones?" I
asked. "I mean, don't you ever wonder what's going to happen to the rest
of us?"

There was a clap of dull, muffled thunder, and a sudden heavy shower.
Radio weather reports say today's rain will be the last of the four-day
series of storms. I hope not.

"Sure I think about it," Joanne said. "With people shooting little kids,
how can I not think about it?"

"People have been killing little kids since there've been people," I
said.

"Not in here, they haven't. Not until now."

"Yes, that's it, isn't it. We got a wake-up call. Another one."

"What are you talking about?"

"Amy was the first of us to be killed like that. She won't be the last."

Joanne sighed, and there was a little shudder in the sigh. "So you think
so, too."

"I do. But I didn't know you thought about it at all."

"Rape, robbery, and now murder. Of course I think about it. Everyone
thinks about it. Everyone worries. I wish I could get out of here."

"Where would you go?"

"That's it, isn't it? There's nowhere to go."

"There might be."

"Not if you don't have money. Not if all you know how to do is take care
of babies and cook."

I shook my head. "You know much more than that."

"Maybe, but none of it matters. I won't be able to afford college. I
won't be able to get a job or move out of my parents' house because no
job I could get would support me and there are no safe places to move.
Hell, my parents are still living with their parents."

"I know," I said. "And as bad as that is, there's more."

"Who needs more? That's enough!" She began to eat the bean salad. It
looked good, but I thought I might be about to ruin it for her.

"There's cholera spreading in southern Mississippi and Louisiana," I
said. "I heard about it on the radio yesterday. There are too many poor
people---illiterate, jobless, homeless, without decent sanitation or
clean water. They have plenty of water down there, but a lot of it is
polluted. And you know that drug that makes people want to set fires?"

She nodded, chewing.

"It's spreading again. It was on the east coast. Now it's in Chicago.
The reports say that it makes watching a fire better than sex. I don't
know whether the reporters are condemning it or advertising it." I drew
a deep breath. "Tornadoes are smashing hell out of Alabama, Kentucky,
Tennessee, and two or three other states. Three hundred people dead so
far. And there's a blizzard freezing the northern midwest, killing even
more people. In New York and New Jersey, a measles epidemic is killing
people. Measles!"

"I heard about the measles," Joanne said. "Strange. Even if people can't
afford immunizations, measles shouldn't kill."

"Those people are half dead already," I told her. "They've come through
the winter cold, hungry, already sick with other diseases. And, no, of
course they can't afford immunizations. We're lucky our parents found
the money to pay for all our immunizations. If we have kids, I don't see
how we'll be able to do even that for them."

"I know, I know." She sounded almost bored. "Things are bad. My mother
is hoping this new guy, President Donner, will start to get us back to
normal."

"Normal," I muttered. "I wonder what that is. Do you agree with your
mother?"

"No. Donner hasn't got a chance. I think he would fix things if he
could, but Harry says his ideas are scary. Harry says he'll set the
country back a hundred years."

"My father says something like that. I'm surprised that Harry agrees."

"He would. His own father thinks Donner is God. Harry wouldn't agree
with him on anything."

I laughed, distracted, thinking about Harry's battles with his father.
Neighborhood fireworks---plenty of flash, but no real fire.

"Why do you want to talk about this stuff," Joanne asked, bringing me
back to the real fire. "We can't do anything about it."

"We have to."

"Have to what? We're fifteen! What can we do?"

"We can get ready. That's what we've got to do now. Get ready for what's
going to happen, get ready to survive it, get ready to make a life
afterward. Get focused on arranging to survive so that we can do more
than just get batted around by crazy people, desperate people, thugs,
and leaders who don't know what they're doing!"

She just stared at me. "I don't know what you're talking about."

I was rolling---too fast, maybe. "I'm talking about this place, Jo, this
cul-de-sac with a wall around it. I'm talking about the day a big gang
of those hungry, desperate, crazy people outside decide to come in. I'm
talking about what we've got to do before that happens so that we can
survive and rebuild---or at least survive and escape to be something
other than beggars."

"Someone's going to just smash in our wall and come in?"

"More likely blast it down, or blast the gate open. It's going to happen
some day. You know that as well as I do."

"Oh, no I don't," she protested. She sat up straight, almost stiff, her
lunch forgotten for the moment. I bit into a piece of acorn bread that
was full of dried fruit and nuts. It's a favorite of mine, but I managed
to chew and swallow without tasting it.

"Jo, we're in for trouble. You've already admitted that."

"Sure," she said. "More shootings, more break-ins. That's what I meant."

"And that's what will happen for a while. I wish I could guess how long.
We'll be hit and hit and hit, then the big hit will come. And if we're
not ready for it, it will be like Jericho."

She held herself rigid, rejecting. "You don't know that! You can't read
the future. No one can."

"You can," I said, "if you want to. It's scary, but once you get past
the fear, it's easy. In LA. some walled communities bigger and stronger
than this one just aren't there any more. Nothing left but ruins, rats,
and squatters. What happened to them can happen to us. We'll die in here
unless we get busy now and work out ways to survive."

"If you think that, why don't you tell your parents. Warn them and see
what they say."

"I intend to as soon as I think of a way to do it that will reach them.
Besides ... I think they already know. I think my father does, anyway. I
think most of the adults know. They don't want to know, but they do."

"My mother could be right about Donner. He really could do some good."

"No. No, Donner's just a kind of human banister."

"A what?"

"I mean he's like ... like a symbol of the past for us to hold on to as
we're pushed into the future. He's nothing. No substance. But having him
there, the latest in a two-and-a-half-century-long line of American
Presidents make people feel that the country, the culture that they grew
up with is still here---that we'll get through these bad times and back
to normal."

"We could," she said. "We might. I think someday we will." No, she
didn't. She was too bright to take anything but the most superficial
comfort from her denial. But even superficial comfort is better than
none, I guess. I tried another tactic.

"Did you ever read about bubonic plague in medieval Europe?" I asked.

She nodded. She reads a lot the way I do, reads all kinds of things. "A
lot of the continent was depopulated," she said. "Some survivors thought
the world was coming to an end."

"Yes, but once they realized it wasn't, they also realized there was a
lot of vacant land available for the taking, and if they had a trade,
they realized they could demand better pay for their work. A lot of
things changed for the survivors."

"What's your point?"

"The changes." I thought for a moment. "They were slow changes compared
to anything that might happen here, but it took a plague to make some of
the people realize that things *could* change."

"So?"

"Things are changing now, too. Our adults haven't been wiped out by a
plague so they're still anchored in the past, waiting for the good old
days to come back. But things have changed a lot, and they'll change
more. Things are always changing. This is just one of the big jumps
instead of the little step-by-step changes that are easier to take.
People have changed the climate of the world. Now they're waiting for
the old days to come back."

"Your father says he doesn't believe people changed the climate in spite
of what scientists say. He says only God could change the world in such
an important way."

"Do you believe him?"

She opened her mouth, looked at me, then closed it again. After a while,
she said, "I don't know."

"My father has his blind spots," I said. "He's the best person I know,
but even he has blind spots."

"It doesn't make any difference," she said. "We can't make the climate
change back, no matter why it changed in the first place. You and I
can't. The neighborhood can't. We can't do anything."

I lost patience. "Then let's kill ourselves now and be done with it!"

She frowned, her round, too serious face almost angry. She tore bits of
peel from a small navel orange. "What then?" she demanded. "What can we
do?"

I put the last bite of my acorn bread down and went around her to my
night table. I took several books from the deep bottom drawer and showed
them to her. "This is what I've been doing---reading and studying these
over the past few months. These books are old like all the books in this
house. I've also been using Dad's computer when he lets me---to get new
stuff."

Frowning, she looked them over. Three books on survival in the
wilderness, three on guns and shooting, two each on handling medical
emergencies, California native and naturalized plants and their uses,
and basic living: logcabin-building, livestock raising, plant
cultivation, soap making---that kind of thing. Joanne caught on at once.

"What are you doing?" she asked. "Trying to learn to live off the land?"

"I'm trying to learn whatever I can that might help me survive out
there. I think we should all study books like these. I think we should
bury money and other necessities in the ground where thieves won't find
them. I think we should make emergency packs---grab and run packs---in
case we have to get out of here in a hurry. Money, food, clothing,
matches, a blanket. ... I think we should fix places outside where we
can meet in case we get separated. Hell, I think a lot of things. And I
know---I know!---that no matter how many things I think of, they won't
be enough. Every time I go outside, I try to imagine what it might be
like to live out there without walls, and I realize I don't know
anything."

"Then why---"

"I intend to survive."

She just stared.

"I mean to learn everything I can while I can," I said. "If I find
myself outside, maybe what I've learned will help me live long enough to
learn more."

She gave me a nervous smile. "You've been reading too many adventure
stories," she said.

I frowned. How could I reach her. "This isn't a joke, Jo."

"What is it then?" She ate the last section of her orange. "What do you
want me to say?"

"I want you to be serious. I realize I don't know very much. None of us
knows very much. But we can all learn more. Then we can teach one
another. We can stop denying reality or hoping it will go away by
magic."

"That's not what I'm doing."

I looked out for a moment at the rain, calming myself.

"Okay. Okay, what are you doing?"

She looked uncomfortable. "I'm still not sure we can really do
anything."

"Jo!"

"Tell me what I can do that won't get me in trouble or make everyone
think I'm crazy. Just tell me something."

At last. "Have you read all your family's books?"

"Some of them. Not all. They aren't all worth reading. Books aren't
going to save us."

"Nothing is going to save us. If we don't save ourselves, we're dead.
Now use your imagination. Is there anything on your family bookshelves
that might help you if you were stuck outside?"

"No."

"You answer too fast. Go home and look again. And like I said, use your
imagination. Any kind of survival information from encyclopedias,
biographies, anything that helps you learn to live off the land and
defend ourselves. Even some fiction might be useful."

She gave me a sidelong glance. "I'll bet," she said.

"Jo, if you never need this information, it won't do you any harm.
You'll just know a little more than you did before. So what? By the way,
do you take notes when you read?"

Guarded look. "Sometimes."

"Read this." I handed her one of the plant books. This one was about
California Indians, the plants they used, and how they used them---an
interesting, entertaining little book. She would be surprised. There was
nothing in it to scare her or threaten her or push her. I thought I had
already done enough of that.

"Take notes," I told her. "You'll remember better if you do."

"I still don't believe you," she said. "Things don't have to be as bad
as you say they are."

I put the book into her hands. "Hang on to your notes," I said. "Pay
special attention to the plants that grow between here and the coast and
between here and Oregon along the coast. I've marked them."

"I said I don't believe you."

"I don't care."

She looked down at the book, ran her hands over the black
cloth-and-cardboard binding. "So we learn to eat grass and live in the
bushes," she muttered.

"We learn to survive," I said. "It's a good book. Take care of it. You
know how my father is about his books."

Thursday, March 6, 2025

The rain stopped. My windows are on the north side of the house, and I
can see the clouds breaking up. They're being blown over the mountains
toward the desert. Surprising how fast they can move. The wind is strong
and cold now. It might cost us a few trees.

I wonder how many years it will be before we see rain again.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Saturday, March 8, 2025

J[OANNE TOLD.]{.small}

She told her mother who told her father who told my father who had one
of those serious talks with me.

Damn her. *Damn her!*

I saw her today at the service we had for Amy and yesterday at school.
She didn't say a word about what she had done. It turns out she told her
mother on Thursday. Maybe it was supposed to be a secret between them or
something. But, oh, Phillida Garfield was so concerned for me, so
worried. And she didn't like my scaring Joanne. Was Joanne scared? Not
scared enough to use her brain, it seems. Joanne always seemed so
sensible. Did she think getting me into trouble would make the danger go
away? No, that's not it. This is just more denial: A dumb little game of
"If we don't talk about bad things, maybe they won't happen." Idiot!
I'll never be able to tell her anything important again.

What if I'd been more open. What if I'd talked religion with her? I'd
wanted to. How will I ever be able to talk to anyone about that?

What I did say worked its way back to me tonight. Mr. Garfield talked to
Dad after the funeral. It was like the whispering game that little kids
play. The message went all the way from, "We're in danger here and we're
going to have to work hard to save ourselves," to "Lauren is talking
about running away because she's afraid that outsiders are going to riot
and tear down the walls and kill us all."

Well, I had said *some* of that, and Joanne had made it clear that she
didn't agree with me. But I hadn't just let the bad predictions stand
alone: "We're going to die, boo-hoo." What would be the point of that?
Still, only the negative stuff came home to me.

"Lauren, what did you say to Joanne?" my father demanded. He came to my
room after dinner when he should have been doing his final work on
tomorrow's sermon. He sat down on my one chair and stared at me in a way
that meant, "Where is your mind, girl? What's the matter with you?" That
look plus Joanne's name told me what had happened, what this was about.
My friend Joanne. *Damn her!*

I sat on my bed and looked back at him. "I told her we were in for some
bad, dangerous times," I said. "I warned her we ought to learn what we
could now so we could survive."

That was when he told me how upset Joanne's mother was, how upset Joanne
was, and how they both thought I needed to "talk to someone," because I
thought our world was coming to an end.

"Do you think our world is coming to an end?" Dad asked, and with no
warning at all, I almost started crying. I had all I could do to hold it
back. What I thought was, "No, I think *your* world is coming to an end,
and maybe you with it." That was terrible. I hadn't thought about it in
such a personal way before. I turned and looked out a window until I
felt calmer. When I faced him again, I said. "Yes. Don't you?"

He frowned. I don't think he expected me to say that. "You're fifteen,"
he said. "You don't really understand what's going on here. The problems
we have now have been building since long before you were born."

"I know."

He was still frowning. I wondered what he wanted me to say. "What were
you doing, then?" he asked. "Why did you say those things to Joanne?"

I decided to go on telling the truth for as long as I could. I hate to
lie to him. "What I said was true," I insisted.

"You don't have to say everything you think you know," he said. "Haven't
you figured that out yet?"

"Joanne and I were friends," I said. "I thought I could talk to her."

He shook his head. "These things frighten people. It's best not to talk
about them."

"But, Dad, that's like ... like ignoring a fire in the living room
because we're all in the kitchen, and, besides, house fires are too
scary to talk about."

"Don't warn Joanne or any of your other friends," he said. "Not now. I
know you think you're right, but you're not doing anyone any good.
You're just panicking people."

I managed to suppress a surge of anger by shifting the subject a little.
Sometimes the way to move Dad is to go at him from several directions.

"Did Mr. Garfield give you back your book?" I asked.

"What book?"

"I loaned Joanne a book about California plants and the ways Indians
used them. It was one of your books. I'm sorry I loaned it to her. It's
so neutral, I didn't think it could cause trouble. But I guess it has."

He looked startled, then he almost smiled. "Yes, I will have to have
that one back, all right. You wouldn't have the acorn bread you like so
much without that one---not to mention a few other things we take for
granted."

"Acorn bread ... ?"

He nodded. "Most of the people in this country don't eat acorns, you
know. They have no tradition of eating them, they don't know how to
prepare them, and for some reason, they find the idea of eating them
disgusting. Some of our neighbors wanted to cut down all our big live
oak trees and plant something useful. You wouldn't believe the time I
had changing their minds."

"What did people eat before?"

"Bread made of wheat and other grains---corn, rye, oats ... things like
that."

"Too expensive!"

"Didn't use to be. You get that book back from Joanne." He drew a deep
breath. "Now, let's get off the side track and back onto the main track.
What were you planning? Did you try to talk Joanne into running away?"

Then I sighed. "Of course not."

"Her father says you did."

"He's wrong. This was about staying alive, learning to live outside so
that we'd be able to if we ever had to."

He watched me as though he could read the truth in my mind. When I was
little, I used to think he could. "All right," he said. "You may have
meant well, but no more scare talk."

"It wasn't scare talk. We do need to learn what we can while there's
time."

"That's not up to you, Lauren. You don't make decisions for this
community."

Oh hell. If I could just find a balance between holding back too much
and pushing, poaching. "Yes, sir."

He leaned back and looked at me. "Tell me exactly what you told Joanne.
All of it."

I told him. I was careful to keep my voice flat and passionless, but I
didn't leave anything out. I wanted him to know, to understand what I
believed. The nonreligious part of it, anyway. When I finished, I
stopped and waited. He seemed to expect me to say more. He just sat
there for a while and stared at me. I couldn't tell what he felt. Other
people never could if he didn't want them to, but I've been able to most
of the time. Now I felt shut out, and there was nothing I could do about
it. I waited.

At last he let his breath out as though he had been holding it. "Don't
talk about this any more," he said in a voice that didn't invite
argument.

I looked back at him, not wanting to give a promise that would be a lie.

"Lauren."

"Dad."

"I want your promise that you won't talk about this any more."

What to say? I wouldn't promise. I couldn't. "We could make earthquake
packs," I suggested. "Emergency kits that we can grab in case we have to
get out of the house fast. If we call them earthquake packs, the idea
might not bother people so much. People are used to worrying about
earthquakes." All this came out in a rush.

"I want your promise, Daughter."

I slumped. "Why? You know I'm right. Even Mrs. Garfield must know it. So
why?"

I thought he would yell at me or punish me. His voice had had that
warning edge to it that my brothers and I had come to call the
rattle---as in a rattlesnake's warning sound. If you pushed him past the
rattle, you were in trouble. If he called you "son" or "daughter" you
were close to trouble.

"Why?" I insisted.

"Because you don't have any idea what you're doing," he said. He frowned
and rubbed his forehead. When he spoke again, the edge went out of his
voice. "It's better to teach people than to scare them, Lauren. If you
scare them and nothing happens, they lose their fear, and you lose some
of your authority with them. It's harder to scare them a second time,
harder to teach them, harder to win back their trust. Best to begin by
teaching." His mouth crooked into a little smile. "It's interesting that
you chose to begin your efforts with the book you lent to Joanne. Did
you ever think of teaching from that book?"

"Teaching ... my kindergartners?"

"Why not. Get them started on the right foot. You could even put
together a class for older kids and adults. Something like Mr. Ibarra's
wood carving class, Mrs. Baiter's needlework classes, and young Robert
Hsu's astronomy lectures. People are bored. They wouldn't mind another
informal class now that they've lost the Yannis television. If you can
think of ways to entertain them and teach them at the same time, you'll
get your information out. And all without making anyone look down."

"Look down ... ?"

"Into the abyss, Daughter." But I wasn't in trouble any more. Not at the
moment. "You've just noticed the abyss," he continued. "The adults in
this community have been balancing at the edge of it for more years than
you've been alive."

I got up, went over to him and took his hand. "It's getting worse, Dad."

"I know."

"Maybe it's time to look down. Time to look for some hand and foot holds
before we just get pushed in."

"That's why we have target practice every week and Lazor wire and our
emergency bell. Your idea for emergency packs is a good one. Some people
already have them. For earthquakes. Some will assemble them if I suggest
it. And, of course, some won't do anything at all. There are always
people who won't do anything."

"Will you suggest it?"

"Yes. At the next neighborhood association meeting."

"What else can we do? None of this is fast enough."

"It will have to be." He stood up, a tall, broad wall of a man. "Why
don't you ask around, see if anyone in the neighborhood knows anything
about martial arts. You need more than a book or two to learn good
dependable unarmed combat."

I blinked. "Okay."

"Check with old Mr. Hsu and Mr. and Mrs. Montoya."

"Mr. *and* Mrs.?"

"I think so. Talk to them about classes, not about Armageddon."

I looked up at him, and he looked more like a wall than ever, standing
and waiting. And he had offered me a lot---all I would get, I suspected.
I sighed. "Okay, Dad, I promise. I'll try not to scare anyone else. I
just hope things hold together long enough for us to do it your way."

And he echoed my sigh. "At last. Good. Now come out back with me. There
are some important things buried in the yard in sealed containers. It's
time for you to know where they are---just in case."

Today, Dad preached from Genesis six, Noah and the ark: "And God saw
that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every
imagination of the thoughts and of his heart was only evil continually.
And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it
grieved him at his heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man whom I
have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the
creeping thing and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have
made them. But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord."

And then, of course, later God says to Noah, "Make thee an ark of gopher
wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and
without with pitch."

Dad focused on the two-part nature of this situation. God decides to
destroy everything except Noah, his family, and some animals. *But* if
Noah is going to be saved, he has plenty of hard work to do.

Joanne came to me after church and said she was sorry for all the
craziness.

"Okay," I said.

"Still friends?" she asked.

And I hedged: "Not enemies, anyway. Get my fathers book back to me. He
wants it."

"My mother took it. I didn't know she'd get so upset."

"It isn't hers. Get it back to me. Or have your dad give it to mine. I
don't care. But he wants his book."

"All right."

I watched her leave the house. She looks so trustworthy---tall and
straight and serious and intelligent---I still feel inclined to trust
her. But I can't. I don't. She has no idea how much she could have hurt
me if I had given her just a few more words to use against me. I don't
think I'll ever trust her again, and I hate that. She was my best
friend. Now she isn't.

Wednesday, March 12, 2025

Garden thieves got in last night. They stripped citrus trees of fruit in
the Hsu yard and the Talcott yard. In the process, they trampled what
was left of winter gardens and much of the spring planting.

Dad says we have to set up a regular watch. He tried to call a
neighborhood association meeting for tonight, but it's a work night for
some people, including Gary Hsu who sleeps over at his job whenever he
has to report in person. We're supposed to get together for a meeting on
Saturday. Meanwhile, Dad got Jay Garfield, Wyatt and Kayla Talcott, Alex
Montoya, and Edwin Dunn together to patrol the neighborhood in shifts in
armed pairs. That meant that except for the Talcotts who are already a
pair (and who are so angry about their garden that I pity any thief who
gets in their way), the others have to find partners among the other
adults of the neighborhood.

"Find someone you trust to protect your back," I heard Dad tell the
little group. Each pair was to patrol for two hours from just before
dark to just after dawn. The first patrol, walking through or looking
into all the back yards would get people used to the idea of watchers
while they were still awake enough to understand.

"Make sure they see you if you get first watch," Dad said. "The sight of
you will remind them that there will be watchers all through the night.
We don't want any of them mistaking you for thieves."

Sensible. People go to bed soon after dark to save electricity, but
between dinner and darkness they spend time on their porches or in their
yards where it isn't so hot. Some listen to their radio on front or back
porches. Now and then people get together to play music, sing, play
board games, talk, or get out on the paved part of the street for
volleyball, touch football, basketball, or tennis. People used to play
baseball, but we just can't afford what that costs in windows. A few
people just find a corner and read a book while there's still daylight.
It's a good, comfortable, recreational time. What a pity to spoil it
with reminders of reality. But it can't be helped.

"What will you do if you catch a thief?" Cory asked my father before he
went out. He was on the second shift, and he and Cory were having a rare
cup of coffee together in the kitchen while he waited. Coffee was for
special occasions. I couldn't miss the good smell of it in my room where
I lay awake.

I eavesdrop. I don't put drinking glasses to walls or crouch with my ear
against doors, but I do often lie awake long after dark when we kids are
all supposed to be asleep. The kitchen is across the hall from my room,
the dining room is nearby at the end of the hall, and my parents' room
is next door. The house is old and well insulated. If there's a shut
door between me and the conversation, I can't hear much. But at night
with all or most of the lights out, I can leave my door open a crack,
and if other doors are also open, I can hear a lot. I learn a lot.

"We'll chase him off, I hope," Dad said. "We've agreed to that. We'll
give him a good scare and let him know there are easier ways to get a
dollar."

"A dollar ... ?"

"Yes, indeed. Our thieves didn't steal all that food because they were
hungry. They stripped those trees---took everything they could."

"I know," Cory said. "I took some lemons and grapefruits to both the
Hsus and the Wyatts today and told them they could pick from our trees
when they needed more. I took them some seed, too. They both had a lot
of young plants trampled, but this early in the season, they should be
able to repair the damage."

"Yes." My father paused. "But you see my point. People steal that way
for money. They're not desperate. Just greedy and dangerous. We might be
able to scare them into looking for easier pickings."

"But what if you can't?" Cory asked, almost whispering. Her voice fell
so low that I was afraid I would miss something.

"If you can't, will you shoot them?"

"Yes," he said.

"... yes?" she repeated in that same small voice. "Just ... 'yes?'" She
was like Joanne all over again---denial personified. What planet do
people like that live on?

"Yes," my father said.

*"Why!"*

There was a long silence. When my father spoke again, his own voice had
gone very soft. "Baby, if these people steal enough, they'll force us to
spend more than we can afford on food---or go hungry. We live on the
edge as it is. You know how hard things are.

"But ... couldn't we just call the police?"

"For what? We can't afford their fees, and anyway, they're not
interested until after a crime has been committed. Even then, if you
call them, they won't show up for hours---maybe not for two or three
days."

"I know."

"What are you saying then? You want the kids to go hungry? You want
thieves coming into the house once they've stripped the gardens?"

"But they haven't done that."

"Of course they have. Mrs. Sims was only their latest victim."

"She lived alone. We always said she shouldn't do that."

"You want to trust them not to hurt you or the kids just because there
are seven of us? Baby, we can't live by pretending this is still twenty
or thirty years ago."

"But you could go to jail!" She was crying---not sobbing, but speaking
with that voice-full-of-tears that she can manage sometimes.

"No," Dad said. "If we have to shoot someone, we're together in it.
After we've shot him we carry him into the nearest house. It's still
legal to shoot housebreakers. After that we do a little damage and get
our stories straight."

Long, long silence. "You could still get in trouble."

"I'll risk it."

Another long silence. "'Thou shalt not kill,'" Cory whispered.

"Nehemiah four," Dad said. "Verse 14."

There was nothing more. A few minutes later, I heard Dad leave. I waited
until I heard Cory go to her room and shut the door. Then I got up, shut
my door, moved my lamp so the light wouldn't show under the door, then
turned it on and opened my grandmother's Bible. She had had a lot of
Bibles and Dad had let me keep this one.

Nehemiah, chapter four, Verse 14: "And I looked and rose up and said
unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, be
not afraid of them: remember the Lord which is great and terrible, and
fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives and
your houses."

Interesting. Interesting that Dad had that verse ready, and that Cory
recognized it. Maybe they've had this conversation before.

Saturday, March 15, 2025

It's official.

Now we have a regular neighborhood watch---a roster of people from every
household who are over eighteen, good with guns---their own and
others---and considered responsible by my father and by the people who
have already been patrolling the neighborhood. Since none of the
watchers have ever been cops or security guards, they'll go on working
in pairs, watching out for each other as well as for the neighborhood.
They'll use whistles to call for help if they need it. Also, they'll
meet once a week to read, discuss, and practice martial arts and
shoot-out techniques. The Montoyas will give their martial arts classes,
all right, but not at my suggestion. Old Mr. Hsu is having back
problems, and he won't be teaching anything for a while, but the
Montoyas seem to be enough. I plan to sit in on the classes as often as
I can stand to share everyone's practice pains.

Dad has collected all his books from me this morning. All I have left
are my notes. I don't mind. Thanks to the garden thieves, people are
preparing themselves for the worst. I feel almost grateful to the
thieves.

They haven't come back, by the way---our thieves. When they do, we
should be able to give them something they don't expect.

Saturday, March 29, 2025

Our thieves paid us another visit last night.

Maybe they weren't the same ones, but their intentions were the same: To
take away what someone else has sweated to grow and very much needs.

This time they were after Richard Moss's rabbits. Those rabbits are the
neighborhood's only livestock except for some chickens the Cruz and
Montoya families tried to raise a few years ago. Those were stolen as
soon as they were old enough to make noise and let outsiders know they
were there. The Moss rabbits have been our secret until this year when
Richard Moss insisted on selling meat and whatever his wives could make
from raw or tanned rabbit hides out beyond the wall. The Mosses had been
selling to us all along, of course, meat, hides, fertilizer, everything
except live rabbits. Those he hoarded as breeding stock. But now,
stubborn, arrogant, and greedy, he had decided he could earn more if he
peddled his merchandise outside. So, now the word is out on the street
about the damned rabbits, and last night someone came to get them.

The Moss rabbit house is a converted three-car garage added to the
property in the 1980s according to Dad. It's hard to believe any
household once had three cars, and gas fueled cars at that. But I
remember the old garage before Richard Moss converted it. It was huge
with three black oil spots on the floor where three cars had once been
housed. Richard Moss repaired the walls and roof, put in windows for
cross ventilation, and in general, made the place almost fit for people
to live in. In fact, it's much better than what a lot of people live in
now on the outside. He built rows and tiers of cages---hutches---and put
in more electric lights and ceiling fans. The fans can be made to work
on kid power. He's hooked them up to an old bicycle frame, and every
Moss kid who's old enough to manage the pedals sooner or later gets
drafted into powering the fans. The Moss kids hate it, but they know
what they'll get if they don't do it.

I don't know how many rabbits the Mosses have now, but it seems they're
always killing and skinning and doing disgusting things to pelts. Even a
little monopoly is worth a lot of trouble.

The two thieves had managed to stuff 13 rabbits into canvas sacks by the
time our watchers spotted them. The watchers were Alejandro Montoya and
Julia Lincoln, one of Shani Yannis's sisters. Mrs. Montoya has two kids
sick with the flu so she's off the watch roster for a while.

Mrs. Lincoln and Mr. Montoya followed the plan that the group of
watchers had put together at their meetings. Without a word of command
or warning, they fired their guns into the air two or three times each,
at the same time, blowing their whistles full blast. They kept to cover,
but inside the Moss house, someone woke up and turned on the rabbit
house lights. That could have been a lethal mistake for the watchers,
but they were hidden behind pomegranate bushes.

The two thieves ran like rabbits.

Abandoning sacks, rabbits, pry bars, a long coil of rope, wire cutters,
and even an excellent long aluminum ladder, they scrambled up that
ladder and over the wall in seconds. Our wall is three meters high and
topped off with pieces of broken glass as well as the usual barbed wire
and the all but invisible Lazor wire. All the wire had been cut in spite
of our efforts. What a pity we couldn't afford to electrify it or set
other traps. But at least the glass---the oldest, simplest of our
tricks---had gotten one of them. We found a broad stream of dried blood
down the inside of the wall this morning.

We also found a Glock 19 pistol where one of the thieves had dropped it.
Mrs. Lincoln and Mr. Montoya could have been shot. If the thieves hadn't
been scared out of their minds, there could have been a gun battle.
Someone in the Moss house or a neighboring house could have been hurt or
killed.

Cory went after Dad about that once they were alone in the kitchen
tonight.

"I know," Dad said. He sounded tired and miserable. "Don't think we
haven't thought about those things. That's why we want to scare the
thieves away. Even shooting into the air isn't safe. Nothing's safe."

"They ran away this time, but they won't always run."

"I know."

"So what, then? You protect rabbits or oranges, and maybe get a child
killed?"

Silence.

*"We can't live this way!"* Cory shouted. I jumped. I've never heard her
sound like that before.

"We do live this way," Dad said. There was no anger in his voice, no
emotional response at all to her shouting. There was nothing. Weariness.
Sadness. I've never heard him sound so tired, so ... almost beaten. And
yet he had won. His idea had beaten off a pair of armed thieves without
our having to hurt anyone. If the thieves had hurt themselves, that was
their problem.

Of course they would come back, or others would come. That would happen
no matter what. And Cory was right. The next thieves might not lose
their guns and run away. So what? Should we lie in our beds and let them
take all we had and hope they were content with stripping our gardens?
How long does a thief stay content? And what's it like to starve?

"We couldn't make it without you," Cory was saying. She wasn't shouting
now. "That could have been you out there, facing criminals. Next time it
might be you. You could be shot, protecting the neighbors' rabbits."

"Did you notice," Dad said, "that every off-duty watcher answered the
whistles last night? They came out to defend their community."

"I don't care about them! It's you I'm worried about!"

"No," he said. "We can't think that way any more. Cory, there's nobody
to help us but God and ourselves. I protect Moss's place in spite of
what I think of him, and he protects mine, no matter what he thinks of
me. We all look out for one another." He paused. "I've got plenty of
insurance. You and the kids should be able to make it all right if---"

"No!" Cory said. "Do you think that's all it is? Money? Do you
think---?"

"No, Babe. No." Pause. "I know what it is to be left alone. This is no
world to be alone in."

There was a long silence, and I didn't think they would say any more. I
lay on my bed, wondering if I should get up and shut my door so I could
turn on my lamp and write. But there was a little more.

"What are we supposed to do if you die?" she demanded, and I think she
was crying. "What do we do if they shoot you over some damn rabbits?"

"Live!" Dad said. "That's all anybody can do right now. Live. Hold out.
Survive. I don't know whether good times are coming back again. But I
know that won't matter if we don't survive these times."

That was the end of their talk. I lay in the dark for a long time,
thinking about what they had said. Cory was right again. Dad might get
hurt. He might get killed. I don't know how to think about that. I can
write about it, but I don't feel it. On some deep level, I don't believe
it. I guess I'm as good at denial as anyone.

So Cory is right, but it doesn't matter. And Dad is right, but he
doesn't go far enough. God is Change, and in the end, God prevails. But
God exists to be shaped. It isn't enough for us to just survive, limping
along, playing business as usual while things get worse and worse. If
that's the shape we give to God, then someday we must become too
weak---too poor, too hungry, too sick---to defend ourselves. Then we'll
be wiped out.

There has to be more that we can do, a better destiny that we can shape.
Another place. Another way. Something!

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Saturday, April 26, 2025

S[OMETIMES NAMING A THING]{.small}---giving it a name or discovering its
name---helps one to begin to understand it. Knowing the name of a thing
*and* knowing what that thing is for gives me even more of a handle on
it.

The particular God-is-Change belief system that seems right to me will
be called Earthseed. I've tried to name it before. Failing that, I've
tried to leave it unnamed. Neither effort has made me comfortable. Name
plus purpose equals focus for me.

Well, today, I found the name, found it while I was weeding the back
garden and thinking about the way plants seed themselves, windborne,
animalborne, waterborne, far from their parent plants. They have no
ability at all to travel great distances under their own power, and yet,
they do travel. Even they don't have to just sit in one place and wait
to be wiped out. There are islands thousands of miles from
anywhere---the Hawaiian Islands, for example, and Easter Island---where
plants seeded themselves and grew long before any humans arrived.

Earthseed.

I am Earthseed. Anyone can be. Someday, I think there will be a lot of
us. And I think we'll have to seed ourselves farther and farther from
this dying place.

I've never felt that I was making any of this up---not the name,
Earthseed, not any of it. I mean, I've never felt that it was anything
other than real: discovery rather than invention, exploration rather
than creation. I wish I could believe it was all supernatural, and that
I'm getting messages from God. But then, I don't believe in that kind of
God. All I do is observe and take notes, trying to put things down in
ways that are as powerful, as simple, and as direct as I feel them. I
can never do that. I keep trying, but I can't. I'm not good enough as a
writer or poet or whatever it is I need to be. I don't know what to do
about that. It drives me frantic sometimes. I'm getting better, but so
slowly.

The thing is, even with my writing problems, every time I understand a
little more, I wonder why it's taken me so long---why there was ever a
time when I didn't understand a thing so obvious and real and true.

Here's the only puzzle in it all, the only paradox, or bit of illogic or
circular reasoning or whatever it should be called:

*Why is the universe?*

*To shape God.*

*Why is God?*

*To shape the universe.*

I can't get rid of it. I've tried to change it or dump it, but I can't.
I *cannot.* It feels like the truest thing I've ever written. It's as
mysterious and as obvious as any other explanation of God or the
universe that I've ever read, except that to me the others feel
inadequate, at best.

All the rest of Earthseed is explanation---what God is, what God does,
what we are, what we should do, what we can't help doing. ... Consider:
Whether you're a human being, an insect, a microbe, or a stone, this
verse is true.

*All that you touch,*

*You Change.*

*All that you Change,*

*Changes you.*

*The only lasting truth*

*Is Change.*

*God*

*Is Change.*

I'm going to go through my old journals and gather the verses I've
written into one volume. I'll put them into one of the exercise
notebooks that Cory hands out to the older kids now that there are so
few computers in the neighborhood. I've written plenty of useless stuff
in those books, getting my high school work out of the way. Now I'll put
one to better use. Then, someday when people are able to pay more
attention to what I say than to how old I am, I'll use these verses to
pry them loose from the rotting past, and maybe push them into saving
themselves and building a future that makes sense.

That's if everything will just hold together for a few more years.

Saturday, June 7, 2025

I've finally assembled a small survival pack for myself---a grab-and-run
pack. I've had to dig some things I need out of the garage and the attic
so that no one complains about my taking things they need. I've
collected a hatchet, for instance, and two small, light, all-metal pots.
There's plenty of stuff like that around because no one throws anything
away that has any possibility of someday being useful or salable.

I packed my few hundred dollars in savings---almost a thousand. It
*might* feed me for two weeks if I'm allowed to keep it, and if I'm very
careful what I buy and where I buy it. I've kept up with, prices,
questioning Dad when he and the other neighborhood men do the essential
shopping. Food prices are insane, always going up, never down. Everyone
complains about them.

I found an old canteen and a plastic bottle both for water, and I
resolved to keep them clean and full. I packed matches, a full change of
clothing, including shoes in case I have to get up at night and run,
comb, soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, tampons, toilet paper, bandages,
pins, needles and thread, alcohol, aspirin, a couple of spoons and
forks, a can opener, my pocket knife, packets of acorn flour, dried
fruit, roasted nuts and edible seeds, dried milk, a little sugar and
salt, my survival notes, several plastic storage bags, large and small,
a lot of plantable raw seed, my journal, my Earthseed notebook, and
lengths of clothesline. I stowed all this in a pair of old pillow cases,
one inside the other for strength. I rolled the pillowcases into a
blanket pack and tied it with some of the clothesline so that I could
grab it and run without losing things, but I made it easy to open at the
top so that I could get my journal in and out, change the water to keep
it fresh, and less often, change the food and check on the seed. The
last thing I wanted to find out was that instead of carrying plantable
seed or edible food, I had a load of bugs and worms.

I wish I could take a gun. I don't own one and Dad won't let me keep one
of his in my room. I mean to try to grab one if trouble comes, but I may
not be able to. It would be crazy to wind up outside with nothing but a
knife and a scared look, but it could happen. Dad and Wyatt Talcott took
us out for target practice today, and afterward I tried to talk Dad into
letting me keep one of the guns in my room.

"No," he said, sitting down, tired and dusty, behind his desk in his
cluttered office. "You don't have anywhere to keep it safe during the
day, and the boys are always in and out of your room."

I hesitated, then told him about the emergency pack that I had put
together.

He nodded. "I thought it was a good idea back when you first suggested
it," he said. "But, think, Lauren. It would be like a gift to a burglar.
Money, food, water, a gun. ... Most burglars don't find what they want
all bundled up and waiting for them. I think we'd better make it a
little harder for any burglar who comes here to get hold of a gun."

"It will just be a rolled up blanket mixed in with some other rolled or
folded bed clothes in my closet," I said. "No one will even notice it."

"No." He shook his head. "No, the guns stay where they are."

And that's that. I think he's more worried about the boys snooping
around than about burglars. My brothers have been taught how to behave
around guns all their lives, but Greg is only eight and Ben is nine. Dad
just isn't ready to put temptation in their paths yet. Marcus at 11 is
more trustworthy than a lot of adults, but Keith at almost 13 is a
question mark. He wouldn't steal from Dad. He wouldn't dare. But he has
stolen from me---only little things so far. He wants a gun, though, the
way thirsty people want water. He wants to be all grown up---yesterday.
So maybe Dad's right. I hate his decision, but maybe he's right.

"Where would you go?" I asked him, changing the subject. "If we were
forced out of here, where would you take us?"

He blew out a breath, puffing up his cheeks for a second. "To the
neighbors or to the college," he said. "The college has temporary
emergency accommodations for employees who are burned or driven out of
their homes."

"And then?"

"Rebuilding, fortifying, doing whatever we can do to live and be safe."

"Would you ever think about leaving here, heading north to where water
isn't such a problem and food is cheaper?"

"No." He stared into space. "My job down here is as secure as a job can
be. There are no jobs up there. Newcomers work for food if they work at
all. Experience doesn't matter. Education doesn't matter. There are just
too many desperate people. They work their lives away for a sack of
beans and they live on the streets."

"I heard it was easier up there," I said. "Oregon, Washington, Canada."

"Closed," he said. "You've got to sneak into Oregon if you get in at
all. Even harder to sneak into Washington. People get shot every day
trying to sneak into Canada. Nobody wants California trash."

"But people do leave. People are always moving north."

"They try. They're desperate and they have nothing to lose. But I do.
This is my home. Beyond taxes, I don't owe a penny on it. You and your
brothers have never known a hungry day here, and God willing, you never
will."

In my Earthseed notebook, I've written,

***A tree Cannot grow***

***In its parents' shadows.***

Is it necessary to write things like that? Everyone knows them. What do
they mean now, anyway? What does this one mean if you live in a
cul-de-sac with a wall around it? What does it mean if you're damned
lucky to live in a cul-de-sac with a wall around it?

There was a long report on the radio today about the findings of the big
Anglo-Japanese cosmological station on the moon. The station, with its
vast array of telescopes and some of the most sensitive spectroscopic
equipment ever made has detected more planets orbiting nearby stars.
That station has been detecting new worlds for a dozen years now, and
there's even evidence that a few of the discovered worlds may be
life-bearing. I've listened to and read every scrap of information I
could find on this subject, and I've noticed that there's less and less
argument against the likelihood that some of these worlds are alive. The
idea is gaining scientific acceptance. Of course, no one has any idea
whether the extrasolar life is anything more than a few trillion
microbes. People speculate about intelligent life, and it's fun to think
about, but no one is claiming to have found anyone to talk to out there.
I don't care. Life alone is enough. I find it ... more exciting and
encouraging than I can explain, more important than I can explain. There
*is* life out there. There are living worlds just a few light years
away, and the United States is busy drawing back from even our nearby
dead worlds, the moon and Mars. I understand why they are, but I wish
they weren't.

I suspect that a living world might be easier for us to adapt to and
live on without a long, expensive umbilical to Earth. *Easier* but not
easy. Still, that's something, because I don't think there could be a
multi-light-year umbilical. I think people who traveled to extrasolar
worlds would be on their own---far from politicians and business people,
failing economies and tortured ecologies---and far from help. Well out
of the shadow of their parent world.

Tomorrow, I'll be sixteen. Only sixteen. I feel older. I want to be
older. I need to be older. I hate being a kid. Time drags!

Tracy Dunn has disappeared. She's been depressed since Amy was killed.
When she talked at all, it was about dying and wanting to die and
deserving to die. Everyone kept hoping she would get over her grief---or
her guilt---and get on with her life. Maybe she couldn't. Dad talked
with her several times, and I know he was worried about her. Her crazy
family hasn't been any help. They treat her the way she treated Amy:
They ignore her.

The rumor is that she went outside sometime yesterday. A group of Moss
and Payne kids say they saw her go out of the gate just after they left
school. No one has seen her since.

Sunday, July 20, 2025

Here's the birthday gift that came into my mind this morning as I woke
up---just two lines:

***The Destiny of Earthseed***

***Is to take root among the stars.***

This is what I was reaching for a few days ago when the story of the new
planets being discovered caught my attention. It's true, of course. It's
obvious.

Right now, it's also impossible. The world is in horrible shape. Even
rich countries aren't doing as well as history says rich countries used
to do. President Donner isn't the only one breaking up and selling off
science and space projects. No one is expanding the kind of exploration
that doesn't earn an immediate profit, or at least promise big future
profits. There's no mood now for doing anything that could be considered
unnecessary or wasteful. And yet,

***The Destiny of Earthseed***

***Is to take root among the stars.***

I don't know how it will happen or when it will happen. There's so much
to do before it can even begin. I guess that's to be expected. There's
always a lot to do before you get to go to heaven.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Saturday, July 26, 2025

T[RACY DUNN HAS NOT]{.small} come home and has not been found by the
police. I don't think she will be. She's only been gone for a week, but
a week outside must be like a week in hell. People vanish outside. They
go through our gate like Mr. Yannis did, and everyone waits for them,
but they never come back---or they come back in an urn. I think Tracy
Dunn is dead.

Bianca Montoya is pregnant. It isn't just gossip, it's true, and it
matters to me, somehow. Bianca is 17, unmarried, and out of her mind
about Jorge Iturbe who lives at the Ibarra house and is Yolanda Ibarra's
brother.

Jorge admits to being the father. I don't know why they didn't just get
married before everything got so public. Jorge is 23, and he, at least,
ought to have some sense. Anyway, they're going to get married now. The
Ibarra and Iturbe families have been feuding with the Montoyas for a
week over this. So stupid. You'd think they had nothing else to do. At
least they're both Latino. No interracial feud this time. Last year when
Craig Dunn who's white and one of the saner members of the Dunn family
was caught making love to Siti Moss who's black and Richard Moss's
oldest daughter to boot, I thought someone was going to get killed.
Crazy.

But my point isn't who's sleeping with whom or who's feuding. My point
is---my question is---how in the world can anyone get married and make
babies with things the way they are now?

I mean, I know people have always gotten married and had kids, but now.
... Now there's nowhere to go, nothing to do. A couple gets married, and
if they're lucky, they get a room or a garage to live in---with no hope
of anything better and every reason to expect things to get worse.

Bianca's chosen life is one of my options. It's not one that I intend to
exercise, but it is pretty much what the neighborhood expects of me---of
anyone my age. Grow up a little more, get married, have babies. Curtis
Talcott says the new Iturbe family will get half-a-garage to live in
after they marry. Jorge's sister Celia Iturbe Cruz and her husband and
baby have the other half. Two couples, and not one paying job among
them. The best they could hope for would be to move into some rich
people's compound as domestic servants and work for room and board.
There's no way to save any money or ever do any better.

And what if they wanted to go north, try for a better life in Oregon or
Washington or Canada? It would be much harder to travel with a baby or
two, and much more dangerous to try to sneak past hostile guards and
over state lines or international borders with babies.

I don't know whether Bianca is brave or stupid. She and her sister are
busy altering their mother's old wedding dress, and everyone's cooking
and getting ready for a party as though these were the good old days.
*How can they?*

I like Curtis Talcott a lot. Maybe I love him. Sometimes I think I do.
He says he loves me. But if all I had to look forward to was marriage to
him and babies and poverty that just keeps getting worse, I think I'd
kill myself.

Saturday, August 2, 2025

We had a target practice today, and for the first time since I killed
the dog, we found another corpse. We all saw it this time---an old
woman, naked, maggoty, half-eaten, and beyond disgusting.

That did it for Aura Moss. She says she won't do any more target
shooting. Not ever. I tried talking to her, but she says it's the men's
job to protect us anyway. She says women shouldn't have to practice with
guns.

"What if you have to protect your younger sisters and brothers?" I asked
her. She has to babysit them often enough.

"I already know enough to do that," she said.

"You get rusty without practice," I said.

"I'm not going out again," she insisted. "It's none of your business. I
don't have to go!"

I couldn't move her. She was afraid, and that made her defensive. Dad
said I should have waited until the memory of the corpse faded, then
tried to convince her. He's right, I guess. It's the Moss attitude that
gets me. Richard Moss lets his wives and daughters pull things like
this. He works them like slaves in his gardens and rabbit raising
operation and around the house, but he lets them pretend they're
"ladies" when it comes to any community effort. If they don't want to do
their part, he always backs them up. This is dangerous and stupid. It's
a breeding ground for resentment. No Moss woman has ever stood a watch.
I'm not the only one who's noticed.

The two oldest Payne kids went with us for the first time. Bad luck for
them. They weren't scared off, though. Doyle and Margaret. There's a
toughness to them. They're all right. Their uncle Wardell Parrish hadn't
wanted them to go. He had made nasty comments about Dad's ego, about
private armies and vigilantes, and about his taxes---how he had paid
enough in his life to have a right to depend on the police to protect
him. Blah, blah, blah. He's a strange, solitary, whiny man. I've heard
that he used to be wealthy. Dad agrees with me that he can't be trusted.
But he's not Doyle and Margaret's father, and their mother Rosalee Payne
doesn't like anyone telling her how to raise her five kids. The only
power she has in the world is her authority over her children and her
money. She does have a little money, inherited from her parents. Her
brother has somehow lost his. So his trying to tell her what to do or
what she shouldn't let her kids do was a dumb move. He should have known
better---though for the kids' sake, I'm glad he didn't.

My brother Keith begged to go with us as usual. He'll turn thirteen in a
few days---August 14---and the thought of waiting two more years until
he's 15 must seem impossible to him. I understand that. Waiting is
terrible. Waiting to be older is worse than other kinds of waiting
because there's nothing you can do to make it happen faster. Poor Keith.
Poor me.

At least Dad lets Keith shoot at birds and squirrels with the family BB
gun, but Keith still complains. "It's not fair," he said today for the
twentieth or thirtieth time. "Lauren's a girl and you let her go. You
always let her do things. I could learn to help you guard and scare off
robbers. ..." He had once made the mistake of offering to help "shoot
robbers" instead of scaring them off, and Dad all but preached him a
sermon. Dad almost never hits us, but he can be scary without lifting a
finger.

Keith didn't go today, of course. And our practice went all right until
we found the corpse. We didn't see any dogs this time. Most upsetting to
me, though, there were a few more rag, stick, cardboard, and palm frond
shacks along the way into the hills along River Street. There always
seem to be more. They've never bothered us beyond begging and cursing,
but they always stare so. It gets harder to ride past them. They're
living skeletons, some of them. Skin and bones and a few teeth. They eat
whatever they can find up there.

Sometimes I dream about the way they stare at us.

Back at home, my brother Keith slipped out of the neighborhood---out
through the front gates and away. He stole Cory's key and took off on
his own. Dad and I didn't know until we got home. Keith was still gone,
and by then Cory knew he must be outside. She had checked with others in
the neighborhood and two of the Dunn kids, twins Allison and Marie, age
six, said they saw him go out the gate. That was when Cory went home and
discovered that her key was gone.

Dad, tired and angry and scared, was going to go right back out to look
for him, but Keith got home just as Dad was leaving. Cory, Marcus, and I
had gone to the front porch with Dad, all three of us speculating about
where Keith had gone, and Marcus and I volunteering to go with Dad to
help search. It was almost dark.

"You get back in that house and stay there," Dad said. "It's bad enough
to have one of you out there." He checked the submachine gun, made sure
it was fully loaded.

"Dad, look," I said. I had spotted something moving three houses
down---quick, shadowy movement alongside the Garfield porch. I didn't
know it was Keith. I was attracted by its furtiveness. Someone was
sneaking around, trying to hide.

Dad was quick enough to see the movement before it was hidden by the
Garfield house. He got up at once, took the gun, and went to check. The
rest of us watched and waited.

Moments later Cory said she heard an odd noise in the house. I was too
focused on Dad and what was going on outside to hear what she heard, or
to pay any attention to her. She went in. Marcus and I were still on the
porch when she screamed.

Marcus and I glanced at each other, then at the front door. Marcus
lunged for the door. I yelled for Dad. Dad was out of sight, but I heard
him answer my call.

"Come quick," I shouted, then I ran into the house.

Cory, Marcus, Bennett, and Gregory were in the kitchen, clustered around
Keith. Keith was sprawled, panting, on the floor, wearing only his
underpants. He was scraped and bruised, bleeding, and filthy. Cory knelt
beside him, examining him, questioning him, crying.

"What happened to you? Who did this? Why did you go outside? Where are
your clothes? What---?"

"Where's the key you stole?" Dad cut in. "Did they take it from you?"

Everyone jumped, looked up at Dad, then down at Keith.

"I couldn't help it," Keith said, still panting. "I couldn't, Daddy.
There were five guys."

"So they got the key."

Keith nodded, careful not to meet Dad's eyes.

Dad turned and strode out of the house, almost at a run. It was too late
now to get George or Brian Hsu to change the gate lock. That would have
to be done tomorrow, and new keys made and passed out. I thought Dad
must be going out to warn people and to put more watchers on duty. I
wanted to offer to help alert people, but I didn't. Dad looked too angry
to accept help from one of his kids right then. And when he got back,
Keith was in for it. Was he ever in for it. A pair of pants gone, and a
shirt and *a pair of shoes.* Cory had never been willing to let us run
around barefoot the way a lot of kids did, except in the house. Her
definitions of being civilized did not involve dirty, heavily callused
feet any more than they involved dirty, diseased skin. Shoes were
expensive, and we were always growing out of ours, but Cory insisted.
Each of us had at least one pair of wearable shoes, in spite of what
they cost, and they cost a lot. Now money would have to be found to get
an extra pair for Keith.

Keith curled up on the floor, smudging the tile with blood from his nose
and mouth, hugging himself and crying now that Dad was gone. It took
Cory two or three minutes to get him up and half carry him to the
bathroom. I tried to help her, but she stared at me like I was the one
who beat him up, so I let them alone. It wasn't as though I wanted to
help. I just thought I should. Keith was in real pain, and it was hard
for me to endure sharing it.

I cleaned up the blood so no one would slip in it or track it around.
Then I fixed dinner, ate, fed the three younger boys, and put the rest
aside for Dad, Cory, and Keith.

Sunday, August 3, 2025

Keith had to confess what he had done this morning at church. He had to
stand up in front of the whole congregation and tell them everything,
including what the five thugs had done to him. Then he had to
apologize---to God, to his parents, and to the congregation that he had
endangered and inconvenienced. Dad made him do that over Cory's
objections.

Dad never hit him, though last night he must have been tempted. "Why
would you do such a thing!" he kept demanding. "How could any son of
mine be so stupid! Where are your brains, boy? What did you think you
were doing? I'm talking to you! Answer me!"

Keith answered and answered and answered, but the answers never seemed
to make much sense to Dad. "I ain't no baby no more," he wept. Or, "I
wanted to show you. Just wanted to show you! You always let Lauren do
stuff!" Or, "I'm a man! I shouldn't be hiding in the house, hiding in
the wall; I'm a man!"

It went on and on because Keith refused to admit he had done anything
wrong. He wanted to show he was a man, not a scared girl. It wasn't his
fault that a gang of guys jumped him, beat him, robbed him. He didn't do
anything. It wasn't his fault.

Dad stared at him in utter disgust. "You disobeyed," he said. "You
stole. You endangered the lives and the property of everyone here,
including your mother, your sister, and your little brothers. If you
were the man you think you are, I'd beat the hell out of you!"

Keith stared straight ahead. "Bad guys come in even if they don't have a
key," he muttered. "They come in and steal stuff. It's not my fault!"

It took Dad two hours to get Keith to admit that it was his fault, no
excuses. He'd done wrong. He wouldn't do it again.

My brother isn't very smart, but he makes up for it in pure
stubbornness. My father is smart and stubborn. Keith didn't have a
chance, but he made Dad work for his victory. The next morning, Dad had
his revenge. I don't believe he thought of Keith's forced confession
that way, but Keith's expression told me that he did.

"How do I get out of this family," Marcus muttered to me as we watched.
I sympathized. He had to share a room with Keith, and the two of them,
only a year apart in age, fought all the time. Now things would be
worse.

Keith is Cory's favorite. If you asked her, she would say she didn't
have a favorite, but she does. She babies him and lets him get away with
skipping chores, a little lying, a little stealing. ... Maybe that's why
Keith thinks when he screws up, it's okay.

This morning's sermon was on the ten commandments with extra emphasis on
"Honor thy father and thy mother," and "Thou shalt not steal." I think
Dad got rid of a lot of anger and frustration, preaching that sermon.
Keith, tall, stone-faced, looking older than his thirteen years, kept
his anger. I could see him keeping it inside, holding it down, choking
on it.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Sunday, August 17, 2025

M[Y PARENTS' USUAL GOOD]{.small} judgment failed them this week on my
brother Keith's birthday. They gave him his own BB gun. It wasn't new,
but it worked, and it looked much more dangerous than it was. And it was
his. He didn't have to share it. I suppose it was intended to make him
feel better about the two years he still, had to wait until he got his
hands on the Smith & Wesson, or better yet, the Heckler & Koch. And, of
course, it was supposed to help him get over his stupid desire to sneak
out, and the humiliation of his public confession.

Keith shot a few more pigeons and crows, threatened to shoot
Marcus---Marcus just told me about that tonight---then yesterday, he
took off for parts unknown. He took the BB gun with him, of course. No
one has seen him for about eighteen hours, and there's not much doubt
that he's gone outside again.

Monday, August 18, 2025

Dad went out looking for Keith today. He even called in the police. He
says he doesn't know how we'll afford the fee, but he's scared. The
longer Keith is gone, the more likely he is to get hurt or killed.
Marcus says he thinks Keith went looking for the guys who beat him up. I
don't believe it. Not even Keith would go looking for five guys---or
even one guy---with nothing but a BB gun.

Cory's even more upset than Dad. She's scared and jumpy and sick to her
stomach, and she keeps crying. I talked her into going back to bed, then
taught her classes myself. I've done that four or five times before when
she was sick, so it wasn't too weird for the kids. I just used Cory's
lesson plans, and during the first part of the day, I partnered the
older kids with my kindergartners and let everyone get a taste of
teaching or learning from someone different. Some of my students are my
age and older, and a couple of these---Aura Moss and Michael
Talcott---got up and left. They knew I understood the work. I got the
last of my high school work and tests out of the way almost two years
ago. Since then I've done uncredited (free) college work with Dad.
Michael and Aura know all that, but they're much too grown up to learn
anything from the likes of me. The hell with them. It's a pity, though,
that my Curtis has to have a brother like Michael---not that any of us
gets to choose our brothers.

Tuesday, August 19, 2025

No sign of Keith. I think Cory has gone into mourning for him. I handled
classes again today, and Dad went out searching again. He came home
looking exhausted tonight, and Cory wept and shouted at him.

"You didn't try!" she said with me and all three of my brothers looking
on. We'd all come to see whether Dad had brought Keith back. "You could
have found him if you'd tried!"

Dad tried to go to her, but she backed away, still shouting: "If it were
your precious Lauren out there alone, you would have found her by now!
You don't care about Keith."

She's never said anything like that before.

I mean, we were always Cory and Lauren. She never asked me to call her
"mother," and I never thought to do it. I always knew she was my
stepmother. But still ... I always loved her. It mystified me that Keith
was her favorite, but it didn't make me love her any less. I was her
kid, but not her kid. Not quite. Not really. But I always thought she
loved me.

Dad shooed us all off to bed. He quieted Cory and took her back to their
room. A few minutes ago, he came to see me.

"She didn't mean it," he said. "She loves you as though you were her
daughter, Lauren."

I just looked at him.

"She wants you to know she's sorry."

I nodded, and after a few more assurances, he went.

Is she sorry? I don't think so.

Did she mean it. She did. Oh, yes, she meant it. Shit.

Thursday, August 30, 2025

Keith came back last night.

He just walked into the house during dinner, as though he'd been outside
playing football instead of gone since Saturday. And this time he looked
fine. Not a mark on him. He was wearing a clean new set of
clothing---even new shoes. All of it was of much better quality than he
had when he left, and much more expensive than we could have afforded.

He still had the BB gun until Dad took it away from him and smashed it.

Keith wouldn't say where he'd been or how he'd gotten the new things, so
Dad beat him bloody.

I've only seen Dad like that once before---when I was 12. Cory tried to
stop him, tried to pull him off Keith, screamed at him in English, then
in Spanish, then without words.

Gregory threw up on the floor, and Bennett started to cry. Marcus backed
away from the whole scene, and slipped out of the house.

Then it was over.

Keith was crying like a two-year-old and Cory was holding him. Dad stood
over both of them, looking dazed.

I followed Marcus out the back door and stumbled and almost fell down
the back steps. I didn't know what I was doing. Marcus wasn't around. I
sat on the steps in the warm darkness and let my body shake and hurt and
vomit in helpless empathy with Keith. Then I guess I passed out.

I came to sometime later with Marcus shaking me and whispering my name.

I got up with Marcus hanging on to my arm, trying to steady me, and I
got to my bedroom.

"Let me sleep in here," he whispered once I was sitting on my bed, dazed
and still in pain. "I'll sleep on the floor, I don't care."

"All right," I said, not caring where he slept. I lay down on the bed
without taking off even my shoes, and drew my body into a fetal ball on
top of the bedclothes. I either fell asleep that way or I passed out
again.

Saturday, October 25, 2025

Keith has gone outside again. He went yesterday afternoon. Cory didn't
admit until tonight that he took not only her key this time, but her
gun. He took the Smith & Wesson.

Dad refused to go out and look for him. Dad slept in his office last
night. He's sleeping there again tonight.

I never liked my brother much. I hate him now for what he's doing to the
family---for what he's doing to my father. I hate him. Damn, I hate him.

Monday, November 3, 2025

Keith came home tonight while Dad was visiting over at the Talcott
house. I suspect that Keith hung around and watched the house and waited
until Dad left. He had come to see Cory. He brought her a lot of money
done up in a fat roll.

She stared at it, then took it, dazed. "So much, Keith," she whispered.
"Where did you get it?"

"It's for you," he said. "All for you, not him."

He took her hand and closed it around the money---and she let him do it,
though she had to know it must be stolen money or drug money or worse.

Keith gave Bennett and Gregory big, expensive bars of milk chocolate
with peanuts. He just smiled at Marcus and me---an obvious "fuck you"
smile. Then, before Dad could come home and find him here, he left
again. Cory hadn't realized that he was leaving again, and she all but
screamed and clung to him.

"No! You'll be killed out there! What's the matter with you? Stay home!"

"Mama, I won't let him beat me again," he said. "I don't need him
hitting me and telling me what to do. Pretty soon, I'll be able to make
more money in a day than he can in a week---maybe in a month."

"You'll be killed!"

"No I won't. I know what I'm doing." He kissed her, then, with
surprising ease, took her arms from around him. "I'll come back and see
you," he said. "I'll bring you presents."

And he vanished out the back door, and was gone.

C[IVILIZATION IS TO GROUPS]{.small} what intelligence is to individuals.
It is a means of combining the intelligence of many to achieve ongoing
group adaptation.

Civilization, like intelligence, may serve well, serve adequately, or
fail to serve its adaptive function. When civilization fails to serve,
it must disintegrate unless it is acted upon by unifying internal or
external forces.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Thursday, June 25, 2026

K[EITH CAME HOME YESTERDAY,]{.small} bigger than ever, as tall and lean
as Dad is tall and broad. He's not quite 14, but he already looks like
the man he wants so much to be. We're like that, we Olaminas---tall,
sturdy, fast growing people. Except for Gregory who is only nine, we all
tower over Cory. I'm still the tallest, but my height seems to annoy her
these days. She loves Keith's size, though---her big son. She just hates
the fact that he doesn't live with us anymore.

"I got a room," he said to me yesterday. We talked, he and I. Cory was
with Dorotea Cruz who is one of her best friends and who had just had
another baby. The other boys were playing in the street and on the
island. Dad had gone to the college, and would be gone overnight. Now,
more than ever, it's safest to go out just at dawn, and not to try
coming home until just at dawn the next morning. That's if you have to
go outside at all, which Dad does about once a week. The worst parasites
still prowl at night and sleep late into the morning. Yet Keith lives
outside.

"I got a room in a building with some other people," he said.
Translation: He and his friends were squatting in an abandoned building.
Who were his friends? A gang? A flock of prostitutes? A bunch of
*astronauts,* flying high on drugs? A den of thieves? All of the above?
Whenever he came to see us he brought money to Cory and little gifts to
Bennett and Gregory.

How could he get money? There's no honest way.

"Do your friends know how old you are?" I asked.

He grinned. "Hell, no. Why should I tell them that?"

I nodded. "It does help to look older sometimes. You want something to
eat?"

"You going to cook for me?"

"I've cooked for you hundreds of times. Thousands."

"I know. But you always had to before."

"Don't be stupid. You think I couldn't act the way you did: Skip out on
my responsibilities if I felt like it? I don't feel like it. You want to
eat or not?"

"Sure."

I made rabbit stew and acorn bread---enough for Cory and all the boys
when they came in. He hung around and watched me work for a while, then
began to talk to me. He's never done that before. We've never, never
liked each other, he and I. But he had information I wanted, and he
seemed to want to talk. I must have been the safest person he could talk
to. He wasn't afraid of shocking me. He didn't much care what I thought.
And he wasn't afraid I'd tell Dad or Cory anything he said. Of course, I
wouldn't. Why cause them pain? I've never been much for tattling on
people, anyway.

"It's just a nasty old building on the outside," he was saying of his
new home. "You wouldn't believe how great it looks once you go in,
though."

"Whorehouse or spaceship?" I asked.

"It's got stuff like you never saw," he evaded. "TV windows you go
through instead of just sitting and looking at. Headsets, belts, and
touchrings ... you see and feel everything, do anything. Anything!
There's places and things you can get into with that equipment that are
insane! You don't ever have to go into the street except to get food."

"And whoever owns this stuff took you in?" I asked.

"Yeah."

"Why?"

He looked at me for a long time, then started to laugh. "Because I can
read and write," he said at last. "And none of them can. They're all
older than me, but not one of them can read or write anything. They
stole all this great stuff and they couldn't even use it. Before I got
there they even broke some of it because they couldn't read the
instructions."

Cory and I had had a hell of a struggle, teaching him to read and write.
He had been bored, impatient, anything but eager.

"So you read for a living---help your new friends learn to use their
stolen equipment," I said.

"Yeah."

"And what else?"

"Nothin' else."

What a piss-poor liar he is. Always was. He's got no conscience. He just
isn't smart enough to tell convincing lies. "Drugs, Keith?" I asked.
"Prostitution? Robbery?"

"I said nothing else! You always think you know everything."

I sighed. "You're not done causing Dad and Cory pain are you? Not by a
long shot."

He looked as though he wanted to shout back at me or hit me. He might
have done one or the other if I hadn't mentioned Cory.

"I don't give a shit about him," he said, his voice low and ugly. He had
a man's voice already. He had everything but a man's brain. "I do more
for her than he does. I bring her money and nice things. And my friends
... my friends know she lives here, and they let this place alone. He's
nothing!"

I turned and looked at him and saw my father's face, lighter-skinned,
younger, thinner, but my father's face, unmistakable. "He's you," I
whispered. "Every time I look at you, I see him. Every time you look at
him, you see yourself."

"Dogshit!"

I shrugged.

It was a long time before he spoke again. At last he said, "Did he ever
hit you?"

"Not for about five years."

"Why'd he hit you---back then?"

I thought about that, and decided to tell him. He was old enough. "He
caught me and Rubin Quintanilla in the bushes together."

Keith shouted with abrupt laughter. "You and Rubin? Really? You were
doing it with him? You're kidding."

"We were twelve. What the hell."

"You're lucky you didn't get pregnant."

"I know. Twelve can be a dumb age."

He looked away. "Bet he didn't beat you as bad as he beat me!"

"He sent you boys over to play with the Talcotts." I gave him a glass of
cold orange juice and poured one for myself.

"I don't remember," he said.

"You were nine," I said. "Nobody was going to tell you what was going
on. As I remember, I told you I fell down the back steps."

He frowned, perhaps remembering. My face had been memorable. Dad hadn't
beaten me as badly as he beat Keith, but I looked worse. He should
remember that.

"He ever beat up Mama?"

I shook my head. "No. I've never seen any sign of it. I don't think he
would. He loves her, you know. He really does."

"Bastard!"

"He's our father, and he's the best man I know."

"Did you think that when he beat you?"

"No. But later when I figured out how stupid I'd been, I was just glad
he was so strict. And back when it happened, I was just glad he didn't
quite kill me."

He laughed again---twice in just a few minutes, and both times at things
I'd said. Maybe he was ready to open up a little now.

"Tell me about the outside," I said. "How do you live out there?"

He drained the last of his second glass of juice. "I told you. I live
real good out there."

"But how did you live when you first went out---when you went to stay."

He looked at me and smiled. He smiled like that years ago when he used
red ink to trick me into bleeding in empathy with a wound he didn't
have. I remember that particular nasty smile.

"You want to go out yourself, don't you?" he demanded.

"Someday."

"What, instead of marrying Curtis and having a bunch of babies?"

"Yeah. Instead of that."

"I wondered why you were being so nice to me."

The food smelled just about ready, so I got up and took the bread from
the oven and bowls from the cupboard. I was tempted to tell him to dish
up his own stew, but I knew he would spoon all the meat out of the stew
and leave nothing but potatoes and vegetables for the rest of us. So I
served him and myself, covered the pot, left it on the lowest possible
fire, and put a towel over the bread.

I let him eat in peace for a while, though I thought the boys would be
coming in any time now, starving.

Then I was afraid to wait any longer. "Talk to me, Keith," I said. "I
really want to know. How did you survive when you first went out there."

His smile this time was less evil. Maybe the food had mellowed him.
"Slept in a cardboard box for three days and stole food," he said. "I
don't know why I kept going back to that box. Could have slept in any
old corner. Some kids carry a piece of cardboard to sleep on---so they
won't be right down on the ground, you know.

"Then I got a sleepsack from an old man. It was new, like he never used
it. Then I---"

"You stole it?"

He gave me a look of scorn. "What you think I was going to do? I didn't
have no money. Just had that gun---Mama's .38."

Yes. He had brought it back to her three visits ago, along with two
boxes of ammunition. Of course he never said how he got the
ammunition---or how he got his replacement gun---a Heckler & Koch nine
millimeter just like Dad's. He just showed up with things and claimed
that if you had the money, you could buy anything outside. He had never
admitted how he got the money.

"Okay," I said. "So you stole a sleepsack. And you kept stealing food?
It's a wonder you didn't get caught."

"The old guy had some money. I used it to buy food. Then I started
walking toward L.A."

That old dream of his. For reasons that make sense to him alone, he's
always wanted to go to L.A. Any sane person would be thankful for the
twenty miles that separate us from that oozing sore.

"There's people all over the freeway coming away from LA.," he said.
"There's even people walking up from way down in San Diego. They don't
know where they're going. I talked to this guy, he said he was going to
Alaska. Goddamn. Alaska!"

"Good luck to him," I said. "He's got a lot of guns to face before he
gets there."

"He won't get there. Alaska must be a thousand miles from here!"

I nodded. "More than that, and with hostile state lines and borders
along the way. But good luck to him anyhow. It's a goal that makes
sense."

"He had twenty-three thousand dollars in his pack."

I didn't say anything. I just froze, stared at him in disgust and
renewed dislike. But of course. Of course.

"You wanted to know," he said. "That's what it's like outside. If you
got a gun, you're somebody. If you don't, you're shit. And a lot of
people out there don't have guns."

"I thought most of them did---except the ones too poor to be worth
robbing."

"I thought so too. But guns cost a lot. And it's easier to get one if
you already got one, you know?"

"What if that Alaska guy had had one. You'd be dead."

"I sneaked up on him while he was sleeping. Just sort of followed him
until he went off the road to go to sleep. Then I got him. He led me
away from L.A., though."

"You shot him?"

The nasty smile again.

"He talked to you. He was friendly to you. And you shot him."

"What was I supposed to do? Wait for God to come and give me some money?
What was I supposed to do?"

"Come home."

"Shit."

"Doesn't it even bother you that you took someone's life---you killed a
man?"

He seemed to think about that for a while. Then he shook his head. "It
don't bother me," he said. "I was scared at first, but then ... after I
did it, I didn't feel nothing. Nobody saw me do it. I just took his
stuff and left him there. Besides, maybe he wasn't dead. People don't
always die just because you shoot them."

"You didn't check?"

"I just wanted his stuff. He was crazy anyway. Alaska!"

I didn't say any more to him, didn't ask any more questions. He talked a
little about meeting some guys and joining up with them, then
discovering that even though they were all older than he was, none of
them could read or write. He was a help to them. He made their lives
pleasanter. Maybe that's why they didn't just wait until he was asleep
and kill him and take his loot for themselves.

After a while, he noticed that I wasn't saying anything, and he laughed.
"You better marry Curtis and make babies," he said. "Out there, outside,
you wouldn't last a day. That hyperempathy shit of yours would bring you
down even if nobody touched you."

"You think that," I said.

"Hey, I saw a guy get both of his eyes gouged out. After that, they set
him on fire and watched him run around and scream and burn. You think
you could stand to see that?"

"Your new friends did that?" I asked.

"Hell no! Crazies did that. Paints. They shave off all their hair---even
their eyebrows---and they paint their skin green or blue or red or
yellow. They eat fire and kill rich people."

"They do what?"

"They take that drug that makes them like to watch fires. Sometimes a
camp fire or a trash fire or a house fire. Or sometimes they grab a rich
guy and set him on fire."

*"Why?"*

"I don't know. They're crazy. I heard some of them used to be rich kids,
so I don't know why they hate rich people so much. That drug is bad,
though. Sometimes the paints like the fire so much they get too close to
it. Then their friends don't even help him. They just watch them burn.
It's like ... I don't know, it's like they were fucking the fire, and
like it was the best fuck they ever had."

"You've never tried it?"

"Hell no! I told you. Those guys are crazy. You know, even the girls
shave their heads. Damn, they look ugly!"

"They're mostly kids, then?"

"Yeah. Your age up to maybe twenty. There's a few old ones, twenty-five,
even thirty. I hear most of them don't live that long though."

Cory and the boys came in at that moment, Gregory and Bennett excited
because their side in soccer had won. Cory was happy and wistful,
talking to Marcus about Dorotea Cruz's new baby girl. Things changed
when they all saw Keith, of course, but the evening wasn't too bad.
Keith had presents for the little boys, of course, and money for Cory
and nothing for Marcus and me. This time, though, he was a little
shamefaced with me.

"Maybe I'll bring you something next time," he said.

"No, don't," I said, thinking of the Alaska-bound traveler. "It's all
right. I don't want anything."

He shrugged and turned to talk to Cory.

Monday, July 20, 2026

Keith came to see me today just before dark. He found me walking home
from the Talcott house where Curtis had been wishing me a very happy
birthday. We've been very careful, Curtis and I, but from somewhere or
other, he's gotten a supply of condoms. They're old fashioned, but they
work. And there's an unused darkroom in a corner of the Talcott garage.

Keith scared me out of a very sweet mood. He came from behind two houses
without making a sound. He had almost reached me before I realized
someone was there and turned to face him.

He raised his hands, smiling, "Brought you a birthday present," he said.
He put something into my left hand. Money.

"Keith, no, give it to Cory."

"You give it to her. You want her to have it, you give it to her. I gave
it to you."

I walked him to the gate, concerned that one of the watchers might spot
him and shoot him. He was that much taller than he had been when he
stopped living with us. Dad was home so he wouldn't come in. I thanked
him for the money and told him I would give it to Cory. I wanted him to
know that because I didn't want him to bring me anything else, ever.

He seemed not to mind. He kissed the side of my face said, "Happy
birthday," and went out. He still had Cory's key, and although Dad knew
he had it, he hadn't had the lock changed again.

Wednesday, August 26, 2026

Today, my parents had to go downtown to identify the body of my brother
Keith.

Saturday, August 29, 2026

I haven't been able to write a word since Wednesday. I don't know what
to write. The body was Keith's. I never saw it, of course. Dad said he
tried to keep Cory from seeing it. The things someone had done to Keith
before he died. ... I don't want to write about this, but I need to.
Sometimes writing about a thing makes it easier to stand.

Someone had cut and burned away most of my brothers skin. Everywhere
except his face. They burned out his eyes, but left the rest of his face
intact---like they wanted him to be recognized. They cut and they
cauterized and they cut and they cauterized. ... Some of the wounds were
days old. Someone had an endless hatred of my brother.

Dad got us all together and described to us what had been done. He told
it in a flat, dead monotone. He wanted to scare us, to scare Marcus,
Bennett, and Gregory in particular. He wanted us to understand just how
dangerous the outside is.

The police said drug dealers torture people the way Keith was tortured.
They torture people who steal from them and people who compete with
them. We don't know whether Keith was doing either of these things. We
just know he's dead. His body was dumped across town from here in front
of a burned-out old building that was once a nursing home. It was dumped
on the broken concrete and abandoned several hours after Keith died. It
could have been dumped in one of the canyons and only the dogs would
have found it. But someone wanted it to be found, wanted it to be
recognized. Had one of his victims' relatives or friends managed to get
even at last?

The police seemed to think we should know who killed him. I got the
feeling from their questions that they would have been happy to arrest
Dad or Cory or both of them. But they both lead very public lives, and
neither had any unexplained absences or other breaks in routine. Dozens
of people could give them alibis. Of course, I said nothing about what
Keith had told me he had been doing. What good would that do? He was
dead, and in a horrible way. By accident or by intent, all his victims
were avenged.

Wardell Parrish felt called upon to tell the police about the big fight
Dad and Keith had had last year. He'd heard it, of course. Half the
neighborhood had heard it. Family fights are neighborhood theater---and
Dad, the minister, after all!

I know Wardell Parrish was the one who told the cops. His youngest niece
Tanya let that much slip. "Uncle Ward said he hated to mention it but
..."

Oh, I'll bet he hated to mention it. Damned bastard! But nobody backed
him up. The cops went nosing around the neighborhood, but no one else
admitted knowing anything about a fight. After all, they knew Dad didn't
kill Keith. And they knew the cops liked to solve cases by "discovering"
evidence against whomever they decided must be guilty. Best to give them
nothing. They never helped when people called for help. They came later,
and more often than not, made a bad situation worse.

We had the service today. Dad asked his friend Reverend Robinson to take
care of it. Dad just sat with Cory and the rest of us and looked bent
and old. So old.

Cory cried all day, most of the time without making a sound. She's been
crying off and on since Wednesday. Marcus and Dad tried to comfort her.
Even I tried, though the way she looked at me ... as though I had had
something to do with Keith's death, as though she almost hated me. I
keep reaching out to her. I don't know what else to do. Maybe in time,
she'll be able to forgive me for not being her daughter, for being alive
when her son is dead, for being Dad's daughter by someone else ... ? I
don't know.

Dad never shed a tear. I've never seen him cry in my life. Today, I wish
he would. I wish he could.

Curtis Talcott sort of hung around with me today, and we talked and
talked. I guess I needed to talk, and Curtis was willing to put up with
me.

He said I should cry. He said no matter how bad things had gotten
between Keith and me or Keith and the family, I should let myself cry.
Odd. Until he brought it up, I hadn't thought about my own absence of
tears. I hadn't cried at all. Maybe Cory had noticed. Maybe my dry face
was just one more grudge she held against me.

It wasn't that I was holding back, being stoic. It's just that I hated
Keith at least as much as I loved him. He was my
brother---half-brother---but he was also the most sociopathic person
I've ever been close to. He would have been a monster if he had been
allowed to grow up. Maybe he was one already. He never cared what he
did. If he wanted to do something and it wouldn't cause him immediate
physical pain, he did it, fuck the earth.

He messed up our family, broke it into something less than a family.
Still, I would never have wished him dead. I would never wish anyone
dead in that horrible way. I think he was killed by monsters much worse
than himself. It's beyond me how one human being could do that to
another. If hyperempathy syndrome were a more common complaint, people
couldn't do such things. They could kill if they had to, and bear the
pain of it or be destroyed by it. But if everyone could feel everyone
else's pain, who would torture? Who would cause anyone unnecessary pain?
I've never thought of my problem as something that might do some good
before, but the way things are, I think it would help. I wish I could
give it to people. Failing that, I wish I could find other people who
have it, and live among them. A biological conscience is better than no
conscience at all.

But as for me crying, if I were going to cry, I think I would have done
it back when Dad beat Keith---when the beating was over and Dad saw what
he had done, and we all saw how both Keith and Cory looked at him. I
knew then that neither of them would ever forgive him. Not ever. That
was the end of something precious in the family.

I wish Dad could cry for his son, but I don't feel any need at all to
cry for my brother. May he rest in peace---in his urn, in heaven,
wherever.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Saturday, October 17, 2026

W[E ARE COMING APART]{.small}.

The community, the families, individual family members. ... We're a
rope, breaking, a single strand at a time.

There was another robbery last night---or an attempted robbery. I wish
that was all. No garden theft this time. Three guys came over the wall
and crowbarred their way into the Cruz house. The Cruz family, of
course, has loud burglar alarms, barred windows, and security gates at
all the doors just like the rest of us, but that doesn't seem to matter.
When people want to come in, they come in. The thieves used simple hand
tools---crowbars, hydraulic jacks, things anyone can get. I don't know
how they disabled the burglar alarm. I know they cut the electrical and
phone lines to the house. That shouldn't have mattered since the alarm
had back-up batteries. Whatever else they did, or whatever went wrong,
the alarm didn't go off. And after the thieves used the crowbar on the
door, they walked into the kitchen and used it on Dorotea Cruz's
seventy-five-year-old grandmother. The old lady was a light sleeper and
had gotten into the habit of getting up at night and brewing herself a
cup of lemon grass tea. Her family says that's what she was coming into
the kitchen to do when the thieves broke in.

Then Dorotea's brothers Hector and Rubin Quintanilla, came running, guns
in hand. They had the bedroom nearest to the kitchen and they heard all
the noise---the break-in itself and Mrs. Quintanilla being knocked
against the kitchen table and chairs. They killed two of the thieves.
The third got away, perhaps wounded. There was a lot of blood. But old
Mrs. Quintanilla was dead.

This is the seventh incident since Keith was killed. More and more
people are coming over our wall to take what we have, or what they think
we have. Seven intrusions into house or garden in less than two months
in an 11-household community. If this is what's happening to us, what
must it be like for people who are really rich---although perhaps with
their big guns, private armies of security guards, and up to date
security equipment, they're better able to fight back. Maybe that's why
we're getting so much attention. We have a few stealables and we're not
that well protected. Of the seven intrusions, three were successful.
Thieves got in and out with something---a couple of radios, a sack of
walnuts, wheat flour, corn meal, pieces of jewelry, an ancient TV, a
computer ... If they could carry it, they made off with it. If what
Keith told me is true, we're getting the poorer class of thieves here.
No doubt the tougher, smarter, more courageous thieves hit stores and
businesses. But our lower-class thugs are killing us slowly.

Next year, I'll be 18---old enough, according to Dad, to stand a regular
night watch. I wish I could do it now. As soon as I can do it, I will.
But it won't be enough.

It's funny. Cory and Dad have been using some of the money Keith brought
us to help the people who've been robbed. Stolen money to help victims
of theft. Half the money is hidden in our back yard in case of disaster.
There has always been some money hidden out there. Now there's enough to
make a difference. The other half has gone into the church fund to help
our neighbors in emergencies. It won't be enough.

Tuesday, October 20, 2026

Something new is beginning---or perhaps something old and nasty is
reviving. A company called Kagimoto, Stamm, Frampton, and
Company---KSF---has taken over the running of a small coastal city
called Olivar. Olivar, incorporated in the 1980s, is just one more
beach/bedroom suburb of Los Angeles, small and well-to-do. It has little
industry, much hilly, vacant land and a short, crumbling coastline. Its
people, like some here in our Robledo neighborhood, earn salaries that
would once have made them prosperous and comfortable. In fact, Olivar is
a lot richer than we are, but since it's a coastal city, its taxes are
higher, and since some of its land is unstable, it has extra problems.
Parts of it sometimes crumble into the ocean, undercut or deeply
saturated by salt water. Sea level keeps rising with the warming climate
and there is the occasional earthquake. Olivar's flat, sandy beach is
already just a memory. So are the houses and businesses that used to sit
on that beach. Like coastal cities all over the world, Olivar needs
special help. It's an upper middle class, white, literate community of
people who once had a lot of weight to throw around. Now, not even the
politicians it's helped to elect will stand by it. The whole state, the
country, the world needs help, it's been told. What the hell is tiny
Olivar whining about?

Somewhat richer and less geologically active communities are getting
help---dikes, sea walls, evacuation assistance, whatever's appropriate.
Olivar, located between the sea and Los Angeles, is getting an influx of
salt water from one direction and desperate poor people from the other.
It has a solar powered desalination plant on some of its flatter, more
stable land, and that provides its people with a dependable supply of
water.

But it can't protect itself from the encroaching sea, the crumbling
earth, the crumbling economy, or the desperate refugees. Even getting
back and forth to work, for those few who can't work at home, was
becoming as dangerous for them as it is for our people---a kind of
terrible gauntlet that has to be run over and over again.

Then the people of KSF showed up. After many promises, much haggling,
suspicion, fear, hope, and legal wrangling, the voters and the officials
of Olivar permitted their town to be taken over, bought out, privatized.
KSF will expand the desalination plant to vast size. That plant will be
the first of many. The company intends to dominate farming and the
selling of water and solar and wind energy over much of the
southwest---where for pennies it's already bought vast tracts of
fertile, waterless land. So far, Olivar is one of its smaller coastal
holdings, but with Olivar, it gets an eager, educated work force, people
a few years older than I am whose options are very limited. And there's
all that formerly public land that they now control. They mean to own
great water, power, and agricultural industries in an area that most
people have given up on. They have long-term plans, and the people of
Olivar have decided to become part of them---to accept smaller salaries
than their socio-economic group is used to in exchange for security, a
guaranteed food supply, jobs, and help in their battle with the Pacific.

There are still people in Olivar who are uncomfortable with the change.
They know about early American company towns in which the companies
cheated and abused people.

But this is to be different. The people of Olivar aren't frightened,
impoverished victims. They're able to look after themselves, their
rights and their property. They're educated people who don't want to
live in the spreading chaos of the rest of Los Angeles County. Some of
them said so on the radio documentary we all listened to last night---as
they made a public spectacle of selling themselves to KSF.

"Good luck to them," Dad said. "Not that they'll have much luck in the
long run."

"What do you mean?" Cory demanded. "I think the whole idea is wonderful.
It's what we need. Now if only some big company would want to do the
same thing with Robledo."

"No," Dad said. "Thank God, no."

"You don't know! Why shouldn't they?"

"Robledo's too big, too poor, too black, and too Hispanic to be of
interest to anyone---and it has no coastline. What it does have is
street poor, body dumps, and a memory of once being well-off---of shade
trees, big houses, hills, and canyons. Most of those things are still
here, but no company will want us."

At the end of the program it was announced that KSF was looking for
registered nurses, credentialed teachers, and a few other skilled
professionals who would be willing to move to Olivar and work for room
and board. The offer wasn't put that way, of course, but that's what it
meant. Yet Cory recorded the phone number and called it at once. She and
Dad are both teachers, both Ph.D.'s. She was desperate to get in ahead
of the crowd. Dad just shrugged and let her call.

Room and board. The offered salaries were so low that if Dad and Cory
both worked, they wouldn't earn as much as Dad is earning now with the
college. And out of it they'd have to pay rent as well as the usual
expenses. In fact, when you add everything up, it's clear that with the
six of us, they couldn't earn enough to meet expenses. It might work if
I could find a job of some kind, but in Olivar they don't need me.
They've got hundreds of me, at least---maybe thousands. Every surviving
community is full of unemployed, half-educated kids or unemployed,
uneducated kids.

Anyone KSF hired would have a hard time living on the salary offered. In
not very much time, I think the new hires would be in debt to the
company. That's an old company-town trick---get people into debt, hang
on to them, and work them harder. Debt slavery. That might work in
Christopher Donner's America. Labor laws, state and federal, are not
what they once were.

"We could *try,"* Cory insisted to Dad. "We could be safe in Olivar. The
kids could go to a real school and later get jobs with the company.
After all, where can they go from here except outside?"

Dad shook his head. "Don't hope for it, Cory. There's nothing safe about
slavery."

Marcus and I were still up, listening. The two younger boys had been
sent to bed, but we four were still clustered around the radio. Now
Marcus spoke up.

"Olivar doesn't sound like slavery," he said. "Those rich people would
never let themselves be slaves."

Dad gave him a sad smile. "Not now," he said. "Not at first." He shook
his head. "Kagimoto, Stamm, Frampton: Japanese, German, Canadian. When I
was young, people said it would come to this. Well, why shouldn't other
countries buy what's left of us if we put it up for sale. I wonder how
many of the people in Olivar have any idea what they're doing."

"I don't think many do," I said. "I don't think they'd dare let
themselves know."

He looked at me, and I looked back. I'm still learning how dogged people
can be in denial, even when their freedom or their lives are at stake.
He's lived with it longer. I wonder how.

Marcus said, "Lauren, you ought to want to go to some place like Olivar
more than anyone. You share pain every time you see someone get hurt.
There'd be a lot less pain in Olivar."

"And there would be all those guards," I said. "I've noticed that people
who have a little bit of power tend to use it. All those guards KSF is
bringing in---they won't be allowed to bother the rich people, at least
at first. But new, bare-bones, work-for-room-and-board employees. ...
I'll bet they'll be fair game."

"There's no reason to believe the company would allow that kind of
thing," Cory said. "Why do you always expect the worst of everyone?"

"When it comes to strangers with guns," I told her, "I think suspicion
is more likely to keep you alive than trust."

She made a sharp, wordless sound of disgust. "You know nothing about the
world. You think you have all the answers but you know nothing!"

I didn't argue. There wasn't much point in my arguing with her.

"I doubt that Olivar is looking for families of blacks and Hispanics,
anyway," Dad said. "The Baiters or the Garfields or even some of the
Dunns might get in, but I don't think we would. Even if I were trusting
enough to put my family into KSF's hands, they wouldn't have us."

"We could try it," Cory insisted. "We should! We wouldn't be any worse
off than we are now if they turn us down. And if we got in and we didn't
like it, we could come back here. We could rent the house to one of the
big families here---charge them just a little, then---"

"Then come back here jobless and penniless," Dad said. "No, I mean it.
This business sounds half antebellum revival and half science fiction. I
don't trust it. Freedom is dangerous, Cory, but it's precious, too. You
can't just throw it away or let it slip away. You can't sell it for
bread and pottage."

Cory stared at him---just stared. He refused to look away. Cory got up
and went to their bedroom. I saw her there a few minutes later, sitting
on the bed, cradling the urn of Keith's ashes, and crying.

Saturday, October 24, 2026

Marcus tells me the Garfields are trying to get into Olivar. He's been
spending a lot of time with Robin Baiter and she told him. She hates the
idea because she likes her cousin Joanne a lot better than she does her
two sisters. She's afraid that if Joanne goes away to Olivar, she'll
never see her again. I suspect she's right.

I can't imagine this place without the Garfields. Joanne, Jay, Phillida.
... We've lost individuals before, of course, but we've never lost a
whole family. I mean ... they'll be alive, but ... they'll be gone.

I hope they're refused. I know it's selfish, but I don't care. Not that
it makes any difference what I hope. Oh hell. I hope they get whatever
will be best for their survival. I hope they'll be all right.

At 13, my brother Marcus has become the only person in the family whom I
would call beautiful. Girls his age stare at him when they think he's
not looking. They giggle a lot around him and chase him like crazy, but
he sticks to Robin. She's not pretty at all---all skin and bones and
brains---but she's funny and sensible. In a year or two, she'll start to
fill out and my brother will get beauty along with all those brains.
Then, if the two of them are still together, their lives will get a lot
more interesting.

I've changed my mind. I used to wait for the explosion, the big crash,
the sudden chaos that would destroy the neighborhood. Instead, things
are unraveling, disintegrating bit by bit. Susan Talcott Bruce and her
husband have applied to Olivar. Other people are talking about applying,
thinking about it. There's a small college in Olivar. There are lethal
security devices to keep thugs and the street poor out. There are more
jobs opening up. ...

Maybe Olivar is the future---one face of it. Cities controlled by big
companies are old hat in science fiction. My grandmother left a whole
bookcase of old science fiction novels. The company-city subgenre always
seemed to star a hero who outsmarted, overthrew, or escaped "the
company." I've never seen one where the hero fought like hell to get
taken in and underpaid by the company. In real life, that's the way it
will be. That's the way it is.

And what should I be doing? What can I do? In less than a year, I'll be
18, an adult---an adult with no prospects except life in our
disintegrating neighborhood. Or Earthseed.

To begin Earthseed, I'll have to go outside. I've known that for a long
time, but the idea scares me just as much as it always has.

Next year when I'm 18, I'll go. That means now I have to begin to plan
how I'll handle it.

Saturday, October 31, 2026

I'm going to go north. My grandparents once traveled a lot by car. They
left us old road maps of just about every county in the state plus
several of other parts of the country. The newest of them is 40 years
old, but that doesn't matter. The roads will still be there. They'll
just be in worse shape than they were back when my grandparents drove a
gas-fueled car over them. I've put maps of the California counties north
of us and the few I could find of Washington and Oregon counties into my
pack.

I wonder if there are people outside who will pay me to teach them
reading and writing---basic stuff---or people who will pay me to read or
write for them. Keith started me thinking about that. I might even be
able to teach some Earthseed verses along with the reading and writing.
Given any chance at all, teaching is what I would choose to do. Even if
I have to take other kinds of work to get enough to eat, I can teach. If
I do it well, it will draw people to me---to Earthseed.

***All successful life is***

***Adaptable,***

***Opportunistic,***

***Tenacious,***

***Interconnected, and***

***Fecund.***

***Understand this.***

***Use it.***

***Shape God.***

I wrote that verse a few months ago. It's true like all the verses. It
seems more true than ever now, more useful to me when I'm afraid.

I've finally got a title for my book of Earthseed verses---Earthseed:
The Book of the Living. There are the Tibetan and the Egyptian Books of
the Dead. Dad has copies of them. I've never heard of anything called a
book of the living, but I wouldn't be surprised to discover that there
is something. I don't care. I'm trying to speak---to write---the truth.
I'm trying to be clear. I'm not interested in being fancy, or even
original. Clarity and truth will be plenty, if I can only achieve them.
If it happens that there are other people outside somewhere preaching my
truth, I'll join them. Otherwise, I'll adapt where I must, take what
opportunities I can find or make, hang on, gather students, and teach.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Saturday, November 14, 2026

T[HE GARFIELDS HAVE BEEN]{.small} accepted at Olivar.

They'll be moving next month. That soon. I've known them all my life,
and they'll be gone. Joanne and I have had our differences, but we grew
up together. I thought somehow that when I left, she would still be
here. Everyone would still be here, frozen in time just as I left them.
But no, that's fantasy. God is Change.

"Do you want to go?" I asked her this morning. We had gotten together to
pick a few early lemons and navel oranges and some persimmons, almost
ripe and brilliant orange. We picked at my house, and then at hers,
enjoying the work. The weather was cool. It was good to be outside.

"I have to go," she said. "What else is there for me---for anyone. It's
all going to hell here. You know it is."

I stared at her. I guess discussing such things is all right now that
she has a way out. "So you move into another fortress," I said.

"It's a better fortress. It won't have people coming over the walls,
killing old ladies."

"Your mother says all you'll have is an apartment. No yard. No garden.
You'll have less money, but you'll have to use more of it to buy food."

"We'll manage!" There was a brittle quality to her voice.

I put down the old rake I was using as a fruit picker. It worked fine on
the lemons and oranges. "Scared?" I asked.

She put down her own real fruit picker with its awkward extension handle
and small fruit-catching basket. It was best for persimmons. She hugged
herself. "I've lived here, lived with trees and gardens all my life. I
... don't know how it will be to be shut up in an apartment. It does
scare me, but we'll manage. We'll have to."

"You can come back here if things aren't what you hope. Your
grandparents and your aunt's family will still be here."

"Harry will still be here," she whispered, looking toward her house. I
would have to stop thinking of it as the Garfield house. Harry and
Joanne were at least as close as Curtis and I. I hadn't thought about
her leaving him---what that must be like. I like Harry Baiter. I
remember being surprised when he and Joanne first started going
together. They'd lived in the same house all their lives. I had thought
of Harry almost as her brother. But they were only first cousins, and
against the odds, they had managed to fall in love. Or I thought they
had. They hadn't gone with anyone else for years. Everyone assumed they
would get around to marrying when they were a little older.

"Marry him and take him with you," I said.

"He won't go," she said in that same whisper. "We've talked and talked
about it. He wants me to stay here with him, get married soon and go
north. Just ... go with no prospects. Nothing. It's crazy."

"Why won't he go to Olivar?"

"He thinks the way your father does. He thinks Olivar's a trap. He's
read about nineteenth and early twentieth century company towns, and he
says no matter how great Olivar looks, all we'll get from it in the end
is debt and loss of freedom."

I knew Harry had sense. "Jo," I said, "you'll be of age next year. You
could stay here with the Baiters until then and marry. Or you could talk
your father into letting you marry now."

"And then what? Go join the street poor? Stay and stuff more babies into
that crowded house. Harry doesn't have a job, and there's no real chance
of his getting one that pays money. Are we supposed to live on what
Harry's parents earn? What kind of future is that? None! None at all!"

Sensible. Conservative and sensible and mature and *wrong.* Very much in
character with Joanne.

Or maybe I was the one who was wrong. Maybe the security Joanne will
find in Olivar is the only kind of security to be had for anyone who
isn't rich. To me, though, security in Olivar isn't much more attractive
than the security Keith has finally found in his urn.

I picked a few more lemons and some oranges and wondered what she would
do if she knew I was also planning to leave next year. Would she run to
her mother again, frightened for me, and eager to have someone protect
me from myself? She might. She wants a future she can understand and
depend on---a future that looks a lot like her parents' present. I don't
think that's possible. Things are changing too much, too fast. Who can
fight God?

We put baskets of fruit inside my back door on the porch, then headed
for her house.

"What will you do?" she asked me as we walked. "Are you just going to
stay here? I mean ... are you going to stay and marry Curtis?"

I shrugged and lied. "I don't know. If I marry anyone, it will be
Curtis. But I don't know about marrying. I don't want to have children
here any more than you do. I know we'll be staying here for a while
longer, though. Dad won't let Cory even apply to Olivar. I'm glad of
that because I don't want to go there. But there'll be other Olivars.
Who knows what I might wind up doing?" That last didn't feel like a lie.

"You think there'll be more privatized cities?" she asked.

"Bound to be if Olivar succeeds. This country is going to be parceled
out as a source of cheap labor and cheap land. When people like those in
Olivar beg to sell themselves, our surviving cities are bound to wind up
the economic colonies of whoever can afford to buy them."

"Oh, God, there you go again. You've always got a disaster up your
sleeve."

"I see what's out there. You see it too. You just deny it."

"Remember when you thought starving hordes were going to come crawling
over our walls and we would have to run away to the mountains and eat
grass?"

Did *I remember?* I turned to face her, first angry---furious---then to
my own surprise, sad. "I'll miss you," I said.

She must have read my feelings. "I'm sorry," she whispered.

We hugged each other. I didn't ask her what she was sorry for, and she
didn't say any more.

Dad didn't come home today. He was due this morning.

I don't know what that means. I don't know what to think. I'm scared to
death.

Cory called the college, his friends, fellow ministers, co-workers, the
cops, the hospitals ...

Nothing. He isn't under arrest or sick or injured or dead---at least not
as far as anyone knows. None of his friends or colleagues had seen him
since he left work early this morning. His bike was working all right.
He was all right.

He had ridden off toward home with three co-workers who lived in other
neighborhoods in our area. Each of these said the same thing: That they
had left him as usual at River Street where it intersects Durant Road.
That's only five blocks from here. We're at the tip-end of Durant Road.

So where is he?

Today a group of us, all armed, rode bicycles from home to River Street
and down River Street to the college. Five miles in all. We checked side
streets, alleys, vacant buildings, every place we could think of. I
went. I took Marcus with me because if I hadn't, he would have gone out
alone. I had the Smith & Wesson. Marcus had only his knife. He's quick
and agile with it, and strong for his age, but he's never used it on
anything alive. If anything had happened to him, I don't think I would
have dared to go home. Cory is already out of her mind with worry. All
this on top of losing Keith. ... I don't know. Everyone helped. Jay
Garfield will be leaving soon, but that didn't stop him from leading the
search. He's a good man. He did everything he could think of to find
Dad.

Tomorrow we're going into the hills and canyons. We have to. No one
wants to, but what else can we do?

Wednesday, November 18, 2026

I've never seen more squalor, more human remains, more feral dogs than I
saw today. I have to write. I have to dump this onto paper. I can't keep
it inside of me. Seeing the dead has never bothered me before, but this
...

We were looking for Dad's body, of course, though no one said so. I
couldn't deny that reality or avoid thinking about it. Cory checked with
the police again, with the hospitals, with everyone we could think of
who knew Dad.

Nothing.

So we had to go to the hills. When we go for target practice, we don't
look around, except to ensure safety. We don't look for what we'd rather
not find. Today in groups of three or four, we combed through the area
nearest to the top of River Street. I kept Marcus with me---which was
not easy. What is it in young boys that makes them want to wander off
alone and get killed? They get two chin hairs and they're trying to
prove they're men.

"You watch my back and I'll watch yours," I said. "I'm not going to let
you get hurt. Don't you let me down."

He gave me the kind of near-smile that said he knew exactly what I was
trying to do, and that he was going to do as he pleased. I got mad and
grabbed him by the shoulders.

"Dammit, Marcus, how many sisters have you got? How many fathers have
you got!" I never used even mild profanity with him unless things were
very serious. Now, it got his attention.

"Don't worry," he muttered. "I'll help."

Then we found the arm. Marcus was the one who spotted it---something
dark lying just off the trail we were following. It was hung up in the
low branches of a scrub oak.

The arm was fresh and whole---a hand, a lower, and an upper arm. A black
man's arm, just the color of my father's where color could be seen. It
was slashed and cut all over, yet still powerful looking---long-boned,
long-fingered, yet muscular and massive. ... Familiar?

Smooth, white bone stuck out at the shoulder end. The arm had been cut
off with a sharp knife. The bone wasn't broken. And, yes. It could have
been his.

Marcus threw up when he saw it. I made myself examine it, search it for
something familiar, for certainty. Jay Garfield tried to stop me, and I
shoved him away and told him to go to hell. I'm sorry for that, and I
told him so later. But I had to know. And yet, I still don't know. The
arm was too slashed and covered in dried blood. I couldn't tell. Jay
Garfield took fingerprints in his pocket notebook, but we left the arm
itself. How could we take that back to Cory?

And we kept searching. What else could we do? George Hsu found a
rattlesnake. It didn't bite anyone and we didn't kill it. I don't think
anyone was in a mood to kill things.

We saw dogs, but they kept away from us. I even saw a cat watching us
from under a bush. Cats either run like hell or crouch and freeze.
They're interesting to watch, somehow. Or, at any other time, they'd be
interesting.

Then someone began to scream. I've never heard screams like that
before---on and on. A man, screaming, begging, praying: "No! No more!
Oh, God, no more, please. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, *please!"* Then there
were wordless, grating cries and high, horrible mewling.

It was a man's voice, not like my father's but not that different from
his. We couldn't locate the source. The echoes bounced around the
canyon, confusing us, sending us first in one direction, then in
another. The canyon was full of loose rock and spiny, vicious plants
that kept us on the pathways where there were pathways.

The screaming stopped, then began again as a kind of horrible, bubbling
noise.

I had let myself fall back to the end of the line of us by then. I
wasn't in trouble. Sound doesn't trigger my sharing. I have to see
another person in pain before I do any sharing. And this was one I'd do
*anything* to avoid seeing.

Marcus dropped back beside me and whispered, "You okay?"

"Yeah," I said. "I just don't want to know anything about what's
happening to that man."

"Keith," he said.

"I know," I agreed.

We walked our bikes behind the others, watching the back trail. Kayla
Talcott dropped back to see if we were all right. She hadn't wanted us
to come, but since we had come, she had come, she had kept an eye on us.
She's like that.

"It doesn't sound like your daddy," she said. "Doesn't sound like him at
all." Kayla is from Texas like my biological mother. Sometimes she
sounded as though she'd never left, and sometimes she sounded as though
she'd never been near any part of the south. She seemed to be able to
turn the accent on and off. She tended to turn it on for comforting
people, and for threatening to kill them. Sometimes when I'm with
Curtis, I see her in his face and wonder what kind of relative---what
kind of mother-in-law---she would make. Today I think both Marcus and I
were glad she was there. We needed to be close to someone with her kind
of mothering strength.

The horrible noise ended. Maybe the poor man was dead and out of his
misery. I hope so.

We never found him. We found human bones and animal bones. We found the
rotting corpses of five people scattered among the boulders. We found
the cold remains of a fire with a human femur and two human skulls lying
among the ashes.

At last, we came home and wrapped our community wall around us and
huddled in our illusions of security.

Sunday, November 22, 2026

No one has found my father. Almost every adult in the neighborhood has
spent some time looking. Richard Moss didn't, but his oldest son and
daughter did. Wardell Parrish didn't, but his sister and oldest nephew
did. I don't know what else people could have done. If I did know, I
would be out doing it.

And yet nothing, nothing, nothing! The police never came up with any
sign of him. He never turned up anywhere. He's vanished, gone. Even the
severed arm's fingerprints weren't his.

Every night since Wednesday, I've dreamed that horrible screaming. I've
gone out twice more with teams hunting through the canyons. We've found
nothing but more of the dead and the poorest of the living---people who
are all staring eyes and visible bones. My own bones ached in empathy.
Sometimes if I sleep for a while without hearing the screaming, I see
these---the living dead. I've always seen them. I've never seen them.

A team I wasn't with found a living child being eaten by dogs. The team
killed the dogs, then watched, helpless as the boy died.

I spoke at services this morning. Maybe it was my duty. I don't know.
People came for church, all uncertain and upset, not knowing what they
should do. I think they wanted to draw together, and they had years of
habit drawing them together at our house on Sunday morning. They were
uncertain and hesitant, but they came.

Both Wyatt Talcott and Jay Garfield offered to speak. Both did say a few
words, both informally eulogizing my father, though neither admitted
that that was what they were doing. I was afraid everyone would do that
and the service would become an impossible impromptu funeral. When I
stood up, it wasn't just to say a couple of words. I meant to give them
something they could take home---something that might make them feel
that enough had been said for today.

I thanked them all for the ongoing---emphasize ongoing---efforts to find
my father. Then ... well, then I talked about perseverance. I preached a
sermon about perseverance if an unordained kid can be said to preach a
sermon. No one was going to stop me. Cory was the only one who might
have tried, but Cory was in a kind of walking coma. She wasn't doing
anything she didn't have to do.

So I preached from Luke, chapter eighteen, verses one through eight: the
parable of the importunate widow. It's one I've always liked. A widow is
so persistent in her demands for justice that she overcomes the
resistance of a judge who fears neither God nor man. She wears him down.

Moral: The weak can overcome the strong if the weak persist. Persisting
isn't always safe, but it's often necessary.

My father and the adults present had created and maintained our
community in spite of the scarcity and the violence outside. Now, with
my father or without him, that community had to go on, hold together,
survive. I talked about my nightmares and the source of those
nightmares. Some people might not have wanted their kids to hear things
like that, but I didn't care. If Keith had known more, maybe he would
still be alive. But I didn't mention Keith. People could say what
happened to Keith was his own fault. No one could say that about Dad. I
didn't want anyone to be able to say it about this community some day.

"Those nightmares of mine are our future if we fail one another," I
said, winding up. "Starvation, agony at the hands of people who aren't
human any more. Dismemberment. Death.

"We have God and we have each other. We have our island community,
fragile, and yet a fortress. Sometimes it seems too small and too weak
to survive. And like the widow in Christ's parable, its enemies fear
neither God nor man. But also like the widow, it persists. *We persist.*
This is our place, no matter what."

That was my message. I left it there, hanging before them with an
unfinished feel to it. I could feel them expecting more, then realizing
that I wasn't going to say more, then biting down on what I had said.

At just the right moment, Kayla Talcott began an old song. Others took
it up, singing slowly, but with feeling: "We shall not, we shall not be
moved. ..."

I think this might have sounded weak or even pitiful somehow if it had
been begun by a lesser voice. I think I might have sang it weakly. I'm
only a fair singer. Kayla, on the other hand, has a big voice,
beautiful, clear, and able to do everything she asks of it. Also, Kayla
has a reputation for not moving unless she wants to.

Later, as she was leaving, I thanked her.

She looked at me. I'd grown past her years ago, and she had to look up.
"Good job," she said, and nodded and walked away toward her house. I
love her.

I got other compliments today, and I think they were sincere. Most said,
in one way or another, "You're right," and "I didn't know you could
preach like that," and "Your father would be proud of you."

Yeah, I hope so. I did it for him. He built this bunch of houses into a
community. And now, he's probably dead. I wouldn't let them bury him,
but I know. I'm no good at denial and self-deception. That was Dad's
funeral that I was preaching---his and the community's. Because as much
as I want all that I said to be true, it isn't. We'll be moved, all
right. It's just a matter of when, by whom, and in how many pieces.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Saturday, December 19, 2026

T[ODAY REVEREND MATTHEW ROBINSON]{.small} in whose church I was baptized
came to preach my fathers funeral. Cory made the arrangements. There was
no body, no urn. No one knows what happened to my father. Neither we nor
the police have been able to find out. We're sure he's dead. He would
find a way to come home if he were alive, so we're certain he's dead.

No, we're not certain. We're not certain at all. Is he sick somewhere?
Hurt? Held against his will for who knows what reason by who knows what
monsters?

This is worse than when Keith died. So much worse. As horrible as that
was, we knew he was dead. Whatever he suffered, we knew he wasn't
suffering any more. Not in this world, anyway. We *knew.* Now, we don't
know anything. He is dead. But we don't *know!*

The Dunns must of felt this when Tracy vanished. Crazy as they are,
crazy as she was, they must have felt this. What do they feel now? Tracy
never came back. If she's not dead, what must be happening to her
outside? A girl alone only faced one kind of future outside. I intend to
go out posing as a man when I go.

How will they feel when I go? I'll be dead to them---to Cory, the boys,
the neighborhood. They'll hope I'm dead, considering the supposed
alternative. Thank Dad for my tallness and my strength.

I won't have to leave Dad now. He's already left me. He was 57. What
reason would strangers have for keeping a 57-year-old man alive? Once
they'd robbed him, they would either let him go or kill him. If they let
him go, he'd come home, walking, limping, crawling.

So he's dead.

That's that.

It has to be.

Tuesday, December 22, 2026

The Garfields left for Olivar today---Phillida, Jay, and Joanne. An
armored KSF truck came from Olivar to collect them and their belongings.
The adults of the community had all they could do to keep the little
kids from climbing all over the truck and pestering the drivers to
death. Most kids my brothers' ages have never been close to a truck that
runs. Some of the younger Moss kids have never seen a truck of any kind.
The Moss kids weren't even allowed to visit the Yannis house back when
the Yannis television still worked.

The two guys from KSF were patient once they realized the kids weren't
thieves or vandals. Those two guys with their uniforms, pistols, whips,
and clubs, looked more like cops than movers. No doubt they had even
more substantial weapons in the truck. My brother Bennett said he saw
bigger guns mounted inside the truck when he climbed onto the hood. But
when you consider how much a truck that size is worth, and how many
people might want to relieve them of it and its contents, I guess the
weaponry isn't surprising.

The two movers were a black and a white, and I could see that Cory
considered that hopeful. Maybe Olivar wouldn't be the white enclave that
Dad had expected.

Cory cornered the black guy and talked to him for as long as he would
let her. Will she try now to get us into Olivar? I think she will. After
all, without Dad's salary, she'll have to do something. I don't think we
have a prayer of being accepted. The insurance company isn't going to
pay---or not for a long time. Its people choose not to believe that Dad
is dead. Without proof he can't be declared legally dead for seven
years. Can they hold on to our money for that long? I don't know, but it
wouldn't surprise me. We could starve many times over in seven years.
And Cory must know she alone can't earn enough in Olivar to feed and
house us. Is she hoping to get work for me, too? I don't know what we're
going to do.

Joanne and I cried all over each other, saying good-bye. We promised to
phone each other, to stay in touch. I don't think we'll be able to. It
costs extra to call Olivar. We won't be able to afford it. I don't think
she will either. Chances are, I'll never see her again. The people I've
grown up with are falling out of my life, one by one.

After the truck pulled away, I found Curtis and took him back to the old
darkroom to make love. We hadn't done it for a long time, and I needed
it. I wish I could imagine just marrying Curtis, staying here, and
having a decent life with him.

It isn't possible. Even if there were no Earthseed, it wouldn't be
possible. I would almost be doing the family a favor if I left now---one
less mouth to feed. Unless I could somehow get a job. ...

"We've got to get out of here, too," Curtis said as we lay together
afterward, lingering, tempting fate, not wanting to lose the feel of
each other so soon. But that wasn't what he had meant. I turned my head
to look at him.

"Don't you want to go?" he asked. "Wouldn't you like to get out of this
dead end neighborhood, out of Robledo."

I nodded. "I was just thinking that. But---"

"I want you to marry me, and I want us to get out of here," he said in a
near whisper. "This place is dying."

I raised myself to my elbows and looked down at him. The only light in
the room came from a single window up near the ceiling. Nothing covered
it any more, and the glass was broken out of it, but still, only a
little light came in. Curtis's face was full of shadows.

"Where do you want to go?" I asked him.

"Not Olivar," he said. "That could turn out to be a bigger dead end than
living here."

"Where, then?"

"I don't know. Oregon or Washington? Canada? Alaska?"

I don't think I gave any sign of sudden excitement. People tell me my
face doesn't show them what I'm feeling. My sharing has been a hard
teacher. But he saw something.

"You've already been thinking about leaving, haven't you," he demanded.
"That's why you won't talk about getting married."

I rested my hand on his smooth chest.

"You were thinking about going alone!" He grasped my wrist, seemed ready
to push it away. Then he held on to it, kept it. "You were just going to
walk away from here and leave me."

I turned so that he couldn't see my face because now I had a feeling my
emotions were all too obvious: Confusion, fear, hope. ... Of course I
had intended to go alone, and of course I hadn't told anyone that I was
leaving. And I had not decided yet how Dad's disappearance would affect
my going. That raised frightening questions. What are my
responsibilities? What will happen to my brothers if I leave them to
Cory? They're her sons, and she'll move the earth to take care of them,
keep them fed and clothed and housed. But can she do it alone? How?

"I want to go," I admitted, moving around, trying to be comfortable on
the pallet of old sleepsacks that we had put down on the concrete floor.
"I planned to go. Don't tell anyone."

"How can I if I go with you?"

I smiled, loving him. But ... "Cory and my brothers are going to need
help," I said. "When my father was here, I planned to go next year when
I'm eighteen. Now ... I don't know."

"Where were you going?"

"North. Maybe as far as Canada. Maybe not."

"Alone?"

"Yeah."

*"Why?"* Why alone, he meant.

I shrugged. "I could get killed as soon as I leave here. I could starve.
The cops could pick me up. Dogs could get me. I could catch a disease.
Anything could happen to me; I've thought about it. I haven't named half
the bad possibilities."

"That's why you need help!"

"That's why I couldn't ask anyone else to walk away from food and
shelter and as much safety as there is in our world. To just start
walking north, and hope you wind up some place good. How could I ask
that of you?"

"It's not that bad. Farther north, we can get work."

"Maybe. But people have been flooding north for years. Jobs are scarce
up there, too. And statelines and borders are closed."

"There's nothing down there!"

"I know."

"So how can you help Cory and your brothers?"

"I don't know. We haven't figured out what to do. So far, nothing I've
thought of will work."

"They'd have more of everything if you left."

"Maybe. But, Curtis, how can I leave them? Could you walk away and leave
your family, not knowing how they would manage to survive?"

"Sometimes I think so," he said.

I ignored that. He didn't get along very well with his brother Michael,
but his family was probably the strongest unit in the neighborhood. Take
on one of them and you've got to deal with them all. He would never walk
away from them if they were in trouble.

"Marry me now," he said. "We'll stay here and help your family get on
its feet. Then we'll leave."

"Not now," I said. "I can't see how anything is going to work out now.
Everything's too crazy."

"And what? You think it's going to get sane? It's never been sane. You
just have to go ahead and live, no matter what."

I didn't know what to say, so I kissed him. But I couldn't distract him.

"I hate this room," he said. "I hate hiding to be with you and I hate
playing games." He paused. "But I do love you. Damn! Sometimes I almost
wish I didn't."

"Don't wish that," I said. He knew so little about me, and he thought he
knew everything. I'd never told him about my sharing, for instance. I'll
have to before I marry him. If I don't, when he finds out, he'll know I
didn't trust him enough to be honest, with him. And not much is known
about sharing. Suppose I pass it on to my kids?

Then there's Earthseed. I'll have to tell him about that. What will he
think? That I've gone crazy? I can't tell him. Not yet.

"We could live at your house," he said. "My parents would help out with
food. Maybe I could find some kind of job. ..."

"I want to marry you," I said. I hesitated, and there was absolute
silence. I couldn't believe I'd heard myself say such a thing, but it
was true. Maybe I was just feeling bereft. Keith, my father, the
Garfields, Mrs. Quintanilla. ... People could disappear so easily. I
wanted someone with me who cared about me, and who wouldn't disappear.
But my judgment wasn't entirely gone.

"When my family is back on its feet, we'll marry," I said. "Then we can
get out of here. I just have to know that my brothers will be all
right."

"If we're going to marry anyway, why not do it now?"

Because I have things to tell you, I thought. Because if you reject me
or make me reject you with your reactions, I don't want to have to hang
around and watch you with someone else.

"Not now," I said. "Wait for me."

He shook his head in obvious disgust. "What the hell do you think I've
been doing?"

Thursday, December 24, 2026

It's Christmas Eve.

Last night someone set fire to the Payne-Parrish house. While the
community tried to put out the fire, and then tried to keep it from
spreading, three other houses were robbed. Ours was one of the three:

Thieves took all our store-bought food: wheat flour, sugar, canned
goods, packaged goods. ... They took our radio---our last one. The crazy
thing is, before we went to bed we had been listening to a half-hour
news feature about increasing arson. People are setting more fires to
cover crimes---although why they would bother these days, I don't know.
The police are no threat to criminals. People are setting fires to do
what our arsonist did last night---to get the neighbors of the arson
victim to leave their own homes unguarded. People are setting fires to
get rid of whomever they dislike from personal enemies to anyone who
looks or sounds foreign or racially different. People are setting fires
because they're frustrated, angry, hopeless. They have no power to
improve their lives, but they have the power to make others even more
miserable. And the only way to prove to yourself that you have power is
to use it.

Then there's that fire drug with it's dozen or so names: Blaze, fuego,
flash, sunfire. ... The most popular name is pyro---short for pyromania.
It's all the same drug, and it's been around for a while. From what
Keith said, it's becoming more popular. It makes watching the leaping,
changing patterns of fire a better, more intense, longer-lasting high
than sex. Like Paracetco, my biological mother's drug of choice, pyro
screws around with people's neurochemistry. But Paracetco began as a
legitimate drug intended to help victims of Alzheimer's disease. Pyro
was an accident. It was a homebrew---a basement drug invented by someone
who was trying to assemble one of the other higher-priced street drugs.
The inventor made a very small chemical mistake, and wound up with pyro.
That happened on the east coast and caused an immediate increase in the
number of senseless arson fires, large and small.

Pyro worked its way west without making nearly as much trouble as it
could have. Now its popularity is growing. And in dry-as-straw Southern
California, it can cause a real orgy of burning.

"My God," Cory said when the radio report was over. And in a small,
whispery voice, she quoted from the Book of Revelation: "'Babylon the
great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils.
...'"

And the devils set fire to the Payne-Parrish house.

At about two [A.M.]{.small} I woke to the jangling of the bell:
Emergency! Earthquake? Fire? Intruders?

But there was no shaking, no unfamiliar noise, no smoke. Whatever was
happening, it wasn't at our house. I got up, threw clothing on, debated
for a second whether to snatch my survival pack, then left it. Our house
didn't seem to be in immediate danger. My pack was safe in the closet,
mixed in among blankets and bundles of old clothes. If I had to have it,
I could come back and snatch it in seconds.

I ran outside to see what was needed, and saw at once. The Payne-Parrish
house was fully involved, surrounded by fire. One of the watchers on
duty was still sounding the alarm. People spilled from all the houses,
and must have seen as I did that the Parrish house was a total loss.
Neighbors were already wetting down the houses on either side. A live
oak tree---one of our huge, ancient ones---was afire. There was a light
wind blowing, swirling bits of burning leaves and twigs into the air and
scattering them. I joined the people who were beating and wetting the
grounds.

Where were the Paynes? Where was Wardell Parrish? Had anyone called the
fire department? A house full of people, after all, it wasn't like a
burning garage.

I asked several people. Kayla Talcott said she had called them. I was
grateful and ashamed. I wouldn't have asked if Dad were still with us.
One of us would have just called. Now we couldn't afford to call.

No one had seen any of the Paynes. Wardell Parrish I found in the Yannis
yard where Cory and my brother Bennett were wrapping him in a blanket.
He was coughing so much that he couldn't talk, and wearing only pajama
pants.

"Is he okay?" I asked.

"He breathed a lot of smoke," Cory said. "Has someone called---"

"Kayla Talcott called the fire department."

"Good. But no one's at the gate to let them in."

"I'll go." I turned away, but she caught my arm.

"The others?" she whispered. She meant the Paynes, of course.

"I don't know."

She nodded and let me go.

I went to the gate, borrowing Alex Montoya's key on the way. He always
seemed to have his gate key in his pocket. It was because of him that I
didn't go back into our house and maybe interrupt a robbery and be
killed for my trouble.

Firefighters arrived in no great hurry. I let them in, locked the gate
after them, and watched as they put out the fire.

No one had seen the Paynes. We could only assume they had never gotten
out. Cory tried to take Wardell Parrish to our house, but he refused to
leave until he found out one way or the other about his twin sister and
his nieces and nephews.

When the fire was almost out, the bell began to ring again. We all
looked around. Caroline Baiter, Harry's mother, was jerking and pushing
at the bell and screaming.

"Intruders!" she shouted. "Thieves! They've broken into the houses!"

And we all rushed without thinking back to our houses. Wardell Parrish
came along with my family, still coughing, and wheezing, and as
useless---as weaponless---as the rest of us. We could have been killed,
rushing in that way. Instead, we were lucky. We scared away our thieves.

Along with our store-bought food and the radio, the thieves got some of
Dad's tools and supplies---nails, wire, screws, bolts, that kind of
thing. They didn't get the phone, the computer, or anything in Dad's
office. In fact, they didn't get into Dad's office at all. I suppose we
scared them away before they could search the whole house.

They stole clothing and shoes from Cory's room, but didn't touch my room
or the boys'. They got some of our money---the kitchen money, Cory calls
it. She had hidden it in the kitchen in a box of detergent. She had
thought no one would steal such a thing. In fact, the thieves might have
stolen it for resale without realizing that it wasn't just detergent. It
could have been worse. The kitchen money was only about a thousand
dollars for minor emergencies.

The thieves did not find the rest of our money, some of it hidden out by
our lemon tree, and some hidden with our two remaining guns under the
floor in Cory's closet. Dad had gone to a lot of trouble to make a kind
of floor safe, not locked, but completely concealed beneath a rug and a
battered chest of drawers filled with sewing things---salvaged bits of
cloth, buttons, zippers, hooks, things like that. The chest of drawers
could be moved with one hand. It slid from one side of the closet to the
other if you pushed it right, and in seconds you could have the money
and the guns in your hands. The concealment trick wouldn't have defeated
people who had time to make a thorough search, but it had defeated our
thieves. They had dumped some of the drawers onto the floor, but they
had not thought to look under the chest.

The thieves did take Cory's sewing machine. It was a compact, sturdy old
machine with its own carrying case. Both case and machine were gone.
That was a real blow. Cory and I both use that machine to make, alter,
and repair clothing for the family. I had thought I might even be able
to earn some money with the machine, sewing for other people in the
neighborhood. Now the machine is gone. Sewing for the family will have
to be done by hand. It will take much more time, and may not look like
what we're used to. Bad. Hard. But not a fatal blow. Cory cried over the
loss of her machine, but we can get along without it. She's just being
worn down by one blow after another.

We'll adapt. We'll have to. God is Change.

Strange how much it helps me to remember that.

Curtis Talcott just came to my window to tell me that the firemen have
found charred bodies and bones in the ashes of the Payne-Parrish house.
The police are here, taking reports of the robberies and the obvious
arson. I told Cory. She can tell Wardell Parrish or let the cops tell
him. He's lying down on one of our living room couches. I doubt that
he's sleeping. Even though I've never liked him, I feel sorry for him.
He's lost his house and his family. He's the only survivor. What must
that be like?

Tuesday, December 29, 2026

I don't know how long it can last, but in some way that I suspect is not
quite legal, Cory has taken over part of the job Dad held for so long.
She'll give the classes Dad gave. With the computer hookups we have
already in place, she'll issue assignments, receive homework, and be
available for phone and compu-conferences. The administrative part of
Dad's work will be handled by someone else who can use the extra money,
and who is willing to show up at the college more often than once or
twice a month. It will be as though Dad were still teaching, but had
decided to give up his other responsibilities.

Cory has arranged this by pleading and begging, by crying and cajoling
and calling in every favor and every friend she could think of. People
at the college know her. She taught there before Bennett's birth, before
she saw the need here and began the front-room school that serves all
the children of the neighborhood. Dad was all for her quitting the
college because he didn't want her going back and forth outside, exposed
to all the dangers that involved. The neighbors pay a per-kid fee, but
it isn't much. No one could support a household on it.

Now Cory will have to go outside again. She's already drafting men and
older boys in the neighborhood to escort her when she has to go out.
There are plenty of unemployed men here, and Cory will be paying them a
small fee.

So in a few days, the new term will start and Cory will do Dad's
work---while I do her work. I'll handle the school with help from her
and from Russel Dory, Joanne and Harry's grandfather. He used to be a
high school math teacher. He's been retired for years, but he's still
sharp. I don't think I need his help, but Cory does, and he's willing,
so that's that.

Alex Montoya and Kayla Talcott will take over Dad's preaching and other
church work. Neither is ordained, but both have substituted for Dad in
the past. Both have authority in the community and the church. And, of
course, both know their Bible.

This is how we will survive and hold together. It will work. I don't
know how long it will last, but for now, it will work.

Wednesday, December 30, 2026

Wardell Parrish has finally dragged himself back to his people---to the
part of his family that he lived with before he and his sister inherited
the Sims house. He's stayed with us since his sister and all her
children were killed. Cory gave him some of Dad's clothes which were too
big for him. Much too big.

He wandered around, not talking, not seeming to see anything, not eating
enough. ... Then yesterday he said, like a little boy, "I want to go
home. I can't stay here. I hate it here; everyone's dead! I have to go
home."

So today Wyatt Talcott, Michael, and Curtis escorted him home. Poor man.
He's years older than he was a week ago. I think he may not live much
longer.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Saturday, July 31, 2027---Morning

L[AST NIGHT, WHEN I]{.small} escaped from the neighborhood, it was
burning. The houses, the trees, the people: Burning.

Smoke awoke me, and I shouted down the hall to Cory and the boys. I
grabbed my clothes and emergency pack and followed Cory as she herded
the boys out.

The bell never rang. Our watchers must have been killed before they
could reach it.

Everything was chaos. People running, screaming, shooting. The gate had
been destroyed. Our attackers had driven an ancient truck through it.
They must have stolen a truck just to crash it through our gate.

I think they must have been pyro addicts---bald people with painted
heads, faces, and hands. Red faces; blue faces; green faces; screaming
mouths; avid, crazy eyes, glittering in the firelight.

They shot us and shot us and shot us. I saw Natalie Moss, running,
screaming, then pitching backward, her face half gone, her body still
impelled forward. She fell flat on her back, and did not move again.

I fell with her, caught up in her death. I lay there, dazed, struggling
to move, to get up. Cory and the boys, running ahead of me never
noticed. They ran on.

I got up, felt for my pack, found it, and ran. I tried not to see what
was happening around me. Hearing the gunfire and the screams didn't stop
me. A dead body---Edwin Dunn---didn't stop me. I bent, snatched up his
gun, and kept running.

Someone screamed near me, then tackled me, pulled me down. I fired the
gun in reflexive terror, and took the terrible impact in my own stomach.
A green face hung above mine, mouth open, eyes wide, not yet feeling all
his pain. I shot him again, terrified that his pain would immobilize me
when he did feel it. It seemed that he took a long time to die.

When I could move again, I pushed his body off me. I got up, still
holding the gun, and ran for the wrecked gate.

Best to be in the darkness outside. Best to hide.

I ran up Meredith Street away from Durant Road, away from the fires and
the shooting. I had lost track of Cory and the boys. I thought they
would go toward the hills and not toward the center of town. Every
direction was dangerous, but there was more danger where there were more
people. In the night, a woman and three kids might look like a gift
basket of food, money, and sex.

North toward the hills. North through the dark streets to where the
nearby hills and mountains blotted out the stars.

And then what?

I didn't know. I couldn't think. I had never been outside the walls when
it was so dark. My only hope of staying alive was to listen, hear any
movement before it got too close to me, see what I could by starlight,
be as quiet as I could.

I walked down the middle of the street looking and listening and trying
to avoid potholes and chunks of broken asphalt. There was little other
trash. Anything that would burn, people would use as fuel. Anything that
could be reused or sold had been gathered. Cory used to comment on that.
Poverty, she said, had made the streets cleaner.

Where was she? Where had she taken my brothers? Were they all right? Had
they even gotten out of the neighborhood?

I stopped. Were my brothers back there? Was Curtis? I hadn't seen him at
all---though if anyone were going to survive this insanity, it would be
the Talcotts. But we had no way of finding each other.

Sound. Footsteps. Two pairs of running footsteps. I stayed where I was,
frozen in place. No sudden moves to draw attention to me. Had I already
been seen? Could I be seen---a figure of darker darkness in an otherwise
empty street?

The sound was behind me. I listened and knew that it was off to one
side, approaching, passing. Two people running down a side street,
indifferent to the noise they made, indifferent to woman-shaped shadows.

I let out a breath and drew another through my mouth because I could get
more air with less sound that way. I couldn't go back to the fires and
the pain. If Cory and the boys were there, they were dead or worse,
captive. But they had been ahead of me. They must have gotten out. Cory
wouldn't let them come back to look for me. There was a bright glow in
the air over what had been our neighborhood. If she had gotten the boys
away, all she had to do was look back to know that she didn't want to go
back.

Did she have her Smith & Wesson? I wished I had it and the two boxes of
ammunition that went with it. All I had was the knife in my pack and
Edwin Dunn's old .45 automatic. And all the ammunition I had for it was
in it. If it wasn't empty. I knew the gun. It held seven rounds. I'd
fired it twice. How many times had Edwin Dunn fired it before someone
shot him? I didn't expect to find out until morning. I had a flashlight
in my pack, but I didn't intend to use it unless I could be certain I
wouldn't be making a target of myself.

During the day the sight of the bulge in my pocket would be enough to
make people think twice about robbing or raping me. But during the night
the blue gun would be all but invisible even in my hand. If it were
empty, I could only use it as a club. And the moment I hit someone with
it, I might as well hit myself. If I lost consciousness for any reason
during a fight, I would lose all my possessions if not my life. Tonight
I had to hide.

Tomorrow I would have to try to bluff as much as possible. Most people
wouldn't insist on my shooting them just to test whether or not the gun
was loaded. For the street poor, unable to afford medical care, even a
minor wound might be fatal.

I am one of the street poor, now. Not as poor as some, but homeless,
alone, full of books and ignorant of reality. Unless I meet someone from
the neighborhood, there's no one I can afford to trust. No one to back
me up.

Three miles to the hills. I kept to the starlit back streets, listening
and looking around. The gun was in my hand. I meant to keep it there. I
could hear dogs barking and snarling, fighting somewhere not far away.

I was in a cold sweat. I had never been more terrified in my life. Yet
nothing attacked me. Nothing found me.

I didn't go all the way to the hills. Instead I found a burned out,
unwalled house a few blocks before the end of Meredith Street. Fear of
dogs had made me keep an eye open for anything that might provide
shelter.

The house was a ruin, a plundered ruin. It wasn't safe to walk into with
or without a light. It was a roofless collection of upright black bones.
But it had been built up off the ground. Five concrete steps led up to
what had been the front porch. There should be a way under the house.

What if other people were under it?

I walked around it, listening, trying to see. Then, instead of daring to
crawl under, I settled in what was left of the attached garage. A corner
of it was still standing, and there was enough rubble in front of that
corner to conceal me if I didn't show a light. Also, if I were
surprised, I could get out of the garage faster than I could crawl out
from under a house. The concrete floor could not collapse under me as
the wooden floor might in what was left of the house proper. It was as
good as I was going to get, and I was exhausted. I didn't know whether I
could sleep, but I had to rest.

Morning now. What shall I do? I did sleep a little, but I kept startling
awake. Every sound woke me---the wind, rats, insects, then squirrels,
and birds. ... I don't feel rested, but I'm a little less exhausted. So
what shall I do?

How is it that we had never established an outside meeting
place---somewhere where the family could reunite after disaster. I
remember suggesting to Dad that we do that, but he had never done
anything about it, and I hadn't pushed the idea as I should have. (Poor
Godshaping. Lack of forethought.)

*What now!*

Now, I have to go home. I don't want to. The idea scares me to death.
It's taken me a long time just to write the word: Home. But I have to
know about my brothers, and about Cory and Curtis. I don't know how I
can help if they're hurt or being held by someone. I don't know what
might be waiting for me back at the neighborhood. More painted faces?
The police? I'm in trouble either way. If the police are there, I'll
have to hide my gun before I go in---my gun, and my small amount of
money. Carrying a gun can win you a lot of unwanted attention from the
police if you catch them in the wrong mood. Yet everyone who has one
carries it. The trick, of course, is not to get caught carrying it.

On the other hand, if the painted faces are still there, I can't go in
at all. How long do those people stay high on pyro and fire? Do they
hang around after their fun to steal whatever's left and maybe kill a
few more people?

No matter. I have to go and see.

I have to go home.

Saturday, July 31, 2027---Evening

I have to write. I don't know what else to do. The others are asleep
now, but it isn't dark. I'm on watch because I couldn't sleep if I
tried. I'm jittery and crazed. I can't cry. I want to get up and just
run and run. ... Run away from everything. But there isn't any away.

I have to write. There's nothing familiar left to me but the writing.
God is Change. I hate God. I have to write.

There were no unburned houses back in the neighborhood, although some
were burned worse than others. I don't know whether police or
firefighters ever came. If they had come, they were gone when I got
there. The neighborhood was wide open and crawling with scavengers.

I stood at the gate, staring in as strangers picked among the black
bones of our homes. The ruins were still smoking, but men, women, and
children were all over them, digging through them, picking fruit from
the trees, stripping our dead, quarreling or fighting over new
acquisitions, stashing things away in clothing or bundles. ... Who were
these people?

I put my hand on the gun in my pocket---it had four rounds left in
it---and I went in. I was grimy from lying in dirt and ashes all night.
I might not be noticed.

I saw three women from an unwalled part of Durant Road, digging through
what was left of the Yannis house. They were laughing and throwing
around chunks of wood and plaster.

Where were Shani Yannis and her daughters? Where were her sisters?

I walked through the neighborhood, looking past the human maggots,
trying to find some of the people I had grown up with. I found dead
ones. Edwin Dunn lay where he had when I took his gun, but now he was
shirtless and shoeless. His pockets had been turned out.

The ground was littered with ash-covered corpses, some burned or half
blown apart by automatic weapons fire. Dried or nearly dried blood had
pooled in the street. Two men were prying loose our emergency bell. The
bright, clear, early morning sunlight made the whole scene less real
somehow, more nightmarelike. I stopped in front of our house and stared
at the five adults and the child who were picking through the ruins of
it. Who were these vultures? Did the fire draw them? Is that what the
street poor do? Run to fire and hope to find a corpse to strip?

There was a dead green face on our front porch. I went up the steps and
stood looking at him---at her. The green face was a woman---tall, lean,
bald, but female. And what had she died for? What was the point of all
this?

"Leave her alone." A woman who had a pair of Cory's shoes in her hand
strode up to me. "She died for all of us. Leave her alone."

I've never in my life wanted more to kill another human being. "Get the
hell out of my way," I said. I didn't raise my voice. I don't know how I
looked, but the thief backed away.

I stepped over the green face and went into the carcass of our home. The
other thieves looked at me, but none of them said anything. One pair, I
noticed, was a man with a small boy. The man was dressing the boy in a
pair of my brother Gregory's jeans. The jeans were much too big, but the
man belted them and rolled them up.

And where was Gregory, my clownish smartass of a baby brother? Where was
he? Where was everyone?

The roof of our house had fallen in. Most things had burned---kitchen,
living room, dining room, my room. ... The floor wasn't safe to walk on.
I saw one of the scavengers fall through, give a surprised yell, then
climb, unhurt, onto a floor joist.

Nothing left in my room could be salvaged. Ashes. A heat-distorted metal
bedframe, the broken metal and ceramic remains of my lamp, bunches of
ashes that had been clothing or books. Many books were not burned
through. They were useless, but they had been packed so tightly together
that the fire had burned in deeply from the edges and the spines. Rough
circles of unhurried paper remained, surrounded by ash. I didn't find a
single whole page.

The back two bedrooms had survived better. That was where the scavengers
were, and where I headed.

I found bundled pairs of my father's socks, folded shorts and T-shirts,
and an extra holster that I could use for the .45. All this I found in
or under the unpromising-looking remains of Dad's chest of drawers. Most
things were burned beyond use, but I stuffed the best of what I found
into my pack. The man with the child came over to scavenge beside me,
and somehow, perhaps because of the child, because this stranger in his
filthy rags was someone's father, too, I didn't mind. The little boy
watched the two of us, his small brown face expressionless. He did look
a little like Gregory.

I dug a dried apricot out of my pack and held it out to him. He couldn't
have been more than six, but he wouldn't touch the food until the man
told him to. Good discipline. But at the man's nod, he snatched the
apricot, bit off a tiny taste, then stuffed the rest into his mouth
whole.

So, in company with five strangers, I plundered my family's home. The
ammunition under the closet floor in my parents' room had burned, had no
doubt exploded. The closet was badly charred. So much for the money
hidden there.

I took dental floss, soap, and a jar of petroleum jelly from my parents'
bathroom. Everything else was already gone.

I managed to gather one set of outer clothing each for Cory and my
brothers. In particular, I found shoes for them. There was a woman
scavenging among Marcus's shoes, and she glared at me, but she kept
quiet. My brothers had run out of the house in their pajamas. Cory had
thrown on a coat. I had been the last to get out of the house because I
had risked stopping to grab jeans, a sweatshirt, and shoes as well as my
emergency pack. I could have been killed. If I had thought about what I
was doing, if I had had to think, no doubt I would have been killed. I
reacted the way I had trained myself to react---though my training was
far from up to date---more memory than anything else. I hadn't practiced
late at night for ages. Yet my self-administered training had worked.

Now, if I could get these clothes to Cory and my brothers, I might be
able to make up for their lack of training. Especially if I could get
the money under the rocks by the lemon tree.

I put clothes and shoes into a salvaged pillow case, looked around for
blankets, and couldn't find a one. They must have been grabbed early.
All the more reason to get the lemon-tree money.

I went out to the peach tree, and, being tall, managed to reach a couple
of nearly-ripe peaches that other scavengers had missed. Then I looked
around as though for something more to take, and surprised myself by
almost crying at the sight of Cory's big, well-tended back garden,
trampled into the ground. Peppers, tomatoes, squashes, carrots,
cucumbers, lettuce, melons, sunflowers, beans, corn. ... Much of it
wasn't ripe yet, but what hadn't been stolen had been destroyed.

I scavenged a few carrots, a couple of handfuls of sunflower seeds from
flower heads that lay on the ground, and a few bean pods from vines Cory
had planted to run up the sunflower stalks and corn plants. I took what
was left the way I thought a late-arriving scavenger would. And I worked
my way toward the lemon tree. When I reached it, heavy with little green
lemons, I hunted for any with even a hint of paling, of yellow. I took a
few from the tree, and from the ground. Cory had planted shade-loving
flowers at the base of the tree, and they had thrived there. She and my
father had scattered small, rounded boulders among these in a way that
seemed no more than decorative. A few of these had been turned over,
crushing the flowers near them. In fact, the rock with the money under
it had been turned over. But the two or three inches of dirt over the
money packet, triple wrapped and heat-sealed in plastic, was
undisturbed.

I snatched the packet in no more time than it had taken to pick up a
couple of lemons a moment before. First I spotted the hiding place, then
I snatched up the money packet along with a hand full of dirt. Then,
eager to leave, but terrified of drawing attention to myself, I picked
up a few more lemons and hunted around for more food.

The figs were hard and green instead of purple, and the persimmons were
yellow-green instead of orange. I found a single ear of corn left on a
downed stalk and used it to stuff the money packet deeper into my
blanket pack. Then I left.

With my pack on my back and the pillow case in my left arm, resting on
my hip like a baby, I walked down the driveway to the street. I kept my
right hand free for the gun still in my pocket. I had not taken time to
put on the holster.

There were more people within the walls than there had been when I
arrived. I had to walk past most of them to get out. Others were leaving
with their loads, and I tried to follow them without quite attaching
myself to any particular group. This meant that I moved more slowly than
I would have chosen to. I had time to look at the corpses and see what I
didn't want to see.

Richard Moss, stark naked, lying in a pool of his own blood. His house,
closer to the gate than ours, had been burned to the ground. Only the
chimney stuck up blackened and naked from the rubble. Where were his two
surviving wives Karen and Zahra? Or had they survived? Where were all
his many children?

Little Robin Baiter, naked, filthy, bloody between her legs, cold, bony,
barely pubescent. Yet she might have married my brother Marcus someday.
She might have been my sister. She had always been such a bright, sharp,
great little kid, all serious and knowing. Twelve going on thirty-five,
Cory used to say. She always smiled when she said it.

Russell Dory, Robin's grandfather. Only his shoes had been taken. His
body had been almost torn apart by automatic weapons fire. An old man
and a child. What had the painted faces gotten for all their killing?

"She died for us," the scavenger woman had said of the green face. Some
kind of insane burn-the-rich movement, Keith had said. We've never been
rich, but to the desperate, we looked rich. We were surviving and we had
our wall. Did our community die so that addicts could make a help the
poor political statement?

There were other corpses. I didn't get a close look at most of them.
They littered the front yards, the street, and the island. There was no
sign of our emergency bell now. The men who had wanted it had carried it
away---perhaps to be sold for its metal.

I saw Layla Yannis, Shani's oldest daughter. Like Robin, she had been
raped. I saw Michael Talcott, one side of his head smashed in. I didn't
look around for Curtis. I was terrified that I might see him lying
nearby. I was almost out of control as it was, and I couldn't draw
attention to myself. I couldn't be anything more than another scavenger
hauling away treasure.

Bodies passed under my eyes: Jeremy Baiter, one of Robin's brothers,
Philip Moss, George Hsu, his wife and his oldest son, Juana Montoya,
Rubin Quintanilla, Lidia Cruz. ... Lidia was only eight years old. She
had been raped, too.

I made it back through the gate. I didn't break down. I hadn't seen Cory
or my brothers in the carnage. That didn't mean they weren't there, but
I hadn't seen them. They might be alive. Curtis might be alive. Where
could I look for them?

The Talcotts had relatives living in Robledo, but I didn't know where.
Somewhere on the other side of River Street. I couldn't look for them,
though Curtis might have gone to them. Why hadn't anyone else stayed to
salvage what they could?

I circled the neighborhood, keeping the wall in sight, then made a
greater circle. I saw no one---or at least no one I knew. I saw other
street poor who stared at me.

Then because I didn't know what else to do, I headed back toward my
burned out garage on Meredith Street. I couldn't call the police. All
the phones I knew of were slag. No strangers would let me use their
phone if they had phones, and I didn't know anyone whom I could pay to
call and trust to make the call. Most people would avoid me or be
tempted to keep my money and never call. And anyway, if the police have
ignored what's been done to my neighborhood so far, if such a fire and
so many corpses can be ignored, why should I go to them? What would they
do? Arrest me? Take my cash as their fee? I wouldn't be surprised. Best
to stay clear of them.

But *where* was my family!

Someone called my name.

I turned around, my hand in my pocket, and saw Zahra Moss and Harry
Baiter---Richard Moss's youngest wife and Robin Baiter's oldest brother.
They were an unlikely pair, but they were definitely together. They
managed, without touching each other, to give the appearance of all but
clinging together. Both were blood-spattered and ragged. I looked at
Harry's battered swollen face and remembered that Joanne had loved
him---or thought she had---and that he wouldn't marry her and go with
her to Olivar because he believed what Dad believed about Olivar.

"Are you all right?" he asked me.

I nodded, remembering Robin. Did he know? Russell Dory, Robin, and
Jeremy. ... "They beat you up?" I asked, feeling stupid and awkward. I
didn't want to tell him his grandfather, brother, and sister were dead.

"I had to fight my way out last night. I was lucky they didn't shoot
me." He swayed, looked around. "Let's sit on the curb."

Both Zahra and I looked around, made sure no one else was near by. We
sat with Harry between us. I sat on my pillowcase of clothing. Zahra and
Harry were fully dressed, in spite of their coating of blood and dirt,
but they carried nothing. Did they have nothing, or had they left their
things somewhere---perhaps with whatever was left of their families. And
where was Zahra's little girl Bibi? Did she know that Richard Moss was
dead?

"Everyone's dead," Zahra whispered as though speaking into my thoughts.
"Everyone. Those painted bastards killed them all!"

"No!" Harry shook his head. "We got out. There'll be some others." He
sat with his face in his hands, and I wondered whether he was more hurt
than I had thought. I wasn't sharing any serious pain with him.

"Have either of you seen my brothers or Cory?" I asked.

"Dead," Zahra whispered. "Like my Bibi. All dead."

I jumped. "No! Not all of them. No! Did you see them?"

"I saw most of the Montoya family," Harry said. He wasn't talking to me
as much as musing aloud. "We saw them last night. They said Juana was
dead. The rest of them were going to walk to Glendale where their
relatives live."

"But---" I began.

"And I saw Laticia Hsu. She had been stabbed forty or fifty times."

"But did you see my brothers?" I had to ask.

"They're all dead, I told you," Zahra said. "They got out, but the
paints caught them and dragged them back and killed them. I saw. One of
them had me down, and he ... I saw."

She was being raped when she saw my family dragged back and killed? Was
that what she meant? Was it true?

"I went back this morning," I said. "I didn't see their bodies. Didn't
see any of them." Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. ...

"I saw. Your mother. All of them. I saw." Zahra hugged herself. "I
didn't want to see, but I saw."

We all sat without talking. I don't know how long we sat there. Now and
then someone walked past us and looked at us, some dirty, ragged person
with bundles. Cleaner people in little bunches rode past us on bikes. A
group of three rode past on motorcycles, their electric hum and whine
strange in the quiet street.

When I got up, the other two looked at me. For no reason except habit, I
picked up my pillowcase. I don't know what I meant to do with the things
in it. It had occurred to me, though, that I should get back to my
garage before someone else settled there. I wasn't thinking very well.
It was as though that garage was home now, and all I wanted in the world
was to be there.

Harry got up and almost fell down again. He bent and threw up into the
gutter. The sight of his throwing up grabbed at me, and I only just
managed to look away in time to avoid joining him. He finished, spat,
turned to face Zahra and me, and coughed.

"I feel like hell," he said.

"They hit him in the head last night," Zahra explained. "He got me away
from the guy who was ... Well, you know. He got me away, but they hurt
him."

"There's a burned out garage where I slept last night," I said. "It's a
long walk, but he can rest there. We can all rest there."

Zahra took my pillowcase and carried it. Maybe something in it could do
her some good. We walked on either side of Harry and kept him from
stopping or wandering off or staggering too much. Somehow, we got him to
the garage.

**Kindness eases Change**

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Sunday, August 1, 2027

H[ARRY SLEPT MOST OF]{.small} the day today Zahra and I took turns
staying with him. He has a concussion, at least, and he needs time to
heal. We haven't talked about what we'll do if he gets sicker instead of
healing. Zahra doesn't want to abandon him because he fought to save
her. I don't want to abandon him because I've known him all my life.
He's a good guy. I wonder if there's some way to get in touch with the
Garfields. They would give him a home, or at least see that he has
medical care.

But he doesn't seem to be getting worse. He totters out to the fenced
back yard to urinate. He eats the food and drinks the water that I give
him. With no need for discussion, we're eating and drinking sparingly
from my supplies. They're all we have. Soon we'll have to risk going out
to buy more. But today, Sunday, is a day of rest and healing for us.

The pain of Harry's headache and his bruised, beaten body are almost
welcome to me. They're distractions. Along with Zahra's talking and
crying for her dead daughter, they fill my mind.

Their misery eases my own, somehow. It gives me moments when I don't
think about my family. Everyone is dead. But how can they be? Everyone?

Zahra has a soft, little-girl voice that I used to think was phony. It's
real, but it takes on a sandpaper roughness when she's upset. It sounds
painful, as though it's abrading her throat as she speaks.

She had seen her daughter killed, seen the blue face who shot Bibi as
Zahra ran, carrying her. She believed the blue face was enjoying
himself, shooting at all the moving targets. She said his expression
reminded her of a man having sex.

"I fell down," she whispered. "I thought I was dead. I thought he had
killed me. There was blood. Then I saw Bibi's head drop to one side. A
red face grabbed her from me. I didn't see where he came from. He
grabbed her and threw her into the Hsu house. The house was burning
everywhere. He threw her into the fire.

"I went crazy then. I don't know what I did. Somebody grabbed me, then I
was free, then somebody shoved me down and fell on me. I couldn't get my
breath, and he tore my clothes. Then he was on me, and I couldn't do
anything. That's when I saw your mother, your brothers. ...

"Then Harry was there, and he pulled the bastard off me. He told me
later that I was screaming. I don't know what I was doing. He was
beating up the guy he'd pulled off me when a new guy jumped him. I hit
the new guy with a rock and Harry knocked the other one out. Then we got
away. We just ran. We didn't sleep. We hid between two unwalled houses
down the street away from the fire until a guy came out with an ax and
chased us away. Then we just wandered until we found you. We didn't even
really know each other before. You know, Richard never wanted us to have
much to do with the neighbors---especially the white ones."

I nodded, remembering Richard Moss. "He's dead, you know," I said. "I
saw him." I wanted to take the words back as soon as I'd said them. I
didn't know how to tell someone her husband was dead, but there must be
a better, gentler way than that.

She stared at me, stricken. I wanted to apologize for my bluntness, but
I didn't think it would help. I'm sorry, I said in a kind of generic
apology for everything. She began to cry, and I repeated, "I'm sorry."

I held her and let her cry. Harry woke up, drank a little water, and
listened while Zahra told how Richard Moss had bought her from her
homeless mother when she was only fifteen---younger than I had
thought---and brought her to live in the first house she had ever known.
He gave her enough to eat and didn't beat her, and even when her
co-wives were hateful to her, it was a thousand times better than living
outside with her mother and starving. Now she was outside again. In six
years, she had gone from nothing to nothing.

"Do you have someplace to go?" she asked us at last. "Do you know
anybody who still has a house?"

I looked at Harry. "You might be able to get into Olivar if you can walk
there from here. The Garfields would take you in."

He thought about that for a while. "I don't want to," he said. "I don't
think there's any more future in Olivar than there was in our
neighborhood. But at least in our neighborhood, we had the guns."

"For all the good it did us," Zahra muttered.

"I know. But they were our guns, not hired gunmen. No one could turn
them against us. In Olivar, from what Joanne said, no one's allowed to
have a gun except the security force. And who the hell are they?"

"Company people," I said. "People from outside Olivar."

He nodded. "That's what I heard, too. Maybe it will be all right, but it
doesn't sound all right."

"It sounds better than starving," Zahra said. "You guys have never
missed a meal, have you?"

"I'm going north," I said. "I planned to go anyway once my family was
back on its feet. Now I have no family, and I'm going."

"North where?" Zahra demanded.

"Up toward Canada. The way things are now, I may not be able to get that
far. But I'll get to a place where water doesn't cost more than food,
and where work brings a salary. Even a small one. I'm not going to spend
my life as some kind of twenty-first century slave."

"North is where I'm headed, too," Harry said. "There's nothing here.
I've tried for over a year to get a job here---any job that pays money.
There's nothing. I want to work for money and get some college. The only
jobs that pay serious money are the kind our parents had, the kind that
require college degrees."

I looked at him, wanting to ask something, hesitating, plunging. "Harry,
what about your parents?"

"I don't know," he said. "I didn't see them killed. Zahra says she
didn't. I don't know where anyone is. We got separated."

I swallowed. "I didn't see your parents," I said, "but I did see some of
your other relatives---dead."

"Who?" he demanded.

I guess there really isn't any way to tell people that their close
relatives are dead except to say it---no matter how much you don't want
to. "Your grandfather," I said, "and Jeremy and Robin."

"Robin and Jeremy? Kids? Little kids?"

Zahra took his hand. "They kill little kids," she said. "Out here in the
world, they kill kids every day."

He didn't cry. Or maybe he cried when we were asleep. First, though, he
closed himself up, stopped talking, stopped responding, stopped doing
anything until it was nearly dark. By then, Zahra had gone out and come
back with my brother Bennett's shirt full of ripe peaches.

"Don't ask me where I got them," she said.

"I assume you stole them," I said. "Not from anyone around here, I hope.
No sense making the neighbors mad."

She lifted an eyebrow. "I don't need you to tell me how to live out
here. I was born out here. Eat your peaches."

I ate four of them. They were delicious, and too ripe to travel well
anyway.

"Why don't you try on some of those clothes," I said. "Take what fits
you." She fit not only into Marcus's shirt and jeans---though she had to
roll the jeans legs up---but into his shoes. Shoes are expensive. Now
she has two pair.

"You let me do it, I'll trade these little shoes for some food," she
said.

I nodded. "Tomorrow. Whatever you get, we'll split it. Then I'm
leaving."

"Going north?"

"Yes."

"Just north. Do you know anything about the roads and towns and where to
buy stuff or steal it? Have you got money?"

"I have maps," I said. "They're old, but I think they're still good. No
one's been building new roads lately."

"Hell no. Money?"

"A little. Not enough, I suspect."

"No such thing as enough money. What about him?" She gestured toward
Harry's unmoving back. He was lying down. I couldn't tell whether he was
asleep or not.

"He has to decide for himself," I said. "Maybe he wants to hang around
to look for his family before he goes."

He turned over slowly. He looked sick, but fully aware. Zahra put the
peaches she had saved for him next to him.

"I don't want to wait for anything," he said. "I wish we could start
now. I hate this place."

"You going with her?" Zahra asked, jabbing a thumb at me.

He looked at me. "We might be able to help each other," he said. "At
least we know each other, and ... I managed to grab a few hundred
dollars as I ran out of the house." He was offering trust. He meant we
could trust each other. That was no small thing.

"I was thinking of traveling as a man," I said to him.

He seemed to be repressing a smile. "That will be safer for you. You're
at least tall enough to fool people. You'll have to cut your hair,
though."

Zahra grunted. "Mixed couples catch hell whether people think they're
gay or straight. Harry'll piss off all the blacks and you'll piss off
all the whites. Good luck."

I watched her as she said it, and realized what she wasn't saying. "You
want to come?" I asked.

She sniffed. "Why should I? I won't cut my hair!"

"No need," I said. "We can be a black couple and their white friend. If
Harry can get a reasonable tan, maybe we can claim him as a cousin."

She hesitated, then whispered, "Yeah, I want to go." And she started to
cry. Harry stared at her in surprise.

"Did you think we were going to just dump you?" I asked. "All you had to
do was let us know."

"I don't have any money," she said. "Not a dollar."

I sighed. "Where did you get those peaches?"

"You were right. I stole them."

"You have a useful skill then, and information about living out here." I
faced Harry. "What do you think?"

"Her stealing doesn't bother you?" he asked.

"I mean to survive," I said.

"'Thou shalt not steal,'" he quoted. "Years and years---a lifetime of
'Thou shalt not steal.'"

I had to smother a flash of anger before I could answer. He wasn't my
father. He had no business quoting scripture at me. He was nobody. I
didn't look at him. I didn't speak until I knew my voice would sound
normal. Then, "I said I mean to survive," I told him. "Don't you?"

He nodded. "It wasn't a criticism. I'm just surprised."

"I hope it won't ever mean getting caught or leaving someone else to
starve," I said. And to my own surprise, I smiled. "I've thought about
it. That's the way I feel, but I've never stolen anything."

"You're kidding!" Zahra said.

I shrugged. "It's true. I grew up trying to set a good example for my
brothers and trying to live up to my father's expectations. That seemed
like what I should be doing."

"Oldest kid," Harry said. "I know." He was the oldest in his family.

"Oldest, hell," Zahra said, laughing. "You're both babies out here."

And that wasn't offensive, somehow. Perhaps because it was true. "I'm
inexperienced," I admitted. "But I can learn. You're going to be one of
my teachers."

"One?" she said. "Who have you got but me?"

"Everyone."

She looked scornful. "No one."

"Everyone who's surviving out here knows things that I need to know," I
said. "I'll watch them, I'll listen to them, I'll learn from them. If I
don't, I'll be killed. And like I said, I intend to survive."

"They'll sell you a bowl of shit," she said.

I nodded. "I know. But I'll buy as few of those as possible."

She looked at me for a long time, then sighed. "I wish I'd known you
better before all this happened," she said. "You're a weird preacher's
kid. If you still want to play man, I'll cut your hair for you."

Monday, August 2, 2027

(from notes expanded [SUNDAY, AUGUST]{.small} 8)

We're on our way.

This morning Zahra took us to Hanning Joss, the biggest secure store
complex in Robledo. We could get all we needed there. Hanning vendors
sell everything from gourmet food to debusing cream, prostheses to
homebirthing kits, guns to the latest in touchrings, headsets, and
recordings. I could have spent days just wandering through the aisles,
staring at the stuff I couldn't afford. I had never been to Hanning
before, had never seen anything like it in person.

But we had to go into the complex one at a time, leaving two outside to
guard our bundles---including my gun. Hanning, as I had heard many times
on the radio, was one of the safest places in the city. If you didn't
like their sniffers, metal detectors, package restrictions, armed
guards, and willingness to strip-search anyone they thought was
suspicious on the way in or out, you could shop somewhere else. The
store was full of people eager to put up with the inconvenience and
invasion of privacy if only they could buy the things they needed in
peace.

No one strip-searched me, though I was required to prove that I wasn't a
deadbeat.

"Show your Hanning disc or money," an armed guard demanded at the
massive gates. I was terrified that he would steal my money, but I
showed the bills that I intended to spend, and he nodded. He never
touched them. No doubt we were both being watched, and our behaviors
recorded. Such a security conscious store wouldn't want its guards
stealing the customers' money.

"Shop in peace," the guard said with no hint of a smile.

I bought salt, a small tube of honey, and the cheapest of dried
foods---oats, fruit, nuts, bean flour, lentils, plus a little dried
beef---all that I thought Zahra and I could carry. And I bought more
water and a few odd items: water purification tablets---just in
case---and sun blocker, which even Zahra and I would need, some stuff
for insect bites, and an ointment Dad used for muscle aches. We would
have plenty of those. I bought more toilet paper, tampons, and lip balm.
I bought myself a new notebook, two more pens, and an expensive supply
of ammunition for the .45. I felt better once I had that.

I bought three of the cheap, multipurpose sleepsacks---big, tough
storage bags, and the preferred bedding of all the more affluent
homeless. The country was full of people who could earn or steal food
and water, but could not rent even a cot. These might sleep on the
street or in makeshift shacks, but if they could, they put a sleepsack
between their bodies and the ground. The sacks, with their own
strapping, fold to serve as packs during the day. They're light, tough,
and able to survive most abuse. They're warm even if you have to sleep
on the concrete, but they're thin---more useful than comfortable. Curtis
and I used to make love on a pallet of them.

And I bought three oversized jackets of the same thin, breathing
synthetic as the sleepsacks. They'll finish the job of keeping us warm
at night as we moved north. They look cheap and ugly, and that's good.
They might not be stolen.

That was the end of my money---the money I had packed in my emergency
pack. I haven't touched the money I took from the foot of the lemon
tree. That I had split in half and put in two of my father's socks. I
kept it pinned inside my jeans, invisible and unavailable to
pickpockets.

It isn't a lot of money, but it's more than I've ever had before---more
than anyone could expect me to have. I pinned it where it is, rewrapped
in plastic and secure in the socks on Saturday night when I had finished
writing and still couldn't stop thinking and remembering and knowing
there was nothing I could do about the past.

Then I had a kind of tactile memory of grabbing the money packet and a
handful of dirt and stuffing both into my pack. I had an incredible
amount of nervous energy that was spending itself in jitteriness. My
hands shook so that I could hardly find the money---by feel, in
darkness. I made it an exercise in concentration to find the money,
socks, and pins, divide the money in half, or as close to in half as I
could without seeing, put it into the socks, and pin it in place. I
checked it when I went out to urinate the next morning. I'd done a good
job. The pins didn't show at all on the outside. I'd put them through
the seams down near my ankles. Nothing dangling, no problems.

I took my many purchases out to what was once the ground floor of a
parking structure, and was now a kind of semienclosed flea market. Many
of the things dug out of ash heaps and landfills wind up for sale here.
The rule is that if you buy something in the store, you can sell
something of similar value in the structure. Your receipt, coded and
dated, is your peddler's license.

The structure was patrolled, though more to check these licenses than to
keep anyone safe. Still, the structure was safer than the street.

I found Harry and Zahra sitting on our bundles, Harry waiting to go into
the store, and Zahra waiting for her license. They had put their backs
against a wall of the store at a spot away from the street and away from
the biggest crowd of buyers and sellers. I gave Zahra the receipt and
began to separate and pack our new supplies. We would leave as soon as
Zahra and Harry finished their buying and selling.

We walked down to the freeway---the 118---and turned west. We would take
the 118 to the 23 and the 23 to U.S. 101. The 101 would take us up the
coast toward Oregon. We became part of a broad river of people walking
west on the freeway. Only a few straggled east against the
current---east toward the mountains and the desert. Where were the
westward walkers going? To something, or just away from here?

We saw a few trucks---most of them run at night---swarms of bikes or
electric cycles, and two cars. All these had plenty of room to speed
along the outer lanes past us. We're safer if we keep to the left lanes
away from the on and off ramps. It's against the law in California to
walk on the freeways, but the law is archaic. Everyone who walks walks
on the freeways sooner or later. Freeways provide the most direct routes
between cities and parts of cities. Dad walked or bicycled on them
often. Some prostitutes and peddlers of food, water, and other
necessities live along the freeways in sheds or shacks or in the open
air. Beggars, thieves, and murderers live here, too.

But I've never walked a freeway before today. I found the experience
both fascinating and frightening. In some ways, the scene reminded me of
an old film I saw once of a street in mid-twentieth-century
China---walkers, bicyclers, people carrying, pulling, pushing loads of
all kinds. But the freeway crowd is a heterogenous mass---black and
white, Asian and Latin, whole families are on the move with babies on
backs or perched atop loads in carts, wagons or bicycle baskets,
sometimes along with an old or handicapped person. Other old, ill, or
handicapped people hobbled along as best they could with the help of
sticks or fitter companions. Many were armed with sheathed knives,
rifles, and, of course, visible, holstered handguns. The occasional
passing cop paid no attention.

Children cried, played, squatted, did everything except eat. Almost no
one ate while walking. I saw a couple of people drink from canteens.
They took quick, furtive gulps, as though they were doing something
shameful---or something dangerous.

A woman alongside us collapsed. I got no impression of pain from her,
except at the sudden impact of her body weight on her knees. That made
me stumble, but not fall. The woman sat where she had fallen for a few
seconds, then lurched to her feet and began walking again, leaning
forward under her huge pack.

Almost everyone was filthy. Their bags and bundles and packs were
filthy. They stank. And we, who have slept on concrete in ashes and
dirt, and who have not bathed for three days---we fitted in pretty well.
Only our new sleepsack packs gave us away as either new to the road or
at least in possession of new stealables. We should have dirtied the
packs a little before we got started. We will dirty them tonight. I'll
see to it.

There were a few young guys around, lean and quick, some filthy, some
not dirty at all. Keiths. Today's Keiths. The ones who bothered me most
weren't carrying much. Some weren't carrying anything except weapons.

Predators. They looked around a lot, stared at people, and the people
looked away. I looked away. I was glad to see that Harry and Zahra did
the same. We didn't need trouble. If trouble came, I hoped we could kill
it and keep walking.

The gun was fully loaded now, and I wore it holstered, but half covered
by my shirt. Harry bought himself a knife. The money he had snatched up
as he ran from his burning house had not been enough to buy a gun. I
could have bought a second gun, but it would have taken too much of my
money, and we have a long way to go.

Zahra used the shoe money to buy herself a knife and a few personal
things. I had refused my share of that money. She needed a few dollars
in her pocket.

The day she and Harry use their knives, I hope they kill. If they don't,
I might have to, to escape the pain. And what will they think of that?

They deserve to know that I'm a sharer. For their own safety, they
should know. But I've never told anyone. Sharing is a weakness, a
shameful secret. A person who knows what I am can hurt me, betray me,
disable me with little effort.

I can't tell. Not yet. I'll have to tell soon, I know, but not yet.
We're together, the three of us, but we're not a unit yet. Harry and I
don't know Zahra very well, nor she us. And none of us know what will
happen when we're challenged. A racist challenge might force us apart. I
want to trust these people. I like them, and ... they're all I have
left. But I need more time to decide. It's no small thing to commit
yourself to other people.

"You okay?" Zahra asked.

I nodded.

"You look like hell. And you're so damned poker-faced most of the time.
..."

"Just thinking," I said. "There's so much to think about now."

She sighed her breath out in a near whistle. "Yeah. I know. But keep
your eyes open. You get too wrapped up in your thinking, and you'll miss
things. People get killed on freeways all the time."

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Monday, August 2, 2027

(cont. from notes expanded [AUGUST]{.small} 8)

Here are some of the things I've learned today:

Walking hurts. I've never done enough walking to learn that before, but
I know it now. It isn't only the blisters and sore feet, although we've
got those. After a while, everything hurts. I think my back and
shoulders would like to desert to another body. Nothing eases the pain
except rest. Even though we got a late start, we stopped twice today to
rest. We went off the freeway, into the hills or bushes to sit down,
drink water, eat dried fruit and nuts. Then we went on. The days are
long this time of year.

Sucking on a plum or apricot pit all day makes you feel less thirsty.
Zahra told us that.

"When I was a kid," she said, "there were times when I would put a
little rock in my mouth. Anything to feel better. It's a cheat, though.
If you don't drink enough water, you'll die no matter how you feel."

All three of us walked along with seeds in our mouths after our first
stop, and we felt better. We drank only during our stops in the hills.
It's safer that way.

Also, cold camps are safer than cheery campfires. Yet tonight we cleared
some ground, dug into a hillside, and made a small fire in the hollow.
There we cooked some of my acorn meal with nuts and fruit. It was
wonderful. Soon we'll run out of it and we'll have to survive on beans,
cornmeal, oats---expensive stuff from stores. Acorns are home-food, and
home is gone.

Fires are illegal. You can see them flickering all over the hills, but
they are illegal. Everything is so dry that there's always a danger of
campfires getting away from people and taking out a community or two. It
does happen. But people who have no homes will build fires. Even people
like us who know what fire can do will build them. They give comfort,
hot food, and a false sense of security.

While we were eating, and even after we'd finished, people drifted over
and tried to join us. Most were harmless and easily gotten rid of. Three
claimed they just wanted to get warm. The sun was still up, red on the
horizon, and it was far from cold.

Three women wanted to know whether two studs like Harry and me didn't
need more than one woman. The women who asked this may have been cold,
considering how few clothes they had on. It's going to be strange for
me, pretending to be a man.

"Couldn't I just roast this potato in your coals?" an old man asked,
showing us a withered potato.

We gave him some fire and sent him away---and watched to see where he
went, since a burning brand could be either a weapon or a major
distraction if he had friends hiding. It's crazy to live this way,
suspecting helpless old people. Insane. But we need our paranoia to keep
us alive. Hell, Harry wanted to let the old guy sit with us. It took
Zahra and me together to let him know that wasn't going to happen. Harry
and I have been well-fed and protected all our lives. We're strong and
healthy and better educated than most people our age. But we're stupid
out here. We want to trust people. I fight against the impulse. Harry
hasn't learned to do that yet. We argued about it afterward, low voiced,
almost whispering.

"Nobody's safe," Zahra told him. "No matter how pitiful they look, they
can steal you naked. Little kids, skinny and big-eyed will make off with
all your money, water, and food! I know. I used to do it to people.
Maybe they died, I don't know. But I didn't die."

Harry and I both stared at her. We knew so little about her life. But to
me, at that moment, Harry was our most dangerous question mark.

"You're strong and confident," I said to him. "You think you can take
care of yourself out here, and maybe you can. But think what a stab
wound or a broken bone would mean out here: Disablement, slow death from
infection or starvation, no medical care, nothing."

He looked at me as though he wasn't sure he wanted to know me anymore.
"What, then?" he asked. "Everyone's guilty until proven innocent? Guilty
of what? And how do they prove themselves to you?"

"I don't give a piss whether they're innocent or not," Zahra said. "Let
them tend to their own business."

"Harry, your mind is still back in the neighborhood," I said. "You still
think a mistake is when your father yells at you or you break a finger
or chip a tooth or something. Out here a mistake---one mistake---and you
may be dead. Remember that guy today? What if that happened to us?"

We had seen a man robbed---a chubby guy of 35 or 40 who was walking
along eating nuts out of a paper bag. Not smart. A little kid of 12 or
13 snatched the nuts and ran off with them. While the victim was
distracted by the little kid, two bigger kids tripped him, cut his pack
straps, dragged the pack off his back, and ran off with it. The whole
thing happened so fast that no one could have interfered if they'd
wanted to. No one tried. The victim was unhurt except for bruises and
abrasions---the sort of thing I had to put up with every day back in the
neighborhood. But the victim's supplies were gone. If he had a home
nearby and other supplies, he would be all right. Otherwise, his only
way of surviving might be to rob someone else---if he could.

"Remember?" I asked Harry. "We don't have to hurt anyone unless they
push us into it, but we don't dare let our guard down. We can't trust
people."

Harry shook his head. "What if I thought that way when I pulled that guy
off Zahra?"

I held on to my temper. "Harry, you know I don't mean we shouldn't trust
or help each other. We know each other. We've made a commitment to
travel together."

"I'm not sure we do know each other."

"I am. And we can't afford your denial. You can't afford it."

He just stared at me.

"Out here, you adapt to your surroundings or you get killed," I said.
"That's obvious!"

Now he did look at me as though I were a stranger. I looked back, hoping
I knew him as well as I thought I did. He had a brain and he had
courage. He just didn't want to change.

"Do you want to break off with us," Zahra asked, "go your own way
without us?"

His gaze softened as he looked at her. "No," he said. "Of course not.
But we don't have to turn into animals, for godsake."

"In a way, we do," I said. "We're a pack, the three of us, and all those
other people out there aren't in it. If we're a good pack, and we work
together, we have a chance. You can be sure we aren't the only pack out
here."

He leaned back against a rock, and said with amazement, "You damn sure
talk macho enough to be a guy."

I almost hit him. Maybe Zahra and I would be better off without him. But
no, that wasn't true. Numbers mattered. Friendship mattered. One real
male presence mattered.

"Don't repeat that," I whispered, leaning close to him. "Never say that
again. There are other people all over these hills; you don't know who's
listening. You give me away and you weaken yourself!"

That reached him. "Sorry," he said.

"It's bad out here," Zahra said. "But most people make it if they're
careful. People weaker than us make it---if they're careful."

Harry gave a wan smile. "I hate this world already," he said.

"It's not so bad if people stick together."

He looked from her to me and back to her again. He smiled at her and
nodded. It occurred to me then that he liked her, was attracted to her.
That could be a problem for her later. She was a beautiful woman, and I
would never be beautiful---which didn't bother me. Boys had always
seemed to like me. But Zahra's looks grabbed male attention. If she and
Harry get together, she could wind up carrying two heavy loads
northward.

I was lost in thought about the two of them when Zahra nudged me with
her foot.

Two big, dirty-looking guys were standing nearby, watching us, watching
Zahra in particular.

I stood up, feeling the others stand with me, flanking me. These guys
were too close to us. They meant to be too close. As I stood up, I put
my hand on the gun.

"Yeah?" I said. "What do you want?"

"Not a thing," one of them said, smiling at Zahra. Both wore big
holstered knives which they fingered.

I drew the gun. "Good deal," I said.

Their smiles vanished. "What, you going to shoot us for standing here?"
the talkative one said.

I thumbed the safety. I would shoot the talker, the leader. The other
one would run away. He already wanted to run away. He was staring,
open-mouthed, at the gun. By the time I collapsed, he would be gone.

"Hey, no trouble!" the talker raised his hands, backing away. "Take it
easy, man."

I let them go. I think it would have been better to shoot them. I'm
afraid of guys like that---guys looking for trouble, looking for
victims. But it seems I can't quite shoot someone just because I'm
afraid of him. I killed a man on the night of the fire, and I haven't
thought much about it. But this was different. It was like what Harry
said about stealing. I've heard, "Thou shalt not kill," all my life, but
when you have to, you kill. I wonder what Dad would say about that. But
then, he was the one who taught me to shoot.

"We'd better keep a damn good watch tonight," I said. I looked at Harry,
and was glad to see that he looked the way I probably had a moment
before: mad and worried. "Let's pass your watch and my gun around," I
told him. "Three hours per watcher."

"You would have done it, wouldn't you?" he asked. It sounded like a real
question.

I nodded. "Wouldn't you?"

"Yes. I wouldn't have wanted to, but those guys were out for fun. Their
idea of fun, anyway." He glanced at Zahra. He had pulled one man off
her, and taken a beating for it. Maybe the obvious threat to her would
keep him alert. Anything that would keep him alert couldn't be all bad.

I looked at Zahra, kept my voice very low. "You never went shooting with
us, so I have to ask. Do you know how to use this?"

"Yeah," she said. "Richard let his older kids go out, but he wouldn't
let me. Before he bought me, though, I was a good shot."

Her alien past again. It distracted me for a moment. I had been waiting
to ask her how much a person costs these days. And she had been sold by
her mother to a man who couldn't have been much more than a stranger. He
could have been a maniac, a monster. And my father used to worry about
future slavery or debt slavery. Had he known? He couldn't have.

"Have you used a gun like this before?" I asked. I reengaged the safety
and handed it to her.

"Hell, yeah," she said, examining it. "I like this. It's heavy, but if
you shoot somebody with it, they go down." She released the clip,
checked it, reinserted it, rammed it home, and handed it back. "I wish I
could have practiced with you all," she said. "I always wanted to."

Without warning, I felt a pang of loneliness for the burned
neighborhood. It was almost a physical pain. I had been desperate to
leave it, but I had expected it still to be there---changed, but
surviving. Now that it was gone, there were moments when I couldn't
imagine how I was going to survive without it.

"You guys get some sleep," I said. "I'm too wound up to sleep now. I'll
take the first watch."

"We should gather more wood for the fire first," Harry said. "It's
burning low."

"Let it go out," I said. "It's a spotlight on us, and it messes up our
night vision. Other people can see us long before we see them."

"And sit here in the dark," he said. It wasn't a protest. At worst, it
was grudging agreement. "I'll take the watch after you," he said, lying
back and pulling up his sleepsack and positioning the rest of his gear
to serve as a pillow. As an afterthought, he took off his wrist watch
and gave it to me. "It was a gift from my mother," he said.

"You know I'll take care of it," I told him.

He nodded. "You be careful," he said, and closed his eyes.

I put the watch on, pulled the elastic of my sleeve down over it so that
the glow of the dial wouldn't be visible by accident, and sat back
against the hill to make a few quick notes. While there was still some
natural light, I could write and watch.

Zahra watched me for a while, then laid her hand on my arm. "Teach me to
do that," she whispered.

I looked at her, not understanding.

"Teach me to read and write."

I was surprised, but I shouldn't have been. Where, in a life like hers,
had there been time or money for school. And once Richard Moss bought
her, her jealous co-wives wouldn't have taught her.

"You should have come to us back in the neighborhood," I said. "We would
have set up lessons for you."

"Richard wouldn't let me. He said I already knew enough to suit him."

I groaned. "I'll teach you. We can start tomorrow morning if you want."

"Okay." She gave me an odd smile and began ordering her bag and her few
possessions, bundled in my scavenged pillowcase. She lay down in her bag
and turned on her side to look at me. "I didn't think I'd like you," she
said. "Preacher's kid, all over the place, teaching, telling everybody
what to do, sticking your damn nose in everything. But you ain't bad."

I went from surprise into amusement of my own. "Neither are you," I
said.

"You didn't like me either?" Her turn to be surprised.

"You were the best looking woman in the neighborhood. No, I wasn't crazy
about you. And remember a couple of years ago when you tried your
hardest to make me throw up while I was learning to clean and skin
rabbits?"

"Why'd you want to learn that, anyway?" she asked. "Blood, guts, worms.
... I just figured, There she goes again, sticking her nose where it
don't belong. Well, let her have it!'"

"I wanted to know that I could do that---handle a dead animal, skin it,
butcher it, treat its hide to make leather. I wanted to know how to do
it, and that I could do it without getting sick."

"Why?"

"Because I thought someday I might have to. And we might out here. Same
reason I put together an emergency pack and kept it where I could grab
it."

"I wondered about that---about you having all that stuff from home, I
mean. At first I thought maybe you got it all when you went back. But
no, you were ready for all the trouble. You saw it coming."

"No." I shook my head, remembering. "No one could have been ready for
that. But ... I thought something would happen someday. I didn't know
how bad it would be or when it would come. But everything was getting
worse: the climate, the economy, crime, drugs, you know. I didn't
believe we would be allowed to sit behind our walls, looking clean and
fat and rich to the hungry, thirsty, homeless, jobless, filthy people
outside."

She turned again and lay on her back, staring upward at the stars. "I
should have seen some of that stuff," she said. "But I didn't. Those big
walls. And everybody had a gun. There were guards every night. I thought
... I thought we were so strong."

I put my notebook and pen down, sat on my sleepsack, and put my own
pillowcased bundle behind me. Mine was lumpy and uncomfortable to lean
on. I wanted it uncomfortable. I was tired. Everything ached. Given a
little comfort, I would fall asleep.

The sun was down now, and our fire had gone out except for a few glowing
coals. I drew the gun and held it in my lap. If I needed it at all, I
would need it fast. We weren't strong enough to survive slowness or
stupid mistakes.

I sat where I was for three weary, terrifying hours. Nothing happened to
me, but I could see and hear things happening. There were people moving
around the hills, sometimes silhouetting themselves against the sky as
they ran or walked over the tops of hills. I saw groups and individuals.
Twice I saw dogs, distant, but alarming. I heard a lot of
gunfire---individual shots and short bursts of automatic weapons fire.
That last and the dogs worried me, scared me. A pistol would be no
protection against a machine gun or automatic rifle. And dogs might not
know enough to be afraid of guns. Would a pack keep coming if I shot two
or three of its members? I sat in a cold sweat, longing for walls---or
at least for another magazine or two for the gun.

It was nearly midnight when I woke Harry, gave him the gun and the
watch, and made him as uncomfortable as I could by warning him about the
dogs, the gunfire, and the many people who wandered around at night. He
did look awake and alert enough when I lay down.

I fell asleep at once. Aching and exhausted, I found the hard ground as
welcoming as my bed at home.

A shout awoke me. Then I heard gunfire---several single shots,
thunderous and nearby. Harry?

Something fell across me before I could get out of my
sleep-sack---something big and heavy. It knocked the breath out of me. I
struggled to get it off me, knowing that it was a human body, dead or
unconscious. As I pushed at it and felt its heavy beard stubble and long
hair, I realized it was a man, and not Harry. Some stranger.

I heard scrambling and thrashing near me. There were grunts and sounds
of blows. A fight. I could see them in the darkness---two figures
struggling on the ground. The one on the bottom was Harry.

He was fighting someone over the gun, and he was losing. The muzzle was
being forced toward him.

That couldn't happen. We couldn't lose the gun or Harry. I took a small
granite boulder from our fire pit, set my teeth, and brought it down
with all my strength on the back of the intruder's head. And I brought
myself down.

It wasn't the worst pain I had ever shared, but it came close. I was
worthless after delivering that one blow. I think I was unconscious for
a while.

Then Zahra appeared from somewhere, feeling me, trying to see me. She
wouldn't find a wound, of course.

I sat up, fending her off, and saw that Harry was there, too.

"Are they dead?" I asked.

"Never mind them," he said. "Are you all right?"

I got up, swaying from the residual shock of the blow. I felt sick and
dizzy, and my head hurt. A few days before, Harry had made me feel that
way and we'd both recovered. Did that mean the man I'd hit would
recover?

I checked him. He was still alive, unconscious, not feeling any pain
now. What I was feeling was my own reaction to the blow I'd struck.

"The other one's dead," Harry said. "This one ... Well, you caved in the
back of his head. I don't know why he's still alive."

"Oh, no," I whispered. "Oh hell." And then to Harry, "Give me the gun."

"Why?" he asked.

My fingers had found the blood and broken skull, soft and pulpy at the
back of the stranger's head. Harry was right. He should have been dead.

"Give me the gun," I repeated, and held out a bloody hand for it.
"Unless you want to do this yourself."

"You can't shoot him. You can't just ..."

"I hope you'd find the courage to shoot me if I were like that, and out
here with no medical care to be had. We shoot him, or leave him here
alive. How long do you think it will take him to die?"

"Maybe he won't die."

I went to my pack, struggling to navigate without throwing up. I pulled
it away from the dead man, groped within it, and found my knife. It was
a good knife, sharp and strong. I flicked it open and cut the
unconscious man's throat with it.

Not until the flow of blood stopped did I feel safe. The man's heart had
pumped his life away into the ground. He could not regain consciousness
and involve me in his agony.

But, of course, I was far from safe. Perhaps the last two people from my
old life were about to leave me. I had shocked and horrified them. I
wouldn't blame them for leaving.

"Strip the bodies," I said. "Take what they have, then we'll put them
into the scrub oaks down the hill where we gathered wood."

I searched the man I had killed, found a small amount of money in his
pants pocket and a larger amount in his right sock. Matches, a packet of
almonds, a packet of dried meat, and a packet of small, round, purple
pills. I found no knife, no weapon of any kind. So this was not one of
the pair that sized us up earlier in the night. I hadn't thought so.
Neither of them had been long-haired. Both of these were.

I put the pills back in the pocket I had taken them from. Everything
else, I kept. The money would help sustain us. The food might or might
not be edible. I would decide that when I could see it clearly.

I looked to see what the others were doing, and was relieved to find
them stripping the other body. Harry turned it over, then kept watch as
Zahra went through the clothing, shoes, socks, and hair. She was even
more thorough than I had been. With no hint of squeamishness, she hauled
off the man's clothing and examined its greasy pockets, seams, and hems.
I got the feeling she had done this before.

"Money, food, and a knife," she whispered at last.

"The other one didn't have a knife," I said, crouching beside them.
"Harry, what---?"

"He had one," Harry whispered. "He pulled it when I yelled for them to
stop. It's probably on the ground somewhere. Let's put these two down in
the oaks."

"You and I can do it," I said. "Give Zahra the gun. She can guard us."

I was glad to see him hand her the gun without protest. He had not made
a move to hand it to me when I asked, but that had been different.

We took the bodies down to the scrub oaks and rolled them into cover.
Then we kicked dirt over all the blood that we could see and the urine
that one of the men had released.

That wasn't enough. By mutual consent, we moved camp. This meant nothing
more than gathering our bundles and sleepsacks and carrying them over
the next low ridge and out of sight of where we had been.

If you camped on a hill between any two of the many low, riblike ridges,
you could have, almost, the privacy of a big, open-topped, three-walled
room. You were vulnerable from hill or ridge tops, but if you camped on
the ridges, you would be noticed by far more people. We chose a spot
between two ridges, settled, and sat silent for some time. I felt
set-apart. I knew I had to speak, and I was afraid that nothing I could
say would help. They might leave me. In disgust, in distrust, in fear,
they might decide that they couldn't travel with me any longer. Best to
try to get ahead of them.

"I'm going to tell you about myself," I said. "I don't know whether it
will help you to understand me, but I have to tell you. You have a right
to know."

And in low whispers, I told them about my mother---my biological
mother---and about my sharing.

When I finished, there was another long silence. Then Zahra spoke, and I
was so startled by the sound of her soft voice that I jumped.

"So when you hit that guy," she said, "it was like you hitting
yourself."

"No," I said. "I don't get the damage. Just the pain."

"But, I mean it felt like you hit yourself?"

I nodded. "Close enough. When I was little, I used to bleed along with
people if I hurt them or even if I saw them hurt. I haven't done that
for a few years."

"But if they're unconscious or dead, you don't feel anything."

"That's right."

"So that's why you killed that guy?"

"I killed him because he was a threat to us. To me in a special way, but
to you, too. What could we have done about him? Abandon him to the
flies, the ants, and the dogs? You might have been willing to do that,
but would Harry? Could we stay with him? For how long? To what purpose?
Or would we dare to hunt up a cop and try to report seeing a guy hurt
without involving ourselves. Cops are not trusting people. I think they
would want to check us out, hang on to us for a while, maybe charge us
with attacking the guy and killing his friend." I turned to look at
Harry who had not said a word. "What would you have done?" I asked.

"I don't know," he said, his voice hard with disapproval. "I only know I
wouldn't have done what you did."

"I wouldn't have asked you to do it," I said. "I didn't ask you. But,
Harry, I would do it again. I might have to do it again. That's why I'm
telling you this." I glanced at Zahra. "I'm sorry I didn't tell you
before. I knew I should, but talking about it is ... hard. Very hard.
I've never told anyone before. Now ..." I took a deep breath. "Now
everything's up to you."

"What do you mean?" Harry demanded.

I looked at him, wishing I could see his expression well enough to know
whether this was a real question. I didn't think it was. I decided to
ignore him.

"So what do you think?" I asked, looking at Zahra.

Neither of them said anything for a minute. Then Zahra began to speak,
began to say such terrible things in that soft voice of hers. After a
moment, I wasn't sure she was talking to us.

"My mama took drugs, too," she said. "Shit, where I was born,
everybody's mama took drugs---and whored to pay for them. And had babies
all the time, and threw them away like trash when they died. Most of the
babies did die from the drugs or accidents or not having enough to eat
or being left alone so much ... or from being sick. They were always
getting sick. Some of them were born sick. They had sores all over or
big things on their eyes---tumors, you know---or no legs or fits or
can't breathe right. ... All kinds of things. And some of the ones who
lived were dumb as dirt. Can't think, can't learn, just sit around nine,
ten years old, peeing in their pants, rocking back and forth, and
dripping spit down their chins. There's a lot of them."

She took my hand and held it. "You ain't got nothing wrong with you,
Lauren---nothing worth worrying about. That Paracetco shit was baby
milk."

How was it that I had not gotten to know this woman back in the
neighborhood? I hugged her. She seemed surprised, then hugged back.

We both looked at Harry.

He sat still, near us, but far from us---from me. "What would you do,"
he asked, "if that guy only had a broken arm or leg?"

I groaned, thinking about pain. I already knew more than I wanted to
about how broken bones feel. "I think I'd let him go," I said, "and I'm
sure I would be sorry for it. It would be a long time before I stopped
looking over my shoulder."

"You wouldn't kill him to escape the pain?"

"I never killed anyone back in the neighborhood to escape pain."

"But a stranger ..."

"I've said what I would do."

"What if I broke my arm?"

"Then I might not be much good to you. I would be having trouble with my
arm, too, after all. But we'd have two good arms between us." I sighed.
"We grew up together, Harry. You know me. You know what kind of person I
am. I might fail you, but if I could help myself, I wouldn't betray
you."

"I thought I knew you."

I took his hands, looked at their big, pale, blunt fingers. They had a
lot of strength in them, I knew, but I had never seen him use it to
bully anyone. He was worth some trouble, Harry was.

"No one is who we think they are," I said. "That's what we get for not
being telepathic. But you've trusted me so far---and I've trusted you.
I've just put my life in your hands. What are you going to do?"

Was he going to abandon me now to my "infirmity"---instead of me maybe
abandoning him at some future time due to a theoretical broken arm. And
I thought: One oldest kid to another, Harry; would that be responsible
behavior?

He took his hands back. "Well, I did know you were a manipulative
bitch," he said.

Zahra smothered a laugh. I was surprised. I'd never heard him use the
word before. I heard it now as a sound of frustration. He wasn't going
to leave. He was a last bit of home that I didn't have to give up yet.
How did he feel about that? Was he angry with me for almost breaking up
the group? He had reason to be, I suppose.

"I don't understand how you could have been like this all the time," he
said. "How could you hide your sharing from everyone?"

"My father taught me to hide it," I told him. "He was right. In this
world, there isn't any room for housebound, frightened, squeamish
people, and that's what I might have become if everyone had known about
me---all the other kids, for instance. Little kids are vicious. Haven't
you noticed?"

"But your brothers must have known."

"My father put the fear of God into them about it. He could do that. As
far as I know, they never told anyone. Keith used to play 'funny' tricks
on me, though."

"So ... you faked everyone out. You must be a hell of an actor."

"I *had* to learn to pretend to be normal. My father kept trying to
convince me that I was normal. He was wrong about that, but I'm glad he
taught me the way he did."

"Maybe you are normal. I mean if the pain isn't real, then maybe---"

"Maybe this sharing thing is all in my head? Of course it is! And I
can't get it out. Believe me, I'd love to."

There was a long silence. Then he asked, "What do you write in your book
every night?" Interesting shift.

"My thoughts," I said. "The day's events. My feelings."

"Things you can't say?" he asked. "Things that are important to you?"

"Yes."

"Then let me read something. Let me know something about the you that
hides. I feel as though ... as though you're a lie. I don't know you.
Show me something of you that's real."

What a request! Or was it a demand? I would have given him money to read
and digest some of the Earthseed portions of my journal. But he had to
be eased into them. If he read the wrong thing, it would just increase
the distance between us.

"The risks you ask me to take, Harry. ... But, yes, I'll show you some
of what I've written. I want to. It'll be another first for me. All I
ask is that you read what I show you aloud so Zahra can hear it. As soon
as it's light, I'll show you."

When it was light, I showed him this:

***"All that you touch***

***You Change.***

***All that you Change***

***Changes you.***

***The only lasting truth***

***Is Change.***

***God***

***Is Change."***

Last year, I chose these lines to the first page of the first book of
*Earthseed: The Books of the Living.* These lines say everything.
Everything!

Imagine him asking me for it.

I must be careful.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

[TUESDAY, AUGUST]{.small} 3, 2027

(from notes expanded [AUGUST]{.small} 8)

T[HERE'S A BIG FIRE]{.small} in the hills to the east of us. We saw it
begin as a thin, dark column of smoke, rising into an otherwise clear
sky. Now it's massive---a hillside or two? Several buildings? Many
houses? Our neighborhood again?

We kept looking at it, then looking away. Other people dying, losing
their families, their homes. ... Even when we had walked past it, we
looked back.

Had the people with painted faces done this, too? Zahra was crying as
she walked along, cursing in a voice so soft that I could hear only a
few of the bitter words.

Earlier today we left the 118 freeway to look for and finally connect
with the 23. Now we're on the 23 with charred overgrown wilderness on
one side and neighborhoods on the other. We can't see the fire itself
now. We've passed it, come a long way from it, put hills between it and
us as we head southward toward the coast. But we can still see the
smoke. We didn't stop for the night until it was almost dark and we were
all tired and hungry.

We've camped away from the freeway on the wilderness side of it, out of
sight, but not out of hearing of the shuffling hordes of people on the
move. I think that's a sound we'll hear for the whole of our journey
whether we stop in Northern California or go through to Canada. So many
people hoping for so much up where it still rains every year, and an
uneducated person might still get a job that pays in money instead of
beans, water, potatoes, and maybe a floor to sleep on.

But it's the fire that holds our attention. Maybe it was started by
accident. Maybe not. But still, people are losing what they may not be
able to replace. Even if they survive, insurance isn't worth much these
days.

People on the highway, shadowy in the darkness, had begun to reverse the
flow, to drift northward to find a way to the fire. Best to be early for
the scavenging.

"Should we go?" Zahra asked, her mouth full of dried meat. We built no
fire tonight. Best for us to vanish into the darkness and avoid guests.
We had put a tangle of trees and bushes at our backs and hoped for the
best.

"You mean go back and rob those people?" Harry demanded.

"Scavenge," she said. "Take what people don't need no more. If you're
dead, you don't need much."

"We should stay here and rest," I said. "We're tired, and it will be a
long time before things are cool enough over there to allow scavenging.
It's a long way off, anyway."

Zahra sighed. "Yeah."

"We don't have to do things like that, anyway," Harry said.

Zahra shrugged. "Every little bit helps."

"You were crying about that fire a while ago."

"Uh-uh," Zahra drew her knees up against her body. "I wasn't crying
about that fire. I was crying about our fire and my Bibi and thinking
about how much I hate people who set fires like that. I wish they would
burn. I wish I could burn them. I wish I could just take them and throw
them in the fire ... like they did my Bibi." And she began to cry again,
and he held her, apologizing and, I think, shedding a few tears himself.

Grief hit like that. Something would remind us of the past, of home, of
a person, and then we would remember that it was all gone. The person
was dead or probably dead. Everything we'd known and treasured was gone.
Everything except the three of us. And how well were we doing?

"I think we should move," Harry said sometime later. He was still
sitting with Zahra, one arm around her, and she seemed to welcome the
contact.

"Why?" she asked.

"I want to be higher, closer to the level of the freeway or above it. I
want to be able to see the fire if it jumps the freeway and spreads
toward us. I want to see it before it gets too close. Fire moves fast."

I groaned. "You're right," I said, "but moving now that it's dark is
risky. We could lose this place and find nothing better."

"Wait here," he said, and got up and walked away into the darkness. I
had the gun, so I hoped he kept his knife handy---and I hoped he
wouldn't need it. He was still raw about what had happened the night
before. He had killed a man. That bothered him. I had killed a man in a
much more cold-blooded way, according to him, and it didn't bother me.
But my "cold-bloodedness" bothered him. He wasn't a sharer. He didn't
understand that to me pain was the evil. Death was an end to pain. No
Bible verses were going to change that as far as I was concerned. He
didn't understand sharing. Why should he? Most people knew little or
nothing about it.

On the other hand, my Earthseed verses had surprised him, and, I think,
pleased him a little. I wasn't sure whether he liked the writing or the
reasoning, but he liked having something to read and talk about.

"Poetry?" he said this morning as he looked through the pages I showed
him---pages of my Earthseed notebook, as it happened. "I never knew you
cared about poetry."

"A lot of it isn't very poetical," I said. "But it's what I believe, and
I've written it as well as I could." I showed him four verses in
all---gentle, brief verses that might take hold of him without his
realizing it and live in his memory without his intending that they
should. Bits of the Bible had done that to me, staying with me even
after I stopped believing.

I gave to Harry, and through him to Zahra, thoughts I wanted them to
keep. But I couldn't prevent Harry from keeping other things as well:
His new distrust of me, for instance, almost his new dislike. I was not
quite Lauren Olamina to him any longer. I had seen that in his
expression off and on all day. Odd. Joanne hadn't liked her glimpse of
the real me either. On the other hand, Zahra didn't seem to mind. But
then, she hadn't known me very well at home. What she learned now, she
could accept without feeling lied to. Harry did feel lied to, and
perhaps he wondered what lies I was still telling or living. Only time
could heal that---if he let it.

We moved when he came back. He had found us a new campsite, near the
freeway and yet private. One of the huge freeway signs had fallen or
been knocked down, and now lay on the ground, propped up by a pair of
dead sycamore trees. With the trees, it formed a massive lean-to. The
rock and ash leavings of a campfire showed us that the place had been
used before. Perhaps there had been people here tonight, but they had
gone away to see what they could scavenge from the fire. Now we're here,
happy to get a little privacy, a view of the hills back where the fire
is, and the security, for what it was worth, of at least one wall.

"Good deal!" Zahra said, unrolling her sleepsack and settling down on
top of it. "I'll take the first watch tonight, okay?"

It was okay with me. I gave her the gun and lay down, eager for sleep.
Again I was amazed to find so much comfort in sleeping on the ground in
my clothes. There's no narcotic like exhaustion.

Sometime in the night I woke up to soft, small sounds of voices and
breathing. Zahra and Harry were making love. I turned my head and saw
them at it, though they were too much involved with each other to notice
me.

And, of course, no one was on watch.

I got caught up in their lovemaking, and had all I could do to lie still
and keep quiet. I couldn't escape their sensation. I couldn't keep an
efficient watch. I could either writhe with them or hold myself rigid. I
held rigid until they finished---until Harry kissed Zahra, then got up
to put his pants on and began his watch.

And I lay awake afterward, angry and worried. How in hell could I talk
to either of them about this? It would be none of my business except for
the time they chose for doing it. But look when that was! We could all
have been killed.

Still sitting up, Harry began to snore.

I listened for a couple of minutes, then sat up, reached over Zahra, and
shook him.

He jumped awake, stared around, then turned toward me. I couldn't see
more than a moving silhouette.

"Give me the gun and go back to sleep," I said.

He just sat there.

"Harry, you'll get us killed. Give me the gun and the watch and lie
down. I'll wake you later."

He looked at the watch.

"Sorry," he said. "Guess I was more tired than I thought." His voice
grew less sleep-fogged. "I'm all right. I'm awake. Go back to sleep."

His pride had kicked in. It would be almost impossible to get the gun
and the watch from him now.

I lay down. "Remember last night," I said. "If you care about her at
all, if you want her to live, remember last night."

He didn't answer. I hoped I had surprised him. I supposed I had also
embarrassed him. And maybe I had made him feel angry and defensive.
Whatever I'd done, I didn't hear him doing any more snoring.

Wednesday, August 4, 2027

Today we stopped at a commercial water station and filled ourselves and
all our containers with clean, safe water. Commercial stations are best
for that. Anything you buy from a water peddler on the freeway ought to
be boiled, and still might not be safe. Boiling kills disease organisms,
but may do nothing to get rid of chemical residue---fuel, pesticide,
herbicide, whatever else has been in the bottles that peddlers use. The
fact that most peddlers can't read makes the situation worse. They
sometimes poison themselves.

Commercial stations let you draw whatever you pay for---and not a drop
more---right out of one of their taps. You drink whatever the local
householders are drinking. It might taste, smell, or look bad, but you
can depend on it not to kill you.

There aren't enough water stations. That's why water peddlers exist.
Also, water stations are dangerous places. People going in have money.
People coming out have water, which is as good as money. Beggars and
thieves hang around such places---keeping the whores and drug dealers
company. Dad warned us all about water stations, trying to prepare us in
case we ever went out and got caught far enough from home to be tempted
to stop for water. His advice: "Don't do it. Suffer. Get your rear end
home."

Yeah.

Three is the smallest comfortable number at a water station. Two to
watch and one to fill up. And it's good to have three ready for trouble
on the way to and from the station. Three would not stop determined
thugs, but it would stop opportunists---and most predators are
opportunists. They prey on old people, lone women or women with young
kids, handicapped people. ... They don't want to get hurt. My father
used to call them coyotes. When he was being polite, he called them
coyotes.

We were coming away with our water when we saw a pair of two-legged
coyotes grab a bottle of water from a woman who was carrying a sizable
pack and a baby. The man with her grabbed the coyote who had taken the
water, the coyote passed the water to his partner, and his partner ran
straight into us.

I tripped him. I think it was the baby who attracted my attention, my
sympathy. The tough plastic bubble that held the water didn't break. The
coyote didn't break either. I set my teeth, sharing the jolt as he fell
and the pain of his scraped forearms. Back home, the younger kids hit me
with that kind of thing every day.

I stepped back from the coyote and put my hand on the gun. Harry stepped
up beside me. I was glad to have him there. We looked more intimidating
together.

The husband of the woman had thrown off his attacker, and the two
coyotes, finding themselves outnumbered, scampered away. Skinny, scared
little bastards out to do their daily stealing.

I picked up the plastic bubble of water and handed it to the man.

He took it and said, "Thanks man. Thanks a lot."

I nodded and we went on our way. It still felt strange to be called
"man." I didn't like it, but that didn't matter.

"All of a sudden you're a Good Samaritan," Harry said. But he didn't
mind. There was no disapproval in his voice.

"It was the baby, wasn't it?" Zahra asked.

"Yes," I admitted. "The family, really. All of them together." All of
them together. They had been a black man, a Hispanic-looking woman, and
a baby who managed to look a little like both of them. In a few more
years, a lot of the families back in the neighborhood would have looked
like that. Hell, Harry and Zahra were working on starting a family like
that. And as Zahra had once observed, mixed couples catch hell out here.

Yet there were Harry and Zahra, walking so close together that they
couldn't help now and then brushing against each other. But they kept
alert, looked around. We were on U.S. 101 now, and there were even more
walkers. Even clumsy thieves would have no trouble losing themselves in
this crowd.

But Zahra and I had had a talk this morning during her reading lesson.
We were supposed to be working on the sounds of letters and the spelling
of simple words. But when Harry went off to the bushes of our designated
toilet area, I stopped the lesson.

"Remember what you said to me a couple of days ago?" I asked her. "My
mind was wandering and you warned me. 'People get killed on freeways all
the time,' you said."

To my surprise, she saw where I was headed at once. "Damn you," she
said, looking up from the paper I had given her. "You don't sleep sound
enough, that's all." She smiled as she said it.

"You want privacy, I'll give it to you," I said. "Just let me know, and
I'll guard the camp from someplace a short distance away. You two can do
what you want. But no more of this shit when you're on watch!"

She looked surprised. "Didn't think you said words like that."

"And I didn't think you did things like last night. Dumb!"

"I know. Fun, though. He's a big strong boy." She paused. "You jealous?"

"Zahra!"

"Don't worry," she said. "Things took me by surprise last night. I ... I
needed something, someone. It won't be like that no more."

"Okay."

"You jealous?" she repeated.

I made myself smile. "I'm as human as you are," I said. "But I don't
think I would have yielded to temptation out here with no prospects, no
idea what's going to happen. The thought of getting pregnant would have
stopped me cold."

"People have babies out here all the time." She grinned at me. "What
about you and that boyfriend of yours."

"We were careful. We used condoms."

Zahra shrugged. "Well Harry and me didn't. If it happens, it happens."

It had apparently happened to the couple whose water we had saved. Now
they had a baby to lug north.

They stayed near us today, that couple. I saw them every now and then.
Tall, stocky, velvet-skinned, deep-black man carrying a huge pack;
short, pretty, stocky, light-brown woman with baby and pack; medium
brown baby a few months old---huge-eyed baby with curly black hair.

They rested when we rested. They're camped now not far behind us. They
look more like potential allies than potential dangers, but I'll keep an
eye on them.

Thursday, August 5, 2027

Late today we came within sight of the ocean. None of us have ever seen
it before, and we had to go closer, look at it, camp within sight and
sound and smell of it. Once we had decided to do that, we walked
shoeless in the waves, pants legs rolled up. Sometimes we just stood and
stared at it: the Pacific Ocean---the largest, deepest body of water on
earth, almost half-a-world of water. Yet, as it was, we couldn't drink
any of it.

Harry stripped down to his underwear and waded out until the cool water
reached his chest. He can't swim, of course. None of us can swim. We've
never before seen water enough to swim in. Zahra and I watched Harry
with a lot of concern. Neither of us felt free to follow him. I'm
supposed to be a man and Zahra attracts enough of the wrong kind of
attention with all her clothes on. We decided to wait until after
sundown and go in fully clothed, just to wash away some of the grime and
stink. Then we could change clothes. We both had soap and we were eager
to make use of it.

There were other people on the beach. In fact, the narrow strip of sand
was crowded with people, though they managed to stay out of each other's
way. They had spread themselves out and seemed far more tolerant of one
another than they had during our night in the hills. I didn't hear any
shooting or fighting. There were no dogs, no obvious thefts, no rape.
Perhaps the sea and the cool breeze lulled them. Harry wasn't the only
one to strip down and go into the water. Quite a few women had gone out,
wearing almost nothing. Maybe this was a safer place than any we'd seen
so far.

Some people had tents, and several had built fires. We settled in
against the remnants of a small building. We were always, it seemed,
looking for walls to shield us. Was it better to have them and perhaps
get trapped against them or to camp in the open and be vulnerable on
every side? We didn't know. It just felt better to have at least one
wall.

I salvaged a flat piece of wood from the building, went a few yards
closer to the ocean, and began to dig into the sand. I dug until I found
dampness. Then I waited.

"What's supposed to happen?" Zahra asked. Until now she had watched me
without saying anything.

"Drinkable water," I told her. "According to a couple of books I read,
water is supposed to seep up through the sand with most of the salt
filtered out of it."

She looked into the damp hole. "When?" she asked.

I dug a little more. "Give it time," I said. "If the trick works, we
ought to know about it. It might save our lives someday."

"Or poison us or give us a disease," she said. She looked up to see
Harry coming toward us, dripping wet. Even his hair was wet.

"He don't look bad naked," she said.

He was still wearing his underwear, of course, but I could see what she
meant. He had a nice, strong-looking body, and I don't think he minded
our looking at it. And he looked clean and he didn't stink.

I couldn't wait to get into the water.

"Go ahead," he said. "It's sundown. I'll watch our stuff. Go."

We got our soap out, gave him the gun, took off shoes and socks, and
went. It was wonderful. The water was cold and it was hard to stand up
in the waves and the sand kept being drawn away from our feet, even
drawn from under our feet. But we threw water on each other and washed
everything---clothing, bodies, and hair---let the waves knock us around,
and laughed like crazy people. Best time I've had since we left home.

Quite a lot of water had seeped into the hole I dug by the time we got
back to Harry. I tasted it---took a little up in my hand while Harry
criticized me.

"Look at all the people in this damned place!" he said. "Do you see any
bathrooms? What do you think they do out here. You ought to at least
have the sense to use a water purification tablet!"

That thought was enough to make me spit out the mouthful of water that I
had taken. He was right, of course. But that one mouthful had told me
what I wanted to know. The water had been a little brackish, but not
bad---drinkable. It should be boiled or a water purification tablet
should be added to it, as Harry had said, and before that, according to
my book, it could be strained through sand to get rid of more of the
salt. That meant if we stayed near the coast, we could survive even if
we ran short of water. That was good to know.

We still had our shadows. The couple with the baby had camped near us,
and the woman was now sitting on the sand nursing her baby while the man
knelt beside his pack, rummaging through it.

"Do you think they want to wash?" I asked Harry and Zahra.

"What are you going to do?" Zahra responded. "Offer to babysit?"

I shook my head. "No, I think that would be too much. Do either of you
mind if I invite them over?"

"Aren't you afraid they'll rob us?" Harry demanded. "You're afraid of
everyone else."

"They have better gear than we do," I said. "And they have no natural
allies around here except us. Mixed couples or groups are rare out here.
No doubt that's why they've kept close to us."

"And you helped them," Zahra said. "People don't help strangers too much
out here. And you gave them back their water. That means you have enough
so you don't have to rob them."

"So do you mind?" I asked again.

They looked at each other.

"I don't mind," Zahra said. "Long as we keep an eye on them."

"Why do you want them?" Harry asked, watching me.

"They need us more than we need them," I said.

"That's not a reason."

"They're potential allies."

"We don't need allies."

"Not now. But we'd be damned fools to wait and try to get them when we
do need them. By then, they might not be around."

He shrugged and sighed. "All right. Like Zahra says, as long as we watch
them."

I got up and went over to the couple. I could see them straighten and go
tense as I approached. I was careful not to go too close or move too
fast.

"Hello," I said. "If you two would like to take turns bathing, you can
come over and join us. That might be safer for the baby."

"Join you?" the man said. "You're asking us to join you?"

"Inviting you."

"Why?"

"Why not. We're natural allies---the mixed couple and the mixed group."

"Allies?" the man said, and he laughed.

I looked at him, wondering why he laughed.

"What the hell do you really want?" he demanded.

I sighed. "Come join us if you want to. You're welcome, and in a pinch,
five is better than two." I turned and left them. Let them talk it over
and decide.

"They coming?" Zahra asked when I got back.

"I think so," I said. "Although maybe not tonight."

Friday, August 6, 2027

We built a fire and had a hot meal last night, but the mixed family did
not join us. I didn't blame them. People stay alive out here by being
suspicious. But they didn't go away either. And it was no accident that
they had chosen to stay near us. It was a good thing for them that they
were near us. The peaceful beach scene changed late last night. Dogs
came onto the sand.

They came during my watch. I saw movement far down the beach and I
focused on it. Then there was shouting, screams. I thought it was a
fight or a robbery. I didn't see the dogs until they broke away from a
group of humans and ran inland. One of them was carrying something, but
I couldn't tell what it was. I watched them until they vanished inland.
People chased them for a short distance, but the dogs were too fast.
Someone's property was lost---someone's food, no doubt.

I was on edge after that. I got up, moved to the inland end of our wall,
sat there where I could see more of the beach. I was there, sitting
still with the gun in my lap when I spotted movement perhaps a long city
block up the beach. Dark forms against pale sand. More dogs. Three of
them. They nosed around the sand for a moment, then headed our way. I
sat as still as I could, watching. So many people slept without posting
watches. The three dogs wandered among the camps, investigating what
they pleased, and no one tried to drive them away. On the other hand,
peoples oranges, potatoes, and grain meal couldn't be very tempting to a
dog. Our small supply of dried meat might be another matter. But no dog
would get it.

But the dogs stopped at the camp of the mixed couple. I remembered the
baby and jumped up. At the same moment, the baby began to cry. I shoved
Zahra with my foot and she came awake all at once. She could do that.

"Dogs," I said. "Wake Harry." Then I headed for the mixed couple. The
woman was screaming and beating at a dog with her hands. A second dog
was dodging the man's kicks and going for the baby. Only the third dog
was clear of the family.

I stopped, slipped the safety, and as the third dog went in toward the
baby, I shot it.

The dog dropped without a sound. I dropped, too, gasping, feeling kicked
in the chest. It surprised me how hard the loose sand was to fall on.

At the crack of the shot, the other two dogs took off inland. From my
prone position, I sighted on them as they ran. I might have been able to
pick off one more of them, but I let them go. I hurt enough already. I
couldn't catch my breath, it seemed. As I gasped, though, it occurred to
me that prone was a good shooting position for me. Sharing would be less
able to incapacitate me at once if I shot two-handed and prone. I filed
the knowledge away for future use. Also, it was interesting that the
dogs had been frightened by my shot. Was it the sound that scared them
or the fact that one of them had been hit? I wish I knew more about
them. I've read books about them being intelligent, loyal pets, but
that's all in the past. Dogs now are wild animals who will eat a baby if
they can.

I felt that the dog I had shot was dead. It wasn't moving. But by now a
lot of people were awake and moving around. A living dog, even wounded,
would be frantic to get away.

The pain in my chest began to ebb. When I could breathe without gasping,
I stood up and walked back to our camp. There was so much confusion by
then that no one noticed me except Harry and Zahra.

Harry came out to meet me. He took the gun from my hand, then took my
arm and steered me back to my sleepsack.

"So you hit something," he said as I sat gasping again from the small
exertion.

I nodded. "Killed a dog. I'll be okay soon."

"You need a keeper," he said.

"Dogs were after the baby!"

"You've adopted those damned people."

I smiled in spite of myself, liking him, thinking that I'd pretty much
adopted him and Zahra, too. "What's wrong with that?" I asked.

He sighed. "Get in your bag and go to sleep, will you. I'll take the
next watch."

"Some people just came and carried off the dog you killed," Zahra said.
"We should have got it."

"I'm not ready to eat a dog yet," Harry told her. "Go to sleep."

The names of the members of the mixed family are Travis Charles Douglas,
Gloria Natividad Douglas, and six-month-old Dominic Douglas, also called
Domingo. They gave in and joined us tonight after we made camp. We've
detoured away from the highway to make camp on another beach, and
they've followed. Once we were settled, they came over to us, uncertain
and suspicious, offering us small pieces of their treasure: milk
chocolate full of almonds. Real milk chocolate, not carob candy. It was
the best thing I'd tasted since long before leaving Robledo.

"It was you last night?" Natividad asked Harry. The first thing she had
told us was to call her Natividad.

"It was Lauren," Harry said, gesturing toward me.

She looked at me. "Thank you."

"Is your baby all right?" I asked.

"He had scratches and sand in his eyes and mouth from being dragged."
She stroked the sleeping baby's black hair. "I put salve on the
scratches and washed his eyes. He's all right now. He's so good. He only
cried a little bit."

"Hardly ever cries," Travis said with quiet pride. Travis has an unusual
deep-black complexion---skin so smooth that I can't believe he has ever
in his life had a pimple. Looking at him makes me want to touch him and
see how all that perfect skin feels. He's young, good looking, and
intense---a stocky, muscular man, tall, but a little shorter and a
little heavier than Harry. Natividad is stocky, too---a pale brown woman
with a round, pretty face, long black hair bound up in a coil atop her
head. She's short, but it isn't surprising somehow that she can carry a
pack and a baby and keep up a steady pace all day. I like her, feel
inclined to trust her. I'll have to be careful about that. But I don't
believe she would steal from us. Travis has not accepted us yet, but she
has. We've helped her baby. We're her friends.

"We're going to Seattle," she told us. "Travis has an aunt there. She
says we can stay with her until we find work. We want to find work that
pays money."

"Don't we all," Zahra agreed. She sat on Harry's sleepsack with him, his
arm around her. Tonight could be tiresome for me.

Travis and Natividad sat on their three sacks, spread out to give their
baby room to crawl when he woke up. Natividad had harnessed him to her
wrist with a length of clothesline.

I felt alone between the two couples. I let them talk about their hopes
and rumors of northern edens. I took out my notebook and began to write
up the day's events, still savoring the last of the chocolate.

The baby awoke hungry and crying. Natividad opened her loose shirt, gave
him a breast, and moved over near me to see what I was doing.

"You can read and write," she said with surprise. "I thought you might
be drawing. What are you writing?"

"She's always writing," Harry said. "Ask to read her poetry. Some of it
isn't bad."

I winced. My name is androgynous, in pronunciation at least---Lauren
sounds like the more masculine Loren. But pronouns are more specific,
and still a problem for Harry.

"She?" Travis asked right on cue. "Her?"

"Damn it, Harry," I said. "We forgot to buy that tape for your mouth."

He shook his head, then gave me an embarrassed smile. "I've known you
all my life. It isn't easy to remember to switch all your pronouns. I
think it's all right this time, though."

"I told you so!" Natividad said to her husband. Then she looked
embarrassed. "I told him you didn't look like a man," she said to me.
"You're tall and strong, but ... I don't know. You don't have a man's
face."

I had, almost, a man's chest and hips, so maybe I should be glad to hear
that I didn't have a man's face---though it wasn't going to help me on
the road. "We believed two men and a woman would be more likely to
survive than two women and a man," I said. "Out here, the trick is to
avoid confrontation by looking strong."

"The three of us aren't going to help you look strong," Travis said. He
sounded bitter. Did he resent the baby and Natividad?

"You are our natural allies," I said. "You sneered at that last time I
said it, but it's true. The baby won't weaken us much, I hope, and he'll
have a better chance of surviving with five adults around him."

"I can take care of my wife and my son," Travis said with more pride
than sense. I decided not to hear him.

"I think you and Natividad will strengthen us," I said. "Two more pairs
of eyes, two more pairs of hands. Do you have knives?"

"Yes." He patted his pants pocket. "I wish we had guns like you."

I wished we had guns---plural---too. But I didn't say so. "You and
Natividad look strong and healthy," I said. "Predators will look at a
group like the five of us and move on to easier prey."

Travis grunted, still noncommittal. Well, I had helped him twice, and
now I was a woman. It might take him a while to forgive me for that, no
matter how grateful he was.

"I want to hear some of your poetry," Natividad said. "The man we worked
for, his wife used to write poetry. She would read it to me sometimes
when she was feeling lonely. I liked it. Read me something of yours
before it gets too dark."

Odd to think of a rich woman reading to her maid---which was who
Natividad had been. Maybe I had the wrong idea of rich women. But then,
everyone gets lonely. I put my journal down and picked up my book of
Earthseed verses. I chose soft, non-preachy verses, good for road-weary
minds and bodies.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Sunday, August 8, 2027

"Y[OU BELIEVE IN ALL]{.small} this Earthseed stuff, don't you?" Travis
asked me.

It was our day off, our day of rest. We had left the highway to find a
beach where we could camp for the day and night and be comfortable. The
Santa Barbara beach we had found included a partly burned park where
there were trees and tables. It wasn't crowded, and we could have a
little daytime privacy. The water was only a short walk away. The two
couples took turns disappearing while I watched their packs and the
baby. Interesting that the Douglases were already comfortable trusting
me with all that was precious to them. We didn't trust them to watch
alone last night or the night before, though we did make them watch. We
had no walls to put our backs against last night so it was useful to
have two watchers at a time. Natividad watched with me and Travis
watched with Harry. Finally, Zahra watched alone.

I organized that, feeling that it was the schedule that would be most
comfortable to both couples. Neither would be required to trust the
other too much.

Now, amid the outdoor tables, firepits, pines, palms, and sycamores,
trust seems not to be a problem. If you turn your back to the burned
portion which is barren and ugly, this is a beautiful place, and it's
far enough from the highway not to be found by the ever-flowing river of
people moving north. I found it because I had maps---in particular, a
street map of much of Santa Barbara County. My grandparents' maps helped
us explore away from the highway even though many street signs were
fallen or gone. There were enough left for us to find beaches when we
were near them.

There were locals at this beach---people who had left real homes to
spend an August day at the beach. I eavesdropped on a few fragments of
conversation and found out that much.

Then I tried talking to some of them. To my surprise, most were willing
to talk. Yes, the park was beautiful except where some painted fools had
set fires. The rumors were that they did it to fight for the poor, to
expose or destroy the goods hoarded by the rich. But a park by the sea
wasn't goods. It was open to everyone. Why burn it? No one knew why.

No one knew where the fad of painting yourself and getting high on drugs
and fire had come from, either. Most people suspected it had begun in
Los Angeles where, according to them, most stupid or wicked things
began. Local prejudice. I didn't tell any of them I was from the LA.
area. I just smiled and asked about the local job situation. Some people
said they knew where I could work to earn a meal or a "safe" place to
sleep, but no one knew where I could earn money. That didn't mean there
weren't any such jobs, but if there were, they would be hard to find and
harder to qualify for. That's going to be a problem wherever we go. And
yet we know a lot, the three of us, the five of us. We know how to do a
great many things. There must be a way to put it all together and make
us something other than domestic servants working for room and board. We
make an interesting unit.

Water is very expensive here---worse than in Los Angeles or Ventura
Counties. We all went to a water station this morning. Still no freeway
watersellers for us.

On the road yesterday, we saw three dead men---a group together, young,
unmarked, but covered with the blood they had vomited, their bodies
bloated and beginning to stink. We passed them, looked at them, took
nothing from their bodies. Their packs---if they'd had any---were
already gone. Their clothes, we did not want. And their canteens---all
three still had canteens---their canteens, no one wanted.

We all resupplied yesterday at a local Hanning Joss. We were relieved
and surprised to see it---a good dependable place where we could buy all
we needed from solid food for the baby to soap to salves for skin chafed
by salt water, sun, and walking. Natividad bought new liners for her
baby carrier and washed and dried a plastic bag of filthy old ones.
Zahra went with her into the separate laundry area of the store to wash
and dry some of our filthy clothing. We wore our sea-washed clothing,
salty, but not quite stinking. Paying to wash clothes was a luxury we
could not often afford, yet none of us found it easy to be filthy. We
weren't used to it. We were all hoping for cheaper water in the north. I
even bought a second clip for the gun---plus solvent, oil, and brushes
to clean the gun. It had bothered me, not being able to clean it before.
If the gun failed us when we needed it, we could be killed. The new clip
was a comfort, too. It gave us a chance to reload fast and keep
shooting.

Now we lounged in the shade of pines and sycamores, enjoyed the sea
breeze, rested, and talked. I wrote, fleshing out my journal notes for
the week. I was just finishing that when Travis sat down next to me and
asked his question:

"You believe in all this Earthseed stuff, don't you?"

"Every word," I answered.

"But ... you made it up."

I reached down, picked up a small stone, and put it on the table between
us. "If I could analyze this and tell you all that it was made of, would
that mean I'd made up its contents?"

He didn't do more than glance at the rock. He kept his eyes on me. "So
what did you analyze to get Earthseed?"

"Other people," I said, "myself, everything I could read, hear, see, all
the history I could learn. My father is---was---a minister and a
teacher. My stepmother ran a neighborhood school. I had a chance to see
a lot."

"What did your father think of your idea of God?"

"He never knew."

"You never had the guts to tell him."

I shrugged. "He's the one person in the world I worked hard not to
hurt."

"Dead?"

"Yes."

"Yeah. My parents, too." He shook his head. "People don't live long
these days."

There was a period of silence. After a while, he said, "How did you get
your ideas about God?"

"I was looking for God," I said. "I wasn't looking for mythology or
mysticism or magic. I didn't know whether there was a god to find, but I
wanted to know. God would have to be a power that could not be defied by
anyone or anything."

"Change."

"Change, yes,"

"But it's not a god. It's not a person or an intelligence or even a
thing. It's just ... I don't know. An idea."

I smiled. Was that such a terrible criticism? "It's a truth," I said.
"Change is ongoing. Everything changes in some way---size, position,
composition, frequency, velocity, thinking, whatever. Every living
thing, every bit of matter, all the energy in the universe changes in
some way. I don't claim that everything changes in every way, but
everything changes in some way."

Harry, coming in dripping from the sea, heard this last. "Sort of like
saying God is the second law of thermodynamics," he said, grinning. He
and I had already had this conversation.

"That's an aspect of God," I said to Travis. "Do you know about the
second law?"

He nodded. "Entropy, the idea that the natural flow of heat is from
something hot to something cold---not the other way---so that the
universe itself is cooling down, running down, dissipating its energy."

I let my surprise show.

"My mother wrote for newspapers and magazines at first," he said. "She
taught me at home. Then my father died and she couldn't earn enough for
us to keep the house. And she couldn't find any other work that paid
money. She had to take a job as a live-in cook, but she went on teaching
me."

"She taught you about entropy?" Harry asked.

"She taught me to read and write," Travis said. "Then she taught me to
teach myself. The man she worked for had a library---a whole big room
full of books."

"He let you read them?" I asked.

"He didn't let me near them." Travis gave me a humorless smile. "I read
them anyway. My mother would sneak them to me."

Of course. Slaves did that two hundred years ago. They sneaked around
and educated themselves as best they could, sometimes suffering
whipping, sale, or mutilation for their efforts.

"Did he ever catch you or her at it?" I asked.

"No." Travis turned to look toward the sea. "We were careful. It was
important. She never borrowed more than one book at a time. I think his
wife knew, but she was a decent woman. She never said anything. She was
the one who talked him into letting me marry Natividad."

The son of the cook marrying one of the maids. That was like something
out of another era, too.

"Then my mother died and all Natividad and I had was each other, and
then the baby. I was staying on as gardener-handyman, but then the old
bastard we worked for decided he wanted Natividad. He would try to watch
when she fed the baby Couldn't let her alone. That's why we left. That's
why his wife helped us leave. She gave us money. She knew it wasn't
Natividad's fault. And I knew I didn't want to have to kill the guy. So
we left."

In slavery when that happened, there was nothing the slaves could do
about it---or nothing that wouldn't get them killed, sold, or beaten.

I looked at Natividad who sat a short distance away, on spread out
sleepsacks, playing with her baby and talking to Zahra. She had been
lucky. Did she know? How many other people were less lucky---unable to
escape the master's attentions or gain the mistress's sympathies. How
far did masters and mistresses go these days toward putting less than
submissive servants in their places?

"I still can't see change or entropy as God," Travis said, bringing the
conversation back to Earthseed.

"Then show me a more pervasive power than change," I said. "It isn't
just entropy. God is more complex than that. Human behavior alone should
teach you that much. And there's still more complexity when you're
dealing with several things at once---as you always are. There are all
kinds of changes in the universe."

He shook his head. "Maybe, but nobody's going to worship them."

"I hope not," I said. "Earthseed deals with ongoing reality, not with
supernatural authority figures. Worship is no good without action. With
action, it's only useful if it steadies you, focuses your efforts, eases
your mind."

He gave me an unhappy smile. "Praying makes people feel better even when
there's no action they can take," he said. "I used to think that was all
God was good for---to help people like my mother stand what they had to
stand."

"That isn't what God is for, but there are times when that's what prayer
is for. And there are times when that's what these verses are for. God
is Change, and in the end, God prevails. But there's hope in
understanding the nature of God---not punishing or jealous, but
infinitely malleable. There's comfort in realizing that everyone and
everything yields to God. There's power in knowing that God can be
focused, diverted, shaped by anyone at all. But there's no power in
having strength and brains, and yet waiting for God to fix things for
you or take revenge for you. You know that. You knew it when you took
your family and got the hell out of your boss's house. God will shape us
all every day of our lives. Best to understand that and return the
effort: Shape God."

"Amen!" Harry said, smiling.

I looked at him, wavered between annoyance and amusement, and let
amusement win. "Put something on before you burn, Harry."

"You sounded like you could use an 'amen,'" he said as he put on a loose
blue shirt. "Do you want to go on preaching or do you want to eat?"

We had beans cooked with bits of dried meat, tomatoes, peppers, and
onions. It was Sunday. There were public firepits in the park, and we
had plenty of time. We even had a little wheat-flour bread and the baby
had real baby food with his milk instead of mashed or mother-chewed bits
of whatever we were eating.

It's been a good day. Every now and then, Travis would ask me another
question or toss me another challenge to Earthseed, and I would try to
answer without preaching him a sermon---which was hard. I think I
managed it most of the time. Zahra and Natividad got into an argument
about whether I was talking about a male god or a female god. When I
pointed out that Change had no sex at all and wasn't a person, they were
confused, but not dismissive. Only Harry refused to take the discussion
seriously. He liked the idea of keeping a journal, though. Yesterday he
bought a small notebook, and now he's writing, too---and helping Zahra
with her reading and writing lessons.

I'd like to draw him into Earthseed. I'd like to draw them all in. They
could be the beginning of an Earthseed community. I would love to teach
Dominic Earthseed as he grows up. I would teach him and he would teach
me. The questions little children ask drive you insane because they
never stop. But they also make you think. For now, though, I had to deal
with Travis's questions.

I took a chance. I told Travis about the Destiny.

He had asked and asked me what the point of Earthseed is. Why personify
change by calling it God? Since change is just an idea, why not call it
that? Just say change is important.

"Because after a while, it won't be important!" I told him. "People
forget ideas. They're more likely to remember God---especially when
they're scared or desperate."

"Then they're supposed to do what?" he demanded. "Read a poem?"

"Or remember a truth or a comfort or a reminder to action," I said.
"People do that all the time. They reach back to the Bible, the Talmud,
the Koran, or some other religious book that helps them deal with the
frightening changes that happen in life."

"Change does scare most people."

"I know. God is frightening. Best to learn to cope."

"Your stuff isn't very comforting."

"It is after a while. I'm still growing into it myself. God isn't good
or evil, doesn't favor you or hate you, and yet God is better partnered
than fought."

"Your God doesn't care about you at all," Travis said.

"All the more reason to care about myself and others. All the more
reason to create Earthseed communities and shape God together. 'God is
Trickster, Teacher, Chaos, Clay.' We decide which aspect we
embrace---and how to deal with the others."

"Is that what you want to do? Set up Earthseed communities?"

"Yes."

"And then what?"

There it was. The opening. I swallowed and turned a little so that I
could see the burned over area. It was so damn ugly. Hard to think
anyone had done that on purpose.

"And then what?" Travis insisted. "A God like yours wouldn't have a
heaven for people to hope for, so what is there?"

"Heaven," I said, facing him again. "Oh, yes. Heaven."

He didn't say anything. He gave me one of his suspicious looks and
waited.

"The Destiny of Earthseed is to take root among the stars,'" I said.
"That's the ultimate Earthseed aim, and the ultimate human change short
of death. It's a destiny we'd better pursue if we hope to be anything
other than smooth-skinned dinosaurs---here today, gone tomorrow, our
bones mixed with the bones and ashes of our cities, and so what?"

"Space?" he said. "Mars?"

"Beyond Mars," I said. "Other star systems. Living worlds."

"You're crazy as hell," he said, but I like the soft, quiet way he said
it---with amazement rather than ridicule.

I grinned. "I know it won't be possible for a long time. Now is a time
for building foundations---Earthseed communities---focused on the
Destiny. After all, my heaven really exists, and you don't have to die
to reach it. 'The Destiny of Earthseed is to take root among the stars,'
or among the ashes." I nodded toward the burned area.

Travis listened. He didn't point out that a person walking north from
LA. to who-knows-where with all her possessions on her back was hardly
in a position to point the way to Alpha Centauri. He listened. He
laughed a little---as though he were afraid to get caught being too
serious about my ideas. But he didn't back away from me. He leaned
forward. He argued. He shouted. He asked more questions. Natividad told
him to stop bothering me, but he kept it up. I didn't mind. I understand
persistence. I admire it.

Sunday, August 15, 2027

I think Travis Charles Douglas is my first convert. Zahra Moss is my
second. Zahra has listened as the days passed, and as Travis and I went
on arguing off and on. Sometimes she asked questions or pointed out what
she saw as inconsistencies. After a while, she said. "I don't care about
no outer space. You can keep that part of it. But if you want to put
together some kind of community where people look out for each other and
don't have to take being pushed around, I'm with you. I've been talking
to Natividad. I don't want to live the way she had to. I don't want to
live the way my mama had to either."

I wondered how much difference there was between Natividad's former
employer who treated her as though he owned her and Richard Moss who
purchased young girls to be part of his harem. It was all a matter of
personal feeling, no doubt. Natividad had resented her employer. Zahra
had accepted and perhaps loved Richard Moss.

Earthseed is being born right here on Highway 101---on that portion of
101 that was once El Camino Real, the royal highway of California's
Spanish past. Now it's a highway, a river of the poor. A river flooding
north.

I've come to think that I should be fishing that river even as I follow
its current. I should watch people not only to spot those who might be
dangerous to us, but to find those few like Travis and Natividad who
would join us and be welcome.

And then what? Find a place to squat and take over? Act as a kind of
gang? No. Not quite a gang. We aren't gang types. I don't want gang
types with their need to dominate, rob and terrorize. And yet we might
have to dominate. We might have to rob to survive, and even terrorize to
scare off or kill enemies. We'll have to be very careful how we allow
our needs to shape us. But we must have arable land, a dependable water
supply, and enough freedom from attack to let us establish ourselves and
grow.

It might be possible to find such an isolated place along the coast, and
make a deal with the inhabitants. If there were a few more of us, and if
we were better armed, we might provide security in exchange for living
room. We might also provide education plus reading and writing services
to adult illiterates. There might be a market for that kind of thing. So
many people, children and adults, are illiterate these days. ... We
might be able to do it---grow our own food, grow ourselves and our
neighbors into something brand new. Into Earthseed.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Friday, August 27, 2027

(from notes expanded [SUNDAY, AUGUST]{.small} 29)

E[ARTHQUAKE TODAY.]{.small}

It hit early this morning just as we were beginning the day's walk, and
it was a strong one. The ground itself gave a low, grating rumble like
buried thunder. It jerked and shuddered, then seemed to drop. I'm sure
it did drop, though I don't know how far. Once the shaking stopped,
everything looked the same---except for sudden patches of dust thrown up
here and there in the brown hills around us.

Several people screamed or shouted during the quake. Some, burdened by
heavy packs, lost their footing and fell into the dirt or onto the
broken asphalt. Travis, with Dominic on his chest and a heavy pack on
his back was almost one of these. He stumbled, staggered, and managed
somehow to catch himself. The baby, unhurt, but jolted by the sudden
shaking, began to cry, adding to the noise of two older children walking
nearby, the sudden talking of almost everyone, and the gasps of an old
man who had fallen during the quake.

I put aside my usual suspicions and went to see whether the old man was
all right---not that I could have done much to help him if he hadn't
been. I retrieved his cane for him---it had landed beyond his
reach---and helped him up. He was as light as a child, thin, toothless,
and frightened of me.

I gave him a pat on the shoulder and sent him on his way, checking when
his back was turned to see that he hadn't lifted anything. The world was
full of thieves. Old people and young kids were often pickpockets.

Nothing missing.

Another man nearby smiled at me---an older, but not yet old black man
who still had his teeth, and who pushed his belongings in twin
saddlebags hanging from a small, sturdy metal-framed cart. He didn't say
anything, but I liked his smile. I smiled back. Then I remembered that I
was supposed to be a man, and wondered whether he had seen through my
disguise. Not that it mattered.

I went back to my group where Zahra and Natividad were comforting
Dominic and Harry was picking up something from the roadside. I went to
Harry, and saw that he had found a filthy rag knotted into a small,
tight ball around something. Harry tore the rotten cloth and a roll of
money fell out into his hands. Hundred-dollar bills. Two or three dozen
of them.

"Put it away!" I whispered.

He pushed the money into a deep pants pocket. "New shoes," he whispered.
"Good ones, and other things. Do you need anything?"

I had promised to buy him a new pair of shoes as soon as we reached a
dependable store. His were worn out. Now another idea occurred to me.
"If you have enough," I whispered, "buy yourself a gun. I'll still get
your shoes. You get a gun!" Then I spoke to the others, ignoring his
surprise. "Is everyone all right?"

Everyone was. Dominic was happy again, riding now on his mother's back,
and playing with her hair. Zahra was readjusting her pack, and Travis
had gone on and was taking a look at the small community ahead. This was
farm country. We'd passed through nothing for days except small, dying
towns, withering roadside communities and farms, some working, some
abandoned and growing weeds.

We walked forward toward Travis.

"Fire," he said as we approached.

One house down the hill from the road smoked from several of its
windows. Already people from the highway had begun to drift down toward
it. Trouble. The people who owned the house might manage to put out
their fire and still be overwhelmed by scavengers.

"Let's get away from here," I said. "The people down there are still
strong, and they're going to feel besieged soon. They'll fight back."

"We might find something we can use," Zahra argued.

"There's nothing down there worth our getting shot over," I said. "Let's
go!" I led the way past the small community and we were almost clear of
it when the gunfire began.

There were people still on the road with us, but many had flooded down
into the small community to steal. The crowd would not confine its
attention to the one burning house, and all the households would have to
resist.

There were more shots behind us---first single shots, then an uneven
crackling of exchanged fire, then the unmistakable chatter of automatic
weapons fire. We walked faster, hoping that we were beyond the range of
anything aimed in our direction.

"Shit!" Zahra whispered, keeping up with me. "I should have known that
was going to happen. People out here in the middle of nowhere gotta be
tough."

"I don't think their toughness will get them through this day, though,"
I said, looking back. There was much more smoke rising now, and it was
rising from more than one place. Distant shouts and screams mixed with
the gunfire. Stupid place to put a naked little community. They should
have hidden their homes away in the mountains where few strangers would
ever see them. That was something for me to keep in mind. All the people
of this community could do now was take a few of their tormentors with
them. Tomorrow the survivors of this place would be on the road with
scraps of their belongings on their backs.

It's odd, but I don't think anyone on the road would have thought of
attacking that community en masse like that if the earthquake---or
something---had not started a fire. One small fire was the weakness that
gave scavengers permission to devastate the community---which they were
no doubt doing now. The shooting could scare away some, kill or wound
others, and make the remainder very angry. If the people of the
community chose to live in such a dangerous place, they should have set
up overwhelming defenses---a line of explosive charges and incendiaries,
that kind of thing. Only power that strong, that destructive, that
sudden would scare attackers off, would drive them away in a panic more
overwhelming than the greed and the need that had drawn them in the
first place. If the people of the community were without explosives,
they should have grabbed their money and their kids and run like crazy
the moment they saw the horde coming. They knew the hills better than
migrating scavengers could. They should have had hiding places already
prepared or at least been able to lose themselves among the hills while
scavengers were ransacking their homes. But they had done none of this.
And now vast thick clouds of smoke rose behind us, drawing even more
scavengers.

"Whole world's gone crazy," a voice near me said, and I knew before I
looked that it was the man with the saddlebagged cart. We'd slowed down
a little, looking back, and he had caught up. He too had had the sense
not to try to go scavenging in the little community. He didn't look like
a man who scavenged. His clothes were dirty and ordinary, but they fit
him well and they looked almost new. His jeans were still dark blue, and
still creased down the legs. His red, short-sleeved shirt still had all
its buttons. He wore expensive walking shoes and had had, not too long
ago, an expensive professional haircut. What was he doing out here on
the road, pushing a cart? A rich pauper---or at least, a once-rich
pauper. He had a short, full, salt and pepper beard. I decided that I
liked his looks as much as I had before. What a handsome old man.

Had the world gone crazy?

"From what I've read," I said to him, "the world goes crazy every three
or four decades. The trick is to survive until it goes sane again." I
was showing off my education and background; I admit it. But the old man
seemed unimpressed.

"The nineteen nineties were crazy," he said, "but they were rich.
Nothing like this bad. I don't think it's ever been this bad. Those
people, those animals back there ..."

"I don't see how they can act that way," Natividad said. "I wish we
could call the police---whoever the police are around here. The
householders back there should call."

"It wouldn't do any good," I said. "Even if the cops came today instead
of tomorrow, they'd just add to the death toll."

We walked on, the stranger walking with us. He seemed content to walk
with us. He could have dropped back or walked on ahead since he didn't
have to carry his load. As long as he stayed on the road, he could speed
along. But he stuck with us. I talked to him, introduced myself and
learned that his name was Bankole---Taylor Franklin Bankole. Our last
names were an instant bond between us. We're both descended from men who
assumed African surnames back during the 1960s. His father and my
grandfather had had their names legally changed, and both had chosen
Yoruba replacement names.

"Most people chose Swahili names in the '60s," Bankole told me. He
wanted to be called Bankole. "My father had to do something different.
All his life he had to be different."

"I don't know my grandfather's reasons," I said. "His last name was
Broome before he changed it, and that was no loss. But why he chose
Olamina ... ? Even my father didn't know. He made the change before my
father was born, so my father was always Olamina, and so were we."

Bankole was one year older than my father. He had been born in 1970, and
he was, according to him, too damn old to be tramping along a highway
with everything he owned in a couple of saddlebags. He was 57. I caught
myself wishing he were younger so he would live longer.

Old or not, he heard the two girls calling for help sooner than we did.

There was a road, more dirt than asphalt, running below and alongside
the highway, then veering away from the highway into the hills. Up that
road was a half-collapsed house, the dust of its collapse still hanging
over it. It couldn't have been much of a house before it fell in. Now it
was rubble. And once Bankole alerted us, we could hear faint shouts from
it.

"Sounds like women," Harry said.

I sighed. "Let's go see. It might just be a matter of pushing some wood
off them or something."

Harry caught me by the shoulder. "You sure?"

"Yeah." I took the gun out and gave it to him in case someone else's
pain made me useless. "Watch our backs," I said.

We went in wary and tentative, knowing that a call for help could be
false, could lure people to their attackers. A few other people followed
us off the road, and Harry hung back, staying between them and us.
Bankole shoved his cart along, keeping up with me.

There were two voices calling from the rubble. Both sounded like women.
One was pleading, the other cursing. We located them by the sound of
their voices, then Zahra, Travis and I began throwing off rubble---dry,
broken wood, plaster, plastic, and brick from an ancient chimney.
Bankole stood with Harry, watching, and looking formidable. Did he have
a gun? I hoped he did. We were drawing a small audience of hungry-eyed
scavengers. Most people looked to see what we were doing, and went on. A
few stayed and stared. If the women had been trapped since the
earthquake, it was surprising that no one had come already to steal
their belongings and set fire to the rubble, leaving them in it. I hoped
we would be able to get the women out and get back on the highway before
someone decided to rush us. No doubt they already would have if there
had been anything of value in sight.

Natividad spoke to Bankole, then put Dominic in one of his saddlebags
and felt to see that her knife was still in her pocket. I didn't like
that much. Better she should keep wearing the baby so we could leave at
a run if she had to.

We found a pale leg, bruised and bleeding but unbroken, pinned under a
beam. A whole section of wall and ceiling plus some of the chimney had
fallen on these women. We moved the loose stuff then worked together to
lift heavier pieces. At last we dragged the women out by their exposed
limbs---an arm and a leg for one, both legs for the other. I didn't
enjoy it any more than they did.

On the other hand, it wasn't that bad. The women had lost some skin here
and there, and one was bleeding from the nose and mouth. She spat out
blood and a couple of teeth and cursed and tried to get up. I let Zahra
help her up. All I wanted to do now was get away from here.

The other one, face wet with tears, just sat and stared at us. She was
quiet now in a blank, unnatural way. Too quiet. When Travis tried to
help her up, she cringed and cried out. Travis let her alone. She didn't
seem to be hurt beyond a few scratches, but she might have hit her head.
She might be in shock.

"Where's your stuff?" Zahra was asking the bloody one. "We're going to
have to get away from here fast."

I rubbed my mouth, trying to get past an irrational certainty that two
of my own teeth were gone. I felt horrible---scraped and bruised and
throbbing, yet whole and unbroken, undamaged in any major way I just
wanted to huddle somewhere until I felt less miserable. I took a deep
breath and went to the frightened, cringing woman.

"Can you understand me?" I asked.

She looked at me, then looked around, saw her companion wiping away
blood with a grimy hand, and tried to get up and run to her. She
tripped, started to fall, and I caught her, grateful that she wasn't
every big.

"Your legs are all right," I said, "but take it easy. We have to get out
of here soon, and you've got to be able to walk."

"Who are you?" she asked.

"A total stranger," I said. "Try to walk."

"There was an earthquake."

"Yeah. Walk!"

She took a shaky step away from me, then another. She staggered over to
her friend. "Allie?" she said.

Her friend saw her, stumbled to her, hugged her, smeared her with blood.
"Jill! Thank God!"

"Here's their stuff," Travis said. "Let's get them out of here while we
still can."

We made them walk a little more, tried to make them see and understand
the danger of staying where we were. We couldn't drag them with us, and
what would have been the point of digging them out, then leaving them at
the mercy of scavengers. They had to walk along with us until they were
stronger and able to take care of themselves.

"Okay" the bloody one said. She was the smaller and tougher of the two,
not that there was that much physical difference between them. Two
medium-size, brown-haired white women in their twenties. They might be
sisters.

"Okay," the bloody one repeated. "Let's get out of here." She was
walking without limping or staggering now, though her companion was less
steady.

"Give me my stuff," she said.

Travis waved her toward two dusty sleepsack packs. She put one on her
back, then looked at the other and at her companion.

"I can carry it," the other woman said. "I'm all right."

She wasn't, but she had to carry her own things. No one could carry a
double pack for long. No one could fight while carrying a double pack.

There were a dozen people standing around staring as we brought the two
women out. Harry walked ahead of us, gun in hand. Something about him
said with great clarity that he would kill. If he were pushed even a
little, he would kill. I hadn't seen him that way before. It was
impressive and frightening and wrong. Right for the situation and the
moment, but wrong for Harry. He wasn't the kind of man who ought ever to
look that way.

When had I begun thinking of him as a man rather than a boy? What the
hell. We're all men and women now, not kids anymore. Shit.

Bankole walked behind, looking even more formidable than Harry in spite
of his graying hair and beard. He had a gun in his hand. I had gotten a
look at it as I walked past him. Another automatic---perhaps a nine
millimeter. I hoped he was good with it.

Natividad pushed his cart along just ahead of him with Dominic still in
one of the bags. Travis walked beside her, guarding her and the baby.

I walked with the two women, fearful that one of them might fall or that
some fool might grab one. The one called Allie was still bleeding,
spitting blood and wiping her bloody nose with a bloody arm. And the one
called Jill still looked dull and shaky. Allie and I kept Jill between
us.

Before the attack began, I knew it would happen. Helping the two trapped
women had made us targets. We might already have been attacked if the
community down the road had not drawn off so many of the most violent,
desperate people. The weak would be attacked today. The quake had set
the mood. And one attack could trigger others.

We could only try to be ready.

Out of the blue, a man grabbed Zahra. She's small, and must have looked
weak as well as beautiful.

An instant later, someone grabbed me. I was spun around, and I tripped
and started to fall. It was that stupid. Before anyone could hit me, I
tripped and fell. But because my attacker had pulled me toward him, I
fell against him. I dragged him down with me. Somehow, I managed to get
my knife out. I flicked it open. I jabbed it upward into my attacker's
body.

The six inch blade went in to the hilt. Then, in empathic agony, I
jerked it out again.

I can't describe the pain.

The others told me later that I screamed as they'd never heard anyone
scream. I'm not surprised. Nothing has ever hurt me that much before.

After a while, the agony in my chest ebbed and died. That is, the man on
top of me bled and died. Not until then could I begin to be aware of
something other than pain.

The first thing I heard was Dominic, crying.

I understood then that I had also heard shots fired---several shots.
Where was everyone? Were they wounded?

Dead? Being held prisoner?

I kept my body still beneath the dead man. He was painfully heavy as
deadweight, and his body odor was nauseating. He had bled all over my
chest, and, if my nose was any judge, in death, he had urinated on me.
Yet I didn't dare move until I understood the situation.

I opened my eyes just a little.

Before I could understand what I was seeing, someone hauled the stinking
dead man off me. I found myself looking into two worried faces: Harry
and Bankole.

I coughed and tried to get up, but Bankole held me down.

"Are you hurt anywhere?" he demanded.

"No, I'm all right," I said. I saw Harry staring at all the blood, and I
added, "Don't worry. The other guy did all the bleeding."

They helped me up, and I discovered I was right. The dead man had
urinated on me. I was almost frantic with the need to strip off my
filthy clothes and wash. But that had to wait. No matter how disgusting
I was, I wouldn't undress in daylight where I could be seen. I'd had
enough trouble for one day.

I looked around, saw Travis and Natividad comforting Dominic who was
still screaming. Zahra was with the two new girls, standing guard beside
them as they sat on the ground.

"Are those two okay?" I asked.

Harry nodded. "They're scared and shaken up, but they're all right.
Everyone's all right---except him and his friends." He gestured toward
the dead man. There were three more dead lying nearby.

"There were some wounded," Harry said. "We let them go."

I nodded. "We'd better strip these bodies and go, too. We're too obvious
here from the highway."

We did a quick, thorough job, searching everything except body cavities.
We weren't needy enough to do that yet. Then, at Zahra's insistence, I
did go behind the ruined house for a quick change of clothing. She took
the gun from Harry and stood watch for me.

"You're bloody," she said. "If people think you're wounded, they might
jump you. This ain't a good day to look like you got something wrong
with you."

I suspected that she was right. Anyway, it was a pleasure to have her
talk me into something I already wanted so much to do.

I put my filthy, wet clothes into a plastic bag, sealed it, and stuffed
it into my pack. If any of the dead had owned clothing that would fit
me, and that was still in wearable condition, I would have thrown mine
away. As it was, I would keep them and wash them the next time we came
to a water station or a store that permitted washing. We had collected
money from the corpses, but it would be best to use that for
necessities.

We had taken about twenty-five hundred dollars in all from the four
corpses---along with two knives that we could sell or pass on to the two
girls, and one gun pulled by a man Harry had shot. The gun turned out to
be an empty, dirty Beretta nine millimeter. Its owner had had no
ammunition, but we can buy that---maybe from Bankole. For that we will
spend money. I had found a few pieces of jewelry in the pocket of the
man who attacked me---two gold rings, a necklace of polished blue stones
that I thought were lapis lazuli, and a single earring which turned out
to be a radio. The radio we would keep. It could give us information
about the world beyond the highway. It would be good not to be cut off
any longer. I wondered who my attacker had robbed to get it.

All four of the corpses had little plastic pill boxes hidden somewhere
on them. Two boxes contained a couple of pills each. The other two were
empty. So these people who carried neither food nor water nor adequate
weapons did carry pills when they could steal them or steal enough to
buy them. Junkies. What was their drug of choice, I wondered. Pyro? For
the first time in days, I found myself thinking of my brother Keith. Had
he dealt in the round purple pills we kept finding on people who
attacked us? Was that why he died?

A few miles later along the highway, we saw some cops in cars, heading
south toward what must now be a burned out hulk of a community with a
lot of corpses. Perhaps the cops would arrest a few late-arriving
scavengers. Perhaps they would scavenge a little themselves. Or perhaps
they would just have a look and drive away. What had cops done for my
community when it was burning? Nothing.

The two women we'd dug out of the rubble want to stay with us. Allison
and Jillian Gilchrist are their names. They are sisters, 24 and 25 years
old, poor, running away from a life of prostitution. Their pimp was
their father. The house that had fallen on them was empty when they took
shelter in it the night before. It looked long abandoned.

"Abandoned buildings are traps," Zahra told them as we walked. "Out here
in the middle of nowhere, they're targets for all kinds of people."

"Nobody bothered us," Jill said. "But then the house fell on us, and
nobody helped us either, until you guys came along."

"You're very fortunate," Bankole told her. He was still with us, and
walking next to me. "People don't help each other much out here."

"We know," Jill admitted. "We're grateful. Who are you guys, anyway?"

Harry gave her an odd little smile. "Earthseed," he said, and glanced at
me. You have to watch out for Harry when he smiles that way.

"What's Earthseed?" Jill asked, right on cue. She had let Harry direct
her gaze to me.

"We share some ideas," I said. "We intend to settle up north, and found
a community."

"Where up north?" Allie demanded. Her mouth was still hurting, and I
felt it more when I paid attention to her. At least her bleeding had
almost stopped.

"We're looking for jobs that pay salaries and we're watching water
prices," I said. "We want to settle where water isn't such a big
problem."

"Water's a problem everywhere," she proclaimed. Then, "What are you?
Some kind of cult or something?"

"We believe in some of the same things," I said.

She turned to stare at me with what looked like hostility. "I think
religion is dog shit," she announced. "It's either phony or crazy."

I shrugged. "You can travel with us or you can walk away."

"But what the hell do you stand for?" she demanded. "What do you pray
to?"

"Ourselves," I said. "What else is there?"

She turned away in disgust, then turned back. "Do we have to join your
cult if we travel with you?"

"No."

"All right then!" She turned her back and walked ahead of me as though
she'd won something.

I raised my voice just enough to startle and projected it at the back of
her head. I said, "We risked ourselves for you today."

She jumped, but refused to look back.

I continued. "You don't owe us anything for that. It isn't something you
could buy from us. But if you travel with us, and there's trouble, you
stand by us, stand with us. Now will you do that or not?"

Allie swung around, stiff with anger. She stopped right in front of me
and stood there.

I didn't stop or turn. It wasn't a time for giving way. I needed to know
what her pride and anger might drive her to. How much of that apparent
hostility of hers was real, and how much might be due to her pain? Was
she going to be more trouble than she was worth?

When she realized that I meant to walk over her if I had to, that I
would do it, she slid around me to walk beside me as though she had
intended to do that all along.

"If you hadn't been the ones to dig us out," she said, "we wouldn't
bother with you at all." She drew a deep, ragged breath. "We know how to
pull our own weight. We can help our friends and fight our enemies.
We've been doing that since we were kids."

I looked at her, thinking of the little that she and her sister had told
us about their lives: prostitution, pimp father. ... Hell of a story if
it were true. No doubt the details would be even more interesting. How
had they gotten away from their father, anyway? They would bear
watching, but they might turn out to be worth something.

"Welcome," I said.

She stared at me, nodded, then walked ahead of me in long quick strides.
Her sister, who had dropped to walk near us while we were talking, now
walked faster to join her. And Zahra, who had dropped back to keep an
eye on the sister, grinned at me and shook her head. She went up to join
Harry who was leading the group.

Bankole came up beside me again, and I realized he had gotten out of the
way as soon as he saw trouble between Allie and me.

"One fight a day is enough for me," he said when he saw me looking at
him.

I smiled. "Thank you for standing by us back there."

He shrugged. "I was surprised to see that anyone else cared what
happened to a couple of strangers."

"You cared."

"Yes. That kind of thing will get me killed someday. If you don't mind,
I'd like to travel with your group, too."

"You have been. You're welcome."

"Thank you," he said, and smiled back at me. He had clear eyes with deep
brown irises---attractive eyes. I like him too much already. I'll have
to be careful.

Late today we reached Salinas, a small city that seemed little touched
by the quake and its aftershocks. The ground has been shuddering off and
on all day. Also, Salinas seemed untouched by the hordes of overeager
scavengers that we had been seeing since that first burning community
this morning. That was a surprise. Almost all of the smaller communities
we'd passed had been burning and swarming with scavengers. It was as
though the quake had given yesterday's quiet, plodding paupers
permission to go animal and prey on anyone who still lives in a house.

I suspected that the bulk of the predatory scavengers were still behind
us, still killing and dying and fighting over the spoils. I've never
worked as hard at not seeing what was going on around me as I did today.
The smoke and the noise helped veil things from me. I had enough to do
dealing with Allie's throbbing face and mouth and the ambient misery of
the highway.

We were tired when we reached Salinas, but we had decided to walk on
after resupplying and washing. We didn't want to be in town when the
worst of the scavengers arrived. They might be calm, tired after their
day of burning and stealing, but I doubted it. I thought they would be
drunk with power and hungry for more. As Bankole said, "Once people get
the idea that it's all right to take what you want and destroy the rest,
who knows when they'll stop."

But Salinas looked well-armed. Cops had parked all along the shoulders
of the highway, staring at us, some holding their shotguns or automatic
rifles as though they'd love an excuse to use them. Maybe they knew what
was coming.

We needed to resupply, but we didn't know whether we would be allowed
to. Salinas had the look of a "stay on the road" type town---the kind
that wanted you gone by sundown unless you lived there. This week and
last, we had run across a few little towns like that.

But no one stopped us when we headed off the road to a store. There were
only a few people on the road now, and the cops were able to watch all
of us. I saw them watching us in particular, but they didn't stop us. We
were quiet. We were women and a baby as well as men, and three of us
were white. I don't think any of that harmed us in their eyes.

The security guards in the stores were as well-armed as the
cops---shot-guns and automatic rifles, a couple of machine guns on
tripods in cubicles above us. Bankole said he could remember a time when
security guards had revolvers or nothing but clubs. My father used to
talk like that.

Some of the guards either weren't very well trained---or they were
almost as power-drunk as the scavengers. They pointed their guns at us.
It was crazy. Two or three of us walked into a store and two or three
guns were trained on us. We didn't know what was going on at first. We
froze, staring, waiting to see what was going to happen.

The guys behind the guns laughed. One of them said, "Buy something or
get the fuck out!"

We got out. These were little stores. There were plenty of them to
choose from. Some of them turned out to have sane guards. I couldn't
help wondering how many accidents the crazy guards have with those guns.
I suppose that after the fact, every accident was an armed robber with
obvious homicidal inclinations.

The guards at the water station seemed calm and professional. They kept
their guns down and confined themselves to cursing people to speed them
along. We felt safe enough not only to buy water and give our clothes a
quick wash and dry, but to rent a couple of cubicles---men's and
women's---and sponge ourselves off from a basin of water each. That
settled the question of my sex for any of the new people who hadn't
already figured it out.

At last, somewhat cleaner, resupplied with food, water, ammunition for
all three guns, and, by the way, condoms for my own future, we headed
out of town. On our way, we passed through a small street market at the
edge of town. It was just a few people with their merchandise---mostly
junk---scattered on tables or on filthy rags spread on the bare asphalt.
Bankole spotted the rifle on one of the tables.

It was an antique---a bolt action Winchester, empty of course, with a
five-round capacity. It would be, as Bankole admitted, slow. But he
liked it. He inspected it with eyes and fingers and bargained with the
well-armed old man and woman who were offering it for sale. They had one
of the cleaner tables with merchandise laid out in a neat pattern---a
small, manual typewriter; a stack of books; a few hand tools, worn, but
clean; two knives in worn leather sheaths; a couple of pots, and the
rifle with sling and scope.

While Bankole haggled with the man over the rifle, I bought the pots
from the woman. I would get Bankole to carry them in his cart. They were
large enough to contain soup or stew or hot cereal for all of us at
once. We were nine now, and bigger pots made sense. Then I joined Harry
at the stack of books.

There was no nonfiction. I bought a fat anthology of poetry and Harry
bought a western novel. The others, either from lack of money or from
lack of interest ignored the books. I would have bought more if I could
have carried them. My pack was already about as heavy as I thought I
could stand, and still walk all day.

Our bargaining finished, we stood away from the table to wait for
Bankole. And Bankole surprised us.

He got the old man down to a price he seemed to think was fair, then he
called us over. "Any of you know how to handle a relic like this?" he
asked.

Well, Harry and I did, and he had us look the rifle over. In the end,
everyone had a look at it, some with obvious awkwardness and some with
familiarity. Back in the neighborhood, Harry and I had practiced with
the guns of other households---rifles and shotguns as well as handguns.
Whatever was legal back home was shared, at least in practice sessions.
My father had wanted us to be familiar with whatever weapons might be
available. Harry and I were both good, competent shots, but we'd never
bought a used gun. I liked the rifle, I liked the look and feel of it,
but that didn't mean much. Harry seemed to like it, too. Same problem.

"Come over here," Bankole said. He herded us out of earshot of the old
couple. "You should buy that gun," he told us. "You took enough money
off those four junkies to pay the price I got that guy to agree to. You
need at least one accurate, long-range weapon, and this is a good one."

"That money would buy a lot of food," Travis said.

Bankole nodded. "Yes, but only living people need food. You buy this,
and it will pay for itself the first time you need it. Anyone who
doesn't know how to use it, I'll teach. My father and I used to hunt
deer with guns just like this."

"It's an antique," Harry said. "If it were automatic ..."

"If it were automatic, you couldn't afford it." Bankole shrugged. "This
thing is cheap because it's old and it's legal."

"And it's slow," Zahra said. "And if you think that old guy's price is
cheap, you're crazy."

"I know I'm new here," Allie said, "but I agree with Bankole. You guys
are good with your handguns, but sooner or later, you're going to meet
someone who sits out of handgun range and picks you off. Picks us off."

"And this rifle is going to save us?" Zahra demanded.

"I doubt that it would save us," I said. "But with a decent shot behind
it, it might give us a chance." I looked at Bankole. "You hit any of
those deer?"

He smiled. "One or two."

I did not return the smile. "Why don't you buy the rifle for yourself?"

"I can't afford it," he said. "I've got enough money to keep me going
and take care of necessities for a while. Everything else that I had was
stolen from me or burned."

I didn't quite believe him. But then, no one knew how much money I had
either. In a way, I suppose he was asking about our solvency. Did we
have enough money to spend an unexpected windfall on an old rifle? And
what did he intend to do if we did? I hoped, not for the first time,
that he wasn't just a handsome thief. Yet I did like the gun, and we do
need it.

"Harry and I are decent shots, too," I said to the group. "I like the
feel of this gun, and it's the best we can afford right now. Has anyone
seen any real trouble with it?"

They looked at one another. No one answered.

"It just needs a cleaning and some 30-06 ammunition," Bankole said.
"It's been stored for a while, but it appears to have been well
maintained. If you buy it, I think I can manage to buy a cleaning kit
and some ammunition."

At that, I spoke up before anyone else could. "If we buy, that's a deal.
Who else can handle the rifle?"

"I can," Natividad said. And when that won her a few surprised looks,
she smiled. "I had no brothers. My father needed to teach someone."

"We never had a chance to do any shooting," Allie said. "But we can
learn."

Jill nodded. "I always wanted to learn," she said.

"I'll have to learn, too," Travis admitted. "Where I grew up, guns were
either locked away or carried by hired guards."

"Let's go buy it, then," I said. "And let's get out of here. The sun
will be down soon."

Bankole kept his word, bought cleaning things and plenty of
ammunition---insisted on buying them before we left town, because, as he
said, "Who knows when we'll need it, or when we'll find other people
willing to sell it to us."

Once that was settled, we left town.

As we left, Harry carried the new rifle and Zahra carried the Beretta,
both empty and in need of attention before we loaded them. Only Bankole
and I carried fully loaded guns. I led the group and he brought up the
rear. It was getting dark. Behind us in the distance, we could hear
gunfire and the dull thunder of small explosions.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Saturday, August 28, 2027

(from notes expanded Tuesday, August 31)

T[ODAY OR TOMORROW SHOULD]{.small} be a rest day, but we've agreed not
to rest. Last night was full of distant shooting, explosions and fire.
We could see fire behind us, though not in front. Moving on seems
sensible, in spite of our weariness.

Then, this morning, I cleaned the little black earring radio with
alcohol from my pack, turned the thing on, and put it in my ear. I had
to relay what it said since its sound could not reach the others.

What it said told us we should not only forget about resting, but change
our plans.

We had intended to follow U.S. 101 up through San Francisco and across
the Golden Gate Bridge. But the radio warned us to stay away from the
Bay Area. From San Jose up through San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley,
there is chaos. The quake hit hard up there, and the scavengers,
predators, cops, and private armies of security guards seem bent on
destroying what's left, Also, of course, pyro is doing its part. This
far north, the radio reporters shorten the name to "pro" or "ro" and
they say there are plenty of addicts.

Addicts are running wild, setting fires in areas that the earthquake
didn't damage. Bands of the street poor precede or follow them, grabbing
whatever they can from stores and from the walled enclaves of the rich
and what's left of the middle class. Yeah.

In some places, the rich are escaping by flying out in helicopters. The
bridges that are still intact---and most of them are---are guarded
either by the police or by gangs. Both groups are there to rob
desperate, fleeing people of their weapons, money, food, and water---at
the least. The penalty for being too poor to be worth robbing is a
beating, a rape, and/or death. The National Guard has been activated to
restore order, and I suppose it might. But I suspect that in the short
term, it will only add to the chaos. What else could another group of
well-armed people do in such an insane situation. The thoughtful ones
might take their guns and other equipment and vanish to help their
families. Others might find themselves at war with their own people.
They'll be confused and scared and dangerous. Of course, some will
discover that they enjoy their new power---the power to make others
submit, the power to take what they want---property, sex, life ...

Bad situation. The Bay Area will be a good place to avoid for a long
time.

We spread maps on the ground, studied them as we ate breakfast, and
decided to turn off U.S. 101 this morning. We'll follow a smaller, no
doubt emptier road inland to the little town of San Juan Bautista, then
east along State Route 156. From 156 to 152 to Interstate 5. We'll use
I-5 to circle around the Bay Area. For a time we'll walk up the center
of the state instead of along the coast. We might have to bypass I-5 and
go farther east to State 33 or 99. I like the emptiness around much of
I-5. Cities are dangerous. Even small towns can be deadly. Yet we have
to be able to re-supply. In particular, we have to be able to get water.
If that means going into the more populated areas around one of the
other highways, we'll do it. Meanwhile we'll be careful, resupply every
time we get a chance, never pass up a chance to top off our water and
food, waste nothing. But, hell, the maps are old. Maybe the area around
I-5 is more settled now.

To reach I-5, we'll pass a big freshwater lake---San Luis Reservoir. It
might be dry now. Over the past few years a lot of things had gone dry.
But there will be trees, cool shade, a place to rest and be comfortable.
Perhaps there will at least be a water station. If so, we'll camp there
and rest for a day or even two days. After hiking up and over a lot of
hills, we'll need the extra rest.

For now, I suspect that we'll soon have scavengers being driven north
toward us from Salinas, and refugees being driven south toward us from
the Bay Area. The best thing we can do is get out of the way.

We got an early start, fortified by the good food we had bought at
Salinas---some extra stuff that Bankole had wheeled in his cart, though
we all chipped in to buy it. We made sandwiches---dried beef, cheese,
sliced tomatoes---all on bread made from wheat flour. And we ate grapes.
It was a shame we had to hurry. We hadn't had anything that good tasting
for a long time.

The highway north was emptier today than I've ever seen it. We were the
biggest crowd around---eight adults and a baby---and other people kept
away from us. Several of the other walkers were individuals and couples
with children. They all seemed in a hurry---as though they, too, knew
what might be coming behind them. Did they also know what might be
ahead---what was ahead if they stayed on 101. Before we left 101 I tried
to warn a couple of women traveling alone with kids to avoid the Bay
Area. I told them I'd heard there was a lot of trouble up there---fires,
riots, bad quake damage. They just held on to their kids and edged away
from me.

Then we left 101 and took our small, hilly road, our short cut to San
Juan Bautista. The road was paved and not too badly broken up. It was
lonely. For long stretches we saw no one at all. No one had followed us
from 101. We passed farms, small communities, and shanties, and the
people living in these came out with their guns to stare at us. But they
let us alone. The shortcut worked. We managed to reach and pass through
San Juan Bautista before dark. We've camped just east of the town. We're
all exhausted, footsore, full of aches and pains and blisters. I long
for a rest day, but not yet. Not yet.

I put my sleepsack next to Bankole's and lay down, already half asleep.
We had drawn straws for the watch schedule, and my watch wasn't until
the early morning. I ate nuts and raisins, bread and cheese, and I slept
like a corpse.

Sunday, August 29, 2027

(from notes expanded Tuesday, August 31)

Early this morning I awoke to the sound of gunfire, nearby and loud.
Short bursts of automatic weapons fire. And there was light from
somewhere.

"Be still," someone said. "Stay down and keep quiet." Zahra's voice. She
had the watch just before mine.

"What is it?" one of the Gilchrists demanded. And then, "We've got to
get away!"

"Stay!" I whispered. "Be still, and it will pass."

I could see now that two groups were running from the highway---the
156---one group chasing the other, both firing their guns as though they
and their enemies were the only people in the world. We could only stay
down and hope they didn't shoot us by accident. If nobody moved,
accidents were less likely.

The light came from a fire burning some distance from us. Not buildings.
We hadn't camped near buildings. Yet something was burning. It was, I
decided, a big truck of some kind. Perhaps that was the reason for the
shooting. Someone, some group had tried to hijack a truck on the highway
and things had gone wrong. Now, whatever the truck was carrying---food,
I suspected---the fire would get it. Neither the hijackers nor the
defenders would win.

We would win if we could just keep out of the fighting.

I reached over to feel for Bankole, wanting assurance that he was all
right.

He wasn't there.

His sleepsack and his things were still there, but he was gone.

Moving as little as I could, I looked toward our designated toilet area.
He must be there. I couldn't see him, but where else could he be? Bad
timing. I squinted, trying to pick him out, not knowing whether to be
glad or afraid because I couldn't. After all, if I could see him, so
could other people.

The shooting went on and on while we lay still and quiet and scared. One
of the trees we'd camped under was hit twice, but well above our heads.

Then the truck exploded. I don't know what exploded in it. It hadn't
looked like an old truck---one of those that used diesel fuel, but it
might have been. Would diesel fuel explode? I didn't know.

The explosion seemed to end the gunfight. A few more shots were
exchanged, then nothing. I saw people, visible in the firelight, walking
back toward the truck. Sometime later, I saw others---several together
in a bunch---moving away toward the town. Both groups were moving away
from us, and that was good.

Now. Where was Bankole? In as low a voice as I could manage, I spoke to
the others. "Can anyone see Bankole?"

No answer.

"Zahra, did you see him go?"

"Yeah, a couple of minutes before the shooting started," she answered.

All right. If he didn't come out soon, we would have to go looking for
him. I swallowed, tried not to think about finding him hurt or dead. "Is
everyone else all right?" I asked. "Zahra?"

"I'm fine."

"Harry?"

"Yeah," he said. "I'm okay."

"Travis? Natividad?"

"We're all right," Travis said.

"What about Dominic?"

"Didn't even wake up."

That was good. If he had, his crying could have gotten us killed.
"Allie? Jill?"

"We're okay," Allie said.

I sat up, keeping my movements slow and cautious. I couldn't see anyone
or hear anything beyond insects and the distant fire. When no one shot
me, others sat up, too. Where noise and light had not awakened Dominic,
his mother's movement did the trick. He awoke and began to whimper, but
Natividad held him and he quieted.

But still no Bankole. I wanted to get up and go looking for him. I had
two mental images of him: One of him lying wounded or dead, and one of
him crouching behind a tree holding his own Beretta nine millimeter. If
the latter was true, I could scare him into shooting me. There might
also be other people out there with ready guns and frayed nerves.

"What time is it?" I asked Zahra who had Harry's watch.

"Three-forty," she said.

"Let me have the gun," I said. "Your watch is almost over anyway."

"What about Bankole?" She passed both the watch and the gun over.

"If he isn't back in five minutes I'm going to go look for him."

"Wait a minute," Harry said. "You aren't going to do that by yourself.
I'll go with you."

I almost said no. I don't think he would have paid any attention if I
had, but I never spoke the word. If Bankole were injured and conscious,
I would be useless the moment I saw him. I would be lucky to drag myself
back to camp. Someone else would have to drag him back.

"Thank you," I said to Harry.

Five minutes later, he and I went first to the toilet area, then around
it, searching. There was no one, or rather, we could see no one. Still,
there might be other people around---others camping overnight, others
involved in the shooting, others prowling. ... Still, I called Bankole's
name once, aloud. I touched Harry as a kind of warning and he jumped,
settled, then jumped again as I said the name. We both listened in
absolute silence.

There was a rustling off to our right where there were several trees
blotting out the stars, creating a space of impenetrable darkness.
Anything could be there.

The rustling came again, and with it a whimper---a child's whimper. Then
Bankole's voice:

"Olamina!"

"Yes," I answered, almost limp with relief. "Here!"

He came out of the pool of darkness, a tall, broad shadow that seemed
bulkier than it should have been. He was carrying something.

"I have an orphaned child," he said. "The mother was hit by a stray
bullet. She just died."

I sighed. "Is the child hurt?"

"No, just scared. I'll carry him back to our camp. Will one of you get
his things?"

"Take us to his camp," I said.

Harry collected the child's things, and I collected the mother's and
searched her body. Between us, we gathered everything. By the time we
finished, the little boy, perhaps three years old, was crying. That
scared me. I left Harry to push the dead woman's pack along in her baby
carriage and Bankole to carry the whimpering child. All I carried was
the gun, drawn and ready. Even when we got back to our own camp, I
couldn't relax. The little boy wouldn't be quiet and Dominic joined him
with even louder cries. Zahra and Jill worked to comfort the new child,
but he was surrounded by strangers in the middle of the night, and he
wanted his mother!

I saw movement over near the burned out carcass of the truck. The fire
was still burning, but it was smaller now, burning itself out. There
were still people near it. They had lost their truck. Would they care
about a crying child? And if they did care, would they want to help the
kid or just shut its mouth?

A lone, dark figure came away from the truck and took several steps
toward us. At that moment, Natividad took the new child, and in spite of
his age, gave him one breast and Dominic the other.

It worked. Both children were comforted almost at once. They made a few
more small sounds, then settled down to nursing.

The shadow figure from the truck stood still, perhaps confused now that
it was no longer guided by noise. After a moment, it turned and went
back past the truck and out of sight. Gone. It couldn't have seen us. We
could look out of the darkness under the trees that sheltered our
campsite and see by firelight, by starlight. But others could only
follow the baby noise to us.

"We ought to move," Allie whispered. "Even if they can't see us, they
know we're here."

"Watch with me," I said.

"What?"

"Stay awake and watch with me. Let the others get a little more rest.
Trying to move in the dark is more dangerous than staying put."

"... all right. But I don't have a gun."

"Do you have a knife?"

"Yeah."

"That will have to be enough until we get the other guns clean and
ready." We've been too tired and in too much of a hurry to do that so
far. Also, I don't want Allie or Jill to have guns yet. Not yet. "Just
keep your eyes open." The only real defense against automatic rifles is
concealment and silence.

"A knife is better than a gun now," Zahra said. "If you have to use it,
it will be quiet."

I nodded. "The rest of you, try to get a little more rest. I'll wake you
at dawn."

Most of them lay down to sleep, or at least to rest. Natividad kept both
children with her. Tomorrow, though, one of us would have to take charge
of the little boy. We didn't need the burden of such a big child---one
who had reached the "run around and grab everything" stage. But we had
the little boy, and there was no one to hand him off to. No woman
camping alongside a highway with her child would have other relatives
handy.

"Olamina," Bankole said into my ear. His voice was low and soft and only
I reacted to it. I turned, and he was so close that I felt his beard
brush my face. Soft, thick beard. This morning he combed it more
carefully than he combed the hair on his head. He has the only mirror
among us. Vain, vain old man. I moved almost by reflex toward him.

I kissed him, wondering what it would feel like to kiss so much beard. I
did kiss the beard at first, missing his mouth by a little in the dark.
Then I found it and he moved a little and slipped his arms around me and
we settled to it for a little while.

It was hard for me to make myself push him away. I didn't want to. He
didn't want to let me.

"I was going to say thank you for coming after me," he said. "That woman
was conscious almost until she died. The only thing I could do for her
was stay with her."

"I was afraid you might have been shot out there."

"I was flat on the ground until I heard the woman groaning."

I sighed. "Yeah." And then, "Rest."

He lay down next to me and rubbed my arm---which tingled wherever he
touched it. "We should talk soon," he said.

"At least," I agreed.

He grinned---I could see the flash of teeth---and turned over and tried
to sleep.

The boy's name was Justin Rohr. His dead mother had been Sandra Rohr.
Justin had been born in Riverside, California just three years ago. His
mother had gotten him this far north from Riverside. She had saved his
birth certificate, some baby pictures, and a picture of a stocky,
freckled, red-haired man who was, according to a notation on the back of
the photo, Richard Walter Rohr, born January 9, 2002, and died May 20,
2026. The boy's father---only twenty-four when he died. I wondered what
had killed him. Sandra Rohr had saved her marriage certificate and other
papers important to her. All were wrapped in a plastic packet that I had
taken from her body. Elsewhere on her, I had found several thousand
dollars and a gold ring.

There was nothing about relatives or a specific destination. It seemed
that Sandra had simply been heading north with her son in search of a
better life.

The little boy tolerated us all well enough today, although he got
frustrated when we didn't understand him at once. When he cried, he
demanded that we produce his mother.

Allie, of all people, was his choice for substitute mother. She resisted
him at first. She ignored him or pushed him away. But when he was not
being wheeled along, he chose to walk with her or demand to be carried
by her. By the end of the day, she had given in. The two of them had
chosen each other.

"She used to have a little boy," her sister Jill told me as we walked
along State 156 with the few other walkers who had chosen this route. It
was empty. There were times when we could see no one at all, or when, as
we headed east and north, the only people we could see were heading west
and south toward us, toward the coast.

"She called her little boy Adam," Jill continued. "He was only a few
months old when ... he died."

I looked at her. She had a big swollen purple bruise in the middle of
her forehead, like a misshapen third eye. I don't think it hurt her
much, though. It didn't hurt me much.

"When he died," I repeated. "Who killed him?"

She looked away and rubbed her bruise. "Our father. That's why we left.
He killed the baby. It cried. He hit it with his fists until it
stopped."

I shook my head and sighed. It was no news to me that other people's
fathers could be monsters. I'd heard about such things all my life, but
I'd never before met people who were so clearly their father's victims.

"We burned the house," Jill whispered. I heard her say it, and I knew
without asking what she wasn't saying. But she looked like a person
talking to herself, forgetting that anyone was listening. "He was passed
out drunk on the floor. The baby was dead. We got our stuff and our
money---we earned it!---and we set fire to the trash on the floor and
the couch. We didn't stay to see. I don't know what happened. We ran
away. Maybe the fire went out. Maybe he didn't die." She focused on me.
"He might still be alive."

She sounded more scared than anything else. Not hopeful or sorry.
Scared. The devil might still be alive.

"Where did you run from?" I asked. "What city?"

"Glendale."

"Way down in L.A. County?"

"Yeah."

"Then he's more than three hundred miles behind you."

"... yeah."

"He drank a lot, didn't he."

"All the time."

"Then he'd be in no shape to follow you even if the fire never touched
him. What do you think would happen to a drunk on the highway? He'd
never even make it out of L.A."

She nodded. "You sound like Allie. You're both right. I know. But ... I
dream about him sometimes---that he's coming, that he's found us. ... I
know it's crazy. But I wake up covered in sweat."

"Yeah," I said, remembering my own nightmares during the search for my
father. "Yeah."

Jill and I walked together for a while without talking. We were moving
slowly because Justin demanded to be allowed to walk now and then. He
had too much energy to spend hours sitting and riding. And, of course,
when he was allowed to walk, he wanted to run all around, investigate
everything. I had time to stop, swing my pack around, and dig out a
length of clothesline. I handed it to Jill.

"Tell your sister to try harnessing him with this," I said. "It might
save his life. One end around his waist, the other around her arm."

She took the rope.

"I've taken care of a few three-year-olds," I said, "and I'll tell you,
she's going to need a lot of help with that little kid. If she doesn't
know that now, she will."

"Are you guys just going to leave all the work to her?" Jill demanded.

"Of course not." I watched Allie and Justin walking along---lean,
angular woman and pudgy, bumblebee of a child. The boy ran to
investigate a bush near the roadside, then, startled by the approach of
strangers, ran back to Allie and hung on to the cloth of her jeans until
she took his hand. "They do seem to be adopting each other, though," I
said. "And taking care of other people can be a good cure for nightmares
like yours and maybe hers."

"You sound as though you know."

I nodded. "I live in this world, too."

We passed through Hollister before noon. We resupplied there, not
knowing when we would see well-equipped stores again. We had already
discovered that several of the small communities shown on the maps no
longer existed---had not existed for years. The earthquake had done a
lot of damage in Hollister, but the people hadn't gone animal. They
seemed to be helping one another with repairs and looking after their
own destitute. Imagine that.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Monday, August 30, 2027

T[HERE IS STILL A]{.small} little water in the San Luis Reservoir. It's
more fresh water than I've ever seen in one place, but by the vast size
of the reservoir, I can see that it's only a little compared to what
should be there---what used to be there.

The highway runs through the recreational area for several miles. That
gave us a chance to travel through on the road until we spotted an area
that would make a good rest-day camp and that wasn't occupied.

There are a lot of people in the area---people who have set up permanent
camps in everything from rag-and-plastic tents to wooden shacks that
look almost fit for human habitation. Where are so many people going to
the bathroom? How clean is the water in the reservoir? No doubt cities
that use it purify the water when it reaches them. Whether they do or
not, I think it's time for us to break out the water purification
tablets.

Around several of the tents and shacks, there are small, ragged
gardens---new plantings and remnants of summer vegetable gardens. There
are a few things left to harvest: big squashes, pumpkins, and gourds
still growing along with carrots, peppers, greens, and a little corn.
Good, cheap, filling foods. Not enough protein, but perhaps the people
hunt. There must be game around here, and I saw plenty of guns. People
wear holstered handguns or carry rifles or shotguns. The men in
particular go armed.

They all stared at us.

As we went past, people stopped their gardening, outdoor cooking, or
whatever to stare at us. We had pushed ourselves, had been eager to
arrive ahead of the crowd I believe will soon come in from the Bay Area.
So we didn't arrive with the usual human river. Yet by ourselves we are
enough of a crowd to make the local squatters nervous. They let us
alone, though. Except during disaster-induced feeding frenzies like the
ones after the earthquake, most people let one another alone. I think
Dominic and Justin are making it easier for us to fit in. Justin, now
tethered to Allie's wrist, runs around staring at the squatters until
they make him nervous. Then he runs back to Allie and demands to be
carried. He's a cute little kid. Lean, grim-faced people tend to smile
at him.

No one shot at us or challenged us as we walked along the highway. No
one bothered us later when we left the highway and headed into the trees
toward what we thought might be a good area. We found old campsites and
toilet places and avoided them. We didn't want to be within sight of the
highway or of anyone else's tent or shack. We wanted privacy, not too
many rocks to sleep on, and a way of reaching the water that didn't put
us too much on display. We looked for over an hour until we found an
isolated old campsite, long abandoned and a little higher upslope than
others we'd seen. It suited all of us. Then, with hours of daylight
left, we rested in enormous comfort and laziness, knowing we had the
rest of today and all of tomorrow to do almost nothing. Natividad fed
Dominic and the two of them drifted off to sleep. Allie followed her
example with Justin, although preparing him a meal was a little more
complicated. Both women had more reason to be tired and to need sleep
than the rest of us, so we left them out when we drew lots for a watch
schedule---one for day and night. We shouldn't get *too* comfortable.
Also, we agreed that no one should go off exploring or getting water
alone. I thought the couples would soon start going off together---And I
thought it was just about time for Bankole and me to have that talk.

I sat with him and cleaned our new handgun while he cleaned the rifle.
Harry was on watch and needed my gun. When I went over to give it to
him, he let me know he understood exactly what was going on between
Bankole and me.

"Be careful," he whispered. "Don't give the poor old guy a heart
attack."

"I'll tell him you were worried," I said.

Harry laughed, then sobered. "Be careful, Lauren. Bankole is probably
all right. He seems to be. But, well. ... Yell if anything goes wrong."

I rested my hand on his shoulder for a moment and said, "Thank you."

The nice thing about sitting and working alongside someone you don't
know very well, someone you'd like to know much better, is that you can
talk with him or be quiet with him. You can get comfortable with him and
with the awareness that you'll soon be making love to him.

Bankole and I were quiet for a while, a little shy. I sneaked glances at
him and caught him sneaking glances at me. Then, to my own surprise, I
began to talk to him about Earthseed---not preaching, just talking,
testing I guess. I needed to see his reaction. Earthseed is the most
important thing in my life. If Bankole were going to laugh at it, I
needed to know now. I didn't expect him to agree with it or even to be
much interested in it. He's an old man. I thought he was probably
content with whatever religion he had. It occurred to me as I spoke that
I had no idea what his religion was. I asked him.

"None at all," he said. "When my wife was alive, we went to a Methodist
church. Her religion was important to her, so I went along. I saw how it
comforted her, and I wanted to believe, but I never could."

"We were Baptists," I said. "I couldn't make myself believe either, and
I couldn't tell anyone. My father was the minister. I kept quiet and
began to understand Earthseed."

"Began to invent Earthseed," he said.

"Began to discover it and understand it," I said. "Stumbling across the
truth isn't the same as making things up." I wondered how many times and
ways I would have to say this to new people.

"It sounds like some combination of Buddhism, existentialism, Sufism,
and I don't know what else," he said. "Buddhism doesn't make a god of
the concept of change, but the impermanence of everything is a basic
Buddhist principle."

"I know," I said. "I've done a lot of reading. Some other religions and
philosophies do contain ideas that would fit into Earthseed, but none of
them *are* Earthseed. They go off in their own directions."

He nodded. "All right. But tell me, what do people have to do to be good
members of an Earthseed Community?"

A nice, door-opening question. "The essentials," I answered, "are to
learn to shape God with forethought, care, and work; to educate and
benefit their community, their families, and themselves; and to
contribute to the fulfillment of the Destiny."

"And why should people bother about the Destiny, farfetched as it is?
What's in it for them?"

"A unifying, purposeful life here on Earth, and the hope of heaven for
themselves and their children. A real heaven, not mythology or
philosophy. A heaven that will be theirs to shape."

"Or a hell," he said. His mouth twitched. "Human beings are good at
creating hells for themselves even out of richness." He thought for a
moment. "It sounds too simple, you know."

"You think it's simple?" I asked in surprise.

"I said it *sounds* too simple."

"It sounds overwhelming to some people."

"I mean it's too ... straightforward. If you get people to accept it,
they'll make it more complicated, more open to interpretation, more
mystical, and more comforting."

"Not around me they won't!" I said.

"With you or without you, they will. All religions change. Think about
the big ones. What do you think Christ would be these days? A Baptist? A
Methodist? A Catholic? And the Buddha---do you think he'd be a Buddhist
now? What kind of Buddhism would he practice?" He smiled. "After all, if
'God is Change,' surely Earthseed can change, and if it lasts, it will."

I looked away from him because he was smiling. This was all nothing to
him. "I know," I said. "No one can stop Change, but we all shape Change
whether we mean to or not. I mean to guide and shape Earthseed into what
it should be."

"Perhaps." He went on smiling. "How serious are you about this?"

The question drove me deep into myself. I spoke, almost not knowing what
I would say. "When my father ... disappeared," I began, "it was
Earthseed that kept me going. When most of my community and the rest of
my family were wiped out, and I was alone, I still had Earthseed. What I
am now, all that I am now is Earthseed."

"What you are now," he said after a long silence, "is a very unusual
young woman."

We didn't talk for a while after that. I wondered what he thought. He
hadn't seemed to be bottling up *too* much hilarity. No more than I'd
expected. He had been willing to go along with his wife's religious
needs. Now, he would at least permit me mine.

I wondered about his wife. He hadn't mentioned her before. What had she
been like? How had she died?

"Did you leave home because your wife died?" I asked.

He put down a long slender cleaning rod and rested his back against the
tree behind him. "My wife died five years ago," he said. "Three men
broke in---junkies, dealers, I don't know. They beat her, tried to make
her tell where the drugs were."

"Drugs?"

"They had decided that we must have something they could use or sell.
They didn't like the things she was able to give them so they kept
beating her. She had a heart problem." He drew in a long breath, then
sighed. "She was still alive when I got home. She was able to tell me
what had happened. I tried to help her, but the bastards had taken her
medicine, taken everything. I phoned for an ambulance. It arrived an
hour after she died. I tried to save her, then to revive her. I tried so
damned hard. ..."

I stared down the hill from our camp where just a glint of water was
visible in the distance through the trees and bushes. The world is full
of painful stories. Sometimes it seems as though there aren't any other
kind and yet I found myself thinking how beautiful that glint of water
was through the trees.

"I should have headed north when Sharon died," Bankole said. "I thought
about it."

"But you stayed." I turned away from the water and looked at him. "Why?"

He shook his head. "I didn't know what to do, so for some time I didn't
do anything. Friends took care of me, cooked for me, cleaned the house.
It surprised me that they would do that. Church people most of them.
Neighbors. More her friends than mine."

I thought of Wardell Parrish, devastated after the loss of his sister
and her children---and his house. Had Bankole been some community's
Wardell Parrish? "Did you live in a walled community?" I asked.

"Yes. Not rich, though. Nowhere near rich. People managed to hold on to
their property and feed their families. Not much else. No servants. No
hired guards."

"Sounds like my old neighborhood."

"I suppose it sounds like a lot of old neighborhoods that aren't there
any more. I stayed to help the people who had helped me. I couldn't walk
away from them."

"But you did. You left. Why?"

"Fire---and scavengers."

"You, too? Your whole community?"

"Yes. The houses burned, most of the people were killed. ... The rest
scattered, went to family or friends elsewhere. Scavengers and squatters
moved in. I didn't decide to leave. I escaped."

Much too familiar. "Where did you live? What city?"

"San Diego."

"That far south?"

"Yes. As I said, I should have left years ago. If I had, I could have
managed plane fare and resettlement money."

Plane fare *and* resettlement money? He might not call that rich, but we
would have.

"Where are you going now?" I asked.

"North." He shrugged.

"Just anywhere north or somewhere in particular?"

"Anywhere where I can be paid for my services and allowed to live among
people who aren't out to kill me for my food or water."

Or for drugs, I thought. I looked into his bearded face and added up the
hints I'd picked up today and over the past few days. "You're a doctor,
aren't you?"

He looked a little surprised. "I was, yes. Family practice. It seems a
long time ago."

"People will always need doctors," I said. "You'll do all right."

"My mother used to say that." He gave me a wry smile. "But here I am."

I smiled back because, looking at him now, I couldn't help myself, but
as he spoke, I decided he had told me at least one lie. He might be as
displaced and in distress as he appeared to be, but he wasn't just
wandering north. He wasn't looking for just anywhere he could be paid
for his services and not robbed or murdered. He wasn't the kind of man
who wandered. He knew where he was going. He had a haven somewhere---a
relative's home, another home of his own, a friend's home,
*something*---some definite destination.

Or perhaps he just had enough money to buy a place for himself in
Washington or Canada or Alaska. He had had to choose between fast, safe,
expensive air travel and having settling-in money when he got where he
was going. He had chosen settling-in money. If so, I agreed with him. He
was taking the kind of risk that would enable him to make a new
beginning as soon as possible---if he survived.

On the other hand, if I were right about any of this, he might disappear
on me some night. Or perhaps he would be more open about it---just walk
away from me some day, turn down a side road and wave good-bye. I didn't
want that. After I'd slept with him I would want it even less.

Even now, I wanted to keep him with me. I hated that he was lying to me
already---or I believed he was. But why should he tell me everything? He
didn't know me very well yet, and like me, he meant to survive. Perhaps
I could convince him that he and I could survive well together.
Meanwhile, best to enjoy him without quite trusting him. I may be wrong
about all this, but I don't believe I am. Pity.

We finished the guns, loaded them, and went down to the water to wash.
You could go right down to the water, scoop some up in a pot, and take
it away. It was free. I kept looking around, thinking someone would come
to stop us or charge us or something. I suppose we could have been
robbed, but no one paid any attention to us. We saw other people getting
water in bottles, canteens, pots, and bags, but the place seemed
peaceful. No one bothered anyone. No one paid any attention to us.

"A place like this can't last," I told Bankole. "It's a shame. Life
could be good here."

"I suspect that it's against the law to live here," he said. "This is a
State Recreation Area. There should be some kind of limit on how long
you can stay. I'm certain that there should be---used to be---some group
policing the place. I wonder if officials of some kind come around to
collect bribes now and then."

"Not while we're here, I hope." I dried my hands and arms and waited for
him to dry his. "Are you hungry?" I asked.

"Oh, yes," he said. He looked at me for a while, then reached for me. He
took me by both arms, drew me to him, kissed me, and spoke into my ear.
"Aren't you?"

I didn't say anything. After a while I took his hand and we went back to
camp to pick up one of his blankets. Then we went to an isolated little
spot that we'd both noticed earlier.

It felt natural and easy to lie down with him, and explore the smooth,
hard, broad feel of his body. He'd kept himself fit. No doubt walking
hundreds of miles in the past few weeks had burned off whatever fat he'd
been carrying. He was still big---barrel-chested and tall. Best of all,
he took a lot of uncomplicated pleasure in my body, and I got to share
it with him. It isn't often that I can enjoy the good side of my
hyperempathy. I let the sensation take over, intense and wild. I might
be more in danger of having a heart attack than he is. How had I done
without this for so long?

There was an odd, unromantic moment when we both reached into crumpled
clothing and produced condoms. It was funny because of the way it hit us
both at once, and we laughed, then went on to the serious business of
loving and pleasuring one another. That combed and trimmed beard that
he's so vain about tickles like mad.

"I knew I should have let you alone," he said to me when we had made
love twice and were still not willing to get up and go back to the
others. "You're going to kill me. I'm too old for this stuff."

I laughed and made a pillow of his shoulder.

After a while, he said, "I need to be serious for a minute, girl."

"Okay."

He drew a long breath, sighed, swallowed, hesitated. "I don't want to
give you up," he said.

I smiled.

"You're a kid," he said. "I ought to know better. How old are you,
anyway?"

I told him.

He jumped, then pushed me off his shoulder. "Eighteen?" He flinched away
from me as though my skin burned him. "My god," he said. "You're a baby!
I'm a child molester!"

I didn't laugh, though I wanted to. I just looked at him.

After a while he frowned and shook his head. In a little more time, he
moved back against me, touching my face, my shoulders, my breasts.

"You're not just eighteen," he said.

I shrugged.

"When were you born? What year?"

"Twenty oh nine."

"No." He drew the word out: "Nooo."

I kissed him and said in the same tone, "Yesss. Now stop your nonsense.
You want to be with me and I want to be with you. We're not going to
split up because of my age, are we?"

After a while he shook his head. "You should have a nice youngster like
Travis," he said. "I should have the sense and the strength to send you
off to find one."

That made me think of Curtis, and I cringed away from thinking of him.
I've thought as little as possible about Curtis Talcott. He isn't like
my brothers. He may be dead, but none of us ever saw his body. I saw his
brother Michael. I was terrified of seeing Curtis himself, but I never
did. He may not be dead. He's lost to me, but I hope he's not dead. He
should be here with me on the road. I hope he's alive and all right.

"Who have I reminded you of?" Bankole asked me, his voice soft and deep.

I shook my head. "A boy I knew at home. We were going to get married
this year. I don't even know whether he's still alive."

"You loved him?"

"Yes! We were going to marry and leave home, walk north. We had decided
to go this fall."

"That's crazy! You intended to walk this road even though you didn't
have to?"

"Yes. And if we had left earlier, he'd be with me. I wish I knew he was
all right."

He lay down on his back and drew me down beside him. "We've all lost
someone," he said. "You and I seem to have lost everyone. That's a bond,
I suppose."

"A terrible one," I said. "But not our only one."

He shook his head. "You're really eighteen?"

"Yes. As of last month."

"You look and act years older."

"This is who I am," I said.

"You were the oldest kid in your family, weren't you?"

I nodded. "I had four brothers. They're all dead."

"Yes," he sighed. "Yes."

Tuesday, August 31, 2027

I've spent all of today talking, writing, reading, and making love to
Bankole. It seems such a luxury not to have to get up, pack, and walk
all day. We all lay sprawled around the campsite resting aching muscles,
eating, and doing nothing. More people flowed into the area from the
highway and made their camps, but none of them bothered us.

I began Zahra's reading lesson and Jill and Allie looked interested. I
included them as though I had intended to from the first. It turned out
that they could read a little, but hadn't learned to write. Toward the
end of the lesson, I read a few Earthseed verses to them in spite of
Harry's groans. Yet when Allie proclaimed that she would never pray to
any god of change, Harry was the one who corrected her. Zahra and Travis
both smiled at that, and Bankole watched us all with apparent interest.

After that, Allie began to ask questions instead of making scornful
proclamations, and for the most part, the others answered her---Travis
and Natividad, Harry and Zahra. Once Bankole answered, expanding on
something I told him yesterday. Then he caught himself and looked a
little embarrassed.

"I still think it's too simple," he said to me. "A lot of it is logical,
but it will never work without a sprinkling of mystical confusion."

"I'll leave that to my descendants," I said, and he busied himself,
digging a bag of almonds out of his pack, pouring some into his hand,
and passing the rest around.

Just before nightfall a gun battle began over toward the highway. We
couldn't see any of it from where we were, but we stopped talking and
lay down. With bullets flying, it seemed best to keep low.

The shooting started and stopped, moved away, then came back. I was on
watch, so I had to stay alert, but in this storm of noise, nothing moved
near us except the trees in the evening breeze. It looked so peaceful,
and yet people out there were trying to kill each other, and no doubt
succeeding. Strange how normal it's become for us to lie on the ground
and listen while nearby, people try to kill each other.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Thursday, September 9, 2027

W[E'VE HAD OVER A]{.small} week of weary, frightening, nerve-wracking
walking. We've reached and passed through the city of Sacramento without
real trouble. We've been able to buy enough food and water, been able to
find plenty of empty places in the hills where we could make camp. Yet
none of us have had any feelings of comfort or well-being along the
stretch of Interstate-5 that we've just traveled.

I-5 is much less traveled than U.S. 101, in spite of the earthquake
chaos. There were times when the only people we could see were each
other. Those times never lasted long, but they did happen.

On the other hand, there were more trucks on I-5. We had to be careful
because trucks traveled during the day as well as at night. Also, there
were more human bones on I-5. It was nothing to run across skulls, lower
jaws, or bones of the pelvis and torso. Arm and leg bones were rarer,
but now and then, we spotted them, too.

"I think it's the trucks," Bankole told us. "If they hit someone along
here, they wouldn't stop. They wouldn't dare. And the junkies and
alcoholics wouldn't be that careful where they walked."

I suppose he's right, although along that whole empty stretch of road,
we saw only four people whom I believed were either not sober or not
sane.

But we saw other things. On Tuesday we camped in a little hollow back in
the hills to the west of the road, and a big black and white dog came
wandering down toward our camp with the fresh-looking, bloody hand and
forearm of a child in its mouth.

The dog spotted us, froze, turned, and ran back the way it had come. But
we all got a good look before it went, and we all saw the same thing.
That night, we posted a double watch. Two watchers, two guns, no
unnecessary conversation, no sex.

The next day we decided not to take another rest day until we had passed
through Sacramento. There was no guarantee that anything would be better
on the other side of Sacramento, but we wanted to get away from this
grim land.

That night, looking for a place to camp, we stumbled across four ragged,
filthy kids huddled around a campfire. The picture of them is still
clear in my mind. Kids the age of my brothers---twelve, thirteen, maybe
fourteen years old, three boys and a girl. The girl was pregnant, and so
huge it was obvious she would be giving birth any day. We rounded a bend
in a dry stream bed, and there these kids were, roasting a severed human
leg, maneuvering it where it lay in the middle of their fire atop the
burning wood by twisting its foot. As we watched, the girl pulled a
sliver of charred flesh from the thigh and stuffed it into her mouth.

They never saw us. I was in the lead, and I stopped the others before
they all rounded the bend. Harry and Zahra, who were just behind me, saw
all that I saw. We turned the others back and away, not telling them why
until we were far from those kids and their cannibal feast.

No one attacked us. No one bothered us at all. The country we walked
through was even beautiful in some places---green trees and rolling
hills; golden dried grasses and tiny communities; farms, many overgrown
and abandoned, and abandoned houses. Nice country, and compared to
Southern California, rich country. More water, more food, more room. ...

So why were the people eating one another?

There were several burned out buildings. It was obvious that there had
been trouble here, too, but much less than on the coast. Yet we couldn't
wait to get back to the coast.

Sacramento was all right to resupply in and hurry through. Water and
food were cheap there compared to what you could buy along the roadside,
of course. Cities were always a relief as far as prices went. But cities
were also dangerous. More gangs, more cops, more suspicious, nervous
people with guns. You tiptoe through cities. You keep up a steady pace,
keep your eyes open, and try to look both too intimidating to bother and
invisible. Neat trick. Bankole says cities have been like that for a
long time.

Speaking of Bankole, I haven't let him get much rest on this rest day.
He doesn't seem to mind. He did say something that I should make note
of, though. He said he wanted me to leave the group with him. He has, as
I suspected, a safe haven---or as safe as any haven can be that isn't
surrounded by high-tech security devices and armed guards. It's in the
hills on the coast near Cape Mendocino maybe two weeks from here.

"My sister and her family have been living there," he said. "But the
property belongs to me. There's room on it for you."

I could imagine how delighted his sister would be to see me. Would she
try to be polite, or would she stare at me, then at him, then demand to
know whether he was in his right mind?

"Did you hear what I said?" he demanded.

I looked at him, interested in the anger I heard in his voice. Why
anger?

"What am I doing? Boring you?" he demanded.

I took his hand and kissed it. "You introduce me to your sister and
she'll measure you for a straitjacket."

After a while, he laughed. "Yes." And then, "I don't care."

"You might, sooner or later."

"You'll come with me, then."

"No. I'd like to, but no."

He smiled. "Yes. You'll come."

I watched him. I tried to read the smile, but it's hard to read a
bearded face. It's easier to say what I didn't see---or didn't
recognize. I didn't see condescension or that particular kind of
disregard that some men reserve for women. He wasn't deciding that my
"no" was a secret "yes." Something else was going on.

"I own three hundred acres," he said. "I bought the property years ago
as an investment. There was going to be a big housing development up
there, and speculators like me were going to make tons of money, selling
our land to the developers. The project fell through for some reason,
and I was stuck with land that I could either sell at a loss or keep. I
kept it. Most of it is good for farming. It's got some trees on it, and
some big tree stumps. My sister and her husband have built a house and a
few outbuildings."

"You might have dozens or hundreds of squatters on that land now," I
said.

"I don't think so. Access is a problem. It's not convenient to any real
road, and it's well away from the big highways. It's a great place to
hide."

"Water?"

"There are wells. My sister says the area is getting dryer, warmer.
That's no surprise. But the ground water seems dependable so far."

I thought I could see where he was headed now, but he was going to have
to get there all by himself. His land; his choice.

"There aren't many black people up that way, are there?" I asked.

"Not many," he agreed. "My sister hasn't had much trouble, though."

"What does she do for a living? Farm the land?"

"Yes, and her husband does odd jobs for cash---which is dangerous
because it leaves her and the children alone for days, weeks, even
months at a time. If we can manage to support ourselves without becoming
a drain on her few resources, we might be useful to her. We might give
her more security."

"How many kids?"

"Three. Let's see ... eleven, thirteen, and fifteen years old by now.
She's only forty herself." His mouth twitched. Only. Yeah. Even his
little sister was old enough to be my mother. "Her name's Alex.
Alexandra. Married to Don Casey. They both hate cities. They thought my
land was a godsend. They could raise children who might live to grow
up." He nodded. "And their children have done all right."

"How have you kept in touch?" I asked. "Phone?"

"That was part of our agreement," he said. "They don't have a phone, but
when Don goes to one of the towns to get work, he phones me and lets me
know how everyone is. He won't know what's happened to me. He won't be
expecting me. If he's tried to phone, both he and Alex will be worried."

"You should have flown up," I said. "But I'm glad you didn't."

"Are you? So am I. Listen, you are coming with me. I can't think of
anything I want as much as I want you. I haven't wanted anything at all
for a long time. Too long."

I leaned back against a tree. Our campsite wasn't as completely private
as the one at San Luis had been, but there were trees, and the couples
could get away from each other. Each couple had one gun, and the
Gilchrist sisters were babysitting Dominic as well as Justin. We had put
them in the middle of a rough triangle and given them my gun. On I-5
they and Travis had had a chance to do a little target practice. It was
all of our duty to look around now and then and make sure no strangers
wandered into the area. I looked around.

Sitting up I could see Justin running around, chasing pigeons. Jill was
keeping an eye on him, but not trying to keep up with him.

Bankole took me by the shoulder and turned me to face him. "I'm not
boring you, am I?" he asked for the second time.

I had been trying not to look at him. I looked now, but he had not yet
said what he had to say if he wanted to keep me with him. Did he know? I
thought he did.

"I want to go with you," I said. "But I'm serious about Earthseed. I
couldn't be more serious. You have to understand that." Why did this
sound strange to me? It was the absolute truth, but I felt odd telling
it.

"I know my rival," he said.

Maybe that's why it sounded strange. I was telling him there was someone
else---something else. Maybe it would have sounded less strange if the
something were another man.

"You could help me," I said.

"Help you what? Do you have any real idea what you want to do?"

"Begin the first Earthseed Community."

He sighed.

"You could help me," I repeated. "This world is falling apart. You could
help me begin something purposeful and constructive."

"Going to fix the world, are you?" he said with quiet amusement.

I looked at him. For a moment I was too angry to let myself speak. When
I could control my voice, I said, "It's all right if you don't believe,
but don't laugh. Do you know what it means to have something to believe
in? Don't laugh."

After a while he said, "All right."

After a longer while, I said, "Fixing the world is not what Earthseed is
about."

"The stars. I know." He lay flat on his back, but turned his head to
look at me instead of looking up.

"This world would be a better place if people lived according to
Earthseed," I said. "But then, this world would be better if people
lived according to the teachings of almost any religion."

"That's true. Why do you think they'll live according to the teaching of
yours?"

"A few will. Several thousand? Several hundred thousand? Millions? I
don't know. But when I have a home base, I'll begin the first community.
In fact, I've already begun it."

"Is that what you need me for?" He didn't bother to smile or pretend it
was a joke. It wasn't. I moved over closer to him and sat next to him so
that I could look down into his face.

"I need you to understand me," I said. "I need you to take me the way I
am or go off to your land by yourself."

"You need me to take you and all your friends off the street so you can
start a church." Again, he was altogether serious.

"That or nothing," I said with equal seriousness. He gave me a humorless
smile. "So now we know where we stand."

I smoothed his beard, and saw that he wanted to move away from my hand,
but that he did not move. "Are you all that sure you want God as your
rival?" I asked.

"I don't seem to have much choice, do I?" He covered my caressing hand
with one of his own. "Tell me, do you ever lose your temper and scream
and cry?"

"Sure."

"I can't picture it. In all honesty, I can't."

And that reminded me of something that I hadn't told him, had better
tell him before he found out and felt cheated or decided that I didn't
trust him---which I still didn't, quite. But I didn't want to lose him
to stupidity or cowardice. I didn't want to lose him at all.

"Still want me with you?" I asked.

"Oh, yes," he said. "I intend to marry you once we've settled."

He had managed to surprise me. I stared at him with my mouth open.

"A genuine spur-of-the-moment reaction," he said. I'll have to remember
it. Will you marry me, by the way?"

"Listen to me first."

"No more. Bring your church. Bring your congregation. I doubt they care
any more about the stars than I do, but bring them. I like them, and
there's room for them."

If they would come. My next effort would be to convince them. But this
effort wasn't over yet.

"That isn't all," I said. "Let me tell you one more thing. Then, if you
still want me, I'll marry you anytime you say. I want to. You must know
I want to."

He waited.

"My mother was taking---abusing---a prescription drug when she got
pregnant with me. The drug was Paracetco. As a result, I have
hyperempathy syndrome."

He took that in with no sign of how he felt about it. He sat up and
looked at me---looked at me with great curiosity, as though he hoped to
see some sign of my hyperempathy on my face or body. "You feel other
people's pain?" he asked.

"I share other people's pain and pleasure," I said. "There hasn't been
much pleasure to share lately, except with you."

"Do you share bleeding?"

"No more. I did when I was little."

"But you ... I saw you kill a man."

"Yes." I shook my head, remembering what he had seen. "I had to, or he
would have killed me."

"I know that. It's just that ... I'm surprised you were able to do it."

"I told you, I had to."

He shook his head. "I've read about the syndrome, of course, although
I've never seen a case. I remember thinking that it might not be so bad
a thing if most people had to endure all the pain they caused. Not
doctors or other medical people, of course, but most people."

"Bad idea," I said.

"I'm not sure."

"Take my word for it. Bad, bad idea. Self-defense shouldn't have to be
an agony or a killing or both. I can be crippled by the pain of a
wounded person. I'm a very good shot because I've never felt that I
could afford just to wound someone. Also ..." I stopped, looked past him
for a moment and drew a deep breath, then focused on him again. "The
worst of it is, if you got hurt, I might not be able to help you. I
might be as crippled by your injury---by your pain, I mean---as you
are."

"I suspect you'd find a way." He smiled a little.

"Don't suspect that, Bankole." I stopped and hunted for words that would
make him understand. "I'm not looking for compliments or even
reassurance. I want you to understand: If you broke your leg badly, if
you were shot, if anything serious and disabling happened to you, I
might be disabled, too. You must know how disabling real pain can be."

"Yes. I know a little about you, too. No, don't tell me again that you
aren't fishing for compliments. I know. Let's go back to camp. I've got
some pain medications in my bag. I'll teach you how and when to use them
on me or whoever needs them. If you can just hold on and be yourself
long enough to use them, you can do whatever else may be necessary."

"... okay. So ... do you still want to marry me?" It surprised me how
much I didn't want to ask the question. I knew he still wanted me. Yet
there I was, asking him, almost begging him to say it. I needed to hear
it.

He laughed. Big, full laughter that sounded so real, I couldn't take
offense. "I'll have to remember this," he said. "Do you imagine for one
minute, girl, that I would let you get away?"

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Friday, September 10, 2027

W[E HAD ANOTHER BATTLE]{.small} to try to sleep through before dawn this
morning. It began to the south of us out on or near the highway, and
worked its way first toward, then away from us.

We could hear people shooting, screaming, cursing, running. ... Same old
stuff---tiresome, dangerous, and stupid. The shooting went on for over
an hour, waxing and waning. There was a final barrage that seemed to
involve more guns than ever. Then the noise stopped.

I managed to sleep through some of it. I got over being afraid, even got
over being angry. In the end, I was only tired. I thought, *if the
bastards are going to kill me, I can't stop them by staying awake.* If
that wasn't altogether true, I didn't care. I slept.

And somehow, during or after the battle, in spite of the watch, two
people slipped into our camp and bedded down among us. They slept, too.

We awoke early as usual so that we could start walking while the heat
wasn't too terrible. We've learned to wake up without prompting at the
first light of dawn. Today, four of us sat up in our bags at almost the
same time. I was crawling out of my bag to go off and urinate when I
spotted the extra people---two gray lumps in the dawn light, one large
and one small, lying against each other, asleep on the bare ground. Thin
arms and legs extended like sticks from rags and mounds of clothing.

I glanced around at the others and saw that they were staring where I
was staring---all of them except Jill, who was supposed to be on watch.
We began trusting her to stand night watch last week with a partner.
This was only her second solitary watch. And where was she looking? Away
into the trees. She and I would have to talk.

Harry and Travis were already reacting to the figures on the ground. In
silence, each man was peeling out of his bag in his underwear, and
standing up. More fully clothed, I matched them, move for move, and the
three of us closed in around the two intruders.

The larger of the two awoke all at once, jumped up, darted two or three
steps toward Harry, then stopped. It was a woman. We could see her
better now. She was brown-skinned with a lot of long, straight, unkempt
black hair. Her coloring was as dark as mine, but she was all planes and
angles---a wiry, hawk-faced woman who could have used a few decent meals
and a good scrubbing. She looked like a lot of people we've seen on the
road.

The second intruder awoke, saw Travis standing nearby in his underwear,
and screamed. That got everyone's attention. It was the high, piercing
shriek of a child---a little girl who looked about seven. She was a
tiny, pinched image of the woman---her mother, or her sister perhaps.

The woman ran back to the child and tried to scoop her up. But the child
had folded herself into a tight fetal knot and the woman, trying to lift
her, could not get a grip. She stumbled, fell over, and in an instant
she too had rolled herself into a tight ball. By then everyone had come
to see.

"Harry," I said, and waited until he looked at me. "Would you and Zahra
keep watch---make sure nothing else surprises us."

He nodded. He and Zahra detached from the cluster, separated, and took
up positions on opposite sides of the camp, Harry nearest to the
approach from the highway and Zahra on the approach from the nearest
lesser road. We had buried ourselves as well as we could in a deserted
area that Bankole said must once have been a park, but we didn't kid
ourselves that we were alone. We'd followed I-5 to a small city outside
Sacramento, away from the worst of the sprawl, but there were still
plenty of poor people around---local paupers and refugees like us.

Where had this pair of ragged, terrified, filthy people come from?

"We won't hurt you," I said to them as they lay, still rolled up on the
ground. "Get up. Come on, get up. You've come into our camp unasked. You
can at least talk to us."

We didn't touch them. Bankole seemed to want to, but he stopped when I
grasped his arm. They were already scared to death. A strange man,
reaching out to them, might make them hysterical.

Trembling, the woman unrolled herself and gazed up at us. Now I realized
she looked Asian except for her coloring. She put her head down and
whispered something to the child. After a moment, the two of them stood
up.

"We didn't know this was your place," she whispered. "We'll go away. Let
us go away."

I sighed and looked at the terrified face of the little girl. "You can
go," I said. "Or if you like, you can eat with us."

They both wanted to run away. They were like deer, frozen in terror,
about to bolt. But I'd said the magic word. Two weeks ago, I wouldn't
have said it, but I said today to these two starved-looking people:
"eat."

"Food?" the woman whispered.

"Yes. We'll share a little food with you."

The woman looked at the little girl. I was certain now that they were
mother and daughter. "We can't pay," she said. "We don't have anything."

I could see that. "Just take what we give you and nothing more than we
give you," I said. "That will be pay enough."

"We won't steal. We aren't thieves."

Of course they were thieves. How else could they live. Some stealing and
scavenging, maybe some whoring ... They weren't very good at it or
they'd look better. But for the little kid's sake, I wanted to help them
at least with a meal.

"Wait, then," I said. "We'll put a meal together."

They sat where they were and watched us with hungry, hungry eyes. There
was more hunger in those eyes than we could fill with all our food. I
thought I had probably made a mistake. These people were so desperate,
they were dangerous. It didn't matter at all that they looked harmless.
They were still alive and strong enough to run. They were not harmless.

It was Justin who eased some of the tension in those bottomless, hungry
eyes. Stark naked, he toddled over to the woman and the girl and looked
them over. The little girl only stared back, but after a moment, the
woman began to smile. She said something to Justin, and he smiled. Then
he ran back to Allie who held on to him long enough to dress him. But he
had done his work. The woman was seeing us with different eyes. She
watched Natividad nursing Dominic, then watched Bankole combing his
beard. This seemed funny to her and to the child, and they both giggled.

"You're a hit," I told Bankole.

"I don't see what's so funny about a man combing his beard," he
muttered, and put away his comb.

I dug sweet pears out of my pack, and took one each to the woman and the
girl. I had just bought them two days before, and I had only three left.
Other people got the idea and began sharing what they could spare.
Shelled walnuts, apples, a pomegranate, Valencia oranges, figs. ...
little things.

"Save what you can," Natividad told the woman as she gave her almonds
wrapped in a piece of red cloth. "Wrap things in here and tie the ends
together."

We all shared corn bread made with a little honey and the hard-boiled
eggs we bought and cooked yesterday. We baked the corn bread in the
coals of last night's fire so that we could get away early this morning.
The woman and the girl ate as though the plain, cold food were the best
they had ever tasted, as though they couldn't believe someone had given
it to them. They crouched over it as though they were afraid we might
snatch it back.

"We've got to go," I said at last. "The sun's getting hotter."

The woman looked at me, her strange, sharp face hungry again, but now
not hungry for food.

"Let us go with you," she said, her words tumbling over one another.
"We'll work. We'll get wood, make fire, clean dishes, anything. Take us
with you."

Bankole looked at me. "I assume you saw that coming."

I nodded. The woman was looking from one of us to the other.

"Anything," she whispered---or whimpered. Her eyes were dry and starved,
but tears streamed from the little girl's eyes.

"Give us a moment to decide," I said. I meant, *Go away so my friends
can yell at me in private,* but the woman didn't seem to understand. She
didn't move.

"Wait over there," I said, pointing toward the trees nearest to the
road. "Let us talk. Then we'll tell you."

She didn't want to do it. She hesitated, then stood up, pulled her even
more reluctant daughter up, and trudged off to the trees I had
indicated.

"Oh God," Zahra muttered. "We're going to take them, aren't we?"

"That's what we have to decide," I said.

"What, we feed her, and then we get to tell her to go away and finish
starving?" Zahra made a noise of disgust.

"If she isn't a thief," Bankole said. "And if she doesn't have any other
dangerous habits, we may be able to carry them. That little kid ..."

"Yes," I said. "Bankole, is there room for them at your place?"

"His place?" three others asked. I hadn't had a chance to tell them
about it. And I hadn't had the nerve.

"He has a lot of land up north and over by the coast," I said. "There's
a family house that we can't live in because his sister and her family
are there. But there's room and trees and water. He says ..." I
swallowed, looked at Bankole who was smiling a little. "He says we can
start Earthseed there---build what we can."

"Are there jobs?" Harry asked Bankole.

"My brother-in-law manages with year-round gardens and temporary jobs.
He's raising three kids that way."

"But the jobs do pay money?"

"Yes, they pay. Not well, but they pay. We'd better hold off talking
about this for a while. We're torturing that young woman over there."

"She'll steal," Natividad said. "She says she won't, but she will. You
can look at her and tell."

"She's been beaten," Jill said. "The way they rolled up when we first
spotted them. They're used to being beaten, kicked, knocked around."

"Yeah." Allie looked haunted. "You try to keep from getting hit in the
head, try to protect your eyes and ... your front. She thought we would
beat her. She and the kid both."

Interesting that Allie and Jill should understand so well. What a
terrible father they had. And what had happened to their mother? They
had never talked about her. It was amazing that they had escaped alive
and sane enough to function.

"Should we let her stay?" I asked them.

Both girls nodded. "I think she'll be a pain in the ass for a while,
though," Allie said. "Like Natividad says, she'll steal. She won't be
able to stop herself. We'll have to watch her real good. That little kid
will steal, too. Steal and run like hell."

Zahra grinned. "Reminds me of me at that age. They'll both be pains in
the ass. I vote we try them. If they have manners or if they can learn
manners, we keep them. If they're too stupid to learn, we throw them
out."

I looked at Travis and Harry, standing together. "What do you guys say?"

"I say you're going soft," Harry said. "You would have raised hell if
we'd tried to take in a beggar woman and her child a few weeks ago."

I nodded. "You're right. I would have. And maybe that's the attitude we
should keep. But these two ... I think they might be worth
something---and I don't think they're dangerous. If I'm wrong, we can
always dump them."

"They might not take to being dumped," Travis said. Then he shrugged. "I
don't want to be the one to send that little kid out to be one more
thief-beggar-whore. But think, Lauren. If we let them stay, and it
doesn't work out, it might be damned hard to get rid of them. And if
they turn out to have friends around here---friends that they're
scouting for, we might have to kill them."

Both Harry and Natividad began to protest. Kill a woman and a child? No!
Not possible! Never!

The rest of us let them talk. When they ran down, I said, "It could get
that bad, I suppose, but I don't think it will. That woman wants to
live. Even more, she wants the kid to live. I think she'd put up with a
lot for the kid's sake, and I don't think she'd put the kid in danger by
scouting for a gang. Gangs are more direct out here, anyway. They don't
need scouts."

Silence.

"Shall we try them?" I asked. "Or shall we turn them away now?"

"I'm not against them," Travis said. "Let them stay, for the kid's sake.
But let's go back to having two watchers at once during the night. How
the hell did those two get in here like that, anyway?"

Jill shrank a little. "They could have gotten in anytime last night,"
she said. "Anytime."

"What we don't see can kill us," I said. "Jill, you didn't see them?"

"They could have been there when I took over the watch!"

"You still didn't see them. They could have cut your throat---or your
sister's."

"Well. They didn't."

"The next one might." I leaned toward her. "The world is full of crazy,
dangerous people. We see signs of that every day. If we don't watch out
for ourselves, they will rob us, kill us, and maybe eat us. It's a world
gone to hell, Jill, and we've only got each other to keep it off us."

Sullen silence.

I reached out and took her hand. "Jill."

"It wasn't my fault!" she said. "You can't prove I---"

"Jill!"

She shut up and stared at me.

"Listen, no one is going to beat you up, for heaven sake, but you did
something wrong, something dangerous. You know you did."

"So what do you want her to do?" Allie demanded. "Get on her knees and
say she's sorry?"

"I want her to love her own life and yours enough not to be careless.
That's what I want. That's what you should want, now more than ever.
Jill?"

Jill closed her eyes. "Oh shit!" she said. And then, "All right, all
right! I didn't see them. I really didn't. I'll watch better. No one
else will get by me."

I clasped her hand for a moment longer, then let it go. "Okay. Let's get
out of here. Let's collect that scared woman and her scared little kid
and get out of here."

The two scared people turned out to be the most racially mixed that I
had ever met. Here's their story, put together from the fragments they
told us during the day and tonight. The woman had a Japanese father, a
black mother, and a Mexican husband, all dead. Only she and her daughter
are left. Her name is Emery Tanaka Solis. Her daughter is Tori Solis.
Tori is nine years old, not seven as I had guessed. I suspect she has
rarely had enough to eat in her life. She's tiny, quick, quiet, and
hungry-eyed. She hid bits of food in her filthy rags until we made her a
new dress from one of Bankole's shirts. Then she hid food in that.
Although Tori is nine, her mother is only twenty-three. At thirteen,
Emery married a much older man who promised to take care of her. Her
father was already dead, killed in someone else's gunfight. Her mother
was sick, and dying of tuberculosis. The mother pushed Emery into
marriage to save her from victimization and starvation in the streets.

Up to that point, the situation was dreary, but normal. Emery had three
children over the next three years---a daughter and two sons. She and
her husband did farm work in trade for food, shelter, and hand-me-downs.
Then the farm was sold to a big agribusiness conglomerate, and the
workers fell into new hands. Wages were paid, but in company scrip, not
in cash. Rent was charged for the workers' shacks. Workers had to pay
for food, for clothing---new or used---for everything they needed, and,
of course they could only spend their company notes at the company
store. Wages---surprise!---were never quite enough to pay the bills.
According to new laws that might or might not exist, people were not
permitted to leave an employer to whom they owed money. They were
obligated to work off the debt either as quasi-indentured people or as
convicts. That is, if they refused to work, they could be arrested,
jailed, and in the end, handed over to their employers.

Either way, such debt slaves could be forced to work longer hours for
less pay, could be "disciplined" if they failed to meet their quotas,
could be traded and sold with or without their consent, with or without
their families, to distant employers who had temporary or permanent need
of them. Worse, children could be forced to work off the debt of their
parents if the parents died, became disabled, or escaped.

Emery's husband sickened and died. There was no doctor, no medicine
beyond a few expensive over-the-counter preparations and the herbs that
the workers grew in their tiny gardens. Jorge Francisco Solis died in
fever and pain on the earthen floor of his shack without ever seeing a
doctor. Bankole said it sounded as though he died of peritonitis brought
on by untreated appendicitis. Such a simple thing. But then, there's
nothing more replaceable than unskilled labor.

Emery and her children became responsible for the Solis debt. Accepting
this, Emery worked and endured until one day, without warning, her sons
were taken away. They were one and two years younger than her daughter,
and too young to be without both their parents. Yet they were taken.
Emery was not asked to part with them, nor was she told what would be
done with them. She had terrible suspicions when she recovered from the
drug she had been given to "quiet her down." She cried and demanded the
return of her sons and would not work again until her masters threatened
to take her daughter as well.

She decided then to run away, to take her daughter and brave the roads
with their thieves, rapists, and cannibals. They had nothing for anyone
to steal, and rape wasn't something they could escape by remaining
slaves. As for the cannibals ... well, perhaps they were only
fantasies---lies intended to frighten slaves into accepting their lot.

"There are cannibals," I told her as we ate that night. "We've seen
them. I think, though, that they're scavengers, not killers. They take
advantage of road kills, that kind of thing."

"Scavengers kill," Emery said. "If you get hurt or if you look sick,
they come after you."

I nodded, and she went on with her story. Late one night, she and Tori
slipped out past the armed guards and electrified fences, the sound and
motion detectors and the dogs. Both knew how to be quiet, how to fade
from cover to cover, how to lie still for hours. Both were very fast.
Slaves learned things like that---the ones who lived did. Emery and Tori
must have been very lucky.

Emery had some notion of finding her sons and getting them back, but she
had no idea where they had been taken. They had been driven away in a
truck; she knew that much. But she didn't know even which way the truck
turned when it reached the highway. Her parents had taught her to read
and write, but she had seen no writing about her sons. She had to admit
after a while that all she could do was save her daughter.

Living on wild plants and whatever they could "find" or beg, they
drifted north. That was the way Emery said it: they found things. Well,
if I were in her place, I would have found a few things, too.

A gang fight drove her to us. Gangs are always a special danger in
cities. If you keep to the road while you're in individual gang
territories, you might escape their attentions. We have so far. But the
overgrown park land where we camped last night was, according to Emery,
in dispute. Two gangs shot at each other and called insults and
accusations back and forth. Now and then they stopped to shoot at
passing trucks. During one of these intervals, Emery and Tori who had
camped close to the roadside had slipped away.

"One group was coming closer to us," Emery said. "They would shoot and
run. When they ran, they got closer. We had to get away. We couldn't let
them hear us or see us. We found your clearing, but we didn't see you.
You know how to hide."

That, I suppose was a compliment. We try to disappear into the scenery
when that's possible. Most of the time it isn't. Tonight it isn't. And
tonight we watch two at a time.

Sunday, September 12, 2027

Tori Solis has found us two more companions today: Grayson Mora and his
daughter Doe. Doe was only a year younger than Tori, and the two little
girls, walking along, going the same way, became friends. Today we
turned west on State Highway 20 and were heading back toward U.S. 101.
We spent a lot of time talking about settling on Bankole's land, about
jobs and crops and what we might build there.

Meanwhile, the two little girls, Tori and Doe were making friends and
pulling their parents together. The parents were alike enough to attract
my attention. They were about the same age---which meant that the man
had become a father almost as young as the woman had become a mother.
That wasn't unusual, but it was unusual that he had taken charge of his
child.

He was a tall, thin, black Latino, quiet, protective of his child, yet
tentative, somehow. He liked Emery. I could see that. Yet on some level
he wanted to get away from her---and away from us. When we left the road
to make camp, he would have gone on if his daughter had not begged, then
cried to stay with us. He had his own food so I told him he could camp
near us if he wanted to. Two things hit me as I talked to him.

First, he didn't like us. That was obvious. He didn't like us at all. I
thought he might resent us because we were united and armed. You tend to
resent the people you're afraid of. I told him we kept a watch, and that
if he could put up with that, he was welcome. He shrugged and said in
his soft, cold voice, "Oh, yeah."

He'll stay. His kid wants it and some part of him wants it, but
something's wrong. Something beyond ordinary traveler caution.

The second thing is only my suspicion. I believe Grayson and Doe Mora
were also slaves. Yet Grayson is now a rich pauper. He has a pair of
sleepsacks, food, water, and money. If I'm right, he took them off
someone---or off someone's corpse.

Why do I think he was a slave? That odd tentativeness of his is just too
much like Emery's. And Doe and Tori, though they don't look alike at
all, seem to understand each other like sisters. Little kids can do that
sometimes, without it meaning anything. Just being little kids together
is enough. But I've never seen any kids but these two both show the
tendency to drop to the ground and roll into a fetal knot when
frightened.

Doe did just that when she tripped and fell, and Zahra stepped over to
see whether she was hurt. Doe's body snapped into a trembling ball. Was
that, as Jill and Allie supposed, what people did when they expected to
be beaten or kicked---a posture of protection and submission both at
once?

"Something wrong about that fellow," Bankole said, glancing at Grayson
as we bedded down next to each other. We had eaten and heard more of
Emery's story, and talked a little, but we were tired. I had my writing
to do, and Travis and Jill were on watch. Bankole, who had an early
morning watch with Zahra just wanted to talk. He sat beside me and spoke
into my ear in a voice so low that if I leaned away from him, I lost
words. "Mora's too jumpy," he said. "He flinches if someone walks close
to him."

"I think he's another ex-slave," I said in a voice just as low. "That
might not be his only problem, but it's his most obvious one."

"So you picked up on that, too." He put his arm around me and sighed. "I
agree. Both he and the child."

"And he doesn't love us."

"He doesn't trust us. Why should he? We'll have to watch all four of
them for a while. They're ... odd. They might be stupid enough to try to
grab some of our packs and leave some night. Or it might just be a
matter of little things starting to disappear. The children are more
likely to get caught at it. Yet if the adults stay, it will be for the
children's sake. If we take it easy on the children and protect them, I
think the adults will be loyal to us."

"So we become the crew of a modern underground railroad," I said.
Slavery again---even worse than my father thought, or at least sooner.
He thought it would take a while.

"None of this is new." Bankole made himself comfortable against me. "In
the early 1990s while I was in college, I heard about cases of growers
doing some of this---holding people against their wills and forcing them
to work without pay. Latins in California, blacks and Latins in the
south. ... Now and then, someone would go to jail for it."

"But Emery says there's a new law---that forcing people or their
children to work off debt that they can't help running up is legal."

"Maybe. It's hard to know what to believe. I suppose the politicians may
have passed a law that could be used to support debt slavery. But I've
heard nothing about it. Anyone dirty enough to be a slaver is dirty
enough to tell a pack of lies. You realize that that woman's children
were sold like cattle---and no doubt sold into prostitution."

I nodded. "She knows, too."

"Yes. My God."

"Things are breaking down more and more." I paused. "I'll tell you,
though, if we can convince ex-slaves that they can have freedom with us,
no one will fight harder to keep it. We need better guns, though. And we
need to be so careful. ... It keeps getting more dangerous out here. It
will be especially dangerous with those little girls around."

"Those two know how to be quiet," Bankole said. "They're little rabbits,
fast and silent. That's why they're still alive."

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Friday, September 17, 2027

W[E READ SOME VERSES]{.small} and talked about Earthseed for a while
this morning. It was a calming thing to do---almost like church. We
needed something calming and reassuring. Even the new people joined in,
asking questions, thinking aloud, applying the verses to their
experiences.

God *is* Change, and in the end, God *does* prevail. But we have
something to say about the whens and the whys of that end.

Yeah.

It's been a horrible week.

We've taken both today and yesterday as rest days. We might take
tomorrow as well. I need it whether the others do or not. We're all sore
and sick, in mourning and exhausted---yet triumphant. Odd to be
triumphant. I think it's because most of us are still alive. We are a
harvest of survivors. But then, that's what we've always been.

This is what happened.

At our noon stop on Tuesday, Tori and Doe, the two little girls, went
away from the group to urinate. Emery went with them. She had kind of
taken charge of Doe as well as her own daughter. The night before, she
and Grayson Mora had slipped away from the group and stayed away for
over an hour. Harry and I were on watch, and we saw them go. Now they
were a couple---all over each other, but at arm's length from everyone
else. Strange people.

So Emery took the girls off to pee---not far away. Just across the hill
face and out of sight behind a patch of dead bushes and tall, dry grass.
The rest of us sat eating, drinking, and sweating in what shade we could
get from a copse of oak trees that looked only half dead. The trees had
been robbed of a great number of branches, no doubt by people needing
firewood. I was looking at their many jagged wounds when the screaming
began.

First there were the high, needle thin, needle sharp shrieks of the
little girls, then we heard Emery shouting for help. Then we heard a
man's voice, cursing.

Most of us jumped up without thinking and ran toward the noise. In
midstride, I grabbed Harry and Zahra by the arms to get their attention.
Then I gestured them back to guard our packs and Natividad and Allie who
had stayed with the babies. Harry had the rifle and Zahra had one of the
Berettas, and in that moment, they both resented the hell out of me. No
matter. For the moment, I was just glad to see them go back. They could
cover us if necessary, and keep us from being overwhelmed.

We found Emery fighting with a big bald man who had grabbed Tori. Doe
was already running back to us, screaming. She ran straight into her
father's arms. He swept her up and ran off toward the highway, then he
veered back toward the oaks and our people. There were other bald people
coming up from the highway. Like us, they ran toward the screams. I saw
metal gleaming among them---perhaps only knives. Perhaps guns. Travis
spotted the group, too, and yelled a warning before I could.

I fell back, dropped to one knee, aimed my .45 two-handed, and waited
for a clear shot at Emery's attacker. The man was much taller than
Emery, and his head and shoulders were exposed except where he held Tori
against him. The little girl looked like a doll that he was clutching in
one arm. Emery was the problem. She, small and quick, was darting at the
man, tearing at his face, trying to reach his eyes. He was trying to
protect his eyes and to knock or throw her away from him. With both
hands free, he might have been quick enough to bat her aside, but he
wouldn't let go of the struggling Tori, and Emery wouldn't be beaten
off.

For an instant, he did knock Emery back from him. In that brief window
of time, my own ears ringing from his blow, I shot him.

I knew at once that I'd hit him. He didn't fall, but I felt his pain,
and I wasn't good for anything else for a while. Then he toppled, and I
collapsed with him. But I could still see and hear, and I still had the
gun.

I heard shouting. The bald gang from the highway was almost on us---six,
seven, eight people. I couldn't do anything while I was dealing with the
pain, but I saw them. Instants later when the man I had shot lost
consciousness or died, I was free---and needed.

Bankole had our only other gun away from camp.

I got up before I should have, almost fell down again, then shot a
second attacker off Travis who was carrying Emery.

I went down again, but didn't lose consciousness. I saw Bankole grab
Tori and all but throw her to Jill. Jill caught her, turned, and ran
back toward camp with her.

Bankole reached me, and I was able to get up and help him cover our
retreat.

We had only the scarred trees to retreat to, but they had thick,
solid-looking trunks. An attacker fired several bullets into them as we
reached them.

It took me several seconds to understand that someone was shooting at
us. Once I did, I dropped behind the trees with the others and looked
for the opposing gun.

Our rifle thundered behind me before I could spot anything. Harry, on
the job. He fired twice more. I fired twice myself, barely aiming,
barely in control. I believe Bankole fired. Then I was lost, no more
good for anything. I died with someone. The shooting stopped.

I died with someone else. Someone laid hands on me and I came within a
fingers twitch of squeezing the trigger once more.

Bankole.

"You stupid asshole!" I whimpered. "I almost killed you."

"You're bleeding," he said.

I was surprised. I tried to remember whether I'd been shot. Maybe I had
just come down on a sharp piece of wood. I had no sense of my own body.
I hurt, but I couldn't have said where---or even whether the pain was
mine or someone else's. The pain was intense, yet defuse somehow. I felt
... disembodied.

"Is everyone else all right?" I asked.

"Be still," he said.

*"Is it over, Bankole?"*

"Yes. The survivors have run away."

"Take my gun, then, and give it to Natividad---in case they decide to
come back."

I think I felt him take the gun from my hand. I heard muffled talk that
I didn't quite understand. That was when I realized I was losing
consciousness. All right then. At least I had held on long enough to do
some good.

Jill Gilchrist is dead.

She was shot in the back as she ran toward the trees carrying Tori.
Bankole didn't tell me, didn't want me to know before I had to because,
as it turned out, I was wounded myself. I was lucky. My wound was minor.
It hurt, but other than that, it didn't matter much. Jill was unlucky. I
found out about her death when I came to and heard Allie's hoarse
screaming grief.

Jill had gotten Tori back to the trees, put her down, then, without a
sound, folded to the ground as though taking cover. Emery had grabbed
Tori and huddled, crying with her in terror and relief. Everyone else
had been busy, first taking cover, then firing or directing fire. Travis
was the first to see the blood pooling around Jill. He shouted for
Bankole, then turned Jill onto her back and saw blood welling from what
turned out to be an exit wound in her chest. Bankole says she died
before he reached her. No last words, no last sight of her sister, not
even the assurance that she had saved the little girl. She had. Tori was
bruised, but fine. Everyone was fine except Jill.

My own wound, to be honest, was a big scratch. A bullet had plowed a
furrow straight through the flesh of my left side, leaving little
damage, a lot of blood, a couple of holes in my shirt, and a lot of
pain. The wound throbbed worse than a burn, but it wasn't disabling.

"Cowboy wound," Harry said when he and Zahra came to look me over. They
looked dirty and miserable, but Harry tried to be upbeat for me. They
had just helped to bury Jill. The group had, with hands, sticks, and our
hatchet, dug a shallow grave for her while I was unconscious. They put
her among the trees' roots, covered her, and rolled big rocks atop her
grave. The trees were to have her, but the dogs and the cannibals were
not.

The group had decided to bed down for the night where we were, even
though our oak copse should have been rejected as an overnight camp
because it was too close to the highway.

"You're a goddamn fool and too big to carry" Zahra told me. "So just
rest there and let Bankole take care of you. Not that anyone could stop
him."

"You've just got a cowboy wound," Harry repeated. "In that book I
bought, people are always getting shot in the side or the arm or the
shoulder, and it's nothing---although Bankole says a good percentage of
them would have died of tetanus or some other infection."

"Thanks for the encouragement," I said.

Zahra gave him a look, then patted my arm. "Don't worry," she said. "No
germ will get past that old man. He's mad as hell at you for getting
yourself shot. Says if you had any sense, you would have stayed back
here with the babies."

"What?"

"Hey, he's old," Harry said. "What do you expect."

I sighed. "How's Allie?"

"Crying." He shook his head. "She won't let anyone near her except
Justin. Even he keeps trying to comfort her. It upsets him that she's
crying."

"Emery and Tori are kind of beaten up, too," Zahra said. "They're the
other reason we're not moving." She paused. "Hey, Lauren, you ever
notice anything funny about those two---Emery and Tori, I mean? And
about that guy Mora, too."

Something clicked into place for me, and I sighed again. "They're
sharers, aren't they?"

"Yes, all of them---both adults and both kids. You knew?"

"Not until now. I did notice something odd: that tentativeness and
touchiness---not wanting to be touched, I mean. And they were all
slaves. My brother Marcus once said what good slaves sharers would
make."

"That Mora guy wants to leave," Harry said.

"So let him go," I answered. "He tried to run out on us just before the
shooting."

"He came back. He even helped dig Jill's grave. I mean he wants us all
to leave. He says that gang we beat will come back when it's dark."

"He's sure?"

"Yeah. He's going crazy, wanting to get his kid out of here."

"Can Emery and Tori make it?"

"I'll carry Tori," a new voice said. "Emery can make it." Grayson Mora,
of course. Last seen abandoning ship.

I got up slowly. My side hurt. Bankole had cleaned and bandaged the
wound while I was unconscious, and that was a piece of luck. Now,
though, I felt half-conscious, half-detached from my body. I felt
everything except pain as though through a thick layer of cotton. Only
the pain was sharp and real. I was almost grateful for it.

"I can walk," I said after trying a few steps. "But I feel like I'm
walking on stilts. I don't know if I can keep the usual pace."

Grayson Mora stepped close to me. He glanced at Harry as though he
wished Harry would go away. Harry just stared back at him.

"How many times did you die?" Mora asked me.

"Three at least," I answered, as though this were a sane conversation.
"Maybe four. I never did it like that before---over and over. Insane.
But you look well enough."

His expression hardened as though I'd slapped him. Of course, I had
insulted him. I'd said, *Where were you, man and fellow sharer, while
your woman and your group were in danger.* Funny. There I was, speaking
a language I hadn't realized I knew.

"I had to get Doe out of danger," he said. "I had no gun, anyway."

"Can you shoot?"

He hesitated. "Never shot before," he admitted, dropping his voice to a
mumble. Again I'd shamed him---this time without meaning to.

"When we teach you to shoot, will you, to protect the group?"

"Yeah!" Though at that moment, I think he would have preferred to shoot
me.

"It hurts like hell," I warned.

He shrugged. "Most things do."

I looked into his thin, angry face. Were all slaves so thin---underfed,
overworked, and taught that most things hurt? "Are you from this area?"

"Born in Sacramento."

"Then we need all the information you can give us. Even without a gun,
we need you to help us survive here."

"My information is to get out of here before those things up the hill
throw paint on themselves and start shooting people and setting fires."

"Oh, shit," I said. "So that's what they are."

"What'd you think they were?"

"I didn't have a chance to think about them. It wouldn't have mattered
anyway. Harry, did you guys strip the dead?"

"Yeah." He gave me a thin smile. "We got another gun---a .38. I put some
stuff in your pack from the ones you killed."

"Thank you. I don't know that I can carry my pack yet. Maybe Bankole---"

"He's already got it on his cart. Let's go."

We headed out toward the road.

"Is that how you do it?" Grayson Mora asked, walking next to me.
"Whoever kills takes?"

"Yes, but we don't kill unless someone threatens us," I said. "We don't
hunt people. We don't eat human flesh. We fight together against
enemies. If one of us is in need, the rest help out. And we don't steal
from one another, *ever."*

"Emery said that. I didn't believe her at first."

"Will you live as we do?"

"... yeah. I guess so."

I hesitated. "So what else is wrong? I can see that you don't trust us,
even now."

He walked closer to me, but did not touch me. "Where'd that white man
come from?" he demanded.

"I've known him all my life," I said. "He and I and the others have kept
one another alive for a long time, now."

"But ... him and those others, they don't feel anything. You're the only
one who feels."

"We call it sharing. I'm the only one."

"But they. ... You ..."

"We help each other. A group is strong. One or two people are easier to
rob and kill."

"Yeah." He looked around at the others. There was no great trust or
liking in his expression, but he looked more relaxed, more satisfied. He
looked as though he had solved a troubling puzzle.

Testing him, I let myself stumble. It was easy. I still had little
feeling in my feet and legs.

Mora stepped aside. He didn't touch me or offer help. Sweet guy.

I left Mora, went over to Allie, and walked with her for a while. Her
grief and resentment were like a wall against me---against everyone, I
suppose, but I was the one bothering her at the moment. And I was alive
and her sister was dead, and her sister was the only family she had
left, and why didn't I just get the hell out of her face?

She never said anything. She just pretended I wasn't there. She pushed
Justin along in his carriage and wiped tears from her stony face now and
then with a swift, whiplike motion. She was hurting herself, doing that.
She was rubbing her face too hard, too fast, rubbing it raw. She was
hurting me, too, and I didn't need any more pain. I stayed with her,
though, until her defenses began to crumble under a new wave of
crippling grief. She stopped hurting herself and just let the tears run
down her face, let them fall to her chest or to the broken blacktop. She
seemed to sag under a sudden weight.

I hugged her then. I put my hands on her shoulders and stopped her
half-blind plodding. When she swung around to face me, hostile and
hurting, I hugged her. She could have broken free. I was feeling far
from strong just then, but after a first angry pulling away, she hung on
to me and moaned. I've never heard anyone moan like that. She cried and
moaned there at the roadside, and the others stopped and waited for us.
No one spoke. Justin began to whimper and Natividad came back to comfort
him. The wordless message was the same for both child and woman: *In
spite of your loss and pain, you aren't alone. You still have people who
care about you and want you to be all right. You still have family.*

After a while, Allie and I let each other go. She isn't a chatty woman,
especially not in her pain. She took Justin from Natividad, smoothed his
hair, and held him. When we began walking again, she carried him for a
while, and I pushed the carriage. We walked together, and there didn't
seem to be any need to say anything.

On the road, there was a fair amount of foot traffic in both directions.
Still, I worried that a big group like ours would be noticeable and
locatable, no matter what. I worried because I didn't understand the
ways of our attackers.

Sometime later when Allie put Justin back into the carriage and took the
carriage from me, I moved to walk with Bankole and Emery. Emery was the
one who explained things to me, and she was the one who spotted the
smoke from the first fire---no doubt because she was looking for it. We
couldn't tell for sure, but the fire looked as though it might have
begun back as far as where we had stopped at the oak copse.

"They'll burn everything," Emery whispered to Bankole and me. "They
won't stop until they've used up all the 'ro they have. All night,
they'll be burning things. Things and people."

'Ro, pyro, pyromania. That damned fire drug again.

"Will they follow us?" I asked.

She shrugged. "There are a lot of us, and you killed some of them. I
think they'll take their revenge on other, weaker travelers." Another
shrug. "To them we're all the same. A traveler is a traveler."

"So unless we get caught in one of their fires ..."

"We'll be okay, yeah. They hate everybody who isn't them. They would
have sold my Tori to get some more 'ro."

I looked at her bruised, swollen face. Bankole had given her something
for her pain. I was grateful for that, and half-angry at him for
refusing to give me anything. He didn't understand my numbness and
grogginess back at the copse, and it disturbed him. Well at least that
had faded away. Let him die three or four times and see how he feels.
No, I'm glad he'll never know how it feels. It makes no sense. That
brief, endless agony, over and over. It makes no sense at all. I keep
catching myself wondering how it is that I'm still alive.

"Emery?" I said, keeping my voice low.

She looked at me.

"You know I'm a sharer."

She nodded, then glanced sidelong at Bankole.

"He knows," I assured her. "But ... look, you and Grayson are the first
sharers I've known who had children." There was no reason to tell her
she and Grayson and their children were the first sharers I'd known
period. "I hope to have kids myself someday, so I need to know ... do
they always inherit the sharing?"

"One of my boys didn't have it," she said. "Some
feelers---sharers---can't have any kids. I don't know why. And I knew
some who had two or three kids who didn't have it at all. Bosses,
though, they like you to have it."

"I'll bet they do."

"Sometimes," she continued, "sometimes they pay more for people who have
it. Especially kids."

Her kids. Yet they had taken a boy who wasn't a sharer and left a girl
who was. How long would it have been before they came back for the girl?
Perhaps they had a lucrative offer for the boys as a pair, so they sold
them first.

"My god," Bankole said. "This country has slipped back two hundred
years."

"Things were better when I was little," Emery said. "My mother always
said they would get better again. Good times would come back. She said
they always did. My father would shake his head and not say anything."
She looked around to see where Tori was and spotted her on Grayson
Mora's shoulders. Then she caught sight of something else, and she
gasped.

We followed her gaze and saw fire creeping over the hills behind
us---far behind us, but not far enough. This was some new fire, whipping
along in the dry evening breeze. Either the people who attacked us had
followed us, setting fires, or someone was imitating them, echoing them.

We went on, moving faster, trying to see where we could go to be safe.
On either side of the highway, there was dry grass, there were trees,
living and dead. So far, the fire was only on the north side.

We kept to the south side, hoping it would be safe. There was a lake
ahead, according to my map of the area---Clear Lake, it was called. The
map showed it to be large, and the highway followed its northern shore
for a few miles. We would reach it soon. How soon?

I calculated as we walked. Tomorrow. We should be able to camp near it
tomorrow evening. Not soon enough.

I could smell the smoke now. Did that mean the wind was blowing the fire
toward us?

Other people began hurrying and keeping to the south side of the road
and heading west. No one went east now. There were no trucks yet, but it
was getting late. They would be barreling through soon. And we should be
camping for the night soon. Did we dare?

The south side still seemed free of fire behind us, but on the north
side the fire crawled after us, coming no closer, but refusing to be
left behind.

We went on for a while, all of us looking back often, all of us tired,
some of us hurting. I called a halt and gestured us off the road to the
south at a place where there was room to sit and rest.

"We can't stay here," Mora said. "The fire could jump the road any
time."

"We can rest here for a few moments," I said. "We can see the fire, and
it will tell us when we'd better start walking again."

"We'd better start now!" Mora said. "If that fire gets going good, it
will move faster than we can run! Best to keep well ahead of it!"

"Best to have the strength to keep ahead of it," I said, and I took a
water bottle from my pack and drank. We were within sight of the road
and we had made it a rule not to eat or drink in such exposed places,
but today that rule had to be suspended. To go into the hills away from
the road might mean being cut off from the road by fire. We couldn't
know when or where a windblown piece of burning debris might land.

Others followed my example and drank and ate a little dried fruit, meat,
and bread. Bankole and I shared with Emery and Tori. Mora seemed to want
to leave in spite of us, but his daughter Doe was sitting half asleep on
the ground against Zahra. He stooped next to her and made her drink a
little water and eat some fruit.

"We might have to keep moving all night," Allie said, her voice almost
too soft to hear. "This might be the only rest we get." And to Travis,
"You'd better put Dominic into the carriage with Justin when he's
finished eating."

Travis nodded. He'd carried Dominic this far. Now he tucked him in with
Justin. "I'll push the carriage for a while," he said.

Bankole looked at my wound, rebandaged it, and this time gave me
something for the pain. He buried the bloody bandages he had removed,
digging a shallow hole with a flat rock.

Emery, with Tori gone to sleep against her, looked to see what Bankole
was doing with me, then jumped and looked away, her hand going to her
own side.

"I didn't know you were hurt so much," she whispered.

"I'm not," I said, and made myself smile. "It looks nastier than it is
with all the blood, but it isn't bad. I'm damned lucky compared to Jill.
And it doesn't stop me from walking."

"You didn't give me any pain when we were walking," she said.

I nodded, glad to know I could fake her out. "It's ugly," I said, "but
not too painful."

She settled down as though she felt better. No doubt she did. If I
moaned and groaned, I'd have all four of them moaning and groaning. The
kids might even bleed along with me. I would have to be careful and keep
lying at least as long as the fire was a threat---or as long as I could.

The truth was, those blood-saturated bandages scared the hell out of me,
and the wound hurt worse than ever. But I knew I had to keep going or
burn. After a few minutes, Bankole's pills began to take the edge off my
pain, and that made the whole world easier to endure.

We had about an hour's rest before the fire made us too nervous to stay
where we were. Then we got up and walked. By then, at some point behind
us, the fire had already jumped the road. Now, neither the north nor the
south side looked safe. Until it was dark, all we could see in the hills
behind us was smoke. It was a terrifying, looming, moving wall.

Later, after dark, we could see the fire eating its way toward us. There
were dogs running along the road with us, but they paid no attention to
us. Cats and deer ran past us, and a skunk scuttled by. It was live and
let live. Neither humans nor animals were foolish enough to waste time
attacking one another. Behind us and to the north, the fire began to
roar.

We put Tori in the carriage and Justin and Dominic between her legs. The
babies never even woke up while we were moving them. Tori herself was
more than half asleep. I worried that the carriage might break down with
the extra weight, but it held. Travis, Harry, and Allie traded off
pushing it.

Doe, we put atop the load on Bankole's cart. She couldn't have been
comfortable there, but she didn't complain. She was more awake than
Tori, and she had been walking on her own most of the time since our
encounter with the would-be kidnappers. She was a strong little
kid---her father's daughter.

Grayson Mora helped push Bankole's cart. In fact, once Doe was loaded
aboard, Mora pushed the cart most of the time. The man wasn't likeable,
but in his love for his daughter, he was admirable.

At some point in the endless night, more smoke and ash than ever began
to swirl around us, and I caught myself thinking that we might not make
it. Without stopping, we wet shirts, scarves, whatever we had, and tied
them around our noses and mouths.

The fire roared and thundered its way past us on the north, singeing our
hair and clothing, making breathing a terrible effort. The babies woke
up and screamed in fear and pain, then choked and almost brought me
down. Tori, crying herself with their pain and her own, held on to them
and would not let them struggle out of the carriage.

I thought we would die. I believed there was no way for us to survive
this sea of fire, hot wind, smoke, and ash. I saw
people---strangers---fall, and we left them lying on the highway,
waiting to burn. I stopped looking back. In the roar of the fire, I
could not hear whether they screamed. I could see the babies before
Natividad threw wet rags over them. I knew they were screaming. Then I
couldn't see them, and it was a blessing.

We began to run out of water.

There was nothing to do except keep going or burn. The terrible,
deafening noise of the fire increased, then lessened, and again,
increased, then lessened. It seemed that the fire went north away from
the road, then whipped back down toward us.

It teased like a living, malevolent thing, intent on causing pain and
terror. It drove us before it like dogs chasing a rabbit. Yet it didn't
eat us. It could have, but it didn't.

In the end, the worst of it roared off to the northwest. Firestorm,
Bankole called it later. Yes. Like a tornado of fire, roaring around,
just missing us, playing with us, then letting us live.

We could not rest. There was still fire. Little fires that could grow
into big ones, smoke, blinding and choking smoke. ... No rest.

But we could slow down. We could emerge from the worst of the smoke and
ash, and escape the lash of hot winds. We could pause by the side of the
road for a moment, and gag in peace. There was a lot of gagging.
Coughing and gagging and crying muddy tracks onto our faces. It was
incredible. We were going to survive. We were still alive and
together---scorched and miserable, in great need of water, but alive. We
were going to make it.

Later, when we dared, we went off the road, unloaded my pack from
Bankole's cart, and dug out his extra water bottle. He dug it out. He'd
told us he had it when he could have kept it for himself.

"We'll reach Clear Lake sometime tomorrow," I said. "Early tomorrow, I
think. I don't know how far we've come or where we are now, so I can
only guess that we'll get there early. But it is there waiting for us
tomorrow."

People grunted or coughed and downed swallows from Bankole's extra
bottle. The kids had to be prevented from guzzling too much water. As it
was, Dominic choked and began to cry again.

We camped where we were, within sight of the road. Two of us had to stay
awake on watch. I volunteered for first watch because I was in too much
pain to sleep. I got my gun back from Natividad, checked to see that she
had reloaded it---she had---and looked around for a partner.

"I'll watch with you," Grayson Mora said.

That surprised me. I would have preferred someone who knew how to use a
gun---someone I would trust with a gun.

"I'm not going to be able to sleep until you do," he said. "It's that
simple. So let's both put our pain to good use."

I looked at Emery and the two girls to see whether they'd heard, but
they seemed to be already asleep. "All right," I said. "We've got to
watch for strangers and fire. Give me a yell if you see anything
unusual."

"Give me a gun," he said. "If anybody comes close, I can at least use it
to scare them."

In the dark, sure. "No gun," I said. "Not yet. You don't know enough
yet."

He stared at me for several seconds, then went over to Bankole. He
turned his back to me as he spoke to Bankole. "Look, you know I need a
gun to do any guarding in a place like this. She doesn't know how it is.
She thinks she does, but she doesn't."

Bankole shrugged. "If you can't do it, man, go to sleep. One of us will
take the watch with her."

"Shit." Mora made the word long and nasty. "Shiiit. First time I saw
her, I knew she was a man. Just didn't know she was the only man here."

Absolute silence.

Doe Mora saved the situation to the degree that it could be saved. At
that moment she stepped up behind her father and tapped him on the back.
He spun around, more than ready to fight, spun with such speed and fury
that the little girl squealed and jumped back.

"What the hell are you doing up!" he shouted. "What do you want!"

Frightened, the little girl just stared at him. After a moment, she
extended her hand, offering a pomegranate. "Zahra said we could have
this," she whispered. "Would you cut it?"

Good thinking, Zahra! I didn't turn to look at her, but I was aware of
her watching. By now, everyone still awake was watching.

"Everyone's tired and everyone's hurting," I told him. "Everyone, not
just you. But we've managed to keep ourselves alive by working together
and by not doing or saying stupid things."

"And if that's not good enough for you," Bankole added, in a voice low
and ugly with anger, "tomorrow you can go out and find yourself a
different kind of group to travel with---a group too goddamn macho to
waste its time saving your child's life twice in one day."

There must be something worthwhile in Mora. He didn't say anything. He
took out his knife and cut the pomegranate into quarters for Doe, then
kept half of it because she insisted that he was supposed to have half.
They sat together and ate the juicy, seedy, red fruit, then Mora tucked
Doe in again and found himself a perch where, gunless, he began his
first watch.

He said nothing more about guns, and he never apologized. Of course he
didn't leave us. Where would he go? He was a runaway slave. We were the
best thing he'd found so far---the best he was going to find as long as
he had Doe with him.

We didn't reach Clear Lake the next morning. To tell the truth it was
already the next morning when we went to sleep. We were too tired and
sore to get up at dawn---which came early in the second watch. Only the
need for water made us move out when we did---at a hot, smoky 11
[A.M.]{.small}

We found the corpse of a young woman when we got back to the road. There
wasn't a mark on her, but she was dead.

"I want her clothes," Emery whispered. She was near me or I wouldn't
have heard her. The dead woman was about her size, and dressed in a
cotton shirt and pants that looked almost new. They were dirty, but far
less so than Emery's clothes.

"Strip her, then," I said. "I'd help you, but I'm not bending too well
this morning."

"I'll give her a hand," Allie whispered. Justin was asleep in his
carriage with Dominic, so she was free to help with the ordinary,
unspeakable things that we did now to live.

The dead woman had not even soiled herself in her dying. That made the
job less disgusting than it could have been. Rigor mortis had set in,
however, and stripping her was a job for two.

There was no one but us on this stretch of road, so Emery and Allie had
all the time they needed. We had seen no other walkers yet this morning.

Emery and Allie took every scrap of clothing, including underwear,
socks, and boots, though Emery thought the boots would be too big for
her. No matter. If no one could wear them, she could sell them.

In fact, it was the boots that yielded Emery the first cash she had ever
owned. On the farm where she had been a slave, she had been paid only in
company scrip, worthless except on the farm, and almost worthless there.

Stitched into the tongue of each of the dead woman's boots were five,
folded one hundred-dollar bills---a thousand dollars in all. We had to
tell her how little that was. If she were careful, and shopped only at
the cheapest stores, and ate no meat, wheat, or dairy products, it might
feed her for two weeks. It might feed both her and Tori for a week and a
half. Still, it seemed riches to Emery.

Late that day, when we reached Clear Lake---much smaller than I had
expected---we came across a tiny, expensive store, being run from the
back of an old truck near a cluster of half-burned, collapsed cabins. It
sold fruit, vegetables, nuts, and smoked fish. We all had to buy a few
things, but Emery squandered too much money on pears and walnuts for
everyone. She delighted in passing these around, in being able to give
us something for a change. She's all right. We'll have to teach her
about shopping and the value of money, but she's worth something, Emery
is. And she's decided she's one of us.

Sunday, September 26, 2027

Somehow, we've reached our new home---Bankole's land in the coastal
hills of Humboldt County. The highway---U.S. 101---is to the east and
north of us, and Cape Mendocino and the sea are to the west. A few miles
south are state parks filled with huge redwood trees and hordes of
squatters. The land surrounding us, however, is as empty and wild as any
I've seen. It's covered with dry brush, trees, and tree stumps, all far
removed from any city, and a long, hilly walk from the little towns that
line the highway. There's farming around here, and logging, and just
plain isolated living. According to Bankole, it's best to mind your own
business and not pay too much attention to how people on neighboring
plots of land earn a living. If they hijack trucks on 101, grow
marijuana, distill whisky, or brew up more complicated illegal
substances. ... Well, live and let live.

Bankole guided us along a narrow blacktopped road that soon became a
narrow dirt road. We saw a few cultivated fields, some scars left by
past fires or logging, and a lot of land that seemed unused. The road
all but vanished before we came to the end of it. Good for isolation.
Bad for getting things in or out. Bad for traveling back and forth to
get work. Bankole had said his brother-in-law had to spend a lot of time
in various towns, away from his family. That was easier to understand
now. There's no possibility here of coming home every day or two. So
what did you have to do to save cash? Sleep in doorways or parks in
town? Maybe it was worth the inconvenience to do just that if you could
keep your family together and safe---far from the desperate, the crazy,
and the vicious.

Or that's what I thought until we reached the hillside where Bankole's
sister's house and outbuildings were supposed to be.

There was no house. There were no buildings. There was almost nothing: A
broad black smear on the hillside; a few charred planks sticking up from
the rubble, some leaning against others; and a tall brick chimney,
standing black and solitary like a tombstone in a picture of an
old-style graveyard. A tombstone amid the bones and ashes.

EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

Friday, October 1, 2027

W[E'VE BEEN ARGUING ALL]{.small} week about whether or not we should
stay here with the bones and ashes.

We've found five skulls---three in what was left of the house and two
outside. There were other scattered bones, but not one complete
skeleton. Dogs have been at the bones---dogs and cannibals, perhaps. The
fire happened long enough ago for weeds to begin to grow in the rubble.
Two months ago? Three? Some of the far-flung neighbors might know. Some
of the far-flung neighbors might have set the fire.

There was no way to be certain, but I assumed that the bones belonged to
Bankole's sister and her family. I think Bankole assumed that, too, but
he couldn't bring himself to just bury the bones and write off his
sister. The day after we got here, he and Harry hiked back to Glory, the
nearest small town that we had passed through, to talk to the local
cops. They were, or they professed to be, sheriff's deputies. I wonder
what you have to do to become a cop. I wonder what a badge is, other
than a license to steal. What did it used to be to make people Bankole's
age want to trust it. I know what the old books say, but still, I
wonder.

The deputies all but ignored Bankole's story and his questions. They
wrote nothing down, claimed to know nothing. They treated Bankole as
though they doubted that he even had a sister, or that he was who he
said he was. So many stolen IDs these days. They searched him and took
the cash he was carrying. Fees for police services, they said. He had
been careful to carry only what he thought would be enough to keep them
sweet-tempered, but not enough to make them suspicious or more greedy
than they already were. The rest---a sizeable packet---he left with me.
He trusted me enough to do that. His gun he left with Harry who had gone
shopping.

Jail for Bankole could have meant being sold into a period of hard,
unpaid labor---slavery. Perhaps if he had been younger, the deputies
might have taken his money and arrested him anyway on some trumped-up
charge. I had begged him not to go, not to trust *any* police or
government official. It seemed to me such people were no better than
gangs with their robbing and slaving.

Bankole agreed with me, yet he insisted on going.

"She was my little sister," he said. "I have to try, at least, to find
out what happened to her. I need to know who did this. Most of all, I
need to know whether any of her children could have survived. One or
more of those five skulls could have belonged to the arsonists." He
stared at the collection of bones. "I have to risk going to the
sheriff's office," he continued. "But you don't. I don't want you with
me. I don't want them getting any ideas about you, maybe finding out by
accident that you're a sharer. I don't want my sister's death to cost
you your life or your freedom."

We fought about it. I was afraid for him; he was afraid for me, and we
were both angrier than we had ever been at each other. I was terrified
that he would be killed or arrested, and we'd never find out what
happened to him. No one should travel alone in this world.

"Look," he said at last, "you can do some good here with the group.
You'll have one of the four guns left here, and you know how to survive.
You're needed here. If the cops decide they want me, you won't be able
to do a thing. Worse, if they decide they want you, there'll be nothing
I can do except take revenge, and be killed for it."

That slowed me down---the thought that I might cause his death instead
of backing him up. I didn't quite believe it, but it slowed me down.
Harry stepped in then and said he would go. He wanted to anyway. He
could buy some things for the group, and he wanted to look for a job. He
wanted to earn some money.

"I'll do what I can," he told me just before they left. "He's not a bad
old guy. I'll bring him back to you."

They brought each other back, Bankole a few thousand dollars poorer, and
Harry still jobless---though they did bring back supplies and a few hand
tools. Bankole knew no more than he had when he left about his sister
and her family, but the cops had said they would come out to investigate
the fire and the bones.

We worried that sooner or later, they might show up. We're still keeping
a lookout for them, and we've hidden---buried---most of our valuables.
We want to bury the bones, but we don't dare. It's bothering Bankole.
Bothering him a lot. I've suggested we hold a funeral and go ahead and
bury the bones. The hell with the cops. But he says no. Best to give
them as little provocation as possible. If they came, they would do
enough harm with their stealing. Best not to give them reason to do
more.

There's a well with an old-fashioned hand pump under the rubble of an
outbuilding. It still works. The solar-powered electric pump near the
house does not. We couldn't stay here long without a dependable water
source. With the well, though, it's hard to leave---hard to walk away
from possible sanctuary---in spite of arsonists and cops.

Bankole owns this land, free and clear. There's a huge, half ruined
garden plus citrus trees full of unripe fruit. We've already been
pulling carrots and digging potatoes here. There are plenty of other
fruit and nut trees plus wild pines, redwoods, and Douglas firs. None of
these last were very big. This area was logged sometime before Bankole
bought it. Bankole says it was clear-cut back in the 1980s or 1990s, but
we can make use of the trees that have grown since then, and we can
plant more. We can build a shelter, put in a winter garden from the seed
I've been carrying and collecting since we left home. Granted, a lot of
it is old seed, I hadn't renewed it as often as I should have while I
was at home. Strange that I hadn't. Things kept getting worse and worse
at home, yet I had paid less and less attention to the pack that was
supposed to save my life when the mob came. There was so much else to
worry about---and I think I was into my own brand of denial, as bad in
its way as Cory's or Joanne's mother's. But all that feels like ancient
history. Now was what we had to worry about. What were we going to do
now?

"I don't think we can make it here," Harry said earlier this evening as
we sat around the campfire. There should be something cheerful about
sitting around a campfire with friends and a full stomach. We even had
meat tonight, fresh meat. Bankole took the rifle and went off by himself
for a while. When he came back, he brought three rabbits which Zahra and
I skinned, cleaned, and roasted. We also roasted sweet potatoes that we
had dug out of the garden. We should have been content. Yet all we were
doing was rehashing what had become an old argument over the past few
days. Perhaps it was the bones and ashes just over the rise that were
bothering us. We had camped out of sight of the burned area in the hope
of recovering a little peace of mind, but it hadn't helped. I was
thinking that we should figure out a way to capture a few wild rabbits
alive and breed them for a sure meat supply. Was that possible? Why not,
if we stay here? And we should stay.

"Nothing we find farther north will be any better or any safer than
this," I said. "It will be hard to live here, but if we work together,
and if we're careful, it should be possible. We can build a community
here."

"Oh, god, there she goes with her Earthseed shit again," Allie said. But
she smiled a little as she said it. That was good. She hadn't smiled
much lately.

"We can build a community here," I repeated. "It's dangerous, sure, but,
hell, it's dangerous everywhere, and the more people there are packed
together in cities, the more danger there is. This is a ridiculous place
to build a community. It's isolated, miles from everywhere with no
decent road leading here, but for us, for now, it's perfect."

"Except that someone burned this place down last time," Grayson Mora
said. "Anything we build out here by itself is a target."

"Anything we build *anywhere* is a target," Zahra argued. "But the
people out here before ... I'm sorry, Bankole, I gotta say this: They
couldn't have kept a good watch---a man and a woman and three kids. They
would have worked hard all day, then slept all night. It would have been
too hard on just two grown people to try to sit up and watch for half
the night each."

"They didn't keep a night watch," Bankole said. "We'll have to keep one,
though. And we could use a couple of dogs. If we could get them as
puppies and train them to guard---"

"Give meat to dogs?" Mora demanded, outraged.

"Not soon." Bankole shrugged. "Not until we have enough for ourselves.
But if we can get dogs, they'll help us keep the rest of our goods."

"I wouldn't give a dog nothing but a bullet or a rock," Mora said. "I
saw dogs eat a woman once."

"There are no jobs in that town Bankole and I went to," Harry said.
"There was nothing. Not even work for room and board. I asked all over
town. No one even knew of anything."

I frowned. "The towns around here are all close to the highway," I said.
"They must get a lot of people passing through, looking for a place to
settle---or maybe a place to rob, rape, kill. The locals wouldn't
welcome new people. They wouldn't trust anyone they didn't know."

Harry looked from me to Bankole.

"She's right," Bankole said. "My brother-in-law had a hard time before
people began to get used to him, and he moved up here before things got
so bad. He knew plumbing, carpentry, electrical work, and motor vehicle
mechanics. Of course, it didn't help that he was black. Being white
might help you win people over faster than he did. I think, though, that
any serious money we make here will come from the land. Food is gold
these days, and we can grow food here. We have guns to protect
ourselves, so we can sell our crops in nearby towns or on the highway."

"If we survive long enough to grow anything to sell," Mora muttered. "If
there's enough water, if the bugs don't eat our crops, if no one burns
us out the way they did those people over the hill, if, if, if!"

Allie sighed. "Shit, it's if, if, if anywhere you go. This place isn't
so bad." She was sitting on her sleepsack, holding the sleeping Justin's
head in her lap. As she spoke, she stroked the boy's hair. It occurred
to me, not for the first time, that no matter how tough Allie tried to
seem, that little boy was the key to her. Children were the keys to most
of the adults present.

"There are no guarantees anywhere," I agreed. "But if we're willing to
work, our chances are good here. I've got some seed in my pack. We can
buy more. What we have to do at this point is more like gardening than
farming. Everything will have to be done by hand---composting, watering,
weeding, picking worms or slugs or whatever off the crops and killing
them one by one if that's what it takes. As for water, if our well still
has water in it now, in October, I don't think we have to worry about it
going dry on us. Not this year, anyway.

"And if people threaten us or our crop, we kill them. That's all. We
kill them, or they kill us. If we work together, we can defend
ourselves, and we can protect the kids. A community's first
responsibility is to protect its children---the ones we have now and the
ones we will have."

There was silence for a while, people digesting, perhaps measuring it
against what they had to look forward to if they left this place and
continued north.

"We should decide," I said. "We have building and planting to do here.
We have to buy more food, more seed and tools." It was time for
directness: "Allie, will you stay?"

She looked across the dead fire at me, stared hard at me as though she
hoped to see something on my face that would give her an answer.

"What seed do you have?" she asked.

I drew a deep breath. "Most of it is summer stuff---corn, peppers,
sunflowers, eggplant, melons, tomatoes, beans, squash. But I have some
winter things; peas, carrots, cabbage, broccoli, winter squash, onions,
asparagus, herbs, several kinds of greens. ... We can buy more, and
we've got the stuff left in this garden plus what we can harvest from
the local oak, pine, and citrus trees. I brought tree seeds too: more
oak, citrus, peach, pear, nectarine, almond, walnut, a few others. They
won't do us any good for a few years, but they're a hell of an
investment in the future."

"So is a kid," Allie said. "I didn't think I would be dumb enough to say
this, but yeah, I'll stay. I want to build something, too. I never had a
chance to build anything before."

Allie and Justin were a yes, then.

"Harry? Zahra?"

"Of course we're staying," Zahra said.

Harry frowned. "Wait a minute. We don't have to."

"I know. But we are. If we can make a community like Lauren says and not
have to hire out to strangers and trust them when they shouldn't be
trusted, then we should do it. If you grew up where I did, you'd know we
should."

"Harry," I said, "I've known you all my life. You're the closest thing
to a brother that I have left. You aren't really thinking about leaving,
are you?" It wasn't the world's best argument. He had been both cousin
and lover to Joanne, and he'd let her go when he could have gone with
her.

"I want something of my own," he said. "Land, a home, maybe a store or a
small farm. Something that's mine. This land is Bankole's."

"Yes," Bankole said. "And you'll be getting the use of it rent
free---and all the water you need. What are those things going to cost
you farther north---if you can get them at all farther north---if you
can get yourself out of California."

"But there's no work here!"

"There's nothing but work here, boy. Work, and a lot of cheap land. How
cheap do you think land will be up where you and all the rest of the
world are heading?"

Harry thought about that, then spread his hands. "What I'm worried about
is spending all our money here, then discovering we can't make it here."

I nodded. "I've thought about that, too, and it bothers me. But it's a
possibility anywhere, you know. You could settle in Oregon or
Washington, not be able to get a job, and run out of money. Or you could
be forced to work under the conditions that Emery and Grayson found.
After all, with rivers of people flowing north, looking for work,
employers can take their pick, and pay what they feel like paying."

Emery put her arm around Tori, who sat drowsing next to her. "You might
be able to get a job as a driver," she said. "They like white men to be
drivers. If you can read and write, and if you'd do the work, you might
get hired."

"I don't know how to drive, but I could learn," Harry said. "You mean
driving those big armored trucks, don't you?"

Emery looked confused. "Trucks? No, I mean driving people. Making them
work. Pushing them to work faster. Making them do ... whatever the
owners says."

Harry's expression had dissolved from hopeful to horrified to outraged.
"Jesus God, do you think I'd do that! How could you think I'd do
anything like that?"

Emery shrugged. It startled me that she could be indifferent about such
a thing, but she seemed to be. "Some people think it's a good job," she
said. "Last driver we had, he used to do something with computers. I
don't know what. His company went out of business and he got a job
driving us. I think he liked it."

"Em," Harry said. He pitched his voice low and waited until she looked
at him. "Are you telling me you believe I'd like a job pushing slaves
around and taking away their children?"

She stared back, searching his face. "I hope not," she said. And then,
"Sometimes jobs like that are the only jobs---slave or slave driver. I
heard that just on this side of the Canada border there are a lot of
factories with jobs like that."

I frowned. "Factories that use slave labor?"

"Yeah. Workers make things for companies in Canada or Asia. They don't
get paid much, so they get into debt. They get hurt or sick, too. Their
drinking water's not clean and the factories are dangerous---full of
poisons and machines that crush or cut you. But people think they can
make some cash and then quit. I worked with some women who had gone up
there, taken a look, and come back."

"And you were going up there?" Harry demanded.

"Not to work in those places. The women warned me."

"I've heard of places like that," Bankole said. "They were supposed to
provide jobs for that northward-flowing river of people. President
Donner's all for them. The workers are more throw-aways than slaves.
They breathe toxic fumes or drink contaminated water or get caught in
unshielded machinery. ... It doesn't matter. They're easy to
replace---thousands of jobless for every job."

"Borderworks," Mora said. "Not all of them are that bad. I heard some
pay cash wages, not company scrip."

"Is that where you want to go?" I asked. "Or do you want to stay here?"

He looked down at Doe who was still nibbling at a piece of sweet potato.
"I want to stay here," he said, surprising me. "I'm not sure you have a
hope in hell of building anything here, but you're just crazy enough to
make it work." And if it didn't work, he'd be no worse off than he was
when he escaped slavery. He could rob someone and continue his journey
north. Or maybe not. I'd been thinking about Mora. He did a lot to keep
people away from him---keep them from knowing too much about him, keep
them from seeing what he was feeling, or that he was feeling
anything---a male sharer, desperate to hide his terrible vulnerability?
Sharing would be harder on a man. What would my brothers have been like
as sharers? Odd that I hadn't thought of that before.

"I'm glad you're staying," I said. "We need you." I looked at Travis and
Natividad. "We need you guys, too. You're staying, aren't you?"

"You know we are," Travis said. "Although I think I agree more than I
want to with Mora. I'm not sure we have a prayer of succeeding here."

"We'll have whatever we can shape," I said. And I turned to face Harry.
He and Zahra had been whispering together. Now he looked at me.

"Mora's right," he said. "You're nuts."

I sighed.

"But this is a crazy time," he continued. "Maybe you're what the time
needs---or what we need. I'll stay. I may be sorry for it, but I'll
stay."

Now the decision is acknowledged, and we can stop arguing about it.
Tomorrow we'll begin to prepare a winter garden. Next week, several of
us will go into town to buy tools, more seed, supplies. Also, it's time
we began to build a shelter. There are trees enough in the area, and we
can dig into the ground and into the hills. Mora says he's built slave
cabins before. Says he's eager to build something better, something fit
for human beings. Besides, this far north and this near the coast, we
might get some rain.

Sunday, October 10, 2027

Today we had a funeral for Bankole's dead---the five people who died in
the fire. The cops never came. At last Bankole has decided that they
aren't going to come, and that it's time his sister and her family had a
decent burial. We collected all the bones that we could find, and
yesterday, Natividad wrapped them in a shawl that she had knitted years
ago. It was the most beautiful thing she owned.

"A thing like that should serve the living," Bankole said when she
offered it.

"You are living," Natividad said. "I like you. I wish I could have met
your sister."

He looked at her for a while. Then he took the shawl and hugged her.
Then, beginning to cry, he went off by himself into the trees, out of
our sight. I let him alone for an hour or so, then went after him.

I found him, sitting on a fallen log, wiping his face. I sat with him
for some time, saying nothing. After a while, he got up, waited for me
to stand, then headed back toward our camp.

"I would like to give them a grove of oak trees," I said. "Trees are
better than stone---life commemorating life."

He glanced back at me. "All right."

"Bankole?"

He stopped, looked at me with an expression I could not read.

"None of us knew her," I said. "I wish we had. I wish I had, no matter
how much I would have surprised her."

He managed a smile. "She would have looked at you, then looked at me,
then, right in front of you, I think she would have said, 'Well, there's
no fool like an old fool.' Once she got that out of her system, I think
she would have gotten to like you."

"Do you think she could stand ... or forgive company now?"

"What?"

I drew a deep breath and wondered about what I meant to say. It could go
wrong. He could misunderstand. It still needed to be said.

"We'll bury your dead tomorrow. I think you're right to want to do it.
And I think we should bury our dead as well. Most of us have had to walk
away---or run---away from our unburned, un-buried dead. Tomorrow, we
should remember them all, and lay them to rest if we can."

"Your family?"

I nodded. "Mine, Zahra's, Harry's, Allie's---both her son and her
sister---maybe Emery's sons, maybe others that I don't know about. Mora
doesn't talk about himself much, but he must have losses. Doe's mother,
perhaps."

"How do you want to do it?" he asked.

"Each of us will have to bury our own dead. We knew them. We can find
the words."

Words from the Bible, perhaps?

"Any words, memories, quotations, thoughts, songs. ... My father had a
funeral, even though we never found his body. But my three youngest
brothers and my stepmother had nothing. Zahra saw them die, or I
wouldn't have any idea what happened to them." I thought for a moment.
"I have acorns enough for each of us to plant live oak trees to our
dead---enough to plant one for Justin's mother, too. I'm thinking about
a very simple ceremony. But everyone should have a chance to speak. Even
the two little girls."

He nodded. "I don't have any objection. It isn't a bad idea." And a few
steps later: "There's been so much dying. There's so much more to come."

"Not for us, I hope."

He said nothing for a while. Then he stopped and put his hand on my
shoulder to stop me. At first he only stood looking at me, almost
studying my face. "You're so young," he said. "It seems almost criminal
that you should be so young in these terrible times. I wish you could
have known this country when it was still salvageable."

"It might survive," I said, "changed, but still itself."

"No." He drew me to his side and put one arm around me. "Human beings
will survive of course. Some other countries will survive. Maybe they'll
absorb what's left of us. Or maybe we'll just break up into a lot of
little states quarreling and fighting with each other over whatever
crumbs are left. That's almost happened now with states shutting
themselves off from one another, treating state lines as national
borders. As bright as you are, I don't think you understand---I don't
think you can understand what we've lost. Perhaps that's a blessing."

"God is Change," I said.

"Olamina, that doesn't mean anything."

"It means everything. Everything!"

He sighed. "You know, as bad as things are, we haven't even hit bottom
yet. Starvation, disease, drug damage, and mob rule have only begun.
Federal, state, and local governments still exist---in name at
least---and sometimes they manage to do something more than collect
taxes and send in the military. And the money is still good. That amazes
me. However much more you need of it to buy anything these days, it is
still accepted. That may be a hopeful sign---or perhaps it's only more
evidence of what I said: We haven't hit bottom yet."

"Well, the group of us here doesn't have to sink any lower," I said.

He shook his shaggy head, his hair, beard, and serious expression making
him look more than a little like an old picture I used to have of
Frederick Douglass.

"I wish I believed that," he said. Perhaps it was his grief talking. "I
don't think we have a hope in hell of succeeding here."

I slipped my arm around him. "Let's go back," I said. "We've got work to
do."

So today we remembered the friends and the family members we've lost. We
spoke our individual memories and quoted Bible passages, Earthseed
verses, and bits of songs and poems that were favorites of the living or
the dead.

Then we buried our dead and we planted oak trees.

Afterward, we sat together and talked and ate a meal and decided to call
this place Acorn.

By Lauren Oya Olamina

**Here we are---**

**Energy,**

**Mass,**

**Life,**

**Shaping life,**

**Mind,**

**Shaping Mind,**

**God,**

**Shaping God.**

**Consider---**

**We are born**

**Not with purpose,**

**But with potential.**

**T[HEY'LL MAKE A GOD]{.small} of her.**

**I think that would please her, if she could know about it. In spite of
all her protests and denials, she's always needed devoted, obedient
followers---disciples---who would listen to her and believe everything
she told them. And she needed large events to manipulate. All gods seem
to need these things.**

**Her legal name was Lauren Oya Olamina Bankole. To those who loved her
or hated her, she was simply "Olamina."**

**She was my biological mother.**

**She is dead.**

**I have wanted to love her and to believe that what happened between
her and me wasn't her fault. I've wanted that. But instead, I've hated
her, feared her, needed her. I've never trusted her, though, never
understood how she could be the way she was---so focused, and yet so
misguided, there for all the world, but never there for me. I still
don't understand. And now that she's dead, I'm not even sure I ever
will. But I must try because I need to understand myself, and she is
part of me. I wish that she weren't, but she is. In order for me to
understand who I am, I must begin to understand who she was. That is my
reason for writing and assembling this book.**

**It has always been my way to sort through my feelings by writing. She
and I had that in common. And along with the need to write, she also
developed a need to draw. If she had been born in a saner time, she
might have become a writer as I have or an artist.**

**I've gathered a few of her drawings, although she gave most of these
away during her lifetime. And I have copies of all that was saved of her
writings. Even some of her early, paper notebooks have been copied to
disk or crystal and saved. She had a habit, during her youth, of hiding
caches of food, money, and weaponry in out-of-the-way places or with
trusted people, and being able to go straight back to these years later.
These saved her life several times, and also they saved her words, her
journals and notes and my father's writings. She managed to badger him
into writing a little. He wrote well, although he didn't like doing it.
I'm glad she badgered him. I'm glad to have known him at least through
his writing. I wonder why I'm not glad to have known her through hers.**

**"God is Change," my mother believed. That was what she said in the
first of her verses in *Earthseed: The First Book of the Living.***

***All that you touch***

***You Change.***

***All that you Change***

***Changes you.***

***The only lasting truth***

***Is Change.***

***God***

***Is Change.***

**The words are harmless, I suppose, and metaphorically true. At least
she began with some species of truth. And now she's touched me one last
time with her memories, her life, and her damned Earthseed.**

[FROM]{.small} *Memories of Other Worlds*

[BY TAYLOR FRANKLIN BANKOLE]{.small}

[I HAVE READ THAT]{.small} the period of upheaval that journalists have
begun to refer to as "the Apocalypse" or more commonly, more bitterly,
"the Pox" lasted from 2015 through 2030---a decade and a half of chaos.
This is untrue. The Pox has been a much longer torment. It began well
before 2015, perhaps even before the turn of the millennium. It has not
ended.

I have also read that the Pox was caused by accidentally coinciding
climatic, economic, and sociological crises. It would be more honest to
say that the Pox was caused by our own refusal to deal with obvious
problems in those areas. We caused the problems: then we sat and watched
as they grew into crises. I have heard people deny this, but I was born
in 1970. I have seen enough to know that it is true. I have watched
education become more a privilege of the rich than the basic necessity
that it must be if civilized society is to survive. I have watched as
convenience, profit, and inertia excused greater and more dangerous
environmental degradation. I have watched poverty, hunger, and disease
become inevitable for more and more people.

Overall, the Pox has had the effect of an installment-plan World War
III. In fact, there were several small, bloody shooting wars going on
around the world during the Pox. These were stupid affairs---wastes of
life and treasure. They were fought, ostensibly, to defend against
vicious foreign enemies. All too often, they were actually fought
because inadequate leaders did not know what else to do. Such leaders
knew that they could depend on fear, suspicion, hatred, need, and greed
to arouse patriotic support for war.

Amid all this, somehow, the United States of America suffered a major
nonmilitary defeat. It lost no important war, yet it did not survive the
Pox. Perhaps it simply lost sight of what it once intended to be, then
blundered aimlessly until it exhausted itself.

What is left of it now, what it has become, I do not know.

**Taylor Franklin Bankole was my father. From his writings, he seems to
have been a thoughtful, somewhat formal man who wound up with my
strange, stubborn mother even though she was almost young enough to be
his granddaughter.**

**My mother seems to have loved him, seems to have been happy with him.
He and my mother met during the Pox when they were both homeless
wanderers. But he was a 57-year-old doctor---a family practice
physician---and she was an 18-year-old girl. The Pox gave them terrible
memories in common. Both had seen their neighborhoods destroyed---his in
San Diego and hers in Robledo, a suburb of Los Angeles. That seems to
have been enough for them. In 2027, they met, liked each other, and got
married. I think, reading between the lines of some of my father's

had found. He wanted to keep her safe from the chaos of the time, safe
from the gangs, drugs, slavery, and disease. And of course he was
flattered that she wanted him. He was human, and no doubt tired of being
alone. His first wife had been dead for about two years when they met.**

**He couldn't keep my mother safe of course. No one could have done

[SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER]{.small} 26, 2032

Today is Arrival Day, the fifth anniversary of our establishing a
community called Acorn here in the mountains of Humboldt County.

In perverse celebration of this, I've just had one of my recurring
nightmares. They've become rare in the past few years---old enemies with
familiar nasty habits. I know them. They have such soft, easy
beginnings.... This one was, at first, a visit to the past, a trip home,
a chance to spend time with beloved ghosts.

My old home has come back from the ashes. This doesn't surprise me,
somehow, although I saw it burn years ago. I walked through the rubble
that was left of it. Yet here it is restored and filled with
people---all the people I knew as I was growing up. They sit in our
front rooms in rows of old metal folding chairs, wooden kitchen and
dining room chairs, and plastic stacking chairs, a silent congregation
of the scattered and the dead.

Church service is already going on, and, of course, my father is
preaching. He looks as he always has in his church robes: tall, broad,
stern, straight---a great black wall of a man with a voice you not only
hear, but feel on your skin and in your bones. There's no corner of the
meeting rooms that my father cannot reach with that voice. We've never
had a sound system---never needed one. I hear and feel that voice again.

Yet how many years has it been since my father vanished? Or rather, how
many years since he was killed? He must have been killed. He wasn't the
kind of man who would abandon his family, his community, and his church.
Back when he vanished, dying by violence was even easier than it is
today. Living, on the other hand was almost impossible.

He left home one day to go to his office at the college. He taught his
classes by computer, and only had to go to the college once a week, but
even once a week was too much exposure to danger. He stayed overnight at
the college as usual. Early mornings were the safest times for working
people to travel. He started for home the next morning and was never
seen again.

We searched. We even paid for a police search. Nothing did any good.

This happened many months before our house burned, before our community
was destroyed. I was 17. Now I'm 23 and I'm several hundred miles from
that dead place.

Yet all of a sudden, in my dream, things have come right again.

I'm at home, and my father is preaching. My stepmother is sitting behind
him and a little to one side at her piano. The congregation of our
neighbors sits before him in the large, not-quite-open area formed by
our living room, dining room, and family room. This is a broad L-shaped
space into which even more than the usual 30 or 40 people have crammed
themselves for Sunday service. These people are too quiet to be a
Baptist congregation---or at least, they're too quiet to be the Baptist
congregation I grew up in. They're here, but somehow not here. They're
shadow people. Ghosts.

Only my own family feels real to me. They're as dead as most of the
others, and yet they're alive! My brothers are here and they look the
way they did when I was about 14. Keith, the oldest of them, the worst
and the first to die, is only 11. This means Marcus, my favorite brother
and always the best-looking person in the family, is 10. Ben and Greg,
almost as alike as twins, are eight and seven. We're all sitting in the
front row, over near my stepmother so she can keep an eye on us. I'm
sitting between Keith and Marcus to keep them from killing each other
during the service.

When neither of my parents is looking, Keith reaches across me and
punches Marcus hard on the thigh. Marcus, younger, smaller, but always
stubborn, always tough, punches back. I grab each boy's fist and
squeeze. I'm bigger and stronger than both of them and I've always had
strong hands. The boys squirm in pain and try to pull away. After a
moment, I let them go. Lesson learned. They let each other alone for at
least a minute or two.

In my dream, their pain doesn't hurt me the way it always did when we
were growing up. Back then, since I was the oldest, I was held
responsible for their behavior. I had to control them even though I
couldn't escape their pain. My father and stepmother cut me as little
slack as possible when it came to my hyperempathy syndrome. They refused
to let me be handicapped. I was the oldest kid, and that was that. I had
my responsibilities.

Nevertheless I used to feel every damned bruise, cut, and burn that my
brothers managed to collect. Each time I saw them hurt, I shared their
pain as though I had been injured myself. Even pains they pretended to
feel, I did feel. Hyperempathy syndrome is a delusional disorder, after
all. There's no telepathy, no magic, no deep spiritual awareness.
There's just the neurochemically-induced delusion that I feel the pain
and pleasure that I see others experiencing. Pleasure is rare, pain is
plentiful, and, delusional or not, it hurts like hell.

So why do I miss it now?

What a crazy thing to miss. Not feeling it should be like having a
toothache vanish away. I should be surprised and happy. Instead, I'm
afraid. A part of me is gone. Not being able to feel my brothers' pain
is like not being able to hear them when they shout, and I'm afraid.

The dream begins to become a nightmare.

Without warning, my brother Keith vanishes. He's just gone. He was the
first to go---to die---years ago. Now he's vanished again. In his place
beside me, there is a tall, beautiful woman, black-brown-skinned and
slender with long, crow-black hair, gleaming. She's wearing a soft,
silky green dress that flows and twists around her body, wrapping her in
some intricate pattern of folds and gathers from neck to feet. She is a
stranger.

She is my mother.

She is the woman in the one picture my father gave me of my biological
mother. Keith stole it from my bedroom when he was nine and I was
twelve. He wrapped it in an old piece of a plastic tablecloth and buried
it in our garden between a row of squashes and a mixed row of corn and
beans. Later, he claimed it wasn't his fault that the picture was ruined
by water and by being walked on. He only hid it as a joke. How was he
supposed to know anything would happen to it? That was Keith. I beat the
hell out of him. I hurt myself too, of course, but it was worth it. That
was one beating he never told our parents about.

But the picture was still ruined. All I had left was the memory of it.
And here was that memory, sitting next to me.

My mother is tall, taller than I am, taller than most people. She's not
pretty. She's beautiful. I don't look like her. I look like my father,
which he used to say was a pity. I don't mind. But she is a stunning
woman.

I stare at her, but she does not turn to look at me. That, at least, is
true to life. She never saw me. As I was born, she died. Before that,
for two years, she took the popular "smart drug" of her time. It was a
new prescription medicine called Paracetco, and it was doing wonders for
people who had Alzheimer's disease. It stopped the deterioration of
their intellectual function and enabled them to make excellent use of
whatever memory and thinking ability they had left. It also boosted the
performance of ordinary, healthy young people. They read faster,
retained more, made more rapid, accurate connections, calculations, and
conclusions. As a result, Paracetco became as popular as coffee among
students, and, if they meant to compete in any of the highly paid
professions, it was as necessary as a knowledge of computers.

My mother's drug taking may have helped to kill her. I don't know for
sure. My father didn't know either. But I do know that her drug left its
unmistakable mark on me---my hyperempathy syndrome. Thanks to the
addictive nature of Paracetco---a few thousand people died trying to
break the habit---there were once tens of millions of us.

Hyperempaths, we're called, or hyperempathists, or sharers. Those are
some of the polite names, And in spite of our vulnerability and our high
mortality rate, there are still quite a few of us.

I reach out to my mother. No matter what she's done, I want to know her.
But she won't look at me. She won't even turn her head. And somehow, I
can't quite reach her, can't touch her. I try to get up from my chair,
but I can't move. My body won't obey me. I can only sit and listen as my
father preaches.

Now I begin to know what he is saying. He has been an indistinct
background rumble until now, but now I hear him reading from the
twenty-fifth chapter of Matthew, quoting the words of Christ:

" 'For the kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling into a far country
who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods. And unto
One he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every
man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey'
"

My father loved parables---stories that taught, stories that presented
ideas and morals in ways that made pictures in people's minds. He used
the ones he found in the Bible, the ones he plucked from history, or
from folk tales, and of course he used those he saw in his life and the
lives of people he knew. He wove stories into his Sunday sermons, his
Bible classes, and his computer-delivered history lectures. Because he
believed stories were so important as teaching tools, I learned to pay
more attention to them than I might have otherwise. I could quote the
parable that he was reading now, the parable of the talents. I could
quote several Biblical parables from memory. Maybe that's why I can hear
and understand so much now. There is preaching between the bits of the
parable, but I can't quite understand it. I hear its rhythms rising and
falling, repeating and varying, shouting and whispering. I hear them as
I've always heard them, but I can't catch the words---except for the
words of the parable.

" 'Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the
same and made them another five talents. And likewise he that had
received two, he also gained another two. But he that had received one
went out and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.' "

My father was a great believer in education, hard work, and personal
responsibility. "Those are our talents," he would say as my brothers'
eyes glazed over and even I tried not to sigh. "God has given them to
us, and he'll judge us according to how we use them."

The parable continues. To each of the two servants who had traded well
and made profit for their lord, the lord said, " 'Well done, thou good
and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will
make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.'
"

But to the servant who had done nothing with his silver talent except
bury it in the ground to keep it safe, the lord said harsher words. "
'Thou wicked and slothful servant ...' " he began. And he ordered his
men to, " 'Take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which
hath ten talents. For unto everyone that hath shall be given, and he
shall have in abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away
even that which he hath.' "

When my father has said these words, my mother vanishes. I haven't even
been able to see her whole face, and now she's gone.

I don't understand this. It scares me. I can see now that other people
are vanishing too. Most have already gone. Beloved ghosts....

My father is gone. My stepmother calls out to him in Spanish the way she
did sometimes when she was excited, "No! How can we live now? They'll
break in. They'll kill us all! We must build the wall higher!"

And she's gone. My brothers are gone. I'm alone---as I was alone that
night five years ago. The house is ashes and rubble around me. It
doesn't burn or crumble or even fade to ashes, but somehow, in an
instant, it is a ruin, open to the night sky. I see stars, a quarter
moon, and a streak of light, moving, rising into the sky like some life
force escaping. By the light of all three of these, I see shadows,
large, moving, threatening. I fear these shadows, but I see no way to
escape them. The wall is still there, surrounding our neighborhood,
looming over me much higher than it ever truly did. So much higher....It
was supposed to keep danger out. It failed years ago. Now it fails
again. Danger is walled in with me. I want to run, to escape, to hide,
but now my own hands, my feet begin to fade away. I hear thunder. I see
the streak of light rise higher in the sky, grow brighter.

Then I scream. I fall. Too much of my body is gone, vanished away. I
can't stay upright, can't catch myself as I fall and fall and fall....

I awoke here in my cabin at Acorn, tangled in my blankets, half on and
half off my bed. Had I screamed aloud? I didn't know. I never seem to
have these nightmares when Bankole is with me, so he can't tell me how
much noise I make. It's just as well. His practice already costs him
enough sleep, and this night must be worse than most for him.

It's three in the morning now, but last night, just after dark, some
group, some gang, perhaps, attacked the Dovetree place just north of us.
There were, yesterday at this time, 22 people living at Dovetree---the
old man, his wife, and his two youngest daughters; his five married
sons, their wives and their kids. All of these people are gone except
for the two youngest wives and the three little children they were able
to grab as they ran. Two of the kids are hurt, and one of the women has
had a heart attack, of all things. Bankole has treated her before. He
says she was born with a heart defect that should have been taken care
of when she was a baby. But she's only twenty, and around the time she
was born, her family, like most people, had little or no money. They
worked hard themselves and put the strongest of their kids to work at
ages eight or ten. Their daughter's heart problem was always either
going to kill her or let her live. It wasn't going to be fixed.

Now it had nearly killed her. Bankole was sleeping---or more likely
staying awake---in the clinic room of the school tonight, keeping an eye
on her and the two injured kids. Thanks to my hyperempathy syndrome, he
can't have his clinic here at the house. I pick up enough of other
people's pain as things are, and he worries about it. He keeps wanting
to give me some stuff that prevents my sharing by keeping me sleepy,
slow, and stupid. No, thanks!

So I awoke alone, soaked with sweat, and unable to get back to sleep.
It's been years since I've had such a strong reaction to a dream. As I
recall, the last time was five years ago right after we settled here,
and it was this same damned dream. I suppose it's come back to me
because of the attack on Dovetree.

That attack shouldn't have happened. Things have been quieting down over
the past few years. There's still crime, of course---robberies,
break-ins, abductions for ransom or for the slave trade. Worse, the poor
still get arrested and indentured for indebtedness, vagrancy, loitering,
and other "crimes." But this thing of raging into a community and
killing and burning all that you don't steal seems to have gone out of
fashion. I haven't heard of anything like this Dovetree raid for at
least three years.

Granted, the Dovetrees did supply the area with home-distilled whiskey
and homegrown marijuana, but they've been doing that since long before
we arrived. In fact, they were the best-armed farm family in the area
because their business was not only illegal, but lucrative. People have
tried to rob them before, but only the quick, quiet burglar-types have
had any success. Until now.

I questioned Aubrey, the healthy Dovetree wife, while Bankole was
working on her son. He had already told her that the little boy would be
all right, and I felt that we had to find out what she knew, no matter
how upset she was. Hell, the Dovetree houses are only an hour's walk
from here down the old logging road. Whoever hit Dovetree, we could be
next on their list.

Aubrey told me the attackers wore strange clothing, She and I talked in
the main room of the school, a single, smoky oil lamp between us on one
of the tables. We sat facing one another across the table, Aubrey
glancing every now and then at the clinic room, where Bankole had
cleaned and eased her child's scrapes, burns, and bruises. She said the
attackers were men, but they wore belted black tunics---black dresses,
she called them---which hung to their thighs. Under these, they wore
ordinary pants---either jeans or the kind of camouflage pants that she
had seen soldiers wear.

"They were like soldiers," she said. "They sneaked in, so quiet. We
never saw them until they started shooting at us. Then, bang! All at
once. They hit all our houses. It was like an explosion---maybe twenty
or thirty or more guns going off all at just the same time."

And that wasn't the way gangs operated. Gangsters would have fired
raggedly, not in unison. Then they would have tried to make individual
names for themselves, tried to grab the best-looking women or steal the
best stuff before their friends could get it.

"They didn't steal or burn anything until they had beaten us, shot us."
Aubrey said. "Then they took our fuel and went straight to our fields
and burned our crops. After that, they raided the houses and barns. They
all wore big white crosses on their chests---crosses like in church. But
they killed us. They even shot the kids. Everybody they found, they
killed them. I hid with my baby or they would have shot him and me."
Again, she stared toward the clinic room.

That killing of children...that was a hell of a thing. Most
thugs---except for the worst psychotics---would keep the kids alive for
rape and then for sale. And as for the crosses, well, gangsters might
wear crosses on chains around their necks, but that wasn't the sort of
thing most of their victims would get close enough to notice. And
gangsters were unlikely to run around in matching tunics all sporting
white crosses on their chests. This was something new.

Or something old.

I didn't think of what it might be until after I had let Aubrey go back
to the clinic to bed down next to her child. Bankole had given him
something to help him sleep. He did the same for her, so I won't be able
to ask her anything more until she wakes up later this morning. I
couldn't help wondering, though, whether these people, with their
crosses, had some connection with my current least favorite presidential
candidate, Texas Senator Andrew Steele Jarret. It sounds like the sort
of thing his people might do---a revival of something nasty out of the
past. Did the Ku Klux Klan wear crosses---as well as burn them? The
Nazis wore the swastika, which is a kind of cross, but I don't think
they wore it on their chests. There were crosses all over the place
during the Inquisition and before that, during the Crusades. So now we
have another group that uses crosses and slaughters people. Jarret's
people could be behind it. Jarret insists on being a throwback to some
earlier, "simpler" time. Now does not suit him. Religious tolerance does
not suit him. The current state of the country does not suit him. He
wants to take us all back to some magical time when everyone believed in
the same God, worshipped him in the same way, and understood that their
safety in the universe depended on completing the same religious rituals
and stomping anyone who was different. There was never such a time in
this country. But these days when more than half the people in the
country can't read at all, history is just one more vast unknown to
them.

Jarret supporters have been known, now and then, to form mobs and burn
people at the stake for being witches. Witches! In 2032! A witch, in
their view, tends to be a Moslem, a Jew, a Hindu, a Buddhist, or, in
some parts of the country, a Mormon, a Jehovah's Witness, or even a
Catholic. A witch may also be an atheist, a "cultist," or a well-to-do
eccentric. Well-to-do eccentrics often have no protectors or much that's
worth stealing. And "cultist" is a great catchall term for anyone who
fits into no other large category, and yet doesn't quite match Jarret's
version of Christianity. Jarret's people have been known to beat or
drive out Unitarians, for goodness' sake. Jarret condemns the burnings,
but does so in such mild language that his people are free to hear what
they want to hear. As for the beatings, the tarring and feathering, and
the destruction of "heathen houses of devil-worship," he has a simple
answer: "Join us! Our doors are open to every nationality, every race!
Leave your sinful past behind, and become one of us. Help us to make
America great again." He's had notable success with this
carrot-and-stick approach. *Join us and thrive, or whatever happens to
you as a result of your own sinful stubbornness is your problem.* His
opponent Vice President Edward Jay Smith calls him a demagogue, a
rabble-rouser, and a hypocrite. Smith is right, of course, but Smith is
such a tired, gray shadow of a man. Jarret, on the other hand, is a big,
handsome, black-haired man with deep, clear blue eyes that seduce people
and hold them. He has a voice that's a whole-body experience, the way my
father's was. In fact, I'm sorry to say, Jarret was once a Baptist
minister like my father. But he left the Baptists behind years ago to
begin his own "Christian America" denomination. He no longer preaches
regular CA sermons at CA churches or on the nets, but he's still
recognized as head of the church.

It seems inevitable that people who can't read are going to lean more
toward judging candidates on the way they look and sound than on what
they claim they stand for. Even people who can read and are educated are
apt to pay more attention to good looks and seductive lies than they
should. And no doubt the new picture ballots on the nets will give
Jarret an even greater advantage.

Jarret's people see alcohol and drugs as Satan's tools. Some of his more
fanatical followers might very well be the tunic-and-cross gang who
destroyed Dovetree.

And we are Earthseed. We're "that cult," "those strange people in the
hills," "those crazy fools who pray to some kind of god of change." We
are also, according to some rumors I've heard, "those devil-worshiping
hill heathens who take in children. *And what do you suppose they do
with them?*" Never mind that the trade in abducted or orphaned children
or children sold by desperate parents goes on all over the country and
everyone knows it. No matter. The hint that some cult is taking in
children for "questionable purposes" is enough to make some people
irrational.

That's the kind of rumor that could hurt us even with people who aren't
Jarret supporters. I've only heard it a couple of times, but it's still
scary.

At this point, I just hope that the people who hit Dovetree were some
new gang, disciplined and frightening, but only after profit. I hope....

But I don't believe it. I do suspect that Jarret's people had something
to do with this. And I think I'd better say so today at Gathering. With
Dovetree fresh in everyone's mind, people will be ready to cooperate,
have more drills and scatter more caches of money, food, weapons,
records, and valuables. We can fight a gang. We've done that before when
we were much less prepared than we are now. But we can't fight Jarret.
In particular, we can't fight *President* Jarret. President Jarret, if
the country is mad enough to elect him, could destroy us without even
knowing we exist.

We are now 59 people---64 with the Dovetree women and children, if they
stay. With numbers like that, we barely do exist. All the more reason, I
suppose, for my dream.

My "talent," going back to the parable of the talents, is Earthseed. And
although I haven't buried it in the ground, I have buried it here in
these coastal mountains, where it can grow at about the same speed as
our redwood trees. But what else could I have done? If I had somehow
been as good at rabble-rousing as Jarret is, then Earthseed might be a
big enough movement by now to be a real target. And would that be
better?

I'm jumping to all kinds of unwarranted conclusions. At least I hope
they're unwarranted. Between my horror at what's happened down at
Dovetree and my hopes and fears for my own people, I'm upset and at
loose ends and, perhaps, just imagining things.

**T[HE ORIGINAL 13 SETTLERS]{.small} of Acorn, and thus the original 13
members of Earthseed, were my mother, of course, and Harry Balter and
Zahra Moss, who were also refugees from my mother's home neighborhood in
Robledo. There was Travis, Natividad, and Dominic Douglas, a young
family who became my mother's first highway converts. She met them as
both groups walked through Santa Barbara, California. She liked their
looks, recognized their dangerous vulnerability---Dominic was only a few
months old at the time---and convinced them to walk with Harry, Zahra,
and her in their long trek north where they all hoped to find better
lives.**

**Next came Allison Gilchrist and her sister Julian---Allie and Jill.
But Jill was killed later along the highway. At around the same time, my
mother spotted my father and he spotted her. Neither of them was shy and
both seemed willing to act on what they felt. My father joined the
growing group. Justin Rohr became Justin Gilchrist when the group found
him crying alongside the body of his dead mother. He was about three at
the time, and he and Allie wound up coming together in another small
family. Last came the two families of ex-slaves that joined together to
become one growing family of sharers. These were Grayson Mora and his
daughter Doe and Emery Solis and her daughter Tori.**

**That was it: four children, four men, and five women.**

**They should have died. That they survived at all in the unforgiving
world of the Pox might qualify as a miracle---although of course,
Earthseed does not encourage belief in miracles.**

**No doubt the group's isolated location---well away from towns and
paved roads---helped keep it safe from much of the violence of the time.
The land it settled on belonged to my father. There was on that land
when the group arrived one dependable well, a half-ruined garden, a
number of fruit and nut trees, and groves of oaks, pines, and redwoods.
Once the members of the group had pooled their money and bought
handcarts, seed, small livestock, hand tools, and other necessities,
they were almost independent. They vanished into their hills and
increased their numbers by birth, by adoption of orphans, and by
conversion of needy adults. They scavenged what they could from
abandoned farms and settlements, they traded at street markets and
traded with their neighbors. One of the most valuable things they traded
with one another was knowledge.**

**Every member of Earthseed learned to read and to write, and most knew
at least two languages---usually Spanish and English, since those were
the two most useful. Anyone who joined the group, child or adult, had to
begin at once to learn these basics and to acquire a trade. Anyone who
had a trade was always in the process of teaching it to someone else. My
mother insisted on this, and it does seem sensible. Public schools had
become rare in those days when ten-year-old children could be put to
work. Education was no longer free, but it was still mandatory according
to the law. The problem was, no one was enforcing such laws, just as no
one was protecting child laborers.**

**My father had the most valuable skills in the group. By the time he
married my mother, he had been practicing medicine for almost 30 years.
He was a multiple rarity for their location: well educated,
professional, and Black. Black people in particular were rare in the
mountains. People wondered about him. Why was he there? He could have
been making a better living in some small, established town. The area
was littered with tiny towns that would be glad to have any doctor. Was
he competent? Was he honest? Was he clean? Could he be trusted looking
after wives and daughters? How could they be sure he was really a doctor
at all? My father apparently wrote nothing at all about this, but my
mother wrote about everything.**

**She says at one point: "Bankole heard the same whispers and rumors I
did at the various street markets and in occasional meetings with
neighbors, and he shrugged. He had us to keep healthy and our
work-related injuries to treat. Other people had their first aid kits,
their satellite phone nets, and, if they were lucky, their cars or
trucks. These vehicles tended to be old and undependable, but some
people had them. Whether or not they called Bankole was their
business.**

**"Then, thanks to someone else's misfortune, things improved. Jean
Holly's appendix flared up and all but ruptured, and the Holly family,
our eastern neighbors, decided that they had better take a chance on
Bankole.**

**"Once Bankole had saved the woman's life, he had a talk with the
family. He told them exactly what he thought of them for waiting so long
to call him, for almost letting a woman with five young children die. He
spoke with that intense quiet courtesy of his that makes people squirm.
The Hollys took it. He became their doctor.**

**"And the Hollys mentioned him to their friends the Sullivans, and the
Sullivans mentioned him to their daughter who had married into the Gama
family, and the Gamas told the Dovetrees because old Mrs. Dovetree---the
matriarch---had been a Gama. That was when we began to get to know our
nearest neighbors, the Dovetrees."**

**Speaking of knowing people, I wish more than ever that I could have
known my father. He seems to have been an impressive man. And, perhaps,
it would have been good for me to know this version of my mother,
struggling, focused, but very young, very human. I might have liked
these people.**

[MONDAY, SEPTEMBER]{.small} 27, 2032

I'm not sure how to talk about today. It was intended to be a quiet day
of salvaging and plant collecting after yesterday's uncomfortable
Gathering and determined anniversary celebration. We have, it seems, a
few people who think Jarret may be just what the country needs---apart
from his religious nonsense. The thing is, you can't separate Jarret
from the "religious nonsense." You take Jarret and you get beatings,
burnings, tarrings and featherings. They're a package. And there may be
even nastier things in that package. Jarret's supporters are more than a
little seduced by Jarret's talk of making America great again. He seems
to be unhappy with certain other countries. We could wind up in a war.
Nothing like a war to rally people around flag, country, and great
leader.

Nevertheless, some of our people---the Peralta and Faircloth families in
particular---might be leaving us soon.

"I've got four kids left alive," Ramiro Peralta said yesterday at
Gathering. "Maybe with a strong leader like Jarret running things,
they'll have a chance to stay alive."

He's a good guy, Ramiro is, but he's desperate for solutions, for order
and stability. I understand that. He used to have seven kids and a wife.
He'd lost three of his kids and his wife to a fire set by an angry,
frightened, ignorant mob who decided to cure a nasty cholera epidemic
down in Los Angeles by burning down the area of the city where they
thought the epidemic had begun. I kept that in mind as I answered him.
"Think, Ramiro," I said. "Jarret doesn't have any answers! How will
lynching people, burning their churches, and starting wars help your
kids to live?"

Ramiro Peralta only turned away from me in anger. He and Alan Faircloth
looked across the Gathering room---the school room---at one another.
They're both afraid. They look at their children---Alan has four kids,
too---and they're afraid and ashamed of their fear, ashamed of their
powerlessness. And they're tired. There are millions of people like
them---people who are frightened and just plain tired of all the chaos.
They want someone to do something. Fix things. Now!

Anyway, we had a stormy Gathering and an uneasy anniversary celebration.
Interesting that they fear Edward Jay Smith's supposed incompetence more
than they fear Jarret's obvious tyranny.

So this morning, I was ready for a day of walking, thinking, and plant
collecting with friends. We still travel in groups of three or four when
we leave Acorn because the mountains, on the roads and off them, can be
dangerous. But for nearly five months now, we've had no trouble while
salvaging. I suppose, though, that that can be dangerous in itself. Sad.
Raids and gangs are dangerous because they kill outright. Peace is
dangerous because it encourages complacency and carelessness---which
also kills sooner or later.

In spite of the Dovetree raid, we were, to be honest, more complacent
than usual because we were heading for a place that we knew. It was a
burned, abandoned farmhouse far from Dovetree where we'd spotted some
useful plants. In particular, there was aloe vera for use in easing
burns and insect bites, and there were big mounds of agave. The agave
was a handsome, variegated species---blue-green leaves edged in
yellow-white. It must have been growing and propagating untended for
years in what was once the front yard of the farmhouse. It was one of
the large, vicious varieties of agave, each individual plant an upturned
rosette of stiff, fibrous, fleshy leaves, some of them over a meter long
in the big parent plants. Each leaf was tipped with a long, hard,
dagger-sharp spike, and for good measure, each leaf was edged in jagged
thorns that were tough enough to saw through human flesh. We intended to
use them to do just that.

On our first visit, we had taken some of the smallest plants, the
youngest offsets. Now we meant to dig up as many of the rest as we could
bundle into our handcart. The cart was already more than half full of
things we had salvaged from the rotting storage shed of a collapsed
cabin a couple of miles from where the agave grew. We had found dusty
pots, pans, buckets, old books and magazines, rusted hand tools, nails,
log chains, and wire. All had been damaged by water and time, but most
could be cleaned and repaired or cannibalized for parts or at least
copied. We learn from all the work we do. We've become very competent
makers and repairers of small tools. We've survived as well as we have
because we keep learning. Our customers have come to know that if they
buy from us, they'll get their money's worth.

Salvaging from abandoned gardens and fields is useful, too. We collect
any herb, fruit, vegetable, or nut-producing plant, any plant at all
that we know or suppose to be useful. We have, always, a special need
for spiny, self-sufficient desert plants that will tolerate our climate.
They serve as part of our thorn fence.

Cactus by cactus, thornbush by thornbush, we've planted a living wall in
the hills around Acorn. Our wall won't keep determined people out, of
course. No wall will do that. Cars and trucks will get in if their
owners are willing to absorb some damage to their vehicles, but cars and
trucks that work are rare and precious in the mountains, and most fuels
are expensive.

Even intruders on foot can get in if they're willing to work at it. But
the fence will hamper and annoy them. It will make them angry, and
perhaps noisy. It will, when it's working well, encourage people to
approach us by the easiest routes, and those we guard 24 hours a day.

It's always best to keep an eye on visitors.

So we intended to harvest agave.

We headed for what was left of the farmhouse. It was built on a low rise
overlooking fields and gardens. It was supposed to be our last stop
before we went home. It came near to being our last stop, period.

There was an old gray housetruck parked near the ruin of the house. We
didn't see the truck at first. It was hidden behind the larger of two
chimneys that still stood like head and footstones, commemorating the
burned house. I mentioned to Jorge Cho the way the chimneys looked.
Jorge was with us because in spite of his youth, he's good at spotting
useful salvage that other people might dismiss as junk.

"What are head and footstones?" he asked me. He meant it. He's 18 and an
escapee from the Los Angeles area like I am, but his experience has been
very different. While I was being cared for and educated by educated
parents, he was on his own. He speaks Spanish and a little remembered
Korean, but no English. He was seven when his mother died of flu and
twelve when an earthquake killed his father. It collapsed the old brick
building in which the family had been squatting. So at 12, Jorge alone
was responsible for his younger sister and brother. He took care of
them, somehow, and taught himself to read and write Spanish with
occasional help from an old wino acquaintance. He worked at hard,
dangerous, often illegal jobs; he salvaged; and when necessary, he
stole. He and his sister and brother, three Korean kids in a poor
neighborhood of Mexican and Central American refugees, managed to
survive, but they had no time to learn nonessentials. Now we're teaching
them to read, write, and speak English because that will enable them to
communicate with more people. And we're teaching them history, farming,
carpentry, and incidental things---like what head and footstones are.

The other two members of the salvage team were Natividad Douglas and
Michael Kardos. Jorge and I are sharers. Mike and Natividad aren't. It's
too dangerous to send out a majority of sharers on any team. Sharers are
too vulnerable. We suffer no matter who gets hurt. But two and two is a
good team, and the four of us work well together. It's unusual for us
all to be careless at the same time, but today, we managed it.

The fireplace and chimney that had concealed the truck from us had been
the end wall of what was once a large living room. The fireplace was big
enough to roast a whole cow. The whole affair was just big enough to
conceal a medium-sized housetruck.

We saw the thing only an instant before it opened fire on us.

We were armed, as usual, with our automatic rifles and our sidearms, but
against the armor and the firepower of even a modest housetruck, those
were nothing.

We dropped to the ground under a spray of dirt and rock kicked up by
bullets hitting the ground around us. We scrambled backward, down the
rise on which the house was built. The crest of the rise was our only
cover. All we could do was lie at the foot of its slope and try to keep
all our body parts out of sight. We didn't dare stand or even sit up.
There was nowhere for us to go. Bullets chewed the ground in front of
us, then behind us, beyond the protection of the rise.

There were no trees nearby---not even a large bush between us and the
truck. We were in the thinnest part of the remains of a desert garden.
We had not reached our agaves yet---could not reach them now. They
couldn't have shielded us anyway. The only thing some of us might have
at least concealed ourselves behind was a young, far-from-bulletproof
young Washingtonia palm tree that we had passed on the way in. Its
fronds were spread around it, low and green like a big bush, but it was
at the north end of the house, and we were pinned down at the south end.
The truck, too, was parked at the south end. The tree would be of no use
to us. Nearest to us were a few aloe vera plants, a prickly pear, a
small yucca, and a few weeds and tufts of grass.

None of these would do us any good. If the people in the truck had been
making full use of their equipment, even the rise would not have done us
any good. We would already be dead. I wondered how they had managed to
miss us when we arrived. Were they just trying to scare us off? I didn't
think so. The shooting had gone on for too long.

At last, it stopped.

We lay still, playing dead, listening for the whine of a truck engine,
for footsteps, for voices, for any of the sounds that might tell us we
were being hunted---or that our assailants had gone. There was only the
low moan of the wind and the rustling of some of the plants. I lay,
thinking about the pine trees that I had seen on the high ridge far
behind the house. I could see them in my mind's eye, and somehow, it was
all I could do to stop myself from raising my head to get a look at
them, to see whether they were as far away as I thought they were. The
weed-strewn fields of what had been the farm swept back and up into the
hills. Above them were the pines that could shelter and conceal, but
they were far beyond our reach. I sighed.

Then we heard the sound of a child, crying.

We all heard it---a few short sobs, then nothing. The child sounded very
young---not a baby, but young, exhausted, helpless, hopeless.

The four of us looked at one another. We all care about kids. Michael
has two and Natividad has three. Bankole and I have been trying to have
one. Jorge, I'm glad to say, hasn't made anyone pregnant yet, but he's
been a surrogate father to his younger sister and brother for six years.
He knows as well as the rest of us do what dangers lie in wait for
unprotected children.

I raised my head just enough to get a quick look at the truck and the
area around it. A housetruck, armed, armored, and locked up tight
shouldn't---couldn't let the sound of a child's crying escape. And the
sound had seemed normal, not amplified or modified by truck speakers.

Therefore, one of the truck's doors must be open. Wide open.

I couldn't see much through the weeds and grasses, and I didn't dare to
raise my head above them. All I could make out were the sunlit shapes of
the chimney, the truck beside it, the weeds in the fields behind both
chimney and truck, the distant trees, and....

Movement?

Movement far away in the weeds of the field, but coming closer.

Natividad pulled me down. "What is the matter with you?" she whispered
in Spanish. For Jorge's sake, it was best to stay with Spanish while we
were in trouble. "There are crazy people in that truck! Do you want to
die?"

"Someone else is coming," I said. "More than one person, coming through
the fields."

"I don't care! Stay down!"

Natividad is one of my best friends, but sometimes having her along is
like having your mother with you.

"Maybe the crying is intended to lure us out," Michael said. "People
have used children as lures before." He's a suspicious man, Michael is.
He questions everything. He and his family have been with us for two
years now, and I think it took him six months to accept us and to decide
that we had no evil intentions toward his wife or his twin girls. This,
even though we took them in and helped them when we found his wife
alone, giving birth to the twins in a ruin of a shack where they had
been squatting. The place was near a stream, so they had water, and they
had a couple of scavenged pots. But they were armed only with an
ancient, empty .22 target pistol and a knife. They were all but
starving, eating pine nuts, wild plants, and an occasional small animal
that Michael trapped or killed with a rock. In fact, he was away looking
for food when his wife Noriko went into labor.

Michael agreed to join us because he was terrified that in spite of his
odd jobs, begging, stealing, and scavenging, his wife and babies might
starve. We never asked more of them than that they do their share of the
work to keep the community going and that they respect Earthseed by not
preaching other belief systems. But to Michael, this sounded like
altruism, and Michael didn't believe in altruism. He kept expecting to
catch us selling people into slavery or prostituting them. He didn't
begin to relax until he realized that we were, in fact, practicing what
we preached. Earthseed was and is the key to us. We had a way of life
that he thought was sensible and a goal, a Destiny that he thought was
crazy, but we weren't up to anything that would harm his family. And his
family was the key to him. Once he accepted us, he and Noriko and the
girls settled in and made Acorn very much their home. They're good
people. Even Michael's suspiciousness can be a good thing. Most of the
time, it helps us keep alert.

"I don't think the crying was intended to lure us out," I said. "But
something is wrong here. That's obvious. The people in that truck should
either make sure we're dead or they should leave."

"And we shouldn't hear them," Jorge said. "No matter how loud that kid
yells, we shouldn't hear a thing."

Natividad spoke up. "Their guns shouldn't have missed us," she said. "In
a truck like that, the guns should be run by a computer. Automatic
targeting. The only way you can miss is if you insist on doing things
yourself. You might forget to put your guns on the computer or you might
leave the computer off if you just wanted to scare people. But if you're
serious, you shouldn't *keep* missing." Her father had taught her more
about guns than most of the rest of our community knew.

"I don't think they missed us on purpose," I said. "It didn't feel like
that."

"I agree," Michael said. "So what's wrong over there?"

"Shit!" Jorge whispered. "What's wrong is the bastards are going to kill
us if we move!"

The guns went off again. I pressed myself against the ground and lay
there, frozen, eyes shut. The idiots in the truck meant to kill us
whether we moved or not, and their chances for success were excellent.

Then I realized that this time, they weren't shooting at us.

Someone screamed. Over the steady clatter of one of the truck's guns, I
heard someone scream in agony. I didn't move. When someone was in pain,
the only way I could avoid sharing the suffering was not to look.

Jorge, who should have known better, raised his head and looked.

An instant later he doubled up, thrashing and twisting in someone else's
agony. He didn't scream. Sharers who survive learn early to take the
pain and keep quiet. We keep our vulnerability as secret as we can.
Sometimes we manage not to move or give any sign at all. But Jorge hurt
too much to keep his body still. He clutched himself, crossing his arms
over his belly. At once, I felt a dull echo of his pain in my own
middle. It is incomprehensible to me that some people think of sharing
as an ability or a power---as something desirable.

"Fool," I said to Jorge, and held him until the pain passed from both of
us. I concealed my own pain as best I could so that we wouldn't develop
the kind of nasty feedback loop that I've learned we sharers are capable
of. We don't die of the pains that we see and share. We wish we could
sometimes, and there is danger in sharing too much pain or too many
deaths. These are individual matters. Five years ago I shared three or
four deaths fast, one after another. It hurt more than anything should
be able to hurt. Then it knocked me out. When I came to, I was numb and
sick and dazed long after there was any pain to share. With lesser
pains, it's enough to turn away. In minutes, the pain is over for us.
Deaths take much longer to get over.

The one good thing about sharing pain is that it makes us very slow to
cause pain to other people. We hate pain more than most people do.

"I'm okay," Jorge said after a while. And then, "Those guys out
there...I think they're dead. They must be dead."

"They're down anyway," Michael whispered as he looked where Jorge had
looked. "I can see at least three of them in the field beyond the
chimney and the truck." He squirmed backward so that he could relax and
no longer see or be seen over the rise. Sometimes I try to imagine what
it must be like to look at pain and feel nothing. My current recurring
nightmare is the closest I've come to that kind of freedom, not that it
felt like freedom. But to Michael feeling nothing must
be...well...normal.

Everything had gone quiet. The truck had not moved. It did nothing.

"They seem to need a moving target," I said.

"Maybe they're high on something," Natividad said. "Or maybe they're
just crazy. Jorge, are you sure you're okay?"

"Yes. I just want to get the hell out of here."

I shook my head. "We're stuck here, at least until it gets dark."

"If the truck has even the cheapest night-vision equipment, the dark
won't help us," Michael said.

I thought about that, then nodded. "Yes, but it shot at us and missed.
And it hasn't moved, even though two sets of people have found its
hiding place. I'd say either the truck or the people in it are not in
good working order. We'll stay here until dark, then we'll run. If we're
lucky, no one will wander in behind us before then and give us trouble
or draw the truck's attention back this way. But whatever happens, we'll
wait."

"Three people are dead," Michael said. "We should be dead ourselves.
Maybe before the night is over, we will be."

I sighed. "Shut up, Mike."

We waited through the cool autumn day. We were lucky that two days
before, the weather had turned cool. We were also lucky that it wasn't
raining. Perfect weather for getting pinned down by armed lunatics.

The truck never moved. No one else came along to trouble us or to draw
fire. We ate the food we had brought along for lunch and drank what was
left of our water. We decided that the trackers must think we were dead.
Well, we were content to play dead until the sun had set. We waited.

Then we moved. In the dark, we began to crawl toward the northward edge
of our cover. Moving this way, we hoped to put so much of the big
chimney between ourselves and the truck that the people in the truck
would not have time to see us and open fire before we got to better
cover behind the second chimney. Once we reached the second chimney, we
hoped to keep both chimneys between ourselves and the immobile truck as
we escaped. That was fine as long as the truck remained immobile. If it
moved, we were dead. Even if it didn't move, there would be a moment
when we were easy targets, when we had to run across open ground.

"Oh god, oh god, oh god," Jorge whispered through clenched teeth as he
stared at the stretch of open ground. If the truck managed to shoot
anyone, and he saw it, he would collapse. So would I.

"Don't look around," I reminded him. "Even if you hear shots, look
straight ahead, and run!"

But before we could start, the crying began again. There was no
mistaking the sound. It was the open, uninhibited sobbing of a child,
and this time, it didn't stop.

We ran. The sound of the crying might help to cover any sounds we made
over the uneven ground---although we weren't noisy. We've learned not to
be.

Jorge reached the smaller chimney first. I was next. Then Michael and
Natividad arrived together. Michael is short and lean and looks as quick
as he is. Natividad is stocky and strong and doesn't look quick at all,
but she tends to surprise people.

We all made it. There were no shots fired. And in the time it took us to
reach the smaller chimney, I found that I had changed my mind about
things.

The crying had not stopped or even paused. When I looked around the
small chimney toward the truck, I could see light---a broad swatch of
dim, blue-gray light. I couldn't see people, but it was clear that we
had guessed right. A side door of the truck was wide open.

We were all bunched together at the smaller chimney, the others peering
toward the down slope north of us. That was where they still expected to
go. There was starlight enough to light the way, and I could see Jorge,
bent down, his hands on his thighs as though he were about to run a
race.

The child was not sobbing now, but wailing---a thin, exhausted sound.
Best to move before the crying stopped. Also best to move before the
others understood what I meant to do---what I now knew I had to do. They
would follow me and back me up as long as I moved fast and didn't give
them time to think or argue.

"Let's go," Michael said.

I paid no attention. There was, I realized, a bad smell in the air,
swelling and fading in the evening breeze. It seemed to be coming from
the truck.

"Come on," Michael urged.

"No," I said, and waited until all three of them had turned to look at
me. Timing, now. "I want to see about that child," I said. "And I want
that truck."

I moved then, just ahead of their restraining hands and words.

I ran. I ran around the carcass of the house, shifting for an instant
from reality into my dream. I was running past the stark ruin of a
house, its chimneys, its few remaining black bones just visible against
the stars.

Just for an instant, I thought I saw shadowy dream forms. Shadows
rising, moving....

I shook off the feeling and stopped as I reached the larger chimney. I
edged around it, willing the truckers not to shoot me, terrified that
they would shoot me, moving fast in spite of the terror.

The blue-gray light was brighter now, and the smell had become a
sickening stench of rottenness that I found all too familiar.

I crouched low, hoping to be out of sight of the truck's cameras, and I
crossed in front of the truck---near enough to it to put out my hand and
touch it. Then I had reached the far side of it where the light was,
where the door must be open.

As I went, I almost fell over the crying child. It was a little girl of
perhaps six or seven. She was filthy beyond my ability to describe
filthiness. She sat in the dirt, crying, reaching up to wipe away tears
and rearrange some of the mud on her face.

She looked up and saw me just as I managed to stop myself from falling
over her. She stared at me, her mouth open, as I swung past her to level
my rifle into the blue-gray light of the truck's interior.

I don't know what I expected to see: Drunken people sprawled about? An
orgy? More filth? People aiming their weapons at me? Death?

There was death nearby. I knew that. The smell was unmistakable.

What I did see in the blue-gray light was another child, another little
girl, asleep at one of the truck's monitors. She had put her head down
against the edge of the control board, and was snoring a little. The
blue-gray light came from the three screens that were on. All three
showed only gray, grainy electronic "snow."

There were also three dead people in the truck.

That is, I thought they must be dead. It was clear that all had been
wounded---shot, I thought---several times. In fact, they must have been
shot some time ago---days ago, perhaps. The blood on their bodies had
dried and darkened.

I don't share any feeling with the unconscious or the dead, I'm glad to
say. No matter how they look or smell, they don't bother me that much.
I've seen too many of them.

I climbed into the truck, leaving the crying child outside to the care
of the others. I could already hear Natividad talking to her. Natividad
loves kids, and they seem to trust her as soon as they meet her.

Jorge and Michael had come up behind me as I climbed into the truck.
Both froze as they saw the sleeping child and the sprawled bodies. Then
Michael moved past me to check the bodies. He, Natividad, Allie
Gilchrist, and Zahra Balter have learned to assist Bankole. They have no
official medical or nurse training, but Bankole has trained them---is
training them---and they're careful and serious about their work.

Michael checked the bodies and discovered that only one, a slender,
dark, middle-aged man, was dead. He had been shot in the chest and
abdomen. The other two were a big, naked, middle-aged, blond woman shot
in the legs and thighs and a clothed blond boy of about 15 shot in the
legs and left shoulder. These people were covered with dried blood.
Nevertheless, Michael found faint heartbeats in the woman and the boy.

"We've got to get them to Bankole," he said. "This is too much for me."

"Oh, shit," Jorge moaned, and he ran outside and threw up. I couldn't
blame him. He had just noticed the maggots in the man's eyes, mouth, and
wounds, and in the wounds of the other two. I looked away myself. All of
us can deal with that kind of thing, but no one enjoys it. To tell the
truth, I was more concerned about whether one or both of the wounded
people would come to. I positioned myself so that I would not have to
look at them. They were in no shape to attack us, of course, but they
would drag me into their pain if they were conscious.

Keeping my back to Michael and his patients, I awoke the sleeping child.
She wasn't quite as filthy as the little girl we'd found outside, but
she did need a bath.

She squinted up at me, groggy, uncomprehending. Then she gave a little
squeal and tried to dart past me, and out the door.

I caught her and held her while she struggled and screamed. I spoke to
her, whispered to her, tried to reassure her, did all I could to bring
her out of her hysteria. "It's all right, honey, it's all right. Don't
cry. You'll be all right. We'll take care of you, don't worry. We'll
take care of you...." I rocked her and crooned to her as though to a
much younger child.

The dead and wounded were no doubt her family. She and the other child
had been alone here with them for...how long? They would need all the
care we could give them. After much more screaming and struggling, she
began to take refuge in my arms, holding on to me instead of trying to
escape. From my arms, she stared, huge-eyed, at the others.

Jorge stood watch at the monitors once his stomach settled. Natividad
had calmed the other little girl and found a clean cloth and some water.
These she used to wash the child's face, hands, and arms. Michael had
left the wounded woman and boy to examine the truck's controls. Of the
four of us, he was the only one who knew how to drive.

"Any trouble?" I asked him.

He shook his head. "Not even any sign of boobytraps. I guess they would
have worried about the kids springing them."

"Can you drive it?"

"No problem."

"Drive it, then. It's ours. Let's go home."

The truck was all right. There was plenty of power in its batteries, and
Michael had no trouble finding and using its night-vision equipment. It
carried infrared, ambient light, and radar devices. All of these were of
good quality, and all worked. The little girls must not have understood
how to use them---as they had not known how to drive. Or perhaps they
had known how to operate everything, but had not known where to go with
it. Who could little children go to for help, after all? If they had no
adult relatives, even the police would either sell them illegally or
indenture them legally. Indenturing indigents, young and old, is much in
fashion now. The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments---the ones
abolishing slavery and guaranteeing citizenship rights---still exist,
but they've been so weakened by custom, by Congress and the various
state legislatures, and by recent Supreme Court decisions that they
don't much matter. Indenturing indigents is supposed to keep them
employed, teach them a trade, feed them, house them, and keep them out
of trouble. In fact, it's just one more way of getting people to work
for nothing or almost nothing. Little girls are valued because they can
be used in so many ways, and they can be coerced into being quick,
docile, disposable labor.

No doubt these two girls have been taught to be terrified of strangers.
Then, with their parents and brother out of action, they had been left
on their own to defend their family and their home. In their blind fear,
they had, they must have, shot at us and shot and hit three men who gave
no sign of being anything worse than wanderers, perhaps salvagers.
Michael and Natividad did go out to check on these men before we left
while Jorge and I loaded our handcart and its contents onto the truck.

The three men were dead. They had hard currency and holstered
guns---which Michael and Natividad collected. We covered them with rocks
and left them. But they had been even less of a danger to the housetruck
than we were. If they had walked right up to the truck, a locked door
would have kept them out. Their old nine-millimeter semi-automatics
would have had no chance against the truck's armor. But the little girls
hadn't realized that.

We got them home to Acorn, and they're getting baths, food, comfort, and
rest. Bankole is working on their mother and brother. He was not happy
to have new patients. Our clinic has never been so full, and he has all
his students and some volunteers helping him. He says he doesn't know
whether he'll be able to save this new mother and son. He has a few
simple instruments and an intricate little diagnostic unit that he saved
when he fled his home in San Diego five years ago. And he has a few
medicines---drugs to ease pain, fight infection, and otherwise keep us
healthy. If the boy lives, Bankole doesn't know whether he'll walk
again.

Bankole will do his best for them. And Allie Gilchrist and May are
taking care of the little girls. The girls have been lucky, at least, in
having us find them. They'll be safe with us.

And now, at last, we have something we've needed for years. We have a
truck.

[WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER]{.small} 29, 2032

With all the work that my Bankole has had to do to help the wounded
woman and boy and the wounded Dovetrees, he didn't get around to
shouting at me over the truck incident until last night. And, of course,
he didn't shout. He tends not to. It's a pity. His disapproval might be
easier to take if it were quick and loud. It was, as usual, quiet and
intense.

"It's a shame that so many of your unnecessary risks pay off so well,"
he said to me as we lay in bed last night. "You're a fool, you know.
It's as though you think you can't be killed. My god, girl, you're old
enough to know better."

"I wanted the housetruck," I said. "And I realized we might be able to
get it. And we might be able to help a child. We kept hearing one of
them crying."

He turned his head to look at me for several seconds, his mouth set.
"You've seen children led down the road in convict collars or chains,"
he said. "You've seen them displayed as enticements before houses of
prostitution. Are you going to tell me you did this because you heard
one crying?"

"I do what I can," I said. "When I can do more, I will. You know that."

He just looked at me. If I didn't love him, I might not like him much at
times like these. I took his hand and kissed it, and held it. "I do what
I can." I repeated, "And I wanted the housetruck."

"Enough to risk not only yourself, but your whole team---four people?"

"The risk in running away empty-handed was at least as great as the risk
of going for the truck."

He made a sound of disgust and withdrew his hand. "So now you've got a
battered old housetruck," he muttered.

I nodded. "So now we have it. We need it. You know we do. It's a
beginning."

"It's not worth anyone's life!"

"It didn't cost any of our lives!" I sat up and looked down at him. I
needed to have him see me as well as he could in the dim light from the
window. I wanted to have him know that I meant what I was saying. "If I
had to die," I said, "if I had to get shot by strangers, shouldn't it be
while I was trying to help the community, and not just while I was
trying to run away?"

He raised his hands and gave me an ironic round of applause. "I knew you
would say something like that. Well, I never thought you were stupid.
Obsessed, perhaps, but not stupid. That being the case, I have a
proposition for you."

He sat up and I moved close to him and pulled the blankets up around us.
I leaned against him and sat, waiting. Whatever he had to say, I felt
that I'd gotten my point across. If he wanted to call my thinking
obsessive, I didn't care.

"I've been looking at some of the towns in the area," he said.
"Saylorville, Halstead, Coy---towns that are a few miles off the
highway. None of them need a doctor now, but one probably will someday
soon. How would you feel about living in one of those towns?"

I sat still, surprised. He meant it. Saylorville? Halstead? Coy? These
are communities so small that I'm not sure they qualify as towns. Each
has no more than a few families and businesses huddled together between
the highway---U.S. 101---and the sea. We trade at their street markets,
but they're closed societies, these towns. They tolerate "foreign"
visitors, but they don't like us. They've been burned too many times by
strangers passing through---people who turned out to be thieves or
worse. They trust only their own and long-established neighboring
farmers. Did Bankole think that they would welcome us? Except for a
larger town called Prata, the nearest towns are almost all White. Prata
is White and Latino with a sprinkling of Asians. We're you name it:
Black, White, Latino, Asian, and any mixture at all---the kind of thing
you'd expect to find in a city. The kids we've adopted and the ones who
have been born to us think of all the mixing and matching as normal.
Imagine that.

Bankole and I, both Black, have managed to mix things up age-wise. He's
always being mistaken for my father. When he corrects people, they wink
at him or frown or grin. Here in Acorn, if people don't understand us,
at least they accept us.

"I'm content here," I said. "The land is yours. The community is ours.
With our work, and with Earthseed to guide us, we're building something
good here. It will grow and spread. We'll see that it does. But for now,
nothing in any of those towns is ours."

"It can be," he said. "You don't realize how valuable a physician is to
an isolated community."

"Oh, don't I? I know how valuable you are to us."

He turned his head toward me. "More valuable than a truck?"

"Idiot," I said. "You want to hear praise? Fine. Consider yourself
praised. You know how many of our lives you've saved---including mine."

He seemed to think about that for a moment. "This is a healthy young
group of people," he said. "Except for the Dovetree woman, even your
most recent adoptees are healthy people who've been injured, not sick
people. We have no old people." He grinned. "Except me. No chronic
problems except for Katrina Dovetree's heart. Not even a problem
pregnancy or a child with worms. Almost any town in the area needs a
doctor more than Acorn does."

"They need any doctor. We need you. Besides, they have what they need."

"As I've said, they won't always."

"I don't care." I moved against him. "You belong here. Don't even think
about going away."

"Thinking is all I can do about it right now. I'm thinking about a safe
place for us, a safe place for you when I'm dead."

I winced.

"I'm an old man, girl. I don't kid myself about that."

"Bankole---"

"I have to think about it. I want you to think about it too. Do that for
me. Just think about it."

I [CANNOT KNOW WHAT]{.small} the end will be of all of Olamina's
dreaming, striving, and certainty. I cannot recall ever feeling as
certain of anything as she seems to be of Earthseed, a belief system
that she herself created---or, as she says, a network of truths that she
has simply recognized. I was always a doubter when it came to religion.
How irrational of me, then, to love a zealot. But then, both love and
zealotry are irrational states of mind.

Olamina believes in a god that does not in the least love her. In fact,
her god is a process or a combination of processes, not an entity. It is
not consciously aware of her---or of anything. It is not conscious at
all. "God is Change," she says and means it. Some of the faces of her
god are biological evolution, chaos theory, relativity theory, the
uncertainty principle, and, of course, the second law of thermodynamics.
"God is Change, and, in the end, God prevails."

Yet Earthseed is not a fatalistic belief system. God can be directed,
focused, speeded, slowed, shaped. All things change, but all things need
not change in all ways. God is inexorable, yet malleable. Odd. Hardly
religious at all. Even the Earthseed Destiny seems to have little to do
with religion.

"We are Earthseed," Olamina says. "We are the children of God, as all
fractions of the universe are the children of God. But more immediately
we are the children of our particular Earth." And within those words
lies the origin of the Destiny. That portion of humanity that is
conscious, that knows it is Earthseed, and that accepts its Destiny is
simply trying to leave the womb, the Earth, to be born as all young
beings must do eventually.

Earthseed is Olamina's contribution to what she feels should be a
species-wide effort to evade, or at least to lengthen the
specialize-grow-die evolutionary cycle that humanity faces, that every
species faces.

"We can be a long-term success and the parents, ourselves, of a vast
array of new peoples, new species," she says, "or we can be just one
more abortion. We can, we must, scatter the Earth's living
essence---human, plant, and animal---to extrasolar worlds: 'The Destiny
of Earthseed is to take root among the stars.' "

Grand words.

She hopes and dreams and writes and believes, and perhaps the world will
let her live for a while, tolerating her as a harmless eccentric. I hope
that it will. I fear that it may not.

**My father has, in this piece, defined Earthseed very well and defined
it in fewer words than I could have managed. When my mother was a child,
protected and imprisoned by the walls of her neighborhood, she dreamed
of the stars. Literally, at night she dreamed of them. And she dreamed
of flying. I've seen her flying dreams mentioned in her earliest
writings. Awake or asleep, she dreamed of these things. As far as I'm
concerned, that's what she was doing when she created her Earthseed
Destiny and her Earthseed verses: dreaming. We all need dreams---our
fantasies---to sustain us through hard times. There's no harm in that as
long as we don't begin to mistake our fantasies for reality as she did.
It seems that she doubted herself from time to time, but she never
doubted the dream, never doubted Earthseed. Like my father, I can't feel
that secure about any religion. That's odd, considering the way I was
raised, but it's true.**

**I've seen religious passion in other people, though---love for a
compassionate God, fear of an angry God, fulsome praise and desperate
pleading for a God that rewards and punishes. All that makes me wonder
how a belief system like Earthseed---very demanding but offering so
little comfort from such an utterly indifferent God---should inspire any
loyalty at all.**

**In Earthseed, there is no promised afterlife. Earthseed's heaven is
literal, physical---other worlds circling other stars. It promises its
people immortality only through their children, their work, and their
memories. For the human species, immortality is something to be won by
sowing Earthseed on other worlds. Its promise is not of mansions to live
in, milk and honey to drink, or eternal oblivion in some vast whole of
nirvana. Its promise is of hard work and brand-new possibilities,
problems, challenges, and changes. Apparently, that can be surprisingly
seductive to some people. My mother was a surprisingly seductive
person.**

**There is an Earthseed verse that goes like this:**

***God is Change.***

***God is Infinite,***

***Irresistible,***

***Inexorable,***

***Indifferent.***

***God is Trickster,***

***Teacher,***

***Chaos,***

***Clay---***

***God is Change.***

***Beware:***

***God exists to shape***

***And to be shaped.***

**This is a terrifying God, implacable, faceless, yet malleable and
wildly dynamic. I suppose it will soon be wearing my mother's face. Her
second name was "Oya." I wonder whatever possessed my Baptist minister
grandfather to give her such a name. What did he see in her? "Oya" is
the name of a Nigerian Orisha---goddess---of the Yoruba people. In fact,
the original Oya was the goddess of the Niger River, a dynamic,
dangerous entity. She was also goddess of the wind, fire, and death,
more bringers of great change.**

[MONDAY, OCTOBER]{.small} 4, 2032

Krista Noyer died today.

That was her name: Krista Koslow Noyer. She never regained
consciousness. From the time we found her beaten, raped, and shot, lying
naked in her family's housetruck, she's been in a deep coma. We've kept
her and her wounded son in the clinic together. The five Dovetrees have
moved in with Jeff King and his children, but it seemed best to keep
Krista Noyer and her son at the clinic.

Zahra Baker and Allie Gilchrist helped to clean them up, then assisted
Bankole when he removed five bullets from their bodies---two from the
mother and three from the son. Zahra and Allie have been working with
Bankole longer than Mike and Natividad have. They're not doctors, of
course, but they know a lot. Bankole says he thinks they could function
well as nurse practitioners now.

He, all four of his helpers, and others who gave volunteer nursing care
did their best for the Noyers. After Krista Noyer's surgery, Zahra,
Natividad, Allie, Noriko Kardos, Channa Ryan, and Teresa Lin took turns
sitting with her, tending her needs. Bankole says he wanted women around
her in case she came to. He thought the sight of male strangers would
panic her.

I suspect that he was right. Poor woman.

At least her son was with her when she died. He lay on the bed next to
hers, sometimes reaching out to touch her. They were only separated by
one of our homemade privacy screens when personal things had to be done
for one of them. There was no screen between them when Krista died.

The boy's name is Danton Noyer, Junior. He wants to be called Dan. We
burned the body of Danton Noyer, Senior, as soon as we got it back to
Acorn. Now we'll have to burn his wife. We'll hold services for both of
them when Dan is well enough to attend.

[SUNDAY, OCTOBER]{.small} 17, 2032

We had a double funeral today for Danton Noyer, Senior and his wife
Krista.

Under Bankole's care, Dan Noyer is recovering. His legs and shoulder are
healing, and he can walk a little. Bankole says he can thank the maggots
for that. Not only did the disgusting little things keep his wounds
clean by eating the dead tissue, but they did no harm. This particular
kind have no appetite for healthy, living tissue. They eat the stuff
that would putrefy and cause gangrene, then, unless they're removed,
they metamorphose and fly away.

The little girls, Kassia and Mercy, had, at first, to be kept inside so
that they would not run away. They had nowhere to go, but they were so
frightened and confused that they kept trying to escape. When they were
allowed to visit their brother they had to be kept from hurting him.
They ran to him and would have piled onto his bed for reassurance and
comfort if May and Allie had not stopped them. May seems best able to
reach them. They seem to be adopting both women---and vice versa---but
they seem to have a special liking for May.

She's something of a mystery, our May. I'm teaching her to write so that
someday she'll be able to tell us her story. She looks as though she
might be a Latina, but she doesn't understand Spanish. She does
understand English, but doesn't speak it well enough to be understood
most of the time. That's because sometime before she joined us, someone
cut out her tongue.

We don't know who did it. I've heard that in some of the more religious
towns, repression of women has become more and more extreme. A woman who
expresses her opinions, "nags," disobeys her husband, or otherwise
"tramples her womanhood" and "acts like a man," might have her head
shaved, her forehead branded, her tongue cut out, or, worst case, she
might be stoned to death or burned. I've only heard about these things.
May is the first example of it that I've ever seen---if she is an
example. I'm glad to say her terrible wound had healed by the time she
came to us. We don't even know whether May is her real name. But she can
say, "May," and she's let us know we're to call her that. It's always
been clear that she loves kids and gets along well with them. Now, with
the little Noyer girls, it seems that she has a family. She's been
sharing a cabin with Allie Gilchrist and Allie's adopted son Justin for
the better part of a year. Now I suppose we'll have to either expand
Allie's cabin or begin work on a new one. In fact, we need to begin work
on two or three new ones. The Scolari family will be getting the next
one. They've been cooped up with the Figueroas long enough. Then the
Dovetrees, then the Noyers and May.

Dan Noyer is staying with Harry and Zahra Balter and their kids now that
he's well enough to get around on his own a little. It seemed best to
get him out of the clinic as soon as possible once his mother died. May
is already sharing her one room with the two little girls, so Bankole
looked for space for Dan elsewhere. The Balters volunteered. Also, May's
a sharer, and Dan still has bouts of pain. He doesn't complain, but May
would notice. I do when I'm around him. There's no hyperempathy in the
Balter family, so they can care for injured people without suffering
themselves.

It's been a busy few weeks. We've done several salvage runs with the
truck and gathered things we've never been able to gather in quantity
before: lumber, stone, bricks, mortar, cement, plumbing fixtures,
furniture, and pipe from distant abandoned ruins and from the Dovetree
place. We'll need it all. We're 67 people now with the Noyer children.
We're growing too fast.

And yet in another way, we're only creeping along. We're not only Acorn,
we're Earthseed, and we're still only a single tiny hill community
squeezed into too few cabins, and sharing an almost nineteenth-century
existence. The truck will improve our comfort, but...it's not enough. I
mean, it may be enough for Acorn, but it's not enough for Earthseed.

Not that I claim to know what would be enough. The thing that I want to
build is so damned new and so *vast*! I not only don't know how to build
it, but I'm not even sure what it will look like when I have built it.
I'm just feeling my way, using whatever I can do, whatever I can learn
to take one more step forward.

Here, for our infant Earthseed archives, is what I've learned so far
about what happened to the Noyers. I've talked to Kassia and Mercy
several times. And over the past three days, Dan has told me what he
could remember. He seemed to need to talk, in spite of his pain, and
with me around to complain to Bankole for him and see that he has his
medicine when he needs it, he's had less pain. On his own, he seems
willing to just lie there and hurt. Well, there's nothing wrong with
being stoic when you have to be, but there's enough unavoidable
suffering in the world. Why endure it when you don't have to?

The Noyers had driven up from Phoenix, Arizona, where food and water are
even more expensive than they are in the Los Angeles area. They sold
their houses---they owned two---some vacant land, their furniture,
Krista Noyer's jewelry, sold everything they could to get the money to
buy and equip an armed and armored housetruck big enough to sleep seven
people. The truck was intended to take the family to Alaska and serve as
their home there until the parents could get work and rent or buy
something better. Alaska is a more popular destination than ever these
days. When I left southern California, Alaska was a popular
dream---almost heaven. People struggled toward it, hoping for a
still-civilized place of jobs, peace, room to raise their children in
safety, and a return to the mythical golden-age world of the
mid-twentieth century. They expected to find no gangs, no slavery, no
free poor squatter settlements growing like cancers on the land, no
chaos. There was to be plenty of land for everyone, a warming climate,
cheap water, and many towns new and old, privatized and free, eager for
hardworking newcomers. As I said, heaven.

If what I've heard from travelers is true, the few who've managed to get
there---to buy passage on ships or planes or walk or drive hundreds,
even thousands, of miles, then somehow sneak across the closed border
with Canada to the also-closed Canadian-Alaskan border---have found
something far less welcoming. And last year, Alaska, weary of
regulations and restrictions from far away Washington, D.C., and even
more weary of the hoard of hopeful paupers flooding in, declared itself
an independent country. It seceded from the United States. First time
since the Civil War that a state's done that. I thought there might be
another civil war over the matter, the way President Donner and Alaskan
Governor---or rather, Alaskan *President*---Leontyev are snarling at one
another. But Donner has more than enough down here to keep him busy, and
neither Canada nor Russia, who have been sending us food and money, much
liked the idea of a war right next door to them. The only real danger of
civil war is from Andrew Steele Jarret if he wins the election next
month.

Anyway, in spite of the risks, people like the Noyers, hopeful and
desperate, still head for Alaska.

There were seven people in the Noyer family just a few days before we
found the truck. There was Krista and Danton, Senior; Kassia and Mercy,
our seven- and eight-year-old orphans; Paula and Nina, who were 12 and
13; and Dan, the oldest child. Dan is 15, as I guessed when I first saw
him. He's a big, baby-faced, blond kid. His father was small and
dark-haired. He inherited his looks and his size from his big, blond
mother, while the little girls are small and dark like Danton, Senior.
The boy is already almost two meters tall---a young giant with an
oldest-child's enhanced sense of responsibility for his sisters. Yet he,
like his father, had been unable to prevent Nina and Paula from being
raped and abducted three days before we found the truck.

The Noyers had gotten into the habit of parking their truck in some
isolated, sunny place like the south side of that burned-out farmhouse.
There they could let the kids spend some time outside while they cleaned
and aired the truck. They could unroll the truck's solar wings and
spread them wide so that the sun could recharge their batteries. To save
money, they used as much solar energy as possible. This meant driving at
night and recharging during the day---which worked all right because
people walked on the highways during the day. It's illegal to walk on
highways in California, but everyone does it. By custom now, most
pedestrians walk during the day, and most cars and trucks run at night.
The vehicles don't stop for anything that won't wreck them. I've seen
would-be high-jackers run down. No one stops.

But during the day, they park to rest and refuel.

Danton and Krista Noyer kept their children near them, but didn't post a
regular guard. They thought their isolation and general watchfulness
would protect them. They were wrong. While they were busy with
housekeeping, several men approached from their blind side---from the
north---so that the chimney that had not quite hidden them had blocked
their view. It was possible that these men had spotted the truck from
one of the ridges, then circled around to attack them. Dan thought they
had.

The intruders had rounded the wall and, an instant later, opened fire on
the family. They caught all seven Noyers outside the truck. They shot
Danton, Senior; Krista, and Dan. Mercy, who was nearest to the truck,
jumped inside and hid behind a box of books and disks. The intruders
grabbed the three other girls, but Nina, the oldest, created such a
diversion with her determined kicking, biting, gouging, and struggling,
breaking free, then being caught again, that Kassia, free for an
instant, was able to slither away from her captor and scramble into the
truck. Kassia did what Mercy had not. She slammed the truck door and
locked it, locked all doors.

Once she had done that, she was safer than she knew. Intruders fired
their guns into the truck's armor and tires. Both were marked, but not
punctured, not much damaged at all. The intruders even built a fire
against the side of the truck, but the fire went out without doing
damage.

After what seemed hours, the men went away.

The two little girls say they turned on the truck's monitors and looked
around. They couldn't find the intruders, but they were still afraid.
They waited longer. But it was terrible to wait alone in the truck, not
knowing what might be happening just beyond the range of the
monitors---on the other side of the chimney wall, perhaps. And there was
no one to take care of them, no one for them to turn to. At last,
staying in the truck alone was too much for them. They opened the door
nearest to the sprawled bodies of their parents and big brother.

The intruders were gone. They had taken the two older girls away with
them. Outside, Kassia and Mercy found only Dan and their parents. Dan
had come to, and was sitting on the ground, holding his mothers head on
his lap, stroking her face, and crying.

Dan had played dead while the intruders were there. He had given no sign
of life, even when one of the intruders kicked him. Stoic, indeed. He
heard them trying to get into the truck. He heard them cursing,
laughing, shouting, heard two of his sisters screaming as he had never
heard anyone scream. He heard his own heart beating. He thought he was
dying, bleeding to death in the dirt while his family was murdered.

Yet he did not die. He lost consciousness and regained it more than
once. He lost track of time. The intruders were there, then they were
gone. He could hear them, then he couldn't. His sisters were screaming,
crying, moaning, then they were silent.

He moved. Then gasping and groaning with pain, he managed to sit up. His
legs hurt so as he tried to stand that he screamed aloud and fell down
again. His mind, blurred by pain, blood loss, and horror, he looked
around for his family. There, near his legs, wet with his blood and her
own was his mother.

He dragged himself to her, then sat holding her head on his lap. How
long he sat here, all but mindless, he did not know. Then his little
sisters were shaking him, talking to him.

He stared at them. It took him a long time to realize that they were
really there, alive, and that behind them, the truck was open again.
Then he knew he had to get his parents inside it. He had to drive them
back down to the highway and into a town where there was a hospital, or
at least a doctor. He was afraid his father might be dead, but he
couldn't be sure. He knew his mother was alive. He could hear her
breathing. He had felt the pulse in her neck. He had to get help for
her.

Somehow, he did get them both into the truck. This was a long, slow,
terrible business. His legs hurt so. He felt so weak. He had grown fast,
and been proud of being man-sized and man-strong. Now he felt as weak as
a baby, and once he had dragged his parents into the truck, he was too
exhausted to climb into one of the driver's seats and drive. He couldn't
get help for his parents or look for his two lost sisters. He had to,
but he couldn't. He collapsed and lay on the floor, unable to move. His
consciousness faded. There was nothing.

It was a familiar sort of story---horrible and ordinary. Almost everyone
in Acorn has a horrible, ordinary story to tell.

Today we gave the Noyer children oak seedlings to plant in earth that
has been mixed with the ashes of their parents. We do this in memory of
our own dead, present and absent. None of the ashes of my family are
here, but five years ago when we decided to stay here, I planted trees
in their memory. Others have done the same for their dead. Nina and
Paula Noyer's ashes aren't here of course. Nina and Paula may not even
be dead. But they will be remembered here along with their parents. Once
Dan understood the ceremony, he asked for trees for Nina and Paula as
well as for his parents.

He said, "Some nights I wake up still hearing them screaming, hearing
those bastards laughing. Oh, god....They must be dead. But maybe they're
not. I don't know. Sometimes I wish I were dead. Oh god."

We've phoned our neighbors and friends in nearby towns about Nina and
Paula Noyer. We've left their names, their descriptions (garnered from
what Dan told me), and the offer of a reward in hard currency---Canadian
money. I doubt that anything will come of it, but we have to try. It
isn't as though we have an abundance of hard currency to spread around,
but because we're so careful, we do have some. Because of the truck,
we'll soon have more. To tell the truth, I'd try to buy the girls back
even if there were no truck. It's one thing to know that there are
children on the roads and in the towns being made to suffer for someone
else's pleasure. It's another to know that the two sisters of children
you know and like are being made to suffer. But there is the truck. All
the more reason for us to do what we can for the Noyer children.

We brought Dan to the funeral services on a cot that we used as a
stretcher. He can stand and walk. Bankole makes him do a little of that
every day. But he's still not up to standing or sitting for long periods
of time. We put him next to the slender young trees that Bankole planted
five years ago in memory of his sister and her family, who had lived on
this property before us. They were murdered before we arrived. Their
bodies were burned with their home. All we found of them were their
charred bones and a couple of rings. These are buried beneath the trees
just at the spot where Dan lay for the funeral.

The little girls planted their seedlings under our guidance, but not
with our help. The work was done by their hands. Perhaps the planting of
tiny trees in earth mixed with ashes doesn't mean much now, but they'll
grow up knowing that their parents' remains are here, that living trees
grow from those remains, and that today this community began to be their
home.

We moved Dan's cot so that he could use the garden trowel and watering
can, and we let him plant his own seedlings. He, too, did what he had to
do without help. The ritual was already important to him. It was
something he could do for his sisters and his parents. It was *all* he
could do for them.

When he had finished, he said the Lord's Prayer. It was the only formal
prayer he knew. The Noyers were nominal Christians---a Catholic mother,
an Episcopalian father, and kids who had never seen the inside of a
church.

Dan talked his sisters into singing songs in Polish---songs their mother
had taught them. They don't speak Polish, which is a pity. I'm always
glad when we can learn another language. No one in their family spoke
Polish except Krista, who had come with her parents from Poland to
escape war and uncertainty in Europe. And look what the poor woman had
stepped into.

The girls sang their songs. As young as they were, they had clear, sweet
voices. They were a delight to hear. Their mother must have been a good
teacher. When they had finished, and all the seedlings were watered in,
a few members of the community stood up to quote from Earthseed verses,
the Bible, The Book of Common Prayer, the Bhagavad-Gita, John Donne. The
quotations took the place of the words that friends and family would
have said to remember and give respect to the dead.

Then I said the words of the Earthseed verses that we've come to
associate with funerals, and with remembering the dead. "God is Change,"
I began.

Others repeated in soft voices, "God is Change. Shape God." Habits of
repetition and response have grown up almost without prompting among us.
Sad to say, we've had so many funerals in our brief existence as a
community that this ritual in particular is very familiar. Only last
week, we planted trees and spoke words for the Dovetrees. I said,

*"We give our dead*

*To the orchards*

*And the groves.*

*We give our dead*

*To life."*

I paused, took a deep breath, and continued in slow measured tones.

*"Death*

*Is a great Change*---

*Is life's greatest Change.*

*We honor our beloved dead.*

*As we mix their essence with the earth,*

*We remember them,*

*And within us,*

*They live."*

"We remember," the others whispered. "They live." I stood silent for a
moment, gazing out toward the tall persimmon, avocado, and citrus trees.
Bankole's sister and brother-in-law had planted these trees, had brought
them as young plants from southern California, half expecting them to
die here in a cooler climate. According to Bankole, many of them did
die, but some survived as the climate changed, warmed. Old-timers among
our neighbors complain about the loss of their fog, rain, and cool
temperatures. We don't mind, those of us from southern California. To us
it's as though we've come to a somewhat gentler version of the homes we
were forced to leave. Here, there is still water, space, not too much
debilitating heat, and some peace. Here, one can still have orchards and
groves. Here, life can still come from death.

The little girls had gone back to sit with May. May hugged them, one
small, dark-haired child in each arm, all three of them still, solemn,
listening.

I began a new verse, almost a chant,

*"Darkness*

*Gives shape to the light*

*As light*

*Shapes the darkness.*

*Death*

*Gives shape to life*

*As life*

*Shapes death.*

*God*

*And the universe*

*Share this wholeness*

*Each*

*Defining the other:*

*God*

*Gives shape to the universe*

*As the universe*

*Shapes God."*

And then, after a moment of silence, the last, the closing words:

*"We have lived before*

*We will live again*

*We will be silk,*

*Stone,*

*Mind,*

*Star,*

*We will be scattered,*

*Gathered,*

*Molded,*

*Probed.*

*We will live,*

*And we will serve life.*

*We will shape God*

*And God will shape us*

*Again,*

*Always again*

*Forevermore."*

Some people whispered that last word---echoed it. Zahra quoted in a
voice almost too soft to be heard,

*"God is Change,*

*And in the end*

*God prevails."*

Her husband Harry put his arm around her, and I saw that her eyes were
bright with unshed tears. She and Harry may be the most loyal, least
religious people in the community, but there are times when people need
religion more than they need anything else---even people like Zahra and
Harry.

O[UR COAST REDWOOD TREES]{.small} are dying.

Sequoia sempervirens is the botanical name for this tallest of all
trees, but many are evergreen no longer. Little by little from the tops
down, they are turning brown and dying.

I do not believe that they are dying as a result of the heat. As I
recall, there were many redwoods growing around the Los Angeles
area---Pasadena, Altadena, San Marino, places like that. I saw them
there when I was young. My mother had relatives in Pasadena and she used
to take me with her when she went to visit them. Redwoods growing that
far south reached nothing like the height of their kind here in the
north, but they did survive. Later, as the climate changed, I suppose
they died as so many of the trees down south died---or they were chopped
down and used to build shelters or to feed the cooking fires of the
homeless.

And now our younger trees have begun to die. This part of Humboldt
County along the coast and in the hills---the local people call these
coastal hills "mountains"---was cooler when I was a boy. It was foggy
and rainy---a soft, green climate, friendly to most growing things. I
believe it was already changing nearly 30 years ago when I bought the
land that became Acorn. In the not-too-distant future, I suppose it will
be little different from the way coastal southern California was a few
decades ago---hot, semiarid, more brown than green most of the time. Now
we are in the middle of the change. We still get a few substantial fall
and winter storms each year, and there are still morning fogs in the
spring and early summer.

Nevertheless, young redwood trees---those only about a century old, not
yet mature---are withering. A few miles to the north and south of us in
the old national and state parks, the groves of ancient giants still
stand. A few hundred acres of them here and there have been released by
the government, sold to wealthy, usually foreign interests, and logged.
And squatters have cut and burned a number of individual trees, as
usual, to build shelters and feed cooking fires, but the majority of the
protected ones, millennia old, resistant to disease, fire, and climate
change, still stand. If people let them alone, they will go on,
childless, anachronistic, but still alive, still reaching futilely
skyward.

**My father, perhaps because of his age, seems to have been a loving
pessimist. He saw little good in our future. According to his writing,
our greatness as a country, perhaps even the greatness of the human
species, was in the past. His greatest desire seems to have been to
protect my mother and later, to protect me---to somehow keep us safe.**

**My mother, on the other hand, was a somewhat reluctant optimist.
Greatness for her, for Earthseed, for humanity always seemed to run just
ahead of her. Only she saw it, but that was enough to entice her on,
seducing her as she seduced others.**

**She worked hard at seducing people. She did it first by adopting
vulnerable needy people, then by finding ways to make those people want
to be part of Earthseed. No matter how ridiculous Earthseed must have
seemed, with its starry Destiny, it offered immediate rewards. Here was
real community. Here was at least a semblance of security. Here was the
comfort of ritual and routine and the emotional satisfaction of
belonging to a "team" that stood together to meet challenge when
challenge came. And for families, here was a place to raise children, to
teach them basic skills that they might not learn elsewhere and to keep
them as safe as possible from the harsh, ugly lessons of the world
outside.**

**When I was in high school, I read the 1741 Jonathan Edwards sermon,
"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God." Its first few words sum up the
kinds of lessons so many children were forced to learn in the world
outside Acorn. Edwards said, "The God that holds you over the pit of
hell, much as one holds a spider, or some loathsome insect over the
fire, abhors you, and is dreadfully provoked; his wrath towards you
burns like fire; he looks upon you as worthy of nothing else, but to be
cast into the fire." You're worthless. God hates you. All you deserve is
pain and death. What a believable theology that would have been for the
children of the Pox. No wonder, some of them found comfort in my
mother's God. If it didn't love them, at least it offered them some
chance to live.**

**If my mother had created only Acorn, the refuge for the homeless and
the orphaned....If she had created Acorn, but not Earthseed, then I
think she would have been a wholly admirable person.**

[SUNDAY, OCTOBER]{.small} 24, 2032

Dan is much better. He's still limping, but he's healing fast. He sat
through Gathering today for the first time. We held it indoors at the
school because it's been raining---a good steady cold rain---for two
days.

Dan sat through a welcoming and a discussion that his family's truck had
helped to provoke. The welcoming was for Adela Ortiz's baby, Javier
Verdugo Ortiz. Javier was the child of a brutal highway gang rape, and
Adela, who came to us pregnant only seven months ago, had not known
whether she wanted us to welcome him, had not even known whether or not
she wanted to keep him. Then he was born and she said he looked like her
long-dead younger brother, and she loved him at once, and couldn't think
of giving him up and would we welcome him, please? Now we have.

Adela has no other family left, so several of us made little gifts for
him. I made her a pouch that she can use to carry the baby on her back.
Thanks to Natividad, who has carried each of her babies that way,
backpacking babies has become the custom for new mothers here at Acorn.

Adela chose Michael and Noriko to stand with her. They took their places
on either side of her as the baby slept in her arms, and we filed past,
each of us looking at Javier and giving him gentle, welcoming touches on
each tiny hand and the black-haired head. He has the full head of hair
of a much older child. Adela says her brother was that way too. She had
helped to take care of her brother when he was a baby and now she feels
very much that God has given him back to her. I know that when she talks
about God, she doesn't mean what I mean. I'm not sure that matters. If
she stays with us, obeys our rules, joins in our joys, sorrows, and
celebrations, works alongside us, it doesn't matter. And in the future,
when her son says "God," I think he will mean what I mean. These are the
words of welcoming:

***"Javier Verdugo Ortiz***

***We, your people***

***Welcome you.***

***We are Earthseed*.**

***You are Earthseed*---**

***One of many***

***One unique,***

***One small seed,***

***One great promise.***

***Tenacious of life,***

***Shaper of God,***

***Water,***

***Fire,***

***Sculptor,***

***Clay,***

***You are Earthseed!***

***And your Destiny,***

***The Destiny of Earthseed,***

***Is to take root***

***Among the stars."***

They're good words. Not good enough to welcome a child into the world
and into the community. No words are good enough to do that, and yet,
somehow, words are needed. Ceremony is needed. As I spoke the words, the
people sang them softly. Travis Douglas and Gray Mora have set several
Earthseed verses to music. Travis can write music. Gray can hear it
inside himself and then sing it to Travis.

When the words, the music, and the touching were over, when the Kardoses
had accepted Adela as their sister and Javier as their nephew and Adela
had accepted them, when all three had given their sworn promise before
the community, Javier woke up wanting to nurse and Adela had to go back
to her seat with him. Beautiful timing.

So many members of our community have come to us alone or with only
little children that it seems best for me to do what I can to create
family bonds that take in more than the usual godparent-godchild
relationship. All too often, back in my old neighborhood in Robledo,
that was no relationship at all. Aside from giving occasional gifts,
people did not take it seriously. I want it taken seriously here. I've
made that clear to everyone. No one has to take on the responsibility of
joining in this way to another family, but anyone who does take that
responsibility has made a real commitment. The family relationship is
not only with the new child, but with its parents as well. We are too
young a community for me to say for sure how well this will work in the
future, but people seem to accept it. We're used to depending on one
another.

Once the welcoming was over, we moved on to the weekly discussion. Our
Gatherings, aside from weddings, funerals, welcomings, or holiday
celebrations, are discussions. They're problem-solving sessions, they're
times of planning, healing, learning, creating, times of focusing, and
reshaping ourselves. They can cover anything at all to do with Earthseed
or Acorn, past, present, or future, and anyone can speak.

During the first Gathering of the month, I lead a
looking-back-looking-forward discussion to keep us aware of what we've
done and what we must do, taking in any necessary changes, and taking
advantage of any opportunities. And I encourage people to think about
how the things we do help us to sustain purposeful religious community.

This morning Travis Douglas wanted to talk about expanding our community
business, a subject dear to my own heart. First he read his chosen
Earthseed texts---verses that, like any good texts, could be used to
start any number of different discussions.

> *"Civilization is to groups what intelligence is to individuals.
> Civilization provides ways of combining the information, experience,
> and creativity of the many to achieve ongoing group adaptability."*

And then,

> *"Any Change may bear seeds of benefit.*
>
> *Seek them out.*
>
> *Any Change may bear seeds of harm. Beware.*
>
> *God is infinitely malleable.*
>
> *God is Change."*

"We have an opportunity that we have to take advantage of," Travis said.
"We have the truck, and we have no real competition. I've gone over the
truck, and in spite of the way it looks, it's in damned good shape. The
solar wings just drink sunlight---really efficient. If we recharge the
batteries during the day, we should save a bundle in fuel. For short
trips there isn't even any need to use anything but the batteries. We
have the best vehicle in the area. We can do minor professional hauling.
We can buy goods from our neighbors and sell them in the cities and
towns. People will be glad to sell us their stuff for a little less if
we're the ones who do the work of getting it to market. And we can
contract to grow crops for businesses in Eureka-Arcata, maybe down in
Garberville."

Several of us have talked about this off and on, but today was our first
Gathering on the subject since we got the truck. Travis, more than most
of us, wanted to risk becoming more involved with our neighbors. We
could contract with them to buy the specific handicrafts, tools, and
crops that they produce well. We know by now who's good at what, who's
dependable, and who's honest and sober at least most of the time.

Travis and I have already been asking around on our now more frequent
trips to Eureka to see which merchants might be interested in
contracting to buy specific produce from us.

Travis cleared his throat and spoke to the group again. "With the
truck," he said, "only our first truck if we're successful, we've got
the beginnings of a wholesale business. Then, instead of depending only
on what we can produce and instead of only bartering with near
neighbors, we can grow a business as well as a community and a movement.
It's important that we become a self-sustaining economic entity or we're
liable never to move out of the nineteenth century!"

Well put, but not all that well received. We say "God is Change," but
the truth is, we fear change as much as anyone does. We talk about
changes at Gathering to ease our fears, to desensitize ourselves and to
consider consequences.

"We're doing all right," Allie Gilchrist said. "Why should we take on
more risk? And why, when this guy Jarret is liable to win the election,
should we draw attention to ourselves?" She had already lost her infant
son and her sister. She had only her adopted son Justin, and she would
do almost anything to protect him.

Michael surprised me. "We could do it, I suppose," he said, and I waited
for the "but." There was bound to be one with Michael. He obliged. "But
she's right about Jarret. If he gets elected, the last thing we'll need
is higher visibility."

"Jarret is down in the polls!" Jorge said. "His people are scaring
everyone to death with their burning churches, burning people. He might
not win."

"Who the hell do they poll these days?" Michael asked, shaking his head.
And then, "We'd better keep an eye on Jarret anyway. Win or lose, he'll
still have plenty of followers who are eager to create scapegoats."

Harry spoke up. "We aren't invisible now," he said. "People in the
nearby towns know us, know what we are---or they think they do. I want
my kids to have a chance at decent lives. Maybe this wholesaling idea
will be the beginning of that chance."

Next to him, his wife Zahra nodded and said, "I'm for it too. We didn't
settle here just to grub in the ground and live in log huts. We can do
better."

"We might even improve things for ourselves with the neighbors," Travis
said, "if more people in the area know us, know that we can be trusted,
it might be a little harder for a rabble-rouser like Jarret or one of
his local clones to make trouble for us."

I doubted that that would prove true---at least not on a large scale. We
would meet more people, make more friends, and some of these would be
loyal. The rest...well, the best we could hope for from them would be
that they ignore us if we get into trouble. That might be the kindest
gesture they could manage---to turn their backs and not join the mob.
Others, whether we thought of them as friends or not, would be all too
willing to join the mob and to stomp us and rob us if stomping and
robbing became a test of courage or a test of loyalty to country,
religion, or race.

On the other hand, making more of the right kinds of friends couldn't
hurt us. We've already made some that I trust---near neighbors, a couple
of people in Prata, and a few more in Georgetown, the big squatter
settlement outside Eureka. And the only way to make more good friends is
to make more friends period.

Adela Ortiz spoke up in her quick, soft, little-girl voice. She's only
16. "What if people think we're cheating them?" she said. "People always
think that. You know, like you're trying to be nice to them and they
just think everybody's a liar and a thief but them."

I was sitting near her, so I answered. "People will think whatever they
like," I said. "It's our job to show by our behavior that we're not
thieves, and we're not fools. We've got a good reputation so far. People
know we don't steal. They know better than to steal from us. And they
know we're neighborly. In emergencies, we help out. Our school is open
to their kids for a little hard currency, and their kids are safe while
they're here." I shrugged. "We've made a good start."

"And you think this wholesaling business is the way for us to go?"
Grayson Mora asked.

I looked over at him with surprise. He sometimes manages to get through
a whole Gathering without saying anything. He isn't shy at all, but he's
quiet. He and his wife were slaves before they met. Each had lost family
members to the effects and neglects of slavery. Now between them they
have two girls and two boys. They're ferocious in guarding their
children, and suspicious of anything new that might affect those
children.

"I do," I said. I paused, glanced up at Travis who stood at the big
handsome oak podium that Allie had built. Then I continued. "I believe
we can do it as long as the truck holds up. You're our expert there,
Travis. You've said the truck is in good shape, but can we afford to
maintain it? What new, expensive part will it be needing soon?"

"By the time it needs anything expensive, we should be making more
money," he said. "As of now, even the tires are good, and that's
unusual." He leaned over the podium, looking confident and serious. "We
can do this," he said. "We should start small, study the possibilities,
and figure out how we should grow. If we do this right, we should be
able to buy another truck in a year or two. We're growing. We need to do
this."

Beside me, Bankole sighed. "If we're not careful," he said, "our size
and success will make us the castle on the hill---everyone's protector
in this area. I don't think that's wise."

I do think it's wise, but I didn't say so. Bankole still can't see this
place as anything more than a temporary stop on the way to a "real" home
in a "real" town---that is, an already established town. I don't know
how long it will take for him to see that what we're building here is as
real and at least as important as anything he's likely to find in a town
that's been around for a century or two.

I foresee a time when our settlement is not only "the castle on the
hill," but when most or all of our neighbors have joined us. Even if
they don't like every aspect of Earthseed, I hope they'll like enough of
it to recognize that they're better off with us than without us. I want
them as allies and as members, not just as "friends." And as we absorb
them, I also intend to either absorb some of the storekeeper,
restaurant, or hotel clients that we'll have---or I want us to open our
own stores, restaurants, and hotels. I definitely want to begin
Gathering Houses that are also schools in Eureka, Arcata, and some of
the larger nearby towns. I want us to grow into the cities and towns in
this natural, self-supporting way.

I don't know whether we can do all this, but I think we have to try. I
think this is what a real beginning for Earthseed looks like.

I don't know how to do it. That scares me to death sometimes---always
feeling driven to do something I don't know how to do. But I'm learning
as I go along. And I've learned that I have to be careful how I talk
about all this, even to Acorn. Bankole isn't the only one of us who
doesn't see the possibility of doing anything he hasn't seen done by
others. And...although Bankole would never say this, I suspect that
somewhere inside himself, he believes that large, important things are
done only by powerful people in high positions far away from here.
Therefore, what we do is, by definition, small and unimportant. This is
odd, because in other ways, Bankole has a healthy ego. He didn't let
self-doubt or the doubts of his family or the laughter of his friends
stop him from going to college, and then medical school, surviving by
way of a combination of scholarships, jobs, and huge debts. He began as
a quietly arrogant Black boy of no particular distinction, and he ended
as a physician.

But in a way, I suppose that's normal. I mean, it had been done before.
Bankole himself had been taken to a Black woman pediatrician when he was
a child.

What I'm trying to do isn't quite normal. It's been done. New belief
systems have been introduced. But there's no standard way of introducing
them---no way that can be depended on to work. What I'm trying to do is,
I'm afraid, a crazy, difficult, dangerous undertaking. Best to talk
about it only a little bit at a time.

Noriko, Michael's wife, spoke up. "I'm afraid for us to get involved in
this new business," she said, "but I think we have to do it. This is a
good community, but how long can it last, how long can it grow before we
begin to have trouble feeding ourselves?"

People nodded. Noriko has more courage than she gives herself credit
for. She can be shaking with fear, but she still does what she thinks
she should do.

"We can grow or we can wither," I agreed. "That's what Earthseed is
about on a larger scale, after all."

"I wish it weren't," Emery Mora said. "I wish we could just hide here
and stay out of everything else. I know we can't, but I wish....It's
been so good here." Before she escaped slavery, she'd had two young sons
taken from her and sold. And she's a sharer. She and Gray and his
daughter Doe and her daughter Tori and their sons Carlos and
Antonio---all sharers. No other family is so afflicted. No other family
has more reason to want to hide.

We talked on for a while, Travis listening as people protested, then
either answering their protests or letting others answer them. Then he
asked for a vote: Should we expand our business? The vote was "yes" with
everyone over 15 voting. Only Allie Gilchrist, Alan Faircloth, Ramiro
Peralta, and Ramiro's oldest daughter Pilar voted "no." Aubrey Dovetree,
who couldn't vote because she was not yet a member, made it clear that
she would have voted "no" if she could have.

"Remember what happened to us!" she said.

We all remembered. But we had no intention of trading in illegal goods.
We're farther from the highway than Dovetree was, and we couldn't refuse
this opportunity just because Dovetree had been hit.

We would expand our business, then. Travis would put together a team,
and the team would talk to our neighbors---those without cars or trucks
first---and talk to more merchants in the cities and towns. We need to
know what's possible now. We know we can sell more at street markets
because now with the truck we can go to more street markets. So even if
we don't manage to get contracts at first, we'll be able to sell what we
buy from our neighbors. We've begun.

When the Gathering was over, we shared a Gathering Day meal. We spread
ourselves around the two large rooms of the school for food, indoor
games, talk, and music. At the front of the room near the podium,
Dolores Figueroa Castro was planning to read a story to a group of small
children who would sit at her feet. Dolores is Lucio's niece, Marta's
daughter. She's only 12, but she likes reading to the younger kids, and
since she reads well and has a nice voice, the kids like to listen. For
the adults and older kids, we were to have an original play, written by
Emery Mora, of all people. She's too shy to act, but she loves to write
and she loves to watch plays. Lucio Figueroa has discovered that he
enjoys staging plays, shaping fictional worlds. Jorge and a few others
are hams and love acting in plays. Travis and Gray provide any needed
music. The rest of us enjoy watching. We all feed one another's hungers.

Dan Noyer came over to me as I helped myself to fried rabbit, baked
potato, a mix of steamed vegetables with a spicy sauce, and a little
goat cheese. There were also pine nut cookies, acorn bread, and sweet
potato pie. On Gathering Day, the rule is, we eat only what we've raised
and prepared. There was a time when that was something of a hardship. It
reminded us that we were not growing or raising as much as we should.
Now it's a pleasure. We're doing well.

"Can I sit with you?" Dan asked.

I said, "Sure," then had to fend off several other people who wanted me
to eat with them. Dan's expression made me think it was time for him and
me to have some version of the talk that I always seem to wind up having
with newcomers. I thought of it as the "What the hell is this Earthseed
stuff, and do I have to join?" talk.

Right on cue, Dan said, "The Balters say my sisters and I can stay here.
They say we don't have to join your cult if we don't want to."

"You don't have to join Earthseed," I said. "You and your sisters are
welcome to stay. If you decide to join us someday, we'll be glad to
welcome you."

"What do we have to do---just to stay, I mean?"

I smiled. "Finish healing first. When you're well enough, work with us.
Everyone works here, kids and adults. You'll help in the fields, help
with the animals, help maintain the school and its grounds, help do some
building. Building homes is a communal effort here. There are other
jobs---building furniture, making tools, trading at street markets,
scavenging. You'll be free to choose something you like. And you'll go
to school. Have you gone to school before?"

"My folks taught us."

I nodded. These days, most educated poor or middle-class people taught
their own children or did what people in my old neighborhood had
done---formed unofficial schools in someone's home. Only very small
towns still had anything like old-fashioned public schools. "You might
find," I said, "that you know some things well enough to teach them to
younger kids. One of the first duties of Earthseed is to learn and then
to teach."

"And this? This Gathering?"

"Yes, you'll come to Gathering every week."

"Will I get a vote?"

"No vote, but you'll get a share of the profit from the sale of the
crop, and from the other businesses if things work out. That's after
you've been here for a year. You won't have a decision-making role
unless you decide to join. If you do join, you'll get a larger share of
the profit and a vote."

"It isn't really religious---your service, I mean. You guys don't
believe in God or anything."

I turned to look at him. "Dan, of course we do."

He just stared at me in silent, obvious disbelief.

"We don't believe the way your parents did, perhaps, but we do believe."

"That God is Change?"

"Yes."

"I don't even know what that means."

"It means that Change is the one unavoidable, irresistible, ongoing
reality of the universe. To us, that makes it the most powerful reality,
and just another word for God."

"But...what can you do with a God like that? I mean...it isn't even a
person. It doesn't love you or protect you. It doesn't know anything.
What's the point?"

"The point is, it's the truth," I said. "It's a hard truth. Too hard for
some people to take, but that doesn't make it any less true." I put my
food down, got up, and went to one of our bookcases. There, I took down
one of our several copies of *Earthseed: The First Book of the Living*.
I self-published this first volume two years ago. Bankole had looked
over my text when it was finished, and said I should copyright and
publish for my own protection. At the time, that seemed unnecessary---a
ridiculous thing to do in a world gone mad. Later, I came to believe he
was right---for the future and for a reason in the present that Bankole
had not mentioned.

"Things will get back to normal someday," he had said to me. "You should
do this in the same way that we go on paying their taxes."

Things won't get back to what he calls normal. We'll settle into some
new norm someday---for a while. Whether that new norm will recognize our
tax paying or my copyright, I don't know. But there's a more immediate
advantage to be had here.

People are still impressed, even intimidated, by bound, official-looking
books. Verses, handwritten or printed out on sheets of paper just don't
grab them the way a book does. Even people who can't read are impressed
by books. The idea seems to be, "If it's in a book, maybe it's true," or
even, "If it's in a book, it must be true." I went back to Dan, opened
the book, and read to him,

*"Do not worship God*

*Inexorable God*

*Neither needs nor wants*

*Your worship.*

*Instead,*

*Acknowledge and attend God,*

*Learn from God,*

*With forethought and intelligence,*

*Imagination and industry,*

*Shape God.*

*When you must,*

*Yield to God.*

*Adapt and endure.*

*For you are Earthseed,*

*And God is Change."*

I paused, then said, "That's what we believe, Dan. That's what we strive
to do---part of what we strive to do, anyway."

Dan listened, frowning. "I'm still not sure what all that means."

"You'll learn more about it in school. We say education is the most
direct pathway to God. For now, it's enough to say that verse just means
that flattering or begging God isn't useful. Learn what God does. Learn
to shape that to your needs. Learn to use it, or at least, learn to
adapt to it so that you won't get squashed by it. That's useful."

"So you're saying praying doesn't work."

"Oh, no. Praying does work. Praying is a very effective way of talking
to *yourself*, of talking yourself into things, of focusing your
attention on whatever it is you want to do. It can give you a feeling of
control and help you to stretch yourself beyond what you thought were
your limits."

I paused, thinking of how well Dan had done just that when he tried to
rescue his parents. "It doesn't always work the way we want it to," I
said. "But it's always worth the effort."

"Even if when I pray, I ask God to help me?" he asked.

"Even so," I said. "You're the one your words reach and strengthen. You
can think of it as praying to that part of God that's within you."

He thought about that for a while, then looked at me as though he had a
big question, but hadn't yet decided how to ask it. He looked down at
the book.

"How do you know you're right?" he asked at last. "I mean, that guy who
wants to be President, that Jarret, he would call you all heathens or
pagans or something."

Indeed, he would. "Yes," I said. "He does seem to enjoy calling people
things like that. Once he's made everyone who isn't like him sound evil,
then he can blame them for problems he knows they didn't cause. That's
easier than trying to fix the problems."

"My dad says..." The boy stopped and swallowed. "My dad said Jarret's an
idiot."

"I agree with your dad."

"But how do you know you're right?" he insisted. "How do you know
Earthseed is true. Who says it's true?"

"You do, Dan." I let him chew on that for a while, then went on. "You
learn, you think, you question. You question us and you question
yourself. Then, if you find Earthseed to be true, you join us. You help
us teach others. You help others the way we've helped you and your
sisters." Another pause. "Spend some time reading this book. The verses
are short and they mean what they say, although that may not be all that
they mean. Read them and think about them. Then you can begin asking
questions."

"I've been reading;" he said. "Not this book, but other things. Nothing
to do but read while I could hardly move. The Balters gave me novels and
things. And...I've been thinking that I shouldn't be here, living soft,
eating good food, and reading books. I've been thinking that I ought to
be out, looking for my sisters Nina and Paula. I'm the oldest, and
they're lost. I'm the man of the family now. I should be looking for
them."

That was the most alarming thing he had said so far. "Dan, we have no
way of knowing---"

"Yeah. No one knows if they're alive or where they are or if they're
still together....I know. I keep thinking about all that. But they're my
sisters. Dad and Mom always told me to look out for them." He shook his
head. "Hell, I didn't even look out for Kassi and Mercy. If they hadn't
saved themselves, I guess we'd all be dead." He shoved his dinner away
in self-disgust. He had already eaten most of it. But because we were on
a bench rather than at a table, there was little room for shoving
things. His plate fell off onto the floor and broke.

He stared at it, tears in his eyes---tears that had nothing to do with
broken china.

I reached for his hand.

He flinched away, then looked up from the plate and stared at me through
his tears.

I took his hand again, and looked back at him. "We have friends in some
of the nearby towns," I said. "We've already left word with them. We're
offering a reward for the girls or for information that leads us to
them. If we can, we'll snatch them. If we have to, we'll buy them." I
sighed. "I can't promise anything, Dan, but we'll do what we can. And we
need you to help us. Travel with us to street markets, stores, and shops
in nearby communities. Help us to look for them."

He went on staring at me as though I might be lying, as though he could
find the truth in my face, if only he stared hard enough at it. "Why?
Why would you do that?"

I hesitated, then drew a deep breath and told him. "We've all lost
people," I said. "Everyone here has lost members of their families to
fire, to murder, to raids....I had a father, a stepmother, and four
younger brothers. All dead. All. When we can save life...we do. We
couldn't stand it any other way."

And still, he stared at me. But now he was shaking. He made me think of
a crystal thing, vibrating to sound, about to shatter. I pulled him to
me, held him, this big child, taller than me. I felt his tears, wet on
my shoulder, then felt his arms go around me, hugging back, still
shaking, silent, desperate, hanging on.

From EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

**Beware:**

**At war**

**Or at peace,**

**More people die**

**Of unenlightened self-interest**

**Than of any other disease.**

**T[HE SELECTIONS I'VE OFFERED]{.small} from my mother's journal make it
clear that in spite of her near nineteenth-century existence she paid
attention to the wider world. Politics and war mattered very much.
Science and technology mattered. Fashions in crime and drug use and in
racial, ethnic, religious, and class tolerance mattered. She did see
these as fashions, by the way---as behaviors that went in and out of
favor for reasons that ran the gamut from the practical to the emotional
to the biological. Human competitiveness and territoriality were often
at the root of particularly horrible fashions in oppression. We human
beings seem always to have found it comforting to have someone to took
down on---a bottom level of fellow creatures who are very vulnerable,
but who can somehow be blamed and punished for all or any troubles. We
need this lowest class as much as we need equals to team with and to
compete against and superiors to look to for direction and help.**

**My mother was always noticing and mentioning things like that.
Sometimes she managed to work her observations into Earthseed verses. In
November of 2032 she had bigger reasons than usual to pay attention to
the world outside.**

[SUNDAY, NOVEMBER]{.small} 7, 2032

News.

Tucked away at Acorn as we are, we have to make a special effort to get
news from outside---real news, I mean, not rumors, and not the "news
bullets" that purport to tell us all who we need to know in flashy
pictures and quick, witty, verbal one-two punches. Twenty-five or thirty
words are supposed to be enough in a news bullet to explain either a war
or an unusual set of Christmas lights. Bullets are cheap and full of big
dramatic pictures. Some bullets are true virtuals that allow people to
experience---safely---hurricanes, epidemics, fires, and mass murder.
Hell of a kick.

Well-made news disks, on the other hand, or good satellite news services
cost more. Gray and Emery Mora and one or two others say news bullets
are enough. They say detailed news doesn't matter. Since we can't change
the stupid, greedy, vicious things that powerful people do, they think
we should try to ignore them. No matter how many times we're forced to
admit we can't really hide, some of us still find ways to try.

Well, we can't hide. So it's best to pay attention to what goes on. The
more we know, the better able we'll be to survive. So we subscribe to a
good phone news service and now and then we buy detailed world-news
disks. The whole business makes me long for free broadcast radio like
the kind we had when I was a kid, but that's almost nonexistent in this
area. We listen to what little is left when we go into one of the larger
towns. We can hear more now because the truck's radio picks up more than
our little pocket radios can.

So here are some of the most significant news items of the past week. We
listened to some of them on a new Worldisk today after Gathering.

Alaska is still claiming to be an independent nation, and it seems to
have gotten into an even closer more formal alliance with Canada and
Russia---northerners sticking together I suppose. Bankole shrugged when
he heard that and shook his head. "Why not?" he said. "They've got all
the money."

Thanks to climate change, they do have most of it. The climate is still
changing, warming. It's supposed to settle at a new stable state
someday. Until then, we'll go on getting a lot of violent erratic
weather around the world. Sea level is still rising and chewing away at
low-lying coastal areas like the sand dunes that used to protect
Humboldt Bay and Arcata Bay just north of us. Half the crops in the
Midwest and South are still withering from the heat, drowning in floods,
or being torn to pieces by winds, so food prices are still high. The
warming has made tropical diseases like malaria and dengue normal parts
of life in the warm, wet Gulf Coast and southern Atlantic coast states.
But people are beginning to adapt. There's less cholera, for instance,
and less hepatitis. There are fewer of all the diseases that result from
bad sanitation, spoiled food, or malnutrition. People boil the water
they drink in cities where there's a problem and in squatter settlements
with their open sewers---ditches. There are more gardens, and
old-fashioned skills in food preservation are being revived. People
barter for goods and services where cash is rare. They use hand tools
and draft animals where there is no money for fuel or no power equipment
left. Life is getting better, but that won't stop a war if politicians
and business people decide it's to their advantage to have one.

There are plenty of wars going on around the world now.

Kenya and Tanzania are fighting. I haven't yet heard why. Bolivia and
Peru are having another border dispute. Pakistan and Afghanistan have
joined forces in a religious war against India. One part of Spain is
fighting against another. Greece and Turkey are on the edge of war, and
Egypt and Libya are slaughtering one another. China, like Spain, is
tearing at itself. War is very popular these days.

I suppose we should be grateful that there hasn't been another "nuclear
exchange." The one three years ago between Iran and Iraq scared the hell
out of everyone. After it happened, there must have been peace all over
the world for maybe three months. People who had hated one another for
generations found ways to talk peace. But insult by insult, expediency
by expediency, cease-fire violation by cease-fire violation, most of the
peace talks broke down. It's always been much easier to make war than to
make peace.

Back in this country, in Dallas, Texas, some fool of a rich boy went
adventuring among the free poor of a big squatter settlement. He wound
up wearing the latest in electronic convict control devices---also known
as slave collars, dog collars, and choke chains. And with the collar to
encourage him, he learned to make himself useful to a local pimp. I've
heard that the new collars are damned sophisticated. The old ones---worn
more often as belts---could only cause pain. They delivered shocks and
sometimes damaged or killed people. The new collars don't kill, and they
can be worn for months or years at a time and used often to deliver
punishment. They're programmed to resist being removed or destroyed by
delivering jolts of pain severe enough to cause unconsciousness. I've
heard that some collars can also give cheap, delicious rewards of
pleasure for good behavior by encouraging changes in brain
chemistry---stimulating the wearer to produce endorphins. I don't know
whether that's true, but if it is, the whole business sounds a little
like being a sharer---except that instead of sharing what other people
feel, the wearer feels whatever the person holding the control unit
wants him to feel. This could initiate a whole new level of slavery.
After a while, needing the pleasure, fearing the pain, and always being
desperate to please the master could become a person's whole life. I've
heard that some collared people kill themselves, not because they can't
stand the pain, but because they can't stand the degree of slavishness
to which they find themselves descending.

The Texas boy's father spent a lot of money. He hired private cops---the
kind who'll do anything if you pay them enough---and they sliced through
the squatter camp as though it were a ripe melon until they found the
boy. And with that, bingo! Slavery was discovered in Texas in 2032.
Innocent people---not criminals or indigents---were being held against
their wills and used for immoral purposes! How about that! What I'd like
to see is a state of the union where slavery isn't being practiced.

Here's another news item. On the planet Mars, living, multicellular
organisms have been discovered...sort of. They're very small and very
strange inside, although outside they look like tiny slugs...some of the
time. They live at least four meters down in certain polar rock
formations, and they're not exactly animals. They're a little like
Terrestrial slime molds. And, like slime molds, they go through
independent single-celled stages during which they eat their way through
the rocks, multiplying by dividing, resembling little antifreeze-filled
amoeba. When they've exhausted the food supply in their immediate
neighborhoods, they unite into sluglike multicellular masses to travel
to new sites where the minerals they ingest are available. They don't
reproduce in their slug form as Terrestrial slime molds do. They seem to
need the slug form only to produce enough of their corrosive antifreeze
solution to enable them to migrate through rock to a fresh supply of
food. They make soil in two ways. They eat minerals, pass these through
their bodies, and shed a dust so fine and so slippery that, like
graphite, it can work as a kind of lubricant. And they ooze through the
rocks in their slug form, their corrosive slime dissolving trails,
cracks, and making more dust.

*These creatures are living Martians!* So far, though, all the specimens
captured and examined at Leal Station died soon after being taken from
their cold, rocky home. For that reason and others, they are both a
great discovery and a great sadness. They are the last discoveries that
will be made by scientists working for the U.S. Government.

President Donner has sold the last of our Mars installations to a
Euro-Japanese company, in fulfillment of one of his earliest campaign
promises. The idea is that all nonmilitary space travel, manned and
unmanned, should be privatized. "If it's worth doing at all," Donner
said, "it should be done for profit, and not as a burden on the
taxpayers." As though profit could be counted only as immediate
financial gain. I was born in 2009, and for as long as I can remember,
I've heard people complaining about the space program as a waste of
money, and even as one of the reasons for the country's deterioration.

Ridiculous! There is so much to be learned from space itself and from
the nearby worlds! And now we've found living extraterrestrials, and
we're going to quit. I suppose that if the Martian "slime molds" can be
used for something---mining, perhaps, or chemistry---then they'll be
protected, cultivated, bred to be even more useful. But if they prove to
be of no particular use, they'll be left to survive or not as best they
can with whatever impediments the company sees fit to put in their
paths. If they're unlucky enough to be bad for business in some
way---say they develop a taste for some of the company's building
materials---they'll be lucky to survive at all. I doubt that Terrestrial
environmental laws will protect them. Those laws don't even really
protect plant and animal species here on Earth. And who would enforce
such laws on Mars?

And yet, somehow, I'm glad our installations have been sold and not just
abandoned. Selling them was bad, but it was the lesser evil. Most people
wouldn't have minded seeing them abandoned. They say we have no business
wasting time or money in space when there are so many people suffering
here on Earth, here in America. I wonder, though, where the money
received in exchange for the installations has gone. I haven't noticed
any new government education or jobs programs. There's been no
government help for the homeless, the sick, the hungry. Squatter
settlements are as big and as nasty as ever. As a country, we've given
up our birthright for even less than bread and pottage. We've given it
up for nothing---although I'm sure some people somewhere are richer now.

Consider, though: a brand-new form of life has been discovered on Mars,
and it got less time on the news disk than the runaway Texas boy. We're
becoming more and more isolated as a people. We're sliding into
undirected negative change, and what's worse, we're getting used to it.
All too often, we shape ourselves and our futures in such stupid ways.

More news. Scientists in Australia have managed to bring a human infant
to term in an artificial womb. The child was conceived in a petri dish.
Nine months later, it was taken, alive and healthy, from the last in a
series of complex, computer-controlled containers. The child is the
normal son of parents who could not have conceived or borne a child
without a great deal of medical help.

Reporters are already calling the womb containers "eggs," and there's
some foolish popular argument over whether a "hatched" person is as
human as a "normally born" person. There are ministers and priests
arguing that this tampering with human reproduction is wrong, of course.
I doubt that they'll have much to worry about for a while. The whole
process is still experimental and would be available only to the very
rich if it were being marketed to anyone---which it isn't, yet. I wonder
whether it will catch on at all in this world where so many poor women
are willing to serve as surrogate mothers, carrying to term the child of
wealthier people even when the wealthy people are able to have a child
in the normal way. If you're rich, you can have a surrogate for not much
more than the price of feeding and housing her for nine months. If she's
smart and you're generous, you might also wind up agreeing to feed,
house, and help educate her children. And you might give her husband a
job. Channa Ryan's mother did this kind of work. According to Channa,
her mother bore 13 surrogate children, none of them genetically related
to her. Her marriage didn't survive, but her two genetic daughters were
given a chance to learn to read and write, cook, garden, and sew. That
isn't enough to know in this world, of course, but it's more than most
poor people learn.

It will be a long while---years, decades perhaps---before human
surrogates are replaced by computerized eggs. Consider, though: eggs
combined with cloning technology (another toy of the rich) would give
men the ability to have a child without the genetic or the gestational
help of a woman. Such men would still need a woman's ovum, stripped of
its genetic contents, but that would be all. If the idea caught on, they
might be willing to use the ovum of some animal species.

And, of course, women will be free to do without men completely, since
women can provide their own ova. I wonder what this will mean for
humanity in the future. Radical change or just one more option among the
many?

I can see artificial wombs being useful when we travel into extrasolar
space---useful for gestating our first animals once they're transported
as frozen embryos and useful for gestating children if the
nonreproductive work of women settlers is needed to keep the colony
going. In that way, perhaps the eggs may be good for us---for
Earthseed---in the long run. But what they'll do to human societies in
the meantime, I wonder.

I've saved the worst news item for last. The election was on Tuesday,
November 2. Jarret won. When Bankole heard the news, he said, "May God
have mercy on our souls." I find that I'm more worried about our bodies.
Before the election I told myself that people had more sense than to
elect a man whose supporters burn people alive as "witches," and torch
the churches and homes of people they don't like.

We all voted---all of us who were old enough---and most of us voted for
Vice President Edward Jay Smith. None of us wanted an empty man like
Smith in the White House, but even a man without an idea in his head is
better than a man who means to lash us all back to his particular God
the way Jesus lashed the money changers out of the temple. He used that
analogy more than once.

Here are some of the things that Jarret said back when he was shouting
from his own Church of Christian America pulpit. I have copies of
several of his sermons on disk.

"There was a time, Christian Americans, when our country ruled the
world," he said. "America was God's country and we were God's people and
God took care of his own. Now look at us. Who are we? What are we? What
foul, seething, corrupt heathen concoction have we become?

"Are we Christian? Are we? Can our country be just a little bit
Christian and a little bit Buddhist, maybe? How about a little bit
Christian and a little bit Hindu? Or maybe a country can be a little bit
Christian and a little bit Jewish? How about a little bit Christian and
a little bit Moslem? Or perhaps we can be a little bit Christian and a
little bit pagan cultist?"

And then he thundered, "We are God's people, or we are filth! We are
God's people, or we are nothing! We are God's people! God's people!

"Oh my God, my God, why have we forsaken thee?

"Why have we allowed ourselves to be seduced and betrayed by these
allies of Satan, these heathen purveyors of false and unchristian
doctrines? These people...these pagans are not only wrong. They're
dangerous. They're as destructive as bullets, as contagious as plagues,
as poisonous as snakes to the society they infest. They kill us,
Christian American brothers and sisters. They kill us! They rouse the
righteous anger of God against us for our misguided generosity to them.
They are the natural destroyers of our country. They are lovers of
Satan, seducers of our children, rapists of our women, drug sellers,
usurers, thieves, and murderers!

"And in the face of all that, what are we to them? Shall we live with
them? Shall we let them continue to drag our country down into hell?
Think! What do we do to weeds, to viruses, to parasitic worms, to
cancers? What must we do to protect ourselves and our children? What can
we do to regain our stolen nation?"

Nasty. Very nasty. Jarret was the junior senator from Texas when he
preached the sermon that contained those lines. He never answered the
questions he asked. He left that to his listeners. And yet he says he's
against the witch burnings.

His speeches during the campaign have been somewhat less inflammatory
than his sermons. He's had to distance himself from the worst of his
followers. But he still knows how to rouse his rabble, how to reach out
to poor people, and sic them on other poor people. How much of this
nonsense does he believe, I wonder, and how much does he say just
because he knows the value of dividing in order to conquer and to rule?

Well, now he's conquered. In January of next year, he'll be sworn in,
and he'll rule. Then, I suppose we'll see just how much of his own
propaganda he believes.

Another, happier, more local event happened here at Acorn yesterday.
Lucio Figueroa, Zahra Balter, and Jeff King came in with a huge load of
books for our library. Some look almost new. Others are old and worn,
but they've all been protected from the weather, from water, and from
fire. There are textbooks, up to graduate level in several subjects,
specialized dictionaries, a set of encyclopedias---2001 edition---books
of history, how-to books, and dozens of novels. Jeff King ran across the
books being all but given away at a street market in Arcata.

"Someone was clearing out a room so that relatives could move into it,"
he told me. "The owner of the books had died. He was considered the
family eccentric, and no one else in the household shared his enthusiasm
for reading big, bulky books made of paper. I didn't think you'd mind my
buying them for the school."

"Mind?" I said. "Of course not!"

"Lucio said he wasn't sure we should spend the money, but Zahra said you
were crazy for more books. I figured she'd know."

I grinned. "She knows. I thought everyone knew."

There were fifteen boxes of books. We took them into the school, and
today we recovered as best we could from the stuff on the Worldisk by
looking through the books and shelving them. We read bits of this and
that to one another. People got excited and interested, and everyone
carried away a book or two to read. After hearing the news, we all
needed to read something that wasn't depressing.

I wound up with a couple of books on drawing. I haven't tried to draw
anything since I was seven or eight. Now, all of a sudden, I find myself
interested in learning to draw, learning to draw well---if I can. I want
to learn something new and unrelated to any of our troubles.

[SUNDAY, NOVEMBER]{.small} 14, 2032

I'm pregnant!

No surrogates, no computerized eggs, no drugs. Bankole and I did it the
good old-fashioned way---at last!

It's crazy that it should happen now, just when America has elected a
wild man to lead it. Bankole and I began trying as soon as we could see
that we were going to survive here at Acorn. Bankole's first wife
couldn't have children. As a young woman back in the 1990s, she was in a
serious car accident and wound up with a hysterectomy, among other
things. Bankole claimed he never minded. He said the world was going to
hell just as fast as it could, and it would be an act of cruelty to
bring a child into it. They talked about adopting, but never did.

Now he's going to be a father, and in spite of all his talk, he's almost
jumping up and down---that is, whenever he isn't being scared to death.
He's talking about moving into an established town again. He hadn't said
anything about that since right after we got the truck, but now the
subject is back, and he's serious. He wants to protect me. I realize
that. I suppose I should be glad he feels that way, but I wish he would
show his protective feelings in another way.

"You're a kid yourself," he said to me. "You don't have the sense to be
afraid."

I can't seem to get angry with him for saying things like that. He says
them, then he thinks for a moment, and if he doesn't watch himself, he
begins to grin like a boy. Then he remembers his fears and looks
panicked. Poor man.

[SUNDAY, DECEMBER]{.small} 5, 2032

Spokesmen for Christian America have announced that the Church will be
opening homeless shelters and children's homes---orphanages---in several
states, including California, Oregon, and Washington. This is just a
beginning, they say. They hope in time to "extend a helping hand to the
people of every state in the union, including Alaska." I heard this on a
newsdisk that Mike Kardos bought at a Garberville street market
yesterday. Time to begin to clean up the Christian America image, I
suppose. I just hope the California shelters and orphanages will be put
where they're most needed---down around San Diego, Los Angeles, and San
Francisco. I don't want them up here. Christian America is made up of
scary people, and I find it impossible to believe that they intend only
to do good and to help others.

[FRIDAY, DECEMBER]{.small} 17, 2032

Today I found my brother Marcus.

This is impossible, I know, but I found him. He's sick, fearful,
confused, and angry---but he's alive!

I found him in Eureka, California, although five years ago, down in
Robledo, he died.

I don't know what to say about this. I don't know how to deal with it.
Writing about it helps. Somehow, writing always helps.

Before dawn this morning, five of us drove into Eureka. Bankole needed
medical supplies and we had a couple of deliveries of winter vegetables
and fruit to make to small, independent stores who have already begun to
buy our produce. After that, we had a special errand.

Bankole hadn't wanted me to come. He worries about me more than ever
now, and he's always after me to move to an established town. We could
have a nice little house and he could be town doctor. We could live nice
empty little antique lives, and I could forget I've spent the past five
years struggling to establish Acorn as the beginning of Earthseed. Now
that we've got the truck, traveling is a lot less dangerous than it used
to be, but my Bankole is more worried than ever.

And, to tell the truth, there are still things to worry about. We've all
been looking over our shoulders since Dovetree. But we've got to live.
We've got work to do.

"So Acorn is safe now?" I said to Bankole. "I'll be safe if I stay
there?"

"Safer than you are traveling all over the county," he muttered, but he
knew me well enough to let it go. At least he would be along to keep an
eye on me.

Dan Noyer would also be along because our special errand concerned him.
On our way home we were going to meet with a man who had contacted us
through friends in Georgetown, claiming that he had one of Dan's younger
sisters, and that he would sell her to us. The man was a pimp, of
course---"a livestock man, specializing in lamb and chicken" as one of
the euphemisms went. That is, a man who puts slave collars on little
children and rents their bodies to other grown men. I hate the idea of
having anything to do with a slug like that, but he was exactly the kind
of walking filth who would have Nina and Paula Noyer.

I had asked Travis and Natividad Douglas to come along with us, to ride
shotgun, and in Travis's case, to fix the truck if anything went wrong
with it. I've trusted them both more than once with my life. I trust
their judgment and their ability to fight. I felt a need to have people
like that behind me when I was dealing with a slaver.

We made our deliveries to the two independent markets early, as we had
promised---produce from our fields and from what was left of Dovetree's
huge kitchen garden and small grove of fruit trees. The Dovetree truck
and farm tractor had both been stolen during the raid that destroyed
Dovetree. The houses and outbuildings had been torched along with the
stills and fields. But a number of fruit trees and garden crops
survived. Since the five surviving Dovetrees have decided to stay with
us---to join us as members of Earthseed once their required probationary
year has ended---we've felt free to take what we could from the
property. The two Dovetree women have relatives elsewhere in the
mountains, but they don't much like them, and they don't want to be
squeezed into crowded houses with them. They do get along with us, and
they know that while they're crowded now, they will have their own cabin
by the time they're Welcomed as members.

Of course, they could go back and live on their own land. But two women
and three children wouldn't survive on their own. They wouldn't survive
alone even in a place as hidden and protected as Acorn. Trying to live
right off the highway at Dovetree, they would be enslaved or killed in
no time. Any home or farm that can be seen from the highway is bound to
be tempting to the desperate and the opportunistic, and now the
fanatical. Dovetree as it was survived because the family was large,
well armed, and had a reputation for toughness. That worked until a
small, determined army came along. The attackers really were Jarret
loyalists, by the way. They came from the Eureka-Arcata area, from the
new Christian America churches that have sprung up there. They have no
government-sanctioned authority, but they believe God is on their side,
and the cleansing work they do is God's work. Somehow, this kind of
thing doesn't tend to make it to the news nets or disks. I've picked it
up by talking to people. I know a few good sources of local news.

Bankole bought his supplies next. They're the most expensive things we
buy, but they're also the most necessary. We are, as Bankole says, a
healthy, young community, but the world around us isn't healthy. Thanks
to malnutrition, climate change, poverty, and ignorance, a lot of old
diseases are back, and some of them are contagious. There was an
outbreak of whooping cough in the Bay Area last winter, and it came up
the highway as far north as Ukiah down in Mendocino County. Why it
stopped there, I don't know. And there was rabies last summer. Several
people in squatter camps were bitten by rabid dogs or rats. They died of
it, and a couple of teenagers were shot because they pretended to have
rabies just to scare people. Whatever money it costs to keep us healthy,
it's worth it.

When our business in Eureka was finished, we went to meet the slaver at
the place he and I had agreed on, just south and east of Eureka in
Georgetown. The squatter settlement called Georgetown extends well back
from the highway in coastal hills. The place is a human-made desert,
dusty when the weather is dry, muddy when it rains, almost treeless,
plantless, filled with the poorest of the poor and their open sewers,
their malnutrition, their drugs, crime, and disease. Bankole says it was
once a beautiful area of farms, trees, and hills. That must have been a
long time ago. The settlement is called Georgetown because the most
permanent-looking thing in it is a cluster of shabby-looking redwood
buildings. They're on a flattened hilltop and can be seen from just
about everywhere in the settlement. There's a store, a café, a games
hall, bar, a hotel, a fuel station, and a repair shop where tools, guns,
and vehicles of all kinds might be restored to usefulness. The whole
complex is called George's, and is run by a huge family surnamed George.
At the café, George's has a lot of rentable cubbyhole mailboxes where
packages and paper messages can be left, and there's a big bank of pay
phones where, for a serious fee, you can access almost any network,
service, group, or individual. This service in particular has made the
place a combination message center, meeting place, and Old West saloon.
It's natural to arrange to meet people there to transact business of all
kinds. Elroy George and his sons, his sons-in-law, his brothers, and his
brothers' sons see to it that people behave themselves. The Georges are
a formidable tribe. They stick together, and people respect them. Their
prices are high, but they're honest. You get what you pay for with the
Georges. Sad to say some of the things that get paid for in the café or
elsewhere at the complex are slaves and drugs. The Georges aren't
slavers, but they've been known to handle drugs. I wish that weren't so,
but it is. I just hope they don't go the way of the Dovetrees. They're
stronger and more entrenched, and better connected politically than the
Dovetrees, but who knows? Now that Jarret has been elected, who knows?

Dolores Ramos George, the matriarch of the tribe, runs the store and the
café and she knows everyone. She's got a reputation for being a hard,
mean woman, but as far as I'm concerned, she's just a realist. She
speaks her mind. I like her. She's one of the people with whom I left
word about the Noyer girls. When she heard the story, she just shook her
head. "Not a chance," she said. "Why didn't they keep a watch? Some
parents got no sense at all."

"I know," I said. "But I have to do what I can---for the sake of the
other three kids."

"Yeah." She shrugged. "I'll tell people. It won't do no good."

But now it looked as though it had done some good. And in thanks, I had
brought Dolores a basket of big navel oranges, a basket of lemons, and a
basket of persimmons. If we found one or both of the Noyer girls as a
result of her spreading the word, I would owe her a percentage of the
reward---a kind of finder's fee. But it seemed wise to make sure she
came out ahead, no matter what.

"Beautiful, beautiful fruit," she said, smiling as she looked at it and
handled it. She was a stout, old-looking 53, but the smile took years
off her. "Around here, if you don't guard a fruit tree and shoot a
couple of people to prove you mean it, they'll tear off all the fruit,
then cut down the tree for firewood. I won't let my boys kill people to
save trees and plants, but I really miss oranges and grapes and things."

She called some of her young grandchildren to come and take the fruit
into the house. I saw the way the kids were looking at everything, so I
warned them not to eat the persimmons until they were soft to the touch.
I cut one of the hard ones up and let each child have a taste of it so
they would all know just how awful something so pretty could taste
before it was ripe. Otherwise, they would have ruined several pieces of
fruit as they tried to find a tasty, ripe persimmon. Just yesterday, I
caught the Dovetree kids doing that back at Acorn. Dolores just watched
and smiled. Anyone who was nice to her grandkids could be her friend for
life---as long as they didn't cross the rest of her family.

"Come on," she said to me. "The shit pile that you want to talk with is
stinkin' up the café. Is this the boy?" She looked up at Dan, seeming to
notice him for the first time. "Your sister?" she asked him.

Dan nodded, solemn and silent.

"I hope she's the right girl," she said. Then she glanced at me, looked
me up and down. She smiled again. "So you're finally starting a family.
It's about time! I was 16 when I had my first."

I wasn't surprised. I'm only two months along, and not showing at all
yet. But she would notice, somehow. No matter how distracted and
grandmotherly she can seem when she wants to, she doesn't miss much.

We left Natividad in the housetruck, on watch. There are some very
efficient thieves hanging around Georgetown. Trucks need guarding.
Travis and Bankole went into the café with Dan and me, but Dan and the
two men took a table together off to one side to back me up in case
anything unexpected happened between the slaver and me. People didn't
start trouble inside George's Café if they were sensible, but you never
knew when you were dealing with fools.

Dolores directed us to a tall, lean, ugly man dressed completely in
black, and working hard to look contemptuous of the world in general and
George's Café in particular. He wore a kind of permanent sneer.

He sat alone as we had agreed, so I went over to him alone and
introduced myself. I didn't like his dry, papery voice or his tan,
almost yellow eyes. He used them to try to stare me down. Even his smell
repelled me. He wore some aftershave or cologne that gave him a heavy,
nasty, sweet scent. Honest sweat would have been less offensive. He was
bald, clean-shaved, beak-nosed, and so neutral-colored that he could
have been a pale-skinned Black man, a Latino, or a dark-skinned White.
He wore, aside from his black pants and shirt, an impressive pair of
black leather boots---no expense spared---and a wide heavy leather belt
decorated with what I first thought were jewels. It took me a moment to
realize that this was a control belt---the kind of thing you use when
you're moving around a lot and controlling several people through slave
collars. I had never seen one before, but I'd heard descriptions of
them.

Hateful bastard.

"Cougar," he said.

Crock of shit, I thought. But I said, "Olamina."

"The girl's outside with some friends of mine."

"Let's go see her."

We walked out of the café together, followed by my friends and his. Two
guys sitting at the table off to his right got up when he did. It was
all a ridiculous dance.

Outside, near the big, mutilated, dead stump of a redwood tree, several
kids waited, guarded by two more men. The kids, to my surprise, looked
like kids. They were not made up to look older or, for that matter,
younger. The boys---one looked no older than 10---wore clean jeans and
short-sleeved shirts. Three of the girls wore skirts and blouses, and
three wore shorts and T-shirts. All the jeans were a little too tight,
and the skirts were a little too short, but none were really worse than
things free kids of the same ages wore.

The slaves were clean and they looked alert and wary. None of them
looked sick or beaten, but they all kept an eye on Cougar. They looked
at him as he emerged from the café, then looked away so that they could
watch him without seeming to. They weren't really good at this yet, so I
couldn't help noticing. I looked around at Dan, who had followed us out
with Bankole and Travis. Dan looked at the slave kids, stopped for a
second as his gaze swept over the older girls, then shook his head.

"None of them are her," he said. "She's not here!"

"Hold on," Cougar said. He tapped his belt and four more kids came
around the great trunk of the tree---two boys and two girls. These were
a little older---mid-to-late teens. They were beautiful kids---the most
beautiful I had ever seen. I found myself staring at one of them.

Somewhere behind me, Dan was whimpering, "No, no, she's still not here!
Why did you say she was here? She's not!" He sounded much younger than
his 15 years.

And I heard Bankole talking to him, trying to calm him, but I stood
frozen, staring at one of the boys---a young man, really. The young man
stared back at me then looked away. Perhaps he had not recognized me. On
the other hand, perhaps he was warning me. I was late taking the
warning.

"Like that one, do you?" Cougar purred.

Shit.

"He's one of my best. Young and strong. Take him instead of a girl."

I made myself look at the girls. One of them did look like the
description we had given out of Dan's sisters: small, dark-haired,
pretty, 12 and 13 years old. Nina had a scar just at the hairline where
she had been burned when she was four and she and Paula and Dan had
found some matches to play with. Some of her hair had caught fire. Paula
had a mole---she called it a beauty mark---on the left side of her face
near her nose. The girl that Cougar hoped we would buy did have a scar
just at the hairline like Nina. She even resembled little Mercy Noyer
quite a bit. Same heart-shaped face.

"Did she say she was Nina Noyer?" I asked Cougar.

He grinned. "Can't talk," he said. "Can't write either. Best kind of
female. She must have said something bad to somebody, though, back when
she could talk. Because before I bought her, somebody cut her tongue
off."

I didn't let myself react, but there was no way I could avoid thinking
of our May back at Acorn. We still don't know whose work this tongue
cutting is, but we know that some Christian America types would be happy
to silence all women. Jarret preached that woman was to be treasured,
honored, and protected, but that for her own sake, she must be silent
and obey the will of her husband, father, brother, or adult son since
they understood the world as she did not. Was that it? The woman could
be silent or she could be silenced? Or was it simpler than that---some
pimp in the area just liked cutting out women's tongues? I didn't
believe Cougar had done it. There was nothing about his body language
that said he was lying or being evasive. That might just mean he was a
very good liar, but I didn't think so. It seemed to me that he was
telling the truth because he didn't care. He didn't give a damn who had
cut the girl or why. I did. I couldn't help it. How much more of this
kind of mutilation would we be seeing?

The beautiful young man moved his feet in a restless, noisy way,
dragging my attention back to him. Not that I was in any danger of
forgetting him. And he was the one I had to buy now.

"How much for him?" I asked. It was too late to pretend I wasn't
interested. I had all I could do to just keep functioning---speaking
sensible words in normal tones of voice, pretend that the impossible was
not in the process of happening.

"Buying, are we?" asked Cougar, smirking.

I turned to face him. "I came here to buy," I said. In fact, I would
chance making an enemy of the Georges and kill Cougar if I had to. I
would not leave my brother in this man's hands. The thought that I had
to leave any of these kids in his hands was sickening.

"I hope you can afford him," Cougar said. "Like I told you, he's one of
my best."

I haven't had to do much haggling in my life, but something occurred to
me as Cougar and I began. "He looks like one of your oldest," I said. My
brother Marcus would be almost 20 now. How old did one of Cougar's
child-slaves have to be before he was too old?

"He's 17!" Cougar lied.

I laughed and told a lie of my own. "Maybe five or six years ago he was
17. Good god, man, I'm not blind! He's great-looking, but he's no kid."
It amazed me that I could lie and laugh and behave as though nothing
unusual were happening when my long-dead brother stood alive and well
just a few meters away.

To my further amazement, we haggled for over an hour. It seemed to me to
be the right thing to do. Cougar was in no hurry, and I took my cue from
him. He even seemed to be enjoying himself some of the time. Everyone
else sat around on the ground, waiting, and looking bored or confused
and angry. My people were the confused, angry ones. Dan in particular
looked first disbelieving, then disgusted, then furious. But he followed
the example of the two men. He kept quiet. He sat staring at the ground,
his face expressionless. Travis watched me, then looked from me to
Bankole, trying to figure out what was going on. But he wouldn't ask in
front of Cougar. Bankole maintained a perfect poker face. Later, the
three of them would have a lot to say to me. But not now.

And Cougar did want to get rid of Marcus. Maybe it was Marcus's age,
maybe something else, but I couldn't miss that veiled eagerness of his.
What he said just didn't jibe with his body language. I think being a
sharer makes me extra sensitive to body language. Most of the time, this
is a disadvantage. It forces me to feel things that I don't want to
feel. Psychotics and competent actors can cause me a lot of trouble.
This time, though, my sensitivity was a help.

I bought my brother. No shooting, no fighting, not even much cussing. In
the end, Cougar smirked, took his hard currency, and released Marcus
from the slave collar. He had offered me the collar and a control unit
too---at added cost. Of course I didn't want it. Filthy things.

"Nice doin' business with you," Cougar said.

No. It hadn't been nice at all. "I still want the Noyer girls," I said.

He nodded. "I'll keep my eyes open. That young one over there is a real
good fit to the description you gave."

I turned to Dan. "Is she...anything like your sisters?"

The girl and Dan stared at one another, and it hit me again that I was
going to have to walk away and leave these children to their pimp. I
avoided looking at the girl.

"Yeah, she looks a little like Nina," Dan mumbled. "But what good is
that? She's not Nina. What good is anything?"

"Can you tell him anything more that would help him recognize either of
your sisters if he sees them?" I asked.

"I don't want him to recognize them." Dan turned to stare at Cougar. "I
don't want him to touch them. I'd kill him! I swear I would!"

Bankole took him to the truck, and Travis, in spite of his confusion,
followed with Marcus. I went back into George's and took care of
Dolores. She hadn't found Dan's sister, but she had done me a favor that
I would never have imagined anyone could do. She had more than earned
her fee.

As for Dan I couldn't really blame him for his attitude. But we couldn't
afford a fight now. I was too close to my own edge. Leaving the rest of
the kids, especially the little ones, was horrible. I had been willing
to fight for Marcus if I had to, but I might have gotten him and others
killed. I would have gotten someone killed. I don't know how to stop
people like Cougar, but I don't think killing off their victims, their
human property, is the best way.

Inside the truck, I hugged my brother. He was as unresponsive as a stick
at first, but after a moment he held me away from him and stared at me
for at least a full minute. He didn't say anything. He just shook his
head. Then he hugged me. After a while, he put his hand to his throat.
He felt all around his neck where the damned collar had been. Then he
just kind of curled up on himself. He lay on his side in fetal position,
and I sat beside him. He flinched when I touched him, so I just sat
there.

And I told the others. "He's my brother," I said. "I...for five years, I
believed...that he was dead." And then I couldn't say anything more. I
just sat with him. I don't know what the others did apart from keeping
watch and driving us home. If they talked, I didn't hear them. I didn't
care what they did.

In all, Bankole told me, my brother had three active venereal
infections. Also, his upper back and shoulders, his left arm, and the
outside of his left leg were covered with an ugly network of old burn
scars. No wonder Cougar had wanted to get rid of him. He probably
thought he'd cheated me, palmed a defective off on me. Someone might
once have done the same to him. Marcus was so good-looking that Cougar
might have been persuaded to buy him in a rush without stripping him to
look him over. But Marcus had suffered terrible burns sometime in the
past, and Bankole said he had been shot, too.

When Bankole had finished examining him, he gave him something to help
him sleep. That seemed best. Marcus had not objected to being examined.
I assured him before I left them together that Bankole was a doctor and
my husband as well. He didn't say anything. I asked him what he wanted
to eat. He shrugged and whispered, "Nothing. I'm okay."

"He's far from okay," Bankole told me later. But because Marcus wasn't
in serious physical pain, we could keep him with us. We gave him a space
behind screens---room dividers---in our kitchen. It was warm there, and
we had set up a bed, a dresser, a pitcher and basin, and a lamp. Like
every other household in the community, we sometimes had to take people
in---strangers who were visiting, new people joining us, or neighbors
within the community who weren't getting along with others in their own
households.

I worried that Marcus, in his present state of mind, might get up in the
night and run away. How long must he have dreamed of running away from
Cougar and his friends? Now, waking up in a strange place, and not quite
remembering how he had gotten there....Just to be sure even after he had
taken his sleeping pill, I went out and told our night watch---Beth
Faircloth and Lucio Figueroa---to be careful. I told them Marcus might
awake confused, and try to run away, and that they should be careful
about shooting at a lone figure trying to get *away* from Acorn. Under
normal circumstances such a figure would be thought a thief, and might
be shot. We'd had great trouble with thieves during our first year, and
we learned that if we were to survive, we couldn't afford to have much
sympathy for them.

But Marcus must not be shot.

"You told me Zahra Balter saw your stepmother and your brothers shot
down back in Robledo," Bankole said to me as we lay in bed together.
"Well, he's been beaten, shot, and burned. I can't imagine how he
survived. Someone must have taken care of him, and it wouldn't have been
your friend Cougar."

"No, it wouldn't have been Cougar," I agreed. "I want to know what
happened. I hope he'll tell us. How was he with you when I left you two
alone together?"

"Silent. Responsive and unembarrassed, but not speaking one unnecessary
word."

"You're sure you can cure his infections?"

"They shouldn't be a problem. Let alone, any one of them would have
killed him sooner or later. But with treatment, he should be all
right---physically, anyway."

"He was 14 when I saw him last. He liked playing soccer and reading
about the past and about foreign places. He was always taking things
apart and sometimes getting them back together again, and he had a huge
crush on Robin Balter, Harry's youngest sister. I don't know anything
about him now. I don't know who he is."

"You'll have plenty of time to find out. I've told him he's going to be
an uncle, by the way."

"Reaction?"

"None at all. At the moment, I don't think that even he knows who he is.
He seems willing enough to be looked after; but I get the feeling he
doesn't much care what happens to him. I think...I hope that that will
change. You may be his best medicine."

"He was my favorite brother---and always the best-looking person in the
family. He's still one of the best-looking people I've ever seen."

"Yes," Bankole said. "In spite of his scars, he's a good-looking boy. I
wonder whether his looks have saved him or destroyed him. Or both."

It seems that things can never go well for long.

Dan Noyer has run away. He slipped past the watch and out of Acorn at
least in part because of the instructions I gave to the night watch.
Beth Faircloth says she saw someone---a man or boy, she thought.

"I thought the figure was too tall to be Marcus," she said when she
phoned me. "But I wasn't sure---so I didn't shoot." The running figure
had been dressed in dark clothing with something dark over the head and
face.

Not until I had verified that Marcus was still there did I think of Dan.

To tell the truth, I had forgotten about Dan. My mind had been filled
with Marcus---getting him back, keeping him, wondering what had happened
to him. I had paid no attention to Dan. Yet Dan had suffered a terrible
disappointment. He was in real pain. I knew that, and I left him to the
Balters, who, after all, have two energetic little kids of their own to
deal with.

I got Zahra out of bed and asked her to check on Dan. He had been
staying with them for four months now. Of course, he was gone. His note
said, "I know you'll think I'm wrong, but I have to find them. I can't
let them be with someone like that Cougar. They're my sisters!" And
after his signature, a postscript: "Take care of Kassi and Mercy until I
come back. I'll work for you and pay you. I'll bring Paula and Nina back
and they'll work too."

He's only 15. He saw Cougar and his crew. He saw my brother. He saw
Georgetown. And seeing all that, he learned nothing!

No, that's not true. He's learned---or finally realized---all the wrong
things. I had assumed he knew what his sisters' fate might be if they
were alive---that they might be prostitutes, might wind up in some rich
man's harem or working as slave farm or factory laborers. Or, I suppose,
they might wind up with some pervert who likes cutting out female
tongues. They might even wind up as the property of someone who cares
for them and looks after them even as he makes sexual use of them. That
would be the best possibility. The worst, perhaps, is that they might
survive for a while as "specialists"---prostitutes used to serve crazies
and sadists. These don't live long, and that's a mercy. Theirs is a fate
that could also befall a big, baby-faced, well-built boy like Dan. I
wonder how much of this Dan understands. He is a good, brave, stupid
boy, and I suspect he'll pay for it.

He might come back, of course. He might come to his senses and come home
to help take care of Kassia and Mercy. Or we might find him through our
outside contacts. I'll have to make sure that the word is out on him as
well as on Nina and Paula. Problem is, finding him won't help if he's
still intent on hunting for his sisters. We can't chain him here. Or
rather, we won't. If he insists on dying, he will die, damn him. Damn!

[FROM]{.small} *Warrior* [BY MARCOS DURAN]{.small}

W[HEN I WAS A]{.small} kid, I never let anyone know how much the future
scared me. In fact, I couldn't see any future. I was born into a world
that was no bigger than the walled neighborhood enclave where my family
lived. My father had lived there as a boy and inherited the house from
his father.

My world was a cage. When one of my brothers dared to leave the cage, to
run away from home, someone outside caught him and cut and burned all
the flesh from his living body. Sometimes I catch myself wondering how
long it took him to die.

I admit, my brother was no angel. He was mean and not very bright. He
loved our mother, and he was her favorite, but I don't think he ever
gave a damn about anyone else. Still, even though he was as tall as our
father, he was only 14 when he was killed. To me, that makes the men who
killed him worse than he ever was. How could they be human and do a
thing like that to somebody? I used to imagine them---the
killers---waiting for me whenever neighborhood adults with guns risked
taking us out of the cage for a little while. The world outside was like
my brother at his worst multiplied by about a thousand: stupid, mean, so
out of control that it might do anything. It was like a dog with rabies,
tearing itself to pieces, and wanting to do the same to me.

And then it did just that.

Oh, yes. It did.

I could return the compliment. I could have reached for the power to do
that. But I would rather fix the problem. What happened to me shouldn't
happen to anyone, yet such things have happened to thousands of people,
perhaps millions. I've read history. Things weren't always this way.
They don't have to go on being this way. What we have broken we can
mend.

**My Uncle Marc was the handsomest man I've ever seen. I think I fell
more than half in love with him before I even met him.**

**There were also times when I was afraid for him. I don't know what to
make of our family. My grandfather was, from what I've heard, a good and
dedicated Baptist minister. He looked after his family and his community
and insisted that both be armed and able to defend themselves in an
armed and dangerous world, but beyond that, he had no ambitions. It
never seemed to occur to him that he could or should fix the world. Yet
he was the father of two would-be world-fixers. How did that happen?**

**Well, my mother was a sharer, a little adult at 15, and a survivor of
the destruction of her whole neighborhood at 18. Perhaps that was why
she, like Uncle Marc, needed to take charge, to bring her own brand of
order to the chaos that she saw swallow so many of the people she loved.
She saw chaos as natural and inevitable and as clay to be shaped and
directed. As she says in one of her verses:**

***Chaos***

***Is God's most dangerous face*---**

***Amorphous, roiling, hungry.***

***Shape Chaos*---**

***Shape God.***

***Act.***

***Alter the speed***

***Or the direction of Change.***

***Vary the scope of Change.***

***Recombine the seeds of Change.***

***Transmute the impact of Change.***

***Seize Change,***

***Use it.***

***Adapt and grow.***

**And so she tried to adapt and to grow. Perhaps she feared being like
her own mother, who looked for help in a "smart" drug and wound up
damaging her child and killing herself.**

**Chaos. Whatever my mother's reasoning, she decided that she knew what
was wrong with her world, and she knew what would fix it: Earthseed.
Earthseed with all its definitions, admonitions, requirements,

**My Uncle Marc, on the other hand, hated the chaos. It wasn't one of
the faces of his god. It was unnatural. It was demonic. He hated what it
had done to him, and he needed to prove that he was not what it had
forced him to become. No Christian minister could ever hate sin as much
as Marc hated chaos. His gods were order, stability, safety, control. He
was a man with a wound that would not heal until he could be certain
that what had happened to him could not happen again to anyone, ever.**

**My father called my mother a zealot. I think that name applies even
more to Uncle Marc. And yet, I think Uncle Marc was more of a realist.
Uncle Marc wanted to make the Earth a better place. Uncle Marc knew that
the stars could take care of themselves.**

[SATURDAY, DECEMBER]{.small} 18, 2032

Dan hasn't come back. I had no reason to expect him to give up and come
home so quickly, but I did hope. Jorge, Diamond Scott, and Gray Mora are
going to trade at the Coy street market today. I've told them to leave
word with the few people we know in Coy, and on the way back, to tell
the Sullivan family. Their quickest way home takes them past the
Sullivan place.

Marcus slept through the night, causing no trouble to himself or to us.
Bankole happened to be in the kitchen when he awoke, and that was good.
Bankole took him out to one of our composting toilets. I didn't see him
until later when he had washed and dressed. Then he came hesitant and
tentative, to my kitchen table.

"Hungry?" I asked. "Sit down."

He stared at me for several seconds, then said, "When I woke up, I
thought all this was just a dream."

I put a piece of fruit-laden acorn bread in front of him. We had both
been raised on the stuff because our old neighborhood happened to have
several very fruitful California live oak trees within the walls. My
father didn't believe in waste, so he found out how to use acorns as
food. Native Americans did it. We could do it. He and my mother worked
at learning to use not only acorns but cactuses, palm fruit, and other
plants that might otherwise be seen as useless. For Marcus and me, all
this was food from home.

Marcus took the acorn bread, lit into it, and chewed slowly. First he
looked delighted, then tears began to stream down his face. I gave him a
napkin and a glass of what had once been a favorite morning drink of
his---a mug of hot, sweet apple juice with a lemon squeezed into it. The
apples we pressed in southern California were of a different variety,
but I don't think he noticed. He ate, wiped his eyes, looked around. He
stared at Bankole as Bankole came in, then focused on the rest of his
breakfast, all but huddling over it the way a hawk does when its
claiming and protecting its kill. There was no more talk for a while.

When we had all had enough to eat, Bankole looked at Marcus and said,
"I've been married to your sister for five years. During all that time,
we believed that you and the rest of her family were dead."

"I thought she was dead, too," Marcus said.

"Zahra Balter---she was Zahra Moss when you knew her---she said she saw
all of you killed," I told him.

He frowned. "Moss? Balter?"

"We didn't know Zahra very well back home. She was married to Richard
Moss. He was killed and she married Harry Balter."

"God," he said. "I never thought I'd hear those names again. I do
remember Zahra---tiny, beautiful, and tough."

"She's still all three. She and Harry are here. They've got two kids."

"I want to see them!"

"Okay."

"Who else is here?"

"A lot of people who've been through hard times. No one else from home,
though. This community is called Acorn."

"There was a little girl...Robin. Robin Balter?"

"Harry's little sister. She didn't make it."

"You thought I didn't."

"I...saw Robin's body, Marc. She didn't make it."

He sighed and stared at his hands resting in his lap. "I did die back in
ʼ27. I died. There's nothing left."

"There's family," I said. "There's me, Bankole, the niece or nephew
who'll be born next year. You're free now. You can stay here and make a
life for yourself in Acorn. I hope you will. But you're free to do what
you want. No one here wears a collar."

"Have you ever worn one?" he asked.

"No. Some of us have been slaves, but I never was. And I believe you're
the first of us who's worn a collar. I hope you'll talk or write about
what happened to you since the old neighborhood was destroyed."

He seemed to think about that for a while. "No," he said. "No."

Too soon. "Okay," I said, "but...do you think any of the others could
have survived? Cory or Ben or Greg? Is it possible...?"

"No," he repeated. "No, they're dead. I got out. They didn't."

Sometime later, as we got up from the table, two men arrived by truck
from the little coastal town of Halstead. Like Acorn,

Halstead is well off the main highway. In fact, Halstead must be the
most remote, isolated town in our area with the Pacific Ocean on three
sides of it and low mountains behind it.

In spite of all that, Halstead has a major problem. Halstead used to
have a beach and above the beach was a palisade where the town began.
Along the palisade, some of the biggest, nicest houses sat, overlooking
the ocean. On one side of the peninsula were the old houses, large,
well-built wood frame structures. On the other side were newer houses
built on land that was once a seaside golf course. All of these
are...were lined up along the palisade. I don't know why people would
build their homes on the edge of a cliff like that, but they did. Now,
whenever we have heavy rains, when there's an earthquake, or when the
level of the sea rises enough to saturate more land, great blocks of the
palisades drop into the sea, and the houses sitting on them break apart
and fall. Sometimes half a house falls into the sea. Sometimes it's
several houses. Last night it was three of them. The people of Halstead
were still fishing victims out of the sea. Worse, the community doctor
had been delivering a baby in one of the lost houses. That's why the
community was turning to Bankole for help. Bankole had been on good
terms with their doctor. The people of Halstead trusted Bankole because
their doctor had trusted him.

"What are you people thinking?" Bankole demanded of the weary, desperate
Halstead men as he and I snatched up things he would need. He was adding
to his medical bag. I was packing an overnight case for him. Marcus had
looked from one of us to the other, then moved off to one side, out of
the way.

"Why do you still have people living on the cliffs?" Bankole demanded.
He sounded angry. Unnecessary pain and death still made him angry. "How
many times does this kind of thing have to happen before you get the
idea?" he asked. He shut his bag and grabbed the overnight case that I
handed him. "Move the damned houses inland, for heaven's sake. Make it a
long-term community effort."

"We're doing what we can," a big red-haired man said, moving toward the
door. He pushed his hair out of his face with a dirty, abraded hand.
"We've moved some. Others refuse to have their houses moved. They think
they'll be okay. We can't force them."

Bankole shook his head, then kissed me. "This could take two or three
days," he said. "Don't worry, and don't do anything foolish. Behave
yourself!" And he went.

I sighed, and began to clear away the breakfast things.

"So he really is a doctor," Marcus said.

I paused and looked at him. "Yes, and he and I really are married," I
said. "And I'm really pregnant. Did you think we were telling you lies?"

"...no. I don't know." He paused. "You can't change everything in your
life all at once. You just can't."

"You can," I said. "We both have. It hurts. It's terrible. But you can
do it."

He reached for the plate I was about to take, and scavenged a few crumbs
of Acorn bread from it. "It tastes like Mama's," he said, and he looked
up at me. "I didn't believe it was you at first. Yesterday in that
godforsaken shantytown, I saw you, and I thought I had finally lost my
mind. I remember, I thought, 'Good. Now I'm crazy. Now nothing matters.
Maybe I'll see Mama, too. Maybe I'm dead.' But I could still feel the
weight of the collar around my neck, so I knew I wasn't dead. Just
crazy."

"Then you knew me," I said. "And you looked away before Cougar could see
that you knew me. I saw you."

He swallowed. Nodded. A long time later, he shut his eyes and leaned his
face into his hand. "If you still want me to," he said, "I'll tell you
what happened."

I managed not to sigh with relief. "Thank you."

"I mean, you've got to tell me things, too. Like how you wound up here.
And how you wound up married to a man older than Dad."

"He's a year younger than Dad. And when we had both lost almost
everything else and everyone else, we found each other. Laugh if you
want to, but we were damned lucky."

"I'm not laughing. I found good people too, at first. Or rather, they
found me."

I sat down opposite him, and waited. For a time, he stared at the wall,
at nothing, at the past.

"Everything was burning on that last night," he said. His voice was low
and even. "There was so much shooting....Hoards of bald, painted people,
mostly kids, had rammed their damned truck through our gate. They were
everywhere. And they had their fun with Ben and Greg and Mama and me. In
all the confusion, Lauren, we didn't even know you were gone until we
had almost reached the gate. Then a blue-painted guy grabbed Ben---just
snatched him and tried to run off with him. I was too small to do any
good fighting him one-on-one, but I was fast. I ran after him and
tackled him. I might not have been able to bring him down by myself, but
Mama jumped on him too. We dragged him down, and when he fell, he hit
his head on the concrete and he dropped Ben. Mama grabbed Ben and I
grabbed Greg. Greg had hurt his foot---stepped on a rock and twisted
it---while we were running.

"This time, we made it out through the wrecked gate. I didn't know where
we were going. I was just following Mama, and we were both looking
around for you." He paused. "What happened to you?"

"I saw someone get shot," I said, remembering, shuddering with the
memory. "I shared the pain of the gunshot, got caught up in the death.
Then when I could get up, I found a gun. I took it from the hand of
someone who was dead. That was good because a moment later, one of the
paints grabbed me, and I had to shoot him. I shared his death, and in
the confusion of that, I lost track of you guys and of time. When I
could, I ran out of the gate and spent the rest of the night a few
blocks north of our neighborhood huddling in someone's half-burned
garage. The next day I came back looking for you. That's when I found
Harry and Zahra. We were all pretty beaten up. Zahra told me you guys
were dead."

Marcus shook his head. "I wish we had been with you. Then we could have
been just 'beaten up.' Everything went wrong for us. Just as we went
through the gate another group of paints arrived."

He paused. "You know, I met some paints later. Most of them killed
themselves off, with their drugs, or with their drug-induced love of
fire. But there are still a few around. Anyway...I was collared with
some a few months ago. They said their whole deal was to help the poor
by killing off the rich and letting the poor take their stuff. If you
lived in a place where the houses weren't falling down, and especially
if you had a wall around your neighborhood or your house, that meant you
were rich. The crazy thing was, a lot of the paint kids really were
rich. One of the girls I met, her family had more money than our whole
neighborhood put together. She had pretty much given up everything for
the paints, but in the end her friends betrayed her. One day while she
was spaced out on something, they sold her to be collared because she
was still young and cute, and they needed money for drugs. But she still
thought she'd done some good. We couldn't convince her. We figured the
drugs had wiped out her mind."

"She had to believe in something," I said. "And after all, what did she
have left?"

"I guess. Anyway, we were caught between these two groups of goddamn
saviors of the poor." He sighed. "They were shooting---most of them
firing into the air at first---and waving torches....More fire....We
couldn't do anything but run back in through the gate.

"Everything was crazy. Ben and Greg were crying. People were running
everywhere. All the houses were burning. Then someone shot me. I was
knocked down, stunned. At first I didn't understand what had hit me.
Then I felt this unbelievable pain. I must have dropped Greg. I tried to
look around for him. That's when I understood that I was down on the
sidewalk. I felt slammed down, stomped, plus stabbed through the right
shoulder and arm by a hot poker. I never knew who shot me or why. We
didn't have guns. I guess they just shot us for fun.

"Then I saw Mama get shot. The truth is, it all happened so fast---first
me, then her, bang, bang. I know that. But at the time....I remember
seeing it all, taking it all in as though I had plenty of time. And yet
I was desperate to get out of there, and scared to death. Jesus God,
there's no way I can make you know how bad it was.

"I saw Mama stagger and collapse. She made a horrible noise, and I saw
blood pouring from her neck. I knew then that...she...that she was
dying. I knew it.

"I tried to get up, tried to make myself go to her. But while I was
struggling to stand, a green-painted woman ran up and shot her through
the head.

"I slipped in my own blood and fell back. From the ground, I saw a red
guy shoot Ben twice through the head, then step over him and shoot Greg.
I saw him. I was yelling. The red guy had an automatic rifle---an old
AK-47. He shot Ben while Ben was trying to get up. Ben's
head...just...broke apart.

"But Greg was down on the sidewalk---moving, but down. When the guy shot
him, the bullets must have ricocheted off the concrete. They hit another
paint in the legs. He screamed and fell down. That made all the paints
nearby mad. It was like they thought we had shot their man---like his
being wounded was our fault. They grabbed all four of us and dragged us
over to the Balter house. It was burning, and they threw us into the
fire.

"They did that. They threw us into the fire. I was the only one who was
conscious. I was maybe the only one alive, but I couldn't stop them.
Somehow, though, once they threw me in, I got up and ran out. I just
ran, panicked out of my mind, blind with smoke and pain, not human
anymore. I should have died.

"Later, I wished I had died. Later, all I wanted to do was die."

Marcus stopped and sat silent for several seconds.

"Someone must have helped you," I said when I thought the silence had
gone on long enough. "You were only 14."

"I was only 14," he agreed. After another silence, he went on.

"I think I must have fallen down in the Balter yard. I was on fire. I
didn't think about rolling on the ground to put the fire out, but I must
have done it. I was just scrambling around in panic and pain, and the
fire did go out. Then all I could do was lie there. I must have passed
out at some point. When I woke up---I have a clear memory of this---I
was on a big wooden wagon on top of a lot of scorched clothes and some
pots and pans and junk. I could see the sidewalk passing under
me---broken concrete, weeds growing in the holes and cracks, and I could
see the backs of a man and woman walking ahead, leaning forward, pulling
the wagon with rope harnesses. Then I passed out again.

"A pair of scavengers, picking over the bones of our neighborhood had
found me groaning---although I don't remember groaning or being
found---and they had loaded me onto their salvage wagon. They were a
middle-aged couple named Duran, believe it or not. Maybe they were
distant relatives or something. It's a pretty common name, though."

I nodded. Not unusual at all, but the only Duran I happened to know was
my stepmother. Duran was her maiden name. Well, if these Durans had
saved my brother's life five years ago when he couldn't have lived
without their help, I was more than willing to be related to them.

"They had had an 11-year old daughter kidnapped from them the year
before they found me," Marcus said. "They never found her, never found
out what happened to her, but I can guess. You could sell a pretty
little girl for a lot then. Just like now. I've heard people say things
are getting better. Maybe so, but I haven't noticed. Anyway the Durans
were handsome people. Their daughter could have been really pretty."

He sighed. "The kid's name was Caridad. They said I looked enough like
her to be her brother. The woman said that. Inez was her name. She was
the one who insisted on collecting what was left of me and taking it
home to nurse back to health.

"I'm surprised I even looked human when she found me. My face wasn't too
bad---blood and bruises from falling down a few times. But the rest of
me was a hell of a mess.

"There was no way these people could afford a doctor---not even for
themselves. So Inez herself worked on me. She worked so hard to save
me---like a second mother. The man thought I would die. He thought it
was stupid to waste time, effort, and valuable resources on me. But he
loved her, so he let her have her way.

"These people were a lot poorer than we used to be, but they did what
they could with what they had. For me that meant soap and water, aspirin
and aloe vera. Why I didn't die of 20 infections I don't know. I goddamn
sure wanted to die. I'll tell you, I'd rather blow my own brains out
than go through that again."

I shook my head. I had no medical training beyond first aid, and I doubt
that I'd be much good administering that, but I'd lived with Bankole
long enough to know how nasty burns could be. "No complications at all?"
I demanded.

Marcus shook his head. "I don't know, really. Most of the time I was in
so much pain I didn't know what was going on. How could I tell a
complication from the general run of misery?"

I shook my head, and wondered what Bankole would say when I told him.
Soap and water and aspirin and aloe vera. Well, a little humility would
be good for him. To Marcus, I said, "What happened to the Durans?"

"Dead," he whispered. "At least I guess they're dead. So many died. I
never found their bodies, though, and I tried. I did try."

Long silence.

"Marcus?" I reached over and put my hand on his.

He pulled away and put his hands to his face. I heard him sigh behind
them. Then he began to talk again. "Four years after our neighborhood
burned, the city of Robledo decided to clean itself up. The Durans and I
were squatters. We shared a big, abandoned stucco house with five other
families. That meant we were part of the trash that the new mayor, the
city council, and the business community wanted to sweep out. It seemed
to them that all the trouble of the past few years was our fault---poor
people's fault, I mean. Homeless people's fault. Squatters' fault. So
they sent an army of cops to drive out everyone who couldn't prove they
had a right to be where they were. You had to have rent receipts, a
deed, utility receipts, something. At first, there was a hell of a
business in fake paper. I wrote some of it myself---not for sale, but
for the Durans and their friends. Most people couldn't read or write or
at least not in English, so they needed help. I saw that some of them
were paying hard currency for crap, so I started writing---rent
receipts, mostly. In the end, it was all for nothing. Between them, the
city and the county owned most of the rotting buildings in our area, and
the cops knew we didn't belong there, no matter what papers we had. They
drove us all out---poor squatters, drug dealers, junkies, crazies,
gangs, whores, you name it."

"Where were you living?" I asked. "What part of town?"

"Valley Street," Marcus said. "Old factory buildings, parking
structures, ancient houses and stores, all packed with people."

"And vacant lots full of weeds and trash where people dump inconvenient
dead bodies," I continued for him.

"That's the area, yes. The Durans were poor. They worked all the time,
but sometimes they didn't even get enough to eat---especially sharing
with me. When I was well enough, I worked with them. We cleaned,
repaired, and sold anything we could salvage. We took whatever jobs we
could get---cleaning, assembling, constructing, repairing. They never
lasted long. There were a lot of people like us and not so many jobs, so
wages were terrible. Just food and water sometimes, or some old clothes
or shoes or something. They'd even pay you in American money if they
thought they could get away with palming it off on you. Hard currency if
they gave a damn about treating you right. Most didn't. Also, hard
currency if they were a little bit afraid of you or of your friends.

"In spite of all our efforts, there was no way we could afford to rent
even a shabby little apartment or house. We lived on Valley Street
because we couldn't do any better. With all that, though, it probably
wasn't as bad as you think. People looked after one another there,
except for the worst junkies and thugs. Everyone knew who they were. I
did reading and writing for people even before the fake-paper craze.
They paid me what they could. And...I helped some of them hold church on
Sundays. There was an old carport behind the house we lived in. It
projected from a garage where three families lived, but as it happened,
no one lived under the carport. We met for church there and I would
preach and teach as best I could. They let me do it. They came to hear
me even though I was a kid. I taught them songs and everything. They
said I had a gift, a calling. The truth was, thanks to Dad, I knew more
about the Bible than any of them, and more about real church."

He paused, looked at me. "I liked it, you know? I prayed with them,
helped them any way I could. Their lives were so terrible. There wasn't
much I could do, but I did what I could. It was important to them that I
had recovered from burns and gunshots. A lot of them had seen me back
when I looked like vomit. They thought if I could recover from that, God
must have something in mind for me.

"The Durans were proud of me. They gave me their name. I was Marcos
Duran. That's who I was during my four years with them. That's who I
still am. I found a real home there.

"Then the cops came and drove us into the street. Behind them came
demolition crews to push down the houses, blow up the buildings, and
destroy everything we had been forced to leave behind. People were
dragged or driven into the street without all kinds of things---spare
clothing, money, pictures, personal papers....Some people who couldn't
speak English were even driven out without relatives who had managed to
hide or who were too sick or disabled to run. The cops dragged some of
these out and put them in trucks. They didn't find them all. I sent them
to get seven that I knew of, and they brought them out.

"But everything was chaos. People kept trying to run back to get their
things, and the cops kept stopping them---or trying to. Some of the cops
were in armored personnel carriers. The ones on foot had full body
armor, masks, shields, automatic rifles, gas, whips, clubs, you name it,
but still, some people tried to stop them, or at least to hurt them. The
people threw rocks, bottles, even precious cans of food.

"Then someone fired three shots, and one of the cops went down. I don't
know whether he was wounded or he tripped, but there were the shots, and
he fell. And that was that. Everything went to hell.

"The cops started shooting. People ran, screamed, shot back if they had
guns. I got separated from the Durans. I started looking for them even
before the shooting stopped. No one shot me this time, but I didn't find
the Durans. I never found them. I tried for days. I looked at as many
dead bodies as I could before they were collected. I did everything I
could think of, but they were gone. After a while, I knew they must be
dead, and I was alone again."

Marcus sat still, staring into space. "I loved them," he said, his voice
soft and filled with pain. "And I loved being Marcos Duran---the little
preacher. People trusted me, respected me....It was a good life. Most of
them were good people---just poor. They deserved so much better than
they got." He shook his head.

"I didn't know what to do," he continued after a moment. "I hung around
the Valley Street area for two more weeks, saw all the buildings go down
and the rubble carried away. I stole food where I could, avoided the
cops, and kept looking for the Durans. I'd said they were dead, and on
some level, I believed they were, but I couldn't stop looking.

"But there was nothing. No one." He hesitated. "No, that's not quite
right. Some people from my poor, half-assed church came back to see what
was left. I met three families of them. They all asked me to stay with
them. They had relatives squatting in other hovels, overcrowded like you
wouldn't believe, but they figured they could take in one more. I had
nothing, but they wanted me. I should have gone with them. I probably
would have set up another church outside of town, gotten married, and
raised a family---Dad all over again. I would have been okay. Poor, but
okay. Poor doesn't matter as much if you can make a place for yourself
and be respected. I know that now, but I didn't then.

"I was 18. I figured it was time for me to be a man, get out on my own.
I figured there was nothing for me in southern California. It was a
place where you could only be poor unless you were born rich or you were
a really successful crook. I thought that meant I had to go north. There
was always a river of people walking north on the freeway. I thought
they must know something. I talked to people about Alaska, Canada,
Washington, Oregon...I never intended to stay in California."

"Neither did I," I said.

"You walked up?"

"I did. So did Bankole, Harry, Zahra....A lot of us did."

"Nobody bothered you?"

"A lot of people bothered us. Harry, Zahra, and I survived because we
stuck together and one of us always kept watch. We started out with my
one gun. We gathered more people and more guns along the way. I lost
count of the number of times we were nearly killed. One of us was
killed. There may be an easy way to get here, but we didn't find it."

"Neither did I. But why did you come here? I mean, why didn't you keep
going to Oregon or someplace?"

"Bankole owns this land," I said. "By the time we got near here, well,
he and I wanted to stay together, but I also wanted...I wanted to keep
the rest of the group together. I was building a community---a group of
families and single people who were still human."

"You walk the roads for a while, and you wonder if anyone is still
human."

"Yeah."

"The people you brought here---they built this place?"

I nodded. "There was nothing here when we got here but the ashes of a
house, the bones of Bankole's relatives, some untended crops and trees,
and a well. There were only 13 of us then. There are 66 of us now---67
with you."

"You just let people come here and stay? What if they rob you, cheat
you, kill you? What if they're crazy?"

"Give me some credit, Marc."

His face changed in an odd way. "You. You personally." He paused. "I
thought at first this was Bankole's place, that he'd taken you in."

"I told you, this is his land."

"But it's your place."

"It's our place. I've shaped it, but it doesn't belong to me. I've
invited people to come here and build lives for themselves, to join us."
I hesitated, wondering how much he still believed in religion as our
father had taught it to us. When he was little, he always seemed to take
Dad's religion as real, as obvious, as a given. But what did he believe
now that he had suffered the destruction of two homes and the loss of
two families, then endured prostitution and slavery? He still had not
talked about that last part of his story. Had his religion given him
hope, or had it withered and fallen away when his God did not rescue
him? Back in Robledo, he had run a simple outdoor church, had been
serious about it. But where was he now? I made myself continue. "And
I've given them a belief system to help them deal with the world as it
is and the world as it can be---as people like them can make it."

"You mean you're their preacher?" he asked.

I nodded. "We don't call it that, but yes."

He looked surprised, then gave a short bark of laughter. "Religion is in
our genes," he said. "It must be. Either that or Dad did a hell of a job
on us."

"We call our system Earthseed," I said. "My actual title is 'Shaper.' "

He stared at me for several seconds, saying nothing. He still looked
surprised, and now confused. "Earthseed?" he said at last. "My god, I've
heard of you guys. You're that cult!"

"So we've been called."

"There was a politician. He was running for the state senate, I think.
He won. He was a Jarret supporter. He was making a speech in Arcata when
I was up there, and he was listing devil-worshiping cults. He named
Earthseed as one of them. I'd never heard of it, but I remember because
he was going on about how the name actually referred to the devil, the
seed deep in the earth and growing like a poisonous fungus to spread its
evil to more and more people."

"Oh, Marc...."

"I didn't make it up. He really said that."

I drew a deep breath. "We don't worship the devil. In fact, we don't
worship anyone. And we are Earthseed. Human beings are Earthseed. We
have no devils. But we're so small that I'm surprised your politician
had ever heard of us. And I wish he hadn't. Such lies!"

He shrugged. "It was just politics. You know those guys will say
anything. But why would you stop being a Christian? Why would you make
up a new religion?"

"I didn't make it up. It was something I had been thinking about since I
was 12. It was---is---a collection of truths. It isn't the whole truth.
It isn't the only truth. It's just one collection of thoughts that are
true. I could never say anything about it at home. I never wanted to
hurt Dad. But his way didn't work for me. I wanted it to. I would have
been a lot more comfortable if it had. But it didn't. Earthseed does."

"But you made Earthseed up. Or if you didn't make it up, you read it or
heard about it somewhere."

I had heard this many times before. It seemed to be one of the things
that every new potential member said. I even kept a simple teaching tool
near at hand to deal with it. I got up and went to a bookshelf where a
beautiful piece of rose quartz that Bankole had given me acted as a
bookend for the few books I kept here in the house and not in the
library section of the school.

"Look at this," I said, "and tell me something." I put the rock in his
hands. "If I were to analyze this stone and find out exactly what it's
made of, would that mean I made it up?"

"That's not a good comparison, Lauren. The rock exists. Earthseed didn't
exist until you made it up."

"All the truths of Earthseed existed somewhere before I found them and
put them together. They were in the patterns of history, in science,
philosophy, religion, or literature. I didn't make any of them up."

"You just put them together."

"Yes."

"Then you did make Earthseed up the same way you would have made a novel
up if you wrote one. You wouldn't have to find anything brand-new for
your characters to do or be in a novel. I don't think you could if you
wanted to."

"Except that by definition, a novel is fiction. Don't call Earthseed
fiction. You don't know anything about it except the lies told by an
opportunistic politician." I took down a copy of *The First Book of the
Living* and handed it to him. "Come and talk to me after you've read
this."

"You wrote this?"

"Yes."

"And you believe in it?"

"I believe it. I wouldn't teach people that things were true if I didn't
believe them."

"Back in Robledo, I remember you were always writing. Keith used to
sneak into your room and read your diary. Or at least he said he did."

I thought about that for a moment. "I don't think he ever read my
journal," I said. "I mean, I know I was always chasing him out of my
room. I chased you out, too, plenty of times. But I think if Keith had
read my journal, he wouldn't have been able to resist using it against
me. Besides, Keith never read anything unless he had to."

"Yeah." He paused, gazing down at the table. "It's weird to think I'm
older now than he ever got to be. He still seems older and bigger when I
think about him. He was such a goddamn asshole." He shook his head. "I
think I really hated him, you know, the way he was always making trouble
for everybody, beating the rest of us up---except you. He was afraid of
you because you were so much bigger. And Mama...she loved him more than
she loved all of us put together."

"It wasn't that bad, Marc."

He looked up at me, solemn-eyed. "It was, though. She wasn't your
mother, so maybe you didn't feel it the way I did, but it was that bad
and then some."

"I felt it. Toward the end when she and I needed each other most, I'm
not sure she loved me at all. But she was so scared and so
desperate....Forgive her, Marc. She was in a hellish place with four
children to look out for. If it made her less rational than she should
have been...well, forgive her."

There was a long silence. He stared at the book, open at the first page:

*All that you touch*

*You Change.*

*All that you Change*

*Changes you.*

*The only lasting truth*

*Is Change.*

*God*

*Is Change.*

I couldn't tell whether he had read the words at first. He seemed to
stare the way blind people do, unseeing, blank. Then he whispered, "Oh,
god," and it sounded like a prayer. He shut the book and closed his
eyes. "I'm not sure I want to read your book, Lauren," he said. He
opened his eyes and looked at me. "You haven't asked how I wound up with
Cougar."

"I want to know," I admitted.

"Simple. My first night walking the freeway, three guys jumped me---big
guys. I didn't have much money and that pissed them off---you know, like
I was supposed to be rich so that robbing me would be worth their while.
If I wasn't rich, then I had cheated them, and they had a right to get
me for it. Shit."

He was staring at the table again, and I imagined him as he must have
been then, facing three big men. He had always been slight and much too
attractive for his own good---a beautiful boy, and now, such a handsome
young man. I had seen the girls and women of the community staring at
him as we brought him from the truck to the house last night. If he
stayed, they would be all over him.

He would be stronger now. He had a look of wiry strength about him. But
even now, he wouldn't be strong enough to hold off three attackers. And
he'd had no friends with him, watching his back on the freeway that
night.

After a while, he spoke again, still staring at the table. "They didn't
just beat the hell out of me and rape me and let me go," he said. "They
kept me so they could do it over and over again. And when they got tired
of me, they sold me to a pimp. Not Cougar. He came later. The first one
called himself Zorro. All these guys seem to have stupid names. Anyway,
Zorro was the first to put a collar around my neck. After that people
didn't have to bother beating me up---unless they felt like it. Some
people get turned on by beating the shit out of a guy who can't fight
back. And....You know the worst thing about a collar, Lauren? They can
torture you with it every day. Every goddamn day. And you never have any
marks to mess you up and drive down your price, and you never die of it!
Or most people don't die of it. Some are lucky. They have heart attacks
or strokes and they die. But the rest of us live no matter what. And if
we try to find some other way to die, to kill ourselves, they can stop
us. The guy with the control unit can play you the way Mama used to play
her piano. You get so you'll do anything---anything!---just to get him
to let you alone for a few minutes. You walk past a corpse on the
road---some poor old guy who couldn't walk any farther or a woman
someone had raped and killed. You walk past the corpse, and you wish
like hell it was you."

He sighed and shook his head. "That's it, really. I had one more owner
between Zorro and Cougar, but he was walking shit too. You can't own
people and torture them for fun and profit without being shit. A pimp
would sell his mother and his daughter if the price were right. And if I
ever get the chance, I swear to god, Lauren, I'll stake all three of
them out and I'll burn them---like Jarret's people do with their
so-called witches." After a moment, he added, "I saw that done once---a
burning. Sargent---my second owner---did it to a woman who tried to kill
him in his sleep. She was a beautiful woman. Sargent and his friends
wiped out her family to get her, but then he slept with her before she
had learned the rules.

"These are the rules: Once you've got a collar on, you can't run. Get a
certain distance from the control unit and the collar chokes you. I mean
it gives you so much pain that you can't keep going. You pass out if you
try. We called that getting choked. Touch the control unit and the
collar chokes you. It won't work for you anyway. It's got a fingerprint
lock. And if the fingers trying to use it are wrong or are dead, it
chokes you and stays on choke until someone with the right living
fingers turns it off. Or until you die. When someone threatens a pimp,
sometimes he'll make his oldest, least popular whores fight for him,
shield him. The truth is, while they're wearing the collars, all his
whores will fight for him, no matter how much they hate him. They'll
fight hard. They might not even care whether or not they get killed.

"And, of course, if you try to cut, burn, or otherwise damage the
collar, it chokes you.

"The girl, she tried to take revenge for her family. She never knew why
the other whore Sargent had with him that night stopped her. The other
whore begged her not to do it. He tried to explain, but she wouldn't
listen. Then Sargent woke up. The next day, he gathered all his whores
together, and he staked the girl out naked and made us all gather wood
and stack it around her and on top of her with just her head showing.
Then he made us watch while he...while he burned her."

It occurred to me that Marcus was the "other whore" who saved Sargent's
life. Maybe he was. I would not ask. Perhaps on some level, the "other
whore" was him even if it wasn't, really. A collar, my brother was
saying, makes you turn traitor against your kind, against your freedom,
against yourself. This was what had been done to him. And what had it
made of him? Who and what was he now? No one could go through what he
has gone through and not change somehow. No wonder the first of the
Earthseed verses had reached him.

I took him to see Zahra and Harry, and they both hugged him, amazed.
Zahra, in particular, who had seen him shot and thrown into the fire,
kept staring at him and touching him. He stared back at them the way
I've seen half-starved people stare at food that they couldn't beg, buy,
or steal.

[SUNDAY, DECEMBER]{.small} 19, 2032

"Call me Marcos," my brother said to me as I showed him our
school-library-Gathering Hall. He was about to attend his first
Gathering, but I had brought him to the school early so that he could
see more of what we had built. He seemed impressed with the building and
with our collection of salvaged, purchased, and bartered books, but I
had gotten the impression that there was something else on his mind. Now
here it was.

"I've been Marcos Duran for more than five years now," he said. "I don't
really know how to be Marcus Olamina anymore."

I didn't know what to make of that. After a while, I said, "Do you...?
Is it that you don't want people to think of me as your sister?"

He looked horrified. "No, Lauren. It's not like that." He paused,
thought for a moment. "It's more like Marcus Olamina was my childhood
name. I'm not that kid anymore. I'll never be him again."

I nodded. "Okay." And then, "Thanks to Bankole, just about everyone here
calls me Olamina, so maybe it's just as well. Less confusing."

"Your husband calls you by your maiden name?"

"He doesn't like my first name, so he ignores it. That's fair. I didn't
like his first name either. It's Taylor, by the way, and I ignore it."

My brother shrugged. "Your business, I guess. Just call me Marcos."

I shrugged too. "All right," I said.

[WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER]{.small} 22, 2032

Bankole is home. He says the doctor in Halstead is dead, and the people
there---the mayor and town council---have asked him to move there and
become their doctor full time.

He wants to. For my sake and the baby's as well as his own, he wants to
more than anything. It's a chance that may not come his way again, he
says. He's an old man, he says. He's got to think of the future, and
I've got to think of the baby, he says. I've got to be realistic, for
god's sake, and stop dreaming, he says.

I'm not conveying the full flavor of this. It's the same old stuff. He's
said most of it before, and I'm damned tired of it. But it's worse now.
It's scarier. Bankole means it more than he ever has before because he
has an offer now---a real offer. And he means it because there is this
small new life between us, growing inside me. I've had no morning
sickness, none of the swellings and discomforts and moodiness that Zahra
has when she's pregnant. And yet, I don't doubt for a moment that my
daughter is within me. Bankole's checked, and he says she's a girl. In
gentler moments, we bicker about her name---Beryl like his mother or,
from my point of view, almost anything that isn't Beryl. Such an
old-fashioned name.

But sometimes all of the ease and the joy and the love that I feel
because of our child growing and developing within me seems lost on
Bankole. All he seems to see is what he calls my immaturity, my
irrational, unrealistic faith in Earthseed, my selfishness, my
shortsightedness.

she was a young wife and soon-to-be mother, when she was a friend, a
sister, and, incidentally, the local minister.**

**Should she have left Acorn and gone to live in Halstead as my father
asked? Of course she should have! And if she had, would she, my father,
and I have managed to have normal, comfortable lives through Jarret's
upheavals? I believe we would have. My father called her immature,
unrealistic, selfish, and shortsighted. Shortsighted, of all things! If
there are sins in Earthseed, shortsightedness, lack of forethought, is
the worst of them. And yet shortsighted is exactly what she was. She
sacrificed us for an idea. And if she didn't know what she was doing,
she should have known---she who paid so much attention to the news, to
the times and the trends. As an adolescent, she saw her father's error
when he could not see it---his dependence on walls and guns, religious
faith, and a hope that the good old days would return. Yet what more
than that did she have? If her good days were to be in the future on
some extra-solar world, that only made them more pathetically unreal.**

[SUNDAY, JANUARY]{.small} 16, 2033

People keep pet dogs in Halstead, as they do in most local cities and
towns.

I know that, but I grew up down south, where poor people and dogs didn't
run together. They ate one another. Dogs ran in packs, and they were one
of the things we were glad our walls kept out. Some of the very rich
used vicious dogs to guard their property. They were the only ones who
could afford to buy meat, then feed it to a dog. The rest of us, if we
got meat, were glad to eat it ourselves.

Even now, it startles me every time I see people and dogs together and
peaceful. But the people of local towns and family farms, while not
rich, have food enough to share with dogs---even dogs who do no work and
only lie around all day with their mouths open and their long, sharp
teeth showing. Children play with them. More than once in the past few
days, I've had to quell my impulse to snatch a child away from those
teeth and beat off the dog.

It's interesting to see that dogs don't like me any more than I like
them. We keep out of one another's way. Bankole, on the other hand,
likes dogs. He scratches their ears and talks to them. They like him.
When he was a boy down south, he kept two or three big ones as pets.
Hard to believe that people did that in San Diego or Los Angeles, even
thirty or forty years ago.

To please Bankole, I went with him into cold, windy Halstead for a
couple of days. I told him it would do no good, but he wanted me to go
anyway. I've pleased him so little recently that I agreed to go. He's in
love with the place. It's just what he wants: long established, yet
modern, familiar, and isolated. There are comfortable big houses---three
and four bedrooms. And, thanks to the wind turbines in the hills, along
the ridges, there's plenty of electricity most of the time. And there's
modern plumbing. We have a little of that now, but it's been a long
struggle. Halstead, except for its crumbling coastline, is about as well
protected as any town could be. Its population is about 250. That
includes the nearest farm families.

Bankole and I have been promised the home of a family who is
emigrating---going to homestead in Siberia. Two young-adult sons and the
husband of the family have already gone to prepare a place for the
women, the younger children, and the grandparents. For this family named
Cannon, Bankole's protected, promised land of Halstead is just one more
piece of the worn-out, unlivable "old country" that they want to leave
behind. They're nice people, but they can't wait to get out of the
United States. They say it just doesn't work anymore. The election of
Jarret was, for them, the last straw.

And yet the Halstead trip was a good experience for me. I don't get to
travel as much as I did before I got pregnant---no salvaging and not as
much trading. Bankole nags me to stay home and "behave myself," and most
of the time, I give in.

I had forgotten what living in a big modern house was like. Even the
cold and the wind weren't that bad. I kind of liked them. The house
rattled and creaked, but it was warmed both by electric heaters and by
fires in the fireplaces, and it was set far enough back from the coastal
bluffs to be in no danger for many years, if ever.

During the first day, I walked out to the bluffs and stood looking at
the Pacific Ocean. We can see the ocean every time we travel up the
highway to the Eureka-Arcata area and farther north. Up there, it has
washed away long stretches of sand dunes and done real damage along the
Humboldt and Arcata Bay coastlines. This is all the fault of the
steadily rising level of the sea and of occasional, severe storms.

But still, the sea is beautiful. I stood there in the buffeting wind,
staring out at the whitecaps and enjoying the sheer vastness of the
water. I didn't hear Bankole come up behind me until he was almost
beside me. That says something about how safe I felt. I'm more watchful
at home in Acorn.

Bankole put his arm around me, and the wind whipped his beard. He
smiled. "It is beautiful, isn't it?"

I nodded. "I wonder how people used to living here are going to like
living on the vast Siberian plains, even if the plains are warmer than
they once were."

He laughed. "When I was a boy, Siberia was a place where the
Russians---the Soviets, we called them then---sent people they thought
of as criminals and political troublemakers. If anyone then had said
that Americans would be giving up their homes and their citizenship and
going to make new lives in Siberia, the rest of us would have looked
around for a straitjacket for him."

"I suspect it's a human characteristic not to know when you're well
off," I said.

He glanced at me sidewise. "Oh, it is," he said. "I see it every day."

I laughed, wrapped an arm around him, and we went back to the Cannon
house to a meal of broiled fish, boiled potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and
baked apples. The Cannon house sits on a large lot, and, like Bankole
and I, the Cannons raise much of their own food. What they can't raise,
they buy from local farmers or fishermen. They're also part of a
cooperative that evaporates salt for their own use and for sale. But
unlike us, they use few wild foods or seasonings---no acorns, cactus
fruit, mint, manzanita, not even pine nuts. Surely there will be new
foods in Siberia. Would they learn to eat them or would they cling to
whatever they could grow or buy of their bland familiar foods?

"Sometimes I can't stand the thought of leaving this house," Thea Cannon
said as we sat eating. "But there'll be more opportunity for the
children when we leave. What is there for them here?"

I'm not so pregnant that most people notice, and I do wear loose
clothing now. But I did think that Thea Cannon, who has seven kids of
her own, would have noticed. Maybe she's just too wrapped up in her own
worries. She's a plump, pretty, tired-looking blond woman in her
forties, and she always seems a little distracted---as though she has a
lot on her mind.

That night, I lay awake beside Bankole, listening to the sounds of the
sea and the wind. They're good sounds as long as you don't have to be
outside. Back at Acorn, being on watch during rough weather is no joke.

"The mayor tells me the town is willing to hire you to replace one of
their teachers," Bankole said, his mouth near my ear and his hand on my
stomach where he likes to rest it. "They've got one teacher who's in her
late fifties and one who's 79. The older one has been wanting to retire
for years. When I told them that you had pretty much set up the school
at Acorn and that you taught there, they almost cheered."

"Did you tell them that all I've got is a high school education, a lot
of reading, and the courses I audited on my father's computer?"

"I told them. They don't care. If you can help their kids learn enough
to pass the high school equivalency tests, they'll figure you've earned
your pay. And by the way, they can't actually pay you much in hard
currency, but they're willing to let you go on living in the house and
raising food in the garden even after I'm dead."

I moved against him, but managed not to say anything. I hate to hear him
always talking about dying.

"Aside from the older teacher," he continued, "no one around here has a
teaching credential. The older people who do have college degrees *do
not* want second or third careers teaching school. Just install some
reading, writing, math, history, and science in these kids' heads, and
everyone will be happy. You should be able to do it in your sleep after
what you've had to put up with in Acorn."

"In my sleep," I said. "That sounds like one definition of life in
hell."

He took his hand off my stomach.

"This place is wonderful," I said. "And I love you for trying to provide
it for the baby and me. But there's nothing here but existence. I can't
give up Acorn and Earthseed to come here and install a dab of education
into kids who don't really need me."

"Your child will need you."

"I know."

He said nothing more. He turned over and lay with his back to me. After
a while I slept. I don't know whether he did.

Later, back at home, we didn't talk much. Bankole was angry and
unforgiving. He has not yet said a firm "No" to the people of Halstead.
That troubles me. I love him and I believed he loves me, but I can't
help knowing that he could settle in Halstead without me. He's a
self-sufficient man, and he truly believes he's right. He says I'm being
childish and stubborn.

Marc agrees with him, by the way, not that either of us has asked Marc
what he thinks. But he's still staying with us, and he can't help
hearing at least some of our disagreement. He could have avoided mixing
in, but I don't think that ever occurred to him.

"What's the matter with you?" he demanded of me this morning just before
Gathering. "Why do you want to have a baby in this dump? Just think, you
could live in a real house in a real town."

And I got so angry so fast that my only choices were either to be very
quiet or to scream at him. He, of all people should have known better
than to say such a thing. We had reached out from our *dump* with money
made at our *dump.* We had found him and freed him. But for us and our
dump, he would still be a slave and a whore!

"Come to Gathering," I said in almost a whisper. And I walked out of the
house away from him.

He followed me to Gathering, but he never apologized. I don't think he
ever realized that he had said something vile.

After Gathering, Gray Mora came up to me and said, "I hear you're
leaving."

I was surprised. I don't suppose I should have been. Bankole and I don't
scream at one another and broadcast our troubles the way the Figueroas
and the Faircloths do, but no doubt it's clear to everyone that there's
something wrong between us. And then there was Marc. He might tell
people---just out of a need to be important. He does have a consuming
need to be important, to reassert his manhood.

"I'm not leaving," I told Gray.

He frowned. "You sure? I heard you were moving to Halstead."

"I'm not leaving."

He drew in a long breath and let it out. "Good. This place would
probably go to hell without you." And he turned and walked away. That
was Gray. I thought back when he joined us that he might be trouble, or
that he wouldn't stay. Instead, he turned out to be dependability
itself---as long as you didn't want a lot of conversation or
demonstrative friendliness. If you were loyal to Gray and his family, he
was loyal to you.

Later, after dinner, Zahra Balter pulled me out of a set of dramatic
readings that three of the older kids were giving of their own work or
of published work that they liked. I was enjoying Gray's stepdaughter
Tori Mora's reading of some comic poetry that she had written. The more
laughter in Acorn, the better. And I was drawing Tori, tall and lean and
angular, a handsome girl rather than a pretty one. I had discovered that
drawing was so different from everything else I did that it relaxed me,
and at the same time, it roused me to a new alertness---a new kind of
alertness. I've begun to perceive color and texture, line and shape,
light and shadow with new intensity. I go into these focused, trancelike
states and draw really terrible stuff. My friends laugh at the drawings,
but they tell me they're getting better, getting recognizable. Zahra
told me a couple of weeks ago that a drawing I'd done of Harry looked
almost human.

But this time Zahra hadn't come to talk about my drawing.

"So you're going to leave!" she hissed at me as soon as we were alone.
She looked angry and bitter. Here and there around us, people found
their own Gathering Day amusements. May was teaching Mercy Noyer how to
weave a small basket from tree bark. A few adults and older kids had
gotten a soccer game going in spite of the cold. Marc and Jorge were out
there on opposite sides, having a great time running up and down the
field, getting filthy, and collecting more than their share of bruises.
Travis, who also loves soccer, has said, "I think those two would kill
each other for a chance to score."

If only Marc would confine himself to scoring in soccer.

Of course, I wasn't as surprised at Zahra's question as I had been at
Gray's. "Zee, I'm not leaving," I said.

Like Gray, she didn't believe me at first. "I heard you were. Your
brother said...Lauren, tell me the truth!"

"Bankole wants me to move to Halstead," I said. "You know that. I don't
want to go. I think we've got something worthwhile going here, and it's
ours."

"I heard they offered you a house by the ocean?"

"Within sight of the ocean, but not that close. You don't want to be too
close to the ocean in Halstead."

"But a real house, I mean. A house like back in Robledo."

"Yes."

"And you turned them down?"

"Yes."

"You're crazy as hell."

That did startle me. "You mean you want me to go, Zee?"

"Don't be stupid. You're the closest thing I got to a sister. You know
damned well I don't want you to go. But...you should go."

"I'm not."

"I would."

I stared at her.

"I'd go to a better place if I could. I got two kids. Where do they go
from here? Where's your little baby going from here?"

"Where would they go from Halstead? Halstead is like Robledo with a
better wall. Why do you think there are people there who are planning to
emigrate to Russia or Alaska and others who are just trying to hang on
to their little piece of the twentieth century until they die? None of
them is trying to build anything to replace what we've lost or to boost
us to something better."

"You mean like Earthseed? The Destiny?"

"Yes."

"It ain't enough."

"It's a beginning. It's a way of trying to build tomorrow instead of
cycling back into some form of yesterday."

"Do you ever stop preaching?"

"Am I wrong?"

She shrugged. "You know I'm not religious the way you are. Besides, even
if you go to Halstead, we'll still be here. And Earthseed will still be
Earthseed."

Would it? Maybe. But Earthseed is a young movement. I couldn't walk away
and leave it to a "maybe." I *wouldn't* walk away from it any more than
I'd walk away from the baby I would soon be having.

Someday, I want people to go from here and teach Earthseed. And I want
what they teach to still be recognizable as Earthseed.

"I'm not going," I said. "And, Zee, I think you're a liar. I don't think
you'd go either. You know that here at Acorn we're with you if you get
into trouble. And you know we would take care of your kids if anything
happened to you and Harry. Who else would do that?" She had been raised
in some of the nastier streets of Los Angeles, and she knew about
loyalty, about depending on her friends and having them depend on her.

She looked at me, then looked away. "It's good here," she said, staring
out toward the hills to the west of us. "It's better than I thought it
could be when we got here. But you know it's nothing like as good as we
had back in Robledo. For your baby's sake, you ought to go."

"For my baby's sake, I'm staying."

And she met my eyes again. "You sure? Think about the future."

"I'm sure. And you know damned well I am thinking about the future."

She was silent for a moment. Then she sighed. "Good." Another silence.
"You're right. I wouldn't want to go, and I wouldn't want you to go
either. Maybe that's because I'm as big a fool as you are. I don't know.
But...we do have something good here. Acorn and Earthseed---they're both
too good to let go of." She grinned. "How's Bankole dealing with
things?"

"Not well."

"No. He tries to give you what any sane woman would want and you don't
want it. Poor guy."

She went away, smiling. I was heading back to the reading and my sketch
pad when Jorge Cho came up to me, sweaty and filthy from the game. He
was with his girlfriend Diamond Scott, tiny and black and every hair in
place as usual. I saw the question on their faces before Jorge spoke.

"Is it true that you're leaving?"

[THURSDAY, JANUARY 20]{.small}, 2033

Jarret was inaugurated today.

We listened to his speech---short and rousing. Plenty of "America,
America, God shed his grace on thee," and "God bless America," and "One
nation, indivisible, under God," and patriotism, law, order, sacred
honor, flags everywhere, Bibles everywhere, people waving one of each.
His sermon---because that's what it was---was from Isaiah, Chapter One.
"Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land,
strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate as overthrown
by strangers."

And then, "Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though
your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be
red like crimson, they will be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient,
ye shall eat the good of the land. But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall
be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it."

Then, he spoke of peace, rebuilding and healing. "A strong Christian
America," he said, "needs strong Christian American soldiers to reunite,
rebuild, and defend it." In almost the same breath, he spoke of both
"the generosity and the love that we must show to one another, to all of
our fellow Christian Americans," and "the destruction we must visit upon
traitors and sinners, those destroyers in our midst."

I'd call it a fire-and-brimstone speech, but what happens now?

[SUNDAY, FEBRUARY]{.small} 6, 2033

Yesterday Marc told Bankole that he intended to hold services of his own
on Gathering Day. He would, he said, speak just before our regular
gathering. It seemed that he was remembering his time with the Durans in
Robledo, remembering his carport church, and wanting to recapture that
image of himself.

Bankole sent him to me. "Don't go out of your way to make trouble,"
Bankole told him. "Your sister has been good to you. Tell her what you
intend to do."

"She can't stop me!" my brother said.

"Do what's right," Bankole told him. "You have a conscience. Don't go
behind your sister's back."

So later in the day, Marc found me sitting with Channa Ryan, sorting and
cataloging books. We're always behind in that, and it needs to be done.
All of our kids work on projects as part of their education. Each kid
does at least one group project and one individual project per year.
Most kids find the two unrelated projects influencing one another in
unexpected ways. This helps the kids begin to learn how the world works,
how all sorts of things interact and influence one another. The kids
begin to teach themselves and one another. They begin to learn how to
learn. With their mentors' help, they each choose some aspect of
history, science, math, art, or whatever and learns it well enough to
teach it. Then they do just that. They teach it. To do a good job, they
need to be able to find out what information we have available here and
what they're going to have to go to the nets for. Since we aren't rich
yet, the more we can offer them from our own library, the better.

Still, cataloging is tedious. I was almost glad when Marc came and
interrupted my work. He and I went outside to talk.

"I want to get back to what I really care about," he said as we sat
together on a handsome bench that Allie Gilchrist had made. Allie's
discovered a real liking for building furniture, and she's worked as
hard to learn to do it well as she has to learn to assist Bankole well.

"What?" I asked Marc, hoping that what he wanted was something that we
could accommodate. No one wanted more than I did for him to find his own
interests and get into work that he cared about.

"I want to start my church again," he said. "I want to preach. I'm not
asking your permission. I'm just letting you know. With Jarret in
office, you need someone like me anyway so that you'll be able to say
you're not a Satanist cult."

I sighed. All of a sudden I could feel myself all but sagging with
weariness and dread. But I only said, "If Jarret noticed us and wanted
to call us a Satanic cult, your preaching wouldn't stop him. Would you
be willing to speak *at* Gathering?"

That surprised him. "You mean while you're having your services?"

"Yes."

"I won't talk about Earthseed. I want to preach."

"Preach, then."

"What's the catch?"

"You should know. You've been to our services. You choose the topic. You
say what you want. But afterward there will be questions and
discussion."

"I'm not out to teach a class. I want to preach a sermon."

"That's not our way, Marc. If you speak, you have to face questions and
discussion. You need to be ready for that. Besides, no matter what you
call it, a good sermon is just a lesson that you're trying to teach."

"But...you won't try to get in the way of my preaching at the Gathering
if I take questions afterward?"

"That's right."

"Then I'll do it."

"It's no joke, Marc."

"I know. It's no joke to me either."

"I mean we're as serious about the discussion as you are about the
sermon. Some of our people might probe and dissect in ways you won't
like."

"Okay, I can handle it."

No, I didn't think he could. But an unpleasant thing should be done
quickly if it must be done at all. My brother had a sermon ready. He'd
been working on it in his spare moments. Since I was scheduled to speak
at the Gathering this morning, I was able to step aside for him, let him
speak at once.

He didn't pull his punches. He confronted us, challenged us directly
from the Bible---first from Isaiah again, "The grass withereth, the
flower fadeth; but the word of our God will stand for ever." Then later
from Malachi, "For I am the Lord. I change not." And then from Hebrews,
"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and for ever. Be not
carried about with diverse and strange doctrines."

Marc doesn't have our father's impressive voice, and he knows it. He
uses what he has skillfully, and, of course, it helps that he's so
good-looking. But once he had preached his sermon on the changelessness
of God, Jorge Cho spoke up. Jorge was next to Diamond Scott as usual. He
has told me he intends to marry Di, but Di has been looking at my
brother in a way that Jorge doesn't like at all. There's a rivalry
between Marc and Jorge anyway. They're both young and competitive.

"We believe that all things change," Jorge said, "even though all things
don't necessarily change in all ways. Why do you believe God doesn't
change?"

My brother smiled. "But even you believe that your God doesn't change.
Your God promotes change, but he stays the same."

That surprised me. Marc shouldn't have made such avoidable mistakes.
He's had plenty of time to read, talk, and hear about Earthseed, but
somehow, he's misunderstood.

Travis was the first to point out the error. "God is Change," he said.
"God *promotes* nothing. Nothing at all."

And Zahra, of all people, said, "Our God isn't male. Change has no sex.
Marc, you don't know enough about us yet even to criticize us."

Jorge began repeating his question before Zahra had finished. "Why do
you think your God doesn't change? How can you prove it?"

"I have faith that it's true," Marc said. "Belief must be based on faith
as much as on proofs."

"But there must be some test," Jorge said. "You must have a way to know
when your faith is sensible and when it makes no sense."

"The test is the Bible, of course. When the Bible tells us
something---in this case, it tells us several times---we can believe it.
We can have faith that it is true."

Antonio Cortez, Lucio's oldest nephew, jumped in. "Look," he said, "in
the Bible, God does things. Things happen and he reacts. He makes
things. He gets angry. He destroys things...."

"But he, himself, doesn't change," my brother said.

"Oh, come on," Tori Mora shouted in open disgust. "To take action is to
change. It's to go from action to inaction. And he goes from calmness to
anger---he gets angry a lot. And---"

"And in Genesis," her stepsister Doe said, "he lets some of his favorite
men have children with their sisters or daughters. Then in Leviticus and
Deuteronomy, he says anyone who does that should be killed."

"Right," Jorge said. "I was just reading that last week. It is no good
to say that something is true because the Bible says it is true and then
forget that a few pages later, the Bible says---or shows---something
completely different."

"Every time any god is accepted by a new group of people, that god
changes," Harry Balter said.

"I think," Marta Figueroa Castro said in her gentlest voice, "that the
verses you read, Marc, mean that God is always God, always there for us,
always dependable that way. And, of course, it means that God and God's
word will never die."

"Yes, so much of the Bible is metaphor," Diamond Scott said. She, too,
spoke very gently. "I remember that my mother used to try to take it
absolutely literally, but it just meant she had to ignore some things
and twist others." Beside her, Jorge smiled.

The discussion went on for a while longer. Then other people began to
take pity on Marc. They let him end the discussion. They had never been
out to humiliate him. Well, maybe Jorge had, but even Jorge had been
polite. Things would have gone better for Marc if he had done his
homework, and things would have been more interesting and involving for
his audience. He might even have won over a Faircloth or a Peralta. I
had worried about that.

The truth is, I let him speak today because I wanted him to speak before
he was truly ready. I wish I hadn't had to do that. I wish he had wanted
to do something else---anything else---to get his self-respect back and
begin to rebuild himself. I have tried to interest him in the several
kinds of work we do here. He isn't lazy. He pulls his weight. But he
doesn't like fieldwork or working with animals or trading or teaching or
salvaging or carpentry. He tried repairing salvaged tools, but it
bothered him that he had so much to learn even about simple things. He
all but ruined a pair of heavy-duty shears that he was supposed to be
sharpening. He tried to grind their almost square edges to thin, sharp
blades, and Travis gave him the chewing out he deserved.

"If you don't know, *ask*," Travis had shouted. "Nobody expects you to
know everything. Just ask! This shit is easy to do if you just take the
trouble to learn a few basics. Work with me for a while. Don't try to go
off on your own."

But my brother needed to "go off on his own," to have his own turf where
he was the one who said yes or no, and where everyone respected him. He
needed that more than he needed anything, and he meant to have it all at
once.

But now, instead of feeling important and proud, he feels angry and
embarrassed. I had to let him inflict those feelings on himself. I
couldn't let him begin to divide Acorn. More important---much more
important---I couldn't let him begin to divide Earthseed.

From EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

**To make peace with others,**

**Make peace with yourself:**

**Shape God With generosity**

**And compassion.**

**Minimize harm.**

**Shield the weak.**

**Treasure the innocent.**

**Be true to the Destiny.**

**Forgive your enemies.**

**Forgive yourself.**

**M[Y MOTHER WAS QUITE]{.small} open in her journal about the fact that
she didn't know what she was doing, and that this was a terrible
frustration to her. She meant to make Earthseed a nationwide movement,
but she had no idea how to do this. She seemed to have vague plans to
someday send out Earthseed missionaries, to use Acorn as a kind of
school for such missionaries. Perhaps this is what she would have done
if she'd had the chance. It might even have worked. It's worked for
other cults. It might have gained her a larger following, more
recognition.**

**But she didn't want simple recognition. She wanted people to
*believe.* She had a truth that she wanted to teach and an outer-space
Destiny that she wanted taken seriously and someday fulfilled. And it's
obvious from her treatment of Uncle Marc that she was very territorial
about the whole thing. I don't know whether Uncle Marc ever realized how
she set him up to fail and to make a bad first impression with her
people. Such a simple, subtle thing. He imagined that she had done
something much more obvious and complicated.**

**She didn't fight people unless she was pretty sure she was going to
win. When she wasn't sure, she found ways to avoid fighting or go along
with her opponents until they tripped themselves up or put themselves in
a position for her to trip them up. Smart, I suppose---or treacherous,
depending on your point of view.**

**She learned from everyone and everything. I think if I had died at
birth, she would have managed to learn something from my death that
would be useful to Earthseed.**

[SATURDAY, FEBRUARY]{.small} 19, 2033

I feel more strongly than I ever have that there will soon be war.
President Jarret is still stirring up bad feelings over Alaska, or as he
describes it, "our truant forty-ninth state." He paints Alaska's
President Leontyev and the Alaskan legislature as the real enemies---as
"that gang of traitors and thieves who are trying to steal a vast, rich
portion of these *United* States for themselves. These people want to
treat all of Alaska as their own personal, private property. Can we let
them get away with it? Can we let them cheat us, rob us, destroy our
country, use our sacred constitution as waste paper? Can we forget that
'If a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand?' Jesus
Christ spoke those words 2000 years ago. President Abraham Lincoln
paraphrased them in 1858. Was Lincoln wrong? Was---dare we ask it? Dare
we imagine it? Was Christ wrong? Was our Lord, wrong?"

He's so good at asking nasty rhetorical questions---so good at
encouraging young men---not young women, only men---to "Do your duty, to
your country and to yourselves. Prove yourselves men worthy to be called
good Christian American soldiers. Serve your country, now that it has
such great need of you." They're to do all this by joining the armed
services. I've never heard a president talk this way---although I have
read about presidents and leaders of other nations who talked this way
when they were preparing for war. Jarret said nothing about drafting
people, but Bankole says that may be next. Bankole was down in
Sacramento a couple of days ago, and he says a lot of people think it's
"time we taught that bunch of traitors up in Alaska a lesson."

It shouldn't be so easy to nudge people toward what might be their own
destruction.

"Who was doing the talking?" I asked him as he unpacked medical
supplies. He keeps most of his supplies in our cabin until they're
needed at the clinic. That way they're less likely to tempt children or
thieves. "I mean, was it most of the people you talked to or just a
few?"

"Mostly men," he said. "Some young and some old enough to know better. I
think a lot of the younger ones would like a war. War is exciting. A boy
can prove himself, become a man---if he lives. He'll be given a gun and
trained to shoot people. He'll be a powerful part of a powerful team.
Chances are, he won't think about the people who'll be shooting back at
him, bombing him, or otherwise trying to kill him until he faces them."

I thought about the young single men of Acorn---Jorge Cho, Esteban
Peralta, Antonio Figueroa, and even my brother Marc, and shook my head.
"Did you ever want to go to war?" I asked.

"Never," Bankole answered. "I wanted to be a healer. I was damned
idealistic about it. Believe me, that was a daunting enough challenge
for a young Black boy in the late twentieth century---much harder than
learning to kill. It never occurred to me back in the 1990s when I was
in medical school that in spite of my ideals, I would have to learn to
do both."

[MONDAY, FEBRUARY]{.small} 28, 2033

Marc spoke at Gathering yesterday. This is the third time he's done it.
Each time he learns more about Earthseed and tries harder to convince us
that our beliefs are nonsense. He seems to have decided that the unity,
the Christianity and the hope that Jarret has brought to the country
makes Jarret not the monster we all feared but a potential savior. The
country, he tells us, must get back to God or it is finished.

"The Earthseed Destiny," he said yesterday, "is an airy nothing. The
country is bleeding to death in poverty, slavery, chaos, and sin. This
is the time for us to work for our salvation, not to divert our
attention to fantasy explorations of extrasolar worlds."

Travis, trying to explain, said, "The Destiny is important for the
lessons it forces us to learn while we're here on Earth, for the people
it encourages us to become. It's important for the unity and purpose
that it gives us here on Earth. And in the future, it offers us a kind
of species adulthood and species immortality when we scatter to the
stars."

My brother laughed. "If you're looking for immortality in outer space,"
he said, "you've been misled. You already have an immortal soul, and
where that soul spends eternity is up to you. Remember the Tower of
Babel! You can follow Earthseed, build your way to go to the stars, fall
down into chaos, and wind up in hell! Or you can follow the will of God.
And if you follow God's will, you can live forever, secure and happy, in
God's true heaven."

Zahra Balter, loyal in spite of her personal beliefs, spoke up before I
could. "Marc," she said, "if we have immortal souls, don't you think
we'll take them with us even if we go to the stars?"

"Why do you find it so easy," Michael Kardos asked, "to believe we go to
heaven after we die, but so hard to believe we can go into the heavens
while we're alive? Following the Earthseed Destiny is difficult.
Massively difficult. That's the challenge. But if we want to do it,
someday we'll do it. It's not impossible."

I had spoken the same words to him shortly after he came to live at
Acorn. He had said then with bitter contempt that the Destiny was
meaningless. All he wanted to do, he said, was to earn enough money to
house, feed, and clothe his family. Once he was able to do that, he
said, then maybe he'd have time for science fiction.

Indeed.

[SUNDAY, MARCH]{.small} 6, 2033

Marc has gone.

He left yesterday with the Peraltas. They're gone for good too. They
were the ones Marc managed to reach. They've always felt that we should
be more Christian and more patriotic. They say Andrew Jarret is our
elected leader---Ramiro Peralta and his daughter Pilar helped elect
him---and a minister of God, so he deserves our respect. Esteban Peralta
is going to enlist in the army. He believes---the whole family
believes---it's our patriotic duty, everyone's duty, to support Jarret
in his "heroic" effort to revive and reunify the country. They don't
believe Jarret's a fascist. They don't believe that the church burnings,
witch burnings, and other abuses are Jarret's doing. "Some of his
followers are young and excitable," Ramiro Peralta says. "Jarret will
put their asses into uniform. Then they'll learn some discipline. Jarret
hates all this chaos the way I hate it. That's why I voted for him. Now
he'll start putting things right!"

It's true that there haven't been any burnings or beatings since Jarret
was inaugurated---or none that I've heard of, and I've been paying
attention to the news. I don't know what this means, but I don't believe
it means everything's all right. I don't think the Peraltas believe it
either. I think they're just scared, and getting out of any potential
line of fire. If Jarret does crack down on people who don't fit into his
religious notions, they don't want to be here at Acorn.

My brother on the other hand, used to despise Jarret. Now he says Jarret
is just what America needs. And I'm afraid that it's me he's begun to
despise. He blames me for the failure of his Gathering Day sermons. He's
gained no followers. The Peraltas like him and sort of agree with him.
Pilar Peralta is more than half in love with him, but even they don't
see him as a minister. They see him as a nice boy. In fact, that's the
way most people here in Acorn see him. He thinks this is my fault. He
believes, he insists, that I coached people to attack and humiliate him
at all three Gatherings. And he says with a weary, irritating, *honest*
smile, "I forgive you. I might have done the same thing to protect my
turf if I had any turf to protect."

I think it was the smile that made me say more than I should have. "The
truth is," I told him, "you were given a special privilege. If you were
anyone else, you could have been expelled for preaching another belief
system. I let you do it because you've been through so much hell, and I
knew it was important to you. And because you're my brother." I would
have called back the words if I could have. He would hear pity in them.
He would hear condescension.

For a long moment, he stared at me. I watched him get angry---very
angry. Then he seemed to push his anger away. He refused to react to it.
He shrugged.

"Think of the Gatherings you've attended," I said to him. "Name even one
that didn't involve questions, challenges, argument. It's our way. I did
warn you. Anyone can be questioned on any subject they choose to teach
or advocate. I told you that we were serious about it. We learn at least
as much by discussion as by lecture, demonstration, or experience."

"Forget about it," he said. "It's done. I don't blame you. Really. I
shouldn't have tried my hand here. I'll make a place for myself
somewhere else."

Still no anger expressed. Yet he was furious. He wouldn't show it and he
wouldn't talk about it, but it came off him like heat. Perhaps that's
what a collar teaches---a horrible kind of self-control. Or perhaps not.
My brother was always a self-contained person. He knew how to be
unreachable.

I sighed and gave him as much money as I could afford, plus a rifle, a
sidearm, and ammunition for both. He's not a very good shot with
anything yet, but he knows the basics, and I couldn't let him go out and
wind up in the hands of someone like Cougar again. The Peralta family
had been with us for two years, so they had money and possessions as a
result of their work with us. Marc did not. We drove him and the
Peraltas into Eureka. There, they might find homes and jobs, or at least
they might find temporary shelter until they could decide what to do.

"I thought you knew me," I said to my brother just before he left us. "I
wouldn't do what you're accusing me of."

He shrugged. "It's okay. Don't keep worrying about it." He smiled. And
he was gone.

I don't know how to feel about this. So many people have come here and
stayed or wanted to stay even if, for some reason, they couldn't. I had
to expel a thief a year ago, and he cried and begged to stay. We had
caught him stealing drugs from Bankole's medical supplies, so he had to
go, but he cried.

As they left us, even the Peraltas looked grim and frightened. They were
Ramiro, the father; Pilar, 18; Esteban, 17; and Eva, who was only two
and whose birth at a rest stop along the highway had cost her mother's
life. They had no other relatives left alive, no friends outside of
Acorn who would help them if they got into trouble. And Esteban would be
leaving them soon to enlist. They had good reason to look worried.

Marc would be in the same situation once he left us. Worse, he would be
all alone. Yet he smiled.

I don't know whether I'll ever see him again. I feel almost as though
he's died...died again.

[THURSDAY, MARCH]{.small} 17, 2033

Dan Noyer found his way back to us last night.

He came back. Amazing. I think he's been gone longer than he was with
us. We tried to find him---for his little sisters' sakes as much as for
his. But unless you have the money to hire a small army of private cops
like that guy in Texas, finding people in today's chaos is almost
impossible. My finding Marcus was an accident. Anyway, Dan came home on
his own, poor boy.

It was a cold night. We had all gone to bed except for the first watch
of the night.

The watchers were Gray Mora and Zahra Balter.

Zahra was the one who spotted the intruders. As she described it to me
later, she saw two people running, staggering, sometimes seeming to hold
one another up. If not for the staggering, Zahra might have fired a
warning shot, at least. But before she revealed herself, she wanted to
see who or what the runners were escaping from.

As she scanned the hills behind them, she tapped out our emergency
signal on her phone.

There were five people chasing the staggering runners---or, with her
night-vision glasses, she could see five. She kept looking for more.

One of the five shouted, then fell, and Zahra realized that that one
must have blundered into the edge of our thorn fence. In the dark, some
of our thorn bushes don't look that savage. They're pretty if you don't
touch them. Some will even be covered with flowers soon. But they grab
clothing and flesh, and they tear.

The injured one's four companions slowed, seemed to hesitate, then sped
up again as the injured one limped after them.

Zahra put her rifle on automatic and fired a short burst across the path
of the two front runners. They stopped short and dived into the thorn
bushes and cactuses. One began to fire in Zahra's general direction.
There were shouts of pain and loud curses. Then all five were shooting.
Down in Acorn, we could hear the gunfire. Even without the phone, we
would have known that it was coming from the area around Zahra's watch
station.

Zahra and Harry are my oldest friends, and I'm Change-sister to them and
Change-aunt to their kids Tabia and Russell. For that reason, I paid no
attention to Bankole when he told me to stay in the house. I remember
thinking that if this were another Dovetree-like raid, staying inside
was only asking to burn.

But this didn't sound like what happened at Dovetree. It wasn't loud
enough. There weren't enough attackers. This sounded like a small gang
raid of a kind we hadn't had for years.

Bankole and I slipped out of the house together and headed for the
truck. For most of the run, we were protected by the bulk first of our
own cabin, then of the school. I suppose that's why Bankole didn't try
as hard as he might have to make me stay behind. We couldn't be seen,
let alone shot at. We keep the truck parked in its own space on the
south side of the school. It's protected there in the center of the
community, and during the day we can spread its solar wings and let it
recharge its batteries.

Harry Balter reached the truck just as Bankole and I got there. He
opened a side door, and all three of us scrambled in.

Harry and I have gotten comfortable with the truck's computers. In our
earlier lives down south, we both used our parents' computers. We're
unusual. Most adults at Acorn had never touched or even seen a computer
before. Still others are afraid of them. For now, although we're passing
on our knowledge, we're still among the few who take full advantage of
what the truck can do with its weapons, maneuverability, and sensory
systems.

We turned everything on, and Bankole drove us toward Zahra's current
watch station. As we rode, we used the truck's infrared viewer to locate
each of the intruders. Bankole is a good, steady driver, and he has
confidence in the truck's armor. It didn't seem to bother him at all
that people were shooting at us. In fact, it was a good thing the
intruders were wasting ammunition on us. That gave Zahra some relief.

Then we had a look around, and we decided that one of the intruders was
much too close to Zahra---and creeping closer. He could have been trying
to get away, but he wasn't. None of them were. We made sure the targets
we had identified were, in fact, targets, and not our own people. Once
we were sure, we pointed them out to the truck and let it open up on
them. Along with the trucks ability to "see" in the dark via infrared,
ambient light, or radar, it also has very good "hearing," and an
incorrectly designated sense of "smell." This last is based on
spectroscopic analysis rather than on actual smelling, but it is a kind
of chemical analysis over a distance. It could be used on anything that
emitted or reflected electromagnetic radiation---light---of some kind.

And the truck had plenty of memory. It could, and had, recorded all that
it could of each of us---our voices, hand and foot prints, retinal
prints, body sounds, and our general shapes in several positions to help
it recognize us and not shoot us.

When the truck began shooting, I left the forward monitors to Harry. I
didn't need to see anything that might make me useless, and the truck
didn't need any more help from me. Once we were between Zahra and the
attackers, I checked Zahra on an aft screen. She was alive and still at
her station. Most of her body was concealed within the depression and
behind the stone shelter that was intended to shield her. Some distance
away, Gray Mora was still at his station and still alive. He wasn't
involved in this, and his duty was to hold his position and guard the
other most likely approach to Acorn. It had taken a while for us to
learn not to be distracted by people who might rattle the front door
while their friends slipped in through the back.

The intruder nearest to Zahra was dead. According to the truck, he was
no longer changing the chemistry of the air in his immediate vicinity in
a way that indicated breathing, and he wasn't moving. Once the truck was
stopped, its ability to detect motion was as good as its hearing. Put
the two together and we could detect breathing and heartbeat---or their
absence. We've tried to trick it---fool it into mistaking one of us
playing dead for an actual corpse---and we've never been able to. That's
comforting.

"All right," Harry said, looking up from his screen. "How's Zee?"

"Alive," I told him. "Are all the shooters down?"

"Down and dead, all five of them." He drew a deep breath. "Bankole,
let's go pick up Zahra."

"Has anyone given Gray an all-clear?" I asked.

"I have," Bankole answered. "You know, I've got the next watch. In
another hour, I would have relieved Zahra."

"For the rest of the night," I said, "whoever's on duty should watch
from the truck. Whoever these guys are, they might have friends."

Bankole nodded.

He stopped us as close to Zahra's watch station as the truck could get.
We all took one more look around, then Harry opened the door. Before we
could call her, Zahra darted from cover and jumped into the truck. She
was bleeding from the left side of her face and neck, and that took me
by surprise. At once, I felt pain in my own face and neck, but managed
not to react. Habit. Harry grabbed Zahra and yelled for Bankole.

"I'm okay," Zahra said. "I just got hit by broken rock when those guys
were shooting. There was rock flying everywhere."

I went up to take Bankole's place, and he went back to check on her. I'm
a pretty decent driver now, so I got us back to the houses. "I'll take
what's left of Zahra's watch," I said. "Your watch, too, Bankole. I
think you're going to be busy."

"Watch from the truck!" Bankole ordered as though I hadn't just made the
same suggestion myself.

"Of course."

"Whatever happened to the two people those gunmen were chasing?" Zahra
asked.

We all looked at her.

"They were staggering toward Acorn," she said. "They couldn't have
gotten far. I didn't shoot them. They were already hurt."

This was the first we knew of the running pair. Zahra thought they were
both wounded, and both men. Yet we hadn't spotted them. Of course, we
hadn't looked back toward Acorn for more intruders. I hadn't even used
the aft screens to do that. Stupid of me.

We looked around Acorn now, and found the usual signs of life---plenty
of heat and some sound from the houses. The people were no doubt
watching, but in the middle of the night, they wouldn't come rushing out
until they got an all-clear from us. The older kids would be keeping an
eye on the younger ones, and the adults would be watching us. No one was
showing a light or moving around where they could be seen. The only loud
sound was that of a baby crying from the Douglas house. Even that came
to an abrupt stop.

If this had been a drill, it would have been a good drill.

But where were the two runners? Were they hiding? Had they found their
way into the school or into one of the houses? Were they crouching
behind one of the trees?

Were they armed?

"I don't think they had guns," Zahra said when I asked her.

Then I spotted them---or spotted something. I drove toward it, toward
our own cabin, in fact---Bankole's and mine.

"The truck says they're still alive," I said. "They're not moving much,
and Zee's right. They're not armed. But they're alive."

The runners were Dan Noyer and a young girl. The moment I saw her---tall
like Dan, but slender, pretty, dark-haired with a sharp little chin like
Mercy's---I knew she must be one of Dan's sisters. As it turned out, she
was Nina Noyer.

Both brother and sister had been beaten bloody with both fists, and with
something else. Bankole says they look as though they've been lashed
with whips.

"I suppose," he said with great bitterness, "that people who don't have
access to convict collars might have to exert themselves---resort to
older methods of torture."

Brother and sister have rope burns at their wrists, ankles, and necks.
Also, Bankole says, they've suffered a great deal of sexual abuse. The
girl told him they were forced "to do it with strangers for money." Dan
has endured even more beating than Nina has, and both have what Bankole
calls, "the usual infections and tissue damage." Nina says she got
pregnant, but one night during her captivity, she had a miscarriage. She
hadn't known what was happening, but one of the other slaves told her.
Well, I suppose it would be surprising if she hadn't gotten pregnant.
For her sake, I'm glad she miscarried.

And Dan had somehow found her, rescued her, and brought her home in
spite of pursuers chasing him right down into our valley. How had one
15-year-old done so very much?

And in the end, what would it cost him? In the end, did that matter?

[FRIDAY, MARCH]{.small} 18, 2033

"This is no way to live," Bankole said to me when he came in from
tending Dan and Nina this morning. He sat at the table and put his head
down on his arms.

I had taken his watch, as I promised, to free him to do what he could
for Dan and Nina. Allie and May were helping him, since they have all
but joined the Noyer family by taking care of Kassia and Mercy for so
long.

Bankole had spent most of his time with his two patients, and had once
again found himself fighting for Dan's life. The boy stopped breathing
twice, and Bankole revived him. But at last, the young body, once strong
and healthy, just gave up. It had taken an incredible amount of abuse
over the past few months.

"His heart just quit," Bankole said. "If I had more modern equipment,
maybe....Goddamnit, Olamina, can you see now why I need to get out of
here and get you out of here?"

"He's really dead?" I whispered, not believing it---not wanting to
believe it.

"He's dead. It's obscene! A young boy like that."

"What about his sister?"

"She wasn't as badly beaten as he was. I believe she'll be all right."

Would she, after all that had happened? I doubted it. Bankole and I sat
silent for a while, each of us thinking our own thoughts. What would it
have meant to Dan that he had saved his sister, even though he had not
been able to save himself? Did he ever imagine such a thing? Would it
somehow have been all right? Enough?

"Where's the other sister---Paula?" I asked. "What happened to her?"

Bankole sighed. "Dead. Some trouble on the road up north around
Trinidad. Three men tried to steal her. They got caught. Her owners and
the thieves shot it out, and she was in the middle. Nina says her owners
just cursed her for getting in the way and getting killed. They left her
body lying among the rocks by the sea. Nina said Paula loved the sea
when the family saw it for the first time last year. She said she hoped
the tide came in and carried her away."

I shook my head. Bankole got up and went to lie on the bed.

"But Dan did it," I said more to myself than to him. "He found his
sister, and he brought her home. It was *impossible*, but he did it!"

"Shit," Bankole said, and turned his face to the wall.

Now the long day is over.

We've cleaned up the hillside battlefield and thrown ground pepper over
parts of it so that any smell of blood that still clings to it wouldn't
hold the attention of wild dogs.

We've collected the dead, searched their bodies, then after dark,
surrounded them with scrap wood, soaked them in lamp oil, and burned
them. We do a thorough job, and the smoke is less noticeable at
night---less of a lure to scavengers and to the curious.

I hate doing this---burning the dead. Of course, whether they're our
dead or someone else's, it has to be done, but I hate it. We burned Dan
separate from his attackers. I set his pyre alight myself. Allie chose
the verse and spoke it. We'll have a full service for Dan when Nina is
well enough to attend. For now, though, I think Allie made a good
choice.

*"As wind,*

*As water,*

*As fire,*

*As life,*

*God*

*Is both creative and destructive,*

*Demanding and yielding,*

*Sculptor and clay.*

*God*

*Is Infinite Potential.*

*God*

*Is Change."*

The other dead---the intruders---were four men and a woman, all in their
twenties or early thirties. They were dirty and scratched up, but
well-dressed, well-armed, well-heeled. They had plenty of Canadian money
in their pockets. Were they slavers? Drug dealers? Thieves? Rich kids
slumming? Even Nina wasn't sure. She and Dan had escaped from their
original captors and had been on the highway, headed for Acorn when this
new group spotted them and came after them.

The intruders weren't carrying identification or even a change of
clothing. That means they had homes or a base of some kind nearby. We
thought about that and decided to burn their clothing along with their
bodies. It's of much better quality than our own---newer, more
fashionable, and more expensive. If we wear it, it might be recognized
at one of the street markets. And another thing. Two of the intruders
were wearing black sweatshirts with white crosses embroidered on
them---embroidered, not printed. These weren't the long tunics that
Aubrey Dovetree mentioned, but they were interesting imitations. The
intruders were thugs of some kind who had decided it was fashionable to
look like Jarret's people.

The intruders' guns are, like our own, good-quality, well-cared-for
automatic rifles with laser sites. One is German, one's American, and
the three newest are Russian. They're all as illegal as hell and as
common as oranges. We'll hide them in our survival caches scattered
through the mountains. The only thing they had that we'll keep with us
and use, as we need it, is some of their money. Most of that will go in
the caches too. It's all worn and wrinkled and not identifiable. The
fact that there's so much of it---more per person than any group of us
would carry around---tells us that these people were either rich or
involved in some profitable illegal activity, or both.

Well, now they're gone. People vanish in this world. Even rich people
out for fun and greater profit vanish. It happens all the time.

From EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

**We can,**

**Each of us,**

**Do the impossible**

**As Long as we can convince ourselves**

**That it has been done before.**

**L[IFE AT ACORN INVOLVED]{.small} a lot of hard physical work. It says
a great deal about the world of the early 2030s that most of the people
who stumbled onto the community chose to join Earthseed and stay. That
being the case, it must have taken a lot to get the Peralta family to
leave. There may have been more reasons than my mother gives for their
leaving, but I haven't been able to find evidence of them. Perhaps the
Peraltas actually did disagree with the religious and political feelings
of the rest of Acorn. Perhaps also, they were afraid of the way the
political situation in the country was going. They had reason to be.**

**On the other hand, I'm not at all surprised that Uncle Marc left.
There really was no place for him at Acorn. He was "Olamina's little
brother" or, as my mother said, a nice boy. He could have married and
begun a family in one more little cabin. That would have been
intolerable to him. He was a world saver, after all, like my mother. Or
not like her, since Earth was the only world that interested him. Like
the Peraltas, he was in religious and political disagreement with Acorn,
and, like the Peraltas, he was probably wise to leave when he did.**

**I got the impression that my mother didn't pay much attention to being
pregnant. It wasn't that she resented it. There's no indication that she
did. She simply ignored it. I was due in July. Between running out into
the firefight with the thugs who chased Dan and Nina Noyer and actually
giving birth to me, she worked hard to increase both Acorn's wholesaling
and its retailing businesses. She was so successful at this that by the
time I was born, the community was in the process of negotiating to buy
another truck. They did eventually buy it. Most people had been nervous
about having only the one truck. Travis and his helpers had kept the old
housetruck running well, and hadn't had to spend much money on it since
they made repairs themselves, but one major accident would put the whole
community out of business---or at least out of its new businesses.**

**With two trucks, the beginnings of a fleet, my mother was looking
forward to what she saw as a pleasant, reasonably secure future. She
began to think less about Acorn and more about Earthseed---about
spreading Earthseed to whole groups of new people. She wrote more than
once in her journal that she hoped to use missionaries to make
conversions in nearby cities and towns and to build whole new Earthseed
communities---clones of Acorn. I think she especially liked this last
idea. She even imagined names for the Acorn clones like a girl thinking
up names for imaginary children that she hopes to have someday. There
was a Hazelnut, a Pine, a Manzanita, a Sunflower, an Almond...."They
should be small communities," she said. "No more than a few hundred
people, never more than a thousand. A community whose population grew to
more than a thousand should split and 'parent' a new community."**

**In small communities, she believed, people are more accountable to one
another. Serious misbehavior is harder to get away with, harder even to
begin when everyone who sees you knows who you are, where you live, who
your family is, and whether you have any business doing what you're
doing.**

**My mother was not a fanciful woman apart from her belief in Earthseed.
That, I think, was why the people of Acorn trusted her so. She was
practical, straightforward, fair, honest, and she liked people. She
enjoyed working with them. She was a better-than-average community
leader. But beneath it all was always Earthseed and a longing, an
obsession, that was far stronger than anyone seemed to realize. People
who are intelligent, ambitious, and at the same time, in the grip of odd
obsessions can be dangerous. When they occur, they inevitably upset
things.**

**In *The First Book of the Living,* my mother says,**

> ***Prodigy is, in its essence, adaptability and persistent, positive
> obsession. Without persistence, what remains is an enthusiasm of the
> moment. Without adaptability, what remains may be channeled into
> destructive fanaticism. Without positive obsession, there is nothing
> at all.***

[FROM]{.small} *The Journals of Lauren Oya Olamina*

[FRIDAY, JULY]{.small} 22, 2033

On July 20, I turned 24. More important, on that day my daughter Larkin
Beryl Ife Olamina Bankole was born.

We've named her all that, poor little one. "Larkin" is from the same
root as "Lauren" and my father's name, "Laurence." All three names
derive from "Laurel" and that from the ancient Greek habit of rewarding
the victorious by crowning them with wreaths of laurel leaves. And there
is a pleasant similarity between "Larkin" and "lark," the name of a
songbird that neither Bankole nor I have ever seen or heard, but whose
voice, we have read, is beautiful. I had planned to call our daughter
Larkin even before she was born on my and my father's birthday. What a
lovely connection. Three generations of beginning on July 20 is more
than just a coincidence. It's almost a tradition.

"Beryl" was the name of Bankole's mother. Bankole and I had been
bickering over it for months, and I had known that it would show up
somewhere in our daughter's name. As long as it wasn't her first name,
it was endurable. It has a good denotative meaning. A beryl is a very
hard clear or cloudy mineral which, when properly shaped and polished,
has great potential for beauty. The emerald is a kind of beryl.

"Ife" is the Yoruba personal name we've chosen to go with our two Yoruba
surnames---since my grandfather and Bankole's father had chosen to take
Yoruba surnames back in the 1960s. "Ife" was Bankole's idea. I didn't
remember it. We had pooled our memories of Yoruba names, and as soon as
Bankole came up with "Ife," it seemed right to both of us. It means
"love," Bankole says.

And, of course, she was "Olamina" and "Bankole." So many names for one
little girl. When she's older, she'll no doubt choose a couple of them
and drop the others.

She's whole and beautiful and healthy, and I love her more than I would
have thought possible. I'm still sore and tired, but it doesn't matter.
She weighs three and a half kilos, has a big appetite, and a good loud
voice.

Bankole sits, now, holding her as she sleeps---holding her and looking
down at her, rocking her in the beautiful, ornate wooden rocking chair
that Gray Mora paid Allie Gilchrist to make for him. Gray likes to build
big things---cabins, storehouses, buildings of any kind. He designs
them, organizes the building, and works on them. As long as he's
building something, he's a happy man. The school is his doing, and if he
were any more proud of it, he'd be impossible. But he leaves the
designing and building of small things, furniture in particular, to
Allie Gilchrist. She taught herself her craft not only by reading
salvaged books, but by taking apart salvaged furniture to see how it was
made. Now, at street markets, she sells the chairs, tables, cabinets,
chests, toys, tools, and decorative items that she makes, and she gets
good prices for them. Her son Justin is only nine, but he's already
pleased her very much by picking the work up from her, learning it and
enjoying it. May and the Noyer girls are also beginning to learn the
craft, although May is more interested in weaving grasses, roots, bark,
and other fibers into mats, baskets, and bags.

Four years ago, after Bankole delivered Gray's first son, Gray paid
Allie to build a fine rocking chair for "the doctor." Gray and Bankole
hadn't gotten along very well at first---Gray's fault, and he knew it.
He pretended to be contemptuous of Bankole---"a pussy-whipped old
man!"---when, in fact, Bankole's age, education, and personal dignity
intimidated him. Until Gray's wife had become pregnant with their first
son, the two men barely spoke. Then Bankole took care of Emery during
her pregnancy and during Joseph's difficult birth---he was breech. After
that, the handsome, oaken chair, given in stolid silence, had served as
Gray's peace offering. Now Bankole sits in it rocking, looking into his
daughter's sleeping face, touching it as though he can't quite believe
it's real, and yet, as though it's more real, more important than
anything else in his world.

He seems to have taken his cue from Adela Ortiz. He says Larkin looks
just like his younger sister did when she was a baby. That's the sister
whose bones we found when we arrived here. Her bones, her husband's, her
children's. After their deaths, Bankole must have felt cut off from the
future, from any immortality of the flesh, the genes. He had no other
relatives. Now he has a daughter. I'm not sure he even realizes how much
of the time over the past couple of days that he's been smiling.

[SUNDAY, JULY]{.small} 24, 2033

Today we Welcomed Larkin into the community---into Acorn and into
Earthseed.

So far, I've been the one to Welcome each new child or adult adoptee. I
don't conduct every Sunday Gathering, but I have Welcomed every
newcomer. By now, it's expected---something I'm *supposed* to do. This
time, though, I asked Travis to perform the ceremony. And, of course, we
asked Harry and Zahra to stand with us. Bankole and I are already
Change-sister and -brother to them and Change-aunt and -uncle to their
children. Now it goes the other way as well. We each stand ready to
parent one another's children. The Balters are my oldest friends and I
trust them, but I hope the pledges we've given one another will never
have to be kept.

It makes us more truly a community, somehow, now that so many of us have
had children here...now that I've had a child here.

*Larkin Beryl Ife Olamina Bankole,*

*We, your people*

*Welcome you....*

[SATURDAY, JULY]{.small} 30, 2033

"I don't think you can truly understand how I feel," Bankole said to me
last night as he sat down to eat the dinner I had kept warm for him. He
had been on evening watch, sitting with binoculars at a mountain
overlook where he could see whether some new gang of thugs was
approaching to destroy his family. He's more serious than ever about
maintaining our 24-hour watch, but for each of us, standing watch is
still a tiresome duty. I didn't expect him to come home in a good mood,
but he was still on enough of a new-daddy high not to be too
bad-tempered.

"You just wait until Larkin starts waking him up more," Zahra has warned
me.

No doubt she's right.

Bankole sat down at the table and sighed. "Before I met you," he said,
"there were times when I felt as though I were already dead." He looked
at me, then at Larkin's crib where she slept, full of milk and, so far,
dry. "I think you've saved me," he said. "I wish you'd let me save you."

That again. The people of Halstead had found themselves another doctor,
but they didn't like him. There was some doubt as to whether he really
was a doctor. Bankole thought he might have some medical training, but
that he was something less than or other than an M.D. He was only about
35, and these days, almost all young physicians---those under 50---were
working in privatized or foreign-owned cities, towns, or huge farms.
There, they could earn enough to give their families good lives and the
company police would keep them safe from marauding thugs or desperate
poor people. There had to be something wrong with a 35-year-old doctor
who was still looking for a place to hang out his shingle.

Bankole said he thought a sick or injured person would be safer in the
hands of Natividad or Michael than with Halstead's new "Doctor" Babcock.
He had warned several of his Halstead friends, and they had let him know
that he was still welcome. They didn't doubt his medical knowledge, and
they preferred to have him. And he still wanted to save me by taking me
to live among them.

"Acorn is a community of people who have saved one another in all kinds
of ways," I told him. "Acorn is home."

He looked at me again, then set to work on his dinner. It was late, and
I had already eaten. I had taken the baby and gone to eat with Zahra and
Harry and their kids. But now, I sat with him, sipping hot mint tea with
honey and enjoying the peace. The fire in our antique, salvaged
woodstove had burned to almost nothing, but the stove's cast-iron body
was still warm and the July night wasn't cold. We were using only three
small oil lamps for light. No need to waste electricity. The lamplight
was soft and flickering.

I stared into the shadows, enjoying the quiet, family togetherness,
content and drowsy until Bankole spoke again.

"You know," he said, "it took me a long time to trust you. You seemed so
young---so vulnerable and idealistic, yet so dangerous and knowing."

"What?" I demanded.

"Truth. You were quite a contradiction. You still are. I thought you
would grow out of it. Instead, I've gotten used to it---almost."

We do know one another after six years. I can often hear not only what
he says but what he does not say. "I love you too," I said, not quite
smiling.

Nor did he allow himself to smile. He leaned forward, forearms on the
table, and spoke with quiet intensity. "Talk to me, girl. Tell me
exactly what you want to do in this place, with these people. Leave out
the theology this time, and give me some step-by-step plans, some
material results that you hope to achieve."

"But you know," I protested.

"I'm not sure that I do. I'm not sure that *you* do. Tell me."

I understood then that he was looking for reasons to reevaluate his
position. He still believed that we should leave Acorn, that we could be
safe only in a bigger, richer, longer-established town. "Convince me,"
he was saying.

I drew a long, ragged breath. "I want what's happening," I said. "I want
us to go on growing, becoming stronger, richer, educating ourselves and
our children, improving our community. Those are the things that we
should be doing for now and for the near future. As we grow, I want to
send our best, brightest kids to college and to professional schools so
that they can help us and in the long run, help the country, the world,
to prepare for the Destiny. At the same time, I want to send out
believers who have missionary inclinations---send them in family groups
to begin Earthseed Gathering Houses in non-Earthseed communities.

"They'll teach, they'll give medical attention, they'll shape new
Earthseed communities within existing cities and towns and they'll focus
the people around them on the Destiny. And I want to establish new
Earthseed communities like Acorn---made up of people collected from the
highways, from squatter settlements, from anywhere at all. Some people
will want to stay where they are and join Earthseed the way they might
join the Methodists or the Buddhists. Others will need to join a closer
community, a geographical, emotional, intellectual unit." I stopped and
drew a long breath. Somehow I had never dared to say this much about my
plans to any one person. I had been working them out in my own mind,
writing about them, talking about them in bits and pieces to the group
at Gathering, but never assembling it all for them. Maybe that was a
mistake. Problem was, we'd been focused for so long on immediate
survival, on solving obvious problems, on business, on preparing for the
near future. And I've worried about scaring people off with too many big
plans. Worst of all, I've worried about seeming ridiculous. It *is*
ridiculous for someone like me to aspire to do the things I aspire to
do. I know it. I've always known it. It's never stopped me. "We are a
beginning," I said, thinking as I spoke. "It's as though Earthseed is
only an infant like Larkin---'one small seed.' Right now we would be so
very easy to stamp out. That terrifies me. That's why we have to grow
and spread---to make ourselves less vulnerable."

"But if you went to Halstead," he began, "if you moved there---"

"If I went to Halstead, the seed here might die." I paused, frowned,
then said, "Babe, I'm no more likely to leave Acorn now than I am to
leave Larkin."

That seemed to rock him back a little. I don't know why, after all that
I've already said. He shook his head, sat staring at me for several
seconds. "What about President Jarret?"

"What about him?"

"He's dangerous. His being President is going to make a difference, even
to us. I'm sure of it."

"We're nothing to him, so small, so insignificant---"

"Remember Dovetree."

Dovetree was the last thing I wanted to remember. So was that state
senate candidate that Marc mentioned. Both were real, and perhaps both
meant danger to us, but what could I do about either of them? And how
could I let the fear of them stop me? "This country is over 250 years
old," I said. "It's had bad leaders before. It survived them. We'll have
to watch what Jarret does, change when necessary, adapt, maybe keep a
little quieter than we have for a while. But we've always had to adapt
to changes. We always will. God is Change. If we have to start saying
'Long live Jarret' and 'God bless Christian America,' then we'll say it.
He's temporary."

"So are we. And living with him won't be that easy."

I leaned toward him. "We'll do what we have to do, no matter who's
warming the chair in the Oval Office. What choice do we have? Even if we
run and hide in Halstead, we'll still be subject to Jarret. And we'll
have no good friends around us to help us, lie for us if necessary, take
risks for us. In Halstead, we'll be strangers. We'll be easy to pick out
and blame and hurt. If vigilante crazies or even cops of some kind come
asking questions about us or accusing us of witchcraft or something,
Halstead might decide we're more trouble than we're worth. If things get
bad, I want my friends around me. Here at Acorn, if we can't save
everything, we can at least work together to save one another. We've
done that before."

"This is like nothing we've faced before." Bankole's shoulders slumped,
and he sighed. "I don't know that this country has ever had a leader as
bad as Jarret or as bad as Jarret might turn out to be: Keep that in
mind. Now that you're a mother, you've got to let go of some of the
Earthseed thinking and think of your child. I want you to look at Larkin
and think of her every time you want to make some grand decision."

"I can't help doing that," I said. "This isn't about grand decisions.
It's about her and her future." I drank the last of my tea. "You know,"
I said, "for a long time, it terrified me---honestly terrified me---to
think that the Destiny itself was so big, so complex, so far from the
life I was living or anything that I could ever bring about alone, so
far from anything that even seemed possible. I remember my father saying
that he thought even the pitiful little space program that we've just
junked was stupid and wrong and a huge waste of money."

"He was right," Bankole said.

"He *was not right*!" I whispered, my feelings flaring. After a moment,
I said, "We need the stars, Bankole. *We need purpose!* We need the
image the Destiny gives us of ourselves as a growing, purposeful
species. We need to become the adult species that the Destiny can help
us become! If we're to be anything other than smooth dinosaurs who
evolve, specialize, and die, we need the stars. That's why the Destiny
of Earthseed is to take root among the stars. I know you don't want to
hear verses right now, but that one is...a major key to us, to human
beings, I mean. When we have no difficult, long-term purpose to strive
toward, we fight each other. We destroy ourselves. We have these
chaotic, apocalyptic periods of murderous craziness." I stopped for a
moment, then let myself say what I had never said to anyone. He had a
right to hear it. "Early on, when I told people about the Destiny, and
most of them laughed, I was afraid. I worried that I couldn't do this,
couldn't reach people and help them see truth. Later, when the people of
Acorn began to accept all the Earthseed teachings except the Destiny, I
worried more. People seem to be willing to believe all kinds of stupid
things---magic, the supernatural, witchcraft....But I couldn't get them
to believe in something real, something that they could make real with
their own hands. Now...now most of the people here accept the Destiny.
They believe me and follow me, and...damned if I don't worry even more."

"You never said so." Bankole reached out and took my hands between his.

"What could I say? That I believe in Earthseed, yet I doubt my own
abilities? That I'm afraid all the time?" I sighed. "That's where faith
comes in, I guess. It always comes sooner or later into every belief
system. In this case, it's have faith and work your ass off. Have faith
and work the asses off a hell of a lot of people. I realize all that,
but I'm still afraid."

"Do you think anyone expects you to know everything?"

I smiled. "Of course they do. They don't believe I know it all, and they
wouldn't like me much if I did, but somehow, they do expect it. Logic
isn't involved in feelings like that."

"No, it isn't. I suspect that logic isn't involved in trying to found a
new religion and then having doubts about it either."

"My doubts are personal," I said. "You know that. I doubt myself, not
Earthseed. I worry that I might not be able to make Earthseed anything
more than another little cult." I shook my head. "It could happen.
Earthseed is true---is a collection of truths, but there's no law that
says it has to succeed. We can always screw it up. I can always screw it
up. There's so much to be done."

Bankole went on holding my hands, and I let myself go on talking,
thinking aloud. "I wonder sometimes whether I'll make it. I might grow
old and die without seeing Earthseed grow the way that it should,
without leaving the Earth myself or seeing others leave, maybe without
even focusing serious attention on the Destiny. There are so many little
cults---like earthworms twisting and feeding, forming and splitting, and
going nowhere."

"I'll die without seeing the results of most of your efforts," Bankole
said.

I jumped, looked at him, then said, "What?"

"I think you heard me, girl."

I never know what to say when he starts talking that way. It scares me
because, of course, it's true.

"Listen," he said. "Do you really think you can spend your life---your
life, girl!---struggling and risking yourself, maybe risking our child
for a...a cause whose fulfillment you...probably won't live to see?
Should you do such a thing?" I could feel him holding himself back,
trying so hard to discourage me without offending me.

He let my hands go, then moved his chair around closer to me. He put his
arm around me. "It's a good dream, girl, but that's all it is. You know
that as well as I do. You're an intelligent person. You know the
difference between reality and fantasy."

I leaned against him. "It's more than a good dream, babe. It's right.
It's true! And it's so big and so difficult, so long-term, and as far as
money is concerned, it's potentially so profitless, that it'll take all
the strong religious faith we human beings can muster to make it happen.
It's not like anything humanity has ever done before. And if I can't
have it, if I can't help to make it happen..." To my amazement, I felt
myself on the verge of tears. "If I can't give it the push it needs, if
I can't live to see it succeed..." I paused, swallowed. "If I can't live
to see it succeed, then, maybe Larkin can!" I found the words all but
impossible to say. It was not a new idea to me that I might not live to
see the Destiny fulfilled. But it felt new. Now Larkin was part of it,
and it felt new and real. It felt true. It made me frantic inside, my
thoughts leaping around. I felt as though I didn't know what to do. All
of a sudden, I wanted to go stand beside Larkin's crib and look at her,
hold her. I didn't move. I leaned against Bankole, unsettled, trembling.

After a while, Bankole said, "Welcome to adulthood, girl."

I did cry then. I sat there with tears running down my face. I couldn't
stop. I made no noise, but of course, Bankole saw, and he held me. At
first I was horrified and disgusted with myself. I don't do that. I
don't cry on people. I've never been that kind of person. I tried to
pull away from Bankole, but he held me. He's a big man.

I'm tall and strong myself, but he just folded his arms around me so
that I couldn't get away from him without hurting him. After a moment, I
decided I was where I wanted to be. If I had to cry on someone's
shoulders, well, his were big and broad.

After a time, I stopped, all cried out, exhausted, ready to get up and
go to bed. I wiped my face on a napkin, and looked at him. "I wonder if
that was some kind of postpartum something-or-other?"

"It might have been," he said, smiling.

"It doesn't matter," I told him. "I meant everything I said."

He nodded. "I guess I know that."

"Then let's go to bed."

"Not yet. Listen to me, Olamina."

I sat still and listened.

"If we stay here, if I agree that you and Larkin and I are going to stay
here, this place is not going to be just one more squatter's shanty."

"It was never that!"

He held up his hand. "My daughter will not grow up grubbing for a living
through the ruins of other people's homes and trash heaps. This place
will be a town---a twenty-first-century town. It will be a decent place
to raise a child---a place with some hope of survival and success.
Whatever other grand things we do or fail to do, we will do that much!"

"It's an Acorn," I said, stroking his face, his beard. "It will grow."

He almost smiled. Then he was solemn again. "If I accept this, I'm in it
for good! If you change your mind after a few hard times..."

"Do I tend to do that, babe? Am I like that?"

He stared hard at me, silent, weighing.

"I helped you build this house," I said, referring to the literal
meaning of his name, *help me build a house.* "I helped you build this
house. Now there's so much more work to do."

[FROM]{.small} *The Journals of Lauren Oya Olamina*

[MONDAY, SEPTEMBER]{.small} 26, 2033

They didn't shoot their way in. It seems that they don't intend to kill
us. Yet. Since Dovetree, they have changed. Their leader has come to
power. They have acquired...if not legitimacy, at least a shadow of
sophistication. Roaring in, shooting everyone, and burning everything is
perhaps too crude for them now. Or maybe it's just not as much fun.

I write, not knowing how long I will be able to write. I write because
they have not yet robbed us of everything. Our freedom is gone, our two
trucks, our land, our business, our homes are gone, stolen from us. But
somehow, I still have paper, pens, and pencils. None of our captors
values these things, so no one has yet taken them from me. I must keep
them hidden or they will be taken. All possessions will be taken. They
will strip us. They've made that all too clear. They will break us down,
reshape us, teach us what it means to love their country and fear their
God.

Our several secret caches of food, weapons, money, clothing, and records
have not been found. At least, I don't believe they have been. No one
has heard that they have.

We're shut up in two of the rooms of the school. Our books are still
here on their shelves. The various projects of our students are still
here. Our several phones and our five new teaching computers are gone.
They have hard-currency value. Also, they were a means of communicating
with the outside. We are not permitted to do that. That would inhibit
our reeducation.

I must make a record of all this. I don't want to, but I must. And I
must hide that record so that, someday, Earthseed will know what
Earthseed has survived.

We will do that. We will survive. I don't yet know how. How is always a
problem. But, in fact, we will survive.

Here is what happened.

Late Tuesday afternoon last week, I was sketching two of the Faircloth
kids and talking with them about the project they wanted to work on for
school. They had, in their required study of history, just discovered
World War II, and they wanted to build models of the battleships,
submarines, and airplanes of the time. They wanted to report on the big
battles and find out more about the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki. They were fascinated by all of the loud, explosive events
of the War, but they had no idea what a huge subject they had chosen or,
beyond the barest outline, why the War had been fought. I had decided to
sketch them while the three of us talked about it and narrowed things
down.

The Faircloth family had always been poor, had lived in a squatter
settlement before they came to us. Alan Faircloth had small, badly
creased, paper photos of the boys as babies, but nothing recent. He had
pleased me more than I would have been willing to admit by asking me to
draw the two of them. I had become vain about my drawing. It was finally
somewhere near good. Even Harry, Zahra, and Allie had said so, and they
were the ones who had the most fun with my earlier efforts.

The boys and I were outside behind the school, enjoying a warm, easy
day. Larkin lay next to me, asleep in her crib in spite of the noise the
boys made. She was already used to noise. The boys were 11 and 12, small
for their age, always loud, and unlikely to be still for more than two
or three minutes at a time. First they peeked at Larkin, then they lost
interest and shouted first at each other, then at me about weapons and
battles, dive-bombers and aircraft carriers, Hitler, Churchill, Tojo,
London, Stalingrad, Tokyo, on and on. Interesting that a thing as
terrible and as massive as a worldwide war could seem so wonderful and
exciting to a pair of preadolescent boys whose grandparents weren't born
in time for it---although they did have paternal grandparents who were
born and raised in London.

I sketched the boys quickly while listening to their enthusiasm and
making suggestions. I was just finishing the sketches when the maggots
arrived.

A maggot, nicknamed in its ugly shape, is something less than a tank,
and something more than a truck. It's a big, armed and armored,
all-terrain, all-wheel-drive vehicle. Private cops and military people
use them, and people with plenty of money drive them as private cars.
Maggots can go almost anywhere, over, around, or through almost
anything. The people of Halstead have one. They've used it now and then
to collect Bankole. Several small local towns have one or two for their
cops or for search and rescue in the hills. But the things are serious
fuel eaters---expensive to run.

That Friday, seven maggots came crawling out of the hills and through
our thorn fence toward us. There had been no warning from the watchers.
Nothing at all. That was my first thought when I saw them coming: Where
were Lucio Figueroa and Noriko Kardos? Why hadn't they warned us? Were
they all right?

Seven maggots! That was three or four times as much firepower as we
could muster if we brought out every one of our guns. Only our truck
guns would have even a ghost of a chance of stopping a maggot, anyway.

Seven of the damned things!

"Go home!" I said to the two boys. "Tell your father and sisters to get
the hell out. No drill. The real thing! Get out, fast and quiet! Run!"

Both boys ran.

I took my phone from my pocket and tapped out the emergency bug-out
signal. We've had bug-out exercises. Bankole called them that, and the
name spread. I thought of them as "melt into the mountains" exercises.
Now we faced the real thing. It had to be real. No one came visiting in
seven armed and armored maggots.

I grabbed my Larkin as fast as I could and ran for the hills. I tried to
keep the school building between the two of us and the nearest maggots.
They were crawling toward us in what could have been a military
formation. They could run us down, shoot us, do whatever they chose to
do. The only thing we might be able to do that they couldn't do was
vanish into the mountains. But could we even do that? If we kept still,
the maggots' sensory equipment would spot us. And if we ran, the rocks
and trees and thorn bushes wouldn't give us much protection from the
maggots' guns. But what could we do but run? As long as no one came out
of the maggots, we had nothing to shoot at.

Where was Bankole? I didn't know. Well, we had rendezvous points. We
would find each other. The idea was *not* to waste time running around
looking for relatives. Except for babies and very young children,
everyone knew from the drills that a command to get out meant exactly,
that. "*Get out now!*"

And we were to go in all directions. We were not to follow one another
or group together and provide our enemies with big, easy targets. As
much as possible, we were to put trees and geographical features between
ourselves and the enemy.

But what were we to do when the enemy was everywhere?

Then, in the same instant, all seven of the maggots began firing. It
took me a moment to realize that they were not firing bullets, that,
perhaps, we were not about to be killed. They were firing gas canisters.
I kept running, hoping that others were doing the same. No matter what
the gas was, it was not intended to do us good.

I headed through the young oak grove that was our cemetery toward the
fold of a hill that I hoped would both shelter me and give me an easier
path up over the first hill.

Then just ahead of me, a canister landed. Before it hit the ground, it
began to spew out gas.

And my legs wouldn't hold me. I was running. Then I felt myself begin to
fall. It was all I could do to manage not to fall on my baby, instead to
have her fall on me. I heard her begin to cry---a thin, un-Larkinlike
whimpering. I don't believe I cried out. I know I never lost
consciousness. It was a terrible gas. I still don't know the name of it.
It took away most of my ability to move, but left me wide awake, able to
hear and see, able to know that my people were being collected like
driftwood, being carried or dragged away by uniformed men.

Someone came to me, bent, and took Larkin from me. I couldn't move my
head to see what he did with her. I couldn't struggle or protest or
plead. I couldn't even scream.

Someone came for me and took me by the feet and dragged me over the
ground, down the hill to the school. I was wearing denims and a light
cotton shirt, and I could feel my back scraping over rocks and weeds. I
could feel pressure---bumping and thudding. It didn't hurt as it was
happening, but I knew it would hurt. All the adults and older kids had
been carried or dragged to the school. I could see several of them
sprawled on the floor wherever their captors had dropped them. What I
could not see were the babies and young children.

I could not see my Larkin.

At one point, I heard shooting outside. It came from the south side of
the school, not far away. It sounded like the guns of our older truck.
Perhaps one of us had reached the truck and tried to use it as Bankole,
Harry, and I had back when Dan and Nina Noyer came home. That was
hopeless. Our old housetruck wouldn't have been a match for even one
maggot. Then I heard a huge explosion. After that there was silence.

What had happened? Were the children involved? Not knowing was an
agonizing torment. Utter helplessness was even worse. I could breathe. I
could twitch a hand or a foot. I could blink. Nothing more.

After a while, I could whimper a little.

Sometime later, a man wearing the uniform of the day---black pants and a
belted, black tunic with a white cross on its front, came to do
something to us, to each of us. I couldn't see what he was doing until
he got to me, unbuttoned three buttons of my shirt, raised my head, and
fastened the slave collar around my neck.

It was that simple. They took Acorn. Its name is Camp Christian now. We
captives were not able to do more than twitch, blink, or moan for over
an hour. That was plenty of time to collar almost all of us.

No one collared Gray Mora. He had been a slave earlier in his life. He
had never worn a collar, but he had spent his childhood and young
manhood as the property of people who treated him not quite as well as
they treated their cattle. They had taken his wife from him and sold her
to a wealthy man who had seen her and wanted her. She was, according to
Gray, a short, slight, very pretty woman, and she brought a good price.
Her new owner made casual sexual use of her and then somehow, by
accident or not, killed her. When Gray heard about that, he took his
daughter Doe and broke free. He never told us exactly how he got free.
I've always assumed he killed one or more of his masters, stole their
possessions, and took off. That's what I would have done.

But this time, there was no escape. And yet Gray would not be a slave
again.

I found out later that he managed to get to the housetruck, lock himself
in, and fire on some of the maggots. That scratched them more than a
little. Then, as the maggots began to fire on him and blow the
housetruck's armor to hell, he charged one of them. He rammed it. There
was an explosion. There shouldn't have been.

The housetruck was as safe as it could be. Making it explode had to take
a conscious effort---unless it was the maggot that exploded. I don't
know for sure. But knowing Gray, I suspect he did something to cause the
explosion. I believe he chose to die.

He is dead.

I can't believe that any of this is true. Į mean...there ought to be a
different way to write about these things---a way that at least begins
to express the insanity and the terrible, terrible pain of it all. Acorn
has always been full of ugly stories. There wasn't an adult among us who
didn't have one. But we'd come together, lived together, helped one
another, survived, thrived, we'd done that! *We'd done all that!* We'd
made a good home for ourselves, were making an honest living. Now people
with crosses have come and put slave collars on us.

And where is my baby? Where is Larkin?

They separated the women and older girls from the men and older boys
while we were paralyzed. They left the men in the larger room of the
school and dragged us women into one of the smaller ones. I didn't think
about it at the time, but that was an odd thing to do because there were
more women than men in the community. We were dumped onto the wooden
floor, half atop one another, and left there. The windows were open, and
I remember thinking it strange that no one bothered to board them up or
even close them.

The only good thing was that as I was half lifted and half dragged, I
saw Bankole. I don't believe he saw me. He was lying on his back,
staring straight up, one scraped, bloody hand on his chest. I saw him
blink. I did see that, so I knew he was alive. If only he had gotten
away. He would have been more likely than anyone else to find some way
to help the rest of us. Besides, what will our captors do to a man his
age? Would they care that he was old? No. From the way he looked, it was
clear that he had been dragged across the ground just as I was. They
didn't care.

Would they care that my Larkin was only a baby? And where was she?
*Where was she?*

I was terrified every time someone came near me. All our captors were
young men, and I'd seen two or three angry, bloody ones. I didn't know
at the time that this was Gray's work. I didn't know anything. All I
could think about was Larkin, Bankole, my people, and the damned slave
collar around my neck.

As the sun went down, my body began to hurt---my back and my hands and
arms burned where they had scraped along the ground as I was dragged. My
head felt lumpy and sore. It also ached in a hard, throbbing way that
might have had something to do with the gas.

It was dark when I began trying to move. For a long time, all I could do
was flop around a little. Someone in the room groaned. Someone else
began to cry. Someone gasped, choked, and began to cough. Someone said
over and over again, "Ah shit!" and I recognized Allie Gilchrist's
voice.

"Allie?" I said. I slurred the word, sounded drunk to my own ears, but
she heard me.

"Olamina?"

"Yeah."

"Look, did you see Justin before they dragged you in here?"

"No. Sorry. Did you see Larkin?"

"No. Sorry."

"They took my baby too," Adela Ortiz said in a hoarse whisper. "They
took him and I don't know where he is." She began to cry.

I wanted to cry myself. I wanted to just to lie there and cry because I
hurt so much in so many ways. I felt too weak and uncoordinated to do
anything but cry. Instead, I sat up, bumped someone, apologized, sat
stupidly for a while, then found the sense to say, "Who else is here?
One by one, say your names."

"Noriko," a voice said just to my left. "They took Deborah and Melissa,"
she continued. "I had Melissa and Michael had Deborah. We were running.
I thought we were going to make it. Then that damned gas. We fell down,
and someone came and pulled both girls away from us. I couldn't see
anything but hands and arms taking them."

"And my babies," Emery Mora said. "My babies...." She was crying, almost
incoherent, "My little boys. My sons. They took my sons again. *Again*!"
She had had two young sons when she was a slave years ago, and they had
been sold away from her. She had been a debt slave---a legally
indentured person bound for her family's unpaid debts. The debts were
accumulated because she worked for an agribusiness corporation that
underpaid its workers in company scrip instead of money, then
overcharged them for food and shelter so that they could stay in
ever-increasing debt. It was against the law for the company to break up
families by selling minor children away from their parents or husbands
from their wives. It was against both local and federal law, so it
shouldn't have happened. Just as what's happened to us now shouldn't
have happened.

I thought about Emery's older daughter and stepdaughter. "What about
Tori and Doe?" I said. "Are they here? Tori? Doe?"

At first, there was no answer, and I thought of Nina and Paula Noyer. I
didn't want to think of them, but Doe and Tori Mora were 14 and 15---far
from babyhood. If they weren't here, where were they?

Then a very small voice said, "I'm here. Get off me."

"I'm trying to get off you," a stronger voice said. "There's no room in
here. I can hardly move."

Tori and Doe, alive, and as well as the rest of us were. I shut my eyes
and took a long, deep, grateful breath. "Nina Noyer?" I asked.

She began to answer, then coughed several times. "I'm here," she said at
last, "but my little sisters...I don't know what happened to them."

"Mercy?" I called. "Kassi?"

No answer.

"May?"

No answer. She couldn't talk, but she would have made a noise to let us
know she was there.

"She had Kassia and Mercy with her," Allie said. "She's strong and fast.
Maybe she got them away. She loved them like she gave birth to them."

I sighed. "Aubrey Dovetree?" I asked.

"I'm here," she said. "But I can't find Zoë or the kids....Zoë had all
three of them with her."

And Zoë had a heart condition, I thought. She might be dead, even if no
one meant to kill her. Not knowing what else to do, I went on with my
role call. "Marta Figueroa?"

"Yes," she whispered. "Yes, I'm here, all alone. My brother....My
children....Gone."

"Diamond Scott? Cristina Cho?"

"I'm here," said two voices at once, one in English and the other in
Spanish. Cristina's English was good now, but under stress, she still
reverted to Spanish.

"Beatrice Scolari? Catherine Scolari?"

"We're here," Catherine Scolari's voice said. She sounded as though she
had been crying. "Vincent is dead." she said. "He fell against a rock,
hit his head. I heard them say he was dead." Vincent was her husband and
Beatrice's brother. He had only one arm because of an accident that
happened before he joined us. He was, perhaps, more likely than most of
us to be off balance when the gas collapsed him. But still...

"He might not be dead," I said.

"He is. We saw him...." There were more sounds of crying. I didn't know
what to say to them. All I could think was that maybe Larkin was dead
too. And what about Bankole? I didn't want to think about death. I
didn't really want to think at all.

"Channa Ryan?" I said.

"I'm here. Oh god, I wish I wasn't."

"Beth Faircloth? Jessica Faircloth?"

There was no sound at first, then in nearly inaudible whispers, "We're
here. Both of us are here."

"Natividad?" I said. "Zahra?"

"I'm here," Natividad said in Spanish. Then, "If they've hurt my babies,
I'll cut their throats. I'll kill all of them. I don't care what they do
to me." She began to cry. She's strong, but her kids mean more than life
to her. She had a husband and three kids. Now, they're all gone from
her.

"All of our babies are gone," I said. "We have to find out where they're
being kept and who's guarding them and...and what's going to happen to
them." I shifted, trying to get more comfortable, but that was
impossible. "My Larkin should be nursing now. Right now. We have to find
out what we can."

"They've put slave collars on us," Marta Figueroa said in almost a moan.
"They took our kids and our men, and they put slave collars on us! What
the hell more do we need to know than that?"

"We have to know as much as we can," I answered. "They're not killing
us. They could have wiped us out. They separated us from the men and
from the young kids, but we're alive. We have to find a way to get our
kids back. Whatever we can do to get our kids back, we have to do it!" I
felt myself falling toward hysteria, toward weeping and screaming. I
tensed my body. Milk was leaking from my breasts onto my shirt, soaking
the front of it, and I ached so.

For a long time no one said anything. Then Teresa Lin, who had not
spoken before, whispered, "That window is open. I can see the stars."

"Did they put a collar on you?" I heard myself ask. I sounded almost
normal to my own ears. My voice was soft and low.

"What, this wide flat thing? They put one on me. I don't care. That
window is open! I'm getting out of here!" And she began scrambling over
people toward the window. Someone cried out in pain. Several voices
cursed her.

"Everybody down," I said. "Down on your face!"

I could not see who obeyed me. I hoped all the sharers did. I wasn't
sure what the collar would do to Teresa when she tried to get out the
window. Maybe it was a fake. Maybe it wouldn't do anything. Maybe it
would cut off her breath. Maybe it would collapse her, and cause her
terrible pain.

She dived out of the window. She's a slim woman, quick and lithe like a
boy. I looked up in time to see her arc out the window as though she
expected to land on something soft or on water.

Then she began to scream and scream and scream. Allie Gilchrist got up,
stepped to the window, and looked out at her. Then Allie tried to climb
out to help her. The moment Allie touched the window, she screamed, then
fell back into our prison room. Allie curled on her side against me, and
grunted several times---hard, agonized grunts. I turned my face away,
her pain twisting in my own middle. It helped that I hadn't been able to
see Teresa once she fell below the level of the window, but I had
already gotten a taste of her pain too.

Outside, Teresa went on screaming and screaming.

"No one's around," Allie said, still gasping. "She's just lying there on
the ground, screaming and twisting. No one's even come out to see."

She lay there all night. We couldn't help her. Her voice deteriorated
from full-throated screaming, the way any of us might scream in fear and
pain, to hoarse terrible grunting. She didn't pass out---or rather, she
did, but she kept coming to again and making her terrible noises.

Going near the door meant pain. Going to the window meant pain. Even if
you didn't try to get out, just being there hurt, hurt bad. Diamond
Scott volunteered to crawl around the floor, letting her own collar tell
her what was forbidden. People complained when she crawled over them,
but I asked them to put up with it and Di apologized and the complaints
stopped. We were still human, still civilized. I wondered how long that
would last.

"Someone's here!" Di said. She almost screamed the words. "Someone's
dead here!"

Oh, no. Oh, no.

"Who is it?" I asked.

"I don't know. She's cool. Not cold yet, but...I'm sure she's dead!"

I followed Di's voice, and spotted her silhouette, a darker shape in the
darkness. She was moving more than the others, scrambling away from the
body that she was sure must be dead.

Who was it?

Then, as I crawled toward the body, trying to be careful, trying not to
hurt anyone, I had a feeling, a memory. I was afraid I knew who it was.

The body was sitting upright in a corner, against the wall. It was
small---child-sized. It was a black woman's body---a black woman's hair,
nose, mouth, but so small....

"Zahra?"

She had not answered when I called her before. She was a bold, outspoken
little woman, and she would not have kept quiet in all this. She might
have been the one to go out the window before poor Teresa...if she could
have.

She was dead. Her body wasn't yet stiff, but it would be soon. It was
cooling. It wasn't breathing. I took the small hands between mine and
felt the ring that Harry had worked so hard to buy for her. He's
old-fashioned, Harry is, even though he's my age. He wanted his wife to
wear his ring so that no one would make a mistake. Back when Zahra was
the most beautiful woman in our Robledo neighborhood, she was beyond his
reach, married to another man. But when that man was dead and Harry saw
his chance, he moved right in. They were so different---black and white,
tiny and tall, street-raised and middle class. She was three or four
years older than he was. None of it mattered. They had managed, somehow,
to have a good marriage.

And now she was dead.

And where were her children? I had another sudden, horrible thought. I
felt for wounds on her, found scratches and dried blood, but no
penetrating wound, no terrible soft place on her head. She had been
brought in with the rest of us. Chances were, she was alive when she was
brought in. Wouldn't our captors have noticed if she were dead? We were
all dumped into this room and locked in by way of our collars during the
same few minutes.

After that, no one had come in.

Perhaps, then, it was the gas that had been used on us. Could she have
died of that? She was the smallest adult in the community, smaller,
even, than Nina, Doe, and Tori. Was it possible that she got too much of
the gas for her small size, and that killed her?

And if so, what did that say about our children?

Somehow, time passed. I sat rigid beside the body of my friend, and
couldn't think or speak. I cried. I cried in grief and terror and rage.
People told me later that I made no sound at all, but within myself, I
cried. Within myself, I screamed with Teresa, and I cried and cried and
cried.

After a time, I lay down on the floor, still crying, yet still making no
noise. I could hear people around me moaning, crying, cursing, talking,
but their words made no sense to me. They might as well have been in a
foreign language. I couldn't think of anything except that I wanted to
die. Everything that I had worked to build was gone, stolen or dead, and
I wanted to be dead too. My baby was dead. She must be. If I could have
killed myself, just then I would have. I would have been glad to do it.
I awoke, and there was sunlight streaming through the window. I had
slept. How could I have slept?

I awoke with my head on someone's lap. Natividad's lap. She had come to
sit against the wall next to Zahra's body. She had lifted my head off
the floor and put it on her lap. I sat up, blinking and looking around.
Natividad herself was asleep, although my moving woke her. She looked at
me, then at Zahra's body, then back at me, as though the world were just
coming back into focus for her, and it distressed her more and more
every second. Her eyes filled with tears. I hugged her for a long time,
then kissed her on the cheek.

The room was filled with sleeping women and girls. I counted 19 of us
including myself and...not including Zahra and Teresa. Everyone looked
dirty and scratched and abraded, and they lay in every possible
position, some sprawled alone on the floor, some in pairs or larger
groups, heads pillowed on laps, shoulders, or legs.

My breasts ached and leaked and I felt sick. I needed to use the
bathroom. I wanted my child, my husband, my home. Near me, Zahra was
cold and stiff, her eyes closed, her face beautiful and peaceful, except
for its gray color.

I got up, stepped over people as they began to wake up. I went to an
empty corner that I knew needed repair. A small earthquake a few months
ago had caused a slight separation between the wall and floor in that
corner. It wasn't obvious, but ants came in there, and water spilled
near there ran out. Gray had promised to fix it, but hadn't gotten
around to it.

I moved people away from the area---told them what I was doing and why.
They nodded and gave no trouble. I wasn't the only one with a full
bladder. I squatted there and urinated. When I finished, others followed
my example.

"Is Teresa still there?" I asked Diamond Scott, who was nearest to the
window.

Di nodded. "She's unconscious---or maybe dead." Her own voice sounded
dead.

"I'm so hungry," Doe Mora said.

"Forget hungry," Tori said. "If I could just have some water."

"Hush," I said to them. "Don't talk about it. It just makes you feel
worse. Has anyone seen our captors this morning?"

"They're building a fence," Diamond Scott said. "You can stand back from
the window and see them. In spite of the collars they've put on us,
they're building a fence."

I looked and saw maggots being used to string wire behind several of our
homes, up the slope. As I watched, they smashed through our cemetery,
breaking down some of the young trees that we planted to honor our dead.
The maggots were well named. They were like huge insect larvae, weaving
some vast, suffocating cocoon.

Our captors were keeping our land, then. Until that moment, this had not
occurred to me. They were not just out to steal or burn, enslave or
kill. That was what thugs had always done before. That was what they did
in my old neighborhood in Robledo, in Bankole's San Diego neighborhood,
and elsewhere. A lot of elsewheres. But these were staying, building a
fence. Why?

"Listen," I said.

Most of the room paid no attention to me. People had focused on their
own misery or on the maggots.

"Listen!" I said, putting as much urgency as I could into my voice.
"There are things we need to talk about."

Most of them turned to look at me. Nina Noyer and Emery Mora still
stared out the window.

"Listen," I said once more, wanting to shout, but not daring to. "Sooner
or later, our captors will come in here. When they do, we need to be
ready for them---as ready as we can be." I stopped, drew a deep breath,
and saw that now they were all looking at me, all paying attention.

"We need to pretend to go along with them as much as we can," I
continued. "We need to obey them and watch them, learn what they are and
what they want, and where they're weak!"

People looked at me either as though they thought I'd lost my mind or as
though it was good and hopeful news that our captors might, perhaps,
have weaknesses.

"Anything they tell us may be lies," I said. "Probably will be. So any
of us who get the chance should spy and eavesdrop and share information
with the rest. We can escape from them or kill them if we can learn
about them and pool our knowledge. Learn about the collars, too. Any
little thing might help. And most important, most essential, learn about
the kids."

"They'll rape us," Adela said, all but whimpering. "You know they will."
*She* knew they would---she who had already suffered so much rape. She
and Nina and Allie and Emery. The rest of us had been lucky---so far.
Now our luck has run out. Somehow, we'll have to cope with that.

"I don't know," I said. "They could already have raped us, and they
haven't. But...I suspect you're right. When men have absolute power over
women who are strangers, the men rape. And we're collared." I glanced
toward the window that Teresa's panic had driven her through. "If
someone decides to rape one of us, we won't be able to stop him." I
paused again. "I think...if you can't talk a guy out of it or beg and
cry and get his pity or bluff him into believing you have a disease,
then you'll have to put up with it." I paused, feeling inadequate and
stupid. I shouldn't be giving these women this kind of advice. I, who
had never been raped, had no right to tell them anything. I told them
anyway. "*Do put up with it!*" I said. "Don't throw your lives away.
Don't end up like Teresa. Learn everything you can from these people,
and bring what you learn back to the rest of us. Even the stupid, ugly
things that they say and do might be important. Their lying promises
might hide a truth. If we collect what we see and hear, if we stay
united, work together, support one another, then the time will come when
we can win our freedom or kill them or both!"

There was a long silence. They just stared at me. Then someone---Nina
Noyer---began to cry. "I was supposed to be free," she said through her
tears. "All this was supposed to be over. My brother died to bring me
here."

And all of a sudden, I felt *such* shame. All I wanted to do was lie
down on the floor in a tight knot around my uselessness and my aching
breasts and scream and scream. And I couldn't. I couldn't let myself
fail my people in one more miserable way.

And these were my people---*my people.* They had trusted me, and now
they were captives. And I could do nothing---nothing but give them
galling advice and try to give them hope. "God is Change," I heard
myself saying. "Our captors are on top now, but if we do this right, we
will beat them. It's that or just...die."

"I haven't been able to take my medicine," Beatrice Scolari said into
the near silence. "Maybe I will die." She had, in the past year,
developed high blood pressure, and Bankole had put her on medication.
Nina was still crying, now gathered against Allie, who rocked her a
little as though she were much younger. Allie herself was crying, but in
complete silence. Beatrice Scolari stared at me as though I could
produce her medicine.

"Your medicine is one of the first things we've got to ask for when they
start talking to us," I told Beatrice. "The very first thing we need is
help for Teresa---if it isn't too late." But they must have seen Teresa.
They must have heard her screaming earlier. Maybe they just didn't care.
They knew she couldn't get away. Maybe they wanted to use her to make
sure we understood our position. "We ask about our kids and about your
medicine, Beatrice." I continued. "Then....Then maybe they'll let
us...take care of Zahra."

We waited until afternoon, hungry, thirsty, scared, miserable, worried
about our children, and wondering about our men. No one paid any
attention to us. We saw the invaders going in and out of our homes,
finishing their fence, eating our food, but we saw them only from a
distance. Even Teresa, lying on the ground outside our window, was
ignored.

The younger girls cried and quarreled and complained. The rest of us sat
silent most of the time. We had all been through one kind of hell or
another. We had all survived enough to know that crying, complaining,
and quarreling did no good. We might forget that in time, but not yet.

Sometime around two or three o'clock, the door of our prison opened. A
huge, bearded man filled the doorway, and we stared up at him. He wore
the usual uniform---black tunic with white cross and black pants, and he
was at least two meters tall. He stared down at us as though we
smelled---which we did---and as though that were our fault.

"You and you," he said, pointing to me and to Allie. "Get out here and
pick up this corpse."

By reflex, Allie got a stubborn look on her face, but we both stood up.
"She's dead, too," I said, pointing to Zahra.

I never saw his hand move, but he must have done something. I screamed,
convulsed, dropped to the floor from a jolt of agony that seemed to come
from nowhere and everywhere. I was on fire. Then I wasn't. Searing
agony. Then nothing.

The man waited until I was able to look up at him, until I did look up.

"You don't speak unless you're spoken to," he said. "You do what you're
told when you're told to do it, and you keep your mouths shut!"

I didn't say anything. Somehow, I managed to nod. It occurred to me that
I should do that.

Allie stepped toward me to help me up, her hands already out to help me.
Then she doubled up in agony of her own. Echoes of her pain burned
through me, and I froze, teeth clenched. I was desperate not to announce
my extra vulnerability, my sharing. If I was held captive long enough,
they would find out. I knew that. But not now. Not yet.

The man didn't seem to take any special notice of me. He watched us both
and waited in seeming patience until Allie looked up, bewildered and
angry.

"You do what you're told and only what you're told," he said. "You don't
touch one another. Whatever filth you're used to, it's over. It's time
for you to learn to behave like decent Christian women---if you've got
the brains to learn."

So that was it, then. We were a dirty cult of free lovers, and they had
come to straighten us out. Educate us.

I believe Allie and I were chosen because we were the biggest of the
women. We were ordered to carry first Zahra, then Teresa, out to a patch
of ground where we grew jojoba plants for their oil. There, we were
given picks and shovels and ordered to dig graves---long, deep
holes---among the jojobas. We had had no food and no water. All we got
was a jolt of agony now and then when we slowed down more than our
overseer was willing to permit. The ground was bad---rocky and hard.
That was why we used it for jojoba plants. The plants are tough. They
don't need much. Now, it seemed that we were the ones who didn't need
much. I didn't think I could do it---dig the damned hole. It's been a
long time since I've felt so bad in every possible way, so horrible, so
scared. After a while, all I could think of was water, pain, and where
was my baby? I lost track of everything else.

I was digging Zahra's grave, and I couldn't even think of that. I just
wanted the digging to be over. She was my best friend, my Change-sister,
and she lay uncovered, waiting beside the hole as I dug, and it didn't
matter. I couldn't focus on it.

The other women were brought out of the school and made to watch us dig.
I knew that because my attention was caught by the sudden movement of
silent, approaching people. I looked up, saw the women shepherded toward
us by three black-tunic-and-cross-wearing men. Sometime later, I
realized that the men had also been marched out. They were kept
separate, and it seemed that some of them were digging too.

I froze, staring at them, looking for Bankole...and for Harry.

The sudden pain tore a grunt from me. I fell to my knees in the hole I
was digging.

"Work!" my slave driver said. "It's time you heathens learned to do a
little work."

I had not seen whom the men were burying. I saw Travis, shirt off,
swinging a pick into the hard ground. I saw Lucio Figueroa digging
another hole and Ted Faircloth digging a third. So they had three dead
to our two. Who were their dead? Which of our men had these bastards
killed?

Where was Bankole?

I hadn't spotted him. I had had such a quick look. I managed to look
again and again as I shoveled dirt out of the hole. In the cluster of
men, I spotted Michael, then Jorge, then Jeff King. Then the pain hit
again. I didn't fall this time. I held on to the shovel and leaned back
against the side of the hole I was digging.

"Dig!" the son of a bitch above me said. "Just dig!"

What would he do if I passed out? Would he go on triggering the collar
until I died like Teresa? Was he enjoying himself? He didn't smile as he
hurt me. But he did keep hurting me, even though I had shown no signs of
rebellion.

Submission was no protection. If any of us were to survive, we must
escape these people as quickly as possible.

The big, bearded slaver and perhaps three dozen of his kind stood around
us as we stood around the graves. We were made to parade past each grave
and look down at the dead. That was how Harry learned that Zahra was
dead and how Lucio Figueroa, who had only this year begun to take an
interest in Teresa Lin, came to know of her death. That was how I
learned that Vincent Scolari was dead, as his wife and sister believed.
And Gray Mora was dead---bloody and broken and dead. And that was how I
learned that my Bankole was dead.

There was chaos. Emery Mora and both her daughters began to scream when
they saw Gray's mangled body. Natividad and Travis ran into each other's
arms. Lucio Figueroa dropped to his knees beside Teresa's grave, and his
sister Marta tried to comfort him. Both Scolari women tried to go down
into the grave to touch Vincent, to kiss him, to say good-bye. We were
all lashed electronically for talking, screaming, crying, cursing, and
demanding answers.

And I was lashed into unconsciousness for trying to kill my bearded
keeper with a pickax. It would have been worth any amount of pain if
only I could have succeeded.

my mother had insisted on staying. And even if, in spite of my father's

**My mother was right about the gas. It was intended to be used to stop
riots, to subdue masses of violent people. Unlike poison gases that kill
or maim or gases that caused tears and choking, or nausea, this gas was
supposed to be merciful. It was called merciful. It was a paralysis gas.
Most of the time, it worked fast and caused no pain and had no nasty
aftereffects. But occasionally, children and small adults died of it.
For that reason, an antidote was developed to be administered to small
people who were overcome: It was given to me, to the rest of the little
children of Acorn. For some reason it wasn't given to Zahra Balter. She
was obviously an adult, in spite of her small size. Maybe the Crusaders
thought age was more important than size. There were no physicians among
them. There were no health workers of any kind. These were God's people
come to bring the true faith to the cultist heathens. I suppose if some
of the heathens died of it, that wasn't really very important.**

[THURSDAY, NOVEMBER]{.small} 24, 2033

Thanksgiving Day.

Should I be thankful still to be alive? I'm not sure.

Today is like Sunday---better than Sunday. We have been given extra food
and extra rest, and once services were over this morning, we were let
alone. I am thankful for that. For once, they aren't watching us. They
don't want to spend their holiday guarding us or "teaching" us, as they
put it. This means that today I can write. On most days, by the time
they let us alone, it's too dark to write and we're exhausted. After our
work outside, we're watched and made to memorize and recite sections of
the Bible until we can't think or keep our eyes open. I'm thankful to be
writing and I'm thankful not to hear my own voice chanting something
like, "Unto woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."

We're not permitted to speak to one another in our "teachers' "
presence, and yet not allowed to be quiet and rest.

Now I must find a way to write about the past few weeks, to tell what
has happened to us---just to tell it as though it were sane and
rational. I'll do that, if for no other reason than to give some order
to my scattered thoughts. I do need to write about...about Bankole.

All of our young children are gone. All of them. From Larkin, the
youngest, to the Faircloth boys, the oldest, they've vanished.

Now we are told that our children have been saved from our wickedness.
They've been given "good Christian homes." We won't see them again
unless we leave our "heathenism" behind and prove that we've become
people who can be trusted near Christian children. Out of kindness and
love, our captors---we are required to address them each as
"Teacher"---have provided for our children. They have put our children's
feet on the pathway to good, useful American citizenship here on Earth,
and to a place in heaven when they die. Now we, the adults and older
kids, must be taught to walk that same path. We must be reeducated. We
must accept Jesus Christ as our Savior, Jarret's Crusaders as our
teachers, Jarret as God's chosen restorer of America's greatness, and
the Church of Christian America as our church. Only then will we be
Christian patriots worthy to raise children.

We do not struggle against this. Our captors order us to kneel, to pray,
to sing, to testify, and we do. I've made it clear to the others through
my own behavior that we should obey. Why should anyone resist and risk
torture or death? What would be the good of that? We'll lie to these
murderers, these kidnappers, these thieves, these slavers. We'll tell
them anything they want to hear, do all that they require us to do.
Someday they'll get careless or their equipment will malfunction or
we'll find or create some weakness, some blind spot. Then we'll kill
them.

But even though we obey, the Crusaders must have their amusements. In
their loving kindness, they use the collars to torment us. "This is
nothing compared to the fires of hell," they tell us. "Learn your
lessons or you'll suffer like this for all eternity!" How can they do
what they do if they believe what they say?

They eat our food and feed us their leavings, either as bowls of obvious
table scraps or boiled up in a watery soup with turnips or potatoes from
our gardens. They live in our houses and sleep in our beds while we
sleep on the floor of the school, men in one room, women in another, no
communication between the two permitted.

None of us is decently married, it seems. We were not married by a
minister of the Church of Christian America. Therefore, we have been
living in sin---"fornicating like dogs!" I heard one Crusader say. That
same Crusader dragged Diamond Scott off to his cabin last week and raped
her. She says he told her it was all right. He was a man of God, and she
should be honored. Afterward, she kept crying and throwing up. She says
she'll kill herself if she's pregnant.

Only one of us has done that so far---committed suicide. Only one: Emery
Mora. She took revenge for what happened to her husband and for the
abduction of her two little boys. She seduced one of the Crusaders---one
of those who had moved into her own cabin. She convinced him that she
was willing and eager to sleep with him. Then sometime during the night,
she cut his throat with a knife she had always kept under her mattress.
Then she went to the Crusader sleeping in her daughters' room and cut
his throat. After that, she lay down in her bed beside her first victim
and cut her own wrists. The three of them were found dead the next
morning. Like Gray, Emery had taken substantial revenge.

For her own sake and the sake of her daughters, I wish she had chosen to
live. I knew she was depressed, and I tried to encourage her to endure.
At night when we were locked up together, we all talked, exchanged news,
and tried to encourage one another. But the truth is, if Emery had to
die, she chose the best possible way to do it. She's let us know that we
can kill our captors. Our collars would not stop us. If Emery had not
been confined by her collar to that one cabin, she might have killed
even more of them.

But *why* had her collar not stopped her from killing? According to what
Marc told me about his captivity, collars protected holders of control
units. Was this a matter of a different kind of collar? Perhaps. We
couldn't know that. None of the information we had collected and shared
in the night had to do with different kinds of collars. What we had
learned was that all our collars were linked together somehow in a kind
of collar network. All could be controlled by the units that our captors
wore as belts, but the belts themselves were powered or coordinated or
somehow controlled from a larger master unit that Diamond Scott believed
was kept in one of the two maggots that are always here. Things Di's
rapist had said while she was with him waiting to be raped again made
her certain that this was true.

A master control unit protected by the guns, locks, and armor of a
maggot was beyond our reach, for now. We had to learn more about it. It
occurred to me, though, that the reason the belt unit of Emery's rapist
had not saved its owner's life was simple: he had taken it off. What man
wore his belt to bed? Both of the men Emery had killed had taken their
belts off. Why not? Emery was a slender little woman. A man of ordinary
size wouldn't doubt his ability to control her with or without the
collar.

Once she had killed, Emery would have tried to use the belt units to
free herself, either to escape, to try to free us, or to take further
revenge. She would have tried. I'm sure of that. And she would have
failed either because she had the wrong fingerprints or because she
lacked some other necessary key. It was important to know that, but
there was more: she had tried the units, no doubt caused herself pain,
but she had failed to set off any alarms. Perhaps there were no alarms.
That could be very important someday.

We were all lashed for what Emery did. The men were made to watch.

We were marched out of the school and lashed as we were made to kneel
and pray, to scream out our sins, to beg for forgiveness, and quote
Bible verses on command. I kept thinking they would make a mistake and
kill some of us. This was an orgy of abuse and humiliation. It went on
and on for hours with our "teachers" taking turns, trading off,
screaming their hate at us, and calling it love. I had no voice at all
left by the time it was over. I was sore all over. An actual beating
couldn't have left me feeling any worse. And if anyone had been paying
attention to me in particular, they would have seen that I was a sharer.
I lost control. I couldn't have concealed anything.

I remember wishing I could die. I remember wondering if in the end they
would force us all to go the way Emery did, each of us taking a few of
them with us.

New people have been brought to live among us---men and women from
squatter camps and from nearby towns. Most of them seem to be just plain
poor people. Some were like the Dovetrees. They produced and sold drugs
or homemade beer, wine, or whiskey. And our neighbors the Sullivan and
the Gama families have been rounded up and brought here. Some of their
children used to attend our school, but none were captured with us. I
haven't seen any of them since our capture. Why have they been taken
captive and brought here now? No one seems to know.

The new women were stuffed in with us or put into the empty third room
of the school---the room that was once our clinic. The men were housed
in the big room with our men.

I need to write about Bankole.

I meant to do that when I began. I need to but I don't want to. It just
plain hurts too much.

The Crusaders are making us enlarge our prison and enlarge our cabins,
which are now their homes. And we work in the fields as before. We're
feeding livestock and cleaning their pens. We're turning compost, we're
planting herbs, we're harvesting winter fruits, vegetables and herbs,
clearing brush from the hills. We're expected to feed ourselves and our
captors. They eat better than we do, of course. After all, we owe them
more than we can ever pay, you see, because they're teaching us to
forsake our sinful ways. They keep talking about teaching us the meaning
of hard work. They tell us that we're no longer squatters, parasites,
and thieves. I've earned myself more than one lashing by saying that my
husband and I own this land, that we've always paid our taxes on it, and
that we've never stolen from anyone.

They've burned our books and our papers.

They've burned all that they could find of our past. It's all ungodly
trash, they say. They made us do most of the fetching and carrying, the
stacking and piling of so much that we loved. They watched us, their
hands on their belts. All the books on paper and on disk. All the
collections that our younger kids had assembled of minerals, seeds,
leaves, pictures...All the reports, models, sculptures and paintings
that our older kids have done. All the music that Travis and Gray wrote.
All the plays that Emery wrote. All the bits of my journal that they
could find. All the legal papers, including marriage licenses, tax
receipts, and Bankole's deed to the land. All these things, our teachers
threw lamp oil on and burned, then raked and stirred and burned again.

In fact, they've only burned copies of the legal papers. I'm not sure
that matters, but it's true. Since we got our first truck, we've kept
the originals in a safe-deposit box in Eureka---Bankole's idea. And we
keep other copies in our various caches, along with a few books, other
records, and the usual weapons, food, money, and clothing. I had been
scanning Bankole's writing and my journal notebooks and hiding disk
copies of them in the caches too. I don't know why I did this. In the
case of my journals, it's an indulgence that I've always been a little
ashamed of---wasting money copying my own stuff. But I remember I felt
much better when I began to do it. Now I only wish I had scanned Emery's
plays and Travis's and Gray's music. At least, as far as I know, the
caches are still safe.

I've hidden my writing paper, pens, and pencils away in our prison room.
Allie and Natividad have helped me loosen a couple of floorboards near
the window. With only sharp stones and a couple of old nails as tools,
we made a small compartment by scraping a hollow in one of the big
lumber girders that supports the floor joists. The joists themselves
were too slender and too obvious if anyone noticed a loose board. We
hoped no "teacher" would peer down into the darkness to see whether
anything might be in the girder. Natividad put her wedding ring there
too, and Allie put in some drawings that Justin had done. Noriko put in
a smooth, oval green stone. She and Michael had found it back when they
had gone out salvaging together---back when they could be together.

Interesting that we could scrape into the girder without pain from our
collars. Allie thought it meant we might be able to escape by loosening
more floorboards and crawling out under the school. But when we got Tori
Mora, the slenderest of us, to try to go down, she began to writhe in
pain the moment her feet reached the ground. She convulsed and we had to
pull her out.

So we know one more thing. It's a negative thing, but we needed to know
it.

So much is gone. So much has been taken from us and destroyed. If we
haven't found a way out, at least we've found a way to keep a few small
things. I find myself thinking sometimes that I could bear all this
better if I still had Larkin and Bankole, or if I could see Larkin and
know that she was alive and all right. If I could only just see her....

I don't know whether the actions of these so-called Crusaders have any
semblance of legality. It's hard to believe they might---stealing the
land and freedom of people who've followed the law, earned their own
livings, and given no trouble. I can't believe that even Jarret has so
mangled the constitution as to make such things legal. At least, not
yet. So how could a vigilante group have the nerve to set up a
"reeducation" camp and run it with illegally collared people? We've been
here for over a month and no one has noticed. Even our friends and
customers don't seem to have noticed. The Gamas and the Sullivans aren't
rich or powerful, but they've been in these hills for a couple of
generations. Hasn't anyone come asking questions about them?

Maybe they have. And who has answered the questions? Crusaders in their
other identities as ordinary, law-abiding patriots? I don't think it's
too much to assume they have such identities. What lies have they told?
Any group wealthy enough to have seven maggots, to support at least
several dozen men, and to have what seems to be an endless number of
expensive collars must be able to spread any lies it chooses to spread.
Perhaps our friends outside have been told believable lies. Or perhaps
they've just been frightened into silence, given to know that they
shouldn't ask too many questions lest they get into trouble themselves.
Or maybe it's just that none of us has powerful enough friends. We were
nobodies, and our anonymity, far from protecting us, had made us
vulnerable.

We at Acorn were told that we were attacked and enslaved because we were
a heathen cult. But the Gamas and the Sullivans aren't cultists. I've
asked women from both families why they were attacked, but they don't
know either.

The Gamas and the Sullivans owned their land just as we did, and unlike
the Dovetrees, the Gamas and the Sullivans had never raised marijuana or
sold alcoholic beverages. They worked their land and they took jobs in
the towns whenever they could find them. They worked hard and behaved
themselves. And in the end, what did it matter? All their hard work and
ours, all Bankole's attention to dead-and-gone laws, and all my hopes
for my Larkin and for Earthseed....I don't know what's going to happen.
We will get out of this! We'll do that somehow! But what then? From what
I've been able to hear, some of our "teachers" come from important
families in the Churches of Christian America in Eureka, Arcata, and the
surrounding smaller towns. This land is mine now. Bankole, with his
trust in law and order, made a will, I've read it. The copy we kept here
has been destroyed, of course, but the original and other copies still
exist. The land is mine, but how can I take it back? How can we ever
rebuild what we had?

When we break free of our "teachers," we will kill at least some of
them. I see no way to avoid this. If they have to, and if they can,
they'll kill us to stop our escape. The way they rape us, the way they
lash us, the way they let some of us die---all that tells me they don't
value our lives. Do their families know what they're doing? Do the
police know? Are some of these "teachers" cops themselves or relatives
of cops?

A great many people must know that *something* is going on. Each shift
of our "teachers" stays with us for at least a week, then goes away for
a week. Where do they tell people they've been? The area must be full of
people who know, at least, that something unusual is happening. That's
why once we've freed ourselves, I don't see how we can stay here. Too
many people here will hate us either because we've killed their men in
our escape or because they won't be able to forgive us for the wrongs
that they, their families, or their friends have done us.

Earthseed lives. Enough of us know it and believe it for it to live on
in us. Earthseed lives and will live. But Jarret's Crusaders have
strangled Acorn. Acorn is dead.

I keep saying that I need to write about Bankole, and I keep not doing
it. I was a zombie for days after I saw his body thrown into the bare
hole they made Lucio Figueroa dig. They said none of their prayers over
him, and, of course they refused to allow us to have services for him.

I saw him alive on the day the Crusaders invaded. I know I did. What
happened? He was a healthy man, and no fool. He would not have provoked
armed men to kill him. We're not allowed to talk to our men, but I had
to find out what happened. I kept trying until I found a moment to talk
to Harry Balter. I wanted it to be Harry so I could tell him about
Zahra.

We managed to meet in the field as we worked with only our own community
members nearby. We were harvesting---often in the rain---salad greens,
onions, potatoes, carrots, and squashes, all planted and tended by
Acorn, of course. We should also have been harvesting acorns---should
already have harvested them---but we weren't permitted to do that. Some
of us were being made to cut down both the mature live oak and pine
trees and the saplings that we had planted. These trees not only
commemorated our dead and provided us with much protein, but also they
helped hold the hillside near our cabins in place. Somehow, our
"teachers" have gotten the idea that we worshipped trees, thus we must
have no trees nearby except those that produce the fruit and nuts that
our "teachers" like to eat. Funny how that worked out. The orange,
lemon, grapefruit, persimmon, pear, walnut, and avocado trees were good.
All others were wicked temptations.

This is what Harry told me, bit by bit, during the times we managed to
be near one another in our work.

"They used the collars, you know?" he said. "On that first day, they
waited until we were all conscious. Then they came in and one of them
said, 'We don't want you to make any mistakes. We want you to understand
how this is going to work.' Then they started with Jorge Cho, and he
screamed and writhed like a worm on a hook. Then they got Alan
Faircloth, then Michael, then Bankole.

"Bankole was awake, but not really alert. He was just sitting on the
floor, holding his head between his hands, staring down. They had taken
all the furniture out by then, and piled it in a heap out where the
trucks were. So none of us fell on anything but the floor. When they
used the collar on him, he didn't make a sound. He just toppled over
onto his side and twitched, sort of convulsed. He never screamed, never
said a word. But he went into worse convulsions than any of the others
had. Then he was dead. That was all. Michael said the collar had
triggered a massive heart attack."

Harry didn't say more for a long time---or maybe he did, and I just
didn't hear it. I was crying in spite of myself. I could be quiet, but I
couldn't stop the tears. Then I heard him whisper, as we passed one
another again, "I'm sorry, Lauren. God, I'm sorry. He was a good guy."

Bankole had delivered both of Harry's children. Bankole had delivered
everyone's children, including his own daughter. Without believing in
Earthseed, or even in Acorn, he had stayed and worked hard to make it
all work. He had done more than anyone to make it work. How stupid and
pointless that he should die at the hands of men who didn't know him or
care about him or even intend to kill him. They just didn't know how to
use the powerful weapons they possessed. They gassed Zahra to death by
mistake because they didn't take her size into consideration. They
shocked Bankole into a heart attack by mistake because they didn't take
his age into consideration. It must have been his age. He'd had no heart
trouble before. He was a strong, healthy man who should have lived to
see his daughter grow up and maybe later father a son or another
daughter.

It was all I could do not to fold up among the rows of plants and just
lie there and moan and cry. But I stayed upright, somehow managed not to
attract our "teachers' " attentions.

After a time, I told him about Zahra. "I really believe it was her
size," I finished. "Maybe these people don't know much about their
weapons. Or maybe they just don't care. Maybe both. None of them lifted
a finger to help Teresa."

There was another long, long silence. We worked and Harry got himself
under control. When he spoke again, his voice was steady.

"Olamina, we've got to kill these bastards!"

He almost never called me Olamina. We'd known each other since we were
both in diapers. He called me Lauren except during the more important
Gathering Day ceremonies. He had called me Olamina for the first time
when I Welcomed his first child into the Acorn community, and into
Earthseed. It was as though for him the name were a title.

"First we've got to get rid of these collars," I said. "Then we have to
find out what happened to the kids. If...if they're alive, we have to
find out where they are."

"Do you think they are alive?"

"I don't know." I drew a deep breath. "I'd give almost anything to know
where my Larkin is and whether she's all right." Another pause. "These
people lie about almost everything. But there must be records somewhere.
There must be *something.* We've got to try to find out. Gather
information. Seek weakness. Watch, wait, and do what you have to to stay
alive!"

A "teacher" was coming toward us. Either he had spotted us whispering as
we worked or he was just checking. I let Harry move past me. Our few
moments of talk were over.

**F[ROM ACORN, I WAS]{.small} taken to a reeducation camp that was
housed in an old maximum-security prison in Del Norte County, just north
of Humboldt County. Pelican Bay State Prison, the thing had been called.
It became Pelican Bay Christian Reeducation Camp. I have no memory of
it, I'm glad to say, but people who spent time there as adults and older
kids have told me that even though it was no longer called a prison, it
reeked of suffering. Because of its prison structure, it lent itself
more easily than did Acorn to isolating people, not only from society
but from one another. It also provided enough room for a nursery that
was completely separate from the heathen inmates who might contaminate
the children. I was cared for at the Pelican Bay nursery for several
months. I know this because I was fingerprinted, footprinted, and
geneprinted there, and my records were stored at the Christian American
Church of Crescent City. They were supposed to be accessible only to
camp authorities, who were to prevent me from being adopted by my
heathen biological parents, and to whoever did adopt me. Also, there I
was given my name: Asha Vere. Asha Vere was the name of a character in a
popular Dreamask program.**

**Dreamasks---also known as head cages, dream books, or simply,
Masks---were new then, and were beginning to edge out some of the
virtual-reality stuff. Even the early ones were cheap---big
ski-mask-like devices with goggles over the eyes. Wearing them made
people look not-quite-human. But the masks made computer-stimulated and
guided dreams available to the public, and people loved them. Dreamasks
were related to old-fashioned lie detectors, to slave collars, and to a
frighteningly efficient form of audiovisual subliminal suggestion. In
spite of the way they looked, Dreamasks were lightweight, clothlike, and
comfortable. Each one offered wearers a whole series of adventures in
which they could identify with any of several characters. They could
live their character's fictional life complete with realistic sensation.
They could submerge themselves in other, simpler, happier lives. The
poor could enjoy the illusion of wealth, the ugly could be beautiful,
the sick could be healthy, the timid could be bold....**

**Jarret's people worried that this new entertainment would be like a
drug to the "morally weak." To avoid their censure, Dreamasks
International made a number of religious programs---programs that
particularly featured Christian American characters. Asha Vere was one
of those characters.**

**Asha Vere was a tall, beautiful, Amazon-like Black Christian American
woman who ran around rescuing people from heathen cults, anti-Christian
plots, and squatter-camp pimps. I suppose someone thought that naming me
after such an upright character might stifle any hereditary inclination
in me toward heathenism. So I was stuck with the name. And so, by the
way, were a lot of other women. Strong female characters were out of
fashion in the fiction of the time. President Jarret and his followers
in Christian America believed that one of the things that had gone wrong
with the country was the intrusion of women into "men's business." I've
seen recordings of him saying this and large audiences of both men and
women cheering and applauding wildly. In fact, I've discovered that Asha
Vere was originally intended to be a man, Aaron Vere, but a Dreamask
executive convinced his colleagues that it was time for a hit series
starring a tough-tender, Christian American female. He was right. There
was such a hunger for interesting female characters that, as silly as
the Asha Vere stories were, people liked them. And surprising numbers of
people named their girl children "Asha" or "Vere" or "Asha Vere."**

**My name, eventually, was Asha Vere Alexander, daughter of Madison
Alexander and Kayce Guest Alexander. These were middle-class Black
members of the Church of Christian America in Seattle. They adopted me
during the Al-Can war when they moved from Seattle---which had been hit
by several missiles---down to Crescent City, where Kayce's mother Layla
Guest lived. Ironically, Layla Guest was a refugee from Los Angeles. But
she was a much richer refugee than my mother had been. Crescent City, a
big, booming town among the redwoods, was so near Pelican Bay that Layla
volunteered at the Pelican Bay nursery. It was Layla who brought Kayce
and me together. Kayce didn't really want me. I was a big, dark-skinned,
solemn baby, and she didn't like my looks. "She was a grim, stone-faced
little thing," I heard her say later to her friends. "And she was as
plain as a stone. I was afraid for her---afraid that if I didn't take
her, no one would."**

**Both Kayce and Layla believed it was the duty of good Christian
Americans to give homes to the many orphaned children from squatter
settlements and heathen cults. If one couldn't be an Asha Vere, rescuing
all sorts of people, one could at least rescue one or two unfortunate
children and raise them properly.**

**Five months after Layla introduced her daughter to me, the Alexanders
adopted me. I didn't exactly become their daughter, but they meant to do
their duty---to raise me properly and save me from whatever depraved
existence I might have had with my biological parents.**

[SUNDAY, DECEMBER]{.small} 4, 2033

They have begun to let us alone more on Sundays after services. I
suppose they're tired of using up their own Sundays to lash us into
memorizing chapters of the Bible. After five or six hours of services
and a meal of boiled vegetables, we are told to rest in our quarters and
thank God for his goodness to us.

We aren't permitted to do anything. To do anything other than Bible
study would be, in their view, "work," and a violation of the Fourth
Commandment. We're to sit still, not speak, not repair our clothing or
our shoes---we're all in rags since all but two sets per person of our
clothing have been confiscated. We're allowed to read the Bible, pray,
and sleep. If we're caught doing anything more than that, we're lashed.

Of course, the moment we're left alone, we do as we like. We hold
whispered conversations, we clean and repair our things as best we can,
we share information. And I write. Only on Sundays can we do these
things in daylight.

We're permitted no electric light and no oil lamps, so we have only the
window for light. During the week, it's dark when we get up and dark
when we're shut in to sleep. During the week, we are machines---or
domestic animals.

The only conveniences we're permitted are a galvanized bucket which we
must all use as a toilet and a 20-liter plastic bottle of water fitted
with a cheap plastic siphon pump. We each have one plastic bowl from
which we both eat and drink. It's odd about the bowls. They're bright
shades of blue, red, yellow, orange, and green. They're the only
colorful things in our prison room---bright, cheerful lies. They're what
you see first when you walk in. Mary Sullivan calls them our dog dishes.
We hate them, but we use them. What choice do we have? Our only "legal"
individual possessions are our bowls, our clothing, our blankets---one
each---and our Camp Christian-issued paper King James Bibles.

On Sundays when we're fortunate enough to be let alone early, I take out
paper and pencil and use my Bible as a desk.

My writing is a way for me to remind myself that I am human, that God is
Change, and that I will escape this place. As irrational as the feeling
may be, my writing still comforts me.

Other people find other comforts. Mary Sullivan and Allie combine their
blankets and make love to one another late at night. It comforts them.
Their sleeping place is next to mine, and I hear them at it. They aren't
the only ones who do it, but they're the only pair so far that stays
together.

"Do we disgust you?" Mary Sullivan whispered to me one morning with
characteristic bluntness. We had been awakened later than usual and we
could just see each other in the half-light. I could see Mary sitting up
beside a still-sleeping Allie.

I looked at her, surprised. She's a tall woman---almost my
size---angular and bony, but with an interesting-looking, expressive
face. She looked as though she had always had plenty of hard, physical
work to do, but not always enough to eat. "Do you love my friend?" I
asked her.

She blinked, drew back as though she was about to tell me to mind my own
business or to go to hell. But after a moment, she said in her harsh
voice, "Of course I do!"

I managed a smile, although I don't know whether she could see it, and I
nodded. "Then be good to one another," I said. "And if there's trouble,
you and your sisters stand with us, with Earthseed." We're the strongest
single group among the prisoners. The Sullivans and the Gamas have
tended to group themselves with us, anyway, although nothing had been
said. Well, now I've said something, at least to Mary Sullivan.

After a moment, she nodded, unsmiling. She wasn't a woman who smiled
often.

I worry that someone will break ranks and report Allie and Mary, but so
far, no one has reported anyone for anything, although our "teachers"
keep inviting us to report one another's sins. There has been trouble
now and then. Squatter-camp women have gotten into fights over food or
possessions, and the rest of us stopped things before they got too
loud---before a "teacher" arrived and demanded to know what was going on
and who was responsible.

And there is one young squatter-camp woman, Crystal Blair, who seems to
be a natural bully. She hits or shoves people, takes their food or their
small possessions. She amuses herself by telling lies to cause fights.
("Do you know what she said about you? I heard her! She said...") She
snatches things from people, sometimes making no secret of what she's
doing. She doesn't want the pitiful possessions. Sometimes she makes a
show of breaking them. She wants the other women to know that she can do
what she damned well pleases, and they can't stop her. She has power,
and they don't.

We've taught her to let Earthseed women and our possessions alone. We
stood together, and let her know we're willing to make her life even
more of a misery to her than it already is. We discovered by accident
that all we had to do was hold her down and tug on her collar. The
collar punishes her, and it punishes me and the other sharers among us
if we were stupid enough to watch her suffering, but it leaves no marks.
If we use her clothing to tie and gag her, then with just an occasional
tug on her collar we can give her a hellish night. After we put her
through one such night, she let us alone. She tormented other women.
Tormenting people was her particular comfort.

We worry about her. She's crazier than most of us, and she's trouble,
but she hates our "teachers" more than we do. She won't go to them for
help. In time, though, one of her victims might. We watch her. We try to
keep her from going too far.

[SUNDAY, DECEMBER]{.small} 11, 2033

More new people have been brought here---ragged, scrawny people, all
strangers. Every day this week, a maggot has arrived to unload new
people in groups of three, four, or five. We've finished building a
long, shedlike extension onto the school with lumber that the "teachers"
trucked in. This extension is four bare rooms of shelf beds intended to
house 30 people each. Each wall is covered with three layers of shelves
plus an access ladder or two. Each shelf is to be a long, narrow bed
intended to sleep two people, usually either feet to feet or head to
head. The new people are each given what we have: a blanket, a plastic
bowl, a Bible, and a shelf where they must sleep and store their things.
We still sleep on the floor in our rooms, but everything else is the
same.

Like us, the new people are using buckets as toilets. Some of us are
being made to dig a cesspit. I took some lashes for pointing out that it
was being put in a bad place. It could contaminate the underground water
that feeds our wells. That could make us all sick, including our
"teachers."

But our "teachers" know everything. They don't need advice from a woman,
and a heathen woman at that. It was entirely their own decision a few
days later to relocate the cesspit downhill and far away from the wells.

Someone has put up a sign at the logging-road gate: "Camp Christian
Reeducation Facility." The Crusaders have surrounded the place with a
Lazor-wire fence, so there's no safe entry or exit except at the gate.
Lazor wire is made up of strands of wire so thin that they're hard to
see. They slice into the flesh of the wild animals who blunder into
them.

I've asked some of the strangers what's happening outside. Do people
know what a reeducation camp really is? Are there other camps? Is there
resistance? What's Jarret doing? What's going on?

Most of the new people won't talk to me. They're weary, frightened,
beaten people. Those who are willing to talk know only that they were
either arrested or snatched from their lives as squatters, drifters, or
petty crooks.

Several of the new people are sharers. "Bad seed if there ever was bad
seed," our "teachers" say. "The heathen children of drug addicts." They
treat known sharers as objects of suspicion, contempt, and ugly
amusement. They're so easy to torment. No challenge at all.

We have not given ourselves away, yet, we sharers of Earthseed. We've
worked hard at concealing ourselves, and, I admit, we've been lucky.
None of us has been pushed beyond our limits at a time when our
"teachers" might notice. All of us have had years of hiding in plain
sight to help us. Even the Mora girls, only 14 and 15, have managed to
hide what they are.

I kept up my search for someone who could tell me at least a little
about the outside. In the end, I didn't find my informant. He found me.
He was a young Black man, bone thin, scarred, careful, but not beaten
down. His name was David Turner.

"Day," he said when we found ourselves digging side by side in the
stupid, dangerous cesspit that was later abandoned. I think now that he
only spoke to me because we weren't supposed to speak.

I looked a question at him as I threw a shovelful of dirt out of the
hole.

"Name of David," he said. "Call me Day."

"Olamina," I said without thinking.

"Yeah?" he said.

"Yes."

"Different kind of name."

I sighed, glanced at him, liked the stubborn, unbeaten look of him, and
said, "Lauren."

He gave me a quick grin. "People call you Laurie?"

"Not if they expect me to answer," I said.

I guess we were a little careless. Above, one of our "teachers" lashed
me hard, and I convulsed and fell. I've noticed before that if a
collared man and woman are talking together, it's the woman who tends to
be lashed. Women are temptresses, you see. We drag innocent men into
trouble. From the time of Adam and Eve women have dragged innocent men
into trouble. Anyway, I was lashed hard, but only once. After that, I
was more careful.

Being lashed hard several times is enough to induce temporary
coordination problems and memory loss. Day told me later that he'd seen
a man lashed until the man didn't know his own name. I believe him. I
know that when I saw Bankole's dead body, and I turned on my bearded
guard, I had never in my life been more intent on killing another
person. I was dropped where I stood with a hard shock, then lashed
several more times, and Allie tells me that the way I jerked and flopped
around the ground, she thought I'd break my bones. I woke up very sore,
covered in bruises, sprains, abrasions, and bloody rock cuts, but that
wasn't the worst.

The worst was the way I felt afterward. I don't mean the physical pain.
This place is a university of pain. I mean what I wrote before. I was a
zombie for several days after the lashing. At first I couldn't even
remember that Bankole was dead. Natividad and Allie had to tell me that
all over again more than once. And I couldn't remember what had happened
to Acorn, why we were all shut up in one room of our own school, where
the men were, where the children were....

I haven't written about this until now. When I understood it, it scared
me to death. It scared me into mewling in a corner like a terrorized
three-year-old.

After surviving Robledo, I knew that strangers could appear and steal or
destroy everything and everyone I loved. People and possessions could be
snatched away. But somehow, it had not occurred to me that...that *bits
of my own mind* could be snatched away too. I knew I could be killed.
I've never had any illusions about that. I could be disabled. I knew
that too. But I had not thought that another person, just by pushing a
small button, then smiling and pushing it again and again....

He did smile, my bearded teacher. That came back to me later. All of it
came back to me. When it did....Well, that's when I retreated to my
corner, whimpering and moaning. The son of a bitch smiled and pressed
his button over and over as though he were fucking me, and he grinned
while he watched me groaning and thrashing.

My brother said a collar makes you envy the dead. As bad as that sounds,
it didn't, couldn't, convey to me, how a collar makes you hate. It
teaches you whole new magnitudes of utter hatred. I knew almost nothing
about hate until this thing was put around my neck. Now, sometimes it's
all I can do to stop myself from trying again to kill one of them and
then dying the way Emery did.

I've been talking off and on to Day Turner. Whenever we can, when we
pass one another or are put to work in the same general area, we've
talked. I've encouraged Travis and Harry and the other men to talk to
him. I think he'll tell us anything he can that will help us. This is a
summary of what he's passed on to us so far:

Day had walked over the Sierras from his last dead-end, low-paying job
in Reno, Nevada. He had drifted north and west, hoping to find at least
a chance to work his way out of poverty. He had no family, but for
protection, he walked with two friends. All had been well until he and
his friends reached Eureka. There, they had heard that one of the
churches offered overnight shelter and meals and temporary work to
willing men. The church was, no surprise, the Church of Christian
America.

The work was helping to repair and paint a couple of old houses that the
church intended to use as part of their orphaned-children's home. There
were no orphans on site---or none that Day saw, or I suppose we would
all have badgered him to death about our own children. You would think
that there were enough real orphans in this filthy world. How dare
anything that calls itself a church create new orphans with its maggots
and its collars?

Anyway, Day and his friends liked the idea of doing something for kids
and earning a few dollars as well as a bed and a few meals. But they
were unlucky. While they slept on their first night in the church's
men's dormitory, a small group of the men there tried to rob the place.
Day says he had nothing to do with robbery. He says he doesn't give a
damn whether we believe him or not, but that he's never stolen, except
to eat, and he'd never in his life steal from a church. He was raised by
a very religious uncle and aunt, now dead, and thanks to their early
training, there were some things he just wouldn't do. But the thieves
were said to be Black, and Day and his friends were Black, so Day and
his friends were presumed guilty.

I found myself believing him. That may be stupid of me, but I like him,
and he doesn't strike me as a liar or a church robber.

He says the church's security people swarmed over the dormitories, and
the men awoke and ran in all directions. They were all free poor men.
When trouble erupted, and there was no real profit to be had, most of
them never thought of doing anything other than getting
away---especially when the shooting started.

Day didn't have a gun. One of his friends did, but the three of them got
separated. Then they all got caught.

He and 18 or 20 other men were caught, and all the Black ones went to
jail. Some were charged with violent crimes---armed robbery and assault.
The rest were charged with vagrancy---which is a far more serious crime
than it once was. The vagrants were found guilty and indentured to the
Church of Christian America. Day's friends were charged with felonies as
part of the first group because they were found together and one had a
gun. Day was in the vagrant group. He had been indentured to work for 30
days for the church. He had already been shifted around and forced to
work for more than two months. They lashed him when he complained that
his sentence was up. At first they said he could go free if he could
prove he had a job waiting for him outside. Of course since he was a
stranger to the area, and since he had no free time to look for a job,
it was impossible for him to get outside work. Local vagrants, on the
other hand, were, one by one, rescued by relatives and friends, who
promised to either give them jobs or feed and house them so that they
would no longer be vagrant.

Day had done construction work, painting, groundskeeping, and janitorial
work. He had been given a thorough physical examination, then been
required to donate blood twice. He had been encouraged to offer to
donate a kidney or a cornea, after which he could heal and go free. This
terrified him. He refused, but he couldn't help knowing that his organs,
and, in fact, his life could be taken from him at any time. Who would
know? Who would care? He wondered why they had not killed him already.

Then they moved him to Camp Christian for reeducation. He was told that
there was hope for him---that he could, if he chose, learn to be a
servant of God and God's true church and a loyal citizen of the greatest
country in the world. He said he was already a Christian. They said, in
effect, "Prove it." They said he would be accepted among them when they
judged him truly penitent and educated in the truths of the Bible.

Then Day quoted them Exodus 21:16---"And he that stealeth a man and
selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to
death." Day was lashed for his choice of scripture, of course, and he
was told that the people of Christian America well knew that the devil
could quote scripture.

Most people don't know about the camps, Day says. He's learned from
talking to other collared men that there are a few small camps like Camp
Christian and at least two big ones---much bigger than Camp Christian.
One of the big ones is up at an abandoned prison in Del Norte County and
the other is down in Fresno County. People don't realize how free poor
vagrants are being treated, but he's afraid that even if they did know,
they wouldn't care. The likelihood is that people with legal residences
would be glad to see a church taking charge of the thieving,
drug-taking, drug-selling, disease-spreading, homeless free poor.

"Back when I was at home, my aunt and uncle would have felt like that,"
Day said. "We walk the highways and scrounge and scavenge and ask for
work, and all of that reminds people that what's happened to us can
happen to them. They don't like to think about stuff like that, so they
get mad at us. They make the cops arrest us or run us out of town. They
call us names and wish somebody would do something to make us disappear.
And now, somebody is doing just that!"

He's right. There are plenty of people who would think the Church was
doing something generous and necessary---teaching deadbeats to work and
be good Christians. No one would see a problem until the camps were a
lot bigger and the people in them weren't just drifters and squatters.
As far as we of Earthseed are concerned, that's already happened, but
who are we? Just weird cultists who practice strange rites, so no doubt
there are nice, ordinary people who would be glad to see us taught to
behave ourselves too.

How many people, I wonder, can be penned up and
tormented---reeducated---before it begins to matter to the majority of
Americans? How does this penning people up look to other countries? Do
they know? Would they care? There are worse things happening here in the
States and elsewhere, I know. There's war, for instance.

In fact, we are at war. The United States is at war with Alaska and
Canada. People are calling it the Al-Can war. I know Jarret wanted a
war, was working to get one started. But until Day told me, I hadn't
realized it had begun. There have already been exchanges of missiles and
a few vicious border battles. I told Allie about this later, and she
thought about it for a moment.

"Who's winning?" she asked.

I shook my head. "Day didn't tell me. Hell, I didn't ask."

She shrugged. "Yeah. It doesn't much matter to us, does it?"

"I don't know," I said.

We are roughly 250 inmates, and, by my most recent count, 20 guards.
Just think: if we could all move at the same time, 10 or l2 people per
guard, we might be able to...to....

We might be able to die like Teresa. Just one "teacher" could, with one
finger, send us all sprawling and writhing on the ground. We might be
able to die, every one of us, without doing much more than startling our
guards.

[SUNDAY, DECEMBER]{.small} 18, 2033

Now I have been raped.

It happened twice. Once on Monday, and again yesterday. It is my
Christmas gift from Christian America.

[SUNDAY, DECEMBER]{.small} 25, 2033

I need to write about what has been happening to me. I don't want to,
but I need to.

To be a sharer is to feel the pleasure and the pain---the apparent
pleasure and the apparent pain---of other people. There have been times
when I've felt the pleasure of one of our "teachers" when he lashed
someone. The first time it happened---or rather, the first time I
understood what was happening, I threw up.

When someone cries out in pain, I'm careful not to look. If I happen to
see someone double up, so far I've been able to lean against a wall or a
tool or a friend or a tree. Somehow, though, it never occurred to me
that I had to protect myself from the pleasures of our "teachers."

There are a few men here, though, a few "teachers," who lash us until
they have orgasms. Our screams and convulsions and pleas and sobs are
what these men need to feel sexually satisfied. I know of three who seem
to need to lash someone to get sexual pleasure. Most often, they lash a
woman, then rape her. Sometimes the lashing is enough for them. I don't
want to know this as clearly as I do know it, but I can't help myself.
These men feast on our pain---and they call us parasites.

Rape is done with a pretense of secrecy. After all, these men come to
the camp and do a tour of duty. Then at least some of them must go home
to their wives and kids. Except for Reverend Joel Locke and his three
top assistants, who work here full time, the men who come here still
live in the real world. They rape, but they pretend they don't. They say
they're religious, but power has corrupted even the best of them. I
don't like to admit it, but some of them are, in a strange way, decent,
ordinary men. I mean that they believe in what they are doing. They're
not all sadists or psychopaths. Some of them seem truly to feel that
collecting minor criminals in places like Camp Christian is right and
necessary for the good of the country. They disapprove of the rape and
the unnecessary lashings, but they do believe that we inmates are,
somehow, enemies of the country. Their superiors have told them that
parasites and heathens like us brought down "America the mighty."
America was the strongest country on Earth, but people like us went
whoring after foreign religions and refused to do our duty as citizens.
We women lost all modesty and offered ourselves in the streets, and the
men who should have controlled us became our pimps.

That's the short version of how evil we are and why we deserve to be in
collars. The other side of this picture is how our hardworking,
long-suffering "teachers" are trying to "help" us.

One of the men who has been after Jorge's sister Cristina specialized in
this strange, self-pitying attitude. He talked to her about his
wheelchair-bound wife, about his disrespectful children, about how poor
they all are. She says she begged him to let her alone, and he threw her
down and forced her. He said he was a loyal, hardworking Christian
American, and he was entitled to some pleasure in his life. But when he
had finished, he begged her to forgive him. Insanity.

My rape happened at the end of a very cold, rainy day. I had been given
cooking duties. This meant I got to clean myself up, stay warm and dry,
and, for once, get enough to eat. I was feeling both grateful for this
and ashamed of my gratitude. I worked with Natividad and two of the Gama
women, Catarina and Joan, and at the end of the day, we were all taken
away to the cabins and raped.

Of the four of us, only I was a sharer. Of the four of us, only I
endured not only my own pain and humiliation, but the wild, intense
pleasure of my rapist. There are no words to explain the twisted,
schizoid ugliness of this.

We can't bathe often enough. We get no hot water and little soap unless
we get kitchen duty. If we ask to be allowed to bathe, it's called
vanity. Yet we are viewed with disgust and contempt if we stink. We are
said to "stink with sin."

So be it.

I have decided to stink like a corpse. I have decided that I would
rather get a disease from being filthy than go on attracting the
attentions of these men. I will be filthy. I will stink. I will pay no
attention to my hair or my clothing.

I must do this, or I will kill myself.

**S[OMEHOW, MY MOTHER ENDURED]{.small} more than a year of slavery at
Camp Christian. How she did it, how she survived it, I can only guess
from her writings of 2033 and 2035. Her record of 2034 has been lost.
She did write during 2034. I have no doubt of that. She couldn't have
gone for a year without writing. I've found occasional references to
notes made then. No doubt by then, she was writing on whatever scraps of
paper she could find.**

**She obviously liked to keep her writing when she could, but I suspect
that somehow it helped her just to do it, whether she was able to keep
it or not. The act of writing itself was a kind of therapy.**

**The most important loss is this: There was at least one major escape
attempt. The people of Acorn took no part in it, but of course they
suffered for it later along with the rest of Camp Christian. Its leader
was the same David Turner that my mother had met and liked in 2033. I
know this because I've spoken to people who were there, who survived the
effort, and who remember the suffering.**

**My best informant was a plainspoken woman named Cody Smith, who in
December of 2034 had been arrested for vagrancy in Garberville and
transported to Camp Christian. She was one of the survivors of the
rebellion, although as a result of it, she suffered nerve damage and
eventual blindness. She was beaten and kicked as well as electronically
lashed. Here's her story as she told it to me:**

**"Day Turner's people were convinced that they could overwhelm the
guards by piling onto them three or more to one. They believed they
could kill the guards before their collars disabled them. Lauren Olamina
said no. She said the guards were never all together, were never all
outside at the same time. She said one guard missed was one guard who
could kill all of us with just one finger. Day liked her. I don't know
why. She was big like a man and not pretty, but he liked her. He just
didn't believe she was right. He thought she was scared. But he forgave
her because she was a woman. That drove her crazy. The more she tried to
talk him out of it, the more determined he was to do it. Then he asked
her if she was going to give him away, and she got really quiet and so
mad he actually took a step back from her. She could do that. She didn't
get loud when she got mad, she got real quiet. She scared people.**

**"She asked him who the hell did he think she was, and he said he was
starting to not be sure. There was some bad feeling after that. She
stopped talking to him and began talking to her own people. It was hard
to talk, dangerous to talk. It was against the rules. People had to
whisper and mutter and talk without moving their lips and not look at
the people they were talking to. They got lashed if they were caught.
Messages got passed from one person to another. Sometimes they got
changed or messed up and you couldn't tell what people were trying to
tell you. Sometimes someone told the guards. New people brought in from
the road would do that---tell what they had no business telling. They
got a little extra food for it or a warm shirt or something. But if we
caught them at it, they never did it again. We saw to that. There were
always a few, though. They did it for a reward or because they were
scared or because they had started to believe all those sermons and
Bible classes and prayer meetings and the other stuff they made us sit
through or stand through when we were almost too tired to live. I think
a few of the women did it so the guards would treat them better in bed.
Some guards liked to hurt you. So for us, talking was dangerous even if
no guard saw you do it.**

**"Anyway, it didn't seem that anyone gave Day Turner away. Lauren
Olamina just told her people that when it happened, they should lie
face-down on the ground with their hands behind their necks. Some of
them didn't want to. They thought Day was right. But she kept at them,
pushing them, asking them about lashings they had seen---one guard
lashing eight or nine people at the same time with just one
finger....She got herself lashed over and over, trying to talk to
them---to the men in her group especially. I think Day worked on them at
night when men and women were locked up separate. You know the kind of
shit men say to one another when they want to stop other men from
listening to a woman. From what I heard, Travis Douglas was the one who
kept Olamina's men in line. He wasn't all that big, but he had a force
to him. People trusted him, listened to him, liked him. And for some
reason, Travis trusted Olamina. He didn't like what she was telling them
to do, but he...like he believed in her, you know.**

**"When the break came, most of Olamina's people did what she had told
them to do. That saved them from being shot or from being beaten as
badly as the ones like me who didn't get on the ground fast enough.
Day's people started grabbing guards, and the Acorn people dropped like
stones. When the pain hit, they were already getting down on the ground,
all but a guy named King---Jeff King---big, good-looking blond guy---and
three women. Two were named Scolari---sisters or something---and Channa
Ryan. I knew Channa Ryan. She just couldn't stand it anymore. She was
pregnant, but not showing much yet. She figured if she died taking one
of the guards and a guard's baby with her, it would be a good deal.
There was this one particular guy---ugly son of a bitch who washed
himself maybe once a week. But he used to make her go to his cabin two
or three times a week. He had his fun with her. She wanted to get him.
She didn't, though.**

**"Day's people killed one guard. Just one, and it was a woman who got
him---that evil bitch Crystal Blair. She died for it, but she got him. I
don't know why she hated the guards so much. They didn't rape her,
didn't pay that much attention to her. I guess it was just that they
took her freedom. She was a big pain in the ass while she was alive, but
people kind of respected her after she was dead. She ripped that guard's
throat out with her teeth!**

**"Day's people hurt a couple of other guards, but it cost them 15 of
their own. Fifteen dead just to start with. Some others were lashed to
death or almost to death later. Some were kicked and stomped as well as
lashed. I was because I was too close to Crystal Blair when she killed
that one guard. Day got killed too, but not until later. Later, they
hanged him. By then, he was so busted up, I doubt he knew what was going
on. The rest of us got hurt, but not so bad. The ones who could walk had
to go out the next day to work. If we had headaches or teeth kicked in
or bad gashes or bruises from being kicked with boots, it didn't matter.
The guards said if they couldn't beat the devil out of us, they'd work
him out of us. The ones who couldn't walk disappeared. I don't know what
happened to them---maybe killed, maybe taken away for medical treatment.
We never saw them again. Everyone else worked for sixteen hours
straight. They lashed you if you stopped to pee. You had to just do it
on yourself and keep working. They did that for three days straight.
Work sixteen hours---dig a hole. Fill it up. Chop trees. Make firewood.
Dig another hole. Fill it up. Paint the cabins. Chop weeds. Dig a hole.
Fill it up. Drag rocks from the hills. Break them to gravel. Dig a hole.
Fill it up.**

**"A couple of people went crazy. One woman just fell down on the ground
and started screaming and crying. She wouldn't stop. The other one, a
big man with scars all over his face, he started running and
screaming---going nowhere, running in circles. They disappeared too.
Three days. We didn't get enough to eat. You never got enough to eat
unless you got kitchen duty. Every night they preached hellfire and
damnation at us and made us memorize Bible verses for at least an hour
before they'd let us sleep. Then it was like we hadn't slept at all and
they were getting us up to do it all again. It was hell. Plain hell. No
devil could have made a better one."**

**Cody Smith. She was an old woman when I met her---illiterate, poor,
and scarred. If her version of the break and its aftermath is true, it's
no wonder my mother never wrote much about it after her captivity. I've
never found anyone who heard her talk much about it.**

**But at least she got most of her own people through the rebellion. She
lost only three, and two others---the Mora sisters---had given away
their status as sharers. I wonder that all the sharers hadn't given
themselves away. On the other hand, when everyone is screaming, I
suppose sharers' screams don't draw special attention. I don't know how
the Moras gave themselves away, but Cody Smith and other informants have
told me they did. It may have been the reason that after the rebellion,
they were raped more often than the other women were. They never gave
any other sharer away.**

**That was my mother's 2034. I wouldn't have wished it on her. I
wouldn't have wished it on anyone.**

**What was done to my mother and to many other interned people of her
time was illegal in almost every way. It was never legal to collar
non-criminals, never legal to confiscate their property or separate
husband from wife or to force either to work without pay of some kind.
The matter of separating children from parents, however, might have been
managed almost legally.**

**Vagrancy laws were much expanded, and vagrant adults with children
could lose custody of the children, unless they were able to establish
homes for them within a specified period of time. In some counties,
job-placement help was available from churches and local businesses, and
the jobs had to provide at least room and board for the family, even if
there were no salary. Vagrant women often became unsalaried household
help or poorly paid surrogate mothers. In other counties, there was no
help at all for vagrants. They had to make a proper home for their
children or their children would be rescued from their inadequate, unfit
hands.**

**Not surprisingly, children were "rescued" this way much more often
from vagrants who were considered heathens than from those who were seen
as acceptable Christians. And "heathens" who were poor, but not true
vagrants, not homeless, might find themselves reclassified as vagrants
so that their**

**children could be placed in good Christian America homes. The idea, of
course, was to make good Christian Americans of them in spite of the
wickedness, or at best, the errors of their parents.**

**It's hard to believe that kind of thing happened here, in the United
States in the twenty-first century, but it did. It *shouldn't* have
happened, in spite of all the chaos that had gone before. Things were
healing. People like my mother were starting small businesses, living
simply, becoming more prosperous. Crime was down in spite of the sad
things that happened to the Noyer family and to Uncle Marc. Even my
mother said that things were improving. Yet Andrew Steele Jarret was
able to scare, divide, and bully people, first into electing him
President, then into letting him fix the country for them. He didn't get
to do everything he wanted to do. He was capable of much greater
fascism. So were his most avid followers.**

**For people like my mother, Jarret's fanatical followers were the
greater danger. During Jarret's first year in office, the worst of his
followers ran amok. Filled with righteous superiority and popular among
the many frightened, ordinary citizens who only wanted order and
stability, the fanatics set up the camps. Meanwhile, Jarret himself was
busy with the ridiculous, obscene Al-Can war. If Jarret's thugs weren't
locking poor people into collars, Jarret himself was seducing them into
the military and feeding them into what turned out to be a useless,
stupid exercise in destruction. The already-weakened country all but
collapsed. Too many Americans, whether or not they belonged to CA, had
family and friends in both Canada and Alaska. People deserted or left
the country to avoid the draft---there was one, at last---and the saying
was, during the war, that healthy young men were America's biggest
export.**

**There was much slaughter on both sides of the Canadian border and
there were air and naval attacks on the coastal cities of Alaska. The
war was like an exaggeration of the attempted breakout at Camp
Christian. Much blood was shed, but little was accomplished. The war
began in anger, bitterness, and envy at nations who appeared to be on
their way up just as our country seemed to be on a downward slide.**

**Then the war just petered out. At first, there was much fighting, much
destruction, much screaming and flag-waving. Then, gradually, over 2034,
a terrible, bitter weariness seemed to creep over people. Poor families
saw their sons drafted and killed, as they said, "for nothing!" It was
harder than ever to buy decent food. Much of our grain over the past few
years of climate change and chaos had been imported from Canada, after
all. In the end, in late 2034, peace talks began. After that, except for
a lot of hard feelings and occasional nasty incidents, the war was over.
The border between Canada and America stayed where it had been, and
Alaska remained an independent country. It was the first state to
officially, completely, successfully secede from the union. People were
saying that Jarret's home state of Texas would be next.**

**In less than a year, Jarret went from being our savior, almost the
Second Coming in some people's minds, to being an incompetent son of a
bitch who was wasting our substance on things that didn't matter. I
don't mean that everyone changed their feelings toward him. Many people
never did. My adopted parents never did, even though he cost them a
beautiful, intelligent, loving daughter. I grew up hearing about that
daughter endlessly. Her name was Kamaria, and she was perfect. I know
this because my mother told me about her at least once during every day
of my childhood. I could never look as good as Kamaria did or straighten
my room as well or do as well with my studies or even clean a toilet as
well---although I find it difficult to believe the perfect little bitch
ever cleaned a toilet---or used one.**

**I didn't know I was still bitter enough to write a thing like that. I
shouldn't be. It's foolish to hate someone you've never met, someone
who's never harmed you. I believe now that I shifted my resentment
safely onto Kamaria, who wasn't there, so that at least until my
adolescence, I could love Kayce Alexander. She was, after all, the only
mother I knew.**

**Kamaria Alexander died in a missile attack on Seattle when she was 11
years old, and my adopted parents never stopped blaming---and
hating---the Canadians in their grief for her. But they never blamed
Jarret---"that good man," "that fine man," "that man of God." Kayce
talked that way. So did her friends when she finally moved back to them
in Seattle where her neighborhood and her church were scarred, but still
standing. Madison Alexander barely spoke at all. He murmured agreement
with whatever Kayce said, and he felt me up a lot, but apart from that,
he was quiet. My strongest memory of him, when I was four or five, was
of his picking me up, putting me in his lap, and feeling me. I didn't
know why I didn't like this. I just learned early to stay out of his way
as much as I could.**

[FROM]{.small} *The Journals of Lauren Oya Olamina*

[SUNDAY, FEBRUARY]{.small} 25, 2035

I've been too cold and too miserable, and too sick to do much writing.
We've all had flu. We're made to work anyway. Four people died last week
during a long, cold rain. One was pregnant. She gave birth alone in the
mud. No one was allowed to help her. She and her baby both died. Two
were worked until they dropped. When they dropped, the teachers called
them lazy parasites and lashed them. During the night, they died---two
men. They were all strangers, highway paupers---"vagrants" who had been
forced to come here. They were sick and half-starved when they arrived.
Thanks to the cold, wet weather, the lack of heat in our barracks, and
the bad diet, we all catch any contagious disease brought to us from the
highway or from the towns. Even our "teachers" are suffering with colds
and flu. And when they suffer, they take their misery out on us.

All this, and one other thing has made us decide that the time has come
to make our own break---or die trying.

We have information---some of us have learned things from our rapists,
others just from keeping our eyes and ears open. Also, we have 23
knives---that is, Earthseed, the Sullivans and the Gamas have 23 knives.
That's more than one for each guard. Some we've stolen from the trash
heap where our "teachers" teach us wastefulness and slovenliness. Other
knives are just sharp bits of metal that we've found and wrapped with
tape or cloth to protect our hands. They're crude, but they'll cut a
human throat. As soon as we've shut our collars off, we'll use the
knives. If we're quick and if we move together as we've planned, we
should be able to surprise several of our guards before they even think
to use their maggots against us.

We know some of us will die in this. Maybe we'll all die. But the way
things are going, we'll die anyway. None of us know how long we're to be
kept collared. No one who's come here has been released. Even the few
people who try to suck up to the "teachers" when they don't have to are
still here, still collared. None of us have heard anything about what's
happened to our children. And most of us are sick. None of Earthseed has
died since Day's rebellion, but we're sick. And Allie...Allie might die.
Or she might be permanently brain damaged. She's one of the reasons I've
decided we've got to risk a breakout soon.

Allie and her lover Mary Sullivan were caught last Sunday.

No, I take that back. They weren't caught. They were betrayed. They were
betrayed by Beth and Jessica Faircloth. That's the worst. They were
betrayed by people who were part of us, part of Earthseed. They were
betrayed by people whom Allie and the rest of us had helped to rescue
from starvation and slavery back when they had nothing. We took them in,
and when their family decided to join Earthseed, when they had done
their probationary year, we Welcomed them.

I watched the betrayal. I couldn't stop it. I couldn't do anything. I'm
worthless these days, just worthless.

Last Sunday, we had the usual six hours of preaching, this time on the
evils of sexual sinfulness. First we heard from Reverend Locke, who runs
this place. Then we heard from Reverend Chandler Benton, a minister from
Eureka who sometimes drives out to inflict himself on us. Benton
preached a vicious and weirdly salacious sermon on the evil, depraved
wickedness of bestiality, incest, pedophilia, homosexuality, lesbianism,
pornography, masturbation, prostitution, and adultery. It went on and
on---stories from current news, Bible stories, long quotations of Old
Testament laws and punishments including death by stoning, the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the life and death of Jezebel,
disease, hellfire, on and on.

But there was nothing at all said about rape. The good Reverend Benton
himself has, during earlier visits, made use of both Adela Ortiz and
Cristina Cho. He goes to the cabin---once the Balter house---that is
reserved now for visiting VIPs and has the woman of his choice brought
to him.

We endure these sermons. They give us a chance to come in out of the
rain. We are allowed to sit down and not work. We aren't cold because
our "teachers" don't want to be cold. They build a big fire in the
school's fireplace once a week. And so for a few hours on Sundays, we
are warm, dry, and almost comfortable in our rows on the floor. We're
hungry, but we know we'll soon be fed. We're in a drowsy, passive state.
Without the rest we get on Sundays, several more of us would be dead.
I'm sure of that. Nevertheless, we're being preached at while we're in
that drowsy, passive state. I doze sometimes, though we're lashed if
we're caught sleeping. I sit up, lean against a wall, and I let myself
doze.

I didn't realize it, but the two female Faircloths, it seems, had begun
to listen. Worse, they had begun to believe, to be frightened, to be
converted. Or perhaps not. Perhaps they had other motives.

We're always being called upon to testify, to give public thanks for all
the kindness and generosity that God has shown us in spite of our
unworthiness. And we must confess that unworthiness and make a public
repentance and a public appeal for God's mercy. We have each been
required to do this many times. The more you yield, the more you are
required to yield. Our teachers know we don't mean it, know we act out
of fear of pain. We simply do as we are told. They hate us for this.
They look at us with unmistakable hatred, disgust, and contempt, and
they insist that it's love that they feel. Their God requires them to
love us, after all. And it's only love that makes them try so hard to
help us see the light. They say we're blinded by our own sinful
stubbornness to the love and the help that they offer. "Spare the rod
and spoil the child," they tell us, and we are, at best, still children
as far as morality is concerned.

Right.

Anyway, Reverend Benton issued a call to testify. Three people had been
ordered to testify. I was one of them. How I was selected, I don't know,
but a scrawny "teacher" with bad teeth had put his hand on my shoulder
before services began and ordered me to give testimony. The other two
who had been ordered to testify were Ed Gama and a red-haired, one-armed
woman, fresh from the highway. Her name was Teal, she had been with us
for less than a week, and she was afraid of her shadow. Ed and I have
done it before, so we went first to show the stranger what to do. This
was the usual practice. I gave thanks for my many blessings, then I
confessed to sinful thoughts, to anger, and to resistance to my teachers
who were only trying to help me. I apologized to God and to all present
again and again for my wickedness. I begged for forgiveness, begged for
the strength and the wisdom to do God's will.

That's how you do it. That's how I've done it for over a year.

When I finished, Ed did pretty much the same thing. He had his own
scripted list of sins and apologies. Teal was bright enough to do as we
had done, but she was very frightened. Her voice trembled, and she all
but whispered.

In his loud, nasty voice, Reverend Benton said, "Speak up, sister. Let
the church hear your testimony."

Tears spilled from the woman's eyes, but she managed to raise her voice
and repent and ask forgiveness for "all the things I have done wrong."
She must have forgotten the kind of thing that the sermons had
"suggested" she confess to. Then she collapsed to her knees and began to
sob, out of control, terrified, begging, "Don't hurt me. Please don't
hurt me. I'll do anything."

If I had tried to go to her, help her up, and take her back to her space
on the floor, I would have been lashed. Human decency is a sin here. Ed
and I looked at each other, but neither of us dared to touch her. I
suspect that some "teacher" would have helped her back to her place.
Lashing her back to her place wouldn't be quite the thing to do under
the circumstances.

But there was an interruption. Beth and Jessica Faircloth had gotten up
and were picking their way through the congregation, trying not to step
on anyone, heading for the altar. When they reached the altar, they fell
to their knees. People did this sometimes, gave voluntary testimony in
hope of currying favor with the "teachers." It was harmless---or had
always been harmless before. And it might buy you a piece of bread or an
apple later. In fact, the Faircloths had done it several times. Some of
us sneered at them for it, but it had never seemed important to me.
Stupid me.

"We've sinned too," Beth cried. "We didn't mean to. We didn't know what
to do. We knew it was wrong, but we were afraid."

They were not lashed. I saw Reverend Benton hold up his hand, no doubt
telling the "teachers" to let them alone. "Speak, sisters," he said.
"Confess your sin. God loves you. God will forgive."

They didn't follow the form this time. Instead they spoke the way they
do when they're afraid, when they know they've done something other
people might not like, when they're standing together against others.
They're not twins. In fact, they're 18- and 19-year-old sisters, but
under stress, they act much younger, and they act like twins, finishing
one another's sentences, speaking in unison, or repeating one another's
words. Their testimony was like that.

"We saw them doing it," Beth said.

"They've been doing it for a long time now," Jessica added. "We saw
them."

"At night," Beth continued. "We knew it was wrong."

"It's dirty and filthy and perverted!" Jessica said.

"You can hear them kissing and making noises," Beth said, making a face,
to show her disgust. "Perverted!"

"I never knew Allie was like that, but even before you came to teach us,
she lived with another woman," Jessica said. "I thought she was okay
because she had a little boy, but now I know she wasn't."

"She must have been doing it with women all the time," Beth echoed.

"Now she does it with Mary Sullivan." Jessica had begun to cry. "It's
wrong, but we were afraid to tell before."

"She's strong like a man, and she's mean," Beth said. "We're afraid of
her."

And I thought, *Oh no*, *damnit*, *no*! Our "teachers" have mistreated
us every day, humiliated us and harangued us. But the misery has gone on
for so long, and the sermons have gone on for so long, and we've stood
together against it all....

But I suppose something like this was bound to happen sooner or later. I
only wish the traitors had been strangers from outside. That's happened
before in lesser ways, but after a night or two, we've always managed to
teach outsiders to keep their mouths shut about anything they've seen
among their fellow inmates. No member of Earthseed has ever betrayed us
in any way---until now.

As Allie was dragged to the front of the room to be punished, she
shouted at Beth and Jessica, "They'll still rape you, and they'll still
lash you and when they're done with you they'll still kill you!"

And I screamed at them, "She gave you food when you were hungry!"

So the "teachers" lashed me too.

But what they did to Allie and to Mary Sullivan, that went on and on.
Mary Sullivan's father Arthur begged them to stop, managed to hit one of
them and knock him down. So, of course he was lashed. But he bought no
mercy for his daughter. Mary was having terrible convulsions, and they
went on lashing her. They lashed both women until neither could scream
anymore. They made us watch. I didn't watch. To survive, I kept my head
down, my eyes half shut. I've been lashed for this behavior from time to
time, but not today. Today, all attention was on the two "sinners."

They lashed Allie and Mary until Mary died.

They lashed them until Allie was lost somewhere within herself. She
hasn't spoken a full sentence since the lashing.

Because I spoke for Allie, I was made to dig Mary's grave. Better me
than Mary's father. He isn't in his right mind either. He was forced to
watch his child tortured to death. He just wanders around, staring. Our
teachers lash him, and he screams from the pain, but when they finish,
he's no different. They seem to think they can torture him into
forgetting his terrible grief and his hate.

I can't stand this. I can't. I don't care if they kill me. I will break
free of this or I will be dead.

The Faircloth girls have been given a room in what used to be the King
house. They have a whole room to themselves now instead of a room shared
with thirty other women. They still wear collars, but they're on
permanent cooking duty now. They don't have to chop wood or do fieldwork
or construction work or clear brush or dig wells or graves or do any of
the other hard, heavy, dirty work that the rest of us must do. And they
don't know how to cook. Somehow, they've never learned to put together a
decent meal. So they don't cook for our "teachers." They just cook for
us. Of course, they're hated. No one talks to them, but no one does
anything to them either. We've been warned to let them alone. And they
have been given a certain power over us. They can season our food with
spit or dirt or shit, and we know it. Maybe that's what they're doing,
and that's why the food is so much worse than it was. I didn't think
that was possible---for it to get worse. The Faircloths have managed to
ruin garbage. The Sullivan brothers and sisters might kill both
Faircloth girls if they get the chance. Old Arthur Sullivan has been
sent away. We don't know where. He's out of his mind and our "teachers"
weren't able to lash him back to sanity, so they got rid of him.

We've learned that the master unit, the unit that powers or controls all
the collars in Camp Christian, is in my old cabin. For months it was
kept in one of the maggots---or we heard that's where it was kept. We've
had to put together hints, rumors, and overheard comments, any of which
might be misinterpreted, or untrue. But at long last, I believe we have
it right.

Reverend Locke's two assistants live in my cabin, and from time to time,
some of us are taken there for the night. The next time that happens,
we'll make our break.

The women who have been taken there most often are Noriko, Cristina Cho,
and the Mora girls.

"They say they like small, ladylike women," Noriko says with terrible
bitterness. "Those flabby, ugly men. They like us because it's easy for
them to hurt us. They like to use their hands, leave bruises, make you
beg them to stop."

She, Cristina, and the Moras all say they would rather risk death than
go on with things as they are. Whichever of them is taken to my cabin
next will cut their rapists' throats during the night. They can do that
now. I don't believe they could have a few months ago. Then they will
try to find and disable the master unit. Problem is, we don't know what
the master unit looks like. None of us has ever seen it.

All we know---or think we know about it---we've learned from those among
us who have been collared before. They say once you disable the master
unit, the smaller units won't work. The only way I can understand this
is to compare it to one of the phones in the Balter house down south in
Robledo, so long ago. This was a big, old-fashioned dinosaur of a
"cordless" phone. You had to plug the base unit into an electrical
outlet and a phone jack. Then you could walk around the house and yard
talking into the hand unit. But unplug the two cords of the base, and
the hand unit didn't work anymore. I'm told that that's close to what
happens with a network of collars.

I don't know anything for sure. I only half believe that we can do what
we think we can and survive. Tampering with the master unit might kill
the woman who does it. It might kill us all. But the truth is, we
couldn't last much longer, no matter what. We're only just human
now---most of us. I've said this to the people I trust---people who have
helped me gather the fragments of information that we have. I've asked
each of them if they're willing to take the risk.

They are. We all are.

[WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY]{.small} 28, 2035

Day before yesterday, we had a terrible storm---truly terrible. And yet,
it was a wonderful thing: wind and rain and cold...and a landslide. The
hill where our cemetery once was with all its new and old trees, that
hill has slumped down into our valley. Our teachers had made us cut down
the older trees for firewood and lumber and God. I never found out how
they came to believe we prayed to trees, but they went on believing it.
We begged them to let the hill alone, told them it was our cemetery, and
they lashed us. Because they forced us to do this, the hillside has
broken away and come rumbling down to us. It has buried a maggot and
three cabins, including the cabin that Bankole and I had built and then
lived in for our six brief years together.

Also, it buried the men who slept alone in that cabin. I'm sorry to say
that there were two women in each of the other cabins. They were from
squatter camps. Natividad had been friendly with one of them, but I
didn't know them at all. They are dead, however, buried and dead. Six
"teachers," four captive women, *and all of our collars* were dead. Last
Sunday, we resolved to free ourselves or die trying. Now, instead, the
weather, and our "teachers' " own stupidity has freed us.

Here is what happened.

The storm began as a cold rain whipped by a brisk wind on Monday
afternoon, and for a while, we were made to go on working in it. At
last, though, our "teachers," who are much more willing to inflict
suffering than to endure it, drove us back to our prison rooms to sit in
the cold dimness while they went to our cabins, to warm fires, light,
and food.

After a while, the lowest-ranking "teacher" brought Beth and Jessica
Faircloth out with our disgusting dinner---a lot of half-boiled,
half-spoiled cabbage with potatoes.

We had put Allie where the Faircloths could not avoid seeing her, being
confronted by her when they came in. She is a little better. I've looked
after her as best I could. She walks like a bent old woman, talks in
monosyllables, and does not always seem to understand when we speak to
her. I don't believe she even remembers what the Faircloths did to her,
but she seems to trust me. I told her to watch them---watch them every
second.

She did.

The Faircloths trembled and stumbled over one another, putting down pots
of awful food and backing out. We all stared at them in silence, but I
suspect they only saw Allie.

After dinner, we rested as best we could, feeling cold, stiff,
miserable, and damp on the bare wood floor wrapped in our filthy
blankets. Some of us slept, but the storm grew much worse, shaking the
building and making it creak. Rain beat against the window and blew
roofing off cabins, limbs off trees, and trash from the dump that the
teachers had made us create. We had had no dump before. We had a salvage
heap and a compost heap. Neither was trash. We could not afford to be
wasteful. Our teachers have made trash of our entire community.

Sometimes there was lightning and thunder, sometimes only heavy rain. It
went on all night, tearing the world apart outside. Then sometime this
morning before dawn, not long after I had managed to get to sleep, I was
awakened by a terrible noise. It wasn't like thunder---wasn't like
anything I'd ever heard. It was just this incredible rumbling, breaking,
cracking noise.

I reacted without thinking. My place is near the window, and I jumped up
and looked out. I leaned against the sill and peered out into the
darkness. A moment later there was a flare of lightning, and I saw rock
and dirt where my cabin should have been. Rock and dirt.

It took me a moment to understand this. Then I realized that I was
leaning against the windowsill, leaning halfway out the window. And I
had not convulsed and fallen to the floor. No pain. None of that filthy,
twisting agony that made us all slaves.

I touched my collar. It was still there, still capable of delivering the
agony. But for some reason, it no longer cared that I leaned against the
windowsill. In the dark room, I reached for Natividad. She slept on one
side of me and Allie slept on the other. Natividad trusts me, and she
knows how to be quiet.

"Freedom!" I whispered. "The collars are dead! They're dead!"

She let me lead her to the door between our quarters and the men's. We
managed to get there, each of us waking people as we went, whispering to
them, but not stepping on anyone, feeling our way. At the door,
Natividad pulled back a little, then she let me lead her through. The
door's never been locked. Collars were always enough to keep everyone
away from it. But not this time.

No pain.

We woke the men---those who were still asleep. We couldn't see well
enough to wake only the men we trusted. We woke them all. We couldn't do
this with silent stealth. We were quiet, but they awoke in confusion and
chaos. Some were already awake and confused and grabbing me, and
realizing that I was a woman. I hit one who wouldn't let me go---a
stranger from the road.

"Freedom!" I whispered into his face. "The collars are dead! We can get
away!"

He let me go, and scrambled for the door. I went back and gathered the
women. When I got them into the men's room, the men were already pouring
out of the building. We followed them through the big outside doors.
Travis and Natividad, Mike and Noriko, others of Earthseed, the Gamas,
and the Sullivans somehow found one another. We all clustered together,
male and female members of families greeting one another, crying,
hugging. They had not been able even to touch one another through the
eternity of our captivity. Seventeen months. Eternity.

I hugged Harry because neither of us had anyone left. Then he and I
stood together watching the others, probably feeling the same mixture of
relief and pain. Zahra was gone. Bankole was gone. And where were our
children?

But there was no time for joy or grief.

"We've got to get into the cabins now," I said, all but herding them
before me. "We've got to stop them from fixing the collars. We've got to
get their guns before they know what's going on. They'll waste time
trying to lash us. Groups of four or more to a cabin. Do it!"

We all know how to work together. We've spent years working together. We
separated and went to the houses. Travis, Natividad, and I grabbed the
Mora girls and we burst into what had been the Kardos house just as the
screaming began outside.

Some of our "teachers" came rushing out of their cabins to see what was
wrong, and they were torn to pieces by the people they had so enjoyed
tormenting.

Some of the captives, desperate to escape while they could, tried to
find their way through the Lazor wire in the dark, and the wire cut
their flesh to the bone when they ran into it.

Earthseed made no such lethal mistake. We went into the cabins to arm
ourselves, to rid ourselves of our "teachers," and to cut off our damned
collars.

My group piled onto the two "teachers" who were there, out of bed, one
with his pants and shirt on, and one in long underwear. They could have
shot us. But they were so used to depending on their belts to protect
them that it was the belts they tried to reach.

One stood and said, "What's going on?" The other lunged at Natividad and
me with a wordless shout.

We grappled with them, dragged them down, and strangled them. That
simple. Even simple for me. It hurt when they hit me. It hurt when I hit
them. And it didn't matter a good goddamn! Once I had my hands on one of
them, I just shut my eyes and did it. I never felt their deaths. And I
have never been so eager and so glad to kill people.

We couldn't see them very well anyway in the dark cabin, but we made
sure they were dead. We didn't let go of them until they were very, very
dead. Our makeshift knives were still in the walls and floor of our
barracks, but our hands did the job.

And then we had guns. We used a chair, then a night table to smash open
a gun cabinet.

More important, then we had wire cutters.

Tori Mora found the cutters in what had once been Noriko Kardos's
silverware drawer. Now it was full of small hand tools. We took turns
cutting one another's collars off. As long as we wore them, we were in
terrible danger. I was afraid every minute, anticipating the convulsing
agony that could end our freedom, begin our final torture. Our
"teachers" would kill us if they regained control of us. They would kill
us very, very slowly. The collars alone would kill us if they somehow
switched back on while we were trying to cut through them and twist them
off. I had learned over the months that nothing was more tamperproof
than a functioning collar.

I cut the Mora girls' collar off, and Tori cut off mine. Travis and
Natividad did the same for one another. And then we were free. Then, no
matter what, we were truly free. We all hugged one another again. There
was still danger, still work to do, but we were free. We allowed
ourselves that moment of intense relief.

Then we went out to find that our people and some of the others had
finished the job. The teachers were all dead. I saw that some of the
inmates still wore their collars, so I went back into the Kardos cabin
for the wire cutters. Once people realized what I was doing---cutting
off collars---both outsiders and members of the Earthseed community made
a ragged line in front of me. I spent the next several minutes cutting
off collars. It was cold, the wind was blowing, but at least it had
stopped raining. The eastern sky was beginning to brighten with the
dawn. We were free people, all of us.

Now what?

We stripped what we could from the cabins. We had to. The outsiders were
running around grabbing things, tearing or smashing whatever they didn't
want, screaming, cheering, ripping curtains from windows, breaking
windows, grabbing food and liquor. Amazing how much liquor our
"teachers" had had.

We took guns first. We didn't try to stop the outsiders from their orgy
of destruction, but we did guard the things we collected: guns,
ammunition, clothing, shoes, food. Outsiders understood that. We were
like them, taking what we wanted and guarding it. Some of them had found
guns, too, but there was a respectful wariness between us. Even people
who got crazy drunk didn't come after us.

Someone shot the locks off the gate, and people began to leave.

Several people tried to shoot their way into the single unburied maggot,
but it was locked and impervious to any effort we could make. In fact,
if even one of our "teachers" had slept in the maggot, he could have
defeated our escape. He could have killed us all.

Our own trucks were long gone. One had been destroyed when Gray Mora
said his final "no" to slavery. The other had been taken and driven
away. We had no idea where.

When it was light, I counted seven people dead on the Lazor wire. I
suspect most had bled to death, although two had opened their own
abdomens, even slicing into their intestines propelled by their mindless
lunge for freedom. Lazor wire is impossible to see at night in the rain,
and even the lowest street pauper should know the dangers of it. When we
were ready to leave, I collected Allie, who had stayed inside the school
and just stood at a window, staring out at us. I cut off her collar,
then I thought about the Faircloths. I had not cut off their collars.
They had not come to me. The two Faircloth boys, of course, had been
taken away with the rest of our young children. Alan Faircloth, the
father of Beth and Jessica, must have taken his daughters and slipped
away---or perhaps the Sullivans had found them and taken their revenge.

I sighed. Either the girls were dead or they were with Alan. Best to say
nothing. There had been enough killing.

I gathered what was left of the Earthseed community around me. The sun
wasn't visible through the clouds, but the wind had died down, and the
sky was pale gray. It was cold, but for once, with our fresh clothing,
we were warm enough.

"We can't stay here," I told my people. "We'll have to take as much as
we can carry and go. The church will send people here sooner or later."

"Our homes," Noriko Kardos said in a kind of moan.

I nodded. "I know. But they're already gone. They've been gone for a
long time." And a particular Earthseed verse occurred to me.

*In order to rise*

*From its own ashes*

*A phoenix*

*First*

*Must*

*Burn.*

It was an apt Earthseed verse, but not a comforting one. The problem
with Earthseed has always been that it isn't a very comforting belief
system.

"Let's take one last look through the houses," I said. "We need to look
for evidence of what they've done with our children. That's the most
important thing we can do next: find the children."

I left Michael and Travis to guard the goods we had collected, and the
rest of us went in groups to search the ruins of the houses.

But we found nothing that related to the children. There was money
hidden here and there around the cabins, missed by the marauding
inmates. There were piles of religious tracts, Bibles, lists of
"inmates" brought from Garberville, Eureka, Arcata, Trinidad, and other
nearby towns. There was a plan for spring planting, a few books written
by President Jarret, or by some ghostwriter. There were personal papers,
but nothing about our children, and no addresses. None. Nothing. This
could only be deliberate. They feared being found out. Was it us they
feared, or someone else?

We searched until almost midday. Then we knew we had to go, too. The
roads were mud and water, and it was unlikely that anyone would try to
drive up today, but we needed to get a good start. In particular, I
wanted to go to our secret caches where we had not only the necessities
but copies of records, journals, and in two places, the hand and foot
prints of some of our children. Bankole took hand and foot prints of
every child he delivered. He labeled them, gave a copy to the parents,
and kept a copy. I had distributed these copies among two of our
caches---the two that only a few of us knew about. I don't know whether
the prints will help us get our children back. When I let myself think
about it, I have to admit that I don't know even whether our children
are alive. I only know that now I have to get to those two caches. They
are back in the mountains toward the sea, not toward the road. We can
disappear in that country. There are places there where we can shelter
and decide what to do. It's one thing to say that we must find our
children, and another to figure out how to do that, how to begin. Who to
trust?

We burned Acorn. No. No, we burned Camp Christian. We burned Camp
Christian so that it couldn't be used as Camp Christian anymore. If
Christian America still wants the land it stole from us, it will have
some serious rebuilding to do. We spread lamp oil and diesel fuel inside
the cabins that we built from the trees we cut and the stone and
concrete we hauled. We spread oil in the school Grayson Mora had
designed and we had all worked so hard to build and make beautiful. We
spread it on the bodies of our "teachers." All that we could not take
with us, all that the other inmates had not taken or destroyed, we
burned. The buildings might not burn to the ground because the rain had
soaked everything, but they would be gutted and unsafe. The furniture
that we had built or salvaged would burn. The hated flesh would burn.

So, once more, we watched our homes burn. We went into the hills,
separating from the last of the other inmates, who went their own ways
back to the highway or wherever else they might want to go. From the
hills, for a time, we watched. Most of us had seen our homes burn
before, but we had not been the ones to set the fires. This time,
though, it's too late for fire to be the destroyer that we remembered.
The things that we had created and loved had already been destroyed.
This time, the fires only cleansed.

From EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

**We have lived before.**

**We will live again.**

**We will be silk,**

**Stone,**

**Mind,**

**Star.**

**We will be scattered,**

**Gathered,**

**Molded,**

**Probed.**

**We will live**

**And we will serve life.**

**We will shape God**

**And God will shape us**

**Again,**

**Always again,**

**Forevermore.**

**T[HE CRUSADERS DELIBERATELY DIVIDED]{.small} siblings because if they
were together, they might support one another in secret heathen
practices or beliefs. But if each child was isolated and dropped into a
family of good Christian Americans, then each would be changed. Parent
pressure, peer pressure, and time would remake them as good Christian
Americans.**

**Sometimes it did, even among the older children of Acorn. Look at the
Faircloth boys. One became a Christian American minister. The other
rejected Christian America completely. And sometimes the division was
utterly destructive. Some of us died of it. Ramon Figueroa Castro
committed suicide because, according to one of his foster brothers, "He
was too stubborn to try to fit in and forget about his sinful past."
Christian America was, at first, much more a refuge for the ignorant and
the intolerant than it should have been. Even people who would never
beat or burn another person could treat suddenly orphaned or abducted
children with cold, self-righteous cruelty.**

**"Give in," my mother said to the adults of Acorn. "Do as you're told
and keep your own council. Don't give them excuses to hurt you. Bide
your time. Watch your captors. Listen to them. Collect information, pool
it, and use it against them." But we kids never heard any of this. We
were snatched away and given alone into the hands of people who believed
that it was their duty to break us and remake us in the Christian
American image. And, of course, breaking people is much easier than
putting them together again.**

**So much agony caused, so much evil done in God's name.**

**And yet, Christian America had begun by trying to help and to heal as
well as to convert. Long before Jarret was elected President, his church
had begun to rescue children. But in those early days, they only rescued
kids who really needed help. Along the Gulf Coast where Jarret began his
work, there were several Christian American children's homes that were
over a decade old by 2032. These homes collected street orphans, fed
them, cared for them, and raised them to be "the bulwark of Christian
America." Only later did the fanatics take over and begin stealing the
children of "heathens" and doing terrible harm.**

**In preparation for this book, I spoke with several people who were
raised in "CA" children's homes or were adopted from CA homes into CA
families. What they told me reminded me of my own life with the
Alexanders. The homes and adoptive families were not meant to be cruel.
Even in the homes, there were no collars except as punishment for the
older children, and then only after warnings and lesser punishments had
failed. The homes weren't kept by sadists or perverts but by people who
believed deeply in what they were doing---or at least by workers who
wanted very much to please their employers and keep their jobs. The
believers wanted "their" children to believe absolutely in God, in
Jarret and in being good Christian American soldiers ready to do battle
with every sort of anti-American heathenism. The mercenaries were easier
to please. They wanted no children injured or killed while they were on
duty. They wanted the required lessons learned, the required tests
passed. They wanted peace.**

**The Alexanders were like a combination of the believer and the
mercenary. The Alexanders wanted me to believe, and if they did not love
me, at least they took care of me. By the time I was old enough for
school---Christian American school, of course---I had learned to be
quiet and keep out of their way. When I succeeded at this, Kayce and
Madison would reward me by letting me alone. Kayce took a break from
telling me how much inferior I was to Kamaria. Madison took a break from
trying to get his sweaty hands under my dress. I would take a book to a
quiet corner of the house or yard and read. My earliest books were all
either Bible stories or stories of Christian American heroes who, like
Asha Vere, did great deeds for the faith. These influenced me. How could
they not? I dreamed of doing great deeds myself. I dreamed of making
Kayce so proud of me, making her love me the way she loved Kamaria. Both
my biological parents were big, strong people. Thanks to them, I was
always big for my age, and strong---one more strike against me, since
Kamaria had been "small and dainty." I dreamed of doing great, heroic
things, but all I really tried to do was hide, vanish, make myself
invisible.**

**It should have been hard for an oversized kid like me to hide that
way, but it wasn't. If I did my chores and my homework, I was encouraged
to vanish---or rather, I wasn't encouraged to do anything else. In my
neighborhood there were only a few kids, and they were all older than I
was. To them I was either a nuisance or a pawn. They ignored me or they
got me into trouble. Kayce and her friends didn't appreciate any
attempts I made to join in their adult conversation. Even when Kayce was
alone, she wasn't really interested in anything I had to say. She either
told me more than I wanted to know about Kamaria, or she punished me for
asking questions about anything else.**

**Quiet was good. Questioning was bad. Children should be seen and not
heard. They should believe what their elders told them, and be content
that it was all they needed to know. If there were any brutality in the
way I was raised, that was it. Stupid faith was good. Thinking and
questioning were bad. I was to be like a sheep in Christ's flock---or
Jarret's flock. I was to be quiet and meek. Once I learned that, my
childhood was at least physically comfortable.**

[SUNDAY, MARCH]{.small} 4, 2035

So much has happened....

No, that's wrong. Things haven't just happened. I've caused them to
happen. I must get back to normal, to knowing and admitting, at least to
myself, when I cause things. Slaves are always told that they've caused
something bad, done something sinful, made stupid mistakes. Good things
were the acts of our "teachers" or of God. Bad things were our fault.
Either we had done some specific wrong or God was so generally
displeased with us that He was punishing the whole camp.

If you hear nonsense like that often enough for long enough, you begin
to believe it. You weight yourself down with blame for all the world's
pain. Or you decide that you're an innocent victim. Your masters are at
fault or God is or Satan is---or maybe things just happen on their own.
Slaves protect themselves in all sorts of ways.

But we're not slaves anymore.

I've done this: I sent my people away. We survived slavery together, but
I didn't believe that we could survive freedom together. I broke up the
Earthseed community and sent its parts in all directions. I believe it
was the right thing to do, but I can hardly bear to think about it. Once
I've written this, perhaps I can begin to heal. I don't know. All I know
now is that I've torn a huge hole in myself. I've sent away those who
mean most to me. They were all I had left, and I know I may not see them
ever again.

On Tuesday we escaped from Camp Christian, burning the camp and our
keepers as we went. We left behind the bones of our dead and the dream
of Acorn as the first Earthseed community. The Sullivans and the Gamas
went their own ways. We would not have asked them to leave us, but I was
glad they did. We had between us only the money in our caches and the
money we had taken from our "teachers." Since we are all now homeless,
jobless, and on foot, that money won't go far.

I did ask both families who were going to stay with relatives or friends
to get whatever information they could about the children, about the
legality of the camp, about the existence of other camps. We all must
find out what we can. I've asked them to leave word with the Holly
family. The Hollys were neighbors, more distant than the Sullivans and
the Gamas, but neighbors. They were good friends of the Sullivans, and
there was no rumor of their having been enslaved. We must be careful not
to get them into trouble, but if we are careful, and if we check with
them now and then, we can all exchange information.

Problem is, we didn't dare take any of the phones from Camp Christian.
The outsiders took some of them, but we were afraid we could somehow be
traced if we used them. We can't take the chance of being collared
again. We might be enslaved for life or executed because we've killed
good Christian American citizens. The fact that those citizens had
stolen our homes, our land, our freedom, and our children just might be
overlooked if the citizens were influential enough. We believe it could
happen. Look what had already happened! We're all afraid.

Among ourselves---Earthseed only---we've agreed on a place that we can
use as a message drop. It's down near what's left of Humboldt Redwoods
State Park. There any of us can leave information to be read, copied,
and acted on by the rest of us. It's a good place because we all know
where it is and because it's isolated. Getting to it isn't easy. We
don't dare leave information or meet in groups in some more convenient
place near the highway or near local roads, and we need a way of
reaching one another without depending on the Hollys. We'll check with
them, but who knows how they'll feel about us now. We'll communicate
among ourselves by leaving messages at our secret place, and perhaps by
meeting there.

But I'm going too fast. We had some time together after leaving Camp
Christian.

We walked deeper into the mountains, away from paved roads, south and
west to the largest of our caches where we knew there was the cold
shelter of a small cave. At the cave, we rested and shared the food that
we had brought from Camp Christian. Then we dug out the supplies that we
had stored in heavy, heat-sealed plastic sacks and stored there. That
gave us all packets of dried foods---fruit, nuts, beans, eggs, and
milk---plus blankets and ammunition. Most important, I passed out the
infant foot and hand prints that had been stored at this particular
cache to the parents present. I gave the Mora girls their younger
brothers' prints and they sat staring at them, each holding one. Both
their parents were dead. They have only each other and their little
brothers, if they can find them.

"They should be with us!" Doe muttered. "No one has the right to take
them from us."

Adela Ortiz folded her son's prints and put them inside her shirt. Then
she folded her arms in front of her as though cradling a baby. Larkin's
prints and those of Travis and Natividad's kids were at a different
location, but I found the prints of Harry's kids, Tabia and Russell, and
I gave them to Harry. He just sat looking at them, frowning at them and
shaking his head. It was as though he were trying to read an explanation
in them for all that had happened to him. Or maybe he was seeing the
faces of his children, and Zahra's face, long gone.

We sat warming ourselves around the fire we had finally dared to start.
We had collected wood outside during the last hour of daylight, but we
waited until it was dark to try to use it. The wood was wet and wouldn't
burn at first. When we did get a small fire going, it seemed to make
more smoke than heat. We hoped no one would see the smoke sliding up and
out of the cave, or that if people did see it, they would think it was
from one of the many squatter camps in the mountains. In winter, these
mountains are cold, wet, uncomfortable places, difficult places in which
to live without modern conveniences, but they're also places where
sensible people mind their own business.

I sat with Harry and he went on staring at the prints and shaking his
head. Then he began to rock back and forth. His expression in the
firelight seemed to crack, to break down, somehow, unable to hold itself
together.

I pulled him to me and held him while he cursed and cried in a harsh,
strained, whisper. I realized at some point that I was crying too. I
think that within ourselves, we both howled, but somehow, we never got
much above a whisper, a rasp. I could feel the howling straining to get
out of my throat, the screams that came out as small, ragged cries, his
and mine. I don't know how long we sat together, holding one another,
going mad inside ourselves, wailing and moaning for the dead and the
lost, unable to contain for one more minute 17 months of humiliation and
pain.

We wept ourselves to sleep like tired children. The next day Natividad
told me she and Travis had done much the same thing. The others, alone
or in groups, had found their own comfort in cathartic weeping, deep
sleep, or frantic, furtive love-making at the back of the cave. We were
together at last, comforting one another, and yet I think each of us was
alone, straining toward the others, some part of ourselves still trapped
back in the uncertainty and fear, the pain and desolation of Camp
Christian. We strained toward some kind of release, some human contact,
some way into the normal, human grieving that had been denied us for so
long. It amazes me that we were able to behave as sanely as we did.

The next morning Lucio Figueroa and Adela Ortiz awoke tangled together
at the back of the cave. They stared at one another first in horror and
confusion, then in deep embarrassment, then in resignation. He put his
arm around her, pulled one of the blankets we had salvaged around her,
and she leaned against him.

Jorge Cho and Diamond Scott awoke in a similar tangle, although they
seemed both unsurprised and unembarrassed.

Michael and Noriko awoke together and lay still against one another for
a long time, saying nothing, doing nothing. It seemed enough for each of
them that at last they could wake up in each other's arms.

The Mora girls awoke together, their faces still marked with the tears
they had shed the night before.

Somehow Aubrey Dovetree and Nina Noyer had found one another during the
night, although they had never paid much attention to one another
before. Once they were awake, they moved apart in obvious discomfort.

Only Allie awoke alone, huddled in fetal position in her blanket. I had
forgotten her. And hadn't she lost even more than the rest of us?

I put her between Harry and me, and we started a breakfast fire with the
wood we had left over from the night. We put together a breakfast of
odds and ends, and Harry and I made her eat. I borrowed a comb from
Diamond Scott, who had, in her neatness, managed to find one before we
left Camp Christian. With it I combed Allie's hair, then my own. Things
like that had begun to matter again, somehow. We all began to try to put
ourselves together as respectable human beings again. For so long we had
been filthy slaves in filthy rags cultivating filthy habits in the hope
of avoiding rape or lashing. I found myself longing for a deep tub of
hot, clean water. Thanks to our "teachers," filth and degradation had
become so ordinary that sometimes we forgot that we were in rags and
that we stank. In our exhaustion, fear, and pain, we came to treasure
those moments when we could just lie down and forget, when no one was
hurting us, when we had something to eat. Such animal comforts were all
we could afford. Remembering wasn't safe. You could lose your mind,
remembering.

My ancestors in this hemisphere were, by law, chattel slaves. In the
U.S., they were chattel slaves for two and a half centuries---at least
10 generations. I used to think I knew what that meant. Now I realize
that I can't begin to imagine the many terrible things that it must have
done to them. How did they survive it all and keep their humanity?
Certainly, they were never intended to keep it, just as we weren't.

"Today or tomorrow, we must separate," I said. "We must leave here in
small groups." Breakfast was over, and we had all made ourselves a
little more presentable. I could see that the others had begun to look
at one another, begun to wonder what to do next. I knew what we had to
do. I had known almost from the time we were collared that even if we
managed to free ourselves, we wouldn't be able to stay together.

"Earthseed continues," I said into the silence, "but Acorn is dead.
There are too many of us. We would be too easy to spot, too easy to
recapture or kill."

"What can we do?" Aubrey Dovetree demanded.

And Harry Balter said in a dead voice, "We've got to split up. We've got
to go our separate ways and find our kids."

"No," Nina Noyer whispered, and then louder, "No! Everybody's gone, and
now you want me to go away by myself again? No!" Now it was a shout.

"Yes," I said to her, only to her, my voice as soft as I could make it.
"Nina, you come with me. My family is gone too. Come with me. We'll look
for your sisters and my daughter and Allie's son."

"I want us all to stay together," she whispered, and she began to cry.

"If we stay together, we'll be collared or dead in no time," Harry said.
He looked at me. "I'll go with you too. You'll need help. And...I want
my kids back. I'm scared to death of what might be happening to them.
That's all I can think about now. That's all I care about."

And Allie put her hand on his shoulder, trying to give comfort.

"No one should leave alone," I said. It's too dangerous to be alone. But
don't gather into groups of more than five or six."

"What about us?" Doe Mora said, holding her sister's hand. It was hard
at that moment to remember that the two were not blood relatives. Two
lonely, frightened ex-slaves met and loved one another and married, and
their daughters Doe and Tori became sisters. And they're sisters now,
orphaned and alone. I envy their closeness, and I fear for them. They're
still kids, and they were abused almost past bearing at Camp Christian.
They look starved and haunted. In a way that I can't quite describe,
they look old. Our "teachers" realized that they were sharers back
during Day's rebellion, and abused them all the more for it, but the
girls never gave any of the rest of us away. Yet in spite of their
courage, it would be so easy for them to wind up with new collars around
their necks. Or they could wind up deciding to prostitute
themselves---just to eat.

"You come with us," Natividad said. "We intend to find our children. If
we can, we'll find your brothers as well."

Doe bit her lips. "I'm pregnant," she said. "Tori isn't, but I am."

"It's a wonder we all aren't," I said. "We were slaves. Now we're free."
I looked at her. She's a tall, slender, delicate-looking girl,
large-eyed like her namesake. "What do you want to do, Doe?"

Doe swallowed. "I don't know."

"We'll take care of her," Travis said. "Whatever she decides to do,
we'll help her. Her father was a good man. He was a friend of mine.
We'll take care of her."

I nodded, relieved. Travis and Natividad are two of the most competent,
dependable people I know. They'll survive, and if the girls are with
them, the girls will survive too.

Others began forming themselves into groups. Adela Ortiz, who first
thought that she would join Travis, Natividad, and the Moras, decided in
the end to stay with Lucio Figueroa and his sister. I'm not sure how she
and Lucio wound up in each other's arms the night before, but I think
now that Adela may be looking for a permanent relationship with Lucio.
He's much older than she is, and I think she hopes he'll want her and
want to take care of her. But Adela is pregnant too. She's not showing
yet, but according to what she's told me, she believes she's at least
two months pregnant.

Also, Lucio is still carrying Teresa Lin around with him. Her death and
the way she died has made him very, very quiet---kind, but distant. He
wasn't like that back in Acorn. His own wife and children were killed
before he met us. He had invested all his time and energy in helping his
sister with her children. He had only begun to reach out again when
Teresa joined us. Now...now perhaps he's decided that it hurts too much
to begin to care for someone, then lose her.

It does hurt. It's terrible. I know that. But I know Adela, too. She
needs to be needed. I remember she hated being pregnant the first time,
hated the men who had gang-raped her. But she loved taking care of her
baby. She was an attentive, loving mother, and she was happy. What's in
store for her now, I don't know.

And yet in spite of my fears for my friends, my people, in spite of my
longing to hold together a community that must divide, all this was
easier than I had thought it would be---easier than I thought it *could*
be. We'd all worked so well together for six years, and we'd endured so
much as slaves. Now we were dividing ourselves, deciding how to go our
separate ways. I don't mean that it was easy---just that it wasn't as
hard as I expected. God is Change. I've taught that for six years. It's
true, and I suppose it's paved the way for us now. Earthseed prepares
you to live in the world that is and try to shape the world that you
want. But none of it is really easy.

We spent the rest of the day going around to the other caches and
parceling out the supplies we'd left in them and gathering the other
sets of children's hand and foot prints. Then we had one more night
together. Once we had gone to all the caches---one had been raided, but
the rest were intact---we spent the night in another shallow cave. It
was raining again, and cold. That was good because it would make
tracking us pretty much impossible. On that last night, when we'd eaten,
we dropped off quickly to sleep. We'd been tramping through the
mountains all day, carrying packs that got heavier with each stop, and
we were tired. But the next morning before we parted, we held a final
Gathering. We sang Earthseed verses, to the tunes that Gray Mora and
Travis had written. We Remembered our dead, including our dead Acorn.
Each of us spoke of it, Remembering.

"You are Earthseed," I said to them, at last. "You always will be. I
love you. I love you all." I stopped for a moment, struggling to hold on
to what was left of my self-control.

Somehow, I went on. "Not everyone in this country stands with Andrew
Jarret," I said. "We know that. Jarret will pass, and we will still be
here. We know more about survival than most people. The proof is that we
have survived. We have tools that other people don't have, and that they
need. The time will come again when we can share what we know." I
paused, swallowed. "Stay well," I told them. "Take care of one another."

We agreed to visit the newly designated Humboldt Redwoods information
drop every month or two for a year---at least that long. We agreed that
it was best that each group not know yet where the other groups were
going---so that if one group was caught, it couldn't be forced to betray
the others. We agreed it was best not to live in the Eureka and Arcata
area because that's where most of our jailers lived, both the dead ones
and the off-shift ones who were still alive. Each city was home to a big
Christian American church and several affiliated organizations. We might
have to go to these cities to look for our children, but once we've
found them and taken them back, we should go elsewhere to live.

"And change your names," I told them. "As soon as you can, buy
yourselves new identities. Then relax. You're honest people. If anyone
says otherwise, attack their credibility. Accuse them of being secret
cultists, witches, Satanists, thieves. Whatever you think will endanger
your accusers the most, say it! Don't just defend yourselves. Attack.
And keep attacking until you scare the shit out of your accusers. Watch
them. Pay attention to their body language. Their own reactions will
tell you how best to damage them or scare them off.

"I don't think you'll have to do much of that kind of thing. The chances
of any of us running into someone who knew us at Camp Christian are
small. It's just that we need to be mentally prepared for it if it
happens. God is Change. Look after yourselves."

And we went our separate ways. Travis said we would be better off not
walking on the highway unless we could lose ourselves in a crowd. If
there were no crowds, he said, we should walk through the hills. It
would be harder, but safer. I agreed.

We hugged one another. It took a lot of hugging. It took the possibility
of coming together again someday in another state or another country or
a post-Jarret America. It took tears and fear and hope. It was terrible,
that final leavetaking. Deciding to do it was easier than I thought.
Doing it was much harder. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

Then I was alone with Allie, Harry, and Nina. We four slogged through
the mud, heading north. We traveled through the familiar hills, to the
outskirts of Eureka, and finally, to Georgetown. I was the one who
suggested Georgetown once we had separated from the others.

"Why?" Harry demanded in a cold voice that didn't sound much like Harry.

"Because it's a good place to pick up information," I said. "And because
I know Dolores Ramos George. She may not be able to help us, but she
won't talk about our being there."

Harry nodded.

"What's Georgetown?" Nina asked.

"A squatter settlement," I told her. "A big, nasty one. We went there
when we were looking for you and your sister. You can get lost in there.
People aren't nosy, and the Georges are all right."

"They're all right." Allie agreed. "They don't turn people in." These
were her first voluntary sentences since her lashing. I looked at her,
and she repeated, "They're all right. We can look for Justin from
Georgetown."

**The Destiny of Earthseed**

**Is to take root among the stars.**

**It is to live and to thrive**

**On new earths.**

**It is to become new beings**

**And to consider new questions.**

**It is to leap into the heavens**

**Again and again.**

**It is to explore the vastness**

**Of heaven.**

**It is to explore the vastness**

**Of ourselves.**

**M[Y FIRST CLEAR MEMORY]{.small} is of a doll. I was about three years
old, maybe four. I don't know where the doll came from. I still don't
know. I had never seen one before. I had never been told that they were
sinful or forbidden or even that they existed. I suspect now that this
doll had been thrown over our fence and abandoned. I found it at the
foot of the big pine tree that grew in our backyard.**

**The doll had been made in the image of an adolescent blond-haired
blue-eyed girl. I remember that it was very straight and thin. It was
dressed in a scrap of pink cloth. I remember feeling the knot in the
back of it where three ends of the scrap were tied over one shoulder and
around the waist. The knot was an oddly soft lump against the hard
plastic of the doll's body, and as soon as my fingers found it, I began
to pick at it. Then I chewed on it. Then I examined the coarse, yellow
hair. It looked like hair, but when I touched it, it didn't feel right.
And it bothered me that the legs didn't move. They just stuck out stiff,
the feet shaped in permanent tiptoes. I didn't know how to play with a
doll, but I knew how to look at it, feel it, taste it, file it away in
my memory as one of the new, strange things to come into my world.**

**Then Kayce was there, snatching the doll from me. When I reached for
it, wanting it back, she slapped me. She had come up behind me, seen
what was in my hands, and in her sudden rage, lost control. She was a
stern disciplinarian, but she rarely hit me. To give her her due, this
was the only time I remember her just lashing out at me that way in
anger. Maybe that's why I remember it so well.**

**A man who grew up at the Pelican Bay Christian American Children's
Home told me about a Matron who went into a similar rage and killed a
child.**

**Her victim was a seven-year-old boy who had Tourette's syndrome. My
informant said, "We kids didn't know anything about Tourette's syndrome,
but we knew this particular kid couldn't help yelling insults and making
noises. He didn't mean it. Some of us didn't like him. Some of us
thought he was crazy. But we all knew he didn't mean the things he
yelled out. We knew he couldn't help it. But Matron said he had a devil
in him, and she was always screaming at him---every day.**

**"Then one day she hit him, knocked him into the edge of a kitchen
cabinet. He hit the cabinet with his head, and he died.**

**"I don't believe Matron was sentenced and collared, but she was fired.
I just hope that she couldn't find another professional job and had to
indenture herself. One way or another, a person like her should wind up
wearing a collar."**

**There was a mindless rigidity about some Christian Americans---about
the ones who did the most harm. They were so certain that they were
right that, like medieval inquisitors, they would kill you, even torture
you to death, to save your soul. Kayce wasn't that bad, but she was more
rigid and literal-minded than any human being with normal intelligence
should have been, and I suffered for it.**

**Anyway, she snatched the doll from me and began slapping my face. All
the while, she was shouting at me. I was so scared, and screaming so
loud myself that I didn't know what she was saying. Looking back now, I
know it must have been something to do with idolatry, heathenism, or
graven images. Christian America had created whole new categories of sin
and expanded old ones. We were not permitted pictures of any kind.
Movies and television were forbidden, but somehow Dreamasks were
not---although only religious topics were permitted. Later, when I was
in school, older kids would pass around secular masks that offered
stories of adventure, war, and sex. I had my first pleasurable sexual
experience, wearing a deliberately mislabeled Dreamask. The label said
"The Story of Moses." In fact, it was the story of a girl who had wild
sex with her pastor, the deacons, and anyone else she could seduce. I
was eleven years old when I discovered that Mask. If Kayce had ever
known what it was, she might have done more than just slap my face. I
kept the dirty Mask well hidden.**

**But at three, I hadn't known enough to hide the doll. Only Kayce's
reaction told me what a terrible thing it was. She made me watch while
she dug a hole in our backyard, put the doll in, covered it with cooking
oil and old papers, and burned it. This, she said, was what would happen
to me if I went on defying God and working for Satan. I would go down to
hell, and what she had done to the doll, the devil would do to me. I
remember she made me look at the shapeless blackened plastic lump that
the doll had become. She made me hold it, and I cried because it was
still hot, and it burned my hand.**

**"If you think that hurts," she said, "you just wait until you get to
hell."**

**Years later, when I was a grown woman, the small daughter of a friend
showed me her doll. I managed to stand up quickly and get out of the
house. I didn't scream or thrust the doll away. I just ran. I panicked
at the sight of a little girl's doll---real panic. I had to think and
remember for a long time before I understood why.**

**The purpose of Christian America was to make America the great,
Christian country that it was supposed to be, to prepare it for a future
of strength, stability, and world leadership, and to prepare its people
for life everlasting in heaven. Yet sometimes now when I think about
Christian America and all that it did when it held power over so many
lives, I don't think about order and stability or greatness or even
places like Camp Christian or Pelican Bay. I think about the other
extremes, the many small, sad, silly extremes that made up so much of
Christian American life. I think about a little girl's doll and I try to
banish the shadows of panic that I still can't help feeling when I see
one.**

[WEDNESDAY, MARCH]{.small} 28, 2035

We have found Justin Gilchrist---or rather, he has found us. In the
weeks we've been at Georgetown, this is the best thing that's happened
to us.

We've been working for the Georges for room and board while we regained
our health, tried to find out where our children might be, caught up on
the news, and tried to find ways of fitting ourselves into the world as
it is now. Because we've worked for our keep, we still have most of the
money we arrived with. I've even managed to earn a little more by
reading and writing for people. Most people in Georgetown are
illiterate. I've begun to teach reading and writing to some of the few
who want to learn. That's also bringing in a little hard currency. And I
sell pencil sketches of people's children or other loved ones. This
last, I must be careful about. It seems that some of the more rabid
Christian America types have decided that a picture of your child might
be seen as a graven image. That seems too extreme to catch on with most
people even though Jarret is much loved in Georgetown. Many people here
have sons, brothers, husbands, or other male relatives who have been
injured or killed in the Al-Can War, but still, they love Jarret.

In fact, Jarret is both loved and despised here. The religious poor who
are ignorant, frightened, and desperate to improve their situations are
glad to see a "man of God" in the White House. And that's what he is to
them: a man of God.

Even some of the less religious ones support him. They say the country
needs a strong hand to bring back order, good jobs, honest cops, and
free schools. They say he has to be given plenty of time and a free hand
so he can put things right again.

But those dedicated to other religions, and those who are not religious
at all sneer at Jarret and call him a hypocrite. They sneer, they hate
him, but they also fear him. They see him for the tyrant that he is. And
the thugs see him as one of them. They envy him. He is the bigger, the
more successful thief, murderer, and slaver.

The working poor who love Jarret want to be fooled, need to be fooled.
They scratch a living, working long, hard hours at dangerous, dirty
jobs, and they need a savior. Poor women, in particular, tend to be
deeply religious and more than willing to see Jarret as the Second
Coming. Religion is all they have. Their employers and their men abuse
them. They bear more children than they can feed. They bear everyone's
contempt.

And yet, whether or not extreme Jarretites say it is a sin, they want
pictures of their little ones. And I charge less than local
photographers. I'm kinder than photographers too. I've never drawn a
child's dirt or its sores, or its rags. That isn't necessary. I've made
older plain boys handsome and plain girls pretty for their lovers or for
their parents. I've even managed after many tries to draw the dead,
guided by the loving memory of a relative or friend. I don't know how
accurate these drawings are, of course, but they please people.

I think I'll be able to earn a living sketching, teaching, reading, and
writing for people as long as I stick to squatter settlements and the
poor sections of towns. And there is a bonus to my becoming acquainted
with the people in these places. Many of the people in the squatter
settlements work in the yards and homes of somewhat-better-off people in
the towns and cities. The squatters do gardening, housecleaning,
painting, carpentry, childcare, even some plumbing and electrical work.
They serve people who have houses or apartments to live in but can't
afford to support even unsalaried live-in servants. Such people pay
small sums of money or provide food or clothing to get their work done.
Squatters who do this kind of work get a chance to see and hear any
number of useful things. If, for instance, new children have appeared at
an employer's home or at a home nearby, regular day laborers know of it.
And if the price is right, they'll tell what they know. Information is
as much for sale here as is anything else.

In spite of my efforts, though, we found Justin not by buying
information, but because he escaped from his new family and came looking
for us. He's 11 years old now---old enough to decide for himself what's
true and what isn't and too old to be told that the woman he's called
mother for eight of his 11 years was evil and worshiped the devil.

I had just finished a pen-and-ink sketch of a woman and her two youngest
kids, sitting outside their wood-and-plastic shack. I was headed back up
to my room at the hotel. The streets in Georgetown are all dirt tracks
or trash-filled ditches---open sewers---where you might step in
anything. The Georges were sensible enough to build their collection of
businesses upslope from the worst of the mess, but I can only do my work
by going down to where most of the people are. I haven't bought much
since I've been here, but I have invested in a pair of well-made,
water-resistant boots.

I was thinking, as I walked, about the woman whom I had just drawn with
her three-month-old and her 18-month-old. The mother isn't 30 yet, but
she looks fifty. She has nine kids, sparse, graying hair, and almost no
teeth. I felt as though I had gone back in time. Farther back, I mean.
We were nineteenth-century in Acorn. What is this, I wondered?
Eighteenth? And yet, perversely, I found myself filled with envy.

Sometimes I look at these poor, sad women and I'm almost sick with envy.
*At least they have their children.* If they have nothing else, they
have their children. I look at the children and I draw them, and I can
hardly stand it.

As I tramped up the hill toward my room at George's, I saw a little boy
squatting by the side of the path, his head in his hands. He was just
another scrawny little kid in rags. I thought he might be having a
nosebleed, and that made me want to hurry past him. My sharing makes me
a coward sometimes. But it also makes me resist being a coward.

I stopped. "Are you all right, honey?" I asked.

He jumped at the sound of my voice, then stared up at me. He was not
bleeding, but his lips were cut and swollen and he had an old slash in
his cheek and a big black-and-blue swelling on the left side of his
forehead. I froze the way I had learned to freeze when confronted with
unexpected pain, and the kid mumbled something that I didn't understand
because his mouth was so swollen. Then he just launched himself at me.

I thought at first that it was some kind of attack. I thought he might
have a knife or an old-style razor or even a skin patch of some poison
or a drug. There's nothing new about thieving or murderous children. In
a big squatter settlement like Georgetown, there were quite a few of
them, although they tended to go after the small, the weak, or the sick.
And they tended to travel in packs. Then somehow, before the boy touched
me, I knew him. I recognized his wounded, distorted face in spite of the
pain he was giving me.

Justin! Justin beaten and cut, but alive. I held him, ignoring the
people around us who stared or muttered. Justin is small and wiry. I
suspect he still has quite a bit of growing to do. He's White,
red-haired, and freckled. In short, he doesn't look like someone who
should be hugging me. But in Georgetown although people might stare,
they don't interfere. They mind their own business. They don't need
anyone else's trouble.

I held him away from me and looked him over. He was filthy and bloody,
and he didn't look as though he had had much to eat recently. The cuts
on his face and mouth and his bruised head weren't his only injuries. He
moved as though he hurt elsewhere.

"Is Mama here, too?" he asked.

"She's here," I said.

"Where?"

"I'm taking you to her." We had begun to walk together up toward the
George complex.

"Is the Doctor there too?"

I stopped, staring up toward the complex, and looked down, waiting until
I could keep my voice steady. "No, Jus. He's not here."

The Justin I had known back before Camp Christian would have accepted
these words at face value. He might have asked where Bankole was, but he
wouldn't have said what this much older, wounded, wiser child said.

"Shaper?"

I hadn't heard that title for a while. In fact, I hadn't heard my name
for a while. In Georgetown, I called myself Cory Duran. It was my
stepmother's maiden name, and I used it in the hope of attracting my
brother's attention if he happened to be around. The false name is
accepted here because even though I'd been to Georgetown several times
before the destruction of Acorn, among the permanent residents, only
Dolores George and her husband knew my name. And the Georges don't
gossip.

As for the title, in Acorn, all the children called me "Shaper." It was
the title that seemed right for one teaching Earthseed. Travis, too, was
called Shaper. So was Natividad.

"Shaper?"

"Yes, Jus."

"Is the Doctor dead?"

"Yes. He's dead."

"Oh." He had begun to cry. He had not been crying over his own injuries,
but he cried for my Bankole. I took his hand and we walked up the hill
to George's.

Like the rest of us, Allie has been working for Dolores George. I never
worried about my own ability to earn my way. I worried about Harry's
depression, but not about his resourcefulness. He would have little
trouble. Nina Noyer didn't give me time to worry about her. She arrived
at Georgetown and almost immediately fell in love with one of the
younger George sons. In spite of her two lost sisters, in spite of
Dolores George's disapproval, Nina and the boy are so intense, so
wrapped up in one another that Dolores knows she could only alienate her
son by objecting. She hopes the sudden passion will burn itself out. I'm
not so sure.

But I worried about Allie. She is healing. She talks now as much as she
ever did---which is to say, not a lot. She can think and reason. But not
all of her memory has come back. For that reason, I told Dolores some of
her story and hoped aloud that some permanent job could be found for
her. Dolores first gave her small jobs to do, cleaning floors, repairing
steps, painting railings....When she saw that Allie worked well and made
no trouble, she said Allie could stay as long as she wanted to. No
salary, just room and board.

I stopped at a tree stump about halfway up the hill and sat down and
took both of Justin's hands between mine. His face looked bad, and it
was hard to look at him, but I made myself do it. "Jus, they hurt your
mother."

He began to look afraid. "Hurt her how?"

"They put a collar on her. They put collars on all of us. They hurt her
with the collar. I don't know whether you've ever seen---"

"I have. I saw collar gangs working on the highway and in Eureka, fixing
potholes, pulling weeds, stuff like that. I saw how a collar can hurt
you and make you fall down and twitch and scream."

I nodded. "Collars can do more than that. Someone got really mad at your
mother and used the collar to hurt her badly. She's almost okay now, but
she's still having some trouble with her memory."

"Amnesia?"

"Yes. Most of what she's lost is what happened in the weeks and months
just before she was hurt. That was a bad time for us all, and it may be
a mercy that she's lost it. But don't be surprised if you ask her about
something and she doesn't remember. She can't help it."

He thought about that for a while, then asked in almost a whisper, "Will
she remember me?"

"Absolutely. We've been in contact with all sorts of people trying to
find out where you and the others were." Then I couldn't help myself. I
had to ask a few questions for myself. "Justin, were you with any of the
other kids? Were you with Larkin?"

He shook his head. "They took us all to Arcata to the church there. Then
they made us all separate. They said we were going to have new Christian
American families. They said...they said you were all dead. I believed
them at first, and I didn't know what to do. But then I saw how they
would lie whenever they felt like it. They would say things about us and
about Acorn that were nothing but lies. Then I didn't know what to
believe."

"Do you know where they sent Larkin---or any of the others?"

He shook his head again. "They made me go with some people who had a
girl and a boy of their own. I was almost the first one to go. I didn't
get to see who got the other kids. I guess they went with other
families. The people who got me, the man was a deacon. He said it was
his duty to take me. I guess it was his duty to beat me up, too!"

"Did he do this to your face?"

Justin nodded. "He did and his son---Carl. Carl said my mother was a
devil worshiper and a witch. He was always saying that. He's 12, and he
thinks he knows everything. Then a few days ago, he said she was a...a
whore. And I hit him. We got into a big fight and his father came out
and called me an ungrateful little devil-worshiping bastard. Then they
both beat the hell out of me. They locked up me in my room and I went
out the window. Then I didn't know where to go, so I just went south,
out of town, down toward Acorn. The deacon had said it wasn't there
anymore, but I had to see for myself. Then a woman saw me on the road
and she brought me here. She gave me some food and put some medicine on
my face. She had a lot of kids, but she let me stay with her for a
couple of days. I guess she would have let me live there. But I wanted
to go home."

I listened to all this, then sighed. "Acorn really is gone," I said.
"When we finally broke free, we burned what was left of it."

"*You* burned it?"

"Yes. We couldn't stay there. We would have been caught and collared
again or killed. So we took what we could carry, and we burned the rest.
Why should they be able to steal it and use it? We burned it!"

He drew back from me a little, and I was afraid I was scaring him. He's
a tough little kid, but he had been through a lot. I felt ashamed of
letting my feelings show more than I should have.

Then he came close and whispered, "Did you kill them?" So I hadn't been
scaring him. The look on his thin, battered face was intense and angry
and far more full of hate than a child's face should have been.

I just nodded.

"The ones who hurt my mother---did you kill them, too?"

"Yes."

"Good!"

We got up, and I took him to Allie. I watched them meet, saw Allie's
joyous tears, heard her cries. I could hardly stand it, but I watched.

Then Harry got an idea about where his kids might be. He had gotten a
job driving one of the George trucks or riding shotgun---something he
had had plenty of experience doing back at Acorn. He was even able to
make friends with the clannish George men. He would never be one of
them, but they liked him, and once he'd proved himself by spotting and
helping to prevent an attempted hijacking, they trusted him. This
enabled him to see more of the state than he could have by just
wandering on foot. But it also kept him on the job, with the trucks most
of the time. He couldn't look for his children himself---couldn't walk
through the little towns, looking at the children as they worked or
played. Doing that would probably get him into trouble, anyway.

Justin had given us two sad, useful bits of information. First, all the
kids' names were changed. Justin had been called Matthew Landis, just
another of Deacon Landis's sons. The older kids like Justin would
remember their real names and who their parents were, but the younger
ones, the babies, my Larkin....

The second bit of information was that sibling groups were always broken
up. This seemed an unnecessary bit of sadism, even for the Church of
Christian America. Justin didn't know why it was done, hadn't seen it
done, but he had heard Deacon Landis mention it to another man. So
children who had already lost their homes and their parents or guardians
had also had their sisters or brothers and their own names taken from
them.

With all that, how will I find Larkin?

How will I ever find my child? I've asked all the day laborers I know to
look for a Black girlchild, dark-skinned, not yet two years old, but
probably big for her age, who has suddenly appeared in a household where
there had been no pregnancy, in a household that might not be Black, or
in a foster home. I've pretended to be a day laborer myself and
substituted for two of the cleaning women so that I could look at two
children who had been reported to me as possible candidates. Neither was
anything like Larkin.

But is Larkin anything like the Larkin I remember anymore? How can she
be? Babies grow and change so fast. She was only two months old when
they took her. I'm afraid I won't know her now. But I still have the
hand and foot prints. I've made copies of them so that I can always
carry one. I've even gone to the police---the Humboldt County
Sheriff---with my false name and told them a false story of how my
daughter had been stolen from me as I walked along the highway. I left
them a copy of the hand and foot prints and paid the "fee for police
services" that you have to pay for anything other than an immediate
emergency. I don't know whether that was wise or useful, but I did it.
I'm doing everything I can think of.

That's why I don't blame Harry for what he's done. I wish like hell he
hadn't done it, but I don't blame him. When you're desperate, you do
desperate things.

Harry came to see me two days ago.

He'd just returned from a three-day trip up into Oregon and then over to
Tahoe and back. The usual thing for him to do after a trip like that
should have been to eat something and go to bed.

Instead, he came to my room to see me. I was working at a small, rickety
table I had bought. I had sketched a mother and her three children and
made the table the price of the sketch. My tiny, closetlike room itself
came with a window, a block of wood to wedge it open or bar it shut, a
narrow shelfbed, a lot of dirt, and a few bugs. I had bought a pitcher
and basin for quick washing, some soap, a chair and table for working,
and a jug with the best available water purifier for drinking water. And
bug spray.

"Fancy," Dolores had said when she came to look at it. "Why the hell
don't you spring for a decent room? You can afford it."

"When I find my daughter, maybe I'll be able to think about things like
that," I said. "I don't know what it will cost me to find her, then
maybe buy her. I don't know what I might have to do." And maybe, I did
not say, maybe I'll have to kidnap her and run. Maybe I'll have to pay
the Georges for a fast trip across one or two state lines. Maybe
anything. I couldn't waste money.

"Yeah," she said. "I haven't heard anything more, but my people are
listening."

They're still listening. So are the freelancers to whom I had paid a
little and promised a lot---people like Cougar, I'm sorry to
say---except that they deal in even younger children. I feel filthy
every time I have to talk to one of them. If anyone deserves to be
collared and put to work, they do, and yet there hasn't been any
particular Christian American crackdown on them.

Apparently we represent the greater danger to Jarret's America. What was
done to us was illegal, by the way. We've learned that much. No new laws
have been made to okay any of it. But, as Day Turner said long ago, a
lot of people are convinced that cracking down on the poor and the
different is a good idea. There are now a number of legal
cases---Hindus, Jews, Moslems, and others who have managed to avoid
being caught when Crusaders came for them. But even among these people,
young children who are taken away are not often returned. Charge after
charge of neglect and abuse is made against the parents or guardians. In
fact, the parents or guardians might wind up collared legally for the
horrible things they were supposed to have done to their children.
Sometimes brainwashed or terrorized children are produced to give
testimony against biological parents they haven't seen for months or
years. I wasn't sure what to make of that last. Justin had not turned
against Allie, no matter what he had been told about her. What kind of
brainwashing would make a child turn against its own parents?

So the legal road seems not to lead to a return of abducted
children---or it hasn't so far. It hasn't even led to an end of the
camps. Camps are mentioned on the nets and disks as being strictly for
the rehabilitation and reeducation of minor criminals---vagrants,
thieves, addicts, and prostitutes. That's all. No problem.

We are, as we have always been, on our own.

"I quit my job today," Harry said to me. He sat on my bed and leaned
forward on my table, looking across at me with disturbing intensity.
"I'm leaving."

I put aside the lessons I had been writing for one of my students---a
woman who wanted to learn to read so that she could teach her children.
My students can't or won't afford books of any kind. I write lessons for
them on sheets of paper that they buy from George's and bring to me.
I've taught them to practice first letters, then words on the ground in
a smooth patch of dirt. They write with their forefingers to learn to
feel the shapes of letters and words. Then I make them write with sharp,
slender sticks so they can get used to the feel of using a pencil or
pen.

It seems I've always taught. With four younger brothers, I feel as
though I were born teaching. I like doing it. I'm just not sure how much
good it does. How much good does anything do now?

"What have you heard?" I asked Harry.

He stared off to one side, out my window.

I reached across the table to take his hand. "Tell me, Harry."

He looked at me and tried, I think, to smile a little. "I've heard that
there's a big children's home run by Christian America down in Marin
County," he said, "and there's another in Ventura County. I don't have
addresses, but I'll find them. Truth is, I've heard there are a lot of
children's homes run by CA. But those are the only two I know of in
California." He paused, looked out the window again. "I don't know
whether they would send our kids to one of those places. Justin says he
didn't hear anything about children's homes or orphanages. He says all
he heard was that he and the other kids were going to new families to be
raised the right way as patriotic Christian Americans."

"But you're going down to Ventura and Marin to find out for sure?"

"I have to."

I thought about this, then shook my head. "I don't believe they'd send
kids as young as yours and mine down there. They have them adopted or
fostered around here somewhere. At worst they'd be here in small group
homes. The Ventura home would have kids pouring into it from all of
southern California. The Marin home would be full of kids from the Bay
Area and Sacramento."

"So you go on looking here," he said. "I want you to. If you find our
kids, it will be as good as if I found them. They won't be in the hands
of crazy people---of their own mother's murderers."

"*Here* is where it makes sense to look!" I said. "If CA is doing any
moving of kids, chances are, it's from south to north. It's still
crowded down there---with all the immigration from Latin America plus
the people from Arizona and Nevada and those who were already there."

"I've got to go," he said. "I know you're right, but it doesn't matter.
I don't know where to look up here. Adoptions, foster homes, even small
group homes don't call enough attention to themselves. We've been
checking them, one by one, and we could go on doing that for years. But
if the kids are down south, I might be able to get a job at first one,
then the other of the big homes and get a look at them."

I sat back, thinking. "I believe you're wrong," I said. "But if you
insist on going---"

"I'm going."

"You shouldn't go alone. You need someone to watch your back."

"I don't want you with me. I want you here, searching." He took two
palm-sized debit phones from his jacket pocket and pushed one toward me.
They were a cheap version of the prepaid renewable kind of satellite
phone that we used to use at Acorn. "I bought these yesterday," he said.
"I paid for five hours of in-country use. They're cheap, simple, and
anonymous. All you can do with them is call and receive, voice only. No
screen, no net access, no message storage. But at least we'll be able to
talk to one another."

"But your chances of surviving alone on the road---"

He got up and walked toward the door.

"Harry!" I said, standing myself.

"I'm tired," he said. "I've got to get some sleep. I'm half dead."

I let him go. His depression was bad enough. Depression and exhaustion
together were too much to fight against. He hadn't been himself since
Zahra's death. I would let him rest, then try to make him see reason. I
wouldn't try to make him stay, but going alone was suicide. He knew it.
Once he had rested, he would be able to admit it.

But the next day---today---Harry was gone.

He left George's early this morning, buying a ride in a truck headed for
Santa Barbara. I didn't know about it until I saw Dolores this morning.
She handed me the note that he had left with her for me.

"I have to go, Lauren," it said. "Keep the phone with you and stay put.
I'll come back. If I don't find the kids down south, I'll help you
continue the search up here. Don't worry, and take care of yourself."

All his life, he's been a funny, gentle, bright person with an
undercurrent of seriousness. We've known one another all our lives, and
felt comfortable enough together to be brother and sister. He and Zahra
were my best friends. I've lost count of the number of times we've saved
one another's lives.

And now it's over. Truly over. Zahra is dead. Harry is gone. Everyone is
gone. Allie meant to live in Georgetown with Justin. She had the one
thing she cared about: her son. And Nina Noyer just wanted to get
married and settle down with people who could take care of her and
protect her. I don't blame her, but I find I don't like her much. Her
little sisters might be wearing collars now or living with people who
abused and terrorized them in God's name. Or they might be in some huge
warehouse of a children's home, lost in the crowd, but separated from
one another if Justin was right---lost to everyone who had ever loved
them.

It isn't that Nina doesn't care. She just doesn't think she can do
anything to help them. "I'm not Dan," she's told me more than once.
"Maybe it means I'm weak, but I can't help it. I can't do what he did. I
can't! It's not fair to expect me to. He was a boy---almost a man! I
just want to get married and be happy!"

She's 16. Her brother was only 15 when he rescued her and brought her to
us. But as she says, she's not him.

From EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

**All prayers are to Self**

**And, in one way or another,**

**All prayers are answered.**

**Pray,**

**But beware.**

**Your desires,**

**Whether or not you achieve them**

**Will determine who you become.**

**I [WONDER WHAT MY]{.small} life would have been like if my mother had
found me. I don't doubt that she would have stolen me from the
Alexanders---or died trying. But then what? How long would it have been
before she put me aside for Earthseed, her other kid? Earthseed was
never long out of her thoughts. If it didn't comfort her during her
captivity---and I suspect it did---at least it sustained her. It enabled
her to survive without giving up or truly giving in to her captors. I
couldn't have helped her. I was her weakness. Earthseed was her
strength. No wonder it was her favorite.**

[FROM]{.small} *The Journals of Lauren Oya Olamina*

[SUNDAY, APRIL]{.small} 8, 2035

I'm on my own.

I've left Georgetown, left my students old and young, left my room
furnished with junk. I left some of my money and one of my guns with
Allie so that I'll have something to fall back on if I'm robbed. I've
come first to the message cache---two days' walk---to see whether
anything has been left. I'm there now. I'll sleep there in the shelter
of a living coast redwood tree that time and rot have hollowed out
enough to hold a human or three. I've found unsigned messages from
Travis and Natividad and from Michael and Noriko. Both identified
themselves by referring to incidents that any member of the community
would remember and understand but that would mean nothing to strangers.
I did the same in the message I left.

Neither couple had found their kids. Both had left numbers. They had
bought new phones---the cheap, talk-and-listen, debit phones like
Harry's and mine. I left three numbers---mine, Harry's, and one where
Allie could be reached. Then I wrote a message to those who might come
later.

"Justin is with us again! He's all right. There is hope. God is Change!"

God is Change. I wrote the words, then settled back to think about that.
I find that I haven't thought much about Earthseed in the past few
months. I believe its teachings helped me, helped all of us to survive
Camp Christian. God is Change. I've lost none of my belief. All that I
said to Bankole so long ago---two years ago---is still true.

So much has been destroyed, but it is still true. Earthseed is true. The
Destiny is as significant a human purpose as it ever was. Only Acorn is
gone. Acorn was precious, but it wasn't essential.

I sit here now, trying to think, to plan. I must find my daughter, and I
must teach Earthseed, make Earthseed real to as many people as I can
reach, and send them out to teach others.

The truth is, when I taught reading, I used a few simple Earthseed
verses. This is what I did in Acorn, and I did it automatically in
Georgetown. Strange to say, no one objected. People sometimes looked
puzzled, sometimes disagreed or agreed with enthusiasm, but no one
complained. Some people even seemed to think that what I read was from
the Bible. I couldn't bring myself to let them go on thinking that.

"No," I told them. "It's from something else called *Earthseed: The
Books of the Living.*" And I showed them one of the few surviving
copies---retrieved from one of the caches. Since I've been calling
myself Cory Duran, no one connected me with the strangely named author,
Lauren Oya Olamina.

Lines like the familiar,

*"All that you touch,*

*You Change...."*

And

*"To get along with God*

*Consider the consequences of your behavior."*

And

*"Belief*

*Initiates and guides action*

*Or it does nothing."*

And

*"Kindness eases Change."*

People seemed to like brief fragments of verses or complete rhythmic
verses because rhythmic verses are easy to memorize. And memorizing
verses made it easier to spot individual words and learn to recognize
them in their written forms. In that way, I guess I never stopped
teaching Earthseed. But without the Destiny, without a more complete
understanding of the belief system, what I taught was no more than a few
scattered verses and aphorisms. Nothing unifies them.

I must find at least a few people who are willing to learn more, and who
will be willing to teach what they've learned. I must build...not a
physical community this time. I guess I understand at last how easy it
is to destroy such a community. I need to create something wide-reaching
and harder to kill. That's why I must teach teachers. I must create not
only a dedicated little group of followers, not only a collection of
communities as I once imagined, but a movement. I must create a new
fashion in faith---a fashion that can evolve into a new religion, a new
guiding force, that can help humanity to put its great energy,
competitiveness, and creativity to work doing the truly vast job of
fulfilling the Destiny.

But first, somehow, I must find my child.

I am alone, and I know that's stupid. To travel alone is to make
yourself more vulnerable than you need to be. I wish I could have talked
Harry into working with me. He's endangering himself and wasting his
time down in southern California and around the Bay Area. I don't
believe there's any chance at all that our kids have been shipped down
there. They're here. And his kids and mine are so young that they've
surely been adopted. My Larkin could grow up believing that she is the
daughter of one her kidnappers. His kids were four and two when they
were taken, so I suspect the same could happen to them---if we let it.

Tomorrow, I'll start walking toward Eureka. I'm armed. I've got the old
.45 semiautomatic that made the trip up from Robledo with me. I had
tucked it into one of the caches, thinking I wouldn't need it again.
Also, I've done all that seemed reasonable to make myself look both poor
and male. I'm big and plain. That's good camouflage, at least. It's not
real protection, but it's the best I can do. If someone shoots me, I've
got no backup, so chances are, I'm dead. But I'm not the only solitary
walker out there, and maybe the robbers and the crazies will go for the
smaller ones who look like less trouble. And there are fewer robbers and
crazies. Or there were. At Georgetown and on my way here, I saw more and
more men in military uniforms---or parts of uniforms. They helped fight
Jarret's stupid Al-Can war. Now a lot of them are having a hard time
earning a living---and they're often very well armed.

There are more slavers now that Jarret's Crusaders have joined Cougar
and his friends in the game of collaring people and grabbing their kids.
I'm hoping to be invisible to them. I want to keep quiet, do my work,
and to look just crazy enough to encourage people to let me alone. As a
man, though, I must be very careful how I follow up the few leads I have
on small Black children who have appeared all of a sudden in families
where no one was pregnant. I don't want to be mistaken for a lurking
child molester or a kidnapper.

I hope to work for meals in Eureka and Arcata---a little yard work, some
painting, some minor carpentry, wood that needs chopping....If I stay
away from the wealthier neighborhoods, I should be all right. Wealthy
people wouldn't need to hire me anyway. They would keep a few
servants---people working for room and board. I would be working for
what was left of the middle class. I would be just one more day laborer
working for his next meal.

Down south and in the Bay Area, a laborer's life would be harder. People
are too distrustful of one another, too walled off from one another if
they can afford walls. But up here, men are hired, and then at least
decently fed. They might even be allowed to sleep in a shed, a garage,
or a barn. And they might---often do---get a look at the kids of the
family. They might---often do---hear talk that later proves useful. For
most laborers, useful means they might be steered toward other jobs or
away from trouble or let in on where people keep their valuables. For
me, useful might mean rumors of adoptions, fosterings, and children's
homes.

I'll wander around the Eureka-Arcata complex and the surrounding towns
for as long as I can. Allie has promised to go on collecting information
for me, and she says I can crash in her rooms at Georgetown when I need
a rest in a real bed. Also, if I'm picked up and collared, Dolores will
vouch for me---for a fee, of course. She knows what I'm doing. She
doesn't think I've got a chance in hell of succeeding, but she's got
kids and grandkids, so she knows I have to do this.

"I'd do the same thing myself," she said when I talked to her. "I'd do
all I could. Goddamn these so-called religious people. Thieves and
murderers---that's all they are. They should wear the collar. They
should roast in hell!"

There are times when I wish I believed in hell---other than the hells we
make for one another, I mean.

[SUNDAY, APRIL]{.small} 15, 2035

I've spent my first week doing other people's scutwork. Odd how familiar
all the jobs are---helping to plant vegetable or flower gardens,
chopping weeds, pruning bushes and small trees, cleaning up a winter's
accumulation of trash, repairing fences, and so on. These are all things
I did at Acorn where everyone did everything. People seem pleased and a
little surprised that I do good work. I've even earned some money by
suggesting extra jobs that I was willing to take care of for a fee.
People warn their kids away from me most of the time, but I do get to
see the kids, from babies in their mothers' arms to toddlers to older
kids and neighbor kids. I haven't seen any familiar faces yet, but, of
course, I've just begun. I've gone to as many Black or mixed-race
families as I could. I don't know what kind of people I should be
checking, but it seemed best to begin with these people. If they seem at
all friendly, I ask them if they have friends who might hire me. That's
gotten me a couple of jobs so far.

My problem has turned out to be having a place to sleep. A guy offered
to let me sleep in his garage that first night if I'd give him a blow
job.

I wasn't sure whether he thought I was a man or had spotted that I was a
woman, and I didn't care. I bedded down that night in a shabby park
where a few redwood trees survive. There, among a small flock of other
homeless people, I slept safely and awoke early to avoid the police.
People in Georgetown have warned me that collaring vagrants is what cops
do when they need some arrests to justify their paychecks. It's also
what some of the meaner ones do when they've had no amusement for a
while.

It was cold, but I've got warm, lightweight clothing and a comfortable,
shabby old sleepsack that I'd used on the trip up from Robledo. I woke
up aching a little from the uneven ground, but otherwise all right. I
needed a bath, but compared to the amount of crud I used to accumulate
back in Camp Christian, I was almost presentable. I had already decided
that I'd wash when I could, sleep sheltered when I could. I can't afford
to let myself worry about things like that.

On Tuesday, I was allowed to sleep in a toolshed, which was a good
thing, because it rained hard.

On Wednesday I was back in the park, although the woman I worked for
told me that I should go to the shelter at the Christian America Center
on Fourth Street.

Hell of a thought. I've known for weeks that the place existed, and I've
kept well clear of it. Laborers at Georgetown say they avoid the place.
People have been known to vanish from there. I'm afraid I'll have to go
there someday, though. I need to hear more about what the CA people do
with orphans. Problem is, I don't know how I'll be able to stand it. I
hate those bastards so much. There are moments when I'd kill them all if
I could. *I hate them.*

And I'm terrified of them. What if someone recognizes me? That's
unlikely, but what if? I can't go to the CA Center yet. I'll make myself
do it soon, but not yet. I'd rather blow my own brains out than wear a
collar again.

On Thursday, I was in the park, but on Friday and Saturday, I slept in
the garage of an old woman who wanted her fence repaired and painted and
her windowsills sanded and painted. Her neighbor kept coming over "to
chat." I understood that the neighbor was just making sure that I wasn't
murdering her friend, and I didn't mind. It turned out well in the end.
The neighbor wound up hiring me herself to chop weeds, prepare the soil,
and put in her vegetable and flower gardens. That was good because she
was my reason for going to her part of town. She was a blond woman with
a blond husband, and yet I had heard through my contacts at Georgetown
that she had two beautiful dark-haired, dark-skinned toddlers.

The woman turned out to be not well off at all, and yet she paid me a
few dollars in addition to a couple of good meals for the work I did. I
liked her, and I was glad when I saw that the two children she had
adopted were strangers. I write now in her garage, where there is an
electric light and a cot. It's cold, of course, but I'm wrapped up and
warm enough except for my hands. I need to write now more than ever
because I have no one to talk to, but writing is cold work on nights
like this.

[SUNDAY, MAY]{.small} 13, 2035

I've been to the Christian America Center. I've finally made myself go
there. It was like making myself step into a big nest of rattlesnakes,
but I've done it. I couldn't sleep there. Even without Day Turner's
experience to guide me, I couldn't have slept in the rattler's nest. But
I've eaten there three times now, trying to hear what there might be to
hear. I remember Day Turner telling me that he had been offered a bed,
meals, and a few dollars if he helped paint and repair a couple of
houses that were to be part of a CA home for orphaned children. He had
not known the addresses of the houses. Nor had he known Eureka well
enough to give me an idea where these houses might be, and that was a
shame. Our children might not still be there---if they were ever there.
But I might be able to learn something from the place. There might be
records that I could steal or rumors, memories, stories that I could
hear about. And if several of our children had been sent there, then
perhaps I could find one or two of them still there.

That last thought scared me a little. If I did find a couple of our
kids, I couldn't leave them in CA hands. One way or another, I would
have to free them and try to reunite them with their families. That
would draw such attention to me that I would have to leave the area,
and, I suspect, leave my Larkin. This is assuming that I would be able
to leave, that I didn't wind up wearing another collar.

The food at the CA Center was edible---a couple of slices of bread and a
rich stew of potatoes and vegetables flavored with beef, although I
never found meat of any kind in it. People around me complained about
the lack of meat, but I didn't mind. Over the past several months, I've
learned to eat whatever was put in front of me, and be glad of it. If I
could keep it down, and there was enough of it to fill my stomach, I
considered myself lucky. But it amazed me that I could keep anything
down while sitting so close to my enemies at the CA Center.

My first visit was the worst. My memory of it isn't as clear as it ought
to be. I know I went there. I sat and I ate with several dozen other
homeless men. I managed not to go crazy when someone began to preach at
us. I know I did all that, and I know that afterward, I needed the long,
long walk to the park to get my head back into working order. Walking,
like writing, helps.

I did it all in blind terror. How I looked to others I don't know. I
think I must have seemed too mentally sick even to talk to. No one tried
to make conversation with me, although some of the men talked to one
another. I got in line and after that I moved automatically, did what
others did. Once I sat down with my food, I found myself crouching over
it, protecting it, gulping it like a hawk who's caught a pigeon. I used
to see people doing that at Camp Christian. You got so damned hungry
there sometimes, it made you a little crazy. This time, though, it
wasn't the food that I cared about. I wasn't that hungry. And if I'd
wanted to, I could have changed my clothing, gone in to a decent
restaurant, and bought a real meal. It's just that somehow, if I focused
on the food and filled my mind with it as well as my body, I could keep
myself still and not get up and run, screaming, out of that place.

I have never, in freedom, been so afraid. People edged away from me. I
mean crazies, junkies, whores, and thieves edged away from me. I didn't
think about it at the time. I didn't think about anything. I'm surprised
that I manage to remember any of it now. I moved through it in a cloud
of blank terror and an absolute readiness to kill.

I had wrapped my gun in my spare clothes and put it at the bottom of my
pack. I did this on purpose so that there would be no quick way for me
to get at it. I didn't want to be tempted to get at it. If I needed it
inside the CA Center, I was already dead. I couldn't leave it anywhere,
but I could unload it. I took a lot of time earlier that evening,
unloading it and wrapping it up, watching myself wrap it up so that even
in the deepest panic I would know I couldn't get at it.

It worked. It was necessary, and it worked.

Years ago, when my neighborhood in Robledo burned, when so much of my
family burned, I had to go back. I got away in the night, and the next
day, I had to go back. I had to retrieve what I could of that part of my
life that was over, and I had to say goodbye. I had to. Up to that
moment, and long afterward, going back to my Robledo neighborhood was
the hardest thing I had ever done. This was worse.

When I went to the CA Center for the second time several days later, it
wasn't as bad. I could look and think and listen. I have no memory of
any word said during the first visit. I tried to listen, but I couldn't
take anything in. But during the second, I heard people talking about
the food, about employers who didn't pay, about women---I was in the
men's section---about places up north, out east, or down south were
there was work, about joints that hurt, about the war....I listened and
I looked. After a while, I saw myself. I saw a man crouching over his
food, spooning it into his mouth with intense and terrible
concentration. His eyes, when he looked up, looked around, were vacant
and scary. In line, he shambled more than he walked. If anyone got close
to him, he looked insanity and death at them. He was barely human.
People kept away from him. Maybe he was on something. He was big. He
might be dangerous. I kept away from him myself. But he was me a few
days before. I never found out what his particular problems were, but I
know they were as terrible to him as mine are to me.

I heard almost nothing about orphaned children or Jarret's Crusaders. A
couple of the men mentioned that they had kids. Most don't talk much,
but some can't stop talking: their long-lost homes, women, money, brave
deeds and suffering during the war....Nothing useful.

Still I went back for the third time last night. Same food. They throw
in different vegetables---whatever they happen to have, I suppose. The
only inevitable ingredient in the stew is potatoes, but dinner is always
vegetable stew and bread. And after the meal, there's always at least an
hour of sermon to bear. The doors are shut. You eat, then you listen.
Then you can leave or try to get a bed.

My first sermon I couldn't remember if my life depended on it. The
second was about Christ curing the sick and being willing to cure us too
if we only asked. The third was about Jesus Christ, the same yesterday,
today, and forever.

The lay minister who delivered this third sermon was Marc.

It was him, my brother, a lay minister in the Church of Christian
America.

In fear and surprise, I lowered my head, wondering whether he had seen
me. There were about two hundred other people in the men's cafeteria
that night---men of all races, ethnicities, and degrees of sanity. I sat
toward the back of the cafeteria, and off to the left of the podium or
pulpit or whatever it was. After a while I looked up without raising my
head. Nothing of Marc's body language indicated that he had seen me. As
he warmed to his sermon, though, he did mention that he had a sister who
was steeped in sin, a sister who had been raised in the way of the Lord,
but who had permitted herself to be pulled down by Satan. This sister
had, through the influence of Satan, done him a great injury, he said,
but he had forgiven her. He loved her. It hurt him that she would not
turn from sin. It hurt him that he had had to turn from her. He shed a
few tears and shook his head. At last he said, "Jesus Christ was your
Savior yesterday. He is your Savior today. He will be your Savior
forever. Your sister might desert you. Your brother might betray you.
Your friends might try to pull you down into sin. But Jesus will always
be there for you. So hold on to the Lord! Hold on! Stand firm in your
faith. Be courageous. Be strong. Be a soldier of Christ. He will help
you and protect you. He will raise you up and never, never, never let
you down!"

When it was over, I started to slip away with the crowd. I needed to
think. I had to figure out how to reach Marc outside the CA Center. At
the last minute, I went back and left a note for the lay minister with
one of the servers. It said, "Heard you preach tonight. Didn't know you
were here. Need to see you. Out front tomorrow evening where dinner line
forms up." And I signed it Bennett O.

One of our brothers was named Bennett Olamina. Olamina was an unusual
name. Someone in CA might notice it and remember it from records of the
inmates at Camp Christian. Also, it occurred to me that signing the name
I was using, "Cory Duran," might be cruel. Cory was Marc's mother, after
all, not mine. I didn't want to remind him of the pain of losing her or
hint that she might be alive. And if I had written Lauren O., I thought
Marc might decide not to come. We hadn't parted on the best of terms,
after all. Perhaps it's also cruel to hint to him that one of our two
youngest brothers might still be alive. Perhaps he'll know or guess that
I wrote the note. But I had to use a name that would get his attention.
I must see him. If he won't do anything else, surely he'll help me find
Larkin. He can't know what happened to us. I don't believe he would have
joined CA if he knew it was made up of thieves, kidnappers, slavers, and
murderers. He wanted to lead, to be important, to be respected, but he
had been a slave prostitute himself. No matter how angry he was at me,
he wouldn't wish me captivity and a collar. At least, I don't believe he
would.

The truth is, I don't know what to believe.

An old man is letting me sleep in his garage tonight. I chopped weeds
and cleared trash for him today. Now I'm content. I've spread some flat
boards over the concrete and covered the boards with rags. In my
sleepsack on top of these, I'm pretty comfortable. There's even a filthy
old flush toilet and a sink with running water out here---a real luxury.
I had a wash. Now I want to sleep, but all I can do, all I can think of
is Marc in *that place*, Marc with *those people.* Maybe he was even
there at the time of my first visit. We might have seen each other and
not known. What would he have done, I wonder, if he had recognized me?

[FROM]{.small} *Warrior by Marcos Duran*

[I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN]{.small} the power of God, distant and
profound. But more immediately, I believe in the power of religion
itself as a great mover of masses. I wonder if that's odd in the son of
a Baptist minister. I think my father honestly believed that faith in
God was enough. He lived as though he believed it. But it didn't save
him.

I began preaching when I was only a boy. I prayed for the sick and saw
some of them healed under my hands. I was given tithings of money and
food by people who had not enough to eat themselves. People who were old
enough to be my parents came to me for advice, reassurance, and comfort.
I was able to help them. I knew the Bible. I had my own version of my
father's quiet, caring, confident manner. I was only in my teens, but I
found people interesting. I liked them and I understood how to reach
them. I've always been a good mimic, and I'd had more education than
most of the people I dealt with. Some Sundays in my Robledo slum church,
I had as many as 200 people listening as I preached, taught, prayed, and
passed the plate.

But when the city authorities decided that we were no more than trash to
be swept out of our homes, my prayers had no power to stop them. The
city authorities were stronger and richer.

They had more and better guns. They had the power, the knowledge, and
the discipline to bury us.

The governments, city, county, state, and federal plus the big rich
companies were the sources of money, information, weapons---real
physical power. But in post-Pox America, successful churches were only
sources of influence. They offered people safe emotional catharsis, a
sense of community, and ways to organize their desires, hopes, and fears
into systems of ethics. Those things were important and necessary, but
they weren't power. If this country was ever to be restored to
greatness, it wasn't the little dollar-a-dozen preachers who would do
it.

Andrew Steele Jarret understood this. When he created Christian America
and then moved from the pulpit into politics, when he pulled religion
and government together and cemented the link with money from rich
businessmen, he created what should have been an unstoppable drive to
restore the country. And he became my teacher.

**I love my Uncle Marc. There were times when I was more than half in
love with him. He was so good-looking, and a beautiful person, male or
female, can get away with saying and doing things that would destroy a
plainer one. I never stopped loving him. Even my mother, I think, loved
him in spite of herself.**

**What Uncle Marc had been through as a slave marked him, I'm sure, but
I don't know how much. How can you know what a man would be like if he
had grown up unmarked by horror? What did my mother's time as a beaten,
robbed, raped slave do to her? She was always a woman of obsessive
purpose and great physical courage. She had always been willing to
sacrifice others to what she believed was right. She recognized that
last characteristic in Uncle Marc, but I don't believe she ever saw it
clearly in herself.**

[MONDAY, MAY]{.small} 14, 2035

I met with my brother earlier tonight.

I spent the day helping my latest employer---a likable old guy full of
stories of his adventures as a young man in the 1970s. He was a singer
and guitar player, with a band. They traveled the world, played raucous
music, and had wild sex with hundreds, maybe thousands, of eager young
girls. Lies, I suppose.

We put in a vegetable garden and pruned some of the dead limbs from his
fruit trees. I don't mean "we," of course. He said, "Well, how about we
do this?" Or, "Do you think we can do that?" And he tried to help, and
that was all right. He needed to feel useful, just as he needed someone
to hear his outrageous stories. He told me he was 88 years old. His two
sons are dead. His middle-aged granddaughter and his several young
great-grandchildren live in Edmonton, Alberta, up in Canada. He was
alone except for a neighbor lady who looked in now and then. And she was
74 herself.

He said I could stay as long as I wanted to if I would help him out in
the house and outside. The house wasn't in good shape. It had been
neglected for years. I couldn't have done all the repairs, of course,
even if he could have afforded the needed materials. But I decided to
stay for a few days to do what I could. I didn't dare stay long enough
for him to begin to depend on me, but a few days.

I thought that would give me a base to work from while I got to know my
brother again.

I'm trying to decide how to talk about my meeting with Marc. Tonight's
walk back to the old man's house has helped me to relax a little, calm
down a little. But not enough.

Marc was waiting near the long dinner line when I arrived. He looked so
handsome and at ease in his clean, stylish, casual clothing. He had worn
a dark blue suit when he preached the night before, and he had managed,
even as he told a couple of hundred thieves and winos how awful I was,
to look startlingly beautiful.

"Marc," I said.

He jumped, then turned to stare at me. He had glanced in my direction,
but it was obvious that he hadn't recognized me until I spoke to him. He
had been encouraging a man in line ahead of me to accept Jesus Christ as
his personal Savior and let Jesus help with his drinking problem. It
seemed that the CA Center had a rigorous drying-out program, and Marc
had been working hard to sell it.  

"Let's take a walk around the corner and talk," I said, and before he
could recover or answer, I turned and walked away, certain that he would
follow. He did. We were well away from the line and well away from any
listening ears when he caught up.

"Lauren!" he said. "My God, Lauren, is it you? What in hell are you---?"

I led him around the corner, out of sight of the line, and onto a dirty
little side street that led to the bay. I went on several steps down
that street, then stopped and turned and looked at him.

He stood frowning, staring at me, looking uncertain, surprised, almost
angry. There was no shame or defensiveness about him. That was good. His
reaction on seeing me would have been different, I'm sure, if he had
known what his Camp Christian friends had been doing to me.

"I need your help," I said. "I need you to help me to find my daughter."

This made nothing at all clear to him, but it did shift him away from
anger, which was what I wanted. "What?" he said.

"Your people have her. They took her. I don't...I don't believe that
they've killed her. I don't know what they've done with her, but I
suspect that one of them has adopted her. I need you to help me find
her."

"Lauren, what are you talking about? What are you doing here? Why are
you trying to look like a man? How did you find me?"

"I heard you preach last night."

And again he was reduced to saying, "What?" This time he looked a little
embarrassed, a little apprehensive.

"I've been coming here in the hope of finding out what CA does with the
children it takes."

"But these people don't take children! I mean, they rescue orphans from
the streets, but they don't---"

"And they 'rescue' the children of heathens, don't they? Well, they
'rescued' my daughter Larkin and all the rest of the younger children of
Acorn! They killed my Bankole! And Zahra! Zahra Moss Balter from
Robledo! They killed her! They put a collar around my neck and around
the necks of my people. CA did that! And then those holy Christians
worked us like slaves every day and used us like whores at night! That's
what they did. That's what kind of people they are. Now I need your help
to find my daughter!" All that came out in a rush, in a harsh, ugly
whisper, my face up close to his, my emotions almost out of control. I
hadn't meant to spit it all out at him that way. I needed him. I meant
to tell him everything, but not like that.

He stared at me as though I were speaking to him in Chinese. He put his
hand on my shoulder. "Lauren, come in. Have some food, a bath, a clean
bed. Come on in. We need to talk."

I stood still, not letting him move me. "Listen," I said in a more human
voice. "Listen, I know I'm dumping a lot on you, Marc, and I'm sorry." I
took a deep breath. "It's just that you're the only person I've felt
that I could dump it on. I need your help. I'm desperate."

"Come on in." He wasn't quite humoring me. He seemed to be in denial,
but not speaking of it. He was trying to divert me, tempt me with
meaningless comforts.

"Marc, if it's possible, I will never set foot in that poisonous place
again. Now that I've found you, I shouldn't have to."

"But these people will help you, Lauren. You're making some kind of
mistake. I don't understand it, but you are. We would rather take in
whole families than separate them. I've worked on the apartments that
we're renovating to help get people off the streets. I know---"

Now he was humoring me. "Have you ever heard of a place called Camp
Christian?" I asked, letting the harshness come back into my voice. He
was silent for a moment, but I knew before he spoke that the answer to
my question was *yes.*

"I wouldn't have named it that," he said. "It's a reeducation camp---one
of the places where the worst people we handle are sent. These are
people who would go to prison if we didn't take them. Minor criminals,
most of them---thieves, junkies, prostitutes, that kind of thing. We try
to reach them, teach them skills and self-discipline, stop them from
graduating to real prisons."

I listened, shaking my head. He was either a great actor or he believed
what he was saying. "Camp Christian *was* a prison," I said. "For
seventeen months it was a prison. Before that, it was Acorn. My people
and I built Acorn with our own hands, then your Christian America took
it, stole it from us, and turned it into a prison camp."

He just stood there, staring at me as though he didn't know what to
believe or what to do.

"Back in September," I said, keeping my voice low and even. "Back in
September of 33, they came with seven maggots, smashing through our
thorn fence, picking off our watchers. I knew we couldn't fight a force
like that. I signaled everyone to run like hell, scatter. You know we
had drills---drills for fighting and drills for fading into the hills.
None of it mattered. They gassed us. Three people might have gotten
away: the mute woman named May and the two little Noyer girls. I don't
know. They were the only ones we never heard anything about. The rest of
us were captured, collared, and used for work and for sex. Our younger
children were taken away. No one would tell us where. My Bankole, Zahra
Balter, Teresa Lin, and some others were killed. If we asked anything,
we were punished with the collars. If we were caught talking at all, we
were punished. We slept on the floor or on shelves in the school. Your
holy men took our houses. And they took us, too, when they felt like it.
Listen!"

He had stopped looking at me and begun to look past me, looking over my
right shoulder.

"They brought in street people and travelers and minor criminals and
other mountain families, and they collared them too," I said. "Marc! Do
you hear me?"

"I don't believe you," he said at last. "I don't believe any of this!"

"Go and look at what's left of Acorn. Look for yourself. Go to one of
the other so-called reeducation camps. I'll bet they're just as bad.
Check them out."

He began to shake his head. "This is not true! I know these people! They
wouldn't do what you're accusing them of."

"Maybe some of them wouldn't. But some of them did. All that we built
they stole."

"I don't believe you," he said. But he did believe. "You're making some
kind of mistake."

"Go and see for yourself," I repeated. "Be careful how you ask
questions. I don't want you to get into trouble. These are dangerous,
vicious people. Go and see."

He said nothing for a few seconds. It bothered me that he was frowning,
and again, not looking at me. "You were collared?" he asked at last.

"For seventeen months. Forever."

"How did you get away? Was your sentence up?"

"What? What sentence?"

"I mean did they let you go?"

"They never let anyone go. They killed quite a few of us, but they never
released anyone. I don't know what their long-range plans were for us,
if they had any, but I don't see how they could have dared to let us go
after what they'd done to us."

"How did you get free? You don't escape once someone's put a collar on
you. There's no escape from a collar."

Unless someone deals with the devil and buys your freedom, I thought.
But I didn't say it. "There was a landslide," I did say. "It smashed the
cabin where the control unit was kept---my cabin. The control unit
powered all the individual belt control units somehow. Maybe it even
powered the collars themselves. I'm not sure. Anyway, once it was
smashed and buried, the collars stopped working, and we went into our
homes and killed our surviving guards---those who hadn't been killed by
the landslide. Then we burned the cabins with their bodies inside. We
burned them. They were ours! We built every one with our own hands."

"You killed people...?"

"Their names were Cougar, Marc. Every one of them was named Cougar!"

He turned---wrenched himself around as though he had to uproot himself
to move---and started back toward the corner.

"Marc!"

He kept walking.

"Marc!" I grabbed his arm, pulled him back around to face me. "I didn't
tell you this to hurt you. I know I have hurt you, and I'm sorry but
these bastards have my child! I need your help to get her back. Please,
Marc."

He hit me.

I never expected it, never saw it coming. Even when we were kids, he and
I didn't hit each other.

I stumbled backward, more startled than hurt. And he was gone. By the
time I got to the corner, he had already vanished into the CA Center.

I was afraid to go in after him. In his present frame of mind, he might
turn me in. How will I get to see him again? Even if he decides to help
me, how will I contact him? Surely he will decide to help me once he's
had time to think. Surely he will.

[SUNDAY, JUNE]{.small} 3, 2035

I've left the Eureka-Arcata area.

I'm back at the message tree for the night. I brought a flashlight so
that I could have light where I wanted it without taking risks with
fire. Now, shielding my light, I'm reading what's been left here. Jorge
and Di have left a number, and Jorge says he's found his brother Mateo.
In fact, as with Justin, his brother found him. On the northern edge of
Garberville where there are still big redwoods, Mateo found Jorge's
group sleeping on the ground. He had been looking for them for months.
Like Justin, he had run away from abuse, although in his case, the abuse
was sexual. Now he's wounded and bitter, but he's with his brother
again.

There was no news from Harry. Too soon for him to have gotten back, I
suppose. I phoned him several times, but there was no answer. I'm
worried about him.

I wrote a note, warning the others to avoid the CA Center in Eureka. I
wrote that Marc had been there, but that he wasn't to be trusted.

He isn't to be trusted.

I made myself go back to the CA Center on Wednesday of last week---went
back as a sane, but shabby woman rather than as a dirty, crazy man. It
took me too long to get up the courage to do that---to go. I worried
that Marc might have warned his CA friends about me. I couldn't really
believe he would do that, but he might, and I'd had nightmares about
them grabbing me as soon as I showed up. I could feel them putting on
the collar. I'd wake up soaking wet and scared to death.

At last, I went to a used-clothing store and bought an old black skirt
and a blue blouse. From a cheap little shop, I bought some makeup and a
scarf for my hair. I dressed, made up, then dirtied up a little, like
maybe I'd been rolling around on the ground with someone.

At CA, I got in line with the other women and ate in the small,
walled-off women's section. No one seemed to pay any attention to me,
although my height was much more noticeable when I was among only women.
I slumped a little and kept my head down when I was standing. I tried to
look weary and bedraggled rather than furtive, but I discovered that
furtive wasn't all that unusual. Most of the women, like most of the
men, were stolid, indifferent, enduring. But a few were chattering
crazies, whiners, or frightened little rabbits. There was also a fat
woman with only one eye who prowled the room and tried to grab bread
from your hands even while you were eating it. She was crazy, of course,
but her particular craziness made her nasty and possibly dangerous. She
let me alone, but harassed several of the smaller women until a tiny,
feisty woman pulled a knife on her.

Then the servers called security, and security men came out of a back
room and grabbed both women from behind.

It bothered me very much that they took both women away. The fat crazy
woman had been permitted to go about her business until someone
resisted. Then both victim and victimizer were treated as equally
guilty.

It bothered me even more that the women were not thrown out. They were
taken away. Where? They didn't come back. No one I spoke to knew what
had happened to them.

Most troubling of all, I recognized one of the security men. He had been
at Acorn. He had been one of our "teachers" there. I had seen him take
Adela Ortiz away to rape her. I could shut my eyes and see him dragging
her off to the cabin he used. There had to be many such men still alive
and free---men who were not at Camp Christian when we took back our
freedom, then took our revenge. But this was the first one that I had
seen.

My fear and my hate returned full force and all but choked me. It took
all my self-control to sit still, eat my food, and go on being the lump
I had to seem to be. Day Turner had been collared after a fight that he
said he had had nothing to do with. Christian America officials made
themselves judges, juries, and, when they chose to be, executioners.
They didn't waste any effort trying to be fair. I had heard on one of my
earlier visits that the all-male CA Center Security Force was made up of
retired and off-duty cops. That, if it were true, was terrifying. It
made me all the more certain that I was right not to go to the police
with the true story of what had been done to me and to Acorn. Hell, I
hadn't even been able to get my own brother to believe me. What chance
would I have to convince the cops if some of them were working for CA?

After dinner, after the sermon, I managed to make myself go up to one of
the servers---a blond woman with a long red scar on her forehead. She
was one of the few who laughed and talked with us as she scooped stew
into bowls and passed out bread. I asked her to give my note to lay
minister Marcos Duran. As it happened, she knew him.

"He's not here anymore," she said. "He was transferred to Portland."

"Oregon?" I asked, and then felt stupid. Of course she meant Portland,
Oregon.

"Yeah," the server said. "He left a few days ago. He was offered a
chance to do more preaching at our new center in Portland, and he's
always wanted that. What a nice man. We were sorry to lose him. Did you
ever hear him preach?"

"A couple of times," I said. "Are you sure he's gone?"

"Yeah. We had a party for him. He'll be a great minister someday. A
great minister. He's so spiritual." She sighed.

Maybe "spiritual" is another word for fantastically good-looking in her
circles. Anyway, he was gone. Instead of helping me find Larkin or even
seeing me again, he had gone.

I thanked the server and headed out into the evening toward the home of
the 88-year-old man where I was still staying. I had left my spare
clothing and my sleepsack in his garage. For once, I was traveling
light. My backpack was half-empty. I walked automatically, not thinking
about where I was going. I was wondering whether I could reach Marc
again, wondering whether it would do me any good to reach him. What
would he do if I showed up in Portland? Run for Seattle? Why had he run,
anyway? I wouldn't have hurt him---wouldn't have said or done anything
that could damage his lay-minister reputation. Did he run because I
mentioned Cougar? Maybe it had been a mistake for me to tell him what
happened to us, to Acorn. Maybe I should have told him the same thing I
had told the police. "Well, I was walking north on U.S. 101, heading for
Eureka, and these guys...."

Was it so essential for him to be important in CA that he didn't care
what vicious things CA was doing, didn't care even what CA did to the
only family he had left?

Then there was a man looming in front of me---a huge man, tall and broad
and wearing a CA Center Security uniform. I stopped just before I would
have slammed into him. I jumped back. My impulse was to run like hell.
This guy looked scary enough to make anyone run. But the truth was, I
was frozen with fear. I couldn't move. I just stared up at him.

He put a huge hand inside his uniform jacket, and I had a flash of it
coming out holding a gun---not that this guy needed a gun to kill me. He
was a giant.

But his hand came out of his jacket holding an envelope---a little white
paper envelope like the kind mail used to come in. Back when we lived in
Robledo my father sometimes brought home paper mail from the college in
such envelopes.

"Reverend Duran said to give this to anyone tall and Black and asking
for him by name," the giant said. He had a soft, quiet voice that made
his appearance less threatening somehow. "Looks like you qualify," he
finished.

I had to make myself reach out and take the envelope.

The giant stared at me for a moment, then said, "He told me you were his
sister."

I nodded.

"He said you might be dressed as a man."

I didn't answer. I couldn't quite form words yet.

"He said he's sorry. He asked me to tell you that you could get a bed at
the Center for as long as you needed one. I'll be around. He's my
friend. I'll look out for you."

"No," I said, getting my voice to work at last. "But thank you." I stood
straight, never knowing when I had crouched in my fear. I extended a
hand, and the giant took it and shook it. "Thank you," I repeated, and
he was gone, striding back toward the Center.

I didn't stop to think. I tucked Marcus's envelope into my blouse and
walked on. You didn't stand opening things on dark streets in this part
of town. I kept my ears open now, and paid attention to my surroundings.
The giant had caught up with me, passed me, and gotten in front of me
and I hadn't heard a thing. That kind of inattention was beyond stupid.
It was suicidal.

And yet I had almost relaxed again by the time I was only three blocks
from the old man's little house. I was tired, full of food, looking
forward to my warm pallet, and eager to see what my brother had written.

Then, through my preoccupations, I began to hear footsteps. I swung
around just in time to startle and confront the two men who were
creeping up behind me. My gun was out of reach in my backpack, but my
knife was in my pocket. I grabbed it and flipped it open before these
guys could recover and clean the street with me. They weren't big, but
there were two of them. I put my back against someone's redwood fence,
and let them decide how much they wanted what they thought I had. In
fact I was carrying not only my gun but enough money to make them happy
for days, as well as Marcus's note, and I wasn't eager to give up any of
it.

"Just put the pack down, girl," one said. "Put the pack down and back
away from it. We'll let you go."

I didn't move. To take my pack off, I would have had to lower my knife
and trust these two not to jump me. That I didn't dare do. I didn't
answer them. I wasn't interested in talking to them. I hated hearing the
one call me "girl." It was what Bankole called me with love. And here
was the word in someone else's mouth with contempt.

I don't know whether or not I was being stupid. I know I was scared to
death and I was angry. I tried to stoke the anger.

I saw that one of them had a knife too. It was an old steak knife, but
it was a knife---made for cutting meat.

The one with the knife lunged at me. An instant later, the other lunged
too---one to cut, one to grab.

I dropped to the ground and stabbed upward into the belly of the
knife-wielder. As I jerked my knife free, not looking, not wanting to
see what I had done, I rammed my body backward against the legs of the
other man---or against where his legs should have been. I only hit one
of them---enough to trip him, but he seemed to recover without falling.
Then he did fall. He toppled like a tree as I scrambled to my feet.

They were both down, one curled around his belly wound, groaning, and
the other making no sound at all except his rasping breathing. The steak
knife stuck out of him just below the breastbone.

Shit.

I fell to my knees, my body a flaming mass of agony, from other people's
knife wounds. I twisted away from them both, crawled away from them on
all fours, dripping tears at the terrible, terrible pain. I dragged
myself around a corner and sat there on the broken concrete for a long
time. I was shaking with the pain, gasping with it until at last, it
began to ease. I got up before it was altogether gone. I went to the old
man's garage as quickly as I could. The pain was gone by the time I got
there, and the anger had long since gone. There was nothing left but the
fear. I got my things together as fast as I could, stuffed them into my
pack, and headed out of town. Maybe I didn't have to leave. Maybe the
tramp who had been living in the old man's garage would never be
connected with the two dead or soon-to-be dead men on the street nearby.
Maybe.

But I would not risk a collar.

So I ran.

So I run. I had to check the tree before I headed for Portland, and I'm
going to stop at Georgetown. Then I'll take an inland route and avoid
Eureka. Meanwhile, here are the words my brother left me:

"Lauren, I'm sorry I hit you---really sorry. I hope I didn't hurt you
too much. It's just that I couldn't stand to lose everything *again.* I
just couldn't. That keeps happening to me. Mom and Dad, the Durans, and
even Acorn, where I thought maybe I could stay. And I couldn't see how
anyone connected with Christian America could do what you say has been
done. I could barely stand to hear you say it. I knew it was just wrong.
It had to be.

"And I was right. The people who do the kind of thing you described are
a splinter group. Jarret has disclaimed all connection with them. They
call themselves Jarret's Crusaders, but they lie. They're extremists who
believe that reeducating heathen adults and placing their young children
in Christian American homes is the only way to restore order and
greatness. If Acorn was attacked, these are the likely attackers. I've
talked to my friends in CA, and they say it isn't safe to probe too
deeply into what the Crusaders are doing. The Crusaders are a kind of
secret society, absolutely dedicated, and ruthless. They're courageous
people. Misguided, but courageous. I've been told they really do find
good homes for the children they rescue. That's what they call
it---rescuing the children. They take them into their own homes if
necessary and raise them as their children or they find others to raise
them. Problem is, they're a nationwide group. They send the kids out of
their home areas---often out of their home states. They're serious about
raising these kids as good Christian Americans. They believe it would be
a sin against God and a crime against America to let them be reunited
with their heathen parents.

"I've heard all this second- or third-hand from at least half a dozen
people. I don't know how much of it is true. I don't know where Larkin
is, and don't have any idea how to find out. I'm sorry about that, sorry
about Bankole, sorry about everything.

"You probably won't like this, Lauren, but I think that if you really
want to find your daughter, you should join us---join Christian America.
Your cult has failed. Your god of change couldn't save you. Why not come
back to where you belong? If Mom and Dad were alive, they would join.
They would want you to be part of a good Christian organization that's
trying to put the country back together again. I know you're smart and
strong and too stubborn for your own good. If you can also be patient
and join us in our work, you'll have the only chance possible of getting
information about your daughter.

"I have to warn you, though, the movement won't let you preach. They
agree with Saint Paul in that: 'Let the woman learn in silence with all
subjection. But I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority
over the man but to be in silence.' But don't worry. There's plenty of
other more suitable work for women to do to serve the movement.

"Some of our people have relatives or friends who are Crusaders. Join
us, work hard, keep your eyes and ears open, and maybe you'll learn
things that will help you find your daughter---and help you into a good,
decent life as a Christian American woman.

"I don't know what else to tell you. I'm enclosing a few hundred in hard
currency. I wish I could give you more. I wish I could help you more. I
do wish you well, whatever you decide to do, and again, I'm sorry.
Marc."

And that was that. There wasn't a word about his going to Portland---no
explanation, no good-bye. No address. Had he, in fact, gone to Portland?
I thought about that and decided he had---or at least the server who
told me he had believed what she was saying.

But why did my brother not mention where he was going---or even *that*
he was going---in his letter? Did he think I wouldn't find out? Or was
he just signaling me in a cold, deliberate way that he wanted no further
contact with me. Was he saying, in effect, "You're my sister and I have
a duty to help you. So here's some advice and some money. Too bad about
your troubles, but I can't do any more. I've got to get on with my
life."

Well, the money I could use. As far as the advice was concerned, my
first impulse was to curse it, and to curse my brother for giving it.
Then, for a moment, I wondered whether I could join the enemy and find
my child. Perhaps I could.

Then I remembered the man I had seen at the Center---the one whom I had
last seen acting as one of our "teachers" at Acorn, and raping Adela
Ortiz. Perhaps he was the father of the child she would soon be having.
Marc might be able to convince himself that the Crusaders are outcast
extremists, but I know better. Whether CA chooses to admit it or not,
they and the Crusaders have members in common. How many? What are the
real connections? What does Jarret really think about the Crusaders?
Does he control them? If he doesn't like what they're doing, he should
make some effort to stop them. He shouldn't want them to make their
insanity part of his political image.

On the other hand, one way to make people afraid of you is to have a
crazy side---a side of yourself or your organization that's dangerous
and unpredictable---willing to do any damned thing.

Is that what's going on? I don't know and my brother doesn't want to
know.

From EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

**All religions are ultimately cargo cults. Adherents perform required

rewards. Earthseed offers its own rewards---room for small groups of
people to begin new lives and new ways of life with new opportunities,
new wealth, new concepts of wealth, new challenges to grow and to learn
and to decide what to become. Earthseed is the dawning adulthood of the
human species. It offers the only true immortality. It enables the seeds
of the Earth to become the seeds of new life, new communities on new
earths. The Destiny of Earthseed is to take root among the stars, and
there, again, to grow, to learn, and to fly.**

**I [BEGAN CREATING SECRET]{.small} Dreamask scenarios when I was 12. By
then, I was very much the timid, careful daughter of Kayce and Madison
Alexander. I knew that even though I was allowed to use Dreamasks with
strict Christian American scenarios---like the old "Asha Vere"
stories---no one would be likely to approve my creating new, uncensored
scenarios. I knew this because back when I was nine, I began making up
plain, linear installment stories to amuse myself and my few friends at
Christian America School. It was fun. My friends liked it until we all
got into trouble. Then some teacher eavesdropped, realized what I was
doing, and punished me for lying. My friends were punished for not
reporting my lies. We had to memorize whole chapters of Exodus, Psalms,
Proverbs, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel. Until we had memorized and been tested
on every single assigned chapter, we were allowed no free time---no
recess or lunch breaks. We were kept an hour late every day. We were
monitored even in the bathroom to make sure we weren't indulging in more
wickedness---like stealing a minute or two "from God."**

**It didn't matter that I had said from the beginning that my stories
were only made up. I never tried to convince anyone that they were true.
And it didn't matter that the Dreamask scenarios we were all allowed to
experience were equally imaginary. It was as though my teachers believed
that all the possible stories had already been created, and it was a sin
to make more---or at least it was a sin for me to make more.**

**But by the time I reached puberty, except for the pornography I
managed to find, most of the scenarios I was permitted were tired, dull,
boring things. Characters were always being shown the error of their
ways, suffering for their sins, and then returning to God. Boys fought
for Christian America. They went to war against heathens, or went out as
missionaries in dangerous, wicked, foreign jungles and deserts. Girls,
on the other hand, were always cooking, cleaning, sewing, crying,
praying, taking care of babies or old people, and going to church. Asha
Vere was unusual because she did interesting things. She saved people.
She *made* them return to God. She was one of the few. In fact as a
Black and a woman, she was the only one.**

**A very old woman---she was in her nineties and lived in one of the
nursing homes that Christian America had set up for elderly
members---once told me that Asha Vere was my generation's Nancy Drew. It
was years before I found out who Nancy Drew was.**

**Anyway, I wrote scenarios---had to write them down with a stylus in my
notebook since even outside of Christian America, no one was going to
trust a kid to work with a scenario recorder. At least our notebooks had
a lot of memory and I could code them to erase the scenarios if someone
else tried to get into them. Or I thought I could.**

**I wrote about having different parents---parents who cared about me
and didn't wish always that I were another person, the sainted Kamaria.
I didn't know at this time that I was adopted. All I had was the usual
child's suspicion that I might be, and that somewhere, somehow, I might
have beautiful, powerful "real" parents who would come for me someday.**

**I wrote about having four brothers and three sisters. The idea of
eight children appealed to me. I didn't think you could be lonely in
such a big family. My brothers and sisters and I had huge parties on
holidays and birthdays and we were always having adventures, and I had a
handsome boyfriend who was crazy about me, and the girls at school were
all jealous.**

**Instead of living in shabby, patched-together old Seattle with its
missile-strike scars, we lived in a big corporate town. We were
important and had plenty of money. We spent our time speeding around in
fast cars or making flashy scientific discoveries in laboratories or
catching gangs of spies, embezzlers, and saboteurs. Since this was a
Mask, I could live the adventures as any of my brothers or sisters or as
either of our parents. That meant I could "experience" being a boy or an
adult. But since it wasn't like a real Dreamask experience, I had no
sensation guidance beyond research and my imagination. I watched other
people, tried to make myself feel what it might be like to drive a car
or fire a gun or be an older brother who worked in the South Pacific as
a deep-sea miner or an older sister who was an architect in Antarctica
or a father who was CEO of a major corporation or a mother who was a
molecular biologist. The father was a big, godlike man who was rich and
smart and...not there most of the time. I had the hardest time being
him. Research didn't help much. He was more of a shell than the others.
What should a father be like inside, in his thoughts and feelings? I
wasn't sure. Not like Madison, for sure. Like the fathers of my
occasional friends? I saw my friends' fathers now and then, but I didn't
know them. Like the minister, maybe---stern and sure of himself and
usually surrounded by a lot of deferential men and smiling women, some
of whom were rumored to sleep with him even though they had husbands and
he had a wife. But how did he feel? What did he believe? What did he
want? What scared him?**

**I read a lot. I watched people and I eavesdropped. I got a lot of the
ideas from kids whose parents let them have nonreligious Masks and
books---bad books, we called them. In short, I tried to do what my
biological mother hated, but couldn't help doing. I tried to feel what
other people felt and know them---really know them.**

**It was all nonsense, of course. Harmless nonsense. But when I was
caught at it, it was suddenly all but criminal.**

**There was a theft in my Christian American History class. Someone
stole a small personal phone that the teacher had left on her desk. We
were all searched and our belongings collected and thoroughly examined.
Someone examined my notebook too thoroughly, in spite of my
self-destruct codes, and found my scenario.**

**I had to attend special religion classes for delinquents and get
counseling. I had to confess my sins before our local church. I had to
memorize a dozen or so more chapters of the Bible. While I was working
off my punishment, I began to hear whispers that I was, indeed, adopted,
and that I was the daughter not of rich, important, beautiful people but
of the worst heathen devils---murderers, thieves, and perverters of
God's word. The kids started it. There were plenty of kids around who
were known to be adopted, so it was commonplace to ridicule them and
make up lies about how evil their real parents were. And if you weren't
adopted, and someone got mad at you, they might call you a heathen
bastard whether you were or not.**

**So first the kids started in on me, then the adults, some of whom knew
that I was adopted, began to talk. "Well, after all, think about what
kind of woman her real mother must be. That's got to leave a mark on
her." Or, "You wait. That girl is no good. My grandmother used to say
the fruit doesn't fall far from the tree!" Or, "Well, what can you
expect? 'Vere' means truth, doesn't it? And the truth is, there's bad
blood in her if there ever was bad blood!"**

**I remember turning around in church to confront the nasty old woman
who had stage-whispered this last bit of stupidity to her equally
ancient friend. The two were sitting directly behind Kayce, Madison, and
me during Sunday evening service. I looked at her, and she just stared
back at me as though I were an animal who had somehow invaded the
church.**

**" 'God is love,' " I quoted to her in as sweet a voice as I could
manage. And then, " 'Love is the fulfilling of the law.' " I tried to
make sure that my words carried as well as her ugly stage whisper had
carried. Bad blood, for heaven's sake. Kayce had told me people said
things like that because they were ignorant, but that I had to respect
even the ignorant because they were older.**

**On that particular night, Kayce nudged me with a sharp elbow the
moment I spoke, and I saw the ignorant old woman's mouth turn down in a
grimace of dislike and disapproval.**

**I had just turned 13 when that happened. I remember after church,
Kayce and I had a huge fight because she said I was rude to an older
person, and I said I didn't care. I said I wanted to know whether I
really was adopted and if so, who were my real parents.**

**Kayce said she and Madison were the only parents I had to worry about,
and I was an ungrateful little heathen not to appreciate what I had.**

**That was that.**

**When I was 15, an enemy at school told me my real mother was not only
a heathen but a whore and a murderer. I hit her before I even thought
about it---and I discovered that I didn't know my own strength. I broke
her jaw. She was screaming and crying and bleeding, and I was
horrified---scared to death. I got kicked out of school, and very nearly
collared as a juvenile felon. Only Madison and our minister working
together managed to keep my neck out of a collar. This was the beginning
of the worst part of my adolescence. I was grateful to Madison. I hadn't
thought he would fight for me. I hadn't thought he would fight for
anything. He had become even more of a shadow as I had grown. He
repaired aging computers for poor working people. He had seemed closer
to his tools than he did to me, except when he was feeling me up.**

**Then, on Saturday, after my troubles had been papered over, while
Kayce was attending some women's-group thing at Church, Madison
explained to me how grateful I should be to him. He had saved me from a
collar. He read me an article about collars---how they hurt, how they
can "pacify" even the most violent criminal and still leave him able to
do useful work, how the holder of a collar control unit is "a virtual
puppet master" as far as the convict is concerned. And although the pain
that the collar can deliver is intense, it leaves no mark and does no
permanent harm no matter how often it must be used.**

**Madison gave me some other articles to read. As I took them, he
reached out with both sweaty little hands and felt my breasts.**

**"It wouldn't hurt you to show some gratitude," he said to me when I
pulled away. "I saved you from something really brutal. I don't know.
You're so ungrateful. Maybe I won't be able to save you next time." He
paused. "You know, your mama wanted to let you go on and be collared.
She thinks you hurt that girl on purpose." Another pause. "You need to
be nice to me, Asha. I'm all you've got."**

**He kept after me. There were times when I thought I should just sleep
with him and be done with it. But I was back in school by then and I
could stay away from home most of the time. He was such a godawful whiny
man. My only good luck was that he was small, and after a while, I
realized he was a little bit afraid of me. That was a shock. I had grown
up timid and afraid of almost everyone---resentful, but afraid. I had to
be provoked suddenly and severely to make me react with anything other
than argument. That's why I was so upset when I broke the girl's jaw.
Not only did I not know that I could hurt someone that badly, but I
wasn't the kind of person who hurt people at all.**

**But somehow, Madison didn't know that.**

**He wouldn't let me alone, but at least he didn't use physical force on
me. His moist little hands kept wandering and he kept pleading, and he
watched me. His eyes followed me so much, I was afraid Kayce would
notice and blame me. He tried to peek at me in the bathroom---I caught
him at it twice. He tried to watch me in my bedroom when I was
dressing.**

**At 15, I couldn't wait to get out of the house and away from both of
them for good.**

[THURSDAY, JUNE]{.small} 7, 2035

I'm back at Georgetown. I need to rest a little, check in with Allie,
clean up, pick up some of the things I left with her, and gather what
information I can. Then I'll head for Oregon. I need to get out of the
area for a while, and going up where Marc is seems a good choice. He
won't want to see me. He needs to be part of Christian America even
though he knows that Christian America's hands are far from clean. If he
doesn't want me around reminding him what kind of people he's mixed up
with, let him help me. Once I've got my child back, he'll never have to
see me again---unless he wants to.

It's hard to accept even the comforts of Georgetown now. It seems that I
can only stand myself when I'm moving, working, searching for Larkin.
I've got to get out of here.

Allie says I should stay until next week. She says I look like hell. I
suppose I did when I arrived. After all, I was pretending to be a
vagrant. I've cleaned up now and gone back to being an ordinary woman.
But even when I was clean, she said I looked older. "Too much older,"
she said.

"You've got your Justin back," I told her, and she looked away, looked
at Justin, who was playing basketball with some other Georgetown kids.
They had nailed an honest-to-goodness basket-without-a-bottom high up on
someone's cabin wall. Early Georgetown cabins were made of notched logs,
stone, and mud. They're heavy, sturdy things---so heavy that a few have
fallen in and killed people during earthquakes. But a nailed-on basket
and the blows of a newly stolen basketball did them no harm at all. One
of the men who had a job cleaning office buildings in Eureka had brought
the ball home the day before, saying he had found it in the street.

"How is Justin?" I asked Allie. She had set up a work area behind the
hotel. There she made or repaired furniture, repaired or sharpened
tools, and did reading and writing for people. She didn't teach reading
or writing as I had. She claimed she didn't have the patience for that
kind of teaching---although she was willing to show kids how to work
with wood, and she fixed their broken toys for free. She continued to do
repair work for the various George businesses, but no more cleaning, no
more fetching and carrying. Once Dolores George had seen the quality of
her work, Allie was allowed to do the things she loved for her living
and for Justin's. The repair work she was doing now for other people was
for extra cash to buy clothing or books for Justin.

"I wish you'd stay and teach him," she said to me. "I'm afraid he spends
too much time with kids who are already breaking into houses and robbing
people. If anything makes me leave Georgetown, it will be that."

I nodded, wondering what sort of things my Larkin was learning. And the
unwanted question occurred to me as it sometimes did: Was she still
alive to learn anything at all? I turned my back on Allie and stared out
into the vast, jumbled forest of shacks, cabins, tents, and lean-tos
that was Georgetown.

"Lauren?" Allie said in a voice too soft to trust.

I looked around at her, but she was hand-sanding the leg of a chair, and
not looking at me. I waited.

"You know...I had a son before Justin," she said.

"I know." Her father, who had prostituted her and her sister Jill had
also murdered her baby in a drunken rage. That was why she and Jill had
left home. They had waited until their father drank himself to sleep.
Then they set fire to their shack with him in it and ran away. Fire
again. What a cleansing friend. What a terrible enemy.

"I never even knew who my first son's father was," she said, "but I
loved him---my little boy. You can't know how I loved him. He came from
me, and he knew me, and he was mine." She sighed and looked up from the
chair leg. "For eight whole months, he was mine."

I stared at Georgetown again, knowing where she was going with this, not
really wanting to hear it. It had a nasty enough sound when I heard it
in my own head.

"I wanted to die when Daddy killed my baby. I wished he had killed me
too." She paused. "Jill kept me going---kind of like back at Camp
Christian, you kept me going." Another pause, longer this time.
"*Lauren, you might never find her*."

I didn't say anything, didn't move.

"She might be dead."

After a while, I turned to look at her. She was staring at me, looking
sad.

"I'm sorry," she said. "But it's true. And even if she's alive, you
might never find her."

"You knew about your baby," I said. "You knew he was dead, not suffering
somewhere, not being abused by crazy people who think they're
Christians. I don't know anything. But Justin is back, and now Jorge's
brother Mateo is back."

"I know, and you know that's different. Both boys are old enough to know
who they are. And...and they're old enough to survive abuse and
neglect."

I thought about that, understood it, turned away from it.

"You still have a life," she said.

"I can't give up on her."

"You can't now. But the time might come...."

I didn't say anything. After a while I spotted one of the men I had
gotten information from back before I began working in Eureka. I went
off to talk to him, see whether he'd heard anything. He hadn't.

[SUNDAY, JUNE]{.small} 10, 2035

It seems I'm to have a companion for my trip north. I don't know how I
feel about that. Allie sent her to me. She's a woman who should have
been rich and secure with her family down in Mendocino County, but,
according to her, her family didn't want her. They wanted her brother,
but they'd never wanted her. She was born from the body of a hired
surrogate back when that was still unusual, and although she looks much
like her mother and nothing like the surrogate, her parents never quite
accepted her---especially after her brother was born the old-fashioned
way from the body of his own mother. At 18, she was kidnapped for
ransom, but no ransom was ever paid. She knew her parents had the money,
but they never paid. Her brother was the prince, but somehow, she was
never the princess. Her captors had kept her for a while for sex. Then,
she got the idea to make herself seem sick. She would put her finger
down her throat whenever they weren't looking. Then she'd throw up all
over everything. At last, in disgust and fear, her captors abandoned her
down near Clear Lake. When she tried to go home, she discovered that
just before the Al-Can War began, her family left the area, moved to
Alaska. Now, more than a year after her kidnapping, she was on her way
to Alaska to find them. The fact that the war was not yet officially
over didn't faze her. She had nothing and no one except her family, and
she was going north. Allie had told her to go with me, at least as far
as Portland. "Watch one another's backs," she said when she brought us
together. "Maybe you'll both manage to live for a while longer."

Belen Ross, the girl's name was. She pronounced it Bay-LEN, and wanted
to be called Len. She looked at me---at my clean but cheap men's
clothing, my short hair, my boots.

"You don't need me," she said. She's tall, thin, pale, sharp-nosed, and
black-haired. She doesn't look strong, but she looks impressive,
somehow. In spite of all that's happened to her, she hasn't broken. She
still has a lot of pride.

"Know how to use a gun?" I asked.

She nodded. "I'm a damned good shot."

"Then let's talk."

The two of us went up to Allie's room and sat down together at the pine
table Allie had made for herself. It was simple and handsome. I ran a
hand over it. "Allie shouldn't be in a place like this," I said. "She's
good at what she does. She should have a shop of her own in some town."

"No one belongs in a place like this," Len said. "If children grow up
here, what chance do they have?"

"What chance do you have?" I asked her.

She looked away. "This is only about our traveling together to
Portland," she said.

I nodded. "Allie's right. We will have a better chance together. Lone
travelers make good targets."

"I've traveled alone before," she said.

"I have too. And I know that alone, you have to fight off attacks that
might not even happen at all if you aren't alone, and if you and your
companion are armed."

She sighed and nodded. "You're right. I suppose I don't really mind
traveling with you. It won't be for long."

I shook my head. "That's right. You won't have to put up with me for
long."

She frowned at me. "Well, what more do you want? We'll get to Portland,
and that will be that. We'll never see each other again."

"For now, though, I want to know that you're someone I can trust with my
life. I need to know who you are, and you need to know who I am."

"Allie told me you were from a walled community down south."

"In Robledo, yes."

"Wherever. Your community got wiped out, and you came up here to start
another community. It got wiped out and you wound up here." That sounded
like Allie, giving only the bare bones of my life.

"My husband was killed, my child kidnapped, and my community destroyed,"
I said. "I'm looking for my child---and for any children of my former
community. Only two have been found so far---two of the oldest. My
daughter was only a baby."

"Yeah." Len looked away. "Allie said you were looking for your daughter.
Too bad. Hope you find her."

Just as I was beginning to get angry with this woman, it occurred to me
that she was acting. And as soon as the thought came to me, it was
followed by others. Much of what she had shown me so far was false. She
had not lied with her words. It was her manner that was a lie---filled
with threads of wrongness. She was not the bored, indifferent person she
wanted to seem to be. She was just trying to keep her distance.
Strangers might be dangerous and cruel. Best to keep one's distance.

Problem was, even though this girl had been treated very badly, she
wasn't distant. It wasn't natural to her. It made her a little bit
uncomfortable all the time---like an itch, and in her body language, she
was communicating her discomfort to me. And, I decided, watching her,
there was something else wrong.

"Shall we travel together?" I asked. "I usually travel as a man, by the
way. I'm big enough and androgynous-looking enough to get away with it."

"Fine with me."

I looked at her, waiting.

She shrugged. "So we travel together. All right."

I went on looking at her.

She shifted in her hard chair. "What's the matter? What is it?"

I reached out and took her hand before she could flinch away. "I'm a
sharer," I said. "And so are you."

She snatched her hand away and glared at me. "For godsake! We're only
traveling together. Maybe not even that. Keep your accusations to
yourself!"

"That's the kind of secret that gets companion travelers killed. If
you're still alive, it's obvious that you can handle sudden, unexpected
pain. But believe me, two sharers traveling together need to know how to
help one another."

She got up and ran out of the room.

I looked after her, wondering whether she would come back. I didn't care
whether or not she did, but the strength of her reaction surprised me.
Back at Acorn, people were always surprised to be recognized as sharers
when they came to us. But once they were recognized, and no one hurt
them, they were all right. I never identified another sharer without
identifying myself. And most of the ones I did identify realized that
sharers do need to learn to manage without crippling one another. Male
sharers were touchy---resenting their extra vulnerability more than
females seemed to, but none of them, male or female, had just turned and
run away.

Well, Belen Ross had been rich, if not loved. She had been protected
from the world even better than I had been down in Robledo. She had
learned that the people within the walls of her father's compound were
of one kind, and those outside were of another. She had learned that she
had to protect herself from that other kind. One must never let them see
weakness. Perhaps that was it. If so, she wouldn't come back. She would
get her things and leave the area as soon as she could. She would not
stay where someone knew her dangerous secret.

All this happened on Friday. I didn't see Len again until
yesterday---Saturday. I met with a few of the men who had provided me
with useful information before---in particular with those who had been
to Portland. I bought them drinks and listened to what they had to say,
then I left them and bought maps of northern California and Oregon. I
bought dried fruit, beans, cornmeal, almonds, sunflower seeds, supplies
for my first aid kit, and ammunition for my rifle and my handgun. I
bought these things from the George's even though their prices are
higher than those of most stores in Eureka. I wouldn't be going to
Eureka again soon. I would go inland for a while toward Interstate 5. I
might even travel along I-5 if it seemed wise once I'd gotten there and
had a look at it. In some parts of California, I-5 has become
frightening and dangerous---or at least it was back in ʼ27 when I walked
it for a few miles. In any case, I-5 would take me right into Portland.
If I circled back to the coast and walked up U.S. 101, I'd have a longer
walk. And U.S. 101 looked lonelier. There were fewer towns, smaller
towns.

"Big towns are good," a man from Salem, Oregon, had told me. "You can be
anonymous. Small towns can be mean and suspicious when strangers show
up. If they just had a robbery or something, they might pull you in, put
a collar on you, or lock you up or even shoot you. Big cities are bad
news. They chew you up and spit you out in pieces. You're nobody, and if
you die in the gutter, nobody cares but the sanitation department. Maybe
not even them."

"You gotta think about there's still a war on," a man from Bakersfield,
California, had said. "It could flare back up anytime, no matter how
much they talk peace. Nobody knows what more war's going to mean to
people walking on the highway. More guns, I guess. More crazy guys, more
guys who don't know how to do anything but kill people."

He was probably right. He had, as he put it, "been bummin' around for
more than 20 years," and he was still around. That alone made his
opinion worth something. He told me he had had no trouble going back and
forth to Portland, even last year during the war, and that was good
news. There were fewer people on the road than there had been back in
the 2020s, but more than just before the war. I remember when I hoped
that fewer travelers were a sign that things were getting better. I
suppose things are getting better for some people.

Len came to me just as I finished my purchases at George's. Without a
word, she helped me carry my stuff back to Allie's room, where, in
continuing silence, she watched while I packed it. She couldn't really
help with that.

"Your pack ready?" I asked her.

She shook her head.

"Go get it ready."

She caught my arm and waited until she had my full attention. "First
tell me how you knew," she said. "I've never had anyone spot me like
that."

I drew a long breath. "You're what, 19?"

"Yes."

"And you've never spotted anyone?"

She shook her head again. "I had just about decided that there weren't
any others. I thought the ones who let themselves be discovered were
collared or killed. I've been terrified that someone would notice. And
then you did. I almost left without you."

"I thought you might, but there didn't seem to be anything I could say
to you that wouldn't upset you even more."

"And you really are....You really...have it too?"

"I'm a sharer, yes." I stared past her for a moment. "One of the best
days of my life was when I realized that my daughter probably wasn't.
You can't be 100 percent sure with babies, but I don't believe that she
was. And I had a friend who had four sharer kids. He said he didn't
think she was either." And where were Gray Mora's children now? What was
happening to the lost little boys? Could there be anyone more vulnerable
than little male sharers at the mercy of both men and other boys?

"Four sharer children?" Len demanded. "Four?"

I nodded.

"I think...I think my life would have been so different if my brother
had been a sharer, too, instead of his normal, perfect self," Len said.
"It was as though I had leprosy and he didn't. You know what I mean?
There was an idea once that people who had leprosy were unclean and God
didn't much like them."

I nodded. "Who was the Paracetco addict in your family?"

"They both were---both of my parents."

"Oh, my. And you were the evidence of their misbehavior, the constant
reminder. I suppose they couldn't forgive you for that."

She thought about that for a while. "You're right. People do blame you
for the things they do to you. The men who kidnapped me blamed me
because they had gone to so much trouble to get me, then there was no
ransom. I don't remember how many times they hit me for that---as though
it were all my fault."

"These days, projecting blame is almost an art form."

"You still haven't told me how you knew."

"Your body language. Everything about you. If you have a chance to meet
others, you'll begin to recognize them. It just takes practice."

"Some people think sharing is a power---like some kind of extrasensory
perception."

I shrugged. "You and I know it isn't."

She began to look a little happier. "When do we leave?"

"Monday morning just before dawn. Don't say anything about it to
anyone."

"Of course not!"

"Are you all right for supplies?"

In a different tone, she repeated, "Of course not. But I'll be all
right. I can take care of myself."

"We'll be traveling together for almost a month," I said. "The idea is
that we should take care of ourselves and of one another. What do you
need?"

We sat together quiet for a while, and she wrestled in silence with her
pride and her temper.

"It's sometimes best to avoid towns," I said. "Some towns fear and hate
travelers. If they don't arrest them or beat them, they chase them away.
Sometimes at the end of the day, there are no towns within reach. And
fasting and hiking don't go well together. Now let's go get you some
supplies. I assume you stole the things you have now."

"Thank you," she said, "for assuming that."

I laughed and heard bitterness in my own laughter. "We do what we have
to do to live. But don't steal while you're with me." I let my voice
harden a little. "And don't steal from me."

"You'll take my word that I won't?"

"Will you give me your word?"

She looked down her long, thin nose at me. "You enjoy telling people
what to do, don't you?"

I shrugged. "I like living, and I like being free. And you and I need to
be able to trust one another." I watched her now, needing to see all
that there was to be seen.

"I know," she said. "It's just that...I've always had things. I used to
give clothing, shoes, food, things like that to the families of our
servants at Christmas. About five years ago, my mother stopped seeing
anyone except members of the family, and my father got into the habit of
leaving the house servants to me. Now I'm poorer than our servants were.
*And, yes, everything I have, I've stolen.* I was so idealistic when I
was at home. I wouldn't steal anything. Now I feel moral because I'm a
thief instead of a prostitute."

"While we're together, you won't be either."

"...all right."

And I let myself relax a little. She seemed to mean it. "Let's go get
what you need, then. Come on."

[WEDNESDAY, JUNE]{.small} 13, 2035

We're on our way and we've had no trouble. Len asked me whether I had
anything to read when we stopped last night, and I handed her one of my
two remaining copies of *The First Book of the Living.* We're not
rushing and the days are long, so we don't have to push on until it's
too dark to read.

We've traveled south to a state highway that will take us inland to I-5.
Len gave no trouble about this. She did ask, "Why not walk right up the
coast?"

"I want to avoid Eureka," I told her. "I was mugged last time I was
there."

She made a grim face, then nodded. "God, I hope we can avoid that kind
of thing."

"The best way to avoid it is to be ready for it," I said. "Accept the
reality that it might happen, and keep your eyes and ears open."

"I know."

She's a good traveler. She complains, but she's willing to keep her
share of the watches. One of the scary things about being alone is
having no one to watch while you sleep. You have to sleep on your
belongings, using them as a pillow or at least keeping them in your
sleepsack with you, or someone will make off with them. The violent
thieves are the ones who present the most obvious and immediate danger,
but sneak thieves can hurt you. For one thing, they can force you to
join them. If they steal your money or if you don't have enough money to
replace the essentials they've stolen, then you have to steal to
survive. My experience with collars has made me a very reluctant
thief---not that I was ever an eager one.

Anyway, Len is a good traveling companion. And she's an avid reader with
an active mind. She says one of the things she misses most about home is
computer access to the libraries of the world. She's well read. She
rushed through *Earthseed: The First Book of the Living* in one evening.
Problem is, it wasn't intended to be rushed through.

"I know you wrote this book," she said when she'd finished it---a couple
of hours ago. "Allie told me you wrote a book about something called
Earthseed. Is this your real name? Lauren Oya Olamina?"

I nodded. It didn't matter that she knew. We've bedded down off the
road, between of a pair of hills where we can have some privacy. We're
still in country that I know---hills, scattered ranches, small
communities, stands of young trees, open ground. Nice country. We walked
through it many times from Acorn. It's less populated than it should be
because during the worst years of the 2020s, a lot of people were burned
out, robbed, abducted, or just killed. The small communities were
vulnerable and the gangs swept over them like locusts. Many of the
survivors looked for less crime-ridden places to live---places like
Canada, Alaska, and Russia. That's why so much was abandoned to the
likes of us when we hunted building materials, useful plants, and old
tools. Now, though, the land's familiarity doesn't comfort me. Then Len
asks me a familiar question, and that is comforting, somehow.

"Why did you write this?"

"Because it's true," I answered, and from then until the time she lay
down to sleep, we talked about Earthseed and what it meant, what it
could mean and how anyone could ever accept it even if they happened to
hear about it. She doesn't sneer, but she doesn't understand yet either.
I find that I look forward to teaching her.

[SUNDAY, JUNE]{.small} 17, 2035

We're taking the day off. We're in Redding---a little west of Redding in
a park, really. Redding is a sizable city. We've made camp, for once in
a place where people are supposed to camp, and we're eating heavy, tasty
food bought in town. We've also had a chance to bathe and do our
laundry. It always puts me in a better mood not to stink and not to have
to endure the body odor of my companion. Somehow, no matter how awful I
smell, I can still smell other people.

We've had a hot stew of potatoes, vegetables, and jerked beef with a
topping of lovely Cheddar cheese. It turns out that Len can't cook. She
says her mother could but never did. Never had to. Servants did the
cooking, the cleaning, repairing things. Teachers were hired for Len and
her brother---mostly to guide their use of the computer courses and to
be sure they did the work they were supposed to do. Their father, their
computer connections, and their older servants provided them with most
of what they knew about the world. Ordinary living skills like cooking
and sewing were never on the agenda.

"What did your mother do?" I asked.

Len shrugged. "Nothing, really. She lived in her virtual room---her own
private fantasy universe. That room could take her anywhere, so why
should she ever come out? She was getting fat and losing her physical
and mental health, but her v-room was all she cared about."

I frowned. "I've heard of that kind of thing---people being hooked on
Dreamasks or on virtual-world fantasies. I don't know anything about it,
though."

"What is there to know? Dreamasks are nothing---cheap kid's toys. Really
limited. In that room she could go anywhere, be anyone, be with anyone.
It was like a womb with an imagination. She could visit
fourteenth-century China, present-day Argentina, Greenland in any
imagined distant future, or one of the distant worlds circling Alpha
Centauri. You name it, she could create some version of it. Or she could
visit her friends, real and imaginary. Her real friends were other
wealthy, idle people---mostly women and children. They were as addicted
to their v-rooms as she was to hers. If her real friends didn't indulge
her as much as she wanted them to, she just created more obliging
versions of them. By the time I was abducted, I didn't know whether she
really had contact with any flesh-and-blood people anymore. She couldn't
stand real people with real egos of their own."

I thought about this. It was worse than anything I had heard about this
particular addiction. "What about food?" I asked. "What about bathing or
just going to the bathroom?"

"She used to come out for meals. She had her own bathroom. All by
itself, it was big as my bedroom. Then she began to have all her meals
sent in. After that, there were whole months when I didn't see her. Even
when I took her meals in myself, I had to just leave them. She was in
the v-bubble inside the room, and I couldn't even see her. If I went
into the bubble---you could just walk into it---she would scream at me.
I wasn't part of her perfect fantasy life. My brother, on the other
hand, was. He got to visit her once or twice a week and share in her
fantasies. Nice, isn't it."

I sighed. "Didn't your father mind any of this? Didn't he try to help
her---or you?"

"He was busy making money and screwing the maids and their
children---some of whom were also his children. He wasn't cut off from
the outside, but he had his own fantasy life." She hesitated. "Do I seem
normal to you?"

I couldn't help seeing where she was going with that. "We're survivors,
Len. You are. I am. Most of Georgetown is. All of Acorn was. We've been
slammed around in all kinds of ways. We're all wounded. We're healing as
best we can. And, no, we're not normal. Normal people wouldn't have
survived what we've survived. If we were normal we'd be dead."

That made her cry. I just held her. No doubt she had been repressing far
too much in recent years. When had anyone last held her and let her cry?
I held her. After a while, she lay down, and I thought she was falling
asleep. Then she spoke.

"If God is Change, then...then who loves us? Who cares about us? Who
cares for us?"

"We care for one another," I said. "We care for ourselves and one
another." And I quoted,

*"Kindness eases Change.*

*Love quiets fear."*

At that, she surprised me. She said, "Yes, I liked that one." And she
finished the quote:

*"And a sweet and powerful*

*Positive obsession*

*Blunts pain,*

*Diverts rage,*

*And engages each of us*

*In the greatest,*

*The most intense*

*Of our chosen struggles.*"

"But I have no obsession, positive or otherwise. I have nothing."

"Alaska?" I said.

"I don't know what else to do, where else to go."

"If you get there, what will you do? Go back to being your parents'
housekeeper?"

She glanced at me. "I don't know whether they would let me. I might
never make it over the borders anyway, especially with the war. Border
guards will probably shoot me." She said this with no fear, no passion,
no feeling at all. She was telling me that she was committing a kind of
suicide. She wasn't out to kill herself, but she was going to arrange
for others to kill her---because she didn't know what else to do.
Because no one loved her or needed her for anything at all. From her
parents to her abductors, people were willing to use her and discard
her, but she mattered to no one. Not even to herself. Yet she had kept
herself alive through hell. Did she struggle for life only out of habit,
or because some part of her still hoped that there was something worth
living for?

She can't be allowed to go off to be shot by thugs, border guards, or
soldiers. I can't let her do that. And, I think, she wants to be
stopped. She won't ask to be, and she will fight for her own
self-destructive way. People are like that. But I must think about what
she can do instead of dying---what she should be doing. I must think
about what she can do for Earthseed, and what it can do for her.

From EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

**Are you Earthseed?**

**Do you believe?**

**Belief will not save you.**

**Only actions**

**Guided and shaped**

**By belief and knowledge**

**Will save you.**

**Belief**

**Initiates and guides action---**

**Or it does nothing.**

**W[HEN I WAS 19]{.small}, I met my Uncle Marc.**

**He was, by then, the Reverend Marcos Duran, a slight, still-beautiful
middle-aged man who had become in English and in Spanish the best-known
minister of the Church of Christian America. There was even some talk of
his running for president, although he seemed uncomfortable about this.
By then, though, the Church was just one more Protestant denomination.
Andrew Steele Jarret had been dead for years, and the Church had gone
from being an institution that everyone knew about and either loved or
feared to being a smaller, somewhat defensive organization with much to
answer for and few answers.**

**I had left home. Even though a girl who left home unmarried was seen
by church members as almost a prostitute, I left as soon as I was 18.**

**"If you go," Kayce said, "don't come back. This is a decent,
God-fearing house. You will not bring your trash and your sin back
here!"**

**I had gotten a job caring for children in a household where the father
had died. I had deliberately looked for a job that did not put me at the
mercy of another man---a man who might be like Madison, or worse than
Madison. The pay was room, board, and a tiny salary. I believed I had
clothing and books enough to get me through a few years of working
there, helping to raise another woman's children while she worked in
public relations for a big agribusiness company. I had met the
kids---two girls and a boy---and I liked them. I believed that I could
do this work and save my salary so that when I left, I would have enough
money to begin a small business---a small café, perhaps---of my own. I
had no grand hopes. I only wanted to get away from the Alexanders who
had become more and more intolerable.**

**There was no love in the Alexander house. There was only the habit of
being together, and, I suppose, the fear of even greater loneliness. And
there was the Church---the habit of Church with its Bible class, men's
and women's missionary groups, charity work, and choir practice. I had
joined the young people's choir to get away from Madison. As it
happened, the choir provided relief in three ways. First, I discovered
that I really liked to sing. I was so shy at first that I could hardly
open my mouth, but once I got into the songs, lost myself in them, I
loved it. Second, choir practice was one more excuse that I could use to
get out of the house. Third, singing in the choir was a way to avoid
having to sit next to Madison in church. It was a way to avoid his
nasty, moist little hands. He used to feel me up in church. He really
did that. We would sit down with Kayce between us, then he would get up
to go to the men's room and come back and sit next to me with his coat
or his jacket on his lap to hide his touching me.**

**I believe Kayce realized what was happening. In the days before I
left, we were enemies, she and I. Neither of us said anything about
Madison. We just spent a lot of time hating one another. We didn't talk
unless we had to. Any talk that we couldn't avoid might become a
screaming fight. Then she'd call me a little whore, an ungrateful little
bastard, a heathen witch....During my seventeenth year, I don't think
she and I ever had anything like a conversation.**

**Anyway, I joined the choir. And I discovered that I had a big alto
voice that people enjoyed hearing. I even discovered that church wasn't
so bad if I didn't have to sit between the devil and the deep blue
sea.**

**Because of my singing, I tried to stay with the church after I moved
out of Kayce and Madison's house. I did try. But I couldn't do it.**

**The rumors began at once: I was having sex with any number of men. I
was pregnant. I had had an abortion. I had cursed God and joined my real
mother in a heathen cult. I was spreading lies about Madison....People I
had grown up with, people I had thought of as friends, stopped speaking
to me. Men who had paid no attention to me while I was at home now began
to edge up to me with whispered invitations and unwanted little touches,
and then angry denunciations when I wouldn't give them what they now
seemed to think they had a right to get from me.**

**I couldn't take it. A few months after I left home, I left the church.
That was all right with my employer. She didn't go to church. She had
been raised a Unitarian, but now seemed to have no religious interests.
She liked to spend Sundays with her kids. Sunday was my day off. What I
did with it was up to me.**

**But to my amazement, I missed my adoptive parents. I missed the
church. I missed the life I had grown up with. I missed everything. And
I was so lonely. I dragged myself through my days. Sometimes I barely
wanted to be alive.**

**Then I heard that Reverend Marcos Duran was coming to town, that he
would be preaching at the First Christian American Church of Seattle.
That was the big church, not our little neighborhood thing. The moment I
read that Reverend Duran was coming, I knew I would go to see him. I
knew what a great preacher he was. I had disks of him preaching to
thousands in great CA cathedrals on the Gulf Coast and in Washington,
D.C. He had a big church of his own in New York. He was young to be so
successful, and I had quite a crush on him. God, he was beautiful. And
unlike every other preacher I knew of, he wasn't married. That must have
been rough. Every woman would be after him. Other ministers would
pressure him to get married, accept adult responsibilities, family
responsibilities. Men would look at his handsome face and think he was a
homosexual. Was he? I had heard rumors. But then, I knew about rumors.**

**I camped out all night outside the big church to make sure that I
would be able to get in for services. As soon as I was off duty on
Saturday night, I took a blanket roll, some sandwiches, and a bottle of
water, and went to get a place outside the church. I wasn't the only
one. Even though services would be broadcast free, there were dozens of
people camped around the church when I got there. More kept coming. We
were mostly women and girls sleeping out that night---not that anyone
slept much. There were some men either trying to get close to the women
or looking as though they hoped to get close to Reverend Duran. But
there was nothing blatant. We sang and talked and laughed. I had a great
time. These people were all strangers to me, and I had a great time with
them. They liked my voice and got me to sing some solos. Doing that was
still hard for me, but I had done it in church, so I just put myself
back in church mentally. Then I was into the singing, and the faces of
the others told me they were into my songs.**

**And then a woman came out of the big, handsome house near the church
and made straight for me. I stopped singing because it occurred to me
suddenly that I was disturbing people. It was late. We were having
something very like a party in the street and on the steps of the
church. None of us had even thought that we might be keeping people
awake. I just stopped singing in the middle of a word and everyone
stared at me, then at the woman striding toward me. She was a
light-skinned Black woman with red hair and freckles---a plump,
middle-aged woman, wearing a long green caftan. She came right up to me
as though I were the only one there.**

**"Would your name be Asha Alexander?" she asked.**

**I nodded. "Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry if we disturbed you."**

**She put an envelope in my hand and smiled. "You didn't disturb me,
dear, you have a lovely voice. Read the note. I think you'll want to
answer it."**

**The note said, "If your name is Asha Vere Alexander, I would like to
speak with you. I believe I have information concerning your biological
parents. Marcos Duran."**

**I stared at the red-haired woman's face in shock, and she smiled. "If
you're interested, come with me," she said, and she turned and walked
back toward her house.**

**I wasn't sure I should.**

**"What is it?" one of my new friends asked. She was sitting, wrapped in
her blankets on the church steps, looking from me to the departing
red-haired woman. They were all looking from me to the woman.**

**"I don't know," I said. "Family stuff." And I ran after the woman.**

**And he was there, Marcos Duran, in that big house. The house was the
home of the minister of the First Church. The red-haired woman was the
minister's wife. God, Reverend Duran was even more beautiful in person
than he was on the disks. He was an amazing-looking man.**

**"I've been watching you and your friends and listening to your
singing," he said. "I thought I recognized you. Your adoptive parents
are Kayce and Madison Alexander." It wasn't a question. He was looking
at me as though he knew me, as though he were honestly glad to see me.**

**I nodded.**

**He smiled---a sad kind of smile. "Well, I think we may be related. We
can do a gene check later if you like, but I believe your mother was my
half-sister. She and your father are dead now." He paused, gave me an
odd, uncertain look. "I'm sorry to have to tell you that. They were good
people. I thought you should know about them if you wanted to."**

**"You're sure they're dead?" I asked.**

**He nodded and said again, "I'm sorry."**

**I thought about this, and didn't know what to feel. My parents were
dead. Well, I had thought they might be, in spite of my fantasies.
But...but all of a sudden, I had an uncle. All of a sudden one of the
best-known men in the country was my uncle.**

**"Would you like to hear about your parents?" he asked.**

**"Yes!" I said. "Yes, please. I want to hear everything."**

**So he began to tell me. As I recall it now, he talked about my mother
as a girl with four younger brothers to ride herd on, about Robledo
being wiped out, about Acorn. Not until he began to talk about Acorn did
he begin to lie. Acorn, he said, was a small mountain community---a real
community, not a squatter settlement. But he said nothing about
Earthseed, Acorn's religion. Acorn was destroyed like Robledo, he
continued. My parents met there, married there, and were killed there. I
was found crying in the ruins of the community.**

**He hadn't found out about all this until a couple of years later, and
by then, I had a home and new parents---good Christian Americans, he
believed. He had kept track of me, always meaning to speak to me when I
was older, let me know my history, let me know that I still had a living
member of my biological family.**

**"You look like her," he said to me. "You look so much like her, I
can't believe it. And your voice is like hers. When I heard you singing
out there, I had to get up and go look."**

**He looked at me with something like amazement, then turned and wiped
away a tear.**

**I wanted to touch him, comfort him. That was odd, because I didn't
like touching people. I had been too much alone in my life. Kayce didn't
like to touch people---or at least she didn't like to touch me. She
always said it was too hot or she was too busy or something. She acted
as though hugging or kissing me would somehow have been *nasty.* And of
course, being touched by Madison's moist little hands *was* nasty. But
this man, my uncle...*my uncle!...*made me want to reach out to him. I
believed everything he told me. It never occurred to me not to. I was
awed, flattered, confused, almost in tears.**

**I begged him to tell me more about my parents. I knew nothing, and I
was hungry for any information he could give me. He spent a lot of time
with me, answering my questions and putting me at my ease. The pastor
and his red-haired wife put me up for what was left of the night. And
all of a sudden, I had family.**

**My mother had blundered through the first few years of her life,
knowing early what she wanted to do, but not knowing how to do it,
improvising as she went along. She recruited the people of Acorn because
she came to believe that she could accomplish her purpose by creating
Earthseed communities where children would grow up learning the "truths"
of Earthseed and go on to shape the human future according to those
"truths." This was her first attempt, as she put it, to plant seeds.**

**But she had the bad luck to begin her work at almost the same time
that Andrew Steele Jarret began his, and he was, at least in the short
term, much the stronger. Her only good luck was that he was so much
stronger than she was that he never noticed her. His fanatical
Crusaders, very much one of the fingers of his hand, utterly destroyed
her first effort, but there's no record at all of her ever having come
to Jarret's attention. She was just an ant that he happened to step
on.**

**If she had been anything more than that, she would not have
survived.**

**It is interesting, however, to see that after Acorn, she seemed to
lose her direction until she found Belen Ross. She had written about
wanting to find me, then begin her Earthseed work again---but begin it
how? By establishing another Acorn? One even more hidden away and
low-key?**

**Surely, a new Acorn would be just as vulnerable as the first one. One
gesture of authority could erase it completely. What then? She needed a
different idea, and, in fact, she had one. She knew that she had to
teach teachers. Gathering families had not worked. She had to gather
single people, or at least independent people---people who would learn
from her, then scatter to preach and teach as, in effect, her disciples.
Instead, she was still, reflexively, looking for me. I'm not sure there
was much left of that search but reflex by the time Belen Ross came into
the picture. I've wondered whether Allison Gilchrist---Allie---guessed
this and brought her together with Len just to shake her up.**

[FROM]{.small} *The Journals of Lauren Oya Olamina*

[TUESDAY, JUNE]{.small} 19, 2035

There are three of us now, in a way. We've had an interesting time
becoming three, and I'm not altogether comfortable with the way I
brought it about. It isn't exactly what I expected to do, but I've found
it interesting. We're on the road again, just north of a shiny, new
company town called Hobartville. We bought supplies outside of the walls
of Hobartville at the inevitable squatter settlement. Then we circled
around the town and moved on. It's good to be moving again. We've been
three days in one place.

Until three days ago, we had been walking and making no lingering
contacts on the road---which is an odd way for me to behave. Back in ʼ27
when I was walking from Los Angeles to Humboldt County, I gathered
people, gathered a small community. I thought then that Earthseed would
be born through small, cooperating communities. Once Acorn was
established, I invited others to join us. This time, I haven't felt that
I could invite anyone other than Len to join me.

This time, after all, I was only going to Portland to look for my
daughter and to get my brother to help me find her whether he wanted to
or not.

*And was that any more realistic a goal than Len's intention to walk to
Alaska to rejoin her family?* It was, perhaps less suicidal, but...no
more sensible.

It is my uneasiness, my fear that perhaps this is true, that has kept me
from reaching out to people. I've fed a few ragged parent-child groups
because it's hard for me to see hungry children and do nothing at all.
Yet I couldn't do much. What's a meal, after all? With Acorn, I had done
more. With Earthseed, I had hoped to do much more. So much more....I
still have hopes. Even during the 17 months of Camp Christian, I never
forgot Earthseed, although there were times when I thought I might not
survive to teach it or use it to shape our future.

But all I've been able to do on this trip is to feed a mother and child
here, a father and child there, then send them on their ways. They don't
always want to go.

"How do you know they won't lie in wait and rob us later?" Len asked as
we tramped along I-5 after leaving a father and his two small, ragged
boys eating what I suspected was their first good meal in some time.

"I don't know," I said. "It's unlikely, but it could happen."

"Then why take the chance?"

I looked at her. She met my eyes for a second, then looked away. "I
know," she said in a voice I could hardly hear. "But what good is a
meal? I mean, they'll be hungry again soon."

"Yes," I said. "Jarret would be easier to take if he cared half as much
about children's bodies and minds as he pretends to care about their
souls."

"My father voted for him," she said.

"I'm not surprised."

"My father said he would bring order and stability, get the country back
on its feet again. I remember that. He got my mother to vote for him
too, not that she cared. She would have voted for the man in the moon if
he had told her to, just so he would let her alone. I was still living
at home during the ʼ32 election. I had never been outside our walls. I
thought my father must know what he was talking about, so I was for
Jarret, too. I was too young to vote, though, so it didn't matter. All
the adult servants voted for him. My father stood by the only phone in
the house that servants were allowed to use. He watched as their finger
and retinal prints were scanned in. Then he watched them vote."

"I wonder whether it was your abduction that made your father give up on
Jarret."

"Give up on him?"

"On him and on the United States. He's left the country, after all."

After a moment, she nodded. "Yes. Although I'm still having trouble
thinking of Alaska as a foreign country. I guess that should be easy
now, since the war. But it doesn't matter. None of this matters. I mean,
those people---that man and his kids who you just fed---they matter, but
no one cares about them. Those kids are the future if they don't starve
to death. But if they manage to grow up, what kind of men will they be?"

"That's what Earthseed was about," I said. "I wanted us to understand
what we could be, what we could do. I wanted to give us a focus, a goal,
something big enough, complex enough, difficult enough, and in the end,
radical enough to make us become more than we ever have been. We keep
falling into the same ditches, you know? I mean, we learn more and more
about the physical universe, more about our own bodies, more technology,
but somehow, down through history, we go on building empires of one kind
or another, then destroying them in one way or another. We go on having
stupid wars that we justify and get passionate about, but in the end,
all they do is kill huge numbers of people, maim others, impoverish
still more, spread disease and hunger, and set the stage for the next
war. And when we look at all of that in history, we just shrug our
shoulders and say, well, that's the way things are. That's the way
things always have been."

"It is," Len said.

"It is," I repeated. "There seem to be solid biological reasons why we
are the way we are. If there weren't, the cycles wouldn't keep
replaying. The human species is a kind of animal, of course. But we can
do something no other animal species has ever had the option to do. We
can choose: We can go on building and destroying until we either destroy
ourselves or destroy the ability of our world to sustain us. Or we can
make something more of ourselves. We can grow up. We can leave the nest.
We can fulfill the Destiny, make homes for ourselves among the stars,
and become some combination of what we want to become and whatever our
new environments challenge us to become. Our new worlds will remake us
as we remake them. And some of the new people who emerge from all this
will develop new ways to cope. They'll have to. That will break the old
cycle, even if it's only to begin a new one, a different one.

"Earthseed is about preparing to fulfill the Destiny. It's about
learning to live in partnership with one another in small communities,
and at the same time, working out a sustainable partnership with our
environment. It's about treating education and adaptability as the
absolute essentials that they are. It's..." I glanced at Len, caught a
little smile on her face, and wound down. "It's about a lot more than
that," I said. "But those are the bones."

"Makes a strange sermon."

"I know."

"You need to do what Jarret does."

"What!" I demanded, not wanting to do anything Jarret did.

"Focus on what people want and tell them how your system will help them
get it. Tell folksy stories that illustrate your points and promise the
moon and stars---literally in your case. Why should people want to go to
the stars, anyway? It will cost a lot of money, and time. It will force
us to create whole new technologies. And I doubt that anyone who's alive
when the effort starts will live to see the end of it. Some scientists
might like it. It will give them the chance to work on their pet
projects. And some people might think it's a great adventure, but no
one's going to want to pay for it."

Now I smiled. "Exactly. I've been saying things like that for years.
Some people might want to do it for the sake of their children---to give
them the chance to begin again and do things right this time. But that
idea alone won't do it. It won't bring in enough people, money, or
persistence. Fulfilling the Destiny is a long-term, expensive, uncertain
project---or rather it's hundreds of projects. Maybe thousands. And with
no guarantees of anything. Politicians, on the other hand, are
short-term thinkers, opportunists, sometimes with consciences, but
opportunists nevertheless. Business people are hungry for profit, short-
and long-term. The truth is, preparing for interstellar travel and then
sending out ships filled with colonists is bound to be a job so long,
thankless, expensive, and difficult that I suspect that only a religion
could do it. A lot of people will find ways to make money from it. That
might get things started. But it will take something as essentially
human and as essentially irrational as religion to keep them focused and
keep it going---for generations if it takes generations. I suspect it
will. You see, I have thought about this."

Len thought about it herself for a while, then said, "If that's what you
believe, why don't you tell people to go to the stars because that's
what God wants them to do---and don't start explaining to me that your
God doesn't want anything. I understand that. But most people won't
understand it."

"The people of Acorn did."

"And where are they?"

That hurt like a punch in the face. "No one knows better than I do how
miserably I failed my people," I said.

Len looked away, embarrassed. "I didn't mean it that way," she said.
"I'm sorry. I just mean that what you're saying just isn't something
people are going to understand and get enthusiastic about---at least not
quickly. Did people join Acorn for Earthseed or in the hope of feeding
their kids?"

I sighed and nodded. "They did it to feed their kids and to live in a
community that didn't look down on them for being poor or enslave them
when they were vulnerable. It took some of the adults years to accept
Earthseed. The kids got into it right away, though. I thought the kids
would be the missionary teachers."

"Maybe they would have been, if they'd had the chance. But that way
didn't work. What are you going to do now?"

"With Jarret's Crusaders still running loose? I don't know." This wasn't
entirely true. I did have some ideas, but I wanted to hear what Len had
to say. She had been interesting and thoughtful so far.

"You're good at talking to people," she said. "They like you. Hell, they
trust you. Why can't you just preach to them like any other minister?
Preach the way Jarret does. Have you ever heard any of his speeches?
Most of them are sermons. Newspeople have a hard time opposing anything
he wants because he's always on God's side. Guess whose side that puts
them on?"

"And you think I should do that?"

"Of course you should do that if you believe what you say."

"I'm not a demagogue."

"That's too bad. That leaves the field to people who are demagogues---to
the Jarrets of the world. And there have always been Jarrets. Probably
there always will be."

We walked in silence for a while, then I said, "What about you?"

"What do you mean? You know where I'm going."

"Stay with me. Go somewhere else."

"You're going to Oregon to see your brother and find your child."

"Yes. And I'm also going to make Earthseed what it should be---the way
we humans finally manage to grow up."

"You intend to try again?"

"I don't really have any choice. Earthseed isn't just what I believe.
It's who I am. It's why I exist."

"You say in your book that we don't have purpose, but potential."

I smiled. She had a photographic memory or nearly so. But she wasn't
above using it unfairly to win an argument.

I quoted,

*"We are born*

*Not with purpose,*

*But with potential."*

"We choose our purpose," I said. "I chose mine before I was old enough
to know any better---or it chose me. Purpose is essential. Without it,
we drift."

"Purpose," she said, and with an air of showing off, she quoted:

*"Purpose*

*Unifies us:*

*It focuses our dreams,*

*Guides our plans,*

*Strengthens our efforts.*

*Purpose*

*Defines us,*

*Shapes us,*

*And offers us*

*Greatness."*

She sighed. "Sounds wonderful. But then a lot of things sound wonderful.
What are you going to do?"

"I'm no Jarret," I said, "but you're probably right about the need to
simplify and focus my message. You can help me do that."

"Why should I?"

"Because it will keep you alive."

She looked away again. After a long silence, she said with great
bitterness, "What makes you think I want to be kept alive?"

"I know you do. But if you stick with me, you'll have to prove it."

"What?"

"As a matter of fact, if you stick with me, you'll have all you can do
to stay alive. Ideas like those in Earthseed aren't going to be popular
for a while. Jarret wouldn't like them if he knew about them."

"If you have any sense, you won't draw attention to yourself. Not now."

"I don't intend to draw huge crowds or get on the nets. Not until Jarret
has worn out his welcome, anyway. I do intend to reach out to people
again."

"How?"

And I knew. I had been wondering as we spoke, scrambling for ideas.
Len's comments had helped focus me. So had my own recent experience.
"I'll reach people in their homes," I said. "There's nothing new about
door-to-door missionaries in small cities like Eureka, for instance. In
L.A. you couldn't do it. We may not be able to do it in Portland either.
Portland's gotten so big. But on the way there, and in the larger towns
around Portland, it might work. Small cities and big towns. People in
very large cities and the very small towns can be---will be---suspicious
and vicious."

"Free towns only, I assume," Len said.

"Of course. If I managed to get into a company town, I might be collared
for vagrancy. That can be a life sentence. They just keep charging you
more to live than they pay you for your labor, and you never get out of
debt."

"So I've heard. You want to just knock on people's doors and ask to tell
them about Earthseed? I hear the Jehovah's Witnesses do that. Or they
did it. I'm not sure they still do."

"It's gotten more dangerous." I said. "But other people did it too. The
Mormons and some other lesser-known groups."

"Christian groups."

"I know." I thought for a moment. "Did you know I was 18 when I began
collecting people and establishing Acorn? Eighteen. A year younger than
you are now."

"I know. Allie told me."

"People followed me, though," I continued. "And they didn't only do it
because they were convinced that I could help them get what they wanted.
They followed me because I seemed to be going somewhere. They had no
purpose beyond survival. Get a job. Eat. Get a room somewhere. Exist.
But I wanted more than that for myself and for my people, and I meant to
have it. They wanted more too, but they didn't think they could have it.
They weren't even sure what 'it' was."

"Weren't you wonderful?" Len murmured.

"Don't be an idiot," I said. "Those people were willing to follow an
18-year-old girl because she seemed to be going somewhere, seemed to
know where she was going. People elected Jarret because he seemed to
know where he was going too. Even rich people like your dad are
desperate for someone who seems to know where they're going."

"Dad wanted someone who would protect his investments and keep the poor
people in their places."

"And when he realized that Jarret either couldn't or wouldn't do either,
he left the country. Other people will turn their backs on Jarret, too,
in different ways. But they'll still want to follow people who seem to
know where they're going."

"You?"

I sighed. "Perhaps. More likely, though, it will be people I've taught.
I don't really have the skills that will be needed. Also, I don't know
how long it will take to make Earthseed a way of life and the Destiny a
goal that much of humanity struggles to achieve. I'm afraid that alone
might take my lifetime and yours. It won't be quick. But we'll be the
ones who plant the first seeds, you and I."

Len pushed her black hair away from her face. "I don't believe in
Earthseed. I don't believe in any of this. It's just a lot of simplistic
nonsense. You'll get killed knocking on the doors of strangers, and that
will be the end of it."

"That could happen."

"I want no part of it."

"Yes, you do. If you live, you'll accomplish more that's good and
important than anyone you've ever known. If you die, you'll die trying
to accomplish it."

"I said I want no part of it. It's ridiculous. It's impossible."

"And you have more important things to do?"

Silence.

We didn't talk anymore until we came to a road leading off into the
hills. I turned to follow it, ignoring Len's questions. Where was I
going? I didn't know at all. Perhaps I would just have a look at what
lay up the road, then turn back to the highway. Perhaps not.

Hidden away in the hills, there was a large, two-story wooden farmhouse
set back off the road. It was much in need of paint. It had once been
white. Now it was gray. Alongside it, a woman was weeding her large
vegetable garden. Without telling Len what I meant to do, I walked off
the road, went to her, and asked if we could do her weeding for a meal.

"We'll do a good job," I said. "We'll satisfy you, or no food."

She stared at us both with fear and suspicion. She seemed to be alone,
but might not be. We were clearly armed, but offering no threat. I
smiled. "Just a few sandwiches would be awfully welcome," I said. "We'll
work hard for them." I was dressed in loose clothing as a man. My hair
was cut short. Len tells me I don't make a bad-looking man. We were both
reasonably clean.

The woman smiled in spite of herself---a tentative little smile. "Do you
think you can tell the weeds from the vegetables?" she asked.

I laughed and said, "Yes, ma'am." In my sleep, I thought. But Len was
another matter. She had never done any gardening at all. Her father
hired people to work in their gardens and orchards. She had thin, soft,
uncallused hands and no knowledge of plants. I told her to watch me for
a while. I pointed out the carrots, the various green vegetables, the
herbs, then set her weeding the herbs on hands and knees. She'd have
more control over what she pulled that way. I depended on her memory and
her good sense. If she was angry with me, she would let me know about it
later. Raging at people in public wasn't her style. In fact, we had
plenty of food in our packs, and we weren't yet low on money. But I
wanted to begin at once to reach out to people. Why not stop for a day
on our way to Portland and leave a few words behind in this old gray
house? It was good practice, if nothing else.

We worked hard and got the garden cleaned up. Len muttered and
complained, but I didn't get the impression that she was really
suffering. In fact, she seemed interested in what she was doing and
content to be doing it, although she complained about bugs and worms,
about the way the weeds smelled, about the way the damp earth smelled,
about getting dirty....

I realized that while Len had talked about experiences with her family
and with the servants and experiences with her kidnappers and with
living on her own, scavenging and stealing, she's never talked about
working. She must have done some small jobs for food, but working seems
still to be a novelty for her. I'll have to see that she gets more
experience so that even if she decides to go off on her own, she'll be
better able to take care of herself.

Later in the day, when we had finished the weeding, the woman---who told
us her name was Nia Cortez---gave us a plate of three kinds of
sandwiches. There was egg, toasted cheese, and ham. And there was a bowl
of strawberries, a bowl of oranges, and a pitcher of lemonade sweetened
with honey. Nia sat with us on her side porch, and I got the impression
that she was lonely, shy, and still more than a little afraid of us.
What a solitary place the old house was, dropped amid grassy hills.

"This is beautiful country," I said. "I sketch a little. These rolling
hills, blond grasses, and green trees make me want to sit drawing all
day."

"You can draw?" Nia asked me with a little smile.

And I took my sketchpad from my pack and began to draw not the rolling
hills but Nia's own plump, pleasant face. She was in her late forties or
early fifties and had dark brown hair streaked with gray. Drawn back
into a long, thick horsetail, it hung almost to her waist. Her plumpness
had helped her avoid wrinkles, and her smooth skin was tanned a good
even brown---a nice, uncomplicated face. Her eyes were as clear as a
baby's, and the same dark brown as most of her hair. Drawing someone
gives me an excellent excuse to study them and let myself feel what it
seems to me that they feel. That's what sharing is, after all, and it
comes to me whether I want it or not. I might as well use it. In a rough
and not altogether dependable way, drawing a person helps me *become*
that person and, to be honest, it helps me manipulate that person.
Everything teaches.

She was lonely, Nia was. And she was taking an uncomfortable interest in
me-as-a-man. To curb that interest, I turned to Len, who was watching
everything with sharp, intelligent interest.

"Wrap up a couple of sandwiches for me, would you?" I asked her. "I'd
like to finish this while the light is right."

Len gave me a sidelong glance and used paper napkins to wrap two
sandwiches. Nia, on the other hand, looked at Len almost as though she
had forgotten her. Then, in a moment of confusion, she looked down at
her hands---tools of work, those hands. She seemed more contained, more
restrained when she looked at me again.

I didn't hurry with the drawing. I could have finished it much more
quickly. But working on it, adding detail, gave me a chance to talk
about Earthseed without seeming to proselytize. I quoted verses as
though quoting any poetry to her until one verse caught her interest.
That she could not conceal from me. To her credit, it was this verse:

*"To shape God*

*With wisdom and forethought*

*To benefit your world,*

*Your people,*

*Your life.*

*Consider consequences.*

*Minimize harm.*

*Ask questions.*

*Seek answers.*

*Learn.*

*Teach."*

She had once been a teacher in a public school in San Francisco. The
school had closed 15 years after she began teaching. That was during the
early twenties when so many public school systems around the country
gave up the ghost and closed their doors. Even the pretense of having an
educated populace was ending. Politicians shook their heads and said
sadly that universal education was a failed experiment. Some companies
began to educate the children of their workers at least well enough to
enable them to become their next generation of workers. Company towns
began then to come back into fashion. They offered security, employment,
and education. That was all very well, but the company that educated you
owned you until you paid off the debt you owed them. You were an
indentured person, and if they couldn't use you themselves, they could
trade you off to another division of the company---or another company.
You, like your education, became a commodity to be bought or sold.

There were still a few public school systems in the country, limping
along, doing what they could, but these had more in common with city
jails than with even the most mediocre private, religious, or company
schools. It was the business of responsible parents to see to the
education of their children, somehow. Those who did not were bad
parents. It was to be hoped that social, legal, and religious pressures
would sooner or later force even bad parents to do their duty toward
their offspring.

"So," Nia said, "poor, semiliterate, and illiterate people became
financially responsible for their children's elementary education. If
they were alcoholics or addicts or prostitutes or if they had all they
could do just to feed their kids and maybe keep some sort of roof over
their heads, that was just too bad! And no one thought about what kind
of society we were building with such stupid decisions. People who could
afford to educate their children in private schools were glad to see the
government finally stop wasting their tax money, educating other
people's children. They seemed to think they lived on Mars. They
imagined that a country filled with poor, uneducated, unemployable
people somehow wouldn't hurt them!"

Len sighed. "That sounds like the way my dad thinks. I'm his punishment,
I guess---not that he cares!"

Nia gave her a look of chilly interest. "What? Your father?"

Len explained, and I watched as, almost against her will, Nia thawed. "I
see." She sighed. "I suppose I could have wound up homeless myself, but
my aunt and uncle owned this house and surrounding farmland outright.
This is mother's family home. I came to live here and care for them when
my job ended. They were old and not doing well anymore. Even then they
were renting the farmland to neighboring farmers. They left the house,
the land, and the rest of their possessions to me when they died. I keep
a garden, some chickens, goats, rabbits. I rent the land. I survive."

I tried to ignore a sharp stab of envy and nostalgia.

Len said, "I like your garden." She stared out at the long, neat rows of
vegetables, fruits, and herbs.

"Do you?" Nia asked. "I heard you complaining out there."

Len blushed, then looked at her hands. "I've never done that kind of
thing before. I liked it, but it was hard work."

I smiled. "She's game, if nothing else. I've been doing work like that
all my life."

"You were a gardener?" Nia asked.

"No, it was just a matter of eating or not eating. I've done a number of
things, including teach---although I'm not academically qualified to
teach. But I'm literate, and the idea of leaving children illiterate is
criminal."

As she smiled her delight at hearing such agreement with her own
thoughts, I handed her the drawing. On the lower right side of it I had
written the first verse of Earthseed, "All that you touch, /You
Change...." On the other I had written the "To shape God" verse that she
liked.

She read the verses and looked at the picture for a long, long time. It
was a detailed drawing, not just a sketch, and I felt almost pleased
with it. Then she looked at me and said in a voice almost too soft to
hear, "Thank you."

She asked us to stay the night, offered to let us sleep in her barn,
proving that she hadn't altogether lost her fear of us. We stayed, and
the next day I did a few odd repair jobs around the house for her. I
could have stolen her blind if I'd wanted to, but what I had decided
that I wanted from her, I couldn't steal. She had to give it.

I told her that evening that I was a woman. First, though, I told her
about Larkin. We were in her kitchen. She was cooking. She'd told me to
sit down and talk to her. I'd worked hard, she said. I'd earned a rest.

I never took my eyes off her as I told her. It was important that she
not feel foolish, frightened, or angry when she understood. A little
confusion and mild embarrassment was inevitable, but that should be all.

She looked as though she might cry when she heard about my Larkin. That
was all right. Len was in the living room, delighting in reading real
books made of paper. She would not see any tears Nia shed---in case Nia
was sensitive about that kind of thing. You could never be altogether
sure what another person might feel as a humiliation or an invasion of
privacy.

"What happened to...to the child's mother?" Nia asked.

I didn't answer until she turned to look at me. "It's dangerous on the
road," I said. "You know that. People vanish out there. I walked from
the Los Angeles area to Humboldt County in ʼ27, so I know it. Know it
too well."

"She vanished on the road? She was killed?"

"She vanished on the road to avoid being killed." I paused. "She's me,
Nia."

Silence. Confusion. "But..."

"You've trusted us. Now I'm trusting you. I'm a man on the road. I have
to be. Two women out there would be everyone's target." There. I was not
correcting her, not smiling at the joke I'd played on her. I was making
myself vulnerable to her, and asking her to understand and keep my
secret. Just right, I hoped. It felt right.

She blinked and then stared at me. She left her pots and came over to
take a good look. "I can hardly believe you," she whispered.

And I smiled. "You can, though. I wanted you to know." I drew a deep
breath. "Not that it's safe for a man out there either. The people who
took my child also killed my husband and wiped out my community---all in
the name of God, of course."

She sat down at the table with me. "Crusaders. I've heard of them, of
course---that they rescue homeless orphans and...burn witches, for
heaven's sake. But I've never heard that they...just killed people
and...stole their children." But it seemed that what the Crusaders had
done could not quite get her mind off what I had done. "But you...," she
said. "I can't get over it. I still feel...I still feel as though you
were a man. I mean..."

"It's all right."

She sighed, put her head back and looked at me with a sad smile. "No, it
isn't."

No, it wasn't. But I went to her and hugged her and held her. Like Len,
she needed to be hugged and held, needed to cry in someone's arms. She'd
been alone far too long. To my own surprise, I realized that under other
circumstances, I might have taken her to bed. I had gone through 17
months at Camp Christian without wanting to be with anyone. I missed
Bankole---missed him so much sometimes that it was an almost physical
pain. And I had never been tempted to want to make love with a woman.
Now, I found myself almost wanting to. And she almost wanted me to. But
that wasn't the relationship that I needed between us.

I mean to see her again, this kind, lonely woman in her large, empty,
shabby house. I need people like her. Until I met her, I had not
realized how much I needed such people. Len had been right about what I
should be doing, although she had known no more than I about how it must
be done. I still don't know enough. But there's no manual for this kind
of thing. I suppose that I'll be learning what to do and how to do it
until the day I die.

The three of us talked about Earthseed again over dinner. Most often we
talked of it from the point of view of education. By the time we parted
for the night, I could speak of it as Earthseed without worrying that
Nia would feel harassed or proselytized. We stayed one more day and I
told her more about Acorn, and about the children of Acorn. I held her
once more when she cried. I kissed her lonely mouth, then put her away
from me.

I did two more sketches, each accompanied by verses, and I let her offer
to look after any of the children of Acorn that I could find until their
parents could be contacted. I never suggested it, but I did all I could
to open ways for her to suggest it. She was afraid of the children of
the road, light-fingered and often violent. But she was not, in theory
at least, afraid of the children of Acorn. They were connected with me,
and after three days, she had no fear at all of me. That was very
compelling, somehow, that complete acceptance and trust. It was hard for
me to leave her.

By the time we did leave, she was as much with me as Len was. The verses
and the sketches and memories will keep her with me for a while. I'll
have to visit her again soon---say within the year---to hold on to her,
and I intend to do that. I hope I'll soon be bringing her a child or two
to protect and teach---one of Acorn's or not. She needs purpose as much
as I need to give it to her.

"That was fascinating," Len said to me this morning as we got under way
again, "I enjoyed watching you work."

I glanced at her. "Thank you for working with me."

She smiled, then stopped smiling. "You seduce people. My God, you're
always at it, aren't you?"

"People fascinate me," I said. "I care about them. If I didn't,
Earthseed wouldn't mean anything at all to me."

"Are you really going to bring that poor woman children to look after?"

"I hope to."

"She can barely look after herself. That house looks as though the next
storm will knock it over."

"Yes. I'll have to see what I can do about that, too."

"Do you have that kind of money?"

"No, of course not. But someone does. I don't know how I'm going to do
it, Len, but the world is full of needy people. They don't all need the
same things, but they all need purpose. Even some of the ones with
plenty of money need purpose."

"What about Larkin?"

"I'll find her. If she's alive, I'll find her. I've sworn that."

We walked in silence for a while. There were a few other walkers in
clusters, passing us or walking far ahead or behind us. The broad
highway was broken and old and stretched long in front of us, but it
wasn't threatening, somehow. Not now.

After a while, Len caught my arm and I turned to look at her. It was
good to be walking with someone. Good to have another pair of eyes,
another pair of hands. Good to hear another voice say my name, another
brain questioning, demanding, even sneering.

"What do you want of me?" she asked. "What is it that you want me to do?
You have to tell me that."

"Help me reach people," I said. "Go on working with me, and helping me.
There's so much to be done."

[THURSDAY, JUNE]{.small} 21, 2035

As my father used to quote from his old King James Bible, "Pride goeth
before destruction and an haughty spirit before a fall." He liked to be
accurate about his quotes.

I'm bruised and wounded about the pride, but not destroyed, at least.

I decided yesterday that things had worked out so well with Nia that I
could go on recruiting people as we walked toward Portland. Walking
through a roadside town that seemed big enough for people not to be
alarmed at the sight of a stranger, I stopped to ask a woman who was
sweeping her front porch whether we could do some yard work for a meal.
With no warning, she opened her front door, called her two big dogs, and
told them to get us. We barely got out of her yard in time to avoid
being bitten. Interesting that neither of us drew a gun or uttered a
sound. It turns out that Len's fear of dogs is as strong as mine. Last
night, she showed me some scars given her by a dog that her former
owners had allowed to get too close.

Anyway, the woman with the two dogs cursed us, called us "thieves,
killers, heathens, and witches." She promised to call the cops on us.

"All that just because you asked for work," Len said. "Thank heavens you
didn't try to tell her about Earthseed!" She was cleaning a long, deep
scratch on her arm. It came from a nail that stuck out from the woman's
wooden gate. I had spotted the dogs in time to shove her back through
the gate, dive through myself, then slam the gate by grabbing a bottom
slat and yanking. I only just let go in time to avoid a lot of long,
sharp teeth, and damned if the dog didn't bite one of the wooden slats
of the fence in frustration at not being able to get at me. I had
skinned hands and a bruised hip. Len had her long scratch, which hurt
and bled enough to scare me. Later, I treated us both to tetanus skin
tabs. They cost more than they should, but neither of us is up-to-date
on our immunizations anymore. Best not to take unnecessary chances.

"I wonder what happened to that woman to make her willing to do a thing
like that," I said as we walked this morning.

"She was out of her mind," Len said. "That's all."

"That's rarely all," I said.

Then early today, a farm woman drove us off with a rifle and I decided
to quit trying for a day or two. A storekeeper told us that Jarret's
Crusaders have been active in the area. They've been rounding up
vagrants, singling out witches and heathens, and generally scaring the
hell out of householders by warning them about the dangers and evils of
strangers from the road.

It was interesting to see how angry the storekeeper was. The Crusaders,
he said, are bad for business. They collar his highway customers or
frighten them away, and they intimidate his local customers so that he's
lost a lot of his regulars---the ones who live a long way from his
store. They've learned to shop as close to home as they can with little
regard for quality or price.

"Jarret says he can't control his own Crusaders," the man said. "Next
time out, I'll vote for someone who'll put the bastards in jail where
they belong!"

**I [DON'T KNOW THAT]{.small} Uncle Marc would ever have told me the
truth about my mother. I don't believe he intended to. He never wavered
from his story that she was dead, and I never suspected that he was
lying. I loved him, believed in him, trusted him completely. When he
found out how I was living, he invited me to live with him and continue
my education. "You're a bright girl," he said, "and you're family---the
only family I have. I couldn't help your mother. Let me help you."**

**I said yes. I didn't even have to think about it. I quit my job and
went to live in one of his houses in New York. He hired a housekeeper
and tutors and bought computer courses to see to it that I had the
college education that Kayce and Madison wouldn't have provided for me
if they could have. Kayce used to say, "You're a girl! If you know how
to keep a clean, decent house and how to worship God, you know
enough!"**

**I even went back to church because of Uncle Marc. I went back to the
Church of Christian America, physically, at least. I lived at his second
home in upstate New York, and I attended church on Sundays because he
wanted me to, and because I was so used to doing it. I was comfortable
doing it. I sang in the choir again and did regular charity work,
helping to care for old people in one of the church nursing homes. Doing
those things again was like slipping into a comfortable old pair of
shoes.**

**But the truth was, I had lost whatever faith I once had. The church I
grew up in had turned its back on me just because I moved out of the
home of people who, somehow, never learned even to like me. Forget love.
Fine behavior for good Christian Americans, trying to build a strong,
united country.**

**Better, I decided after much thought and much reading of history, to
live a decent life and behave well toward other people. Better not to
worry about the Christian Americans, the Catholics, the Lutherans, or
whatever. Each denomination seemed to think that it had the truth and
the only truth and its people were going to bliss in heaven while
everyone else went to eternal torment in hell.**

**But the Church wasn't only a religion. It was a community---my
community. I didn't want to be free of it. That would have been---had
been---impossibly lonely. Everyone needs to be part of something.**

**By the time I got my Master's in history, I found that I couldn't
muster any belief in a literal heaven or hell, anyway. I thought the
best we could all do was to look after one another and clean up the
various hells we've made right here on earth. That seemed to me a big
enough job for any person or group, and that was one of the good things
that Christian America worked hard at.**

**I went on living in Uncle Marc's upstate New York house. Once I had my
Master's, I began work on my Ph.D. Also, I began creating Dreamask
scenarios. Dreamask International hired me on the strength of several
scenarios I had done for them on speculation.**

**Now, thanks to Uncle Marc, I had the Dreamask scenario recorder I had
longed for when I was little. Now I had the freedom to create pretty
much anything I wanted to. I did my work under the name Asha Vere. I
wanted no connection with the Alexanders, yet I felt uncomfortable about
trading on my connection with Uncle Marc, and calling myself Duran. At
the time, I believed Duran was my mother's family name. My father's
surname, "Bankole," meant nothing to me since Uncle Marc couldn't tell
me much about Taylor Franklin Bankole---only that he was a doctor and
very old when I was  born. Asha Vere was name enough for me. It dated me
as a child born during the popularity of a particular early Mask, but
that didn't matter. And the Dreamask people kind of liked it.**

**I worked at home on my Masks and on my Ph.D., and was so casual about
the degree that I was 32 before I completed it. I enjoyed the work,
enjoyed Marc's company when he came to me to get away from his public
and enjoy some feeling of family. I was happy. I never found anyone I
wanted to marry. In fact, I had never seen a marriage that I would have
wanted to be part of. There must be good marriages somewhere, but to me,
marriage had the feel of people tolerating each other, enduring each
other because they were afraid to be alone or because each was a habit
that the other couldn't quite break. I knew that not everyone's marriage
was as sterile and ugly as Kayce's and Madison's. I knew that
intellectually, but emotionally, I couldn't seem to escape Kayce's cold,
bitter dissatisfaction and Madison's moist little hands.**

**Uncle Marc, on the other hand, had said without ever quite saying it
that he preferred men sexually, but his church taught that homosexuality
was sin, and he chose to live by that doctrine. So he had no one. Or at
least, I never knew him to have anyone. That looks bleak on the page,
but we each chose our lives. And we had one another. We were a family.
That seemed to be enough.**

**Meanwhile, my mother was giving her attention to her other child, her
older and best beloved child, Earthseed.**

**Somehow we---or at least *I---*never paid much attention to the
growing Earthseed movement. It was out there. In spite of the efforts of
Christian America and other denominations, there were always cults out
there. Granted, Earthseed was an unusual cult. It financed scientific
exploration and inquiry, and technological creativity. It set up grade
schools and eventually colleges, and offered full scholarships to poor
but gifted students. The students who accepted had to agree to spend
seven years teaching, practicing medicine, or otherwise using their
skills to improve life in the many Earthseed communities. Ultimately,
the intent was to help the communities to launch themselves toward the
stars and to live on the distant worlds they found circling those
stars.**

**"Do you know anything about these people?" I asked Uncle Marc after
reading and hearing a few news items about them.**

**"Are they serious? Interstellar emigration? My god, why don't they
just move to Antarctica if they want to rough it?" And he surprised me
by making a straight line of his mouth and looking away. I had expected
him to laugh.**

**"They're serious," he said. "They're sad, ridiculous, misled people
who believe that the answer to all human problems is to fly off to Alpha
Centauri."**

**I did laugh. "Is a flying saucer coming for them or what?"**

**He shrugged. "They're pathetic. Forget about them."**

**I didn't, of course. I left my usual haunts on the nets and began to
research them. I wasn't serious. I didn't plan to do anything with what
I learned, but I was curious---and I might get an idea for a Mask. I
found that Earthseed was a wealthy sect that welcomed everyone and was
willing to make use of everyone. It owned land, schools, farms,
factories, stores, banks, several whole towns. And it seemed to own a
lot of well-known people---lawyers, physicians, journalists, scientists,
politicians, even members of Congress.**

**And were they all hoping to fly off to Alpha Centauri?**

**It wasn't that simple, of course. But to tell the truth, the more I
read about Earthseed, the more I despised it. So much needed to be done
here on earth---so many diseases, so much hunger, so much poverty, such
suffering, and here was a rich organization spending vast sums of money,
time, and effort on nonsense. Just nonsense!**

**Then I found *The Books of the Living* and I accessed images and
information concerning Lauren Oya Olamina.**

**Even after reading about my mother and seeing her I didn't notice
anything. I never looked at her image and thought, "Oh, she looks like
me." She did look like me, though---or rather, I looked like her. But I
didn't notice. All I saw was a tall, middle-aged, dark-skinned woman
with arresting eyes and a nice smile. She looked, somehow, like someone
I would be inclined to like and trust---which scared me. It made me
immediately dislike and distrust her. She was a cult leader, after all.
She was supposed to be seductive. But she wasn't going to seduce me.**

**And all that was only my reaction to her image. No wonder she was so
rich, no wonder she could draw followers even into such a ridiculous
religion. She was dangerous.**

Portland.

I've gathered a few more people. They aren't people who will travel with
me or come together in easily targetable villages. They're people in
stable homes---or people who need homes.

Isis Duarte Norman, for instance, lives in a park between the river and
the burned, collapsed remains of an old hotel. She has a shack
there---wood covered with plastic sheeting. Each evening she can be
found there. During the day she works, cleaning other women's houses.
This enables her to eat and keep herself and her secondhand clothing
clean. She has a hard life, but it's as respectable as she can make it.
She's 43. The man she married when she was 23 dumped her six years ago
for a 14-year-old girl---the daughter of one of his servants.

"She was so beautiful," Isis said. "I knew he wouldn't be able to keep
his hands off her. I couldn't protect her from him any more than I could
protect myself, but I never thought that he would keep her and throw me
out,"

He did. And for six years, she's been homeless and all but hopeless. She
said she had thought of killing herself. Only fear had stopped her---the
fear of not quite dying, of maiming herself and dying a slow, lingering
death of pain and starvation. That could happen. Portland is a vast,
crowded city. It isn't Los Angeles or the Bay Area, but it is huge.
People ignore one another in self-defense. I find this both useful and
frightening. When I met Isis, it was because I went to the door of a
home where she was working. Otherwise, she would never have dared to
talk to me. As it was, she was designated to assemble a meal and bring
it to me when I had finished cleaning up the backyard.

She was wary when she brought the food. Then she looked at the backyard
and told me I had done a good job. We talked for a while. I walked her
to her shack---which made her nervous. I was a man again. I find it
inconvenient and dangerous to be on the street as a homeless woman.
Other people manage it well. I don't, somehow.

I left Isis without seeing the inside of her shack. Best not to push
people. Best, as Len says, to seduce them. I've seen Isis several times
since then. I've talked with her, read verses to her, captured her
interest. She has two half-grown children who live with their father's
mother, so she cares, in spite of herself, about what the future will
bring. I intend to find a real home for her by getting her a live-in job
looking after children. That might take time, but I intend to do it.

On the other hand, I've met and gathered in Joel and Irma Elford, who
hired me when I first came to Portland to paint a garage and a fence and
do some yard work. Len and I worked together, first cutting weeds,
harvesting row crops, raking, cleaning the yard at the back of the
property where a wilderness had begun to grow. Then, when the dust
settled, we painted the garage. We would have to get to the fence the
next day. We were to get hard currency for this job, and that put us in
a good mood. Len is a likable person to work with. She learns fast,
complains endlessly, and does an excellent job, however long it takes.
Most of the time, she enjoys herself. The complaining was just one of
her quirks.

Then Joel and Irma invited us in to eat with them at their table. I had
done a quick sketch of Irma to catch her attention, and added a verse
that was intended to reach her through environmental interests that I
had heard her express:

*There is nothing alien*

*About nature.*

*Nature*

*Is all that exists.*

*It's the earth*

*And all that's on it.*

*It's the universe*

*And all that's in it.*

*It's God,*

*Never at rest.*

*It's you,*

*Me,*

*Us,*

*Them,*

*Struggling upstream*

*Or drifting down.*

Also, perhaps because her mother had died the year before, Irma also
seemed touched by this fragment of funeral oration.

*We give our dead*

*To the orchards*

*And the groves.*

*We give our dead*

*To life.*

We were an unexpected novelty, and the Elfords were curious about us.
They let us wash up in their back bathroom and change into cleaner
clothing from our packs. Then they sat us down, fed us a huge meal, and
began to ask us questions. Where were we going? Did we have homes?
Families? No? Well, how long had we been homeless? What did we do for
shelter in rough weather? Weren't we afraid "out there"?

I answered for both of us at first, since Len did not seem inclined to
talk, and I answered as often with Earthseed verses as with ordinary
conversation. It didn't take long for Irma to ask, "What is it you're
quoting from?" And then, "May I see it? I've never heard of it." And,
"Is this Buddhist? No, I see that it isn't. I very nearly became a
Buddhist when I was younger." She's 37. "Very simple little verses. Very
direct. But some of them are lovely."

"I want to be understood," I said. "I want to make it easy for people to
understand. It doesn't always work, but I was serious about the effort."

Irma was all I could have hoped for. "You wrote these? You? Really? Then
tell me please, on page 47..."

They're quiet, childless, middle-aged people who choose to live in a
modest, middle-class neighborhood even though they could afford their
own walled enclave. They're interested in the world around them and
worried about the direction the country has taken. I could see their
wealth in the beautiful, expensive little things they've scattered
around their home---antique silver and crystal, old leather-bound paper
books, paintings, and, for a touch of the modern, a cover-the-earth
phone net system that includes, according to Len, the latest in Virtual
rooms. They can have all the sights and other sensations of visiting
anyplace on earth or any programmed-in imaginary place, all without
leaving home. And yet they were interested in talking to us.

We had to be careful, though. The Elfords may be bored and hungry for
both novelty and purpose, but they're not fools. I had to be more open
with them than I have been with people like Isis. I told them much of my
own story, and I told them what I'm trying to do. They thought I was
brave, naive, ridiculous, and...interesting. Out of pity and curiosity
they let us sleep in the comfortable little guest house at the back of
their property.

The next day, when we had painted the fence, they found more small jobs
for us to do, and now and then, they talked to us. And they let us talk
to them. They never lost interest.

"What will you ask them to do?" Len said to me that night as we settled
in again in the guest house. "You have them, you know, even if they
don't realize it yet."

I nodded. "They're hungry for something to do," I said, "starved for
some kind of real purpose. I think they'll have some suggestions
themselves. They'll feel better if they make the first suggestions.
They'll feel in control. Later, I want them to take Allie in. This guest
house would be perfect for her and Justin. When they see what she can do
with a few sticks of wood and simple tools, they'll be glad to have her.
And I think I'll introduce Allie to Isis. I have the feeling they'll hit
it off."

"The Elfords have all but seduced themselves for you," Len said.

I nodded. "Think about all the other people we've met who've given us
nothing but trouble. I'm glad to meet eager, enthusiastic people now and
then."

And of course, I've found my brother again. I find that I've not wanted
to talk about that.

Marc has been preaching at one of the big Portland shelters, helping out
with shelter maintenance, and attending a Christian American seminary.
He wants to be an ordained minister. He was not happy to see me. I kept
showing up to hear him and leaving notes that I wanted a meeting. It
took him two weeks to give in.

"I suppose if I moved to Michigan, you'd turn up there," he said by way
of greeting.

We were meeting in his apartment building---which was more like a big
dormitory. Because he wasn't permitted to have guests in his apartment,
we met in the large dining room just off the lobby. It was a clean, dim,
plain room crowded with mismatched wooden tables and chairs and nothing
else. Its walls were a dim gray-green and the floor was gray tile worn
through to the wood in spots. We were alone there, drinking what I was
told would be hot cinnamon-apple tea. When I bought a cup from the
machine, I found that it tasted like tepid, slightly sweet water. The
lights in the room were few, weak, and far apart, and the place worked
hard at being as dreary and cheerless as could be managed.

"Service to God is what's important," my brother said, and I realized
that I had been looking around and making my unspoken criticism obvious.

"I'm sorry," I said. "If you want to be here, then you should be here. I
wish, though...I wish you could spare a little concern for your niece."

"Don't be so condescending! And I've told you what you should do to find
her!"

Join CA. I shuddered. "I can't. I just can't. If Cougar were here, could
you enlist with him again---just as a job, you know? Could you become
one of his helpers?"

"It's not the same!"

"It's the same to me. What Cougar did to you, CAs Crusaders did to me.
The only difference is they did it to me longer. And don't tell me the
Crusaders are just renegades. They're not. They're as much part of CA as
the shelters are. I spotted one of the men who raped and lashed us at
Acorn. He was working as an armed guard at the Eureka shelter."

Marc stood up. He all but pushed his chair over in his eagerness to get
away from me. "I've finally got a chance to have what I want," he said.
"You're not going to wreck it for me!"

"This isn't about you," I said, still seated. "I wish you had a child,
Marc. If you did, you might be able to understand what it's like not to
know where she is, whether she's being well treated, or even...even
whether she's still alive. *If I could only know*!"

He stood over me for a very long time, looking down at me as though he
hated me. "I don't believe you feel anything," he said.

I stared back at him amazed. "Marc, my daughter---"

"You think you're supposed to care, so you pretend to. Maybe you even
want to, but you don't."

I think I preferred it when he hit me. I couldn't react except to sit
staring at him. Tears spilled from my eyes, but I didn't realize it at
the time. I just sat frozen, staring.

After a while, my brother turned and walked away, tears glistening on
his own face.

By then, I wanted to hate him. I couldn't quite, but I wanted to.

"Brothers!" Len muttered when I told her what had happened. She had
waited for me at the Elford guesthouse. She listened to what I told her
and, I suppose, heard it according to her own experience.

"He needs to make everything my fault," I said. "He still can't let
himself admit what Christian America did to me. He couldn't stay with
them if they did such things, so he's decided that they're innocent, and
somehow everything is my fault."

"Why are you making excuses for him?" Len demanded.

"I'm not. I think that's really what he's feeling. He had tears on his
face when he walked away from me. He didn't want me to see that, but I
saw it. He has to drive me away or he can't have his dreams. Christian
America is teaching him to be the only thing I think he's ever wanted to
be---a minister. Like our father."

She sighed and shook her head. "So what are you going to do?"

"I...don't know. Maybe the Elfords can suggest something."

"Them, yes....Irma asked me while you were gone whether you would be
willing to speak to a group of her friends. She wants to have a party
and, I suppose, show you off."

"You're kidding!"

"I said I thought you would do it."

I got up and went to look out the window at a pear tree, dark against
the night sky. "You know, if I could only find my daughter, I would
think my life was going along beautifully."

[SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER]{.small} 16, 2035

I've managed to get Marc to meet with me again at last.

He may be the only relative I have left on earth. I don't want him as an
enemy.

"Just tell me you'll help my Larkin if you ever find her," I said.

"How could I do less?" he asked, still with a certain coldness.

"I wish you well, Marc. I always have. You're my brother, and I love
you. Even with all that's happened, I can't help loving you."

He sighed. We were sitting in his building's vast, drab dining room
again. This time there were other people scattered around, eating late
lunches or early dinners. Most were men, young and old, individuals and
small groups. Some stared at me with what seemed to be disapproval. "You
can't know what Christian America has meant to me," he said. His voice
had softened. He looked less distant.

"Of course I can," I told him. "I'm here because I do understand. You'll
be a Christian American minister, and I'll be your heathen sister. I can
stand that. What I find hard to stand is being your enemy. I never meant
for that to happen."

After a while, he said, "We aren't enemies. You're my sister, and I love
you too."

We shook hands. I don't think I've ever shaken hands with my brother
before, but I got the feeling that it was as much contact as he was
willing to endure, at least for now.

Allie and Justin have come to Portland to live. I phoned Allie and told
her to use some of the money I left with her to buy a ride up with the
Georges. The Elfords have agreed to let the two of them live in their
guest house. Len and I have been given rooms above the garage at the
home of another supporter---a friend of the Elfords.

That's how I've come to think of these people---as supporters. We speak
to groups in their houses. We lead discussions and teach the truths of
Earthseed. I say "we" because Len has begun to take a more active part.
She will teach on her own someday, and perhaps train someone to help
her. As I write those words, I miss her as though she had already gone
off on her own, as though I already had some new young skeptic to train.

Through the Elfords and their friends and the friends of their friends,
we've received invitations to speak all over town in people's homes and
in small halls. I've found that in each group there is one person,
perhaps two, who are serious, who hear in Earthseed something that they
can accept, something they want, something they need. These are the ones
who will make our first schools possible.

In Acorn, it was no accident that the church and the school were the
same. They weren't just the same building. They were the same
institution. If the Earthseed Destiny is to have any meaning beyond a
distant mythical paradise, Earthseed must be not only a belief system
but a way of life. Children should be raised in it. Adults should be
reminded of it often, refocused on it, and urged toward it. Both should
understand how their current behavior is or isn't contributing to
fulfillment of the Destiny. By the time we're able to send Earthseed
children to college, they should be dedicated not only to a course of
study but to the fulfillment of the Destiny. If they are, then any
course of study they choose can become a tool for the fulfillment.

[SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER]{.small} 30, 2035

I've found a potential home for Travis and Natividad. I've called them
several times, and gotten no answer. I worried about them until last
night when I reached them. They've been living in a squatter camp a few
miles from Sacramento. They went there on a rumor that some of Acorn's
children had been seen there. The rumor was false, but their money had
run low. They'd had to stop and take jobs doing agricultural work. This
was rough because the work paid little more than room and board in
horrible little shacks.

They'll come here with the Mora girls and the new Mora baby. I can't
restore their children to them, but I can see to it that they have work
that sustains them and a decent place to live. They'll live in the big
house that is to be our first school. The house belongs to one of my
supporters---one who said those magic words: "What can I do? What do you
need?"

What don't we need!

The house is a big empty shell that the Douglas and Mora families will
have to work hard on. It needs paint, repairs, landscaping, fencing,
everything. But it has living room for a big family upstairs and
teaching and working room downstairs. It will be a new beginning in so
many ways. And the people who own it have relatives in both city and
state government. They're the kind of people Jarret's Crusaders have
learned to let alone.

Also, next month, Len and I are invited to teach at several homes in the
Seattle area.

[TUESDAY, NOVEMBER]{.small} 13, 2035

I've finally talked Harry into coming north. He's run across the
Figueroas and joined with them for the trip. He hasn't found Tabia or
Russ, I'm sorry to say, but he has picked up three orphans. He found
them on the road just north of San Luis Obispo. Their mother was hit by
a truck. He saw it happen and went straight to the kids. There are more
and more vehicles on the road during the day now. Walking is becoming
more dangerous.

As horrible as the hit and run was, I get the feeling it's given Harry
what he needs---children to protect, children who need him, children who
run to him and hold his hands when they're scared. He and Zahra always
said they wanted a big family. He's such a good daddy. I have a teaching
job for him in Seattle. I believe he'll thrive in it if he can let
himself.

Jorge Cho and his family are coming. I've found work for Jorge and Di in
Portland.

Now I have to look around for places for the Figueroas.

I believe that I've finally done it. I believe that my life has finally
educated me enough to enable me to make a real start at planting

Earthseed. It may be too soon to say this, but it feels true. I believe
it is true.

I've allowed the Elfords to make *The First Book of the Living*
available free on the nets. I never expected to make money from the
book. My only fear has been that someone would take it and change it,
make it an instrument of some other theology or use it for some new
brand of demagoguery. Joel Elford says the best way to avoid that is to
make it available on every possible net and with my name on it. And, of
course, the copyright is my legal fallback if someone does begin to
misuse it seriously.

"I don't think you realize what you have," Joel told me.

I looked at him in surprise and realized that he believed what he was
saying.

"And you don't realize how many other people will want it," he
continued. "I've aimed the book particularly at the nets that are
intended to interest American universities and the smaller free cities
where so many of those universities are located. It will go out
worldwide, but it will draw more attention to itself in those places."

He was smiling, so I asked, "What are you expecting to happen?"

"You're going to start hearing from people," he said. "You'll soon have
more attention than you'll know what to do with." He sobered. "And what
you actually do with it is important. Be careful." Irma trusted me more
than Joel did. Joel was still watching me---watching with a great deal
of interest. He says it's like watching a birth.

[SUNDAY, DECEMBER]{.small} 30, 2035

I've been traveling.

That's nothing new for me, but this is different. This time, thanks to
the book, I've been invited by university groups and others, and paid to
travel, paid to speak---which is a little like paying ice to be cold.

And I've been flying. Flying! I've walked over most of the West Coast,
and now I've flown over the interior of the country and over much of the
East Coast. I've flown to Newark, Delaware; Clarion, Pennsylvania; and
up to Syracuse, New York. Next, I go to Toledo, Ohio; Ann Arbor,
Michigan; Madison, Wisconsin; and Iowa City, Iowa.

"Not a bad first tour," Joel told me before I left. "I thought you'd
arouse interest. People are ready for something new and hopeful."

I was scared to death, worried about flying and worried about speaking
to so many strangers. What if I attracted the wrong kind of attention?
How would Len handle the experience? And I worried about Len, who seemed
to be even more afraid than I was, especially about flying. I had spent
more money than I should have, buying us both decent clothing.

Then Joel and Irma were taking us to the airport in their huge car. One
way in which they do indulge themselves is to keep a late-model armed
and armored car---a civilian maggot, really. The thing cost as much as a
nice house in a good neighborhood, and it's scary-looking enough to
intimidate anyone stupid enough to spend their time hijacking vehicles.

"We've never had to use the guns," Irma told me when she showed them to
me. "I don't like them. They frighten me. But being without them would
frighten me more."

So now Len and I are lecturing and conducting Earthseed Workshops. We're
being paid in hard currency, fed well, and allowed to live in good, safe
hotels. And we're being welcomed, listened to, even taken seriously by
people who are hungry for something to believe in, some difficult but
worthwhile goal to involve themselves in and work toward.

We've also been laughed at, argued with, booed, and threatened with
hellfire---or gunfire. But Jarret's kind of religion and Jarret himself
are getting less and less popular these days. Both, it seems, are bad
for business, bad for the U.S. Constitution, and bad for a large
percentage of the population. They always have been, but now more and
more people are willing to say so in public. The Crusaders have
terrorized some people into silence, but they've just made others very
angry.

And I'm finding more and more people who have the leisure now to worry
about the nasty, downward slide that the country's been on. In the
2020s, when these people were sick, starving, or trying to keep warm,
they had no time or energy to look beyond their own desperate
situations. Now, though, as they're more able to meet their own
immediate needs, they begin to look around, feel dissatisfied with the
slow pace of change, and with Jarret, who with his war and his
Crusaders, has slowed it even more. I suppose it would have been
different if we'd won the war.

Anyway, some of these dissatisfied people are finding what they want and
need in Earthseed. They're the ones who come to me and ask, "What can I
do? I believe. Now how can I help?"

So I've begun to reach people. I've reached so many people from Eureka
to Seattle to Syracuse that I believe that even if I were killed
tomorrow, some of these people would find ways to go on learning and
teaching, pursuing the Destiny. Earthseed will go on. It will grow. It
will force us to become the strong, purposeful, adaptable people that we
must become if we're to grow enough to fulfill the Destiny.

I know things will go wrong now and then. Religions are no more perfect
than any other human institutions. But Earthseed will fulfill its
essential purpose. *It will force us to become more than we might ever
become without it.* And when it's successful, it will offer us a kind of
species life insurance. I wish I could live to see that success. I wish
I could be one of those who go out to take root among the stars. I can
only hope that my Larkin will go---or perhaps some of her children, or
even Marc's children.

Whatever happens, as long as I'm alive, I won't stop working, preaching,
aiming people toward the Destiny. I've always known that sharing
Earthseed was my only true purpose.

From EARTHSEED: THE BOOKS OF THE LIVING

**Earthseed is adulthood.**

**It's trying our wings,**

**Leaving our mother,**

**Becoming men and women.**

**We've been children,**

**Fighting for the full breasts,**

**The protective embrace,**

**The soft lap.**

**Children do this.**

**But Earthseed is adulthood.**

**Adulthood is both sweet and sad.**

**It terrifies.**

**It empowers.**

**We are men and women now.**

**We are Earthseed.**

**And the Destiny of Earthseed**

**Is to take root among the stars.**

**U[NCLE MARC WAS, IN]{.small} the end, my only family.**

**I never saw Kayce and Madison again. I sent them money when they were
older and in need, and I hired people to look after them, but I never
went back to them. They did their duty toward me and I did mine toward
them.**

**My mother, when I finally met her, was still a drifter. She was
immensely rich---or, at least, Earthseed was immensely rich. But she had
no home of her own---not even a rented apartment. She drifted between
the homes of her many friends and supporters, and between the many
Earthseed Communities that she established or encouraged in the United
States, Canada, Alaska, Mexico, and Brazil. And she went on teaching,
preaching, fund-raising, and spreading her political influence. I met
her when she visited a New York Earthseed community in the
Adirondacks---a place called Red Spruce.**

**In fact, she went to Red Spruce to rest. She had been traveling and
speaking steadily for several months, and she needed a place where she
could be quiet and think. I know this because it was what people kept
telling me when I tried to reach her. The community protected her
privacy so well that for a while, I was afraid I might never get to see
her. I'd read that she usually traveled with only an acolyte or two and,
sometimes, a bodyguard, but now it seemed that everyone in the community
had decided to guard her.**

**By then, I was 34, and I wanted very much to meet her. My friends and
Uncle Marc's housekeeper had told me how much I looked like this
charismatic, dangerous, heathen cult leader. I had paid no attention
until, in researching Lauren Olamina's life, I discovered that she had
had a child, a daughter, and that that daughter had been abducted from
an early Earthseed community called Acorn.**

**The community, according to Olamina's official biography, had been
destroyed by Jarret's Crusaders back in the 30s. Its men and women had
been enslaved for over a year by the Crusaders, and all the prepubescent
children had been abducted. Most had never been seen again.**

**The Church of Christian America had denied this and sued Olamina and
Earthseed back in the 2040s when Olamina's charge first came to their
attention. The church was still powerful, even though Jarret was dead by
then. The rumors were that Jarret, after his single term as President,
drank himself to death. A coalition of angry business people, protestors
against the Al-Can War, and champions of the First Amendment worked hard
to defeat him for re-election in 2036. They won by exposing some of the
earliest Christian American witch-burnings. It seems that between 2015
and 2019, Jarret himself took part in singling people out and burning
them alive. The Pox, then a growing malignancy, had been both the excuse
and the cover for this. Jarret and his friends had burned accused
prostitutes, drug dealers, and junkies. Also, in their enthusiasm, they
burned some innocent people---people who had nothing to do with the sex
trade or drugs. When that happened, Jarret's people covered their
"mistakes" with denials, threats, more terror, and occasional payoffs to
the bereaved families. Uncle Marc researched this himself several years
ago, and he says it's true---true and sad and wrong, and in the end,
irrelevant. He says Jarret's teachings were right even if the man
himself did wrong.**

**Anyway, the Church of Christian America sued Olamina for her "false"
accusations. She countersued. Then suddenly, without explanation, CA
dropped its suit and settled with her, paying her an unreported, but
reputedly vast sum of money. I was still a kid growing up with the
Alexanders when all this happened, and I heard nothing about it. Years
later, when I began to research Earthseed and Olamina, I didn't know
what to think of it.**

**I phoned Uncle Marc and asked him, point-blank, whether there was any
possibility that this woman could be my mother.**

**On my phone's tiny monitor, Uncle Marc's face froze, then seemed to
sag. He suddenly looked much older than his 54 years. He said, "I'll
talk to you about this when I come home." And he broke the connection.
He wouldn't take my calls after that. He had never refused my calls
before. Never.**

**Not knowing what else to do, where else to turn, I checked the nets to
see where Lauren Olamina might be speaking or organizing. To my
surprise, I learned that she was "resting" at Red Spruce, less than a
hundred kilometers from where I was.**

**And all of a sudden, I had to see her.**

**I didn't try to phone her, didn't try to reach her with Uncle Marc's
well-known name or my own name as a creator of several popular Masks. I
just showed up at Red Spruce, rented a room at their guest house, and
began trying to find her.**

**Earthseed doesn't bother with a lot of formality. Anyone can visit its
communities and rent a room at a guest house. Visitors came to see
relatives who were members, came to attend Gatherings or other
ceremonies, even came to join Earthseed and arrange to begin their
probationary first year.**

**I told the manager of the guest house that I thought I might be a
relative of Olamina's and asked him if he could tell me how I might make
an appointment to speak with her. I asked him because I had heard people
call him "Shaper" and I recognized that from my reading as a title of
respect akin to "reverend" or "minister." If he was the community's
minister, he might be able to introduce me to Olamina himself.**

**Perhaps he could have, but he refused. Shaper Olamina was very tired,
and not to be bothered, he told me. If I wanted to meet her, I should
attend one of her Gatherings or phone her headquarters in Eureka,
California, and arrange an appointment.**

**I had to hang around the community for three days before I could find
anyone willing to take my message to her. I didn't see her. No one would
even tell me where she was staying within the community. They protected
her from me courteously, firmly. Then, all of a sudden, the wall around
her gave way. I met one of her acolytes and he took my message to her.**

**My messenger was a thin, brown-haired young man who said his name was
Edison Balter. I met him in the guest-house dining room one morning as
we each sat alone, eating bagels and drinking apple cider. I pounced on
him as someone I hadn't pestered yet. I had no idea at that time what
the Balter name meant to my mother or that this man was an adopted son
of one of her best friends. I was only relieved that someone was
listening to me, not closing one more door in my face.**

**"I'm her aide this trip," he told me. "She says I'm just about ready
to go out on my own, and the idea scares the hell out of me. What name
shall I give her?"**

**"Asha Vere."**

**"Oh? Are you the Asha Vere who does Dreamasks?"**

**I nodded.**

**"Nice work. I'll tell her. You want to put her in one of your Masks?
You know you do look a lot like her. Like a softer version of her." And
he was gone. He talked fast and moved very fast, but somehow without
seeming to hurry. He didn't look anything like Olamina himself, but
there was a similarity. I found that I liked him at once---just as I'd
at first found myself liking her. Another likable cultist. I got the
feeling that Red Spruce, a clean, pretty mountain community, was nothing
but a nest of seductively colorful snakes---a poisonous place.**

**Then Edison Balter came back and told me he would take me to her. She
was somewhere in her fifties---58, I remembered from my reading. She was
born way back in 2009, before the Pox. My god. She was old. But she
didn't look old, even though her black hair was streaked with gray. She
looked big and strong and, in spite of her pleasant, welcoming
expression, just a little frightening. She was a little taller than me,
and maybe a little more angular. She looked...not hard, but as though
she could be hard with just the smallest change of expression. She
looked like someone I wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of. And,
yes, even I could see it. She looked like me.**

**She and I just stood looking at one another for a long, long time.
After a while, she came up to me, took my left hand, and turned it to
look at the two little moles I have just below the knuckles. My impulse
was to pull away, but I managed not to.**

**She stared at the moles for a while, then said, "Do you have another
mark---a kind of jagged dark patch just here?" She touched a place
covered by my blouse on my left shoulder near my neck.**

**This time, I did step away from her touch. I didn't mean to, but I
just don't like to be touched. Not even by a stranger who might be my
mother. I said, "I have a birthmark like that, yes."**

**"Yes," she whispered, and went on looking at me. After a moment, she
said, "Sit down. Sit here with me. You are my child, my daughter. I know
you are."**

**I sat in a chair instead of sharing the couch with her. She was open
and welcoming, and somehow, that made me want all the more to draw
back.**

**"Have you only just found out?" she asked.**

**I nodded, tried to speak, and found myself stumbling and stammering.
"I came here because I thought...maybe...because I looked up information
about you, and I was curious. I mean, I read about Earthseed, and people
said I looked like you, and...well, I knew I was adopted, so I
wondered."**

**"So you had adoptive parents. Were they good to you? What's your life
been like? What do you....ˮ She stopped, drew a deep breath, covered her
face with both hands for a moment, shook her head, then gave a short
laugh. "I want to know everything! I can't believe that it's you. I...."
Tears began to stream down her broad, dark face. She leaned toward me,
and I knew she wanted to hug me. She hugged people. She touched people.
She hadn't been raised by Kayce and Madison Alexander.**

**I looked away from her and shifted around trying to get comfortable in
my chair, in my skin, in my newfound identity. "Can we do a gene print?"
I asked.**

**"Yes. Today. Now." She took a phone from her pocket and called
someone. No more than a minute later, a woman dressed all in blue came
in carrying a small plastic case. She drew a small amount of blood from
each of us, and checked it in a portable diagnostic from her case. The
unit wasn't much bigger than Olamina's phone. In less than a minute,
though, it spit out two gene prints. They were rough and incomplete, but
even I could see both their many differences and their many unmistakably
identical points.**

**"You're close relatives," the woman said. "Anyone would guess that
just from looking at you, but this confirms it."**

**"We're mother and daughter," Olamina said.**

**"Yes," the woman in blue agreed. She was my mother's age or older---a
Puerto Rican woman by her accent. She had not a strand of gray in her
black hair, but her face was lined and old. "I had heard, Shaper, that
you had a daughter who was lost. And now you've found her."**

**"She's found me," my mother said.**

**"God is Change," the woman said, and gathered her equipment. She
hugged my mother before she left us. She looked at me, but didn't hug
me. "Welcome," she said to me in soft Spanish, and then again, "God is
Change." And she was gone.**

**"Shape God," my mother whispered in a response that sounded both
reflexive and religious.**

**Then we talked.**

**"I had parents." I said. "Kayce and Madison Alexander. I....We didn't
get along. I haven't seen them since I turned 18. They said, 'If you
leave without getting married, don't come back!' So I didn't. Then I
found Uncle Marc, and I finally---"**

**She stood up, staring down at me, staring with such a closed look
frozen on her face. It shut me out, that look, and I wondered whether
this was what she was really like---cold, distant, unfeeling. Did she
only pretend to be warm and open to deceive her public?**

**"When?" she demanded, and her tone was as cold as her expression.
"When did you find Marc? When did you learn that he was your uncle? How
did you find out? Tell me!"**

**I stared at her. She stared back for a moment, then began to pace. She
walked to a window, faced it for several seconds, staring out at the
mountains. Then she came back to look down at me with what I could only
think of as quieter eyes.**

**"Please tell me about your life," she said. "You probably know
something about mine because so much has been written. But I know
nothing about yours. Please tell me."**

**Irrationally, I didn't want to. I wanted to get away from her. She was
one of those people who sucked you in, made you like her before you
could even get to know her, and only then let you see what she might
really be like. She had millions of people convinced that they were
going to fly off to the stars. How much money had she taken from them
while they waited for the ship to Alpha Centauri? My god, I didn't want
to like her. I wanted the ugly persona I had glimpsed to be what she
really was. I wanted to despise her.**

**Instead, I told her the story of my life.**

**Then we had dinner together, just her and me. A woman who might have
been a servant, a bodyguard, or the lady of the house brought in a tray
for us.**

**Then my mother told me the story of my birth, my father, my abduction.
Hearing about it from her wasn't like reading an impersonal account. I
listened and cried. I couldn't help it.**

**"What did Marc tell you?" she asked.**

**I hesitated, not sure what to say. In the end, I told the truth just
because I couldn't think of a decent lie. "He said you were dead---that
both my mother and my father were dead."**

**She groaned.**

**"He...he took care of me," I said. "He saw to it that I got to go to
college, and that I had a good place to live. He and I...well, we're a
family. We didn't have anyone before we found one another."**

**She just looked at me.**

**"I don't know why he told me you were dead. Maybe he was
just...lonely. I don't know. We got along, he and I, right from the
first. I still live in one of his houses. I can afford a place of my own
now, but it's like I said. We're a family." I paused, then said
something I had never admitted before. "You know, I never felt that
anyone loved me before I met him. And I guess I never loved anyone until
he loved me. He made it...safe to love him back."**

**"Your father and I both loved you," she said. "We had tried for two
years to have a baby. We worried about his age. We worried about the way
the world was---all the chaos. But we wanted you so much. And when you
were born, we loved you more than you can imagine. When you were taken,
and your father was killed...I felt for a while as though I'd died
myself. I tried so hard for so long to find you."**

**I didn't know what to say to that. I shrugged uncomfortably. She
hadn't found me. And Uncle Marc had. I wondered just how hard she'd
really looked.**

**"I didn't even know whether you were still alive," she said. "I wanted
to believe you were, but I didn't know. I got involved in a lawsuit with
Christian America back in the forties, and I tried to force them to tell
me what had happened to you. They claimed that any record there may have
been of you was lost in a fire at the Pelican Bay Children's Home years
before."**

**Had they said that? I supposed they might have. They would have said
almost anything to avoid giving up evidence of their abductions---and
giving a Christian American child back to a heathen cult leader. But
still, "Uncle Marc says he found me when I was two or three years old,"
I said. "But he saw that I had good Christian American parents, and he
thought it would be best for me to stay with them, undisturbed." I
shouldn't have said that. I'm not sure why I did.**

**She got up and began to walk again---quick, angry pacing, prowling the
room. "I never thought he would do that to me," she said. "I never
thought he hated me enough to do a thing like that. I never thought he
could hate *anyone* that much. I saved him from slavery! I saved his
worthless life, goddamnit!"**

**"He doesn't hate you," I said. "I'm sure he doesn't. I've never known
him to hate anyone. He thought he was doing right."**

**"Don't defend him," she whispered. "I know you love him, but don't
defend him to me. I loved him myself, and see what he's done to me---and
to you."**

**"You're a cult leader," I said. "He's Christian American. He
believed---"**

**"I don't care! I've spoken with him hundreds of times since he found
you, and he said nothing. Nothing!"**

**"He doesn't have any children." I said. "I don't think he ever will.
But I was like a daughter to him. He was like a father to me."**

**She stopped her pacing and stood staring down at me with an almost
frightening intensity. She stared at me as though she hated me.**

**I stood up, looked around for my jacket, found it, and put it on.**

**"No!" she said. "No, don't go." All the stiffness and rage went out of
her. "Please don't go. Not yet."**

**But I needed to go. She is an overwhelming person, and I needed to get
away from her.**

**"All right," she said when I headed for the door. "But you can always
come to me. Come back tomorrow. Come back whenever you want to. We have
so much time to make up for. My door is open to you, Larkin, always."**

**I stopped and looked back at her, realizing that she had called me by
the name that she had given to her baby daughter so long ago. "Asha," I
said, looking back at her. "My name is Asha Vere."**

**She looked confused. Then her face seemed to sag the way Uncle Marc's
had when I phoned him to ask about her. She looked so hurt and sad that
I couldn't stop myself from feeling sorry for her. "Asha," she
whispered. "My door is open to you, Asha. Always."**

**The next day Uncle Marc arrived, filled with fear and despair.**

**"I'm sorry," he said to me as soon as he saw me. "I was so happy when
I found you after you left your parents. I was so glad to be able to
help you with your education. I guess...I had been alone so long that I
just couldn't stand to share you with anyone."**

**My mother would not see him. He came to me almost in tears because he
had tried to see her and she had refused. He tried several more times,
and over and over again, she sent people out to tell him to go away.**

**I went back home with him. I was angry with him, but even angrier with
her, somehow. I loved him more than I'd ever loved anyone no matter what
he had done, and she was hurting him. I didn't know whether I would ever
see her again. I didn't know whether I should. I didn't even know
whether I wanted to.**

**My mother lived to be 81.**

**She kept her word. She never stopped teaching. For Earthseed, she used
herself up several times over speaking, training, guiding, writing,
establishing schools that boarded orphans as well as students who had
parents and homes. She found sources of money and directed them into
areas of study that brought the fulfillment of the Earthseed Destiny
closer. She sent promising young students to universities that helped
them to fulfill their own potential.**

**All that she did, she did for Earthseed. I did see her again
occasionally, but Earthseed was her first "child," and in some ways her
only "child."**

**She was planning a lecture tour when her heart stopped just after her
eighty-first birthday. She saw the first shuttles leave for the first
starship assembled partly on the Moon and partly in orbit. I was not on
any of the shuttles, of course. Neither was Uncle Marc, and neither of
us has children.**

**But Justin Gilchrist was on that ship. He shouldn't have been at his
age, of course, but he was. And the son of Jessica Faircloth has gone,
ironically. He's a biologist. The Mora girls, their children, and the
whole surviving Douglas family have gone. They, in particular, were her
family. All Earthseed was her family. We never really were, Uncle Marc
and I. She never really needed us, so we didn't let ourselves need her.
Here is the last journal entry of hers that seems to apply to her long,
narrow story.**

[FROM]{.small} *The Journals of Lauren Oya Olamina*

[THURSDAY, JULY]{.small} 20, 2090

I know what I've done.

I have not given them heaven, but I've helped them to give themselves
the heavens. I can't give them individual immortality, but I've helped
them to give our species its only chance at immortality. I've helped
them to the next stage of growth. They're young adults now, leaving the
nest. It will be rough on them out there. It's always rough on the young
when they leave the protection of the mother. It will take a
toll---perhaps a heavy one. I don't like to think about that, but I know
it's true. Out there, though, among the stars on the living worlds we
already know about and on other worlds that we haven't yet dreamed of,
some will survive and change and thrive and some will suffer and die.

Earthseed was always true. I've made it real, given it substance. Not
that I ever had a choice in the matter. If you want a thing---truly want
it, want it so badly that you need it as you need air to breathe, then
unless you die, you will have it. Why not? It has you. There is no
escape. What a cruel and terrible thing escape would be if escape were
possible.

The shuttles are fat, squat, ugly, ancient-looking space trucks. They
look as though they could be a hundred years old. They're very different
from the early ones under the skin, of course. The skin itself is
substantially different. But except for being larger, today's space
shuttles don't look that different from those a hundred years ago. I've
seen pictures of the old ones.

Today's shuttles have been loaded with cargoes of people, already deeply
asleep in DiaPause---the suspended-animation process that seems to be
the best of the bunch. Traveling with the people are frozen human and
animal embryos, plant seeds, tools, equipment, memories, dreams, and
hopes. As big and as space-worthy as they are, the shuttles should sag
to the Earth under such a load. The memories alone should overload them.
The libraries of the Earth go with them. All this is to be off-loaded on
the Earth's first starship, the *Christopher Columbus.*

I object to the name. This ship is not about a shortcut to riches and
empire. It's not about snatching up slaves and gold and presenting them
to some European monarch. But one can't win every battle. One must know
which battles to fight. The name is nothing.

I couldn't have watched this first Departure on a screen or in a virtual
room or in some personalized version beneath a Dreamask. I would have
traveled across the world on foot to see this Departure if I'd had to.
This is my life flying away on these ugly big trucks. This is my
immortality. I have a right to see it, hear the thunder of it, smell it.

I will go with the first ship to leave after my death. If I thought I
could survive as something other than a burden, I would go on this one,
alive. No matter. Let them someday use my ashes to fertilize their
crops. Let them do that. It's arranged. I'll go, and they'll give me to
their orchards and their groves.

Now, with my friends and the children of my friends, I watch. Lacy
Figueroa, Myra Cho, Edison Balter and his daughter, Jan, and Harry
Balter, bent, gray, and smiling. It took Harry so long to learn to smile
again after the loss of Zahra and the children. He's a man who should
smile. He stands with one arm around his granddaughter and the other
around me. He's my age. Eighty-one. Impossible. Eighty-one! God is
Change.

My Larkin would not come. I begged her, but she refused. She's caring
for Marc. He's just getting over another heart transplant. How
completely, how thoroughly he has stolen my child. I have never even
tried to forgive him.

Now, I watch as, one by one, the ships lift their cargoes from the
Earth. I feel alone with my thoughts until I reach out to hug each of my
friends and look into their loved faces, this one solemn, that one
joyous, all of them wet with tears. Except for Harry, they'll all go
soon in these same shuttles. Perhaps Harry's ashes and mine will keep
company someday. The Destiny of Earthseed is to take root among the
stars, after all, and not to be filled with preservative poisons, boxed
up at great expense, as is the revived fashion now, and buried uselessly
in some cemetery. I know what I've done.

# A Biography of Octavia E. Butler {#calibre_link-55 .center}

Octavia E. Butler (1947--2006) was a bestselling and award-winning
author, considered one of the best science fiction writers of her
generation. She received both the Hugo and Nebula awards, and in 1995
became the first author of science fiction to receive a MacArthur
Fellowship. She was also awarded the prestigious PEN Lifetime
Achievement Award in 2000.

Butler's father died when she was very young; her mother raised her in
Pasadena, California. Shy, tall, and dyslexic, Butler immersed herself
in reading whatever books she could find. She began writing at twelve,
when a B movie called *Devil Girl from Mars* inspired her to try writing
a better science-fiction story.

She took writing classes throughout college, attending the Clarion
Writers Workshop and, in 1969, the Open Door Workshop of the
Screenwriters' Guild of America, a program designed to mentor Latino and
African American writers. There she met renowned science fiction author
Harlan Ellison, who adopted Butler as his protégé.

In 1974 she began writing *Patternmaster* (1976), set in a future world
where a network of all-powerful telepaths dominate humanity. Praised
both for its imaginative vision and for Butler's powerful prose, the
novel spawned four prequels, beginning with *Mind of My Mind* (1977) and
finishing with *Clay's Ark* (1984).

Although the Patternist series established Butler among the science
fiction elite, *Kindred* (1979) brought her mainstream success. In that
novel, a young black woman travels back in time to the antebellum South,
where she is called on to protect the life of a white, slaveholding
ancestor. *Kindred*'s protagonist stood out in a genre that, at the
time, was widely dominated by white men.

In 1985, Butler won Nebula and Hugo awards for the novella *Bloodchild*,
which was reprinted in 1995 as *Bloodchild and Other Stories*. *Dawn*
(1987) began the Xenogenesis trilogy, about a race of aliens who visit
earth to save humanity from itself. *Adulthood Rites* (1988) and *Imago*
(1989) continue the story, following the life of the first child born
with a mixture of alien and human DNA.

*Fledgling* (2005), which combines vampire and science fiction
narratives, was Butler's final novel. "She wasn\'t writing romance or
feel-good novels," mystery author Walter Mosley said. "She was writing
very difficult, brilliant work." Her books have been translated into
several languages, and continue to appear widely in school and college
literature curricula.

Butler died at home in Washington in 2006.
