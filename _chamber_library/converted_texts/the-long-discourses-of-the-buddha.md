[It is with much pleasure that I write this brief foreword to Mr Walshe's translation of the [Dīgha Nikāya.]{.italic} The translator is a devout Buddhist whose Pali scholarship is backed up by personal practice of meditation. His translation work is therefore a most important contribution to the study of Buddhism.]{.calibre8}

[Mr Walshe has been active in the Buddhist world of Great Britain for many years. Long before I came to Britain, his name was known to me through his essays in 'The Wheel' series of the Buddhist Publication Society of Sri Lanka. In 1977 my venerable teacher, Tan Ajahn Chah Subhatto and I arrived in London at the invitation of the English Sangha Trust of which Mr Walshe was one of the Trustees. This Trust had been established in 1956 in order to bring about a Western Sangha in Britain, and towards this end, Mr Walshe has consistently worked for nearly thirty years. At one time he combined this with the post of Vice-President of the Buddhist Society of Great Britain, his career at the Institute of Germanic Studies in London University (of which his translations of the sermons of Meister Eckhart are a testimonial), as well as studying Pali in his spare time.]{.calibre8}

[Even though Pali scholars have produced quite accurate literal translations of the Pali Canon, one often feels the lack of profound insight into these remarkable scriptures. The Suttas need to be studied, reflected on, and practised in order to realise their true meaning. They are 'Dhamma discourses', or contemplations on the 'way things are'. They are not meant to be 'sacred scriptures' which tell us what to believe. One should read them, listen to them, think about them, contemplate them, and investigate the present reality, the present experience with them. Then, and only then, can one insightfully know the Truth beyond words.]{.calibre8}

[The two main reasons for making this translation of some of the oldest Buddhist scriptures are: (1) The spread of Buddhism as a serious way of life in the Western world, and of even more widespread serious interest in it as a subject worthy of close study, and (2) the fact that English is now effectively the world language, the most widespread linguistic vehicle for all forms of communication. True, the Pali scriptures have already been translated in almost their entirety into English, mainly through the devoted efforts of the Pali Text Society, which has now entered into the second century of its activity. But existing translations are now dated stylistically as well as containing many errors and a modem version has therefore become necessary.]{.calibre8}

[First, and foremost, the entire merit for this translation belongs to the Venerable Balangoda Ānandamaitreya Mahā Nāyaka Thera, Aggamahāpaṇḍita (though he has, of course, no need of such [puñña)]{.italic} for having convinced me that I could, and therefore of course should, undertake this task.

Rahula who guided my early, faltering steps in Pali, as well as the Ven. P. Vipassi and Messrs K.R. Norman and L.S. Cousins, whose collective brains I have picked on knotty points. It is fitting also to pay tribute here to the Ven. Achaan Cha (Bodhiñāṇa Thera) and his illustrious pupil Achaan Sumedho, whose efforts in establishing a flourishing branch of the Sangha in Britain have made such translation work all the more necessary; and --- others please note! --- much remains to be done in this field.]{.calibre8}

[My principles of translation are briefly discussed in the Introduction. I am aware of a few trifling inconsistencies as well as a few repetitions in the notes. The former will, I think, cause no inconvenience: they were hard to avoid altogether in this, quite possibly the last, translation these scriptures will receive without benefit of electronic gadgetry. And as for the repetitions, these can perhaps be overlooked in connection with a text which is itself so repetitious.]{.calibre8}

[Siddhattha Gotama (in Sanskrit, Siddhartha Gautama), who became the Buddha, the Enlightened One, may have lived from about 563-483 B.C., through many modern scholars suggest a later dating.[^1^](#The_Long_Dis-_of_the_Buddha_split_126.html_filepos1341009){#The_Long_Dis-_of_the_Buddha_split_011.html_filepos30746 .calibre9} Oriental traditions offer a number of alternative datings, that favoured in Sri Lanka and south-east Asia being 623-543. It was on this basis that the 2500th anniversary of his passing into final Nibbāna was celebrated, as [Buddha Jayanti,]{.italic} in the East in 1956-57. He belonged to the Sakya clan dwelling on the edge of the Himalayas, his actual birthplace being a few miles north of the present-day Indian border, in Nepal. His father, Suddhodana, was in fact an elected chief of the clan rather than the king he was later made out to be, though his title was [rājā-a]{.italic} term which only partly corresponds to our word 'king'. Some of the states of North India at that time were kingdoms and others republics, and the Sakyan republic was subject to the powerful king of neighbouring Kosala, which lay to the south.]{.calibre8}

[Disentangling the probable facts from the mass of legend surrounding Gotama's life, we may assume the following to be approximately correct. Though brought up to a life of luxury, the young prince was overcome by a sense of the essentially sorrowful aspect of life, and he decided to seek the cause and cure of this state which he termed [dukkha]{.italic} (conventionally but inadequately rendered 'suffering' in English). At the age of twenty-nine he renounced the world, going forth 'from the household life into homelessness' in accordance with an already well-established tradition, thus joining the ranks of the wandering ascetics [(samaṇas:]{.italic} see p. 22). He went successively to two teachers, Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta, who taught him how to attain to high meditative states. Realising, however, that even the attainment of these states did not solve his problem, Gotama went off on his own and practised severe austerities for six years, gathering a little group of five ascetics around him. However, finding that even the most extreme forms of asceticism likewise did not lead to the goal, he abandoned these excesses, and sat down at the foot of a tree by the river Nerañjarā, at the place now known as Bodh Gaya, determined not to arise from the spot until enlightenment should dawn. During that night he passed beyond the meditative stages he had previously reached, and attained to complete liberation as the Buddha-the Enlightened or Awakened One. He spent the remaining forty-five years of his life wandering up and down the Ganges Valley, expounding the doctrine that he had found and establishing the Sangha or Order of Buddhist monks and nuns, which still exists today.]{.calibre8}

[India in the Buddha's day did not yet suffer from the grinding poverty of the present time. The modem caste system had not fully developed, but we find its germ in the division of society into four groups or 'colours' (Pali [vaṇṇā).]{.italic} The designation betrays the origin of the distinction, being based on the conquest of northern India in about 1600 B.C. by the comparatively light-skinned Aryans, who looked down on those of darker hue they found there. In the context of Buddhism, where this racial and aristocratic term (literally 'noble') is applied to the nobility of the spirit, we shall use the form Ariyan, based on Pali.]{.calibre8}

[The Brahmins were the guardians of the religious cult brought into India by the Aryans. In later, non-Buddhist sources we always hear of the Brahmins as taking the leading place in society. Buddhist sources, however (Sutta 3, for example), assert the supremacy of the Khattiyas (Skt. [kṣatriya),]{.italic} the Noble or Warrior class to which Gotama belonged. It appears that while further west the Brahmins had already established their supremacy, this was not yet the case in the Ganges valley. In the third place came the Vessas (Skt. [vaiśya)]{.italic} or merchants, and finally the Suddas (Skt. [śudra)]{.italic} or workers. Below these there were certainly some slaves (we even hear of a Sudda having a slave), and some unfortunates of the class who were later to become known as 'untouchables'. But in addition to these groupings, there were considerable numbers of people, including at least a few women, who had opted out of conventional society.]{.calibre8}

[The religious situation in northern India around 500 B.C. is very interesting, and was undoubtedly exceptionally favourable to the development of the Buddhist and other faiths. Though the Brahmins formed an important and increasingly powerful hereditary priesthood, they were never, like their counterparts elsewhere, able to assert their undisputed authority by persecuting and perhaps exterminating other religious groups. It seems that some Brahmins would not have been averse to such a course, but it was not open to them. They were a caste set aside from other men (in reading about them in the Buddhist texts, one is insistently reminded of the New Testament picture of the Pharisees, though in both cases the picture presented is, to say the least, one-sided). They alone were learned in the Three Vedas, knew the mystic mantras, and could conduct the all-important, bloody and expensive sacrifices. In fact, not all Brahmins exercised their priestly functions; some had settled down to agriculture or even trade, while continuing to expect the deference which they regarded as their due.]{.calibre8}

[The earlier (Dravidian?) inhabitants who had been overrun by the Aryans were the creators of the Indus Valley civilisation with the great cities of Harappā and Mohenjo Dāro, all now in Pakistan. And it is to this civilisation that we must look for the origins of the second stream of religious life, that of the [samanas]{.italic} (Skt. [śramaṇas).]{.italic} These have sometimes been absurdly called 'recluses', whereas the term really means the very opposite. True, a [samaṇa]{.italic} might occasionally be a recluse, a hermit shut away from the world in a rocky cell, but the more usual type was a wandered who had indeed 'abandoned the world' to lead a more or less ascetic life. He - or, rarely, she - was in fact, to use a modem expression, a drop-out from society, though differing from our modem drop-outs in at least one important respect: the [samaṇas]{.italic} as a group received no less respect from all classes, even kings, than did the Brahmins (see Sutta 2, verse 25ff.). Their teachings were many and varied --- some wise and some exceedingly foolish, some loftily spiritual and some crudely materialistic. The point is that they were completely free to teach whatever they pleased, and, so far from being persecuted as they might have been elsewhere, were received with honour wherever they went. We can distinguish several different groups of these people. There were in particular the selfmortifiers on the one hand, and the wanderers on the other, whose only austerity probably consisted in their detachment from family ties and, in theory at least, their observance of chastity. Many of the bizarre and often revolting practices of the first group are detailed in Sutta 8, verse 14. As pointed out in a note to that Sutta, the practice of extreme austerity ([tapas]{.italic}) should not be called 'penance' because the motivation is entirely different from that of a Christian penitent, to whom such people might be superficially compared. The word [tapas,]{.italic} which basically means 'heat', is used both for the austere practices indulged in and for the result they are intended to achieve, which is power, that is, the development of various paranormal powers. The belief was that these could be achieved by means of such practices and, in particular, by sexual restraint. Thus, so far from practising austerity like the Christian penitent, to atone for past sins, they undertook these practices in the hope of future powers, including, perhaps, those very joys that had been temporarily renounced.]{.calibre8}

[The wanderers [(paribbājakas),]{.italic} some of whom were Brahmins, wore clothes (unlike many of the others, who went completely naked), and they led a less uncomfortable life. They were 'philosophers' who propounded many different theories about the world and nature, and delighted in disputation. The Pali Canon introduces us to six well-known teachers of the time, all of whom were older than Gotama. They are Pūraṇa Kassapa, an amoralist, Makkhali Gosāla, a determinist, Ajita Kesakambali, a materialist, Pakudha Kaccāyana, a categorialist, the Nigantha Nātaputta (the Jain leader known to us as Mahāvīra), who was a relativist and eclectic, and Sañjaya Belatthaputta, an agnostic sceptic or positivist (I borrow most of the descriptive epithets from Jayatilleke). Their different views are quoted by King Ajātasattu in Sutta 2, verses 16-32.]{.calibre8}

[Besides these there were the propounders of the originally secret teaching incorporated in the Upanisads which came to be grafted on to orthodox Brahmanism, and whose doctrines were later to form the core of the Vedānta system. For them, the impersonal Brahman is the supreme reality, and the goal of the teaching is the realisation that the individual human soul or self [(ātman)]{.italic} is ultimately identical with the universal Self ([Ātman]{.italic}), which is another term for Brahman (the capitalisation here is merely for clarity: the teaching was at first and for long oral, and even when written down in an Oriental alphabet, such a distinction could not be made, since capital letters do not exist in any Eastern script). These [aupaniṣadas]{.italic} are not mentioned in the Pali Canon, though it is almost (but not, perhaps, quite) certain that Gotama was acquainted with their teachings.]{.calibre8}

[It has been urged that 'at depth there is no contradiction between the greatest insights of the Upanisads and the Buddha's teaching' - a view that would be contested by many. We shall return very briefly to this point later (page 31). Suffice it to say here that any theory that the Buddha taught a doctrine of a supreme Self can only be said to fly in the face of the evidence. Nor is it true, as is sometimes said, that in ancient India everybody believed in karma (the law of moral cause and effect) and rebirth, or indeed in anything else. There were, as we have seen, materialists, sceptics and equivocators, and all sorts of fantastic theorists. Neither can we accept the statement that the Buddha was 'a Hindu who sought to reform the ancient religion'. Apart from the anachronistic use of the term 'Hindu', this is wrong because he rejected the claims of the Brahmins as religious authorities and, while not totally denying the existence of their gods, assigned to these a fundamentally unimportant role in the scheme of things. In so far as he belonged to any existing tradition, it was that of the [samaṇas,]{.italic} and like them he taught as he saw fit. As a teacher he was not beholden to anyone: he agreed or disagreed with tradition or the views of others entirely in accordance with his sovereign perception of the truth. It is, however, correct to say that the situation in India in his time was particularly favourable to the spread of his teaching, while the Teacher's long life enabled this to become firmly established in his lifetime and under his direction.]{.calibre8}

One who has gained this state can, it is said, no longer be born in 'states of woe' and is assured of attaining Nibbāna after, at the most, seven more lives.]{.calibre8}

The other, less pessimistic view is that while lay persons can attain to the first three paths, only monks can become Arahants. There is no scriptural authority for either idea. It should also be mentioned that the Arahant ideal is one that is perfectly valid for all schools of Buddhism. Likewise, the concept of the Bodhisattva, who renounces the enjoyment of Nirvana in order to bring all beings to enlightenment, which is considered the hallmark of the Mahayana schools as opposed to the Hīnayāna,[^3^](#The_Long_Dis-_of_the_Buddha_split_126.html_filepos1342315){#The_Long_Dis-_of_the_Buddha_split_016.html_filepos51474 .calibre9} in fact exists in Theravada Buddhism as well.

[The Sanskrit form is better known in the West than the Pali [Nibbāna.]{.italic} There are, not surprisingly, many misapprehensions about this. In fact it has been said by one witty scholar that all we have to go on is our misconception of Nirvana, because until we have realised it we cannot know it as it really is. But if we cannot say much about what it is, we can at least say something about what it is [not]{.italic}. Robert Caesar Childers, in his famous and still useful Pali dictionary (1875), devoted a whole long article, in fact a short treatise, to proving to his own satisfaction that Nibbana implies total extinction, and this view, though certainly erroneous, is still to be met with among some Western scholars. And yet, it would be odd indeed if Buddhists were supposed to have to tread the entire path right up to the attainment of Arahantship merely in order to finish up with that total obliteration which the materialists, and many ordinary people today, assume to occur for all of us, good, bad and indifferent, at the end of our present life. It is true, some colour is given to this idea by the etymology of the term (nir + √vā = 'blowing out' as of a lamp). Contrasted with this, however, we find other very different descriptions of Nibbāna. Thus in Sutta 1.3.20 it is used for 'the highest happiness', defined as the indulgence in the pleasures of the five senses --- obviously a non-Buddhist use of the word, though it is not otherwise attested in pre-Buddhist sources. We thus find two apparently contradictory meanings of Nibbana: 1. 'extinction', 2. 'highest bliss'. And while these were wrongly used in the examples quoted, they both occur in authentic texts.]{.calibre8}

Without such an understanding, one will necessarily misconceive Nibbāna - according to one's either materialistic or metaphysical leanings --- either as annihilation of an ego, or as an eternal state of existence into which an Ego or Self enters or with which it merges.]{.calibre8}

[What this in effect means is that in order to 'understand' Nibbāna one should have 'entered the Stream' or gained First Path, and thus have got rid of the fetter of personality-belief. While scholars will continue to see it as part of their task to try to understand what the Buddha meant by Nibbāna, they should perhaps have sufficient humility to realise that this is something beyond the range of purely scholarly discussion. In the systematisation of the Abhidhamma (see p. 52), Nibbāna is simply included as the 'unconditioned element' [(asankhatadhātu),]{.italic} but with no attempt at definition. Nibbāna is indeed the extinction of the 'three fires' of greed, hatred and delusion, or the destruction of the 'corruptions' [(āsavā)]{.italic} of sense-desire, becoming, wrong view and ignorance. Since the individual 'self' entity is not ultimately real, it cannot be said to be annihilated in Nibbāna, but the [illusion]{.italic} of such a self is destroyed.]{.calibre8}

It is ineffable. It can, however, be realised, and its realisation is the aim of the Buddhist practice. While no description is possible, positive references to Nibbana are not lacking: thus at Dhammapada 204 and elsewhere it is called 'the highest bliss' [(paramam sukhaṁ),]{.italic} and we may conclude this brief account with the famous quotation from Udana 8.3:]{.calibre8}

The five [khandhas]{.italic} or aggregates, the various parts that make up our empirical personality (see Sutta 22, verse 14), do not constitute a self, either individually or collectively.

[An important and often overlooked aspect of the Buddhist teaching concerns the levels of truth, failure to appreciate which has led to many errors (see n. 220). Very often the Buddha talks in the Suttas in terms of conventional or relative truth (sammuti-or [vohāra-sacca),]{.italic} according to which people and things exist just as they appear to the naive understanding. Elsewhere, however, when addressing an audience capable of appreciating his meaning, he speaks in terms of ultimate truth ([paramattha]{.italic}-[sacca]{.italic}), according to which 'existence is a mere process of physical and mental phenomena within which, or beyond which, no real ego-entity nor any abiding substance can ever be found' ([Buddhist Dictionary]{.italic} under [Paramattha]{.italic}). In the Abhidhamma, the entire exposition is in terms of ultimate truth. It may also be observed that many 'Zen paradoxes' and the like really owe their puzzling character to their being put in terms of ultimate, not of relative truth. The full understanding of ultimate truth can, of course, only be gained by profound insight, but it is possible to become increasingly aware of the distinction. There would seem in fact to be a close parallel in modern times in the difference between our naive world-view and that of the physicist, both points of view having their use in their own sphere. Thus, conventionally speaking, or according to the naive world-view, there are solid objects such as tables and chairs, whereas according to physics the alleged solidity is seen to be an illusion, and whatever might turn out to be the ultimate nature of matter, it is certainly something very different from that which presents itself to our senses. However, when the physicist is off duty, he or she makes use of solid tables and chairs just like everyone else.]{.calibre8}

[In the same way, all such expressions as 'I', 'self' and so on are always in accordance with conventional truth, and the Buddha never hesitated to use the word [attā]{.italic} 'self' (and also with plural meaning: 'yourselves', etc.)[^5^](#The_Long_Dis-_of_the_Buddha_split_126.html_filepos1343626){#The_Long_Dis-_of_the_Buddha_split_019.html_filepos64335 .calibre9} in its conventional and convenient sense.

[In point of fact, it should be stressed that conventional truth is sometimes extremely important. The whole doctrine of karma and rebirth has its validity only in the realm of conventional truth. That is why, by liberating ourselves from the viewpoint of conventional truth we cease to be subject to karmic law. Objections to the idea of rebirth in Buddhism, too, are sometimes based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the two truths. As long as we are unenlightened 'worldlings', our minds habitually operate in terms of 'me' and 'mine', even if in theory we know better. It is not until this tendency has been completely eradicated that full enlightenment can dawn. At Saṁyutta Nikāya 22.89 the Venerable Khemaka, who is a Non-Returner, explains how 'the subtle remnant of the 'I'-conceit, of the 'I'-desire, an unextirpated lurking tendency to think: 'I am", still persists even at that advanced stage.]{.calibre8}

A good act will normally lead to pleasant results for the doer, and a bad act to unpleasant ones.

Thus the development of our 'karma-formations' or behaviour patterns is due to past ignorance (that is, the fact that 'we' are not enlightened). These patterns condition the arising of a new consciousness in the womb, on the basis of which a new psycho-physical complex [(nāma-rūpa)]{.italic} comes into being, equipped with the six sense-bases (of sight, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching, with mind as the sixth sense). Contact of any of these with a sense-object (sight, sound, etc.) produces feeling, which may be pleasant, unpleasant or neutral. On the basis of pleasant feeling, desire or craving arises. The links from consciousness to feeling are the results of past actions [(vipāka),]{.italic} whereas craving, clinging and the process of becoming are volitional (that is, [kamma]{.italic}), and will therefore have results for the future. In fact they set in train the same process of (re)birth (due to ignorance) that we witnessed before, and birth must inevitably lead to death.

Thus, in Sutta 14, we have a set of ten steps instead of the usual twelve, while in Sutta 15, still more remarkably, the six sense-bases are omitted, thus making a total of only nine links. In other parts of the Canon there are occasional expansions beyond the twelve links give here, but this is the standard formula.

[It cannot be the purpose of this book to argue in favour of a belief in rebirth, but sceptics might do well to read [Rebirth as Doctrine and Experience]{.italic} by Francis Story (Buddhist Publication Society 1975), which has an introduction by Ian Stevenson, Carlson Professor of Psychiatry in the University of Virginia. This book contains some case-histories from Thailand and elsewhere which are difficult to explain except on the rebirth hypothesis, and Prof. Stevenson, too, has published several volumes of research-findings of a similar nature from various parts of the world. It may be that the excessive credulity which characterised some previous ages has, in the present time, given way to equally excessive scepticism.]{.calibre8}

[If we even provisionally accept the idea of rebirth, this almost necessarily requires acceptance of some kind of spirit-world or worlds. In the Buddhist scriptures we find a scheme of post-mortem worlds which, while having much in common with general Indian ideas, is in many of its details unique. Here, there are no eternal heavens or hells, though some of both are said to be tremendously long-lasting; but all is in an eternal flux in which worlds and world-systems are born and perish, and living beings are continually born, die and are reborn according to their karmic deserts. It is a grandiose, but ultimately frightening and horrifying vision. Deliverance from it is only possible through the insight engendered by following the path taught by one of the Buddhas who occasionally arise on the scene. For those who fail to gain this insight there can be a happy rebirth for a long time in one of the temporary heaven-worlds, but no permanent deliverance from the perils of birth-and-death. This is [saṁsāra]{.italic} or cyclic existence, the 'on-faring'.]{.calibre8}

Below this are the fourfold 'states of woe': hells, the world of asuras (sometimes rendered 'titans'), of hungry ghosts ([petas]{.italic}), and of animals, while above it are the six lowest heavens. Above these are the sixteen heavens of the World of Form, and above these again the four heavens of the Formless World.]{.calibre8}

There are those today in the West who object strongly to the idea that the Buddha taught that we can be reborn as animals, though at first sight the evidence is all against them. However, since [tiracchāna,]{.italic} normally meaning 'animal', is used in Sutta 1 in the compounds [ttracchāna-kathā, tiracchana-vijjā]{.italic}, meaning 'low talk', 'base art', it is just possible that as a 'destination' for humans [tiracchāna-yoni]{.italic} can be taken as a low rebirth.

Beings in the states below the human are too miserable, fearful and benighted, and those above it are too happy to make the necessary effort. In the human world we encounter both joy and sorrow, often very evenly balanced, and it is also possible to attain to a state of equanimity which is favourable to progress.

Various kinds of non-human beings, not all of whom are beneficent, are supposed to be located in or associated with this realm, and are mentioned in Sutta 20. Since the inhabitants of this sphere (especially the gandhabbas, heavenly musicians and attendants on the kings and their followers) are still addicted to sense-pleasures, it is considered disgraceful for a monk to be reborn there.

Besides the form [deva]{.italic} (which is uncommon in the third sense in the singular), we find the abstract noun [devatā]{.italic} used much like 'deity' in English. It should be noted that though this noun is grammatically feminine, it does not necessarily imply female sex. When it is wished to indicate the sex, the words [devaputta]{.italic} 'deva's son' and [devadhītā]{.italic} 'deva's daughter' may be used, though as most devas are spontaneously reborn this should not be taken literally (however, there are some indications of sexual reproduction occurring in the lowest heavens: we learn from Suttas 20 and 21 that the gandhabba chief Timbaru had a daughter).]{.calibre8}

[It was formerly thought that gandhabbas also presided at conception, but this is due to a misunderstanding of a passage in Majjhima Nikaya 38 where it is stated that a 'gandhabba' must be present in addition to a man and a woman for conception to take place. The word here means, as the commentaries explain, 'being about to be born', that is the new consciousness arising dependent on that of a being who has died.]{.calibre8}

[According to tradition, the text of the Pali Canon was settled at a Council held at Rājagaha immediately after the Teacher's passing, having been memorised by leading Elders, who were highly realised practitioners of the Dhamma. In fact it is clear that the collection as we have it originated over a longer period. The Canon was preserved in oral form until the first century B.C., when it became apparent that the sacred texts might vanish from the earth if they were not recorded in writing. They were accordingly written down under King Vaṭṭagāmanī at this time in Sri Lanka, though some portions may already have been committed to writing earlier. The feat of memory involved in preserving such an extensive body of text orally for so long may seem extraordinary to us, but was quite usual in ancient India. Writing was certainly known in India in the Buddha's time, but was not used for such purposes. It must, however, be remembered that in the course of forty-five years the Buddha preached, doubtless often in a standardised form (see p. 49), to many thousands of people, and that many of the monks and nuns had trained minds and memories, and will have known full well the meaning of what they were repeating.]{.calibre8}

[From about the time of the Second Council, held at Vesali a century after the Buddha's passing, we hear of divisions and the formation of sects within the Order. This led eventually to the rise of the Mahayana schools. An up-to-date account of these developments can be found in A.K. Warder's [Indian Buddhism]{.italic}. Here we need merely note that the Theravada type of Buddhism was carried early to Ceylon, and later to Burma, Thailand and other parts of south-east Asia, whereas the forms of Buddhism that spread to Tibet, China, Japan and other more northerly regions were of the developed, Mahayana type. Portions of the early scriptures of some of the schools that arose have been preserved, either in Sanskrit or, very often, in Chinese and/or Tibetan translations. The Sanskrit of these texts is often very bad, but the attempt was clearly made to lend dignity to the teaching by using the classical language. We thus find that Buddhist terms are found in both Pali and Sanskrit forms, and while the Pali terms are doubtless older, the Sanskrit forms are sometimes better known to the Western reader. Thus Sanskrit [karma]{.italic} is more often used by Westerners than Pali [kamma,]{.italic} Sanskrit [dharma]{.italic} and [nirvāṇa]{.italic} than Pali [dhamma]{.italic} and [nibbāna.]{.italic}]{.calibre8}

[Strictly speaking, the word [Pāḷi]{.italic} means 'text'. But the expression [Pāḷibhāsā,]{.italic} meaning 'language of the texts', was early taken to be the name of the language itself. Its use is practically confined to Buddhist subjects, and then only in the Theravada school. Its exact origins are the subject of learned debate. While we cannot go too deeply into the matter here, it may be said that the traditional equation with the language of the ancient kingdom of Magadha, and the assertion that Pali is, literally and precisely, the language spoken by the Buddha himself, cannot be sustained. All the same, the language the Buddha actually spoke was in all probability not very different from Pali.]{.calibre8}

[From the point of view of the non-specialist, we can think of Pali as a kind of simplified Sanskrit. Its development, like that of other early Indian dialects, can be thought of as similar to an early form of Italian just breaking away from Latin. A close parallel is found in the word for'seven', where Latin [septem]{.italic} has become Italian [sette,]{.italic} the pt being simplified by assimilation to [tt.]{.italic} The Sanskrit equivalent [sapta]{.italic} is in Pali [satta]{.italic}, and similar types of simplification are found in hundreds of words.

[It must be pointed out that [any]{.italic} translator of the Pali Canon is faced with peculiar difficulties, if only owing to the repetitiveness of the originals. Even the manuscripts contain numerous abridgements, and any translator must necessarily abridge a great deal more. I have dealt with repetitions in three ways. Long sections have been condensed into a few lines, which appear in italics and include the Sutta and verse numbers of the omitted passages. Where it is clear from the context what is being omitted I have simply used ellipses; where it is not clear I have used ellipses as well as the Sutta and verse number. In doing so I have ensured that nothing of substance has been omitted. I have made no excisions on account of real or alleged lateness or inauthenticity or the like: such matters are left to the reader's judgement, with an occasional note for guidance. I have as far as possible avoided the use of masculine nouns and pronouns where both sexes are implied. I have, however, always been guided by my understanding of the text, bearing in mind the many admonitions addressed specifically to monks, as well as the words of Brahmins and others who were undoubtedly 'sexist'. I have also kept the masculine gender in a few cases where to do otherwise would have produced intolerable awkwardness or (in verse) spoilt the scansion. I have tried to convey as much as possible the style of the original, rendering it into an English which is, I hope, neither too archaic nor too hypermodern.[^9^](#The_Long_Dis-_of_the_Buddha_split_126.html_filepos1347502){#The_Long_Dis-_of_the_Buddha_split_041.html_filepos111351 .calibre9}]{.calibre8}

[The repetitions in the Canon have probably two distinct sources. It is extremely likely that the Buddha himself developed a standard form for sermons, which he doubtless uttered verbatim, or nearly so, many thousands of times during his forty-five years' ministry. He would seem to have gone on the principle which many teachers use and recommend to this day: 'First tell them what you are going to say, then say it, then tell them what you have said.' His disciples will then have extended this principle into a system of rigidly stereotyped phrases. The second source of repetition will have been inherent in the oral tradition itself, as is witnessed by oral literature all over the world. This is always characterised by long repetitive passages and stereotyped epithets and descriptions. This tendency will in the present instance have been reinforced by the wish to preserve the Master's words as accurately as possible. It should also be remembered that it was not all a mere matter of [mechanical]{.italic} repetition, though this undoubtedly occurred occasionally too.]{.calibre8}

[Certainly, not all parts of the Pali Canon are equally old or can be literally taken to be the Buddha's precise words. This is plain common sense and does not mean completely rejecting their authenticity. Recent research has gone far to vindicate the claim that the Pali Canon holds at least a prime place among our sources in the search for 'original' Buddhism, or, in fact, 'what the Buddha taught'. No attempt can be made here to go into any detail concerning questions of authenticity, or of the chronological stratification of the materials found in the Digha Nikāya.

[An invaluable aid to the understanding of the Pali Canon is provided by the old Commentaries ([Aṭṭhakathā]{.italic})[.]{.italic} These need to be used with caution, and they certainly contain numerous pious fabrications. Without them, however, our understanding of the Suttas would be woefully deficient. The two chief commentaries have been published in Pali by the Pali Text Society. The earliest is called [Sumangalavilāsinī]{.italic} ('Effulgence of the Great Blessing'), but is usually known more prosaically as the Digha Nikāya Commentary ([Dīghanikāy-aṭṭhakathā]{.italic} or DA, 3 volumes, 1886-1932, reprinted 1971). This is by the great Buddhaghosa, who lived in the 5th century C.E. The second, or Sub-Commentary ([ṭīkā]{.italic})[,]{.italic} called [Dīghanikāy-aṭṭhakathā-ṭīkā-Līnatthavaṇṇnanā]{.italic} 'Explanation of Obscurities in the Digha-Nikaya Commentary' or DAT for short (3 vols., ed. Lily de Silva, 1970), is a commentary on the commentary. Extensive extracts from these two commentaries on Suttas 1 and 15 (with further passages from a third, called the 'New Sub-Commentary') are given by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his separate translations of those Suttas, and similar extracts are given by Soma Thera in his version of Sutta 22. Some scanty comments are also quoted (sometimes without translation!) by Rhys Davids at intervals. I have added a few more extracts in my notes where it seemed necessary, besides occasionally clarifying or correcting Rhys Davids's notes.]{.calibre8}

His version is a great improvement on the older one published by the Pali Text Society as [The Path of Purity.]{.italic} It appears that the old commentaries on the Pali Canon, some of which seem to have been very ancient, were translated into Sinhalese and the Pali originals lost, and that Buddhaghosa made from these a new Pali version. In general it is clear that he is recording traditional opinions and interpretations, holding back, except on rare occasions, from expressing a personal opinion with admirable self-effacement. It is to be expected that in due course the major commentaries will be translated into English from their rather difficult late Pali language.]{.calibre8}

Humbled, he returns to Pokkharasati, who is furious at his conduct, hastens to see the Buddha, learns that he does indeed bear the thirty-two marks, and becomes a convert.]{.calibre8}

[4. [Sonadaṇḍa Sutta:]{.italic} About Sonadanda (Qualities of a True Brahmin). The Brahmin Sonadanda of Campa learns of the ascetic Gotama's arrival and goes to see him, against the advice of other Brahmins who think it beneath his dignity. The Buddha asks him about the qualities of a true Brahmin. He mentions five, but at the Buddha's instance admits that these can be reduced to two: wisdom and morality. He becomes a convert but does not experience the 'opening of the Dhamma-eye'.]{.calibre8}

[5. [Kūṭadanta Sutta:]{.italic} About Kūṭadanta (A Bloodless Sacrifice). The Brahmin Kūṭadanta wants to hold a great sacrifice with the slaughter of many hundreds of beasts. He appeals (improbably, as Rhys Davids points out!) to the Buddha for advice on how to do this. The Buddha tells him the story of an ancient king and his Brahmin chaplain, who performed a purely symbolic, bloodless sacrifice. Kūṭadanta sits in silence at the end of this narrative, having realised that the Buddha did not say: 'I have heard this', and the Buddha confirms that it is a story from one of his past lives, thus technically a 'birth-story' ([Jātaka]{.italic}). The Buddha then tells of 'sacrifices more profitable', that is, the higher benefits as in Sutta 2. Kūṭadanta liberates the hundreds of animals he had destined for slaughter, saying: 'Let them be fed with green grass and given cool water to drink, and let cool breezes play upon them'. He becomes a lay-follower, and the 'pure and spotless Dhamma-eye' opens in him.]{.calibre8}

Otthaddha (surnamed Mahali) the Licchavi enquires of the Buddha about why some people cannot hear 'heavenly sounds' and so on, which the Buddha explains as due to their practice of 'one-sided samadhi'. In the latter part, the Buddha tells how two ascetics, Mandissa and Jāliya, had asked him whether the soul, or life principle, is the same as the body, or different (this is one of the 'unanswered questions' mentioned in Sutta 9). The Buddha says anyone who has attained to higher states of understanding will no longer be bothered by such questions.]{.calibre8}

[8. [Mahāsīhanāda Sutta]{.italic}: The Great Lion's Roar is also called 'The Lion's Roar to Kassapa'. The naked ascetic Kassapa asks if it is true that the Buddha condemns all forms of austerity. The Buddha denies this, saying one must distinguish. Kassapa gives a list of standard practices (some of them rather revolting), and the Buddha says one may do any of these things but, if one's morality, heart and wisdom are not developed, one is still far from being an ascetic or a Brahmin (in the true sense). He himself has practised all possible austerities to perfection, and morality and wisdom as well. Kassapa requests ordination, and soon through diligent practice he becomes an Arahant.]{.calibre8}

[9. [Poṭṭhapāda Sutta]{.italic}: About Potthapada (States of Consciousness). The ascetic Potthapada tells the Buddha that he and his fellows have been debating about 'the higher extinction of consciousness', and seeks a ruling on the matter. The Buddha says those who think mental states arise and pass away by chance are quite wrong. He lists the various jhana states, showing how perception can be 'controlled'. Potthapada says he has never heard anything like all this before. The discussion moves to various kinds of possible self, all of which the Buddha refutes, and to the 'unanswered questions' and the reason for their not being answered. Citta, son of an elephant-trainer, joins in the discussion, and finally, while Potthapada becomes a lay-follower, Citta becomes a bhikkhu and soon gains Arahantship. In this Sutta we first find the parable of the man who said he was in love with the most beautiful girl in the country, without knowing who she was or what she looked like.]{.calibre8}

King Ajātasattu, wishing to attack the Vajjians, sends to the Buddha to know what the outcome will be. The Buddha replies indirectly, pointing out the advantages of the Vajjian republican system, and later urges the monks to observe comparable rules for the Sangha. With Ananda, he visits a series of places and gives discourses to monks and laity. At Pāṭaligā̄ma he prophesies the place's future greatness (it became Asoka's capital Pāṭaliputra). At Vesāli the courtesan Ambapā̄li invites him to a meal, and gives her mango-grove to the order. He tells Ananda that he will pass away within three months. At Pā̄vā̄ Cunda the smith serves a meal including 'pig's delight' [(sūkara-maddava)]{.italic} (pork, truffles?-opinions vary) which only the Buddha eats. Later he is taken very ill, but is careful to exonerate Cunda. At Kusinā̄ra the Buddha rests between twin [sā̄l-]{.italic}trees[.]{.italic} Ananda begs him not to pass away in such an insignificant place, but he says it was once a famous capital (see Sutta 17). After giving last instructions to the Sangha (and refusing to appoint a successor), he utters the final admonition 'strive on untiringly' - [appamādena sampādetha --- ]{.italic} and passes away.

It recurs verbatim less verses 18 --- 21, as No 10 in the Majjhima Nikaya. The 'one way' for the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and distress, for the gaining of Nibbāna is the four foundations of mindfulness: mindfulness of body, feelings, mind and mind-objects. Detailed instructions for mindful awareness of breathing, and so on, are given. Thus, under mind-objects, we read, for example: 'If sensual desire is present in himself, a monk knows that it is present. If sensual desire is absent in himself, a monk knows that it is absent. And he knows how unarisen sensual desire comes to arise, and he knows how the abandonment of arisen sensual desire comes about, and he knows how the non-arising of the abandoned sensual desire in the future will come about.'

[\[207\] 1.1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. Once the Lord was touring in the Malla country with a large company of about five hundred monks.

Hearing that the Lord was staying in Cunda's mango-grove, the Mallas of Pāvā went to see him. Having saluted him, they sat down to one side and said: 'Lord, the Mallas of Pāvā have recently erected a new meeting-hall called Ubbhataka, and it has not yet been occupied by any ascetic or Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. \[208\] May the Blessed Lord be the first to use it!

The Pāvā Mallas washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat down along the eastern wall facing west, with the Lord in front of them. Then the Lord spoke to the Mallas on Dhamma till far into the night, instructing, inspiring, firing and delighting them.

Here, the original date of publication is normally given. The sign + after this date means 'reprinted' (sometimes frequently); a date in brackets denotes the latest edition known to me, possibly with a different place of publication. Further, where the author is a Buddhist monk the prefix Ven. is used and the title Thera, etc., omitted after his name.

Lamotte (1958) took 566 -486 B.C. as a working hypothesis, but recently many scholars have argued for a later dating, though with no exact consensus. Perhaps 'ca. 480-400' would be a reasonable guess. Lamotte's dating is not impossible, but the Sri Lankan tradition of 623-543 and other even earlier Oriental datings seem ruled out.]{.calibre8}

[Sutta]{.italic}. There is no satisfactory English translation for this, and 'discourse' is used as a makeshift rendering. It is virtually synonymous with [suttanta,]{.italic} favoured in volumes ii and iii by Rhys Davids and Carpenter. The literal meaning is 'thread', and the Sanskrit form is [sūtra.]{.italic} Typically, a Sutta, which may be all or partly in verse, though prose is the norm, gives a discourse by the Buddha or one of his leading disciples, set within a slight narrative framework and always introduced by the words 'Thus have I heard', having supposedly been thus recited by the Ven. Ananda at the First Council. Mahayana [sūtras]{.italic} are normally much longer and more elaborate.]{.calibre8}

[Hīnayāna]{.italic}. This term, meaning 'lesser vehicle or career', is sometimes used polemically by Mahayana writers for those Buddhists who do not accept their doctrines. Hence it has come in modem times to be applied to the Theravada school, though it was originally applied to a now extinct school called the Sarvastivadins. There is therefore no justification for applying it to the Buddhism of the south-east Asian countries using the Pali Canon.]{.calibre8}

[Sankhdra.]{.italic} The various meanings of this word are well set out in BDic, the most important being that of 'formations' (the Ven. Nyanatiloka's word) in various senses. Here it means 'anything formed or compounded' in the most general sense. In the formula of dependent origination (q.v.) the term is rendered 'Karma-formations', and denotes the karmic patterns, good or bad, produced by past ignorance, which go to shape the character of the new individual. As one of the five groups of aggregates [(khandhas)]{.italic} the [sankhdras]{.italic} are 'mental formations', including some functions that are not karmic.]{.calibre8}

The structure of Pali somewhat resembles that of classical Latin, though with even greater complications and a particular propensity for participial constructions. The problem can be illustrated by a typical example. Sutta 28 opens:]{.calibre8}

Thus in the Pali Canon, Gotama before his enlightenment is referred to as the [Bodhisatta]{.italic}: a term much better known, with some doctrinal development, in its Sanskrit form of [Bodhisattva]{.italic}, 'enlightenment-being'. But it has been suggested that the element [-satta]{.italic} in Pali here stands not for [sattva]{.italic} 'being' but for [sakta]{.italic} 'intent on'. In this case [Bodhisatta]{.italic} would mean 'one intent on enlightenment'. On philological grounds alone, at least, we cannot be sure which explanation is right.]{.calibre8}

Other and probably better editions exist, printed in Sri Lanka, Burma and Thailand. There is even one passage in Sutta 1 where the old translation by Gogerly (1846, reprinted in [Sept Suttas Palis]{.italic} by P. Grimblot, Paris 1876) has a better reading than in the PTS edition.]{.calibre8}

Also, the early translators' technical terms have often been superseded. It must also be said that the Rhys Davids translation, the latter part of which was made by Mrs Rhys Davids, is often careless, with some curious omissions and inconsistencies. That said, tribute must be paid to the pioneering husband and wife team for the vast amount of learning they jointly put into their work. Many of Rhys Davids's introductions to individual Suttas, for instance, are still a joy to read, and many of his interpretations have stood the test of time well --- better indeed than most of those later developed by his wife.]{.calibre8}

Warder, who writes in the preface to vol. iii of the PTC (1963):]{.calibre8}

> [The [Pāḷi,]{.italic} as the only complete recension of the original canon extant, must play the central part in reconstructing such an original \[i.e. 'as rehearsed by the Buddha's followers'\]. The possibility of establishing a substantial amount of such an original Buddhist Canon seems now vouched for by the comparisons made especially by É. Lamotte, in his most valuable [Histoire du Bouddhisme Indien]{.italic} (Vol. I, Louvain, 1958), where the value of the basic Pāḷi texts on Buddhist doctrine --- so often thrust aside in recent years as unauthentic Sinhalese perversions and fabrications probably less faithful to the original doctrine than even the Mahāyāna Sūtras --- is reaffirmed by collation with whatever is available of the other recensions of the so-called 'Hīnayāna' Canon. A variety of methods now lie to hand for ascertaining the original Buddhist doctrine (presumably of the Buddha himself --- who else?): (1) collation of the early canons, (2) collation of the [mātikā]{.italic} \[see n.1012\], (3) the recorded history of the doctrinal peculiarities of the Buddhist schools, (4) comparison and contrast with non-Buddhist schools, (5) chronological distinctions among the texts on grounds of vocabulary and grammatical usages, (6) chronological distinctions among the texts on grounds of metrical usages.]{.calibre8}

This is most valuable for its introduction as well as the translated commentarial material. Beside the Rhys Davids translation (RD) there is also the somewhat abridged version by Mrs A.A.G. Bennett in [Long Discourses of the Buddha]{.italic} (Bombay 1964, Suttas 1-16 only), and that by David Maurice in [The Lion's Roar]{.italic} (London 1962), both of which I have occasionally found useful. I have also consulted the German partial translation (Suttas 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 21, 26, 27) by R.O.

[Khiḍḍapadosikā:]{.italic} these devas and the next group are mentioned only here and in Suttas 20, 24. They illustrate the consequences of desire and aversion even in the (relatively) 'higher' worlds. Moral progress is virtually impossible outside the human state, so that they are actually fortunate to fall back to that state. Mindfulness (sati) is all-important.

And if it were infinite, one living in this world would be able to experience the happiness of the heavenly worlds and the suffering of the hells, etc. If one holds it to be both finite and infinite, one would incur the errors of both the previous positions.

From the commentary, though not the text, we hear that the King finally desisted from his intention. Perhaps the Buddha told the King this story on that occasion, and the incident was later tactfully transferred from the King of Kosala to an imaginary Brahmin 'with royal powers' living in the neighbouring kingdom of Magadha.]{.calibre8}

The same ten questions are found in various parts of the Canon, notably at MN 63 (with the famous analogy of the man wounded by an arrow, who refuses treatment until he has received the answers to a long string of questions) and MN 72 (the fire that went out); and there is a whole section ([saṁyutta]{.italic}) (44) in SN. It has been thought that these questions formed a sort of questionnaire among the 'wanderers' to determine a man's position.

[Nirayaṁ vā tiracchāna-yoniṁ vā]{.italic}. The statement that those who hold 'wrong views' are liable to hell or an animal rebirth is off-putting to modem readers. It is doubtful whether either term originally meant what it was later taken to mean. See Introduction, p. 40f. 'A painful or beast-like rebirth' might express the meaning better. It should be realised, too, that the 'wrong view' referred to means one according to which there are no rewards and punishments for good and evil deeds --- hence no operation of a moral law. This kind of view the Buddha always declared to be particularly reprehensible. Cf. n.801.]{.calibre8}

[The Sutta is a composite one, many portions of which are found separately in other parts of the Canon, as listed by RD. No doubt it contains the basic facts about the Buddha's last days, but various late and more than dubious elements have been incorporated in it-a process which continued in the later Sanskrit versions (produced by the Sarvāstivādins and other schools), which are known to us mainly from the Chinese and Tibetan translations (though some Sanskrit fragments have been found). For E. Waldschmidt's (German) study of these, see A.K. Warder, [Indian Buddhism]{.italic} (2nd ed., Delhi 1980). The Tibetan version is translated into English in W.W. Rockhill, [Life of the Buddha]{.italic} (2nd ed., London 1907), pp. 123-147. It should perhaps be mentioned that the (expanded, Sanskrit-based) [Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]{.italic} is sometimes cited as evidence for the belief in a supreme self in Mahayana Buddhism. One Chinese version does indeed contain a passage to this effect, but this is a late interpolation, and is not representative of the general Mahayana position.]{.calibre8}

[Kappaṁ vā tiṭṭheyya kappâvasesaṁ vā.]{.italic} This passage is much disputed. The usual meaning of [kappa]{.italic} is 'aeon' (but see PED for other senses). DA, however, takes it to mean 'the full life-span' (i.e. in Gotama's day, 100 years: cf. DN 14.1.7). DA also takes [avasesa]{.italic} to mean 'in excess' (the usual meaning being 'the remainder'). After some hesitation, and preferring the lesser 'miracle', I have translated the sense of [kappa]{.italic} (as I take it) by 'a century'. This, of course, accords with DA. I have, however, adopted the usual meaning of avasesa as making good sense. For the Buddha, the 'remainder' would have been twenty years. PTS translators of the parallel passages have differed in their interpretations. Whereas RD in DN preferred 'aeon', Woodward at SN 51.10 (followed reluctantly by Hare at AN 8.70!) has 'allotted span', and at Ud 6.1 he tersely remarks: 'Supposed by some to mean "the aeon or world-period"'. It may be noted that LDB has 'world-period', while Mrs Bennett discreetly omits the passage.]{.calibre8}

It could therefore mean either 'the tender parts of a pig' or 'what pigs enjoy' (cf. note 46 in LDB). What is quite clear is that the old commentators did not know for certain what it did mean. DA gives three possibilities: 1. The flesh of a wild pig, neither too young nor too old, which had come to hand without being killed, 2. soft boiled rice cooked with 'the five products of the cow', or 3. a kind of elixir of life [(rasāyana)]{.italic} (cf. next note). Modem interpreters from RD onwards have favoured truffles as a plausible explanation, and some evidence for this has been adduced. Trevor Ling, in n.31 to his revision of the RD translation of this Sutta ([The Buddhaʹs Philosophy of Man]{.italic} (Everyman's Library, London 1981, p. 218), remarks: 'This explanation seems intended to avoid offence to vegetarian readers or hearers. Rhys Davids's statement that Buddhists "have been mostly vegetarians, and are increasingly so", is difficult to accept.' Be that as it may (and in fact Eastern Theravada Buddhists have rarely been vegetarians, though some are now, almost certainly under Western influence!), the question of vegetarianism has frequently been raised in the Buddhist field.]{.calibre8}

::: calibre39
[The standard Theravada position is set out in the Jivaka Sutta (MN 55), in which the Buddha tells Jivaka that monks must not eat the meat of any animal concerning which they have seen, heard or suspect that it was specially killed for them. The Buddha rejected Devadatta's proposal to forbid meat-eating altogether to the monks. Living on alms as they did in the conditions of rural India at the time, they would either have gravely embarrassed those who offered them food, or starved if they had refused all meat. At the same time, under modem conditions, especially in the West, the question does arise as to whether the Sangha might not educate the laity into offering only vegetarian food. Many Western Buddhists (and not only Mahayanists) are in fact vegetarians today.]{.calibre8}

[In many schools of Mahayana Buddhism, vegetarianism is the rule, and some writers have indulged in polemics against the Theravada school on this score. This, whatever may be said, has not always been purely for reasons of compassion. Shinran Shōnin, the founder of the Shin School in Japan, abolished compulsory vegetarianism along with celibacy because he considered it a form of penitential practice.]{.calibre8}

Lamotte, [The Teaching of Vimalakīrti]{.italic} (Engl. transl., PTS, London 1976), p. 313f., has an interesting and learned note in which he refers to deities mentioned in MN 36, who offered to insert a special divine essence into the Bodhisatta's pores to keep him alive, at the time of his extreme austerities. He compares the Buddha's last meal with the wondrous food served to the Bodhisattvas by Vimalakirti, which takes seven days to digest, whereas the [sūkara-maddava]{.italic} eaten by the Buddha can only be digested by the Tathagata (or so we are told). The trouble was, of course, that in fact even the Tathagata failed to digest it! Cf. also SN 7-1.9.]{.calibre8}

[vayadhammā sankhārā. Appamādena sampādetha.]{.italic} The words occurred previously at DN 16.3.51. RD's rendering of the latter two words, 'Work out your salvation with diligence' (adopted from Warren) has become too famous. Even Brewster, who normally follows RD, has changed it to 'Accomplish earnestly!', which is much better. Much has been made in some quarters of the fact that the Sarvastivadin version (and therefore the Tibetan translation) omits these words. But the passage is even expanded in one Chinese version, which makes dubious any conclusions which may be drawn from the omission elsewhere. However, there does seem to have been an early corruption in the text, as in the parallel passage at SN 6.2.5.2 the order of the two sentences is reversed: [appamādena sampādetha vayadhammā sankhādrā]{.italic} (= S i, 158). The inference is that the words quoted were lost at an early stage in the Sarvastivadin tradition. The SN passage probably reflects an intermediate stage in that process.]{.calibre8}

He stresses the humour and the propagandist technique employed, which consists in accepting and then outflanking the opponents' position rather than direct confrontation. While we may not be convinced that this Sutta goes back to the Buddha personally (but equally --- are we sure that it does not, in some form?), this is indeed the method he uses in discussions with a variety of interlocutors. RD also analyses the differences between this Sutta and the version in the Sanskrit [Mahāvastu,]{.italic} a product of the Lokuttaravāda school.]{.calibre8}

It recurs verbatim at MN 10 as the Satipatthana Sutta, with the omission of verses 18-21. The text (or that of MN 10) has been separately translated a number of times, notably by Soma Thera as [The Way of Mindfulness]{.italic} (2nd ed. Colombo 1949, 3rd ed. BPS 1967). The important book [The Heart of Buddhist Meditation]{.italic} by Nyāṇaponika Mahāthera (Colombo 1954, London 1973 and later) is essentially based on this Sutta and contains a translation, not only of this but of other relevant texts from the Pali Canon and from Mahayana sources (especially Santideva's [Sikṣāsamuccaya).]{.italic} The author's remark in the Introduction (p. 14) should also be noted: 'Among the Mahayana schools of the Far East, it is chiefly the Chinese Ch'an and Japanese Zen that are closest to the spirit of Satipaṭṭhāna. Notwithstanding the differences in method, aim and basic philosophical conceptions, the connecting links with Satipaṭṭhāna are close and strong, and it is regrettable that they have hardly been stressed or noticed.' It should however be mentioned that since those words were written, the realisation has begun to dawn that Zen has much in common with Theravāda in general, and the Satipaṭṭhāna method in particular --- somewhat to the surprise of some who have overstressed the 'uniqueness' of Zen. The cross-headings in this Sutta correspond closely to those used by the Ven. Ñāṇamoli for MN 10.]{.calibre8}

[Vibhava-taṇhā. Vibhava]{.italic} means (1) 'power, success, wealth', and some translators have wrongly taken this meaning here; (2) 'ceasing to become' i.e. extinction. This is undoubtedly the meaning here. But the [vibhava]{.italic} meant in this sense is not the higher 'cessation' of Nibbāna, but the materialists' 'extinction' at death (cf. the Freudian 'death-wish').]{.calibre8}

Not only is the main part inferior and contradictory, if humorous, but it concludes, first with an appendix (2.14ff.) on the beginning of things which is clumsily tacked on, doubtless in response to Sunakkhatta's remarks at 1.5 (which were adequately answered [there]{.italic}), and then (2.21) with an even more irrelevant appendix to that appendix. Another curious feature is that it is probably the only Sutta in the Canon which consists almost entirely of a narrative (as opposed to a discourse) related by the Buddha to a third party (and, at that, an obscure character not owing him any allegiance).]{.calibre8}

Clearly this immense period --- which, in regard to the human life-span, is not canonical --- is not meant here, but the reference to 'ten years' is relevant.

This, and a parallel passage at AN 3.56, is the only passage in the first four Nikāyas where it is mentioned, and 'hell' does not seem to be its meaning (RD renders it 'the Waveless Deep'), though its exact sense is doubtful. Warder, in his paraphrase of this Sutta ([Indian Buddhism]{.italic}, 168) says parenthetically: '"like purgatory", the Buddha remarks ambiguously, thinking probably of his preference for seclusion.' The Buddhist hells grow steadily worse in the popular imagination, but most of their horrors find little support in the Suttas (though see MN 129, 130). Cf. n.244 and Introduction, p. 40.]{.calibre8}

Yet, properly considered, it has its interest, first, as an example of the forms Buddhist propaganda was perhaps sometimes obliged to assume, and also from the point of view of iconography, as some of the marks came to be depicted in images of the Buddha: the great reclining Buddha-figure in Wat Pho in Bangkok is a well-known example. RD has a wide-ranging introduction tracing the possible origins of such marks, which clearly must have been important in the minds of influential Brahmins in the time of the Buddha (see, e.g. DN 3). However, later Brahmin tradition has preserved very little about them. Certainly, many of them seem quite arbitrary and even difficult to distinguish clearly. Nevertheless, there are more traces of their influence in later Buddhist writing (and, as observed, iconography) than RD is anxious to admit, and there are even 'eighty minor marks' mentioned in addition to the thirty-two major ones here listed. Both lists, major and minor, are found in the [Dharma-Samigraha]{.italic} (ed. Kenjiu Kasawara and F. Max Müller, 1885, rep. Delhi 1981), carefully collated with the lists as they occur in the present Sutta and elsewhere. RD remarks that 'most of the marks are so absurd, considered as marks of any human, that they are probably mythological in origin, and three or four seem to be solar.' He adds that 'our Suttanta seems gravely ironical in the contrast it makes between the absurdity of the marks and the beauty of the ethical qualities they are supposed, in the Suttanta, to mean.' But it must be added that, however absurdly as regards the details, they are intended to show the relation between action and karmic result, and they could have been used pedagogically to inculcate this lesson. Scholars are agreed on the fairly obvious fact that this is one of the latest texts in the Nikaya, and this is even hinted at in the commentary itself. The verses, ascribed to Ananda, show an exceptionally wide variety of metres, but all of late types. It is possible that someone tried to give this unpromising material some literary grace by dexterous versification. I considered trying to reproduce the different metrical forms in translation, but decided this was beyond my powers. Perhaps some other translator will attempt this one day.]{.calibre8}

The purist may be shocked to find this not only in 'popular Buddhism' but actually enshrined in the Canon; but Mrs Rhys Davids offers a spirited defence of such things in the introduction to her translation of this Sutta. She quotes the list of canonical [parittas,]{.italic} and a similar list also occurs at VM 13.31: the Ratana Sutta (Sn 222ff., Khp 6), Khandha Paritta (AN 4.67), Dhajagga Paritta (SN 11.1.3), and Mora Paritta (Ja 159), beside the present Sutta. These are said to be efficacious through ten thousand million world-systems. DA, however, advises the use of the Metta Sutta in the first place, then the Dhajagga and Ratana Suttas. Only if, after a week, these do not work, should the Ātānātiya be resorted to --- which would be of no use in the kind of emergency envisaged in the text! But the mention of the Metta Sutta is interesting because the Khandha Sutta (delivered after a monk had died of a snake-bite) enjoins the practice of loving-kindness to all beings as a form of self-protection. Like certain truthful declarations, this can have powerful effects. See Piyadassi Thera, [The Book of Protection]{.italic} (BPS 1975).]{.calibre8}

[A Tibetan version of this Sutta exists, and a fragment of a Sanskrit version has been found in Central Asia, but this differs considerably from the Pali. It is quoted with translation by K. Saha, [Buddhism in Central Asia]{.italic} (Calcutta 1970), 47-49. This includes a reference to ′Ātānati the much renowned', and 'the heart of Ātānāti furthering all acts \...′ as if this were a person, though according to our text and DA, Ātānātā is a town.]{.calibre8}
:::

::: calibre39
[This Sutta is much used on special occasions in the countries of Theravāda Buddhism. Thus in Thailand it is chanted at the New Year, together with the Mahāsamaya Sutta (DN 20, with which it has much in common) and the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (SN 56.12.2, the Buddha's first sermon). The Thai version also includes a non-canonical introductory portion containing verses of homage to twenty-one Buddhas earlier than Vipassi, going right back to Dipankara, under whom the future Buddha Gotama first went forth, and to three even earlier Buddhas before him. See also K.R. Norman, [Pali Literature]{.italic} (Wiesbaden 1983), 173ff.]{.calibre8}

RD with characteristic caution says of this and DN 34: 'They contain here and there matter which suggests that they took their present shape at a later date than the bulk of the rest of the Digha'. It is associated, like DN 29, with the time immediately following the death of the Nigantha Nātaputta, the Jain leader, and it is located 'in the mango-grove of Cunda the smith', known to us from DN 16.4.14ff. If we compare DN 29, we find that that discourse is addressed to 'the novice Cunda', who is quite a different character --- but we may wonder whether the two have not become confused. Part of the inspiration of DN 34 may have come from the Buddha's words at DN 29.17. Could the whole Sutta have been expanded from that nucleus? In any case the method of listing items in expanding numerical groups was used (whether earlier or later) on a large scale in the Anguttara Nikaya, and in fact quite a number of entries in the lists in this Sutta appear there too.]{.calibre8}

::: calibre39
[Such numerical listing has also been compared by different writers from RD onwards to the so-called 'matrices' [(mātikā)]{.italic} of the Abhidhamma --- partly with the implication that this type of presentation always represents a stratum considerably later than the Buddha's time. In fact we do not know to what extent the Buddha himself resorted to the obvious pedagogic device of teaching 'by numbers'. In any case, when such numerical lists were in existence, they readily lent themselves to expansion, and it is likely that the material of this Sutta dates from a variety of periods, and because some of it is obviously late, this does not mean that other parts are not early. There are in existence Tibetan and other versions. It should perhaps be stressed that, arid as this type of Sutta may appear to many today, it is from the monastic point of view valuable for use in chanting (its ostensible - and probably real --- original object), incorporating as it does not only the major doctrinal categories in brief, but many points on behaviour and discipline which monks should constantly bear in mind.]{.calibre8}
