This is a translation of the Tibetan text of *Mūlamadhyamakakārik*ā. It
is perhaps an odd idea to translate a Tibetan translation of a Sanskrit
text and to retranslate a text of which there are four extant English
versions. My reasons for doing so are these: First, I am not satisfied
with any of the other[]{#calibre_link-824} English versions. Every
translation, this one included, of any text embodies an interpretation,
and my interpretation differs in various respects from those of my
predecessors in this endeavor. This is to be expected. As Tuck (1990)
has correctly observed, Nāgārjuna, like any philosopher from a distant
cultural context, is always read[]{#calibre_link-825} against an
interpretive backdrop provided by the philosophical presuppositions of
the interpreter, and by previous readings of Nāgārjuna. So I claim no
special privileged position vis à vis Streng (1967), Inada (1970),
Sprung (1979), or Kalupahana (1986)---only a different position, one
that I hope will prove useful in bringing
*Mū[]{#calibre_link-826}lamadhyamakakārik*ā into contemporary
philosophical discourse. I, like any translator/interpreter must
acknowledge that there is simply no fact of the matter about the correct
rendering of any important and genuinely interesting text.
Interpretations, and with them, translations, will continue to evolve as
our understanding of the text[]{#calibre_link-827} evolves and as our
interpretive horizon changes. Matters are even more complex and
indeterminate when the translation crosses centuries, traditions and
languages, and sets of philosophical assumptions that are quite distant
from one another, as is the case in the present project. So each of the
available versions of the text embodies a reading. Inada reads
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-828}rjuna from the standpoint of
[]{#calibre_link-829}the Zen tradition, and his translation reflects
that reading; Kalupahana reads Nāgārjuna as a Theravada commentator on
the *Kaccāyānagotta-sūtra,* and his translation reflects that reading,
as well as his view about the affinities[]{#calibre_link-830} between
James's pragmatism and Theravada Buddhism. Sprung adopts Murti's Kantian
interpretation of Mādhyamika, and his translation reflects that
interpretation. Streng reads the text as primarily concerned with
religious phenomenology. There is no translation of this text into
English, and no commentary on it, that specifically reflects an
Indo-Tibetan Prā[]{#calibre_link-831}saṅgika-Mādhyamika interpretation.
Inasmuch as this is my own preferred way to read Nāgārjuna, and the
reading dominant in Tibetan and highly influential in Japanese and
Chinese discussions of *Mūlamadhyamakak*ā*rikā[]{#calibre_link-832},* I
believe that it is important to fill this lacuna in the English
bibliography.

Having argued that all translation involves some interpretation and,
hence, that there is always some distance between an original text and a
translation, however good and canonical that translation may be, it
follows that *Mūlamadhyamakakàrikā* and *dBu-ma
rtsaba[]{#calibre_link-833} shes-rab* differ, however close they may be
and however canonically the latter is treated. Since *dBu-ma rtsa-ba
shes-rab* is the text read by and commented on by generations of Tibetan
philosophers, I think that it is important that an English translation
of this very text be available to the Western philosophical public. This
text is hence worthy in its own right of translation inasmuch as it
is[]{#calibre_link-834} the proper subject of the Tibetan philosophical
literature I and others find so deep and fascinating.

This is not a critical scholarly edition of the text. It is not
philological in intent; nor is it a discussion of the commentarial
literature on Nāgārjuna's text. There is indeed a need for such a book,
but that need will have to be[]{#calibre_link-835} filled by someone
else. This is rather meant to be a presentation of a philosophical text
to philosophers, and not an edition of the text for Buddhologists. If
philosophers and students who read my book thereby gain an entrance into
Nāgārjuna's philosophy and see
*Mūlamadhyamakakārikā[]{#calibre_link-836},* as interpreted herein, as a
text worthy of study and discussion, this work will have served its
purpose. Since my intended audience is not Buddhologists, per se, but
Western philosophers who are interested in Buddhist philosophy, I have
tried to balance standard []{#calibre_link-837}renderings of Buddhist
terminology with more perspicuous contemporary philosophical language. I
am not sure that I have always made[]{#calibre_link-838} the right
decisions or that I have found the middle path between the extremes of
Buddhological orthodoxy and Western revisionism. But that is the aim.

I am also striving for that elusive middle path between two other
extremes in translation: I am trying on the one hand to avoid the
unreadable literalism of translations that strive to provide a verbatim
report of the words used the original, regardless[]{#calibre_link-839}
of whether that results in a comprehensible English text. But there is
on the other hand the extreme represented by a translation written in
lucid English prose purporting to be what the original author *would*
have written had he been a twentieth-century philosopher writing in
English, or one that, in an attempt to convey what the text *really
means* on some particular interpretation, is in
fact[]{#calibre_link-840} not a translation of the original text, but a
completely new book, bearing only a distant relation to the original.
This hopelessly mixes the tasks of translation on the one hand and
critical commentary on the other. Of course, as I have noted above,
these tasks are intertwined. But there is the fault of allowing the
translation to become *so* mixed with the commentary that one no longer
has a grip[]{#calibre_link-841} on, for example, what is Nāgārjuna and
what is Garfield. After all, although the text is interpreted in being
translated, this text should still come out in translation as a text
which *could* be interpreted in the ways that others have read it.
Because the original *does* indeed justify competing interpretations.
That is one of the things[]{#calibre_link-842} that makes it such an
important philosophical work.

Thanks are already due to many who have helped at different stages of
this project: Thanks to Bob Thurman and David Sloss for first
introducing me to Buddhist philosophy and then for encouraging me to
wade deeper. Thanks to David Kalupahana, Steve Odin, Kenneth Inada, and
Guy Newland, as well as to David Karnos, Joel Aubel, Dick Garner, and
William Herbrechtsmeier for many hours[]{#calibre_link-848} of valuable
and enjoyable discussion of this text at the National Endowment for the
Humanities Summer institute on Nāgārjuna in Hawaii. And thanks to the
NEH for the grant support that enabled my participation in that
institute. I am especially grateful to Guy Newland for many subsequent
conversations, useful suggestions, encouragement,[]{#calibre_link-849}
and a critical reading of my work. Thanks to Janet Gyatso for countless
hours of profitable and enjoyable philosophical conversation and for
many useful and detailed criticisms and suggestions on this and other
related work. Thanks to the Ven. Geshe Lobzang Tsetan for starting me in
Tibetan, for much useful philosophical interchange, for teaching me an
immense amount about Mā[]{#calibre_link-850}dhyamika, and for his close
criticism of this text; to Georges Dreyfus (Geshe Sengye Samdup) for
much useful advice and discussion; and to Joshua and Dianne Cutler and
the Tibetan Buddhist Learning Center of North America for hospitality. I
also thank John Dunne for detailed comments on several chapters of an
earlier draft of this translation.

I am grateful to the Indo-American Foundation, the[]{#calibre_link-851}
Council for the International Exchange of Scholars, and the Smithsonian
Institution for an Indo-American Fellowship in 1990-91. During that
[]{#calibre_link-852}time, as a Visiting Senior Research Scholar at the
Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, I began work on this
project. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to The Most Ven. Prof.
Samdhong Rinpoche and his staff for hosting me and my family at the
Central[]{#calibre_link-853} Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies and to
Rinpoche himself for his generous personal help. I thank the Ven. Geshe
Ngawang Sherab for all of his kind logistical help at Santarakshita
Library and for friendship and philosophical interchange. Thanks also to
the Ven. Lobzang Norbu Shastri and the Ven. Acarya Ngawang Samten for
extensive conversations from which I learned much and for useful
comments[]{#calibre_link-854} on this work and to Karma for Tibetan
lessons.

I am deeply grateful to the Ven. Prof. Geshe Yeshes Thap-Khas for
reading *dBu-ma rtsa-ba shes-rab* and related texts with me and for
giving me his invaluable oral commentary on these texts during that year
and on many subsequent occasions. Nobody has taught me more about
Mādhyamika philosophy, and it is hard to imagine[]{#calibre_link-855} a
more patient, generous, and incisive scholar and teacher. Without his
lucid teachings, and without Geshe-la's enormous patience, I could never
have approached this text with any degree of success. While he would not
agree with everything I say, my own reading of this text is enormously
influenced by his. Special thanks to Sri Yeshi Tashi Shastri for his
translation and transcription assistance[]{#calibre_link-856} during
many of these sessions and for an enormous amount of cheerful and
generous general research assistance, including a great deal of careful
proofreading and detailed comments on this translation.

During that year and in subsequent years I also benefited greatly from
my visits to the Institute of Buddhist Dialectics. I am deeply grateful
to the Ven. Prof. Geshe Lobzang Gyatso for his
hospitality[]{#calibre_link-857} and for his teaching. In our many
conversations and from his writings I have learned a great deal, and
this project certainly reflects his influence. Without his patient
advice on interpretative and expository details and without his vigorous
critique of many of my ideas it would have been impossible to produce
this commentary. I thank the Ven. Sherab Gyatso for his tireless and
invaluable[]{#calibre_link-858} translation and assistance during that
time. The Ven. Sherab Gyasto, The Ven. Graham Woodhouse, the Ven. Tenzin
Dechen, and the Ven. Huen have given much to me in many hours of
philosophical interchange through translation help and through their
hospitality []{#calibre_link-859}and friendship. Mr. Phillipe Goldin has
also offered many helpful suggestions on the translation and commentary.
I also thank the Ven. Khamtrul[]{#calibre_link-860} Rinpoche, the Ven.
Geshe Yeshe Topden (Gen Drup-Thop) and Gen Lam-Rim-pa for their
teachings and Acarya Nyima Tshering for his introduction and translation
on those occasions. Special thanks to Nyima Penthog for improving my
Tibetan.

I thank His Holiness the Dalai Lama for his encouragement and for
valuable discussion of some difficult interpretative issues.

I am also very grateful to friends[]{#calibre_link-861} and colleagues
at Drepung Loseling Monastic College. My visit there was extremely
enjoyable and also philosophically fruitful. Thanks to the Ven. Geshe
Dak-pa Toepgyal and the Ven. Thupten Dorjee for arranging everything and
for talking with me about this and other work. I am very grateful to the
Ven. Geshe Namgyal Wangchen for detailed comments and encouragement on
this work and for useful discussions[]{#calibre_link-862} about
Mādhyamika, translation, the task of presenting Buddhist philosophical
texts to the West, and other topics.

My acknowledgment of help in India would not be complete without
acknowledging the gracious hospitality and assistance in living of Sri
N. N. Rai, Sri Arun Kumar Rai, Sri A. R. Singh, and their families in
Sarnath; the hospitality of Kunzom Topden Martam[]{#calibre_link-863}
and his family in Sikkim---it was the Martam house in which the writing
actually got started; and Dr. L. S. Suri of the American Institute of
Indian Studies in New Delhi, whose administrative efficiency kept
everything moving smoothly.

I am deeply grateful to four friends who read a complete draft of this
work and provided honest, searching, sometimes scathing criticism. What
more could one ask[]{#calibre_link-864} from colleagues and friends?
Many of their suggestions are incorporated in the book as it now stands,
and much of whatever is good in it is due to their enormous
contributions. Sometimes I have disagreed with each of them. And
whatever errors remain are certainly my own. So thanks especially to the
Ven. Gareth Sparham, the Ven. Sherab Gyatso, Guy Newland, and Jane
Braaten for copious corrections[]{#calibre_link-865} and criticism and
for extensive productive discussion. Thanks also to Prof. Alan Sponberg
for useful comments on an earlier draft and to Janet Gyatso, Graham
Parkes, and Georges Dreyfus for reading and commenting on the
penultimate draft.

[]{#calibre_link-866}Another group of colleagues to whom I owe thanks
are those who kept faith. This may require some explanation. I
discovered when I---a Western, analytically trained[]{#calibre_link-867}
philosopher of mind---began to work on Buddhist philosophy that many in
philosophy and cognitive science took this as evidence of some kind of
insanity, or at least as an abandonment of philosophy, per se. This is
not the place to speculate on the origins or nature of the stigma
attaching in some parts of our profession to Asian philosophy. But it is
a sad fact to be noted and to be rectified.[]{#calibre_link-868} In any
case, I therefore owe special thanks to those who went out of their way
to support this work and to let me know that they took it and me
seriously. I thank especially my friend and colleague Meredith Michaels
for constant support, advice, and encouragement. And I thank Murray
Kiteley, John Connolly, Nalini Bhushan, Kathryn Addelson, Elizabeth
Spellman, Frederique Marglin, Lee Bowie, Tom
Warten-burg,[]{#calibre_link-869} Vere Chappell, Gareth Matthews, and
John Robison, as well as Dan Lloyd, Steve Horst, and Joe Rouse. Thanks
under this head also go to many of my nonphilosopher colleagues in the
Hampshire College Cultural Studies program. I single out Mary Russo,
Joan Landes, Susan Douglas, Jeffery Wallen, Norman Holland, and L. Brown
Kennedy.

I also gratefully acknowledge the support of several
Hewlett-Mellon[]{#calibre_link-870} faculty development grants from
Hampshire College and thank the deans of the college for supporting this
work so generously. I am also grateful for the support of this project
and of related projects involving academic exchange between the American
and Tibetan academic communities from President Greg Prince of Hampshire
College. Thanks also to Ms. Ruth Hammen and Ms. Leni Bowen for regular
logistical[]{#calibre_link-871} support, to Mr. Andrew Janiak for his
extensive assistance and editorial suggestions in the final stages of
manuscript preparation, and to Mr. Shua Garfield and Mr. Jeremy Mage for
additional assistance in manuscript preparation and proofreading. Thanks
as well to many groups of students in "Convention, Knowledge and
Existence: European and Indo-Tibetan Perspectives" for putting up with
and[]{#calibre_link-872} helping me to refine my presentation of this
text and for my students in Buddhist Philosophy at Mount Holyoke College
for working through an earlier draft of this text.

[]{#calibre_link-873}Portions of the translations of and commentaries on
Chapters I, II, XIII, and XXIV appeared in *Philosophy East and West* in
Garfield (1990) and (1994). I thank the editors for permission to use
that material here. The Tibetan edition[]{#calibre_link-874} of the text
is from dGe 'dun grub, *dBu ma rtsa shes rtsa 'grel bzhugs* (Commentary
on *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā)*, Ge Lugs Pa Students' Welfare Publishing,
Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies, Sarnath, 1987.

I am more grateful than I could ever express to my family for
accompanying me to India for one year, for[]{#calibre_link-875} enduring
my absence when I have been in India alone, and for enduring my
preoccupation with this and related philosophical projects. I am
especially grateful to Blaine Garson, who has shouldered far more than
her fair share of parenting and other household responsibilities. Every
stage of this project is dependent upon her help, sacrifice, and
support.

I hope that I haven't forgotten anybody.[]{#calibre_link-876}

1\. Neither from itself nor from another,

Nor from both,

Nor without a cause,

Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.

2\. There are four conditions: efficient condition;

Percept-object condition; immediate condition;

Dominant condition, just so.

There is no fifth condition.

3\. The essence of entities

Is not present in the conditions, etc ....

If there[]{#calibre_link-895} is no essence,

There can be no otherness-essence.

4\. Power to act does not have conditions.

There is no power to act without conditions.

There are no conditions without power to act.

Nor do any have the power to act.

5\. These give rise to those,

So these are called conditions.

As long as those do not come from these.

Why are these not non-conditions?

[]{#calibre_link-527}6. For neither an existent nor
a[]{#calibre_link-896} non-existent thing

Is a condition appropriate.

If a thing is non-existent, how could it have a condition?

If a thing is already existent, what would a condition do?

7\. When neither existents nor

Non-existents nor existent non-existents are established,

How could one propose a "productive cause?"

If there were one, it would be pointless.

8\. An existent entity (mental episode)

Has no object.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-897}
:::

Since a mental episode is without an object,

How could there be any percept-condition?

9\. Since things are not arisen.

Cessation is not acceptable.

Therefore, an immediate condition is not reasonable.

If something has ceased, how could it be a condition?

10\. If things did not exist

Without essence,

The phrase, "When this exists so this will be,"

Would not be acceptable.

11\. In the several[]{#calibre_link-898} or united conditions

The effect cannot be found.

How could something not in the conditions

Come from the conditions?

12\. However, if a nonexistent effect

Arises from these conditions,

Why does it not arise

From non-conditions?

[]{#calibre_link-506}13. If the effect's essence is the conditions,

But the conditions don't have their own essence,

How could an effect whose essence is the conditions

Come from[]{#calibre_link-899} something that is essenceless?

14\. Therefore, neither with conditions as their essence,

Nor with non-conditions as their essence are there any effects.

If there are no such effects,

How could conditions or non-conditions be evident?

1\. What has been moved is not moving.

What has not been moved is not moving.

Apart from what has been moved and what has not been moved,

Movement cannot be conceived.

2\. Where there is change, there is motion.

Since there is change in the moving,

And not in the moved or not-moved,

Motion is in that which is moving.

3\. How would it be acceptable

For motion[]{#calibre_link-903} to be in the mover?

When it is not moving, it is not acceptable

To call it a mover.

4\. For whomever there is motion in the mover,

There could be non-motion

Evident in the mover.

But having motion follows from being a mover.

5\. If motion is in the mover.

There would have to be a twofold motion:

[]{#calibre_link-534}One in virtue of which it is a mover,

And one in virtue of which it moves.

6\. If there were[]{#calibre_link-904} a twofold motion.

The subject of that motion would be twofold.

For without a subject of motion,

There cannot be motion.

7\. If without a mover

It would not be correct to say that there is motion,

Then if there were no motion,

How could there be a mover?

8\. Inasmuch as a real mover does not move,

And a non-mover does not move,

Apart from a mover and a non-mover,

What third thing could[]{#calibre_link-905} move?

9\. When without motion,

It is unacceptable to call something a mover,

How will it be acceptable

To say that a mover moves?

10\. For him from whose perspective a mover moves,

There would be the consequence that

Without motion there could be a mover.

Because a mover moves.

11\. If a mover were to move,

There would be a twofold motion:

One in virtue of which he is a mover,

And one[]{#calibre_link-906} in virtue of which the mover moves.

12\. Motion does not begin in what has moved,

Nor does it begin in what has not moved.

Nor does it begin in what is moving.

In what, then, does motion begin?

[]{#calibre_link-327}13. Prior to the beginning of motion,

There is no beginning of motion in

The going or in the gone.

How could there be motion in the not-gone?

14\. Since the beginning of motion

Cannot be conceived[]{#calibre_link-907} in any way.

What gone thing, what going thing,

And what non-going thing can be posited?

15\. Just as a moving thing is not stationary,

A non-moving thing is not stationary.

Apart from the moving and the non-moving,

What third thing is stationary?

16\. If without motion

It is not appropriate to posit a mover,

How could it be appropriate to say

That a moving thing is stationary?

17\. One[]{#calibre_link-908} does not halt from moving,

Nor from having moved or not having moved.

Motion and coming to rest

And starting to move are similar.

18\. That motion just is the mover itself

Is not correct.

Nor is it correct that

They are completely different.

19\. It would follow from

The identity of mover and motion

That agent and action

Are identical.

20\. It would follow from

A real distinction between[]{#calibre_link-909} motion and mover

That there could be a mover without motion

And motion without a mover.

[]{#calibre_link-472}21. When neither in identity

Nor in difference

Can they be established,

How can these two be established at all?

22\. The motion by means of which a mover is manifest

Cannot be the motion by means of which he moves.

He does not exist before that motion,

So what and where is the thing that moves?

[]{#calibre_link-910}23. A mover does not carry out a different motion

From that by means of which he is manifest as a mover.

Moreover, in one mover

A twofold motion is unacceptable.

24\. A really existent mover

Doesn't move in any of the three ways.

A non-existent mover

Doesn't move in any of the three ways.

25\. Neither an entity nor a non-entity

Moves in any of the three ways.

So motion, mover and

And route[]{#calibre_link-911} are non-existent.

Their spheres are the visible objects, etc....

2\. That very seeing does not see

Itself at all.

How can something that cannot see itself

See another?

3\. The example of fire

Cannot elucidate seeing.

Along with the moved and not-moved and motion

That has been answered.

4\. When there is not even the slightest

Nonseeing seer,

How could it makes sense to say

That seeing sees?

5\. Seeing itself does not see.

Nonseeing itself does not see.

Through seeing itself

The clear analysis of the seer is understood.

[]{#calibre_link-379}6. Without detachment from vision there is no seer.

Nor is there a seer detached from it.

If there is no seer

How can there be seeing or the seen?

[]{#calibre_link-915}7. Just as the birth of a son is said to occur

In dependence on the mother and father,

So consciousness is said to arise

In dependence on the eye and material form.

8\. From the nonexistence of seeing and the seen it follows that

The other four faculties of knowledge do not exist.

And all the aggregates, etc.,

Are the same way.

Form cannot be conceived.

Apart from form,

The cause of form is not seen.

2\. If apart from the cause of form, there were form,

Form would be without cause.

But nowhere is there an effect

Without a cause.

3\. If apart from form

There were a cause of form,

It would be a cause without an effect.

But there are no[]{#calibre_link-919} causes without effects.

4\. When form exists,

A cause of the arising of form is not tenable.

When form is non-existent,

A cause of the arising of form is not tenable.

5\. Form itself without a cause

Is not possible or tenable.

Therefore, think about form, but

Do not construct theories about form.

[]{#calibre_link-409}6. The assertion that the effect and cause are
similar

Is not acceptable.

The assertion that[]{#calibre_link-920} they are not similar

Is also not acceptable.

7\. Feelings, discriminations, and dispositions

And consciousness and all such things

Should be thought of

In the same way as material form.

There is not the slightest space.

If it arose prior to the characteristic

Then it would, absurdly, arise without a characteristic.

Has never existed.

If nothing lacks a characteristic,

Where do characteristics come to be?

3\. Neither in the uncharacterized nor in the characterized

In something different from these two.

4\. If characteristics do not appear,

Then it is not tenable to posit the characterized object.

If the characterized object is not posited,

There will be no characteristic either.

5\. From this it follows that there is no characterized

And no existing characteristic.

Nor is there any entity

1\. If prior to desire

And without desire there were a desirous one,

Desire would depend on him.

Desire would exist when there is a desirous one.

2\. Were there no desirous one, moreover,

Where would desire occur?

Whether or not desire or the desirous one exist.

The analysis would be the same.

3\. Desire and the desirous one

Cannot arise[]{#calibre_link-930} together.

In that case, desire and the desirous one

Would not be mutually contingent.

4\. In identity there is no simultaneity.

A thing is not simultaneous with itself.

But if there is difference,

Then how would there be simultaneity?

[]{#calibre_link-454}5. If in identity there were simultaneity,

Then it could occur without association.

If in difference there were simultaneity,

It could occur without association.

Are established as different,

Then why would you think

That they are simultaneous?

8\. Since difference is not established,

If you assert that they are simultaneous,

Since they are established as[]{#calibre_link-932} simultaneous,

Do you also assert that they are different?

9\. Since nothing different has been established,

If one is asserting simultaneity,

Then it would also have the three characteristics.

If arising is not produced,

How could the characteristics of the produced exist?

2\. If the three, arising, etc., are separate,

They cannot function as the characteristics of the produced.

But how could they be joined

In one thing simultaneously?

3\. If arising, abiding,[]{#calibre_link-936} and ceasing

Have characteristics other than those of the produced,

There would be an infinite regress.

If they don't, they would not be produced.

4\. The arising of arising only gives rise

To the basic arising.

The arising of the basic arising

Gives rise to arising.

5\. If, as you say, the arising of arising

Gives rise to the basic arising,

Not arisen[]{#calibre_link-938} from the basic arising, give rise to

How does that nonarisen basis

7\. If this nonarisen

Could give rise to that,

Then, as you wish,

It will give rise to that which is arising.

So arising gives rise to itself

And to[]{#calibre_link-939} other arisen things.

9\. In the butterlamp and its place,

There is no darkness.

What then does the butterlamp illuminate?

For illumination is the clearing of darkness.

10\. If the arising butterlamp

Does not reach darkness,

How could that arising butterlamp

Have cleared the darkness?

11\. If the illumination of darkness occurs

Without the butterlamp reaching darkness,

All of the darkness[]{#calibre_link-940} in the world

Should be illuminated.

12\. If, when it is illuminated,

The butterlamp illuminates itself and others,

Darkness should, without a doubt,

Conceal itself and others.

[]{#calibre_link-941}13. How could this arising, being nonarisen,

Give rise to itself?

And if it is arisen from another,

Having arisen, what is the need for another arising?

14\. The arisen, the nonarisen, and that which is arising

[]{#calibre_link-942}Do not arise in any way at all.

Thus they should be understood

Just like the gone, the not-gone, and the going.

15\. When there is arising but not yet

That which is arising,

How can we say that that which is arising

Depends on this arising?

Such a thing is essentially peaceful.

Therefore that which is arising and arising itself

Are themselves peaceful.

What existents can endure?

25\. Stasis cannot endure through itself

Or through another stasis.

Just as arising cannot arise from itself

Or from another arising.

26\. The ceasing of what[]{#calibre_link-947} has ceased does not
happen.

What has not yet ceased does not cease.

Nor does that which is ceasing.

What nonarisen can cease?

27\. The cessation of what is static

Is not tenable.

Nor is the cessation of

Something not static tenable.

[]{#calibre_link-404}28. Being static does not cease

Through being static itself.

Nor does being static cease

Through another instance of being static.

29\. When the arising[]{#calibre_link-948} of any entity

Is not tenable.

Then the cessation of any entity

Is not tenable.

30\. For an existent thing

Cessation is not tenable.

A single thing being an entity and

A nonentity is not tenable.

Through action and agent

All remaining things should be understood.

1\. Self-restraint and benefiting others

With a compassionate mind is the Dharma.

This is the seed for

Fruits in this and future lives.

2\. The Unsurpassed Sage has said

That actions are either intention or intentional.

The varieties of these actions

Have been announced in many ways.

3\. Of these, what is called "intention"

Is mental[]{#calibre_link-1010} desire.

What is called "intentional"

Comprises the physical and verbal.

4\. Speech and action and all

Kinds of unabandoned and abandoned actions,

And resolve

As well as ...

[]{#calibre_link-1011}5. Virtuous and nonvirtuous actions

Derived from pleasure,

As well as intention and morality:

These seven are the kinds of action.

6\. If until the time of ripening

Action had to remain in place, it would have to be[]{#calibre_link-1012}
permanent.

If it has ceased, then having ceased,

How will a fruit arise?

7\. As for a continuum, such as the sprout,

It comes from a seed.

From that arises the fruit. Without a seed,

It would not come into being.

8\. Since from the seed comes the continuum,

and from the continuum comes the fruit,

The seed precedes the fruit.

Therefore there is neither nonexistence nor permanence.

9\. So,[]{#calibre_link-1013} in a mental continuum,

From a preceding intention

A consequent mental state arises.

Without this, it would not arise.

10\. Since from the intention comes the continuum,

And from the continuum the fruit arises,

Action precedes the fruit.

Therefore there is neither nonexistence nor permanence.

11\. The ten pure paths of action

Are the method of realizing the Dharma.

These fruits of the Dharma[]{#calibre_link-1014} in this and other lives

Are the five pleasures.

[]{#calibre_link-463}12. If such an analysis were advanced,

There would be many great errors.

Therefore, this analysis

Is not tenable here.

13\. I will then explain what is tenable here:

The analysis propounded by all

Buddhas, self-conquerors

And disciples according to which ...

14\. Action is like an uncancelled promissory note

And like a debt.

Of the realms[]{#calibre_link-1015} it is fourfold.

Moreover, its nature is neutral.

15\. By abandoning, that is not abandoned.

Abandonment occurs through meditation.

Therefore, through the nonexpired,

The fruit of action arises.

16\. If abandonment occurred through abandoning, and

If action were destroyed through transformation,

The destruction of action, etc.,

And other errors would arise.

17\. From all these actions in[]{#calibre_link-1016} a realm,

Whether similar or dissimilar,

At the moment of birth

Only one will arise.

18\. In this visible world,

All actions of the two kinds,

Each comprising action and the unexpired separately,

Will remain while ripening.

19\. That fruit, if extinction or death

Occurs, ceases.

[]{#calibre_link-541}Regarding this, a distinction between the stainless

And the stained is drawn.

20\. Emptiness and nonannihilation;

Cyclic existence and nonpermanence:

That action is nonexpiring

Is taught by the Buddha.

21\. Because action does not arise,

It is seen to be without essence.

Because it is not arisen,

It follows that it is nonexpiring.

22\. If action had an essence,

It would, without doubt, be eternal.

Action would be uncreated.

Because there can be no creation of what is eternal.

23\. If an action were[]{#calibre_link-1018} uncreated,

Fear would arise of encountering something not done.

And the error of not preserving

One's vows would arise.

24\. All conventions would then

Be contradicted, without doubt.

It would be impossible to draw a distinction

Between virtue and evil.

Time and time again.

If there were essence, this would follow,

Because action would remain in place.

This affliction is not real in itself.

How can action be real in itself?

Are taught to be the conditions that produce bodies.

If action and affliction

Are empty, what would one say about bodies?

28\. Obstructed by ignorance,

And consumed by passion, the experiencer

Is neither different[]{#calibre_link-1020} from the agent

Nor identical with it.

29\. Since this action

Is not arisen from a condition,

Nor arisen causelessly,

It follows that there is no agent.

30\. If there is no action and agent,

Where could the fruit of action be?

Without a fruit,

Where is there an experiencer?

31\. Just as the teacher, by magic,

Makes a magical illusion, and

By that illusion

Another illusion is created,

[]{#calibre_link-1021}32. In that way are an agent and his action:

The agent is like the illusion.

The action

Is like the illusion's illusion.

Agents and fruits are

Like a city of Gandharvas and

Like a mirage or a dream.

The effect would be without a cause.

7\. If the effect were to arise

Simultaneously with the collection,

Then the produced and the producer

Would arise simultaneously.

8\. If the effect were to arise

Prior to the combination,

Then, without causes and conditions,

The effect would arise causelessly.

9.[]{#calibre_link-1039} If, the cause having ceased, the effect

Were a complete transformation of the cause,

Then a previously arisen cause

Would arise again.

10\. How can a cause, having ceased and dissolved,

Give rise to a produced effect?

How can a cause joined with its effect produce it

If they persist together?

11\. Moreover, if not joined with its cause,

What effect can be made to arise?

Neither seen nor[]{#calibre_link-1040} unseen by causes

Are effects produced.

12\. There is never a simultaneous connection

Of a past effect

With a past, a nonarisen,

Or an arisen cause.

[]{#calibre_link-511}13. There is never a simultaneous connection

Of an arisen effect

With a past, a nonarisen,

Or an arisen cause.

14\. There is never a simultaneous connection

Of a nonarisen effect

With a past, a nonarisen,

Or an arisen cause.

15\. Without[]{#calibre_link-1041} connecting,

How can a cause produce an effect?

Where there is connection,

How can a cause produce an effect?

16\. If the cause is empty of an effect,

How can it produce an effect?

If the cause is not empty of an effect,

How can it produce an effect?

17\. A nonempty effect does not arise.

The nonempty would not cease.

This nonempty would be

The nonceased and the nonarisen.

18\. How can[]{#calibre_link-1042} the empty arise?

How can the empty cease?

The empty will hence also

Be the nonceased and nonarisen.

19\. For cause and effect to be identical

Is not tenable.

For cause and effect to be different

Is not tenable.

20\. If cause and effect were identical,

Produced and producer would be identical.

[]{#calibre_link-1043}If cause and effect were different,

Cause and non-cause would be alike.

21\. If an effect had[]{#calibre_link-1044} entitihood,

What could have caused it to arise?

If an effect had no entitihood,

What could have caused it to arise?

22\. If something is not producing an effect,

It is not tenable to attribute causality.

If it is not tenable to attribute causality,

Then of what will the effect be?

23\. If the combination

Of causes and conditions

Is not self-produced,

How does it produce an effect?

24.[]{#calibre_link-1045} Therefore, not made by combination,

And not without a combination can the effect arise.

If there is no effect,

Where can there be a combination of conditions?

7\. There is no becoming of the disappeared.

There is no becoming of the nondisappeared.

There is no destruction of the disappeared.

There is no destruction of the nondisappeared.

8\. When no entities exist,

There is no becoming or destruction.

Without becoming and destruction,

There are no existent entities.

9\. It is not tenable for the empty

To become or to be destroyed,

It[]{#calibre_link-1052} is not tenable for the nonempty

To become or to be destroyed.

10\. It is not tenable

That destruction and becoming are identical.

It is not tenable

That destruction and becoming are different.

11\. If you think you see both

Destruction and becoming,

Then you see destruction and becoming

Through impaired vision.

12\. An entity does not arise from an entity.

An entity does not arise from[]{#calibre_link-1053} a nonentity.

A nonentity does not arise from a nonentity.

A nonentity does not arise from an entity.

[]{#calibre_link-291}13. An entity does not arise from itself.

It is not arisen from another.

It is not arisen from itself and another.

How can it be arisen?

14\. If one accepts the existence of entities,

Permanence and the view of complete nonexistence follow.

For these entities

Must be both permanent and[]{#calibre_link-1054} impermanent.

15\. If one accepts the existence of entities

Nonexistence and permanence will not follow.

Cyclic existence is the continuous

Becoming and destruction of causes and effects.

16\. If cyclic existence is the continuous

Becoming and destruction of causes and effects,

Then from the nonarising of the destroyed

Follows the nonexistence of cause.

17\. If entities exist with entitihood,

::: calibre1

Then their nonexistence would make no sense.

But at the time of nirvāṇa,

Cyclic existence ceases completely, having been pacified.

18\. If the final one has ceased,

The existence of a first one makes no sense.

If the final one has not ceased,

The existence of a first one makes no sense.

19\. If when the final one was ceasing,

Then the first[]{#calibre_link-1056} was arising,

The one ceasing would be one.

The one arising would be another.

The aggregates are not in him, nor is he in the aggregates.

The Tathāgata does not possess the aggregates.

What is the Tathāgata?

2\. If the Buddha depended on the aggregates,

He would not exist through[]{#calibre_link-1060} an essence.

Not existing through an essence,

How could he exist through otherness-essence?

3\. Whatever is dependent on another entity,

Its selfhood is not appropriate.

Through grasping?

9\. Whatever grasping there is

Does not exist through essence.

And when something does not[]{#calibre_link-1064} exist through itself,

It can never exist through otherness-essence.

10\. Thus grasping and grasper

Together are empty in every respect.

How can an empty Tathāgata

Be known through the empty?

11\. "Empty" should not be asserted.

"Nonempty" should not be asserted.

Neither both nor neither should be asserted.

They are only used nominally.

12\. How can the tetralemma[]{#calibre_link-1065} of permanent and

About one who has achieved Nirvāṇa.

14\. Since he is by nature[]{#calibre_link-1066} empty,

They all depend on

The pleasant, the unpleasant, and errors.

2\. Since whatever depends on the pleasant and the unpleasant

Does not exist through an essence,

The defilements

Do not really exist.

3\. The self's existence or nonexistence

Has in no way been established.

Without that, how[]{#calibre_link-1070} could the defilements'

Existence or nonexistence be established?

4\. The defilements are somebody's.

But that one has not been established.

Without that possessor,

The defilements are nobody's.

5\. View the defilements as you view your self:

They are not in the defiled in the fivefold way.

[]{#calibre_link-457}View the defiled as you view your self:

It is not in the defilements in the fivefold way.

6\. The[]{#calibre_link-1071} pleasant, the unpleasant, and the errors

Do not exist through essence.

Which pleasant, unpleasant, and errors

could the defilements depend upon?

7\. Form, sound, taste, touch,

Desire, hatred, and confusion.

8\. Form, sound, taste, touch,

Smell, and concepts of things: These six

Should be seen as only like a city[]{#calibre_link-1072} of the
Gandharvas and

Like a mirage or a dream.

9\. How could the

Pleasant and unpleasant arise

In those that are like an illusory person

And like a reflection?

10\. We say that the unpleasant

Is dependent upon the pleasant,

Since without depending on the pleasant there is none.

It follows that the pleasant is not tenable.

11\. We say that the pleasant

Is dependent upon the unpleasant.

[]{#calibre_link-1073}Without the unpleasant there wouldn't be any.

It follows that the unpleasant is not tenable.

12\. Where there is no pleasant,

How can there be desire?

Where there is no unpleasant,

How can there be anger?

[]{#calibre_link-524}13. If to grasp onto the view

"The impermanent is permanent" were an error,

Since in emptiness there is nothing impermanent,

How could that grasping be an error?

14\. If to grasp onto[]{#calibre_link-1074} the view

"The impermanent is permanent" were an error,

Why isn't grasping onto the view

"In emptiness there is nothing impermanent" an error?

15\. That by means of which there is grasping, and the grasping,

And the grasper, and all that is grasped:

All are being relieved,

It follows that there is no grasping.

16\. If there is no grasping,

Whether erroneous or otherwise,

Who will come to[]{#calibre_link-1075} be in error?

Who will have no error?

17\. Error does not develop

In one who is in error.

Error does not develop

In one who is not in error.

18\. Error does not develop

In one in whom error is arising.

In whom does error develop?

Examine this on your own!

19\. If error is not arisen,

How could it come to exist?

If error has not arisen,

How could one be in error?

20\. Since an entity does[]{#calibre_link-1076} not arise from itself,

Nor from another,

[]{#calibre_link-500}Nor from another and from itself,

How could one be in error?

21\. If the self and the pure,

The permanent and the blissful existed,

The self, the pure, the permanent,

And the blissful would not be deceptive.

22\. If the self and the pure,

The permanent and the blissful did not exist,

The nonself, the impure, the permanent,

And suffering would not[]{#calibre_link-1077} exist.

23\. Thus, through the cessation of error

Ignorance ceases.

When ignorance ceases

The compounded phenomena, etc., cease.

24\. If someone's defilements

Existed through his essence,

How could they be relinquished?

Who could relinquish the existent?

Neither arising nor ceasing,

Then for you, it follows that

The Four Noble Truths do not exist.

2\. If the Four Noble Truths do not exist,

Then knowledge, abandonment,

Meditation and manifestation

3\. If these things do not exist,

If emptiness is conceived in this way,

6\. Hence you assert that there are no real fruits.

And no Dharma. The Dharma itself

And the conventional truth

Will be contradicted.

7\. We say that this understanding of yours

Of emptiness and the purpose of emptiness

And of the significance of emptiness is incorrect.

As a consequence you are harmed by it.

8\. The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma

Is based on two truths:

A truth of worldly[]{#calibre_link-1084} convention

And an ultimate truth.

9\. Those who do not understand

The distinction drawn between these two truths

Do not understand

The Buddha's profound truth.

10\. Without a foundation in the conventional truth,

The significance of the ultimate cannot be taught.

Without understanding the significance of the ultimate,

Liberation is not achieved.

11\. By a misperception of emptiness

A person[]{#calibre_link-1085} of little intelligence is destroyed.

Like a snake incorrectly seized

Or like a spell incorrectly cast.

12\. For that reason---that the Dharma is

Deep and difficult to understand and to learn---

The Buddha's mind despaired of

Being able to teach it.

[]{#calibre_link-413}13. You have presented fallacious refutations

That are not relevant to emptiness.

Your confusion about emptiness

Does not belong to me.

14\. For[]{#calibre_link-1086} him to whom emptiness is clear,

Everything becomes clear.

For him to whom emptiness is not clear,

Nothing becomes clear.

15\. When you foist on us

All of your errors

You are like a man who has mounted his horse

And has forgotten that very horse.

16\. If you perceive the existence of all things

In terms of their essence,

Then this perception of all things

Will be without the perception[]{#calibre_link-1087} of causes and
conditions.

17\. Effects and causes

And agent and action

And conditions and arising and ceasing

And effects will be rendered impossible.

18\. Whatever is dependently co-arisen

That is explained to be emptiness.

That, being a dependent designation,

Is itself the middle way.

19\. Something that is not dependently arisen,

Such a thing does not exist.

Therefore a nonempty thing

Does not exist.

[]{#calibre_link-550}20. If all this were nonempty, as in your view,

There would be no arising and ceasing.

Then the Four Noble Truths

Would become nonexistent.

21\. If it is not dependently arisen,

How could suffering come to be?

Suffering has been taught to be impermanent,

And so cannot come from its own essence.

22\. If something comes from its own essence,

How could it ever be arisen?

[]{#calibre_link-1089}It follows that if one denies emptiness

There can be no arising (of suffering).

23\. If suffering had an essence,

Its cessation would not exist.

So if an essence is posited,

One denies cessation.

24\. If the path had an essence,

Cultivation would not be appropriate.

If this path is indeed cultivated,

It cannot have an essence.

25\. If suffering, arising, and

Ceasing are nonexistent,

By[]{#calibre_link-1090} what path could one seek

To obtain the cessation of suffering?

26\. If nonunderstanding comes to be

Through its essence,

How will understanding arise?

Isn't essence stable?

27\. In the same way, the activities of

Relinquishing, realizing, and meditating

[]{#calibre_link-1091}And the four fruits

Would not be possible.

28\. For an essentialist,

Since the fruits through their essence

Are already unrealized,

[]{#calibre_link-1092}In what way could one attain them?

29\. Without the fruits, there are no attainers of the fruits,

Or enterers. From this it follows that

The eight kinds of persons do not exist.

If these don't exist, there is no spiritual community.

30\. From the nonexistence of the Noble Truths

Would follow the nonexistence of the true doctrine.

If there is no doctrine and no spiritual community,

How could[]{#calibre_link-1093} a Buddha arise?

31\. For you, it would follow that a Buddha

Arises independent of enlightenment.

And for you, enlightenment would arise

Independent of a Buddha.

32\. For you, one who through his essence

Was unenlightened,

Even by practicing the path to enlightenment

Could not achieve enlightenment.

33\. Moreover, one could never perform

Right or wrong actions.

If this were all nonempty[]{#calibre_link-1094} what could one do?

That with an essence cannot be produced.

34\. For you, from neither right nor wrong actions

Would the fruit arise.

If the fruit arose from right or wrong actions,

According to you, it wouldn't exist.

[]{#calibre_link-466}35. If, for you, a fruit arose

From right or wrong actions,

Then, having arisen from right or wrong actions,

How could that fruit be nonempty?

36\. If dependent arising[]{#calibre_link-1095} is denied,

Emptiness itself is rejected.

This would contradict

All of the worldly conventions.

37\. If emptiness itself is rejected,

No action will be appropriate.

There would be action which did not begin,

And there would be agent without action.

38\. If there is essence, the whole world

Will be unarising, unceasing,

And static. The entire phenomenal world

Would be immutable.

39\. If[]{#calibre_link-1096} it (the world) were not empty,

Then action would be without profit.

The act of ending suffering and

Abandoning misery and defilement would not exist.

40\. Whoever sees dependent arising

Also sees suffering

And its arising

And its cessation as well as the path.

That, when it is not dependent and changing,

2\. The view "in the future I will become other" or "I will not do so"

And that the world is limited, etc.,

All of these views

Depend on a final limit.

3\. To say "I was in the past"

Is not tenable.

What existed[]{#calibre_link-1118} in the past

Is not identical to this one.

4\. According to you, this self is that,

But the appropriator is different.

If it is not the appropriator,

What is your self?

5\. Having shown that there is no self

Other than the appropriator,

The appropriator should be the self.

But it is not your self.

[]{#calibre_link-1119}6. Appropriating is not the self.

It arises and ceases.

How can one accept that

Future[]{#calibre_link-1120} appropriating is the appropriator?

7\. A self that is different

From the appropriating is not tenable.

If it were different, then in a nonappropriator

There should be appropriation. But there isn't.

8\. So it is neither different from the appropriating

Nor identical to the appropriating.

There is no self without appropriation.

But it is not true that it does not exist.

9\. To say "in the[]{#calibre_link-1121} past I wasn't"

Would not be tenable.

This person is not different

From whoever existed in previous times.

10\. If this one were different,

Then if that one did not exist, I would still exist.

If this were so,

Without death, one would be born.

11\. Annihilation and the exhaustion of action would follow;

Different agents' actions

Would be experienced by each other.

That and other such things[]{#calibre_link-1122} would follow.

12\. Nothing comes to exist from something that did not exist.

From this errors would arise.

The self would be produced

Or, existing, would be without a cause.

13\. So, the views "I existed," "I didn't exist,"

Both or neither,

[]{#calibre_link-509}In the past

Are untenable.

14\. To say "in the future I will exist or

Will not exist,"

Such a view is like

Those involving the past.

15\. If a human[]{#calibre_link-1123} were a god,

On such a view there would be permanence.

The god would be unborn.

For any permanent thing is unborn.

16\. If a human were different from a god,

On such a view there would be impermanence.

If the human were different from the god,

A continuum would not be tenable.

17\. If one part were divine and

One part were human,

It would be both permanent and impermanent.

That would be[]{#calibre_link-1124} irrational.

18\. If it could be established that

It is both permanent and impermanent,

Then it could be established that

It is neither permanent nor impermanent.

19\. If anyone had come from anyplace

And were then to go someplace,

It would follow that cyclic existence was beginningless.

This is not the case.

20\. If nothing is permanent,

What will be impermanent,

Permanent and impermanent,

Or neither?

[]{#calibre_link-414}21. If the world were limited,

How could there be another world?

If the world were unlimited,

How could there be another world?

22\. Since the continuum of the aggregates

Is like the flame of a butterlamp,

It follows that neither its finitude

Nor its infinitude makes sense.

23\. If the previous were disintegrating

And these aggregates, which depend

Upon those aggregates, did[]{#calibre_link-1126} not arise,

## **[]{#calibre_link-324 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-38 .calibre4}Introduction to the Commentary** {#introduction-to-the-commentary .h1}

Nāgārjuna, who lived in South India in approximately the second century
C.E., is undoubtedly the most important, influential, and widely studied
Mahāyāna Buddhist philosopher. He is the founder of the Mādhyamika,
or[]{#calibre_link-1135} Middle Path schools of Mahāyāna Buddhism. His
considerable corpus includes texts addressed to lay audiences, letters
of advice to kings, and the set of penetrating metaphysical and
epistemological treatises that represent the foundation of the highly
sceptical and dialectical analytic philosophical school known as
Mā[]{#calibre_link-1136}dhyamika. Most important of these is his largest
and best known text, *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* (literally *Fundamental
Verses on the Middle Way).* This text in turn inspires a huge
commentarial literature in Sanskrit, Tibetan, Chinese, Korean and
Japanese. Divergences on interpretation of
*Mūlamadhyamakakā[]{#calibre_link-1137}rikā* often determine the splits
between major philosophical schools. So, for instance, the distinction
between two of the three major Mahāyāna philosophical schools,
Svātantrika-Mādhyamika and Prāsaṅ[]{#calibre_link-1138}gika-Mādhyamika
reflect, inter alia, distinct readings of this text, itself taken as
fundamental by scholars within each of these
schools.[]{#calibre_link-555}[^1^](#calibre_link-100){.nounder}

The treatise itself is composed in very terse, often cryptic verses,
with much of the explicit argument suppressed, generating significant
interpretive challenges. But the uniformity of the philosophical
methodology and the clarity[]{#calibre_link-1139} of the central
philosophical vision []{#calibre_link-377}expressed in the text together
provide a considerable fulcrum for exegesis. Moreover, the rich
commentarial literature generates a number of distinct and illuminating
readings. The central topic of the text is emptiness---the Buddhist
technical term for the lack of independent existence, inherent
existence, or essence in things. Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1140}rjuna
relentlessly analyzes phenomena or processes that appear to exist
independently and argues that they cannot so exist, and yet, though
lacking the inherent existence imputed to them either by naive common
sense or by sophisticated realistic philosophical
theory,[]{#calibre_link-557}[^2^](#calibre_link-101){.nounder} these
phenomena are not nonexistent---they are, he argues, conventionally
real.

This dual thesis of the conventional reality of
phenomena[]{#calibre_link-1141} together with their lack of inherent
existence depends upon the complex doctrine of the two truths or two
realities---a conventional or nominal truth and an ultimate truth---and
upon a subtle and surprising doctrine regarding their relation. It is,
in fact, this sophisticated development of the doctrine of the two
truths as a vehicle for understanding Buddhist metaphysics and
epistemology that[]{#calibre_link-1142} is Nāgārjuna's greatest
philosophical contribution. If the analysis in terms of emptiness is the
substantive heart of *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā,* the method of reductio ad
absurdum is the methodological core. Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1143}rjuna,
like Western sceptics, systematically eschews the defense of positive
metaphysical doctrines regarding the nature of things, arguing rather
that any such positive thesis is incoherent and that, in the end, our
conventions and our conceptual framework can never be justified by
demonstrating their correspondence []{#calibre_link-368}to an
independent reality. Rather, he suggests, what counts as real depends
precisely[]{#calibre_link-1144} on our
conventions.[]{#calibre_link-559}[^3^](#calibre_link-102){.nounder}

For Nāgārjuna and his followers this point is connected deeply and
directly with the emptiness of phenomena. That is, for instance, when a
Mādhyamika philosopher says of a table that it is empty, that assertion
by itself is incomplete. It invites the question, Empty of what? And
the[]{#calibre_link-1145} answer is, Empty of inherent existence, or
self-nature, or, in more Western terms,
*essence.*[]{#calibre_link-560}[^4^](#calibre_link-103){.nounder} Now,
to say that the table is empty is hence simply to say that it lacks
essence and importantly *not* to say that it is completely
nonexistent.[]{#calibre_link-561}[^5^](#calibre_link-104){.nounder} To
say that it lacks essence, the Mādhyamika philosopher will explain, is
to say, as the Tibetans like to put it, that it does
not[]{#calibre_link-1146} exist "from its own side"---that its existence
*as the object that it is---as a table---* depends not on *it,* nor on
any purely nonrelational characteristics, but depends on us as well.
That is, if our culture had not evolved this manner of furniture, what
appears to us to be an obviously unitary object might instead be
correctly described as five objects: []{#calibre_link-375}four quite
useful sticks absurdly surmounted by[]{#calibre_link-1147} a pointless
slab of stick-wood waiting to be carved. Or we would have no reason to
indicate this particular temporary arrangement of this matter as an
object at all, as opposed to a brief intersection of the histories of
some trees. It is also to say that the table depends for its existence
on its parts, on its causes, on its material, and so forth. Apart from
these, there is no table. The table,[]{#calibre_link-1148} we might say,
is a purely arbitrary slice of space-time chosen by us as the referent
of a single name and not an entity demanding, on its own, recognition
and a philosophical analysis to reveal its essence. That independent
character is precisely what it lacks on this
view.[]{#calibre_link-563}[^6^](#calibre_link-105){.nounder}

So from the standpoint of Mādhyamika philosophy, when we ask of a
phenomenon, Does it exist?,[]{#calibre_link-1149} we must always pay
careful attention to the sense of the word "exist" that is at work. We
might mean *exist inherently,* that is, in virtue of being a substance
independent of its attributes, in virtue of having an essence, and so
forth, or we might mean *exist conventionally,* that is to exist
dependently, to be the conventional referent of a term, but not to have
any independent existence. No phenomenon,[]{#calibre_link-1150}
Nāgārjuna will argue, exists in the first sense. But that does *not*
entail that all phenomena are nonexistent tout court. Rather, to the
degree that anything exists, it exists in the latter sense, that is,
nominally, or conventionally. It will be important to keep this
ambiguity in "exists" in mind throughout the text, particularly
in[]{#calibre_link-1151} order to see the subtle interplay between the
two truths and the way in which the doctrine of the emptiness of
emptiness resolves apparent paradoxes in the account.

And this analysis in terms of emptiness---an analysis refusing to
characterize the nature of anything precisely because it denies that we
can make sense of the idea of a thing's nature---proceeding by
[]{#calibre_link-319}the relentless refutation of
any[]{#calibre_link-1152} attempt to provide such a positive analysis,
is applied by Nāgārjuna to all phenomena, including, most radically,
emptiness itself. For if Nāgārjuna merely argued that all phenomena are
empty, one might justly indict him for merely replacing one analysis of
things with another,[]{#calibre_link-1153} that is, with arguing that
emptiness is the essence of all things. But Nāgārjuna, as we shall see,
argues that emptiness itself is empty. It is not a selfexistent void
standing behind a veil of illusion comprising conventional reality, but
merely a characteristic of conventional reality. And this, as we shall
see, is what provides the[]{#calibre_link-1154} key to understanding the
deep unity between the two
truths.[]{#calibre_link-565}[^7^](#calibre_link-106){.nounder}

While Nāgārjuna is a powerfully original thinker, he is clearly and
self-consciously operating squarely within the framework of Buddhist
philosophy. As such, Nāgārjuna accepts and takes it as incumbent upon
him to[]{#calibre_link-1155} provide an account of the Four Noble
Truths, nirvāṇa, buddhahood, and other fundamental Buddhist
soteriological conceptions. Moreover, he takes it as a fundamental
philosophical task to provide an understanding of what Buddhist
philosophy refers to as *pratīyasamutpāda*---dependent coorigination.
This term denotes the nexus[]{#calibre_link-1156} between phenomena in
virtue of which events depend on other events, composites depend on
their parts, and so forth. Exactly how this dependency is spelled out,
and exactly what its status is, is a matter of considerable debate
within Buddhist philosophy, just as the nature of causation and
explanation is a matter of great dispute within Western philosophy.
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1157}rjuna is very much concerned to stake out a
radical and revealing position in this debate. We will, in fact, see
that this position and its connection to his understanding of emptiness
and the nirvāna-saṃsāra relation provides the key to understanding his
entire text.

*Mūlamadhyamakakā[]{#calibre_link-1158}rikā* is divided into
twenty-seven chapters, which fall roughly, though by no means
officially, into four sections. In the first section of the text,
comprising Chapters I through VII, Nāgārjuna discusses the fundamental
theoretical constructs in Buddhist ontology, such as dependent
origination, change and[]{#calibre_link-1159} impermanence,
[]{#calibre_link-326}perception, the aggregates that compose the self,
the elements that constitute the universe, and the relation between
substance and attribute. In the second major section, Chapters VIII
through XIII, Nāgārjuna focuses on the nature of the self and of
subjective experience. Chapters XIV through XXI are primarily
concerned[]{#calibre_link-1160} with the external world and the relation
of the self to objects. The final section, Chapters XXII through XXVII,
addresses phenomena associated with the ultimate truth, such as
bud-dhahood, emptiness, and nirvāṇa, and the relation of the
conventional to the ultimate and of saṃsāra to
nirvā[]{#calibre_link-1161}na. The chapters that form the climax of the
text are found in this section. But it is important to note that in fact
the dialectical structure of the text requires a reading of these
chapters in order to fully grasp the import of the earlier ones. This is
because the doctrine of the emptiness of emptiness does not fully emerge
until this point, and it is crucial to Nā[]{#calibre_link-1162}gārjuna's
argument that all phenomena are empty and that their emptiness is also
empty.[]{#calibre_link-567}[^8^](#calibre_link-107){.nounder}

The order of the chapters is often, though not always, important. Often
a chapter will consider a phenomenon held by a proponent of another
philosophical school to be inherently existent. Or an opponent may
charge Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1163}rjuna with denying the actuality of a
phenomenon in virtue of asserting its emptiness. In his analysis,
Nāgārjuna will typically argue that the phenomenon proposed as
inherently existent cannot be so and indeed is empty, or that the
phenomenon whose existence he is charged with denying is, in fact, on
his analysis, while nonexistent from[]{#calibre_link-1164} the ultimate
point of view, conventionally existent. In each case, he will argue that
the functions the opponent thought could only be served by an inherently
existent phenomenon can, in fact, be served only by empty phenomena. But
quite often these analyses will inspire natural rejoinders of the form,
"Yes, *x* might well be empty and only conventionally existent, but we
can't make sense of its[]{#calibre_link-1165} conventional existence
without presupposing the inherent existence of y."
[]{#calibre_link-369}In such cases, the next chapter will typically
address that natural rejoinder. So, for instance, the first chapter
argues that conditions and the relation between phenomena and that on
which they depend are empty. But a natural rejoinder is that even
conventional but actual conditions can only be understood in the
context[]{#calibre_link-1166} of change or impermanence. So Chapter II
addresses change. The text hence forms a single sustained argument with
only a few digressions or changes of subject, generally marked by the
section divisions I have suggested above.

The first chapter addresses dependent origination. While many Western
commentators assert that this chapter opens the text simply because it
addresses a "fundamental doctrine[]{#calibre_link-1167} of
Buddhism,"[]{#calibre_link-569}[^9^](#calibre_link-108){.nounder}my
analysis of the text suggests that Nāgārjuna begins with causation for
deeper, more systematic reasons. In Chapters II through XXI, Nāgārjuna
addresses a wide range of phenomena, including external perceptibles,
psychological processes, relations, putative
substances,[]{#calibre_link-1168} and attributes, arguing that all are
empty. In the final six chapters, Nāgārjuna generalizes the particular
analyses into a broad theory concerning the nature of emptiness itself
and the nature of the ultimate, of liberation, and of the relation
between emptiness and dependent arising. At the close, he replies to
objections. It is generally,[]{#calibre_link-1169} and in my view
correctly, acknowledged that Chapter XXIV, the examination of the Four
Noble Truths, is the central chapter of the text and the climax of the
argument, with Chapter XXV on nirvāṇa and saṃsāra sharing that
spotlight. One verse of Chapter XXIV, verse 18, has received so much
attention that[]{#calibre_link-1170} interpretations of it alone
represent the foundations of major Buddhist schools in East Asia:

18\. Whatever is dependently co-arisen

That is explained to be emptiness.

That, being a dependent designation

Is itself the middle way.

Here Nāgārjuna asserts the fundamental identity of (1) emptiness, or the
ultimate truth; (2) the dependently[]{#calibre_link-1171} originated,
that is, []{#calibre_link-308}all phenomena; and (3) verbal convention.
Moreover, he asserts that understanding this relation is itself the
middle-way philosophical view he articulates in *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā.*
This verse and the discussion in the chapters that follow provide the
fulcrum for Candrakīrti's more explicit
characterization[]{#calibre_link-1172} of the emptiness of emptiness as
an interpretation of Nāgārjuna's philosophical system---the
interpretation that is definitive of the Prāsangika-Mādhyamika
school.[]{#calibre_link-571}[^10^](#calibre_link-109){.nounder} In what
follows I will provide an interpretation of the text inspired by the
centrality of this verse and of the[]{#calibre_link-1173} chapters
forming its context that harmonizes with Candrakīrti's. In fact, on my
reading of the text this doctrine is already found in the opening
chapter---the examination of conditions. Reading the text in this way
locates the doctrine of the emptiness of emptiness not only as a
dramatic philosophical conclusion to be drawn at the end of twenty-four
chapters of argument, but as the perspective
implicit[]{#calibre_link-1174} in the argument from the very beginning
and only rendered explicit in XXIV. Reading the text in this way will
show us exactly how XXIV: 18 is to be understood and just why a proper
understanding of causality is so central to Buddhist philosophy.

When a Westerner first encounters *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* or other
Mā[]{#calibre_link-1175}dhyamika texts, the philosophical approach can
appear highly metaphysical and downright weird. The unfamiliar
philosophical vocabulary, the highly negative dialectic, and the cryptic
verse form are indeed forbidding. Most bizarre of all, however, at first
glance is the doctrine that all phenomena, including self and its
objects, are empty. For indeed Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1176}rjuna and his
followers do argue that the entire everyday world is, from the ultimate
standpoint, nonexistent. And that does appear to stand just a bit deeper
into philosophical left field than even Berkeley dares to play. But if
the interpretation I will urge is adopted, the real central thrust of
Mādhyamika is the demystification of this apparently mystical
conclusion.[]{#calibre_link-1177} While it might appear that the
Mādhyamikas argue that nothing really exists except a formless void, in
fact the actuality of []{#calibre_link-378}the entire phenomenal world,
persons and all, is recovered within that
emptiness.[]{#calibre_link-573}[^11^](#calibre_link-110){.nounder}

Now a word about the methodology and intent of this commentary: Since
the intended audience is Western philosophers and students of philosophy
whose primary[]{#calibre_link-1178} study has been in the Western
tradition, I have tried throughout, insofar as that is possible without
distortion of the meaning of the text, to explain Nāgārjuna's arguments
and positions in language familiar to Western philosophers. I have
occasionally used analogies to positions and arguments found in Western
texts, but have avoided[]{#calibre_link-1179} doing so where I thought
that the comparisons might force a Procrustean analysis of Nāgārjuna's
own views. And it is, of course, impossible and pointless to completely
recast Nāgārjuna's positions as those with which we in the West are
familiar and to replace his technical terminology[]{#calibre_link-1180}
with ours. For Nāgārjuna is not a Western philosopher. He is an Indian
Buddhist philosopher whose work we approach through a vast Asian
Buddhist commentarial literature. And while many of his concerns,
problems, theses, and arguments are recognizable cousins of ours, many
are not, and there are genuine differences in outlook.

This is[]{#calibre_link-1181} what makes Nāgārjuna's work so exciting to
read and to think about---it provides a genuinely distinctive
perspective on a set of problems and projects that we share. In
commenting on Nāgārjuna's text, I am constantly aware of walking a
philosophical and hermeneutical tightrope.[]{#calibre_link-1182} On the
one hand, one could provide a perfectly traditional commentary on the
text---or better, a translation of one of the major Sanskrit or Tibetan
commentaries---or a transcript of oral commentary by a recognized
scholar of the tradition. Such a commentary would explain in great
detail the way the text is seen from the perspective of its home
tradition and the background of Buddhist controversies
to[]{#calibre_link-1183} which the text responds. A commentary like this
would undoubtedly be of great use to Buddhologists and philosophers
already steeped in Buddhist philosophy []{#calibre_link-329}and its
history. And indeed Sprung's translation of most of Candrakīrti's
*Prasannapadā (Lucid Exposition)*, including the root verses from
*Mūlamadhyamakakārikā[]{#calibre_link-1184}*, partially fulfills this
need. But many of these scholars and students already have access to the
relevant texts in their original languages or to teachers situated
within the Buddhist tradition.

On the other hand, one could try to comment on the text by presenting a
theory of what Nāgārjuna would have said had he been a
twentieth-century[]{#calibre_link-1185} Western philosopher. One could
then feel free to step back from the internecine debates in the
classical Buddhist academy, which were so absorbing to the historical
Nāgārjuna and so distant from our own context, and simply ask how his
arguments would be formulated in the context of the contemporary
philosophical scene. Leaving aside the[]{#calibre_link-1186} question of
how one would identify the possible philosopher denoted by this bizarre
counterfactual, this would again be a profoundly unsatisfying
enterprise. For what makes this a great text is not simply that we can
extrapolate its significance to our own context, but that in reading it,
to borrow Gadamer's metaphor, we are able to fuse its textual horizon
with our own. It is the bringing to the[]{#calibre_link-1187} present of
Nāgārjuna's own concerns, insights, and arguments that is revelatory,
not speculation about a related counterfactual nonentity. And for this
fusion of interpretive horizons to be possible, we must, as much as
possible, respect the original horizon of the text.

Having said this, one must confess the double difficulty of
giving[]{#calibre_link-1188} sense to the phrase "Nāgārjuna's own
concerns, insights, and arguments." The recovery of authorial intent as
a hermeneutic task is problematic (especially when the author is so
culturotemporally remote and when his corpus is as controversial in
composition and interpretation as is Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1189}rjuna's).
But it is equally problematic as a hermeneutic desideratum. For who is
to say that Nāgārjuna was/is the best possible interpreter of
*Mūlamadhyamakakārikā?* After all, he did not have the benefit of the
long commentarial tradition he
spawned.[]{#calibre_link-575}[^12^](#calibre_link-111){.nounder}
A[]{#calibre_link-1190} great text---or, as Gadamer has referred to such
[]{#calibre_link-322}texts, an "eminent text"---grows over time and
merits reinterpretation and rereading as the tradition in which it
participates develops and provides an ever-expanding context for its
reading. Moreover, I am reading Nāgārjuna largely through the lens of
the Tibetan commentarial tradition and[]{#calibre_link-1191} through the
Tibetan translation of his text---the text read and discussed by the
scholars of this long, deep, and intellectually diverse and rich
tradition, few of whom had access to Sanskrit. So the Nāgārjuna whose
views I am exploring is an evolving figure, rooted in the life and
writing of a first or second century Indian monk, of
whom[]{#calibre_link-1192} we know but little, but whose literary life
and identity extends through a complex, sophisticated, and contested
textual and philosophical tradition in India and Tibet and in the West.

As a consequence, in interpreting this text on the Middle Path for a
Western audience, I have sought insofar as possible to find a middle
path between these extremes. I have tried to explain
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1193}gārjuna's own arguments and their context as
straightforwardly as possible without burdening the Western
philosophical reader with extended discussion of the specifically
ancient Indian Buddhist philosophical debates. I have indicated ways in
which very specific arguments can be generalized and have commented on
general structural features of arguments, chapters,
and[]{#calibre_link-1194} the text. I have throughout explained
arguments in Western philosophical terms, while situating those
arguments in their Buddhist context. There may be times when my desire
to make arguments accessible has led to some distortion in Nāgārjuna's
sense. There may also be times at which, by leaving arguments set firmly
within the soteriological[]{#calibre_link-1195} context of Buddhism, I
have left those arguments looking like curios to my Western audience.
Some of this may be unavoidable, but in any case I have sought
specifically to minimize these difficulties.

The interpretation I offer is situated squarely within a
Prāsangika-Mādhyamika interpretation of Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1196}rjuna
(the philosophical school that reads *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* through the
commentaries of Buddhapālita and Candrakīrti). But more specifically, my
reading is heavily influenced by the Tibetan Geluk-pa tradition that
takes as central the commentaries of dGe-'dun-grub,
mKhas-grub-rje,[]{#calibre_link-1197} and especially, Je Tsong Khapa. My
interpretation of the text reflects not []{#calibre_link-330}only
Candrakīrti's and Je Tsong Khapa's commentaries, but also the extended
oral commentary I have received on this text from the eminent Tibetan
Mādhyamika scholars, especially the Ven. Professor Geshe Yeshes
Thap-Khas of the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies and the
Ven. Professor[]{#calibre_link-1198} Gen Lobzang Gyatso of the Institute
of Buddhist Dialectics (I should point out that both of these
scholars---as well as others to whom I am indebted for valuable
conversations, including the Most Ven. Prof. Samdhong Rinpoche and the
Ven. Geshe Namgyal Wangchen---received their education at Drepung
Loseling Monastic College, and so my interpretation also reflects more
particularly the academic tradition[]{#calibre_link-1199} of that
institution).

Having characterized this as a tradition of interpretation, I must
emphasize that it is not, as it is often represented, and as it often
represents itself, a homogeneous tradition. Though there is a
hermeneutic convention in Indo-Tibetan Buddhist literature of presenting
oneself as merely expounding faithfully the views of all of the earlier
commentators, this is almost[]{#calibre_link-1200} never the truth.
There are considerable divergences in interpretation and in
philosophical position within Buddhist schools and within lineages.
Indeed the Tibetan scholars I have regularly consulted, despite the fact
that they shared many of the same teachers and an identical curriculum,
differ widely among themselves on many issues. It would hence be
impossible in any case to represent accurately[]{#calibre_link-1201}
*the* Prāsangika-Mādhyamika interpretation, or even *the* Geluk-pa
interpretation or *the* Drepung Loseling interpretation of
*Mūlamadhyamakakārikā.*

I emphasize that *even* *if one could identify such a homogeneous
interpretation,* I am *not* here presenting the
interpretation[]{#calibre_link-1202} or interpretations of any of these
commentators or scholars, individually or collectively. There are
substantial debates within these traditions regarding interpretative
issues, and I do not consistently side with any particular faction
(though I do think that it is true that my reading never conflicts
directly with that of Candrakīrti); sometimes (as in my reading of the
final chapter)[]{#calibre_link-1203} I depart from the most common
Geluk-pa interpretation entirely in favor of a line more closely
associated with the Nyingma-pa reading of the text. Nor is the purpose
of this text to compare, criticize, and resolve differences between
interpretations. Instead, I here present the text as I
[]{#calibre_link-408}read it, having been influenced by all of these
commentators and teachers, and as I present it to my
Western[]{#calibre_link-1204} colleagues. And my intention in doing so
is to let the text stand alone as a work of philosophy valuable in its
own right to anyone interested in fundamental metaphysical,
epistemological, and soteriological questions, not as a text to be
studied only as part of "the history of philosophy" or "comparative
philosophy."

Moreover, my exposition will be deliberately sympathetic. My goal is not
to[]{#calibre_link-1205} assess Nāgārjuna's philosophy, but to present
and elucidate it and to do so in a way that, while making the text
accessible to Western philosophers, does not disguise the fact that the
text made accessible is an early Indian Mādhyamika philosophical
treatise, read by a Western philosopher through an
extended[]{#calibre_link-1206} Indo-Tibetan commentarial and academic
tradition. It is neither a contemporary treatise nor a second century
text transported miraculously to us without the distortion of time and
cultural distance. Buddhologists may lament the lack of critical
discussion of Buddhist antecedents and commentarial sequellae, and my
Tibetan colleagues may be uncomfortable with some of the tendentious
extensions of[]{#calibre_link-1207} arguments beyond the dialectical
contexts in which they originally arose. Despite this, I hope that for
Western philosophers interested in approaching Mādhyamika in particular
or Buddhist philosophy in general, and for students of Nāgārjuna's
philosophy in the West, this exposition will make his text
more[]{#calibre_link-1208} accessible.

## **[]{#calibre_link-301 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-39 .calibre4}Dedicatory Verses** {#dedicatory-verses-1 .h1}

I prostrate to the Perfect Buddha,\
The best of teachers, who taught that\
Whatever is dependently arisen is\
Unceasing, unborn,\
Unannihilated, not permanent,\
Not coming, not going,\
Without distinction, without identity,\
And free from conceptual construction.

Dedicatory verses are often treated as mere performatives. But these are
special and announce in a subtle but powerful way[]{#calibre_link-1211}
the program of the *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā.* There is a common point being
made in the four pairwise denials, but also a specific insight being
expressed in each. The relation between the conventional and the
ultimate that will be developed in the text is also expressed poetically
in the dedication. In fact, Candrakïrti,[]{#calibre_link-1212} in
*Prasannapadā,* argues that the dedication determines the Prāsangika
reading of Nāgārjuna's text.

Candrakïrti's point is this: In the four pairwise denials, Nāgārjuna is
announcing that the Mā[]{#calibre_link-1213}dhyamika philosopher will
make no positive assertions about the fundamental nature of things. But
this claim must be qualified in several ways. For one thing, we must
take the phrase "the nature of things" very seriously. That is,
Nāgārjuna will be refusing to say anything about the essence of anything
exactly because he will deny the[]{#calibre_link-1214} coherence and
utility of the concept of an essence. For another, it is important to
see that the predications that are rejected are intended to be
understood as []{#calibre_link-376}made from the ultimate standpoint.
That is, the assertions that are being denied are assertions about the
final nature of phenomena that emerge from philosophical analysis. They
are not meant to be ordinary assertions dependent upon
conventions.[]{#calibre_link-1215} Nāgārjuna will deny that it is
possible to assert anything from the ultimate standpoint. He will urge
that all truth is relative and conventional. In fact, as we shall see,
these qualifications turn out to be mutually entailing.

But each pair is significant in its own right. To say that "whatever is
dependently arisen is unceasing and[]{#calibre_link-1216} unborn" is to
emphasize that dependent arising amounts to emptiness, and emptiness
amounts to nonexistence in the ultimate sense. While, as we shall see,
Nāgārjuna defends the conventional existence of phenomena, he will urge
that none of them ultimately exist---that none of them exist
independently of convention with identities and
natures[]{#calibre_link-1217} that they possess in themselves.
Therefore, he will argue, nothing ultimately is born, and from the
ultimate standpoint there is nothing to cease. This is a deep point,
which only emerges completely through a reading of the whole text. But
we can say at this point that this insight contains within it the seeds
of the eventual equation of the phenomenal world with emptiness, of
saṃ[]{#calibre_link-1218}sārawith nirvāṇa, and of the conventional and
the ultimate that are the hallmarks of the Prāsaìgika-Mādhyamika view.

When Nāgārjuna claims that "whatever is dependently arisen is ...
unanihilated and[]{#calibre_link-1219} not permanent" he indicates that
the dependently arisen world and all of its contents are, in virtue of
being dependently arisen and dependent upon conditions, impermanent.
Phenomena come into existence when the conditions upon which they depend
obtain, and they cease to exist when the conditions for their continued
existence no longer obtain. This impermanence, he will argue, entails
their nonexistence[]{#calibre_link-1220} from the ultimate standpoint.
For there will be no principled way to assert criteria for identity for
phenomena that distinguish them in any principled way from their
conditions. Nor can we find any essence they themselves have that
determines their identity. The criteria for identity we posit will end
up being purely conventional. Hence the same is true for any claims of
substantial difference[]{#calibre_link-1221} between things. But this
impermanence and lack of intrinsic identity, while it amounts to the
impossibility []{#calibre_link-364}of ultimate existence, is not
equivalent to annihilation. The empirical reality of things, on
Nāgārjuna's analysis, is not denied by asserting their emptiness.

Finally, to assert that things are "not coming, not going" is to
assert[]{#calibre_link-1222} that the phenomenal world does not contain
intrinsically identifiable entities that persist independently with
those identities over time. As a consequence, there can be no sense in
saying that any entity, independent of conventional imputation, comes
into existence, remains in existence, or goes out of
existence.[]{#calibre_link-577}[^13^](#calibre_link-113){.nounder}

The final remark---that the phenomenal world is free from conceptual
imputation---raises[]{#calibre_link-1223} a tension that is central to
Mādhyamika philosophy and that animates the whole of the text: The
tension between the desire to characterize the ultimate nature of things
and the recognition that all characterization is conventional. For
Nāgārjuna will urge that all conventional phenomena are conceptually
designated,[]{#calibre_link-1224} depending for whatever identity and
existence they have on such designation, and that this merely imputed
status is their ultimate nature. Despite this, however, he will urge
that seeing this fact is at the same time to see that the nature naively
imputed to things and the nature they appear to us to have---inherent
existence---is wholly false. In themselves, from their side, things are
free[]{#calibre_link-1225} of that imputation, even though there is
really nothing at all that can be said from their side. This dynamic
philosophical tension---a tension between the Mādhyamika account of the
limits of what can be coherently said and its analytical ostension of
what can't be said without paradox but must be understood---must
constantly be borne in mind in reading the text. It
is[]{#calibre_link-1226} not an incoherent mysticism, but it is a
logical tightrope act at the very limits of language and metaphysics.

## **[]{#calibre_link-306 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-40 .calibre4}Chapter I  Examination of Conditions** {#chapter-i-examination-of-conditions-1 .h1}

Central to this first chapter is the distinction between causes and
conditions (Skt: *hetu* and *pratyaya*, Tib: *rgyu* and *rkyen*). This
distinction is variously drawn and is
controversial,[]{#calibre_link-579}[^14^](#calibre_link-115){.nounder}
and it is arguably differently understood in Sanskrit and Tibetan. The
way I will understand it here, I argue, makes good, coherent sense not
only of this chapter, but of
*Mū[]{#calibre_link-1229}lamadhyamakakārikā* as a whole. Briefly, we
will understand this distinction as follows: When Nāgārjuna uses the
word "cause" *(hetu, rgyu)*, he has in mind an event or state that has
in it a *power (kriyā,
bya-ba)*[]{#calibre_link-580}[^*15*^](#calibre_link-116){.nounder} to
bring about its effect and has[]{#calibre_link-1230} that power as part
of its essence or nature *(svabhāva, rang bzhin)*. When he uses the term
"condition" on the other hand []{#calibre_link-331} *(pratyaya, rkyen)*,
he has in mind an event, state, or process that can be appealed to in
explaining another event, state, or process without any metaphysical
commitment to any occult connection between explanandum and explanans.
In Chapter I, Nā[]{#calibre_link-1231}gārjuna, we shall see, argues
against the existence of causes and for the existence of a variety of
kinds of
conditions.[]{#calibre_link-582}[^16^](#calibre_link-117){.nounder}

Things are not, however, quite this simple. For in the philosophical
context in which Nāgārjuna is writing, there are those---indeed
including most Buddhist philosophical schools---who
would[]{#calibre_link-1232} accept his classification of conditions, but
who would then assert that in order for conditions to function as
explanatory, they must themselves have an independent inherent
existence. Some---such as the Sarvastivadas or Sautāntrika-Svātantrikas
(despite other differences between these schools regarding
causation)---would argue that the conditions[]{#calibre_link-1233} must
exist as substantially distinct from the conditioned; others, such as
the Cittamātra, would argue that they []{#calibre_link-340}can be of the
same nature.[]{#calibre_link-584}[^17^](#calibre_link-118){.nounder}
Nāgārjuna will evade these particular debates, however, by emphasizing
that the conditions he has in mind must be thought of as empty of
inherent existence and connected[]{#calibre_link-1234} to the phenomena
they condition neither through absolute difference nor through identity.

The argument against causation is tightly intertwined with the positive
account of dependent arising and of the nature of the relation between
conditions and the conditioned. Nāgārjuna begins by stating the
conclusion (I: 1): Entities are neither[]{#calibre_link-1235}
self-caused nor do they come to be through the power of other entities.
That is, there is no causation when causation is thought of as involving
causal activity:[]{#calibre_link-585}[^18^](#calibre_link-119){.nounder}

1\. Neither from itself nor from another,

Nor from both,

Nor without a cause,

Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.

The fourfold classification of positions with regard to the relation
between an active cause and its effect is[]{#calibre_link-1236} meant to
be exhaustive. But it is important to keep in mind that Nāgārjuna was
aware of philosophical schools espousing each of these four positions.
And each of them has something to say for itself if we begin by
supposing a model of causation involving powers as essential properties
of substantially real causes. The first
view---held[]{#calibre_link-1237} prominently by Samkhya
philosophers[]{#calibre_link-586}[^19^](#calibre_link-120){.nounder}
---is that all causation is really self-causation. A proponent of this
view would argue that for a cause to be genuinely the cause of an
effect, that effect must exist potentially in that cause. If it does
not, then the cause might exist without the effect, in which case the
cause would fail to necessitate the effect, in which case it would not
be a genuine[]{#calibre_link-1238} cause. This is
[]{#calibre_link-345}not to say that effects exist in full actuality in
their causes, but that they have a genuine potential existence when
their causes exist. In this case, since the effect is present in the
cause, it already has a kind of existence prior to its appearance. And
it is the fact of this prior potential existence that accounts for the
causal character of the cause. So we can say, on
this[]{#calibre_link-1239} view, that a thing's prior potential
existence is what gives rise to its later actual existence. So effects
are in this sense self-caused. The typical kind of example appealed to
in order to defend this model of causation is the seed and sprout
relation. The sprout, although only actual after germination, is
potential in the seed. Its potentiality is what makes the seed a seed of
that sprout. Moreover,[]{#calibre_link-1240} on this view, the seed and
sprout cannot be distinguished as substantially different. Intuitively
it makes sense to say that they are two stages of the same entity. But
the seed is the cause of the sprout. Hence, the proponent of this view
concludes, the sprout is self-caused.

Causation from another is a more familiar way of thinking of causation
and was the dominant doctrine of causation in[]{#calibre_link-1241} the
Buddhist philosophical milieu in which Nāgārjuna was working. On this
view, causes and their effects are genuinely distinct
phenomena.[]{#calibre_link-588}[^20^](#calibre_link-121){.nounder} They
can be characterized and can in principle exist independently of one
another. But they are related by the fact that one has the power to
bring the other about. The relations between
parents[]{#calibre_link-1242} and children is an example often appealed
to in illustrating this doctrine. Parents bring their children into
existence. But they are not identical entities.

The doctrine of causation by both self and other emerges through a
juxtaposition of the doctrine of causation-from-another and the doctrine
of self-causation. Let us return to the example of the seed. A proponent
of other-causation might[]{#calibre_link-1243} point out that seeds that
are not planted, watered, and so forth, do not sprout. If the sprout
were present in the seed, these other conditions, which are manifestly
other than the sprout, would be otiose. On the
[]{#calibre_link-347}other hand, the proponent of self-causation might
reply: No matter how much you water, nourish, and exhort an infertile
seed---one without the potentially existent sprout---nothing
happens.[]{#calibre_link-1244} So all of the distinct conditions in the
world will not suffice absent the potential existence of the effect. The
happy compromise doctrine that emerges is the doctrine of
causation-by-both: Effects are the result of the joint operation of the
effect itself in potentio and the external conditions necessary to raise
the effect's mode of existence from potentiality to actuality.

The fourth alternative[]{#calibre_link-1245} view of causation is that
things simply spontaneously arise from no particular causes---that there
are no links at all between events. What might motivate such a view?
Well, as we shall see (and as any reader of Sextus Empiricus, Hume, or
Wittgenstein will recall), there are powerful reasons for believing that
none of the three alternatives just rehearsed can be made coherent. And
if one believed[]{#calibre_link-1246} that only if there were either
some identity or difference between causes and effects could there be a
relation of dependency between phenomena, one would be forced to the
nihilistic conclusion that things simply arise causelessly.

Nonetheless, Nāgārjuna notes, there are conditions---in fact four
distinct kinds---that can be appealed to[]{#calibre_link-1247} in the
explanation and prediction of phenomena:

2\. There are four conditions: efficient condition;

Percept-object condition; immediate condition;

Dominant condition, just so.

There is no fifth condition.

The general classification of conditions Nāgārjuna employs is pretty
standard in Indian and especially in Buddhist accounts
of[]{#calibre_link-1248} explanation. But there are two specific
features of Nāgārjuna's presentation that should be noted: First, since
he is writing with specifically soteriological goals in mind, which
require the practicioner to develop a deep insight into the nature of
his/her own mind, there is a specifically psychological emphasis in the
presentation.[]{#calibre_link-1249} We must be aware both of this
emphasis and of the natural generalization away from that particular
domain that the account supports. Second, it will be of paramount
importance to Nāgārjuna that the analysis of []{#calibre_link-341}the
relation of conditions to the conditioned involves ascribing neither
inherent existence nor causal power to the conditions.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1250}
:::

Efficient conditions are those salient events that explain the
occurrence of subsequent events: Striking a match is the efficient
condition for its lighting. My fingers depressing the keys of this
computer is the efficient condition for the creation of this text.

The percept-object condition is in its primary sense the object in the
environment that is the condition for a mind's perception
of[]{#calibre_link-1251} it. So when you see a tree, the physical tree
in the environment is the percept-object condition of your perceptual
state. Now things get vexed here in a number of ways. First, there is no
unanimity in the world, or even in Buddhist philosophy, regarding the
analysis of perception and, hence, no consensus on the view just
adumbrated---that external objects are the percept-object conditions of
perceptual[]{#calibre_link-1252} awareness. Idealists, for instance,
argue that the percept-object conditions are to be located in the
subject. Second, many fans of percept-object conditions, on both sides
of the idealist/realist divide, argue that the substantial existence of
such a condition, and the appropriate exercise of its power to produce
perception, is a necessary condition of perception.
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1253}gārjuna will be concerned to reject any such
analysis---whether idealist or realist---in virtue of his attack on the
notions of substantial existence, substantial difference, and causal
power. Third, within the psychological domain, the account generalizes
beyond perception. Conceptual states, imaginings, reasoning---all can
have percept-object conditions. To Western
philosophical[]{#calibre_link-1254} ears this seems odd. But from the
standpoint of Buddhist epistemology and psychology,
intentional[]{#calibre_link-590}[^21^](#calibre_link-122){.nounder}
activity generally is the natural kind comprised by "perception." So the
point is that the intentional existence of the golden mountain is a
percept-object condition of my being able to doubt that there is such a
thing. Finally, the analysis bears generalization well beyond the
psychological. For[]{#calibre_link-1255} at the most abstract level,
what is distinct about a percept-object condition is its existence
simultaneously with and as a support for what it conditions. So
Nāgārjuna's attack on a substantialist
[]{#calibre_link-336}understanding of this kind of explanans will apply,
mutatis mutandis, to the case of a table supporting a book.

The dominant condition is[]{#calibre_link-1256} the purpose or end for
which an action is undertaken. My hoped for understanding of Mādhyamika
might be the dominant condition for my reading Nāgārjuna's text, its
presence before my eyes the percept-object condition, and the reflected
light striking my eyes the efficient condition. The immediate
conditions[]{#calibre_link-1257} are the countless intermediary
phenomena that emerge upon the analysis of a causal chain, in this case,
the photons striking my retina, the excitation of photoreceptor cells,
and so forth.[]{#calibre_link-592}[^22^](#calibre_link-123){.nounder}

A nonpsychological example might be useful to illustrate the difference
between the four kinds of condition and the picture Nāgārjuna suggests
of[]{#calibre_link-1258} explanation in the most general sense: Suppose
that you ask, "Why are the lights on?" I might reply as follows: (1)
"Because I flicked the switch." I have appealed to an efficient
condition. Or, (2) "Because the wires are in good working order, the
bulbs haven't burned out, and the electricity is flowing." These are
supporting conditions. Or, (3) "The light is the emission of photons
each of which[]{#calibre_link-1259} is emitted in response to the
bombardment of an atom by an electron, and so forth." I have appealed to
a chain of immediate conditions. Or, (4) "So that we can see." This is
the dominant condition. Any of these would be a perfectly good answer to
the "Why?" question. But note that none of them makes reference to any
causal powers or
necessitation.[]{#calibre_link-593}[^23^](#calibre_link-124){.nounder}

[]{#calibre_link-387}The next three verses are crucial to
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1260}gārjuna's understanding of the nature of
conditions and their role in explanation. Nāgārjuna first notes (I: 3)
that in examining a phenomenon and its relations to its conditions, we
don't find that phenomenon somehow contained potentially in those
conditions:

3\. The essence of entities

Is not present in[]{#calibre_link-1261} the conditions, etc....

If there is no essence,

There can be no otherness-essence.

The point being made in the first two lines of the verse is fairly
straightforward. When we examine the set of conditions that give rise to
an entity---for example, the set of conditions we detailed above for the
shining of a lamp, or the conditions for seeing a tree we discussed
previously---no analysis of those conditions[]{#calibre_link-1262}
yields the consequent effect. Dissecting light switches, wires, brains,
and so forth, does not reveal any hidden light. Nor is there a tree
perception to be found already in the existence of the tree, the eye,
and so forth. Rather these phenomena arise as consequences of the
collocation of those conditions. To borrow a Kantian turn of phrase,
phenomena are not analytically contained in their[]{#calibre_link-1263}
conditions; []{#calibre_link-438}rather, a synthesis is required out of
which a phenomenon not antecedently existent comes to be.

But Nāgārjuna, through his use of the phrase "the essence of entities"
*(dngos-po rnams kyi rang bzhin)*, emphasizes a very important
metaphysical consequence of this observation: Given that phenomena
depend upon their conditions[]{#calibre_link-1264} for their existence
and given that nothing answering to an essence of phenomena can be
located in those conditions and given that there is nowhere else that an
essence could come from, it follows that phenomena that arise from
conditions are essenceless. One might argue at this point that just as
phenomena come into existence dependent upon conditions, their essences
come into existence in this[]{#calibre_link-1265} way. But what goes for
phenomena[]{#calibre_link-595}[^24^](#calibre_link-125){.nounder} does
not go for essences. For essences are by definition eternal and fixed.
They are independent. And for a phenomenon to have an essence is for it
to have some permanent independent core. So neither essences nor
phenomena with essences can emerge from conditions.

The next two lines require a careful gloss, both because of the
complexity of the philosophical[]{#calibre_link-1266} point at stake and
because of the Buddhist philosophical term of art I translate as
"otherness-essence" (Skt: *parabhāva*, Tib: *gzhan dngos)*. Let us begin
by glossing that term. In its primary sense it means to have, as a
thing's nature, dependence upon another for existence. So for a table,
for instance, to have otherness-essence, according to a proponent of
this analysis[]{#calibre_link-1267} of the nature of things, might be
for it to have as an essential characteristic the property of depending
for its existence on some pieces of wood, a carpenter, and so forth.
This way of thinking of the nature of things has great appeal---was used
by those who defended the analysis of causation as production from other
and the analysis of causes and their effects according to which they
are[]{#calibre_link-1268} linked by causal powers inhering in the
causes---particularly for other Buddhist schools who would want to join
with Nāgārjuna in denying essence to phenomena. For such a philosopher,
it would be congenial to argue that the table has no essence of its own,
but has the essential property of depending on its parts, causes, and so
[]{#calibre_link-297}forth---an[]{#calibre_link-1269} essential property
that depends critically on another. And it would then be important to
note that this nature relies on the other having an intrinsic connection
to the phenomenon in question, a connection realized in the causal
powers (or other inherently existent relation to the effect) of that
other and, hence, in the other's own nature. Moreover, it is crucial to
such an analysis, if it is not[]{#calibre_link-1270} to lapse into the
absurdities that plague self-causation, that there be a real,
substantial difference in entity---a difference in intrinsic nature
between the dependent phenomenon and the conditions on which it depends.
Absent such a difference, the otherness required in the analysis cannot
be established.[]{#calibre_link-597}[^25^](#calibre_link-126){.nounder}

Given this understanding of otherness-essence, we can see the arguments
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1271}gārjuna is ostending in the last two lines of
this verse. First, since all entities are without their own essences
(that is, without essences that can be specified intrinsically without
reference to anything else), the other with respect to which any
phenomenon is purportedly essentially characterized will be without an
essence, and so there will be no basis on which[]{#calibre_link-1272} to
build this otherness-essence. Second, without individual essences, there
will be no basis on which to draw the absolute, essential distinctions
necessary to establish phenomena as intrinsically other than their
conditions. Without individual essences there are not substantial
differences. Without substantial differences, there are no absolute
others by means of which to characterize
phenomena.[]{#calibre_link-1273} Third, in order to characterize
phenomena as essentially different from their conditions, it is
important to be able to characterize them independently. Otherwise, each
depends for its identity on the other, and they are not truly distinct
in nature. But the whole point of otherness-essence is that things in
virtue of having it are essentially dependent. So the view is in fact
internally contradictory.[]{#calibre_link-1274} Given that things have
no intrinsic nature, they are not essentially different. Given that lack
of difference, they are interdependent. But given that interdependence,
there cannot be the otherness needed to build otherness-essence out of
dependence.

Now, on the reading of this chapter that I am suggesting, we can see
conditions simply as useful explanans. Using this language,
[]{#calibre_link-346}Nā[]{#calibre_link-1275}gārjuna is urging that even
distinguishing between explanans and explanandum as distinct entities,
with the former containing potentially what the latter has actually, is
problematic. What we are typically confronted with in nature is a vast
network of interdependent and continuous processes, and carving out
particular phenomena for explanation or for use in
explanations[]{#calibre_link-1276} depends more on our explanatory
interests and language than on joints nature presents to us. Through
addressing the question of the potential existence of an event in its
conditions, Nāgārjuna hints at this concealed relation between praxis
and reality.

Next, Nāgārjuna notes[]{#calibre_link-1277} (I: 4) that in invoking an
event or entity as a condition in explanation we do not thereby ascribe
it any causal power:

4\. Power to act does not have conditions.

There is no power to act without conditions.

There are no conditions without power to act.

Nor do any have the power to act.

This is the beginning of Nāgārjuna's attack[]{#calibre_link-1278} on the
causal power/cement-of-the-universe view of causation and his
contrastive development of his regularity view of conditioned dependent
arising. Causal powers, according to those who posit them, are meant to
explain the causal nexus---they are meant to explain how it is that
causes bring about their effects, which is itself supposed to be
otherwise inexplicable. But, Nā[]{#calibre_link-1279}gārjuna argues, if
there were a causal power, it itself, as a phenomenon, would either have
to have conditions or not. If the former, there is a vicious explanatory
regress, for then one has to explain how the powers to act are
themselves brought about by the conditions, and this is the very link
presupposed by the friend of powers to be inexplicable. One could
posit[]{#calibre_link-1280} powers the conditions have to bring about
powers and powers the powers have to bring about effects. But this just
moves one step further down the regress.

If, on the other hand, one suggests that the powers have no condition,
one is stuck positing uncaused and inexplicable occult entities as the
explanans of causation. If what is to be explained is how it is that all
phenomena are brought about[]{#calibre_link-1281} by causal processes,
[]{#calibre_link-342}it is a bit embarrassing to do so by reference to
unobserved entities that are explicitly exempted from this otherwise
universal condition. Moreover, there is then no explanation of how these
powers arise and why they come to be where they are. This is all
startlingly anticipatory of Wittgenstein's famous echo of Hume in the
*Tractatus:*

6.371 The whole modern conception of[]{#calibre_link-1282} the world is
founded on the illusion that the so-called laws of nature are the
explanations of natural phenomena.

6.372 Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as
something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past ages.
And in fact both are right and both are wrong: though the view of the
ancients is clearer in so far as they have a clear and acknowledged
terminus,[]{#calibre_link-1283} while the modern system tries to make it
look as if *everything* were
explained.[]{#calibre_link-599}[^26^](#calibre_link-127){.nounder}

In the next two lines, as we will often see in the text, Nāgārjuna is
speaking in two senses---first, from the conventional standpoint, and
second, from the ultimate. In the third line of the verse, he notes that
conditions can certainly, in a perfectly
legitimate[]{#calibre_link-1284} sense, be appealed to as the things
that bring about their effects; in that sense, we can say that they are
efficacious---that they have the power to act. But in the fourth line he
emphasizes that we cannot, so to speak, quantify over this power,
identifying it as a phenomenon or property possessed by the conditions.
There are no powers in that sense. Just as we can act for someone else's
sake,[]{#calibre_link-1285} despite there being no sakes, we can appeal
to the potency of conditions despite their being no such potency. The
trick is to make correct []{#calibre_link-434}use of conventional
locutions without reifying denotata for all of the terms. For example,
we might ask a farmer, "Do these seeds have the power to sprout?" as a
way of asking whether they are fertile. It would be then perfectly
appropriate for him to answer[]{#calibre_link-1286} in the affirmative.
But if we then asked him to show us where in the seed the power is
located, he would be quite justified in regarding us as
mad.[]{#calibre_link-601}[^27^](#calibre_link-128){.nounder}

Our desire for light does not exert some occult force on the lights. Nor
is there anything to be found in the flicking of the switch other than
the plastic, metal, movement, and connections visible to the naked eye.
Occult causal powers are singularly[]{#calibre_link-1287} absent. On the
other hand, Nāgārjuna points out in this discussion that this does not
mean that conditions are explanatorily impotent. In a perfectly
*ordinary* sense---not the sense that the metaphysicians of causation
have in mind---our desire *is* active in the production of light. But
not in the sense that it contains light potentially,
or[]{#calibre_link-1288} some special causal power that connects our
minds to the bulbs.

What is it, then, about some sets of event pairs (but not others) that
make them dependently related if not some causal link present in those
cases but not in others?

5\. These give rise to those,

So these are
called[]{#calibre_link-602}[^28^](#calibre_link-129){.nounder}
conditions.

As long as those do not come from these.

Why are these not nonconditions?

One might answer this[]{#calibre_link-1289} question, Nāgārjuna notes in
the opponent's suggestion in the first two lines, by noting the presence
of some relation of "giving rise to," realized in a power. But, he
rejoins in the final two lines, this move is blocked: For having shown
the absence and the theoretical impotence of such a link, it would
follow that there would be no[]{#calibre_link-1290} conditions.
Nāgārjuna hence suggests here that it is the regularities that count.
Flickings give []{#calibre_link-300}rise to illuminations. So they are
conditions of them. If they didn't, they wouldn't be. Period.
Explanation relies on regularities. Regularities are explained by
reference to further regularities. Adding active forces or potentials
adds nothing[]{#calibre_link-1291} of explanatory utility to the
picture.[]{#calibre_link-604}[^29^](#calibre_link-130){.nounder}

In reading the next few verses, we must be hermeneutically cautious and
pay careful attention to Nāgārjuna's use of the term "existent" (Tib:
*yod-pa, Skt: sat)* and its negative contrastive "nonexistent" (Tib:
*med-pa, asat)*. For Nāgārjuna[]{#calibre_link-1292} is worried here
about *inherent* existence and *inherent* nonexistence, as opposed to
*conventional* existence or nonexistence. For a thing to exist
inherently is for it to exist in virtue of possessing an essence---for
it to exist independently of other entities and independently of
convention. For a thing to be inherently nonexistent is for it to not
exist in any sense at all---not even
conventionally[]{#calibre_link-1293} or dependently. With this in mind,
we can see how Nāgārjuna defends dependent arising while rejecting
causation:

6\. For neither an existent nor a nonexistent thing

Is a condition appropriate.

If a thing is nonexistent, how could it have a condition?

If a thing is already existent, what would a condition do?

He notes here that if[]{#calibre_link-1294} entities are conceived as
inherently existent, they exist independently and, hence, need no
conditions for their production. Indeed, they could not be produced if
they exist in this way. On the other hand, if things exist in no way
whatsoever, it follows trivially that they have no
conditions.[]{#calibre_link-605}[^30^](#calibre_link-131){.nounder} The
following []{#calibre_link-365}three verses make this point with regard
to each of the four kinds of conditions:

7.[]{#calibre_link-1295} When neither existents nor

Nonexistents nor existent nonexistents are established,

How could one propose a "productive cause?"

If there were one, it would be pointless.

8\. An existent entity (mental
episode)[]{#calibre_link-607}[^31^](#calibre_link-132){.nounder}

Has no object.

Since a mental episode is without an object,

How could there be any percept-condition?

9\. Since things are not arisen.

Cessation is not acceptable.

Therefore, an[]{#calibre_link-1296} immediate condition is not
reasonable.

If something has ceased, how could it be a condition?

In I: 7, Nāgārjuna is reasoning that since an inherently existent
phenomenon is by definition independent, it could not have been produced
by anything else. An inherently nonexistent phenomenon certainly cannot
be produced; if it were, it would[]{#calibre_link-1297} be existent. An
existent nonexistent (for instance, something posited by a Meinongian
ontology---existing in a logical space, though not in the actual world)
cannot be produced since its actual production would contradict its
nonexistence and its production in some other way would contradict the
inherent existence of the other sort posited for it.

The argument in I: 8 is a bit different and is[]{#calibre_link-1298}
directed more specifically at the special status of simultaneous
supporting conditions, such as those posited in perception, as discussed
above. Nāgārjuna is making the following point: If we consider a
particular moment of perception, the object of that perceptual episode
no longer exists. This is so simply because of the mundane
fact[]{#calibre_link-1299} that the chain of events responsible for the
arising of perceptual consciousness takes time. So the tree of which I
am perceptually []{#calibre_link-343}aware now is a tree that existed
about one hundred milliseconds ago; not one that exists now. The light
took some time to reach my eye; the nerve impulses from the eye to the
brain took some time; visual processing took still more time. So if the
story about how the[]{#calibre_link-1300} tree is the percept-object
condition of my perception according to which the tree exists
simultaneously with the perception and exerts a causal power on my eye
or visual consciousness were accepted, perception would be impossible.
Moreover, the objects of many mental episodes are themselves nonexistent
(like the golden mountain). But non-existents can't be causally
responsible for anything.

[]{#calibre_link-1301}Verse 9 contains two arguments. In the first half
of the verse, Nāgārjuna is offering a quick reductio on the idea that
immediately preceding conditions can exist inherently. By definition, an
immediately preceding condition is a momentary element of a causal
chain. And, by definition, something that is inherently existent is
independent;[]{#calibre_link-1302} hence, it cannot arise depending on
something else and, therefore, cannot cease to exist. But immediately
preceding conditions must arise and cease. In the final line of the
verse, Nāgārjuna develops a related problem. Immediately preceding
conditions must cease before their effect arises. If their existence and
exertion of causal power[]{#calibre_link-1303} is what explains the
arising of the cause, the arising of the cause is then inexplicable.
(This argument is also used by Sextus Empiricus in *Against the
Logicians.)*

What is important about this strand of the argument? Nāgārjuna is
drawing attention to the connection between a causal power view of
causation and an essentialist view of[]{#calibre_link-1304} phenomena on
the one hand, and between a condition view of dependent arising and a
conventional view of phenomena on the other. If one views phenomena as
having and as emerging from casual powers, one views them as having
essences and as being connected to the essences of other phenomena.
This, Nāgārjuna suggests, is ultimately incoherent[]{#calibre_link-1305}
since it forces one at the same time to assert the *inherent existence*
of these things, in virtue of their essential identity, and to assert
their *dependence* and *productive* character, in virtue of their causal
history and power. But such dependence and relational character, he
suggests, is incompatible with their inherent existence. If, on the
other hand, one regards things as dependent
[]{#calibre_link-333}merely[]{#calibre_link-1306} on conditions, one
regards them as without essence and without power. And to regard
something as without essence and without power is to regard it as merely
conventionally existent. And this is to regard it as existing
dependently. This provides a coherent mundane understanding of phenomena
as an alternative to the metaphysics of reification that
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1307}rjuna criticizes.

Verse 10 is central in this discussion:

10\. If things did not exist

Without essence,

The phrase, "When this exists so this will be,"

Would not be acceptable.

Nāgārjuna is replying here to the causal realist's inference from the
reality of causal powers to their embodiment in real entities whose
essences include[]{#calibre_link-1308} those powers. He turns the tables
on the realist, arguing that it is precisely because there is no such
reality to things---and hence no entities to serve as the bearers of the
causal powers the realist wants to posit---that the Buddhist formula
expressing the truth of dependent
arising[]{#calibre_link-609}[^32^](#calibre_link-133){.nounder} can be
asserted. It could *not* be asserted if in fact there were real
entities. For if they were real in the sense[]{#calibre_link-1309}
important for the realist, they would be independent. So if the formula
were interpreted in this context as pointing to any causal power, it
would be false. It can only be interpreted, it would follow, as a
formula expressing the regularity of
nature.[]{#calibre_link-610}[^33^](#calibre_link-134){.nounder}

[]{#calibre_link-505}In the next three verses (I: 11--13), Nāgārjuna
anticipates and answers the causal[]{#calibre_link-1310} realist's
reply:

11\. In the several or united conditions

The effect cannot be found.

How could something not in the conditions

Come from the conditions?

Here the realist argues that the conclusion Nāgārjuna draws from the
unreality of causal power---the nonexistence of things (where
"existence" is read "inherent
existence")---entails[]{#calibre_link-1311} the falsity of the claim
that things dependently arise. For if there are no things, surely
nothing arises. This charge has a double edge: If the argument is
successful it not only shows that Nāgārjuna's own position is vacuous,
but that it contradicts one of the most fundamental tenets of Buddhist
philosophy---that all phenomena are dependently[]{#calibre_link-1312}
arisen. Moreover, the opponent charges, on Nāgārjuna's view that the
explanandum is not to be found potentially in the explanans, there is no
explanation of how the former is to be understood as depending upon the
latter. As Nāgārjuna will emphasize in I: 14, however, the
very[]{#calibre_link-1313} structure of this charge contains the seeds
of its reply. The very emptiness of the effect, an effect presupposed by
the opponent to be nonempty, in fact follows from the emptiness of the
conditions and of the relationship between conditions and effect.
Nāgārjuna will, hence, reply to the opponent's attempted refutation by
embracing the[]{#calibre_link-1314} conclusion of his reductio together
with the premises it supposedly refutes.

12\. However, if a nonexistent effect

Arises from these conditions,

Why does it not arise

From nonconditions?

How, the opponent asks, are we to distinguish coincidental sequence from
causal consequence, or even from conventional dependence? And why don't
things simply arise randomly from events that are
nonconditions[]{#calibre_link-1315} since no special connection is
posited to link consequents to their proper causal antecedents?

[]{#calibre_link-429}13. If the effect's essence is the conditions,

But the conditions don't have their own essence,

How could an effect whose essence is the conditions

Come from something that is essenceless?

Finally, the opponent asks, since the phenomena we observe clearly have
natures, and since those natures clearly[]{#calibre_link-1316} derive
from their causes, how could it be, as Nāgārjuna argues, that they
proceed by means of a process with no essence, from conditions with no
essence? Whence do the natures of actual existents arise? Nāgārjuna
again will reply to this last charge by pointing out that
since[]{#calibre_link-1317} on his view the effects indeed have no
essence, the opponent's presupposition is ill-founded. This move also
indicates a reply to the problem posed in I: 12. That problem is
grounded in the mistaken view that a phenomenon's lack of inherent
existence entails that it, being nonexistent, could come into existence
from nowhere. But "from nowhere," for the opponent, means from something
lacking inherent[]{#calibre_link-1318} existence. And indeed, for
Nāgārjuna, this is exactly the case: Effects lacking inherent existence
depend precisely upon conditions that themselves lack inherent
existence.

Nāgārjuna's summary of the import of this set of replies is terse and
cryptic. But unpacking it with the[]{#calibre_link-1319} aid of what has
gone before provides an important key to understanding the doctrine of
the emptiness of causation that is the burden of this chapter:

14\. Therefore, neither with conditions as their essence,

Nor with nonconditions as their essence are there any effects.

If there are no such effects,

How could conditions or nonconditions be evident?

First, Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1320}rjuna points out, the opponent begs the
question in asserting the genuine existence of the effects in question.
They, like their conditions, and like the process of dependent
origination itself, are nonexistent from the ultimate point of view.
That is, they have no essence whatever. Hence, the third charge fails.
As a consequence, in the sense in which the opponent supposes that these
effects proceed[]{#calibre_link-1321} from their conditions---namely
that their essence is contained potentially in their causes, which
themselves []{#calibre_link-310}exist inherently---these effects need
not be so produced. And so, finally, the effect-containing conditions
for which the opponent charges Nāgārjuna with being unable to account
are themselves unnecessary. In short, while the
reificationist[]{#calibre_link-1322} critic charges the Mādhyamika with
failing to come up with a causal link sufficiently robust to link
ultimately real phenomena, for the Mādhyamika philosopher the core
reason for the absence of such a causal link is the very absence of such
phenomena in the first place.

We are now in a position to characterize explicitly the
emptiness[]{#calibre_link-1323} of causation and the way this doctrine
is identical with the doctrine of dependent origination from conditions
adumbrated in this chapter. It is best to offer this characterization
using the via media formulation most consonant with Nāgārjuna's
philosophical school. We will locate the doctrine as a midpoint between
two extreme philosophical[]{#calibre_link-1324} views. That midpoint is
achieved by taking conventions as the foundation of ontology, hence
rejecting the very enterprise of a philosophical search for the
ontological foundations of convention (Garfield 1990). To say that
causation is nonempty, or inherently existent, is to succumb to the
temptation to ground our explanatory practice and discourse in genuine
causal powers linking causes to[]{#calibre_link-1325} effects. That is
the reificationist extreme that Nāgārjuna clearly rejects. To respond to
the arguments against the inherent existence of causation by suggesting
that there is then no possibility of appealing to conditions to explain
phenomena---that there is no dependent origination at all---is the
extreme of nihilism, also clearly rejected[]{#calibre_link-1326} by
Nāgārjuna. To assert the emptiness of causation is to accept the utility
of our causal discourse and explanatory practice, but to resist the
temptation to see these as grounded in reference to causal powers or as
demanding such grounding. Dependent origination simply is the
explicability and coherence of the universe. Its
emptiness[]{#calibre_link-1327} is the fact that there is no more to it
than that.

Keep this analysis in mind, for when we reach [Chapter
XXIV](#calibre_link-63){.nounder}, in which the most explicit analysis
of emptiness itself and of the relation of emptiness to the conventional
world is articulated, we will see that the principal philosophical move
in Nāgārjuna's demystification of emptiness[]{#calibre_link-1328} was
this attack on a reified view of causality. Nāgārjuna replaces the view
shared by the metaphysician and the person in the street, a view that
presents itself as common sense, []{#calibre_link-1329}but is in fact
deeply metaphysical, with an apparently paradoxical, thoroughly empty,
but in the end commonsense view not only of causation, but of the
entire[]{#calibre_link-1330} phenomenal world. This theme---the
replacement of apparent common sense that is deeply metaphysically
committed with an apparently deeply metaphysical but actually
commonsense understanding of the phenomenal world---will recur in each
chapter of the text.

## **[]{#calibre_link-493 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-41 .calibre4}Chapter II  Examination of Motion** {#chapter-ii-examination-of-motion-1 .h1}

The target of Nāgārjuna's arguments in this chapter is any view of
motion according to which motion is an entity, or a property with an
existence independent of that of moving things, or according to which
motion is part of the nature of moving things. These are versions of
what it would be to think of[]{#calibre_link-1333} motion as nonempty.
It might be quite natural for a reificationist to reply to the arguments
in [Chapter I](#calibre_link-40){.nounder} by proposing that such a view
must be the case. For in [Chapter I](#calibre_link-40){.nounder}
Nāgārjuna does presuppose, in developing the view that conventionally
things do arise dependent upon conditions, that there is motion, or
change. For if there were not,[]{#calibre_link-1334} there would be no
arising. And as we have seen, this would indeed be an absurd consequence
for Nāgārjuna. So, one might think, even if the links between conditions
and their consequences are empty, the change represented by the arising
of these consequences must be real.

Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1335}rjuna argues that from such a view a number of
absurd consequences would follow: Things not now in motion, but which
were in motion in the past or which will be in the future, would have to
undergo substantial change, effectively becoming different things when
they change state from motion to rest or vice versa; a regress would
ensue from the need for the entity motion itself to be in motion;
motion[]{#calibre_link-1336} would occur in the absence of moving
things; the moment at which a thing begins or ceases motion would be
[]{#calibre_link-350}indescribable. Nāgārjuna concludes that a
reification of motion is incoherent. Motion is therefore empty.

1\. What has been moved is not moving.

What has not been moved is not moving.

Apart from what has been moved and what has[]{#calibre_link-1337} not
been moved,

Movement cannot be conceived.

That is, if motion exists, there must be sometime at which it exists.
Nāgārjuna in this opening verse considers the past and the future. This
makes good sense. For motion requires a change of position, and a change
of position must occur over time. But the present has no duration. So
if[]{#calibre_link-1338} motion were to exist, it would have to exist
either in the past or in the future. But a thing that has moved only in
the past is not now moving. Nor is a thing yet to be moved. One might,
of course, suggest that there is a simple tense fallacy here---that
things that were moving in the past were *then* in motion, that things
that will move in the future will *then* be in motion. But this would be
problematic.[]{#calibre_link-1339} For that would mean that all motion
would be in the past or in the future, and this could be said at any
time. So there would be no time at which it would be true of any thing
that it is in
motion.[]{#calibre_link-612}[^34^](#calibre_link-136){.nounder} But this
intuition is behind the opponent's reply in the next verse:

2\. Where there is change, there is motion.

Since there is change in the moving,

And not in the moved or not-moved,

Motion is[]{#calibre_link-1340} in that which is moving.

This verse is important not only because it announces the obvious reply
that motion exists in presently moving things, but because it introduces
the connection between change in general and motion. Though this
interpretative point is controversial, and several scholars have given
widely different
interpretations,[]{#calibre_link-613}[^35^](#calibre_link-137){.nounder}
it is []{#calibre_link-390}highly plausible that
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1341}gārjuna is calling attention to the fact that
the attack on motion as an inherently existent phenomenon is a general
attack on seeing change or impermanence as inherently existent. This
suggests that even the properties that according to Buddhist philosophy
characterize all things---being dependently arisen and being
impermanent---are not themselves inherently
existent.[]{#calibre_link-1342} Nāgārjuna replies:

3\. How would it be acceptable

For motion to be in the mover?

When it is not moving, it is not acceptable

To call it a mover.

The point here is that if motion is thought of both as inherently
existent and as a property of the mover, then it should, as inherently
existent, continue to exist. For something that is[]{#calibre_link-1343}
inherently existent depends for nothing on its existence, and so it
cannot be deprived of the conditions of its manifestation. That is
because inherent existence is existence with an essence, as an
independent entity whose identity can be intrinsically specified. (See
[Chapter XV](#calibre_link-54){.nounder} for more detail.) But movers
come to rest. It would seem then that it would have to be appropriate to
call something[]{#calibre_link-1344} a mover, even when it is at rest,
since inherently existing motion could not cease.

4\. For whomever there is motion in the mover,

There could be nonmotion

Evident in the mover.

But having motion follows from being a mover.

[]{#calibre_link-498}In this verse Nāgārjuna begins his attack on the
idea that motion is a property with an existence
independent[]{#calibre_link-1345} of movers. If, he asserts, one were to
posit motion as such a property that simply happened to inhere in
movers, it would follow from its independence that movers might not have
it, but instead its contrary, namely, nonmotion. But that is not
tenable. So it follows that motion can't be thought of as an independent
property. This line of argument is continued in the next two verses:

5\. If motion[]{#calibre_link-1346} is in the mover.

There would have to be a twofold motion:

One in virtue of which it is a mover,

And one in virtue of which it moves.

6\. If there were a twofold motion.

The subject of that motion would be twofold.

For without a subject of motion,

There cannot be motion.

Here Nāgārjuna develops a reductio on a position
according[]{#calibre_link-1347} to which motion is a property of the
mover only at the time that the mover is in motion. This might seem to
be a much more plausible view than the earlier discussed view of motion
as an essential property. But Nāgārjuna argues that this can't work
either. For it involves a multiplication of movements and agents of
motion that is unacceptable[]{#calibre_link-1348} to the proponent of
such a theory. For if the motion is a property of the mover at all, both
the mover and the motion must be moving. And this amounts to two
separate motions. One motion---that in virtue of which the mover is a
mover in the first place---is the motion posited by the theory. But if
that motion were stationary, the mover would either also not be moving
or it would "outrun" its motion[]{#calibre_link-1349} and leave it
behind. So there must also be a motion of the motion. Each of these two
motions requires a subject. They can't be the same subject because then
the mover and the motion would be identical, which would be absurd. So
in explaining the motion of a single individual, the opponent is stuck
with two movers.

This argument clearly can be understood as the start of an infinite
regress. It[]{#calibre_link-1350} is not at all clear whether Nāgārjuna
so intended it, as the context in which the argument is formulated is
one in which []{#calibre_link-521}the consequence that two movers emerge
in the analysis of the motion of a single mover is enough to refute the
opponent.[]{#calibre_link-615}[^36^](#calibre_link-138){.nounder} But it
is important to see that once this multiplication of explanatory motions
and agents begins,[]{#calibre_link-1351} it cannot be stopped, and so
this argument constitutes a perfectly general attack on a view according
to which motion is an entity associated with movers. It is also worth
noting that the argument generalizes in other ways: It can be formulated
as an argument against a parallel analysis of change as an independent
property and, in general, as an argument against properties as entities
that[]{#calibre_link-1352} inhere in subjects---a twofold redness is
required for a red shirt to be red because of the possession of redness.
So this is, in fact, a "third man" argument.

7\. If without a mover

It would not be correct to say that there is motion,

Then if there were no motion,

How could there be a mover?

Nāgārjuna is here emphasizing the codependence[]{#calibre_link-1353} of
motion and the mover. If there are no movers, there is no motion. If
there is no motion, there are no movers. This has import at both the
conventional level and with respect to any discussion of the inherent
existence of either the mover or motion. At the conventional level, it
means that any analysis of either motion or the mover that leaves the
other out, or that does not involve codependence,[]{#calibre_link-1354}
will fail. Neither can be established as an independent basis for the
analysis of the other. But it also means that neither, therefore, can be
thought to inherently exist since to exist inherently would be to exist
independently.

8\. Inasmuch as a real mover does not move,

And a nonmover does not move,

Apart from a mover and a nonmover,

What third thing could move?

[]{#calibre_link-495}Here the terms "mover" and[]{#calibre_link-1355}
"nonmover" must be understood in the context of the previous arguments.
Nāgārjuna is clearly talking about entities that are essentially in
motion or in nonmotion. He has argued that we cannot think of a thing in
motion as a thing whose nature is to move. And clearly a thing whose
nature is not to move cannot be in motion. So if
motion[]{#calibre_link-1356} is thought of as a property that is either
part of the nature of a thing or incompatible with a thing's nature, we
are left with the conclusion that there is no motion. And so we have a
philosophical problem: How is ordinary motion (and change) possible?
Nāgārjuna emphasizes this in the following verses:

9\. When without motion,

It is[]{#calibre_link-1357} unacceptable to call something a mover,

How will it be acceptable

To say that a mover moves?

10\. For him from whose perspective a mover moves,

There would be the consequence that

Without motion there could be a mover.

Because a mover moves.

These verses recapitulate the argument in II: 4 and II: 7. If we simply
regard motion and mover as independent phenomena, we are forced to the
absurd[]{#calibre_link-1358} consequence that either could be present
without the other.

11\. If a mover were to move,

There would be a twofold motion:

One in virtue of which he is a mover,

And one in virtue of which the mover moves.

This last verse recapitulates the important argument in II: 6 in
preparation for the attack on the possibility of the beginning and end
of motion. The next few verses are reminiscent
both[]{#calibre_link-1359} of Zeno of Elea and Sextus Empiricus:

12\. Motion does not begin in what has moved,

Nor does it begin in what has not moved.

Nor does it begin in what is moving.

In what, then, does motion begin?

[]{#calibre_link-469}13. Prior to the beginning of motion,

There is no beginning of motion in

The going or in the gone.

How could there be motion in the not-gone?

These two verses are alternative formulations of
the[]{#calibre_link-1360} same argument: If there is motion, it must
begin sometime. But that moment is inconceivable. For motion doesn't
begin in a stationary thing. And once a thing is in motion, it is too
late. It can't always have begun in the past or be yet to begin, and
there simply isn't time to go anywhere in the present.

14\. Since the beginning of motion

Cannot be conceived in any way.

What gone thing, what[]{#calibre_link-1361} going thing,

And what nongoing thing can be posited?

After having emphasized this point, Nāgārjuna points out that all that
has been said about motion (and hence implicitly about change) applies,
mutatis mutandis, to rest (and hence implicitly to stasis). Things that
are in motion cannot be simultaneously at rest. But to say that
a[]{#calibre_link-1362} stationary thing is at rest, where rest is
conceived as a property or entity having independent existence, would
involve us in the same paradoxes encountered above: The stasis itself
would have to be either in motion or at rest. If in motion, then the
static thing would have to be in motion, which is contradictory. But if
at rest, then it must be at rest in virtue of possessing stasis, and we
are[]{#calibre_link-1363} off on the same regress:

15\. Just as a moving thing is not stationary,

A nonmoving thing is not stationary.

Apart from the moving and the nonmoving,

What third thing is stationary?

16\. If without motion

It is not appropriate to posit a mover,

How could it be appropriate to say

That a moving thing is stationary?

[]{#calibre_link-497}And, in the same fashion, all that applies to the
initiation of motion applies[]{#calibre_link-1364} mutatis mutandis, to
its cessation:

17\. One does not halt from moving,

Nor from having moved or not having moved.

Motion and coming to rest

And starting to move are similar.

Nāgārjuna now develops further problems with any view regarding motion
as an entity; it must be either identical to or different from the
mover. Both options,[]{#calibre_link-1365} he will argue, turn out to be
incoherent:

18\. That motion just is the mover itself

Is not correct.

Nor is it correct that

They are completely different.

19\. It would follow from

The identity of mover and motion

That agent and action

Are identical.

The identity of agent and action is absurd on its face. For then
whenever an agent were to perform another act, s/he would become a
distinct[]{#calibre_link-1366} agent. There would be no basis for
identifying individuals over time.

20\. It would follow from

A real distinction between motion and mover

That there could be a mover without motion

And motion without a mover.

This is more complicated. It is important to recall that the target
positions here are positions that reify motion as a distinct *entity*,
however abstract. If motion were an entity,[]{#calibre_link-1367} and
were distinct from all movers, then it should be possible to separate
motion from
[]{#calibre_link-321}movers.[]{#calibre_link-617}[^37^](#calibre_link-139){.nounder}
Then we should see motion when nothing is moving and movers that are not
in motion. Noticing that this is a problem for Nāgārjuna's opponent
provides us with a hint as to the positive account of conventional
motion that we should take from[]{#calibre_link-1368} this chapter to be
discussed below: Motion can only be understood in relation to
movers---as a relation between their positions at different times.
Movers can only be understood as movers in relation to motion so
understood. But to understand motion and movers this way is not to reify
them as entities---and so to escape the dilemma of their identity or
difference. Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1369}rjuna emphasizes this moral in the
next verse, where we must read "established" as meaning *established as
existent entities*.

21\. When neither in identity

Nor in difference

Can they be established,

How can these two be established at all?

22\. The motion by means of which a mover is manifest

Cannot be the motion by means of which he moves.

He does not exist before that motion,

So what and[]{#calibre_link-1370} where is the thing that moves?

In this verse and in the next, Nāgārjuna is simply emphasizing the
interdependence of motion and the mover. In II: 22 he notes the
absurdity of the supposition that the mover and the motion are known
independently. If they could be, then the mover would have to have one
motion in virtue of which he was[]{#calibre_link-1371} a mover and a
second independent motion in virtue of which he now moves. But since
prior to being in motion, no mover exists, it cannot be that the mover
exists as a mover independently of the motion. This then demands an
answer to the question, What moves?

In II: 23 Nāgārjuna answers this in a very straightforward way: The
mover who[]{#calibre_link-1372} is a mover in virtue of his motion (and
that motion is a motion in virtue of being carried out by a mover) is
what moves. Hence, the mover is dependent for his identity as a mover
[]{#calibre_link-423}on the motion; the motion is dependent for its
identity on the mover. Neither has an intrinsic identity, and both are
empty of inherent existence:

23\. A mover does not carry out a different motion

From that by means[]{#calibre_link-1373} of which he is manifest as a
mover.

Moreover, in one mover

A twofold motion is unacceptable.

24\. A really existent mover

Doesn't move in any of the three ways.

A nonexistent mover

Doesn't move in any of the three ways.

The three ways in question are past, present, and future. Something that
is inherently a mover has been shown to be incapable of motion in any of
these periods. This is simply[]{#calibre_link-1374} a way of emphasizing
the moral of the entire chapter: Movers cannot be thought of as being
movers intrinsically. Moreover, nonexistent movers---movers that are not
even conventionally movers---certainly don't move. It must therefore be
that neither do movers move intrinsically nor that there is no motion.
There must be a sense in which motion and movers exist, but do not do so
intrinsically. The[]{#calibre_link-1375} final verse must hence be read
with "entity," "nonentity," and "existent" as asserted in the ultimate
sense:

25\. Neither an entity nor a nonentity

Moves in any of the three ways.

So motion, mover,

And route are nonexistent.

So far so good. But then is motion completely nonexistent? Is the entire
universe static according to Mādhyamika philosophy? If we
simply[]{#calibre_link-1376} read this chapter in isolation, that
conclusion might indeed seem warranted. It would be hard to distinguish
emptiness from complete nonexistence. We would be left with an illusory
world of change and movement, behind which would lie a static ultimate
reality. But such a reading would be problematic. For one thing, it
would be absurd on its face. Things move and change. For
[]{#calibre_link-496}another, it would contradict[]{#calibre_link-1377}
the doctrine of dependent origination and change that is the very basis
of any Buddhist philosophical system, which Nāgārjuna has already
endorsed in the opening chapter. How, then, are we to read this
discussion more positively? Answering this question is hermeneutically
critical not only for an understanding of this chapter, but
for[]{#calibre_link-1378} a reading of the entire text, which if not
read with care, can appear unrelentingly nihilistic.

The positive account we are after emerges when we read this second
chapter in the context of the first chapter: All phenomena, including
motion, are dependently arisen and, hence, empty of inherent existence.
The conclusion that motion is empty is simply the conclusion that it is
conventional and dependent,[]{#calibre_link-1379} like the putatively
moving entities themselves. Since there is no implicit contrastive,
inherently existent, ultimate reality---say of the static, or of
stasis---this conclusion does not lead us to ascribe a "second class" or
merely apparent existence to motion or to movers. Their nonexistence is
simply their lack of existence as substantial entities. Existence---of a
sort---is hence recovered exactly[]{#calibre_link-1380} in the context
of an absence of inherent existence.

But existence of what kind? Herein lies the clue to the positive
construction of motion that emerges. The existence that emerges is a
conventional and dependent existence. Motion does not exist as an entity
on this account, but rather as a relation---as the relation between the
positions of a body at distinct times and, hence, as dependent
upon[]{#calibre_link-1381} that body and those
positions.[]{#calibre_link-619}[^38^](#calibre_link-140){.nounder}
Moreover, it emerges as a conventional entity in the following critical
sense: Only to the extent that we make the decision to identify, as a
single entity, things that differ from each other in position over time,
but are in other respects quite similar and form causal chains of a
particular sort, can we say that whatever is so identified moves. And
this is a[]{#calibre_link-1382} matter of choice. For we *could* decide
to say that entities that differ in any respect are thereby distinct. If
we did adopt that convention for individuation, an entity here now and
one there then would ipso facto be distinct entities. And so no *single
entity* could adopt different positions (or different properties) at
different times, and so motion and change would be nonexistent. It is
this[]{#calibre_link-1383} dependence of []{#calibre_link-459}motion on
the moved, of the status of things as moved on their motion, and of both
on conventions of individuation that, on this account, constitutes their
emptiness. But this simply constitutes their conventional existence and
provides an analysis of the means by which they so exist. The emptiness
of motion is hence seen to be its existence *as conventional* and *as
dependent*, not[]{#calibre_link-1384} other than its conventional
existence. In understanding its emptiness in this way, we bring motion,
change, and movable and changeable entities back from the brink of
extinction.[]{#calibre_link-621}[^39^](#calibre_link-141){.nounder}

## **[]{#calibre_link-403 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-42 .calibre4}Chapter III  Examination of the Senses** {#chapter-iii-examination-of-the-senses-1 .h1}

In this chapter, which is most immediately about vision, Nāgārjuna
really addresses the status of sense perception generally, as he makes
clear in the opening and closing verses. Just as in [Chapter
II](#calibre_link-41){.nounder}, where the target positions
Nāgārjuna[]{#calibre_link-1387} argues against are positions according
to which motion and the mover inherently exist as distinct, independent,
but somehow related entities, here he argues against positions according
to which the sense faculties, the sense organs, the subject of sensory
experience, and the sense object inherently exist and are distinct,
independent, but somehow related entities. For we do perceive motion and
change,[]{#calibre_link-1388} and the argument for the conventional
existence of motion did suggest that it could be seen as a relation
between the positions at which we perceive objects at different times.
So one can imagine an opponent saying, "Even if the motion we perceive
is not real, the perception must be." Again, it will be important for
Nāgārjuna that his[]{#calibre_link-1389} analysis of perception as empty
of inherent existence, and as merely dependently arisen, does not entail
its complete nonexistence. He must, that is, steer a middle path between
reification and nihilism using emptiness as his compass.

1\. Seeing, hearing, smelling,

Tasting, touching, and mind

Are the six sense faculties.

Their spheres are the visible objects, etc....

[]{#calibre_link-299}This is a standard Buddhist[]{#calibre_link-1390}
catalog of the sense faculties. It differs from the standard Western
catalog only in that the Buddhists regard introspection literally as an
inner sense with the same epistemic structure as outer senses and
presumably subserved by analogous physical structures. Nāgārjuna will
not dispute the reality of these faculties or of their
respective[]{#calibre_link-1391} spheres. But he will insist that that
reality must be characterized interdependently and conventionally.

2\. That very seeing does not see

Itself at all.

How can something that cannot see itself

See another?

This cryptic argument is aimed at any theory according to which vision
is inherently existent. The idea is this: If the visual faculty were to
be inherently existent, then seeing would[]{#calibre_link-1392} be its
essence. Its action would hence require no distinct conditions and no
external object to be seen. That is, if vision were inherently existent,
vision would occur simply in virtue of the existence of the visual
faculty. Suppose then that there is an inherently existent visual
faculty and no external sense object for it. It would then have only
itself as a possible object of sight, yet it would[]{#calibre_link-1393}
be seeing and so would have to be seeing itself. Therefore, Nāgārjuna
argues, a view of vision as inherently existent would entail the
possibility of visual apperception. But there is no such possibility. So
the fact that vision can see other things cannot be in virtue of its
containing percipience as an inherent property.

There is also[]{#calibre_link-1394} a plausible Pyrrhonian
interpretation of this verse: The point of a sensory faculty is to make
knowledge possible. But that is only possible if the data the faculty
provides are themselves perceived. But the data that the visual faculty
delivers are visual. If they themselves are to be perceived, one would
require either another visual faculty, hence generating a vicious
regress, or apperception[]{#calibre_link-1395} by vision, which is
absurd. The point is not then that vision is impossible, but rather that
visual perception---or any kind of perception---can only be completely
explained and characterized by reference to things outside of the visual
faculty []{#calibre_link-356}itself. Vision is relational, and not an
intrinsically identifiable
phenomenon.[]{#calibre_link-623}[^40^](#calibre_link-143){.nounder}

3\. The example of fire

Cannot elucidate seeing.

Along with the moved and[]{#calibre_link-1396} not-moved and motion

That has been answered.

This is a reply to a standard substantialist counterexample to a
Mādhyamika analysis, specifically: Fire burns other things, but does not
burn itself. And it can be intrinsically identified. Perhaps then vision
is like fire, in that it can see others but not itself, while it does
not need to be relationally identified.[]{#calibre_link-1397} This
example is a standard in early Buddhist debates about intrinsic versus
relational identity, and Nāgārjuna devotes an entire chapter to its
refutation as a dialectical device ([Chapter
X](#calibre_link-49){.nounder}), arguing there that fire cannot be
intrinsically identified. But at this point, he is willing to grant the
opponent that premise for the sake of[]{#calibre_link-1398} argument.
For, he claims, its utility as an analogy has already been undermined by
the argument in the second chapter.

How? Whatever fire is burning must be burned in the past, the future, or
the present. But, as with motion, burning cannot be, by its very nature,
in the past, on pain of regress. Nor can it be in the future for the
same reason. But burning cannot take place in the present
either,[]{#calibre_link-1399} for there is not enough time in an instant
for anything to burn. Mutatis mutandis for vision. In the case of
vision, for Nāgārjuna, there is a further problem with vision of another
in the present. The visual process---and any sensory process---takes
time. So if vision is seeing another thing, the other thing is already
past. The only thing[]{#calibre_link-1400} that vision could see in the
present is a visual sense-impression. But then we are back to the
problem of visual apperception. So even if fire were intrinsically
identifiable, there is []{#calibre_link-484}no point at which it could
burn another. And if vision were intrinsically identifiable, there would
be no moment at which it could see another.

4\. When there is not even the slightest

Nonseeing seer,

How could[]{#calibre_link-1401} it makes sense to say

That seeing sees?

When all there is to vision is visual perception, what is the motivation
for positing an entity to undertake the process of perception? All there
is to vision is the perceptual process: We don't need to posit an
entity---the visual faculty over and above the set of interdependent
phenomena that subserve vision. The desire to do so is of a piece with
the[]{#calibre_link-1402} more general substantialist imperative to
posit an independent substratum to support every capacity or property.

5\. Seeing itself does not see.

Nonseeing itself does not see.

Through seeing itself

The clear analysis of the seer is understood.

Perception is not accomplished by any independent entity known as
vision. But that doesn't mean that things that are incapable of sight
thereby perceive.[]{#calibre_link-1403} In order to know what the proper
subject of vision is, it is important to undertake a careful analysis of
the perceptual process and not simply to posit a faculty with the nature
of vision.

6\. Without detachment from vision there is no seer.

Nor is there a seer detached from it.

If there is no seer

How can there be seeing or the seen?

On Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1404}rjuna's analysis, we can't make sense of an
autonomous subject of visual perception. For such a subject would by
definition have its identity as a visual subject independent of
perception. But there is no sense in calling something that does not see
a seer. On []{#calibre_link-526}the other hand, if we pack vision into
its definition, we thereby fail to identify the subject nonrelationally.
Vision and its subject are[]{#calibre_link-1405} thus relational,
dependent phenomena and not substantial or independent entities. So
neither seeing nor seer nor the seen (conceived of as the object of
sense perception) can be posited as entities with inherent existence.
The point is just that sense perception cannot be understood as an
autonomous phenomenon, but only as a dependent process.

7\. Just as the birth of a son is said to occur

[]{#calibre_link-1406}In dependence on the mother and father,

So consciousness is said to arise

In dependence on the eye and material
form.[]{#calibre_link-625}[^41^](#calibre_link-144){.nounder}

Here the opponent offers yet another argument in favor of the inherent
existence of the visual faculty (and, by extension, the other sense
faculties): Consciousness is a consequence of vision, and it surely
exists---in fact, its existence, one might say, is self-validating.
Given[]{#calibre_link-1407} the reality of the effect, the cause must
also be real.[]{#calibre_link-626}[^42^](#calibre_link-145){.nounder}
The final two verses reply to this objection and state the obvious
generalization to all other senses, sense objects, sense faculties, and
faculties of knowledge. The reply consists in pointing out that the
other faculties and aggregates, including introspection and
consciousness, exist and fail to exist in exactly the senses that
vision[]{#calibre_link-1408} and its objects exist and fail to exist:
All are empty of inherent independent existence. But all exist
conventionally. So the effect that, according to this interlocutor,
exists inherently and demands an inherently existent cause does not so
exist. And in the sense that it exists, its causes also exist:

8\. From the nonexistence of seeing and the seen it follows that

The other four faculties[]{#calibre_link-1409} of knowledge do not
exist.

[]{#calibre_link-284}And all the
aggregates,[]{#calibre_link-628}[^43^](#calibre_link-146){.nounder}
etc.,

Are the same way.

9\. Like the seen, the heard, the smelled,

The tasted, and the touched,

The hearer, sound, etc.,

And consciousness should be understood.

Again, the point of this chapter is emphatically not that there is no
perception, or that there are no sense faculties, sense organs, or sense
objects. Rather the point is that[]{#calibre_link-1410} none of these
can be analyzed successfully as autonomous entities. They are
interdependent phenomena that depend for their existence and their
character on each other. None of them exists independently. They are
all, hence, empty of inherent existence, and carving the process of
perception into these components represents a conventional taxonomy of a
process that does not present itself with natural[]{#calibre_link-1411}
joints demanding cleavage on their own.

## **[]{#calibre_link-285 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-43 .calibre4}Chapter IV  Examination of the Aggregates** {#chapter-iv-examination-of-the-aggregates-1 .h1}

The five aggregates are the basic Buddhist categories of personal
constituents. The first---that discussed as an example in this
chapter---is in Sanskrit *rūpa*, in Tibetan *gzugs*. Unfortunately,
given the lexicography of Western philosophy, this word has historically
been translated as "form." This practice is so ubiquitous that I am
loathe[]{#calibre_link-1414} to depart from it, despite the confusion it
engenders. For what the word means is *matter*. The other aggregates are
sensation, perception, intellect, and the dispositions. It is important
to realize that this taxonomy is to be understood pragmatically: There
is no deep doctrinal or philosophical point that hangs on dividing the
properties or capacities of humans up in just this way. In fact,
most[]{#calibre_link-1415} often the only important point about analysis
in terms of the aggregates is that humans are composite. The precise
nature of the best decomposition is of interest to psychology and to
soteriological practitioners, but is at bottom, from the standpoint of
the tradition, an empirical
matter.[]{#calibre_link-630}[^44^](#calibre_link-148){.nounder}

This chapter is motivated by the natural suggestion that even if vision
itself is empty, as was argued[]{#calibre_link-1416} in the previous
chapter, there must be a truly existent basis for vision in the person
and his/her faculties. For the emptiness of vision was established in
part by showing that perception depends upon the perceiver and the
perceived. []{#calibre_link-447}And that might seem to suggest that
these bases---or at least the most essential one, the perceiver---truly
exist. For then one could say that whereas vision
itself[]{#calibre_link-1417} is not inherently existent, it does exist
as a relation between an inherently existent perceiver and an inherently
existent object, or at least as a property of such a perceiver, even if
there is truly no
object.[]{#calibre_link-632}[^45^](#calibre_link-149){.nounder}
Nāgārjuna aims to demonstrate the emptiness of all of the constituents
of the person by taking form as an example and
applying[]{#calibre_link-1418} arguments that are general in scope. Form
is taken as an example precisely because it is the most solid,
apparently nonempty of the aggregates---the one that we are most likely
to reify. So the program is to use arguments with application to any of
the aggregates and to apply them to the hardest case. The conclusion
Nāgārjuna is after is[]{#calibre_link-1419} that no decomposition of the
person will yield constituents that are themselves independent and
nonempty.

1\. Apart from the cause of form,

Form cannot be conceived.

Apart from form,

The cause of form is not seen.

Nāgārjuna begins by making use of the results of the first chapter.
Nothing arises causelessly, and no cause is
ineffectual.[]{#calibre_link-1420} So if any form exists, it exists with
a cause. And if the cause of any form exists, so does that form. But
there is an interesting problem to be posed: How about form
itself---matter considered in general, not in its specific instances?
Does it have a cause or not? This question is important because it gets
at the question of whether we can imagine ultimate ontological
categories that exist independently.[]{#calibre_link-1421} If form has a
cause at all, it must be either the same or different from form. If the
former, we have an infinite regress. If the latter, then we have the
absurd conclusion that immaterial things can cause material things to
come into []{#calibre_link-540}existence. If it has no cause, then it
cannot be said to exist at
all.[]{#calibre_link-634}[^46^](#calibre_link-150){.nounder}

2\. If apart from the cause of form, there were form,

Form would be without cause.

But[]{#calibre_link-1422} nowhere is there an effect

Without a cause.

If form as such exists without any cause, we would have an example of an
inherently existent category. But that would also violate the principle
of dependent origination. That is, both Nāgārjuna and his opponent agree
that all phenomena are dependently originated, and the discussion in
the[]{#calibre_link-1423} present chapter is in fact directed at
figuring out just what material form depends on. So an attempt to posit
material form as inherently existent on the grounds that it comes into
existence causelessly is an ad hoc move that is unavailable to any
participant in this debate.

Moreover, Nāgārjuna points out in the next verse, if we
held[]{#calibre_link-1424} form to be dependent upon a cause that was
itself inherently existent, we would have an inherently existing cause
without an inherently existing effect. That putative cause would, hence,
fail to be a cause in the full sense. Between genuine causes and their
effects there is a relation of dependence. For something to count as a
cause independent of its producing an effect would be incoherent.
But[]{#calibre_link-1425} since in the context of inherent existence
merely conventional existence counts as no existence at all, an
inherently existent cause with a merely conventionally existent effect
would count just as much as an ineffective cause. So neither can we make
sense of an inherently existent cause of the existence of material form
if material form is held not to be inherently existent.

[]{#calibre_link-445}3. If apart from[]{#calibre_link-1426} form

There were a cause of form,

It would be a cause without an effect.

But there are no causes without effects.

4\. When form exists,

A cause of the arising of form is not tenable.

When form is nonexistent,

A cause of the arising of form is not tenable.

Any relationship between form and a putative cause is unintelligible,
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1427}rjuna argues, following closely the reasoning
in [Chapter I](#calibre_link-40){.nounder}. If form exists, the cause
has ceased to exist. If form does not exist, the cause cannot have
existed. This might seem at first glance to be a wholesale rejection of
the possibility of dependency of effects on causal conditions. But if we
recall the moral of [Chapter I](#calibre_link-40){.nounder} and keep the
dialectical context of the current chapter firmly in
mind[]{#calibre_link-1428} we will see that this is not so: The paradox
of causal contact arises---as Sextus also notes---only if we suppose
that the causes we appeal to in explanation must have some special force
by means of which they bring about their effects. That, as we have seen,
is the view of the causal link as inherently existent and, hence, of
causes as inherently existent. The opponent
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1429}gārjuna is attacking in this chapter is one who
thinks that form/matter is inherently existent, but who has granted that
all individual phenomena---all particular forms, such as human bodies,
tables, and chairs---are dependently arisen. So the opponent agrees that
all phenomena must be explicable. But the opponent wants to reify form,
and that is to treat it as a phenomenon---albeit[]{#calibre_link-1430}
an inherently existent one. Therefore, it must, for the opponent, have
an explanation of its existence, and since its existence is inherent
existence, it must be an explanation in terms of inherently existent
causation. So all that Nāgārjuna has to do is to remind the opponent of
the incoherence of *that* notion in order to undermine
the[]{#calibre_link-1431} view that form as such is inherently existent.
The coherence of conventional dependent origination is not at issue.

5\. Form itself without a cause

Is not possible or tenable.

[]{#calibre_link-473}Therefore, think about form, but

Do not construct theories about form.

The moral of these arguments, Nāgārjuna concludes, is that we cannot
think of form as[]{#calibre_link-1432} such as an entity at all.
Individual forms are entities---dependently arisen ones, hence, empty of
inherent existence. But form itself is an abstraction, neither caused
nor uncaused, but dependent upon the existence of material things with
form. (Moreover, were one to argue that form itself exists as an entity,
one would be faced with an uncomfortable dilemma: Its existence would be
caused or uncaused.[]{#calibre_link-1433} The latter alternative
patently begs the question regarding the explanation of the existence of
the material world. But the former issues in a further dilemma: The
cause would either itself be material or immaterial. On the first horn,
we have an infinite regress; on the second, the inexplicable causation
of the material by the
immaterial.)[]{#calibre_link-636}[^47^](#calibre_link-151){.nounder} So,
he advises, think carefully about what form is[]{#calibre_link-1434} and
about the nature of particular material objects. But do not construct
theories that purport to describe the essence of material form. For
there is no such thing. It is simply a characteristic of individual
material objects and, hence, something that depends upon their
existence, with no essence of its own.

6\. The assertion that the effect and cause are similar

Is not acceptable.

The assertion[]{#calibre_link-1435} that they are not similar

Is also not acceptable.

We cannot say that nonmaterial things give rise to the existence of
matter, for that would be an inexplicable miracle. Nor can we say that
matter gives rise to matter, since that would beg the question. But
there is no other possibility. So despite the reificationist's intuition
that though individual material objects may be empty, the
matter[]{#calibre_link-1436} they are made of is nonempty, we see that
we cannot even clearly conceive of the nature of matter as such
independently of material objects. Matter, too, is hence dependent and
empty of []{#calibre_link-441}inherent existence. Nāgārjuna immediately
generalizes this to the other aggregates:

7\. Feelings, discriminations and dispositions

And consciousness[]{#calibre_link-1437} and all such things

Should be thought of

In the same way as material form.

8\. When an analysis is made through emptiness,

If someone were to offer a reply,

That reply will fail, since it will presuppose

Exactly what is to be proven.

9\. When an explanation is made through emptiness,

Whoever would find fault with it

Will find no fault, since the criticism will presuppose

Exactly what is[]{#calibre_link-1438} to be proven.

In these last two oft-quoted verses, Nāgārjuna claims that once a
demonstration of the emptiness of a phenomenon or class of phenomena has
been produced, any reply will inevitably beg the question. And this is
meant to have been demonstrated by the argument in this chapter in the
following way: Once we have shown something[]{#calibre_link-1439} to be
empty of inherent existence, we have, ipso facto, shown it to be
dependently arisen and merely conventionally real. Anything an opponent
would want to demonstrate to be inherently existent would fall prey to
the causal paradoxes developed in this chapter. That is, he must either
assume that the thing is completely independent and causeless, which is,
upon analysis, exactly equivalent to[]{#calibre_link-1440} the
conclusion he is out to prove, or that it arises from another inherently
existent phenomenon. But then in order to demonstrate that fact, he must
demonstrate the inherent existence of that second phenomenon (as well as
the inherent dependence relation between them---a kind of relation we
have seen to be internally contradictory). And this is true no matter to
which ontological category the putatively[]{#calibre_link-1441}
inherently existent phenomenon belongs.

That this is so should not be surprising, for the central thrust of
Nāgārjuna's arguments thus far, and throughout *Mūlamadhyama-kakārikā*,
is not that inherent existence is a property some things might have had
but[]{#calibre_link-1442} by global accident is uninstantiated or that
[]{#calibre_link-475}emptiness just happens to characterize all
phenomena. Rather he is arguing that inherent existence is simply an
incoherent notion and that emptiness is the only possible analysis of
existence. It would follow straightforwardly that arguments for inherent
existence will be question
begging.[]{#calibre_link-638}[^48^](#calibre_link-152){.nounder}

## **[]{#calibre_link-354 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-44 .calibre4}Chapter V  Examination of Elements** {#chapter-v-examination-of-elements-1 .h1}

This chapter examines the ontological status of characteristics and the
characterized, or in more familiar terms, properties and individuals.
The question, as always, is this: Does it make sense to think of either
as existing independently, substantially, or fundamentally? Or, on the
other hand, are they mutually interdependent and therefore empty? The
example[]{#calibre_link-1445} Nāgārjuna chooses to focus on is space
since it is one of the six primal elements according to classical
Buddhist
cosmology.[]{#calibre_link-640}[^49^](#calibre_link-154){.nounder} If he
can show that these elements must be understood as neither inherently
existing entities nor as inherently existing characteristics of
entities, he will have shown that no ontological decomposition of
phenomena[]{#calibre_link-1446} into their primary constituents yields
inherently existing constituents. Moreover, according to some early
Buddhist schools, each of the primal elements has a distinguishing
characteristic and, hence, an essence. So, Nāgārjuna is addressing his
opponent on the opponent's home turf. If any entities or characteristics
have essences, these[]{#calibre_link-1447} do.

1\. Prior to a
characteristic[]{#calibre_link-641}[^50^](#calibre_link-155){.nounder}
of space

There is not the slightest space.

[]{#calibre_link-1448}If it arose prior to the characteristic

Then it would, absurdly, arise without a characteristic.

Space cannot exist as a completely uncharacterized entity that then
somehow acquires characteristics. Anything that exists has some
properties and cannot be identified or characterized independently of
them.

2\. A thing[]{#calibre_link-1449} without a characteristic

Has never existed.

If nothing lacks a characteristic,

Where do characteristics come to be?

So we can conclude that everything has characteristics. But maybe these
characteristics exist inherently, independently of the things, and then
come to be associated with them. On such a view, while individuals would
not have inherent existence, properties would.

3\. Neither[]{#calibre_link-1450} in the uncharacterized nor in the
characterized

Does a characteristic arise.

Nor does it arise

In something different from these two.

But there is a problem. If a characteristic were inherently existent, it
would have to become instantiated in either a characterized or an
uncharacterized object. But there are no uncharacterized objects, and if
the object already is characterized, there is[]{#calibre_link-1451} no
need for the characteristic to become instantiated. So to think of
individuals and properties as existing independently and then somehow
coming together to constitute particulars makes no sense.

4\. If characteristics do not appear,

Then it is not tenable to posit the characterized object.

If the characterized object is not posited,

There will be no characteristic either.

But if we were[]{#calibre_link-1452} to go completely eliminativist with
respect to characteristics, we would lose the ability to posit both
actual objects []{#calibre_link-523}with characteristics and
characteristics that actual objects share.

5\. From this it follows that there is no characterized

And no existing characteristic.

Nor is there any entity

Other than the characterized and the characteristic.

In the first two lines of this verse, Nā[]{#calibre_link-1453}gārjuna
draws the conclusion that there are no inherently existent
characteristics and no inherently existent characterized entities.
Entities and their properties are mutually dependent and, hence, empty
of inherent existence. But this does not mean, he emphasizes in the
final two lines, that there is some other ontology of inherently
existent basic types that could[]{#calibre_link-1454} replace them.
Indeed particulars can be thought of as characterized entities, with
characteristics; but this does not entail the independent existence of
entities of either of those types.

6\. If there is no existent thing,

Of what will there be nonexistence?

Apart from existent and nonexistent things

Who knows existence and nonexistence?

Here Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1455}rjuna generalizes the conclusion and
indicates its larger ontological implications. Having shown that there
are no inherently existent things, it might seem that it follows that
all things are inherently nonexistent. But existence and nonexistence,
after all, are characteristics. So it follows that neither existence nor
nonexistence can be said to exist independently and hence to
characterize,[]{#calibre_link-1456} inherently, anything. Moreover,
since no particulars can be said inherently to exist, and thereby
characterized as inherently existing things, none can be said to be
inherently nonexistent. Existence and nonexistence are hence themselves
dependent, relative characteristics. It is, of course, important to
recall that this entire dialectic is aimed at nonrelative understandings
of existence and nonexistence.[]{#calibre_link-1457} Nāgārjuna is not
arguing that nothing exists in any sense and that nothing fails to exist
in any sense. Rather, he is arguing that nothing exists in virtue of
instantiating an independently []{#calibre_link-384}existent property of
existence. Similarly, things do not fail to exist in virtue of
instantiating the property nonexistence.

7\. Therefore, space[]{#calibre_link-1458} is not an entity.

It is not a nonentity.

Not characterized, not without character.

The same is true of the other five elements.

Nāgārjuna now returns to the example at hand to sum up the conclusions
of the chapter. Things cannot be analyzed ontologically as particulars
existing independently of their properties. But this does
not[]{#calibre_link-1459} mean that individual things do not exist. They
do not possess independently existing properties. But this does not mean
that things are all propertyless.

8\. Fools and reificationists who perceive

The existence and nonexistence

Of objects

Do not see the pacification of objectification.

This is the soteriological import of this discussion of fundamental
ontology: If one reifies phenomena---including[]{#calibre_link-1460}
such things as one's own self, characteristics (prominently including
one's own), or external objects---and if one thinks that things either
fail to exist or exist absolutely, one will be unable to attain any
peace. For one will thereby be subject to egoism, the overvaluing of
oneself and one's achievements and of material things. One will not
appreciate the possibility of change, of the
impermanence[]{#calibre_link-1461} and nonsubstantiality of oneself and
one's possessions. These are the seeds of grasping and craving and,
hence, of suffering. The alternative, Nāgārjuna suggests, and the path
to pacification, is to see oneself and other entities as
non-substantial, impermanent, and subject to change and not as
appropriate objects of such passionate craving.

## **[]{#calibre_link-400 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-45 .calibre4}Chapter VI  Examination of Desire and the Desirous** {#chapter-vi-examination-of-desire-and-the-desirous-1 .h1}

This chapter represents a continuation of the discussion begun in the
previous one. That is, while the chapter is nominally about desire, an
example chosen for its obvious soteriological significance, it is in a
larger sense a further discussion of the relation between entities and
their properties, with specific attention to the relation
between[]{#calibre_link-1465} human beings and their psychological
characteristics. Locating the discussion at this point is consonant with
a tradition of Mahāyāna discussions of emptiness in which one first
addresses external phenomena, which are both easier to analyze and less
succeptible of reification than the self, and then generalizes the
discussion to human[]{#calibre_link-1466} psychological
phenomena.[]{#calibre_link-643}[^51^](#calibre_link-157){.nounder} The
chapter opens with an echo of the discussion of space:

1\. If prior to desire

And without desire there were a desirous one,

Desire would depend on him.

Desire would exist when there is a desirous one.

[]{#calibre_link-1467}One possibility for the relationship between the
subject of desire and the desire is that the desirous one exists qua
desirous one independently of the desire,[]{#calibre_link-1468} which is
then adventitious and dependent. That is, on this view the desirous one
is inherently desirous, but the desire is merely dependent. This,
however, is problematic, for then there is a real contrast in the mode
of existence of the desirous one and the desire: The desirous one truly
exists, but the desire does not truly exist. But if there is no real
desire, in virtue of what is there a desirous[]{#calibre_link-1469} one?

2\. Were there no desirous one, moreover,

Where would desire occur?

Whether or not desire or the desirous one exist.

The analysis would be the same.

But if there is no desirous one, there is no ontological basis for the
desire. So whether we posit an inherently existent desirous one or no
desirous one at all, we cannot identify desire as existing. And, of
course, this goes for any characteristic[]{#calibre_link-1470} or
psychological attribute and for any subject of any such attribute
identified under any description. Moreover, the converse is also true:
Whether or not we posit inherently existent desire, we cannot thereby
establish the existence of a substantially existent desirous one. If the
desire does not exist inherently but only dependently, that dependence
in no way presupposes an independent[]{#calibre_link-1471} basis. If on
the other hand desire is posited as inherently existent, there would be
no need for a basis in a desirous one at all. In neither case would the
substantial existence of the entity in question (subject or attitude)
have any import for the reality of the correlative entity (attitude or
subject). And the reason for this is simply that inherent existence is
not relational existence. Since[]{#calibre_link-1472} desire and the
desirous one must be understood as interrelated, they must be understood
as mutually dependent.

3\. Desire and the desirous one

Cannot arise together.

In that case, desire and the desirous one

Would not be mutually contingent.

[]{#calibre_link-305}Another possibility the opponent might suggest is
this: Desire and the desirous one come into inherent existence at the
same time. It is very important[]{#calibre_link-1473} in following this
argument to remember Nāgārjuna's dialectical task. The opponent against
whom his reductios are aimed is one who attributes inherent existence
either to the desirous one, to desire, or both. Nāgārjuna is only
attempting to show that attributing to them that
kind[]{#calibre_link-1474} of existence is incoherent---not that there
is no desire and that there are no desirous people at all. That would be
crazy. Fundamental to the Buddhist conception of the predicament of
human existence is the centrality of craving to the arising of
suffering. But also fundamental is the conviction that there can be a
release from craving. That is only possible, however, if craving is
dependently[]{#calibre_link-1475} originated since only then could the
conditions that determine its arising be eliminated. So it is critically
important from a Buddhist perspective to come to a complete
understanding of the nature of desire, and the mode of its existence,
and it would be inconceivable to deny its existence completely. But
Nāgārjuna is emphasizing here[]{#calibre_link-1476} that that
understanding must reveal them as mutually dependent in order to avoid
the absurd conclusion that either could exist without the other. That
precludes the assertion that while they in fact always co-occur, that
co-occurrence is not through interdependence, but through contingent
simultaneity of independent phenomena.

Nāgārjuna's[]{#calibre_link-1477} claim in VI: 3 is also the conclusion
of the argument that is about to follow. It proceeds by means of a
destructive dilemma. Given that the opponent must have desire and the
desirous one arising simultaneously, they must be either identical or
different. Nāgārjuna will show that neither alternative is coherent; VI:
4 spells out this[]{#calibre_link-1478} strategy:

4\. In identity there is no simultaneity.

A thing is not simultaneous with itself.

But if there is difference,

Then how would there be simultaneity?

In the first line of this verse, Nāgārjuna points out the relational
character of simultaneity. If simultaneity is predicated, it must be
predicated of two distinct things that[]{#calibre_link-1479} arise at
the same time. We []{#calibre_link-452}don't say that a thing arises
simultaneously with itself. But if things are completely distinct in
nature, they cannot co-occur in the same place, that is, if desire and
the desirous one had distinct essences, they could not be in the same
place at the same time.

5\. If in identity there were simultaneity,

Then it could occur without association.

If in difference there[]{#calibre_link-1480} were simultaneity,

It could occur without association.

The first claim is meant to be a reductio on the view that simultaneous
things can be identical. For suppose that there was an apparent pair of
events whose simultaneity was in question, say William Clinton's
uttering of the oath of office of the presidency and the inauguration of
the first president from Arkansas. If there is every
reason[]{#calibre_link-1481} to believe that these events are distinct
but occur at the same time, it is then appropriate to say that they are
simultaneous. But if we know that there is in fact only one event, it is
at best a joke to assert its simultaneity with itself. The proper thing
to say then would be not that the oath taking was simultaneous with the
inauguration but that it was identical to the inauguration. The
term[]{#calibre_link-1482} translated as "association" here *(grogspa)*
can also mean friendship, or companionship---the idea is of something
distinct but accompanying. For the inauguration and the oath taking to
be associated would be for them to be, say, accompanying rituals that
could in principle occur independently. But if they could occur
independently, they cannot be identical. Simultaneity requires
association of some[]{#calibre_link-1483} kind. But identity is
incompatible with association.

The second claim is meant to be a reductio on the view that simultaneous
and associated things could be different in nature. Difference, like
identity, is incompatible with association, though for a different
reason. The kind of difference at issue here is essential difference.
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1484}rjuna's claim is that things that are
completely different from one another, that are completely independent,
ipso facto, stand in no relation to one another and so are not
associated. This is another application of the Humean (and Tractarian)
argument Nāgārjuna has mobilized above: If phenomena are
[]{#calibre_link-1485}distinct---indeed, being
simultaneous,[]{#calibre_link-1486} they are not even argued to be
causally related---they can be imagined to be separate. So they are then
logically independent. But that would then entail that if desire and the
desirous one were different in this strong sense, we could imagine a
desirous one without desire, and vice versa. But that is of course
absurd. So if desire and the desirous one are supposed to arise
simultaneously, they can[]{#calibre_link-1487} neither be identical nor
different. Of course, since any inherently different entities, in virtue
of having determinate natures, are either identical or different, it
follows that desire or the desirous one are either nonsimultaneous or
empty of inherent existence.

6\. If in difference there were simultaneity,

How could desire and the desirous one,

Being different, be established?

If they were,[]{#calibre_link-1488} they would be simultaneous.

This last verse emphasizes and spells out the point scouted above: We
are left with a hard choice once we conceive of desire and the desirous
one as entities. If desire and the desirous one are conceived as
substantially different but simultaneous, we would have to be able to
establish the nature and existence of each independent of the other.
That is no easy task.[]{#calibre_link-1489} If we could accomplish it,
simultaneity would be a satisfactory solution to the dilemma. But of
course we cannot. Moreover, Nāgārjuna argues in the next verse, if they
are completely different, we are left with the peculiar task of
explaining why they always go together. And asserting their simultaneity
forces this problem:

7\. If desire[]{#calibre_link-1490} and the desirous one

Are established as different,

Then why would you think

That they are simultaneous?

8\. Since difference is not established,

If you assert that they are simultaneous,

Since they are established as simultaneous,

Do you also assert that they are different?

[]{#calibre_link-1491}We have not established---nor could we---that
desire and the desirous one are substantially different. But the
opponent[]{#calibre_link-1492} wishes to assert their simultaneity.
Given the entailment of difference by simultaneity as per the argument
above, this would force the opponent to assume the impossible burden of
demonstrating this substantial difference.

The whole quandary is summed up in VI: 9. Since we can't establish their
difference in entity, we can't establish the claim that desire and the
desirous one arise as distinct,[]{#calibre_link-1493} simultaneous
phenomena. We don't even have two phenomena to serve as the relata of
difference:

9\. Since nothing different has been established,

If one is asserting simultaneity,

Which different thing

Do you want to say is simultaneous?

The conclusion, as stated in the special case in the preceding verse, is
generalized in the final verse of the chapter. Once we think of entities
and their[]{#calibre_link-1494} properties---in particular, ourselves
and our characteristics---as independently characterized things, we can
make no sense of how they fit together temporally, logically, or
ontologically. It is important that objects and their characteristics,
persons and their states, be unified. But if we introduce essence and
entity into our ontology, this will be impossible:

10\. Thus desire and the desirous[]{#calibre_link-1495} one

Cannot be established as simultaneous or not simultaneous.

So, like desire, nothing whatever

Can be established either as simultaneous or as nonsimultaneous.

As always, however, we must remind ourselves of the sense of the
conclusion and of its dialectical context. There is no denial here of
the possibility of simultaneity, of the existence of desire, or of the
possibility of desirous[]{#calibre_link-1496} persons. Rather, there is
a denial that any of these things make sense in the context of inherent
existence.

## **[]{#calibre_link-394 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-46 .calibre4}Chapter VII  Examination of the Conditioned** {#chapter-vii-examination-of-the-conditioned-1 .h1}

Having begun the text with an examination of the relation of dependency
between phenomena, and having then conducted an analysis of the
fundamental ontological constituents of reality, Nāgārjuna now brings
these two analyses together in a long chapter investigating the nature
of the world of[]{#calibre_link-1499} conditioned things as a whole. The
target position is the view that dependent arising itself, as well as
dependently arisen things, are either inherently existent or completely
nonexistent. There are really two positions here with which Nāgārjuna
must contend: First, the reificationist opponent charges that even if we
grant Nā[]{#calibre_link-1500}gārjuna's earlier arguments for the
conclusion that phenomena themselves are empty because they are
dependently arisen, dependent arising itself must inherently exist. For
only if phenomena are truly dependently arisen, one might argue, are
they truly empty. Second, Nāgārjuna must answer the following
objection:[]{#calibre_link-1501} If dependent arising is empty, then
arising, stasis, and cessation are nonexistent. Hence there are, in
fact, no phenomena since phenomena are defined---particularly in a
Buddhist context---as those things that arise, remain, and cease. But
clearly there are actual empirical phenomena; indeed, such phenomena
must exist for Nāgārjuna's claim[]{#calibre_link-1502} that they are
empty to make any sense at all. How can this be reconciled with the
emptiness of dependent arising?

[]{#calibre_link-395}1. If arising were
produced[]{#calibre_link-645}[^52^](#calibre_link-159){.nounder}

Then it would also have the three characteristics.

If arising is not produced,

How could the characteristics of the produced exist?

The three characteristics in question are arising, stasis, and
cessation. On a standard Buddhist view, all
phenomena[]{#calibre_link-1503} come into being in dependence upon
conditions, remain in existence dependent upon conditions, and cease to
exist dependent upon conditions. This is the core of the two central
doctrines of dependent arising and impermanence. Nāgārjuna here poses a
problem: If dependent arising itself were produced by conditions, then
it itself would have[]{#calibre_link-1504} these three characteristics
and, apparently paradoxically, be impermanent. This is prima facie
paradoxical just because if dependent arising is impermanent, it would
appear that sometimes things don't arise dependently, which contradicts
the thesis that all phenomena are dependently arisen. Moreover, as
Nāgārjuna will argue below, this[]{#calibre_link-1505} assertion
threatens a vicious regress---if arising arises, there must already be
arising in virtue of which it does so.

But, Nāgārjuna asks in the third and fourth lines, if dependent arising
is not produced, where did it come from? If one were to say that
dependent arising were not produced and, hence, that it does not depend
for its[]{#calibre_link-1506} existence on anything else, this would
appear to contradict the thesis that *everything* arises dependently.
Dependent arising itself would then be the counterexample to the thesis.

2\. If the three, arising, etc., are separate,

They cannot function as the characteristics of the produced.

But how could they be joined

In one thing simultaneously?

[]{#calibre_link-1507}These three characteristics, if they
characterize[]{#calibre_link-1508} the phenomenon of dependent arising
itself, must either be present separately or together. This furnishes
the basis of a destructive dilemma. If they are separate, then some
parts of dependent arising have one of the three; some another. Some are
arising; some abiding; some ceasing. But this is problematic since all
phenomena are said to arise, to abide, and to
cease.[]{#calibre_link-647}[^53^](#calibre_link-160){.nounder} So it
would seem to be[]{#calibre_link-1509} the case that if dependent
arising itself has all three of these characteristics, it cannot have
them separately, but must have them jointly and simultaneously.

But the three characteristics could not be present simultaneously since
they are mutually contradictory. At any one point, dependent arising
could have only one of them. The same thing cannot be---in the same
sense, at the same time---arising[]{#calibre_link-1510} and ceasing when
these are understood in the sense at issue here, that introduced by the
substantialist opponent. It is important in order to understand this
argument to keep the dialectical context firmly in mind. The opponent
throughout the text, whether on the nihilist side or on the
reificationist side, considers existence to be inherent existence and
predication to be the ascription of really[]{#calibre_link-1511}
existent properties to substantial bases. For the opponent Nāgārjuna has
in mind here, dependent arising---if it is the nature of things at
all---must inherently exist. It must therefore have the three
characteristics inherently. To have a characteristic inherently is to
have it essentially. But then dependent arising, for the opponent,
would[]{#calibre_link-1512} have a contradictory set of essential
properties.

[]{#calibre_link-1513}3. If arising, abiding, and ceasing

Have characteristics other than those of the produced,

There would be an infinite regress.

If they don't, they would not be produced.

The other possibility is that dependent arising has some other
characteristics---that is, characteristics other than those that all
phenomena have in virtue of being dependently[]{#calibre_link-1514}
arisen. But we could then ask about the characteristics of those
characteristics. Do those characteristics arise, abide, or perish? If
so, the original regress has not been stopped. Another possibility is
that arising, abiding, and perishing do not have characteristics at all.
But if not, then they are not phenomena in any ordinary sense at all.
While that would cut off the regress, it would[]{#calibre_link-1515} do
so without achieving any explanation, or any analysis of the kind
originally sought, and would leave an uncomfortable paradox: We started
seeking an understanding of dependent arising as inherently existent.
But its inherent existence requires the inherent existence of arising,
cessation, and stasis, all of which now come out to be ontologically sui
generis. The further paradox is this: For
dependent[]{#calibre_link-1516} arising to exist inherently, these three
should turn out to be essential properties of all phenomena. But on the
alternative under consideration, they are not properties at all.

We might, of course, try to extend this horn of the dilemma by
suggesting that although arising, abiding, and ceasing are not phenomena
in the ordinary sense, they are characteristics of some special kind. We
then seem[]{#calibre_link-1517} to have a more curious regress; new ad
hoc characteristics arise at each level of analysis. The regress here is
an interesting one because its viciousness consists not in the same
basis being required for each putatively basic posit, but in there being
no principle available to determine a basis for any putative basic posit
despite a principle that urges that there must be one. The point that
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1518}gārjuna is after, of course, is that this
principle itself---that there must be an explanatory basis, an
independent entity that has characteristics, as an explanation of the
occurrence of any characteristic---is what generates the regress and
must be rejected.

There is, of course, a third alternative. These three might neither have
characteristics different from those[]{#calibre_link-1519} possessed by
ordinary phenomena nor have no characteristics at all: They might
[]{#calibre_link-293}indeed have the very trio of characteristics that
all ordinary phenomena have, namely, arising, abiding, and ceasing. It
is this alternative that occupies Nāgārjuna for the remainder of the
chapter. This alternative is interesting dialectically in that,
on[]{#calibre_link-1520} the one hand, it represents the most natural
way to approach an analysis of dependent arising, namely, by
consistently predicating it of everything, hence suggesting that it is
indeed a candidate for an essence of things. On the other hand, as we
shall see, that very move precludes treating it as a genuine essence
since essences turn out to lack precisely the properties that we must
universalize here.

4\. The arising of arising only gives rise

To the basic arising.

The arising of the basic arising

Gives rise to arising.

This is the opponent speaking. He suggests that dependent arising arises
from a more basic arising. This basic arising comes to be, but not on
the basis of anything else. The idea, defended by some earlier Buddhist
schools, is this: There are two levels of dependent
arising.[]{#calibre_link-1522} The more superficial is the relationship
of mutual dependence of all phenomena, issuing in their impermanence.
But this interdependence, on this view, is itself dependently arisen. It
depends on a basic arising---a mere fact of interdependent origination,
which gives rise to the more specific empirical relations we see. So in
the first two lines of this verse, the opponent says that when
arising[]{#calibre_link-1523} itself is considered in isolation, all
that we have is the basic arising. In the third and fourth lines, the
opponent says that when that arising has arisen, it gives rise to the
more superficial ordinary dependent arising. It is, then, that basic
arising that is posited as ontologically foundational.

5\. If, as you say, the arising of arising

Gives rise to the basic arising,

How, according[]{#calibre_link-1524} to you, does this,

Not arisen from the basic arising, give rise to that?

But Nāgārjuna makes the obvious move in reply: Does the basic arising
arise from a more basic arising, or is it somehow unarisen
[]{#calibre_link-323}(eternal or inexplicable)? If the former, then we
seem to have an infinite regress; if the latter, a petitio principii.
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1525}gārjuna makes some of the numerous difficulties
that afflict this view explicit in the next two verses:

6\. If, as you say, that which is arisen from basic arising

Gives rise to the basis,

How does that nonarisen basis

Give rise to it?

The account is either circular or regressive. If the basic arising is
held to arise in dependence on other dependently
originated[]{#calibre_link-1526} phenomena, and dependent arising is
explained as dependent upon the basic arising, then the basis is posited
as dependent upon that which it explains, and we have a vicious circle.
If on the other hand the phenomena on which the basis depends are other
than those it explains, and the phenomena themselves depend upon yet
another basis, we have a vicious regress.

In the next verse, Nā[]{#calibre_link-1527}gārjuna points out the
question-begging alternative reading of the enterprise. He notes that
one may explain that dependent arising arises through basic arising
without circles or regresses, but only by positing the basis as itself
nonarisen. This, of course, flies in the face of the demand that
motivates positing it in the first place---namely, the demand that
every[]{#calibre_link-1528} phenomenon, including dependent arising, be
explained by some ontologically more fundamental phenomenon:

7\. If this nonarisen

Could give rise to that,

Then, as you wish,

It will give rise to that which is arising.

The opponent now suggests another reply. Using the analogy of a lamp
that illuminates both itself and others, he argues that arising can give
rise to itself and to others. This[]{#calibre_link-1529} would, from the
standpoint of the reificationist, have the happy consequence that while
other phenomena would be dependent on dependent arising, dependent
arising would be independent and nonempty:

[]{#calibre_link-391}8. Just as a butterlamp

Illuminates itself as well as others,

So arising gives rise to itself

And to other arisen things.

Nāgārjuna now[]{#calibre_link-1530} launches a lengthy critique of the
example, arguing that the relation between the butterlamp and what it
illuminates is not one that supports a notion of an inherently existent
basis on which things that are not inherently existent can depend:

9\. In the butterlamp and its place,

There is no darkness.

What then does the butterlamp illuminate?

For illumination is the clearing of darkness.

[]{#calibre_link-1531}Here Nāgārjuna is emphasizing a disanalogy between
the relation between the butterlamp and what it illuminates, and the
putative relation between dependent arising and what it depends upon.
The opponent who wields the example does so in order to demonstrate a
difference in status between dependent arising and the dependently
arisen. Dependent[]{#calibre_link-1532} arising is meant not to be
dependently arisen, despite the fact that all dependently arisen
phenomena are. So the appropriate analogy in the case of the lamp would
map this difference in status between being dependently arisen and being
independent onto the difference between being illuminated and not being
illuminated. The problem, though, is that in the example there is
nothing that is not[]{#calibre_link-1533} illuminated: Everything in the
neighborhood of the lamp is illuminated just as is the lamp.

It was standard philosophical fare in the Buddhist tradition within
which Nāgārjuna was working to see darkness as a positive phenomenon. So
to the extent that one adopted a reified ontology, darkness would be
reified as easily as light. The attack[]{#calibre_link-1534} on the
butterlamp analogy can thus effectively exploit the difficulties
Nāgārjuna has already developed for theories that require inherently
existent things to be related to one another. But it is important to see
that even if one is not disposed to reify darkness, and regards it as
the mere absence of light, to the extent that one
reifies[]{#calibre_link-1535} light, Nāgārjuna can argue that one will
be compelled to reify []{#calibre_link-1536}darkness as well. For if
light exists inherently, then wherever light is not present it is
essentially not present. And the essential nonpresence of light is
essential darkness.

10\. If the arising butterlamp

Does not reach darkness,

How could that arising butterlamp

Have[]{#calibre_link-1537} cleared the darkness?

Moreover, argues Nāgārjuna, the example itself does not bear close
scrutiny as a case of an entity with some inherent power giving rise to
a set of effects that depend upon it. For the task of the butterlamp is
the clearing of darkness---or the production of illumination. Now the
production of light and the clearing[]{#calibre_link-1538} of darkness
are, Nāgārjuna claims, equivalent. So, if the butterlamp illuminates
objects by its light reaching them, it should clear darkness by means of
its light reaching darkness. But that would be for light and darkness to
be present in the same place, which is contradictory.

11\. If the illumination of darkness occurs

Without the[]{#calibre_link-1539} butterlamp reaching darkness,

All of the darkness in the world

Should be illuminated.

If it is not necessary, on the other hand, for the light of the
butterlamp to reach darkness in order to dispel it, since there is a lot
of darkness in the world not reached by any single butterlamp, that
butterlamp should be capable of dispelling all of that darkness.

12\. If, when it is illuminated,

The[]{#calibre_link-1540} butterlamp illuminates itself and others,

Darkness should, without a doubt,

Conceal itself and others.

Finally, Nāgārjuna argues, if we are seriously to maintain that the
butterlamp illuminates itself and others through a luminous essence,
then since the essence of darkness is to conceal things, and things with
such essences affect[]{#calibre_link-1541} themselves and others, we
should expect darkness to be self-concealing. But then we would not see
darkness.

[]{#calibre_link-494}The point of all of this is not that we can't see
lamps when they are lit or that we can when they aren't. Rather it is
that the mechanism by which we see what we see when a lamp is lit is the
same whether we are seeing the lamp or other things. To put it in
contemporary terms, photons[]{#calibre_link-1542} reach our eyes from
the lamp or from its flame in the same way they do from the other
physical objects in the neighborhood. And just as the visibility of the
things in the neighborhood is dependent on a host of conditions, so is
the visibility of the lamp. So we do not have even an analogy to a case
where the status of dependent arising would be distinct from that of the
dependently arisen.

[]{#calibre_link-1543}13. How could this arising, being nonarisen,

Give rise to itself?

And if it is arisen from another,

Having arisen, what is the need for another arising?

Here Nāgārjuna is bringing us back to the original argument and
reminding us of the reificationist's uncomfortable choice between a
vicious regress and a begged question. If every[]{#calibre_link-1544}
arisen thing depends on an ontologically prior arising, we have an
infinite regress. For each arising will require such a foundation. But
if we cut off the regress by presupposing at some level a nonarisen
dependent arising, we have to ask why *that* level is exempt from the
need for explanation. Nāgārjuna now announces the conclusion
he[]{#calibre_link-1545} will defend in the next section of the chapter:

14\. The arisen, the non-arisen and that which is arising

Do not arise in any way at all.

Thus they should be understood

Just like the gone, the not-gone, and the going.

Recall the analysis of motion: Nāgārjuna argued that no entity answering
to "motion" could be found in an entity that[]{#calibre_link-1546} was
in motion in the past, nor in an entity yet to move, nor in a currently
moving entity. Motion had to be understood relationally and not as an
entity. Using similar reasoning, Nāgārjuna will now argue that arising
cannot be found as an entity in something not yet arisen,
[]{#calibre_link-435}nor in something that has already arisen, nor in
something yet[]{#calibre_link-1547} to arise. Arising will also fail to
be an entity and will have to be understood relationally. This will
provide the key both to the refutation of the position that underlies
both extreme positions---that for arising to exist, it must exist
inherently---and to the construction of a coherent positive account of
dependent arising. The next three verses begin a sketch of dependent
arising as empty, connecting[]{#calibre_link-1548} this fact with the
emptiness of dependently arisen phenomena:

15\. When there is arising but not yet

That which is arising,

How can we say that that which is arising

Depends on this arising?

Nāgārjuna here suggests that the way the reificationist has gone about
posing the philosophical problem about the status of dependent
arising[]{#calibre_link-1549} itself is all wrong. The initial
presumption at the basis of this debate is that arisen entities arise
from an independently existing process of dependent arising. But this is
wrongheaded in at least two ways: First, phenomena arise from other
phenomena, not from arising. So, for instance, if I strike a match, the
fire emerges from the friction, the sulphur, the oxygen, my desire for
light, and so[]{#calibre_link-1550} forth, but *not* from dependent
arising itself. That is a fact at a different level of analysis, which
itself comprises the network of relationships just indicated. Second, if
the existence of the process of arising antedates the existence of the
arisen, it cannot be a sufficient condition or a complete explanation of
the arisen. For if it were, the arisen would then exist. That being so,
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1551}gārjuna asks, "Why posit dependent arising
itself as a phenomenon within the framework of dependent arising?"

16\. Whatever is dependently arisen,

Such a thing is essentially peaceful.

Therefore that which is arising and arising itself

Are themselves peaceful.

The sense of "peaceful" *(zhi-ba)* here is important.
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1552}rjuna is asserting that things are not, from
the ultimate point of view, in the constant flux of arising, remaining,
and decaying that characterizes []{#calibre_link-510}them from the
conventional point of view. This will be the conclusion of the extended
argument that follows and is here merely announced in advance. But it is
important at this stage to be clear about just what
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1553}rjuna is asserting for it is indeed a delicate
point: It is true that ordinarily and prereflectively, and sometimes as
the result of bad philosophy, we tend to think of things as permanent
and as having fixed essential natures. But a careful reflection on the
nature of conventional phenomena shows them on analysis to be
impermanent and, hence, to be characterized by the three properties of
arising,[]{#calibre_link-1554} stasis, and
cessation.[]{#calibre_link-649}[^54^](#calibre_link-161){.nounder}

But while this takes us to a deeper understanding of the nature of
phenomena, it does not take us all the way. For phenomena, having no
essence, cannot have even these properties essentially. One way of
seeing that is this: If we take the import of the threefold nature of
phenomena seriously, we see that the phenomena are themselves literally
momentary. And if they are[]{#calibre_link-1555} momentary, then there
is literally no time for them to arise, to endure, or to decay. So from
an ultimate point of view, the point of view from which they have no
existence as extended phenomena at all, they do not possess these three
properties. Hence no single real entity is in flux. In this sense they
are peaceful. Nāgārjuna points[]{#calibre_link-1556} out the other way
of seeing phenomena in the next verse: It does not follow from the fact
that there are no inherently existent arisen entities that there are
non-arisen ones. All phenomena are arisen, but they arise as empty, and
as dependent. Coming to be just is arising, and all arising is dependent
arising.

Nāgārjuna now turns his[]{#calibre_link-1557} attention to an analysis
of the three characteristics of arising, stasis, and cessation, showing
of each in turn that it cannot be understood as ontologically
independent. He begins with arising:

17\. If a nonarisen entity

Anywhere exists,

That entity would have to arise.

But if it were nonexistent, what could arise?

[]{#calibre_link-1558}We can exclude nonarisen entities from the
analysis since the only sense[]{#calibre_link-1559} that we can make of
the existence of any phenomenon is in terms of its having arisen.
Arising is hence a ubiquitous characteristic of phenomena. This, of
course, is part of what motivates treating it, as well as stasis and
cessation, as inherently existent.

18\. If this arising

Gave rise to that which is arising,

By means of what arising

Does that arising arise?

If we take arisen things to[]{#calibre_link-1560} require ontological
grounds, then ground them not in other arisen things (since that would
generate an obvious regress within the phenomenal world), but in
dependent arising itself, there remains the infinite regress to which
Nāgārjuna alluded earlier. Assuming dependent arising is to be the
ground, then if grounds are needed, it too[]{#calibre_link-1561} needs a
ground. Nāgārjuna makes this explicit in the following verse:

19\. If another arising gives rise to this one,

There would be an infinite regress.

If something nonarisen is arisen,

Then all things could arise in this way.

The last two lines of this verse emphasize that the regress cannot ever
be cut off by positing some nonarisen[]{#calibre_link-1562} arising.
That would, as Nāgārjuna argued above, patently beg the question.

20\. Neither an existent nor a nonexistent

Can be properly said to arise.

As it is taught before with

"For neither an existent nor a nonexistent."

The reference of the last line is to I: 6:

For neither an existent nor a nonexistent thing

Is a condition appropriate.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1563}
:::

If a thing is nonexistent, how could it have a condition?

If a thing is already existent, what would a condition do?

[]{#calibre_link-348}The implicit argument is, then, that inherently
existent phenomena cannot be said to arise since they would exist
eternally and independently; nonexistent phenomena cannot be said to
arise since if they did, they would exist. Arising can hence only be a
property of noninherently,[]{#calibre_link-1564} but conventionally,
existent phenomena. But it then follows that arising as a property can
only be a noninherently existent, conventional property.

Nāgārjuna now turns his attention to the properties of cessation and
endurance. He begins, though, with a final remark on arising as a
transition, concerning the relation between
arising[]{#calibre_link-1565} and cessation. This next verse must be
read along with VII: 23 and 26. Together they constitute an exhaustive
discussion of the possible inherence of the three properties under
discussion in ceasing entities:

21\. The arising of a ceasing thing

Is not tenable.

But to say that it is not ceasing

Is not tenable for anything.

The first alternative Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1566}rjuna considers is that
a ceasing thing is arising. But if a thing is already ceasing, it is
therefore no longer arising. And since all phenomena are, when their
impermanence is taken into consideration, ceasing, it would follow that
nothing can be said to be arising.

22\. A static existent does not
endure.[]{#calibre_link-651}[^55^](#calibre_link-162){.nounder}

A nonstatic existent does not endure.

Stasis does not endure.

What nonarisen can endure?

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1567}
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1568}Nāgārjuna now turns to stasis---the moment between
arising and ceasing. This verse must be read along with VII: 23, 25, and
27, which together provide a complete examination of the status of
stasis. Here he emphasizes that the moment between the arising and
ceasing of a momentary phenomenon---an event---has no temporal extent.
So a thing that[]{#calibre_link-1569} we might conventionally refer to
as static literally does not endure with identity through time. But of
course neither does something that is not even conventionally static.
And finally, since as a consequence of these two premises stasis is not
instantiated in any phenomenon, it itself does not endure. So, Nāgārjuna
concludes, stasis[]{#calibre_link-1570} fails to exist over time in any
sense and so is no candidate for an inherently existent phenomenon.

23\. The endurance of a ceasing entity

Is not tenable.

But to say that it is not ceasing

Is not tenable for anything.

This verse plays a central role in each of two interwoven arguments. In
the context of VII: 21 and 26, it provides part of the exhaustive
analysis of the impossibility of arising,[]{#calibre_link-1571} abiding
and ceasing as instantiated in ceasing (hence in impermanent) phenomena.
In the context of VII: 22, 25, and 27, it provides part of the analysis
of the impossibility of locating endurance in any phenomenon, hence
emphasizing the impermanence of all phenomena. Since to exist is to
exist in time and things that are ceasing are by definition not in a
state of continued existence, ceasing[]{#calibre_link-1572} phenomena do
not provide the kind of continuity with numerical identity that
endurance demands. And all phenomena are, upon analysis, seen to be
constantly ceasing. So endurance has no possibility of instantiation,
and ceasing phenomena cannot have this property as an essential
attribute.

24\. Inasmuch as the nature of all things

Is aging and death,

Without aging and death,

What existents can[]{#calibre_link-1573} endure?

[]{#calibre_link-349}Moreover, since all things decay, this analysis is
perfectly general. Nothing exists in the way that it would have to in
order to have endurance as part of its essence.

25\. Stasis cannot endure through itself

Or through another stasis.

Just as arising cannot arise from itself

Or from another arising.

This verse recalls the discussion of VII: 13--19 and has an important
echo in VII:[]{#calibre_link-1574} 32. Nāgārjuna argued earlier that we
cannot analyze arising either as sui generis or as dependent upon some
other arising. In the first case, we beg the question; in the second we
invite an infinite regress. He now points out that the same is true of
stasis. We can't, in order to demonstrate the inherent existence of
stasis, argue that[]{#calibre_link-1575} it endures because of itself.
If this kind of reflexive explanation were possible, we would not need
to posit stasis in the first place as an explanation of the continued
existence of empirical phenomena. Each could count as self-explanatory.
But if we say that stasis, like other static things, is static because
of its possessing a distinct stasis, we are off on a vicious regress.

26\. The ceasing[]{#calibre_link-1576} of what has ceased does not
happen.

What has not yet ceased does not cease.

Nor does that which is ceasing.

What nonarisen can cease?

Nāgārjuna thus completes the tripartite argument for the impossibility
of the instantiation of arising, abiding, and ceasing begun in VII: 21
and 23. Cessation, conceived of as an inherently
existent,[]{#calibre_link-1577} independent property, needs a
substratum. We have seen in the previous two verses in this argument
that neither arising nor static things can provide this substratum. The
only alternative remaining is the ceasing. But these phenomena, passing
out of existence, are by definition not inherently existent and so fail
as candidates. And again, since all phenomena are ceasing, this means
that ceasing[]{#calibre_link-1578} as an independent property has no
basis. The argument here is an []{#calibre_link-1579}obvious echo of the
argument against the inherent existence of motion. So the conclusion to
draw is not that there is no cessation or that there are no ceasing
phenomena. That would be crazy. Rather, neither cessation nor any
impermanent phenomenon can be identified independently as an entity
itself. Their existence is purely relational.[]{#calibre_link-1580}
Nāgārjuna now turns to the cessation of the static:

27\. The cessation of what is static

Is not tenable.

Nor is the cessation of

Something not static tenable.

Two points are being made here: First, if there were intrinsically real
entities that could serve as ontological bases for cessation, they would
have to have either remained[]{#calibre_link-1581} stable or not. If the
former, then in virtue of having the nature of stasis, they would be
incapable of cessation. If the latter, since they never really existed,
there is nothing to cease. But there is also a second point being made
that depends upon the conventional reality of cessation. Since cessation
is conventionally real and is incompatible both with inherently existent
stasis and with there[]{#calibre_link-1582} being no stasis at all, both
of these alternatives with respect to stasis are eliminated. Cessation
and stasis must be understood relatively and not absolutely. This point
is reiterated in the following verse:

28\. Being static does not cease

Through being static itself.

Nor does being static cease

Through another instance of being static.

This verse also echoes VII: 25 and that discussion[]{#calibre_link-1583}
of the impossibility of arising being either self-explanatory or always
explained by reference to yet another arising. All things, having
remained momentarily in existence, change constantly. This, however,
cannot be explained by reference to the nature of stasis, either
reflexively or regressively.

[]{#calibre_link-1584}29. When the arising of any entity

Is not tenable.

Then the cessation of any entity

Is not[]{#calibre_link-1585} tenable.

Since nothing arises inherently, nothing ceases inherently. Since upon
careful examination nothing withstands analysis as an inherently
existing phenomenon, nothing remains independent of conventional
designation to be characterized as arising or ceasing. This is how it
goes from the ultimate standpoint. From that standpoint---though
achieved by noting the universality of arising and
cessation[]{#calibre_link-1586} of conventional phenomena---since there
are no phenomena, there is no arising and cessation. But by
contraposition we get the corelativity and mutual entailment of arising
and ceasing at the conventional level.

30\. For an existent thing

Cessation is not tenable.

A single thing being an entity and

A nonentity is not tenable.

This verse and the next reinforce the point about the ultimate
nonexistence[]{#calibre_link-1587} of cessation and, by implication, of
arising and stasis. In the preceding, Nāgārjuna emphasizes that for an
inherently existent entity to cease to exist would be for it to
inherently exist and not exist. In the subsequent verse, he points out
that it makes no sense for a nonexistent thing to cease to be, just as
it makes no sense to behead[]{#calibre_link-1588} someone a second time:

31\. Moreover, for a nonentity,

Cessation would be untenable.

Just as a second beheading

Cannot be performed.

32\. Cessation does not cease by means of itself.

Nor does it cease by means of another.

Just as arising cannot arise from itself

Or from another arising.

[]{#calibre_link-286}This verse has an exact parallel in VII: 25. Again,
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1589}rjuna recalls the uncomfortable choice between
a trivially begged question and a vicious regress presented originally
in the context of the discussion of arising and recalled in the
discussion of stasis. The argument applies, mutatis mutandis, to
cessation. The conclusion of this trio of arguments is that we cannot
conceive of any of the three characteristics of dependent arising as
self-grounded.[]{#calibre_link-1590} All must be understood dependently
and hence as empty.

33\. Since arising, ceasing, and abiding

Are not established, there are no compounded things.

If all compounded things are unestablished,

How could the uncompounded be established?

That is, arising, abiding, and ceasing are not entities at all---they
are mere relations. Since these fundamental attributes of dependently
arisen phenomena are[]{#calibre_link-1591} empty of inherent existence,
what could have inherent existence?

34\. Like a dream, like an illusion,

Like a city of Gandharvas,

So have arising, abiding,

And ceasing been explained.

This chapter thus brings the first principal section of
*Mūlamadhyamakakārik*ā to a close, drawing together the threads spun
in[]{#calibre_link-1592} the earlier chapters to produce a thorough
demonstration of the emptiness of the conventional phenomenal world.
Having demonstrated the emptiness of conditions and their relations to
their effects, change and impermanence, the elements, the
aggregates,[]{#calibre_link-653}[^56^](#calibre_link-163){.nounder} and
characteristics and their bases---in short, of all the fundamental
Buddhist categories of analysis and
explanation---Nā[]{#calibre_link-1593}gārjuna has now considered the
totality they determine---dependent arising itself and the entire
dependently arisen phenomenal world---[]{#calibre_link-419}arguing that
dependent arising and what is dependently arisen are themselves empty of
inherent existence.

This is a deep result. It again presages the doctrine of the emptiness
of emptiness that is made explicit in [Chapter
XXIV](#calibre_link-63){.nounder}, and it[]{#calibre_link-1594} develops
further the theme explored in [Chapter I](#calibre_link-40){.nounder},
namely, that when from the Mādhyamika perspective one asserts that a
thing is empty or that it is dependently arisen, one is not contrasting
their status with the status of some other things that are inherently
existent. Nor is one asserting that they are *merely* dependent on some
more fundamental independent thing.[]{#calibre_link-1595} Nor is one
asserting that instead of having an independent essence things have as
their essence dependence or emptiness, either or both of which exist in
some other way. Rather, as far as one analyzes, one finds only
dependence, relativity, and emptiness, and their dependence, relativity,
and emptiness.

But this is not to say either that emptiness, dependent arising or
conventional phenomena[]{#calibre_link-1596} are nonexistent---that they
are hallucinations. Indeed it is to say the opposite. For the upshot of
this critical analysis is that existence itself must be reconceived.
What is said to be "like a dream, like an illusion" is their existence
in the mode in which they are ordinarily perceived/conceived---as
inherently existent. Inherent existence simply is an incoherent
notion.[]{#calibre_link-655}[^57^](#calibre_link-164){.nounder} The only
sense that[]{#calibre_link-1597} "existence" can be given is a
conventional, relative sense. And in demonstrating that phenomena have
exactly that kind of existence and that dependent arising has exactly
that kind of existence, we recover the existence of phenomenal reality
in the context of emptiness. In the next major section, comprising
Chapters VIII through XIII, Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1598}rjuna addresses
the emptiness of the subject of experience.

## **[]{#calibre_link-271 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-47 .calibre4}Chapter VIII  Examination of the Agent and Action** {#chapter-viii-examination-of-the-agent-and-action-1 .h1}

The discussion of external phenomena comprised by the first seven
chapters of the text leads naturally to a discussion of the subject side
of experience, a discussion that occupies the next six chapters. For it
might be granted that the phenomenal external world is empty, but argued
that it depends for its nominal existence on an inherently
existing[]{#calibre_link-1601} subject. This idealist tactic, familiar
in the West through Berkeley and Hume (and criticized by Kant in the
refutation of idealism), was adopted by some (the Cittamātra school) in
the history of Buddhist philosophy. We can well imagine an opponent at
this stage in the dialectic conceding to Nāgārjuna
that[]{#calibre_link-1602} external phenomena lack inherent existence
and that the dependent arising that characterizes them lacks inherent
existence, but that their very emptiness entails their nominal character
and, hence, some subject capable of engaging in nominal imputation. So
the subject as agent must exist.

1\. This existent agent

Does not perform an existent action.

Nor does some nonexistent agent

Perform some[]{#calibre_link-1603} nonexistent action.

[]{#calibre_link-277}Nāgārjuna here announces that, with respect to
agency and action as well, he will steer a middle course between
inherent existence and complete nonexistence. Neither action nor agent
will come out to be an inherently existing entity. Nor will either end
up being completely nonexistent.

2\. An existent entity has no[]{#calibre_link-1604} activity.

There would also be action without an agent.

An existent entity has no activity.

There would also be agent without action.

If the agent were inherently existent, then it would be unchanging.
Activity is always a kind of change. So if there were action in the
context of an inherently existing agent, the action would be agentless,
which would be absurd. Moreover, the agent would
be[]{#calibre_link-1605} inactive, which would also be absurd. This, of
course, is just one more case of Nāgārjuna demonstrating the incoherence
of a position that tries both to posit inherently existent, independent
entities and then to get them to interact.

3\. If a nonexistent agent

Were to perform a nonexistent action,

Then the action would be without a[]{#calibre_link-1606} cause

And the agent would be without a cause.

However, if agent and action are totally nonexistent, there will be no
cause for the action and no justification for calling the agent an
agent.

4\. Without a cause, the effect and

Its cause will not occur.

Without this, activity and

Agent and action are not possible.

Agent, the agent's activity, and the action all depend upon conditions.
They[]{#calibre_link-1607} are all, therefore, dependently arisen and
empty. If, as the opponent would have it, these are inherently existent,
there would be no action. But if we think of them as dependent, we can
make perfectly good sense of agent, activity and action in
interrelation.

[]{#calibre_link-283}5. If activity, etc., are not possible,

Entities and nonentities are not possible.

If there are neither entities nor nonentities,

[]{#calibre_link-1608}Effects cannot arise from them.

If there were no action, then since entities arise from the action of
previous events, there would be no entities and no effects. In short,
without making sense of the possibility of actions and agency as empty,
we can't account for the existence of any phenomena.

6\. If there are no effects, liberation and

Paths to higher realms will not exist.

So all of activity

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1609}
:::

Would be without purpose.

And all of this has a moral and a soteriological dimension as well. For
if there are no acts and no effects, then the practice of morality and
of the Buddhist path will make no sense. There would be no point to life
if human action is impossible. And again, its impossibility follows
straightforwardly from the reification of either agent or action. It is
ironic that it[]{#calibre_link-1610} is the urge to guarantee more
reality and significance for ourselves than emptiness appears to allow
that leads to a view of life as perfectly impossible and pointless. That
is, though we are led to ascribe inherent, independent existence to
ourselves and to the world of phenomena we cherish---in part, in order
to assign them the greatest possible importance---this very importance
would be completely[]{#calibre_link-1611} undermined by such inherent
existence and independence. For in that case, all activity and all
consequences of activity would be impossible. The resultant life would
be static, detached, and utterly meaningless. Only in the context of
emptiness---what might appear to be the greatest threat to
meaningfulness---can a meaningful life be understood.

7\. An existent and nonexistent agent

Does not perform[]{#calibre_link-1612} an existent and nonexistent
action.

Existence and nonexistence cannot pertain to the same thing.

For how could they exist together?

[]{#calibre_link-1613}There is no way to escape from this dilemma by
trying to have it both ways: The agent cannot be existent as an actor,
but nonexistent as one who undergoes the action. Nor can the action be
existent as an entity, but nonexistent as dependent upon the agent.

8.[]{#calibre_link-1614} An actual agent

Does not perform a nonactual action.

Nor by a nonactual one is an actual one performed.

From this, all of those errors would follow.

Nor is it coherent to suppose that the agent is existent, but the action
nonexistent. For then there would be no reason to call the agent an
agent. An agent, after all, is someone who performs an action. The next
two verses put this point and[]{#calibre_link-1615} those made in the
opening verses together:

9\. An existent agent

Does not perform an action that

Is unreal or both real and unreal

As we have already agreed.

10\. A nonexistent agent

Does not perform an action that

Is unreal or both real and unreal

As we have already agreed.

11\. An existent and nonexistent agent

does not perform an action that

Is unreal or both real and unreal

As we[]{#calibre_link-1616} have agreed.

Nāgārjuna now moves to assert his positive position on this matter:
Agent and action are interdependent. Neither is logically or
ontologically prior to or independent of the other. What it is to be an
agent is to be performing an action. What it is to be an action is to be
the action of an agent:

12\. Action depends upon[]{#calibre_link-1617} the agent.

The agent itself depends on action.

One cannot see any way

To establish them differently.

[]{#calibre_link-289}13. From this elimination of agent and action,

One should elucidate appropriation in the same way.

Through action and agent

All remaining things should be understood.

By "appropriation," Nāgārjuna indicates any cognitive act
by[]{#calibre_link-1618} means of which one takes an attribute or entity
as one's own, or as part of one's self. That includes the grasping of
the aggregates as the self or of one's mental states as part of one's
identity or of one's possessions as central to one's being.
Appropriation in this broad sense is, hence, a central object of concern
for Buddhist philosophy and psychology, and the relation between the
appropriator[]{#calibre_link-1619} and the act of appropriation is an
important object of analysis. For in many ways the self that is
constructed through appropriation presents itself as the subject of
appropriation. But it is merely constructed, and its substantial reality
is illusory. Then what indeed does the appropriation? And where there is
no appropriator, how does appropriation occur?
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1620}rjuna here suggests that this account of the
relation between agent and action provides a model for understanding
that relation. That is, this analysis provides a perfect paradigm for
understanding the nature of subjectivity. In all cases of the relation
between an agent of any kind and an act of any kind, the identity of the
two will be seen to be mutually dependent, and each will come out
as[]{#calibre_link-1621} conventionally real, though not as inherently
existent. We will see this paradigm articulated over the next five
chapters as Nāgārjuna argues that we cannot make any sense of the self
as an entity independent of its actions, perceptions, and interactions.
Nor can we make any sense of the ontology of these phenomena as
independent of the[]{#calibre_link-1622} subject. This is a natural
extension of the analysis of emptiness of the external world and
demonstrates Nāgārjuna's determination to treat all phenomena on the
same basis.

## **[]{#calibre_link-398 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-48 .calibre4}Chapter IX  Examination of the Prior Entity** {#chapter-ix-examination-of-the-prior-entity-1 .h1}

Now one can surely imagine an opponent responding to the argument of the
previous chapter by granting that agency and its corelative phenomena
might be empty, yet still denying that awareness itself---the
subjectivity that grounds perception---could be empty. For, one might
argue, the emptiness of all phenomena still requires that there be a
subject for[]{#calibre_link-1625} whom they *are* phenomena. Nāgārjuna
articulates this response in the opening verses of this chapter:

1\. Since sight and hearing, etc., and

Feeling, etc., exist,

He who has and uses them

Must exist prior to those, some say.

2\. If there were no existent thing,

How could seeing, etc., arise?

It follows from this that prior to this,

[]{#calibre_link-1626}there is an existent thing.

That is, without a subject of experience, there can be no experience and
no experienced objects. This argument has familiar instances in
Descartes and Kant. But Nāgārjuna, siding with Hume on this issue,
begins by asking how this entity could be an object of knowledge:

[]{#calibre_link-290}3. How is an entity existing prior to

[]{#calibre_link-1627}Seeing, hearing, etc., and

The felt, etc.,

Itself known?

So first, Nāgārjuna points out, we have no direct evidence for the
existence of such an entity because evidence of it would require that it
could be an object, but is supposed by its proponent to be purely
subjective. Moreover, Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1628}rjuna points out, it is
supposed to be independent of and ontologically prior to perception and
the perceived. So:

4\. If it can abide

Without the seen, etc.,

Then, without a doubt,

They can abide without it.

That is, independence is a two-way street. If the self is independent of
its perceiving and perception, then its perceiving and perception are
independent of it. Now there is one reading[]{#calibre_link-1629} of
this claim on which it is straightforwardly and foolishly fallacious.
Nāgārjuna is *not* arguing that all relations are symmetric. It does not
follow from the fact that this book is on your table that your table is
on the book, and Nāgārjuna is not foolish enough to think
that[]{#calibre_link-1630} it does. The point is, rather, once again the
Humean one that whatever is indeed logically independent is separable.
The opponent wants to argue that the self is logically independent of
its perceptions and their contents. But if so, then they are separable,
and we can imagine not only a nonperceiving subject, but also
unperceived perceptions. Just as we can imagine a clear table and a book
not[]{#calibre_link-1631} on a table. But, Nāgārjuna suggests, the idea
of unperceived perceptions is both absurd on its face and contradictory
to the opponent's theoretical framework.

5\. Someone is disclosed by something.

Something is disclosed by
someone.[]{#calibre_link-657}[^58^](#calibre_link-167){.nounder}

[]{#calibre_link-485}Without something how can someone exist?

Without someone how can something exist?

Nā[]{#calibre_link-1632}gārjuna here emphasizes the corelativity and
interdependence of subject and
object.[]{#calibre_link-659}[^59^](#calibre_link-168){.nounder}
Subjectivity only emerges when there is an object of awareness. Pure
subjectivity is a contradiction in adjecto. Moreover, the idea of an
object with no subject is contradictory. The very concept of being an
object is that of being the object of a subject. The affinities to Kant
and[]{#calibre_link-1633} Schopenhauer here are quite strong, but should
not be pushed too far. Nāgārjuna would clearly have no truck with the
substantialist flavor of their analysis of the subject and object.

6\. While prior to all of seeing, etc.,

That prior entity doesn't exist,

Through seeing, etc., by another one,

That other one becomes disclosed.

An[]{#calibre_link-1634} opponent might at this point argue that
although there is no continuous prior entity that endures through time
and stands behind all perception, we must posit an entity as the basis
of each individual perceptual episode. The self on this model would be a
succession of momentary but inherently existent subjects of moments of
experience. But, Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1635}rjuna argues in the next
verse, the same argument against positing a single prior entity can be
mobilized against each punctal prior entity:

7\. If prior to all of seeing, etc.,

No prior entity exists,

[]{#calibre_link-1636}How could an entity prior

To each seeing exist?

That is, given that there is no need to identify an independent self as
the basis of all seeing, there is no need to establish one as a basis
for[]{#calibre_link-1637} each one independently. The same arguments for
the relativity and relational character of perception apply, mutatis
mutandis, for each perceptual episode. Moreover, even if we did posit
such entities, they would get us nowhere toward positing the self that
the reifier of self really cares about---a continuous self with which we
can really identity and whose fate we can care about.

8\. If the seer[]{#calibre_link-1638} itself is the hearer itself,

And the feeler itself, at different times,

Prior to each of these he would have to arise.

But this makes no sense.

Moreover, since this proposal is for a distinct prior entity for each
perceptual episode, we would need distinct subjects for, for example,
hearing and seeing. But as we can do these things at the same time, it
would follow that there are multiple[]{#calibre_link-1639} simultaneous
selves. The unity of experience that is the putative explanandum and
motivation for positing this entity in the first place (emphasized in
the first two lines) would dissolve. Nāgārjuna emphasizes this
conclusion at IX: 9:

9\. If the seer itself is distinct,

The hearer is distinct and the feeler is distinct,

Then when there[]{#calibre_link-1640} is a seer there would also be a
hearer,

And there would have to be many selves.

10\. Seeing and hearing, etc.,

And feeling, etc.,

And that from which these are arisen:

There is no existent there.

However, one should not be tempted to try to ground perception, the
perceived object, and the perceiver in some more fundamental
[]{#calibre_link-443}ontological ground---some intrinsically identical
basis for their existence.[]{#calibre_link-1641} For the need to develop
a substantial foundation for these phenomena should vanish once one sees
that not only do they have no ultimate ontic status, but that they need
none. They, like all phenomena, emerge relationally and dependently.

11\. Seeing and hearing, etc.,

And feeling, etc.,

If that to which they belong does not exist,

They themselves do not exist.

Not only has this analysis refuted[]{#calibre_link-1642} the inherent
existence of the self as a basis for experience, but in virtue of so
doing, it has refuted the inherent existence of perception and the
perceptual faculties.

12\. For whomever prior to,

Simultaneous with, or after seeing, etc., there is nothing,

For such a one, assertions like "it exists" or "it does not exist"---

Such conceptions will cease.

Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1643}rjuna here generalizes the point and offers a
diagnosis of the confusion he has worked to resolve: Just as we want to
say that the self as pure subject does not exist---nor do perception or
perceptual objects exist as entities---yet want to affirm the
conventional reality of perception, perceivers, and perceiveds, in
general, we want to deny the inherent existence of phenomena and affirm
their conventional[]{#calibre_link-1644} reality. Just as we want to say
that the self neither exists inherently nor that it is nonexistent
inherently, we want to refrain from attributing inherent existence or
inherent nonexistence to all entities. The apparent paradox involved in
saying that things both exist and do not exist in one breath and saying
that they neither exist nor do not exist in another---indeed of refusing
in another[]{#calibre_link-1645} sense to permit even these predications
in another mood---arises, Nāgārjuna points out, from the conceptual
imputation of inherently existent bases for these predications, which
then have to be thought of as having contradictory properties.
[]{#calibre_link-399}Absent the bases, we can see these assertions
merely as useful analytical tools in various
dialectical[]{#calibre_link-1646} contexts to help us to see the
ultimately empty and conventionally real nature of phenomena. And
Nāgārjuna concludes this chapter by asserting that once one ceases
hypostasizing the subjective self---that entity that might seem to be,
as Descartes notes, the most obviously existent and most easily known
entity of all---the temptation to hypostasize[]{#calibre_link-1647}
other entities dissolves.

## **[]{#calibre_link-432 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-49 .calibre4}Chapter X  Examination of Fire and Fuel** {#chapter-x-examination-of-fire-and-fuel-1 .h1}

This chapter, the only one in this set of chapters ostensibly addressing
an external phenomenon, is in fact concerned entirely with a standard
counterexample to the kind of arguments Nāgārjuna offered in the two
previous chapters on subjectivity in action and in perception. Recall
that in those[]{#calibre_link-1650} discussions Nāgārjuna argues that
subject and object cannot be intrinsically and distinctly identified as
entities because of their mutual dependence. Buddhist schools asserting
substantial identity in the context of dependent coorigination, such as
Vaibhāśika and Sautrāntika[]{#calibre_link-1651} schools, used the
example of fire and fuel to demonstrate the compossibility of
substantial independent identity and dependent origination, as well as
the possibility of the one-way dependence relation that these schools
assert that actions and perception bear to the self. Just as fire
depends on fuel but not vice versa, they would argue, and just as fire
and fuel have distinct identities despite[]{#calibre_link-1652} the fact
that the former depends for its existence on the latter, action and
perception can depend on the subject but not vice versa. Despite this
dependence, proponents of this view would argue each relatum can be
individually established as an
entity.[]{#calibre_link-661}[^60^](#calibre_link-170){.nounder} In this
chapter, Nāgārjuna undertakes the task of demonstrating that the
example[]{#calibre_link-1653} does not demonstrate these possibilities.

[]{#calibre_link-1654}1. If fuel were fire

Then agent and action would be one.

If fire were different from fuel,

Then it could arise without
fuel.[]{#calibre_link-663}[^61^](#calibre_link-171){.nounder}

The opponent does not want to assert the identity of fire and fuel,
first, since it would contradict common sense, but second, since that,
by the intended analogy, would identify agent and action, self and
perception. On the[]{#calibre_link-1655} other hand, if they are
identified as intrinsically different---as having distinct and
independent essential identities---they should be able to arise
independently. Fuel should count as fuel even if there were no fire;
fire should be possible without fuel. This follows from drawing the
distinction at the level of intrinsic identity. Of course,
distinguishing them conventionally permits their
mutual[]{#calibre_link-1656} dependence, but fails to establish the
intrinsic identity intended by the reificationist.

2\. It would be forever aflame;

Flames could be ignited without a cause.

Its beginning would be meaningless.

In that case, it would be without any action.

The second and third verses spell out the consequences of attributing
inherent existence to fire: It would be independent of all conditions,
including[]{#calibre_link-1657} its fuel; it would burn causelessly,
since there would be no condition under which it would not burn. So all
fire would, in that case, be eternal. Moreover, it would not consume
anything, having no connection to the presence or absence of fuel.
Moreover, Nāgārjuna asserts in the final two lines of X: 3, the activity
of starting a fire[]{#calibre_link-1658} would be nonsensical:

3\. Since it would not depend on another

Ignition would be without a cause.

If it were eternally in flames,

Starting it would be meaningless.

[]{#calibre_link-366}4. So, if one thinks that

That which is burning is the fuel,

If it is just this,

How is this fuel being burned?

Nāgārjuna now sets up a destructive dilemma:
Either[]{#calibre_link-1659} the process of burning is identical to the
fuel or different. In X: 4, he considers the possibility that they are
identical. If so, he suggests, we have a problem in explaining how the
fuel is consumed. The ordinary explanation of that is the presence of
fire. But by identifying the burning process with the fuel, we have left
the fire out of the picture. This analysis hence provides no
explanation[]{#calibre_link-1660} of combustion. After all, fuel by
itself does not burn. It must be ignited, that is, fire must be
introduced. If, as Nāgārjuna argues in X: 5, they are completely
different, there won't be any fire at all. For then the burning would be
dissociated from and independent of the fuel, and the unburned fuel
would not be consumed by the burning.[]{#calibre_link-1661} We could
make no sense of the transition from unburned to burned fuel. The
general moral is that we cannot make sense of interactive processes such
as combustion without attending to the mutual dependence of the
interacting phenomena that constitute those processes:

5\. If they are different, and if one not yet connected isn't connected,

The not yet burned will not be burned.

They will not cease.[]{#calibre_link-1662} If they do not cease

Then it will persist with its own characteristic.

6\. Just as a man and a woman

Connect to one another as man and woman,

So if fire were different from fuel,

Fire and fuel would have to be fit for connection.

Here the opponent suggests that just as males and females are suited to
connect in special ways in virtue of their particular anatomical
structures, despite existing[]{#calibre_link-1663} independently of one
another, fire and fuel may be similarly suited to some special kind of
connection. In that case, we would have the bizarre picture of fire
being independent of fuel, yet peculiarly suited to coming together with
[]{#calibre_link-477}it, and vice
versa.[]{#calibre_link-665}[^62^](#calibre_link-172){.nounder} Moreover,
since on this model fire and fuel are distinct from one another in
nature, yet interactive (they "preclude" each other in the
sense[]{#calibre_link-1664} that causes and effects preclude one
another---that is, in virtue of being connected yet incapable of
simultaneous copresence), there must still be some account of how they
connect, an account by no means easy to envisage:

7\. And, if fire and fuel

Preclude each other

Then fire being different from fuel,

It must still be asserted that they connect.

Fire and fuel hence appear to be mutually
dependent.[]{#calibre_link-1665} Indeed the central point of Nāgārjuna's
argument is that they are. But here the question arises: Don't they then
have either to depend upon some third more fundamental thing or to be
asymmetrically dependent, one of them established independently of the
other?

8\. If fire depends on fuel,

And fuel depends on fire,

On what are fire and[]{#calibre_link-1666} fuel established as
dependent?

Which one is established first?

If either is established as an entity first, without any reliance on the
existence or nature of the other, that member of the pair would have a
claim to being the basis in an asymmetrical dependency relation, and the
opponent would have the counterexample necessary to refute the analysis
in [Chapters VIII](#calibre_link-47){.nounder} and
[IX](#calibre_link-48){.nounder}. The most obvious[]{#calibre_link-1667}
form that such an asymmetric dependence could take would involve the
dependence of fire on fuel. Nāgārjuna argues that this is impossible to
maintain:

9\. If fire depends on fuel,

It would be the establishment of an established fire.

And the fuel could be fuel

Without any fire.

[]{#calibre_link-1668}There are two arguments here. In the first two
lines, Nā[]{#calibre_link-1669}gārjuna argues that if fire were to
depend upon fuel, fire would be doubly established. The point is that in
order for the fuel to count as fuel, the existence of the fire must have
already been established; indeed, the fuel depends upon the fire for its
character as fuel. So to say then that the fire is dependent upon the
fuel would be to argue that something whose[]{#calibre_link-1670}
existence is already presupposed if the fuel is to exist depends for its
existence on that fuel. Note that this is only problematic for the
opponent. That is, for one who accepts, as Nāgārjuna does, the mutual
interdependence of phenomena, it is in fact true that fire depends upon
fuel and that fuel depends upon fire. But the
opponent[]{#calibre_link-1671} at this stage in the argument argues that
fire exists only dependently, but dependently on independent fuel. So
Nāgārjuna only needs to show that position to be untenable. And the
problem for the opponent is simply that the fuel he wants to exist
independently can only do so in the presence of fire, which itself is
merely dependent.

[]{#calibre_link-1672}Second, Nāgārjuna argues, this would entail the
absurd independent establishment of fuel as fuel. For fuel to be
established independently as fuel in the absence of fire would be for
there to be some characteristic of fuel that could be specified
independently of fire that makes it fuel. But there is none. What makes
fuel fuel is that[]{#calibre_link-1673} it is combustible.

10\. If that on which an entity depends

Is established on the basis

Of the entity depending on it,

What is established in dependence on what?

So in order to establish the existence of fuel as fuel, we must
establish the existence of fire. In order for something to be fire, it
must be consuming fuel. Neither depends asymmetrically on the other.

11\. What entity is established[]{#calibre_link-1674} through
dependence?

If it is not established, then how could it depend?

However, if it is established merely through dependence,

That dependence makes no sense.

[]{#calibre_link-1675}Now Nāgārjuna draws the general ontological moral
from this discussion of the putative counterexample. If an entity is
inherently existent, it must be independently
established[]{#calibre_link-1676} as an entity and with its own nature.
So no entity could be established as inherently existent through
dependence on any other entity. Only inherently existent entities could
be independent. To establish something as inherently existent through
its dependence on something else is incoherent. So since entities can be
established neither through independence nor through dependence, there
is no[]{#calibre_link-1677} way to establish anything as an entity in
its own right.

12\. Fire is not dependent upon fuel.

Fire is not independent of fuel.

Fuel is not dependent upon fire.

Fuel is not independent of fire.

That is, neither fuel nor fire can be established as independent bases
of predication separate from one another that then stand in accidental
relations to one another. There are not two entities,
fire[]{#calibre_link-1678} and fuel, which then are related either by
dependence or interdependence.

13\. Fire does not come from something else,

Nor is fire in fuel itself.

Moreover, fire and the rest are just like

The moved, the not-moved, and the goer.

Though, as verse 12 grants, fire exists only in relation to fuel, it
would not be correct to assert that fuel as an independent entity
somehow produces fire. The analysis[]{#calibre_link-1679} and the
conclusion are strictly analogous to that regarding motion and the
mover. We neither can say that motion is the same as the mover nor that
they are different entities. We cannot say that motion is present in the
unmoved, the moving, or the yet-to-move. Similarly we cannot say that
fire is the same as the fuel nor that it is different. Nor can we say
that it is present in the unburned,[]{#calibre_link-1680} the burning,
or the yet-to-be-burned fuel. The next verse emphasizes this point:

[]{#calibre_link-405}14. Fuel is not fire.

Fire does not arise from anything different from fuel.

Fire does not possess fuel.

Fuel is not in fire, nor vice versa.

15\. Through discussion of fire and fuel,

The self and the aggregates, the pot and cloth

All together,

Without remainder have been explained.

The fire and fuel example[]{#calibre_link-1681} is used as an analogy
for a number of different cases of relations between bases and their
attributes, including the relation between the putative self and its
aggregates---that is, the components of the personality. But there are
other stock examples---the relation between the pot and its properties
and between the cloth and its thread---that are used to try to defend
these asymmetrical dependence relations[]{#calibre_link-1682} between
inherently existent bases and the properties they support. Nāgārjuna is
simply asserting the complete generality of this argument: It applies,
mutatis mutandis, to all of these cases.

16\. I do not think that

Those who teach that the self

Is the same as or different from the entities

Understand the meaning of the doctrine.

[]{#calibre_link-1683}This colophon verse reminds us that when existence
is understood in terms of emptiness and when entities are regarded as
purely relational in character, identity and difference can only be
understood conventionally. This applies not only with respect to
apparently distinct entities, but also to the relation between parts and
wholes, things and their attributes, events and their causes, and as
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1684}gārjuna emphasizes here, self and the objects of
awareness. Strict identity and difference as determined by reference to
phenomena themselves are only conceivable from the incoherent standpoint
of inherent existence.

subject, lacks inherent existence, and still one argued that nonetheless
it must do so in virtue of its impermanence and being subject to change.
Then, one might argue, birth, aging, and death must be real as the
conditions of the self's unreality. This is the
position[]{#calibre_link-1687} with which Nāgārjuna concerns himself in
this chapter. But he is also concerned with the generalization of this
question to the birth, aging, and death of all of cyclic
existence.[]{#calibre_link-667}[^63^](#calibre_link-174){.nounder} And
it is this more general problem with which he actually opens the
chapter, developing the account of individual impermanence as a special
case:[]{#calibre_link-668}[^64^](#calibre_link-175){.nounder}

[]{#calibre_link-486}1. When[]{#calibre_link-1688} asked about the
beginning,

The Great Sage said that nothing is known of
it.[]{#calibre_link-670}[^65^](#calibre_link-176){.nounder}

Cyclic existence is without end and beginning.

So there is no beginning or end.

The question about the existence and nature of the origin of the world
is one of the questions that Sakyamuni Buddha declared to be
unanswerable. Nāgārjuna here interprets that[]{#calibre_link-1689} to
mean that there is nothing coherent that can be said about the origin of
the world. Given the striking similarity between the questions that the
Buddha declared unanswerable and those that Kant argues to be
unanswerable by reason in the Antinomies of Pure Reason, there is much
to be said for this
diagnosis.[]{#calibre_link-671}[^66^](#calibre_link-177){.nounder} So
Nāgārjuna here claims[]{#calibre_link-1690} that we cannot
[]{#calibre_link-499}make sense of the beginning or end of all of cyclic
existence---beginnings and ends are beginnings and ends of actual,
conventionally designated and delimited processes within cyclic
existence.

2\. Where there is no beginning or end,

How could there be a middle?

It follows that thinking about this in terms of

Prior, posterior, and simultaneous is not appropriate.

The concept of[]{#calibre_link-1691} a middle, Nāgārjuna argues, is
bound up with those of beginnings and ends. We can say that we and all
phenomena are within cyclic existence, but to posit determinate absolute
spatiotemporal locations is senseless.

3\. If birth came first,

And then old age and death,

[]{#calibre_link-370}Then birth would be ageless and deathless,

And a deathless one would[]{#calibre_link-1692} be born.

Birth, old age, and death here are to be understood in an absolute
sense. Of course, conventionally, the birth of a particular human being
comes before her/his aging, which precedes her/his death. But that
should not lead us to think of that birth as the origin of an entity,
that aging as the midpoint in the life of that entity, or that death as
the end of that entity. If one adopts[]{#calibre_link-1693} a doctrine
of rebirth, as does Nāgārjuna and as do all of his interlocutors, the
point can be made quite straightforwardly: For any sentient continuum,
every birth is preceded by an aging and a death, and so forth.

But even setting aside the particular doctrine of rebirth, we can
elucidate this insight with equal force: To see
particular[]{#calibre_link-1694} entities as having determinate,
nonconventional beginnings of existence and determinate, nonconventional
termini and, hence, that there are distinct times at which there is a
clear fact of the matter about whether or not they exist, independent of
conventions for their individuation, is to see those entities as having
necessary and sufficient characteristics for their identity, that is, as
having[]{#calibre_link-1695} essences. But the central thesis Nāgārjuna
is defending is that this very conception of what it is to exist is
incoherent---that things are empty of such essences and that the
boundaries of objects are conventional and indeterminate. There is no
fixed boundary between the existence of a seed, the tree to which it
gives rise, a piece of[]{#calibre_link-1696} wood from that tree, and a
table fashioned therefrom or between the existence of an intact table, a
broken table, wooden table parts, ashes, earth, the nutrients for a
seed, that seed, the sapling to which it gives rise, and another tree.

Once we see the world from the standpoint of emptiness of inherent
existence, the history of any conventionally designated entity is but an
arbitrary stage[]{#calibre_link-1697} carved out of a vast continuum of
interdependent
phenomena.[]{#calibre_link-673}[^67^](#calibre_link-178){.nounder} The
arising of any phenomenon, human, []{#calibre_link-1698}nonhuman
sentient being, or inanimate object is the consequence of the
disintegration of others. That disintegration succeeds their arising and
aging. Once we give up the intrinsic identity of entities, the constant
cycle of death, birth, aging, and rebirth of entities is unavoidable.

4\. If birth[]{#calibre_link-1699} were to come after,

And old age and death first,

How could there be a causeless aging and death

Of one not born?

But birth has to precede death as well, on pain of the absurdity of
something that is unborn dying. And, as Nāgārjuna points out in the next
verse, we must think conventionally of these things in sequence because
any conventionally[]{#calibre_link-1700} designated object undergoes
them in order:

5\. Birth and age and death

Cannot occur at one time.

Then what is being born would be dying

And both would occur without cause.

6\. When the series of the prior, simultaneous, and posterior

Is not possible,

Why are you led to posit

This birth, aging, and death?

The birth, aging, and death that the opponent has in mind can be
represented at two[]{#calibre_link-1701} levels: At the most general
level, it is the birth, aging, and death of cyclic existence, the
examination of which frames this discussion. At that level, Nāgārjuna is
pointing out that []{#calibre_link-1702}these conceptions, having
legitimate employment only within the empirical realm, are nonsense. But
the opponent could also be interpreted as positing
birth,[]{#calibre_link-1703} aging, and death as determinate,
intrinsically identifiable moments in the evolution of empirical
phenomena or, specifically, of sentient beings. Nāgārjuna rejects that
as well, arguing that moments intrinsically prior to, simultaneous with,
or posterior to the existence of entities cannot be identified, given
the lack of intrinsic identity[]{#calibre_link-1704} of the entities
themselves. So long as one in conceiving of phenomena thinks of them as
temporally determinate and bounded, and thinks of the identity of things
as intrinsic to them, one will have to identify their beginnings,
middles, and ends. But this leads to paradox, given the
indeterminateness, interdependence, and interpenetration of things.
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1705}rjuna hence advises the rejection of this
ontology:

7\. Not only is cyclic existence itself without beginning,

No existent has a beginning:

Neither cause and effect;

Nor character and characterized ...

The alternative, both with respect to cyclic existence as a whole and
with respect to individual entities, is to reject the ontology of
entities and characteristics altogether, along with the
boundaries[]{#calibre_link-1706} and determinate relations that ontology
requires:

8\. Nor feeling and the feeler;

Whatever there is;

All entities

Are without beginning.

## **[]{#calibre_link-448 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-51 .calibre4}Chapter XII  Examination of Suffering** {#chapter-xii-examination-of-suffering-1 .h1}

The first of the Four Noble Truths is that "all this is suffering." So
one can imagine an interlocutor granting all that has gone before, but
in defense of Buddhist orthodoxy, insisting that suffering is inherently
existent. After all, the Four Noble Truths are, from a Buddhist
perspective, *truths.* Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1709}rjuna, of course, is a
Buddhist and accepts the Four Noble Truths. (In fact, the principal
chapter of this work, [Chapter XXIV](#calibre_link-63){.nounder}, is
devoted to an exposition of the Four Noble Truths from the standpoint of
emptiness and to the argument that only on Nāgārjuna's analysis can
these truths be maintained at all.) So he must, without denying
the[]{#calibre_link-1710} reality of suffering, explain its emptiness.

1\. Some say suffering is self-produced,

Or produced from another or from both.

Or that it arises without a cause.

It is not the kind of thing to be produced.

These are the four possibilities with regard to inherently existent
suffering. The echo of I: 1 is obvious, and the argument here will
depend heavily upon the analysis of dependent
arising[]{#calibre_link-1711} developed in that chapter and in Chapter
VII.

2\. If suffering came from itself,

Then it would not arise dependently.

[]{#calibre_link-449}For those aggregates

Arise in dependence on these aggregates.

Self-arising suffering would indeed be a candidate for inherent
existence. But for the proponent of a Buddhist analysis of suffering,
that is little help since suffering on a Buddhist analysis is the
consequence[]{#calibre_link-1712} of delusion, attachment, craving,
action, and so forth. So such an analysis is not open to anyone wanting
to defend the inherent existence of the suffering explored in the Four
Noble Truths.

3\. If those were different from these,

Or if these were different from those,

Suffering could arise from another.

These would arise from those others.

The next alternative---that suffering arises from
another---requires[]{#calibre_link-1713} that there be essential
difference. For since suffering does arise from previous conditions, if
there is genuine otherness, that would characterize the relation between
suffering and its grounds.

4\. If suffering were caused by a person himself,

Then who is that person---

By whom suffering is caused---

Who exists distinct from suffering?

But who is that other? It must be the sufferer himself
at[]{#calibre_link-1714} another stage, or another individual
altogether. If it is the person himself, then as the cause of suffering,
he must be distinct from suffering. This poses two problems: First, as
per the analysis of motion, desire, and agency in Chapters II, VI, and
VIII above, we cannot conceive of the sufferer as inherently different
from the suffering he experiences. For part of his identity is
constituted[]{#calibre_link-1715} by that very suffering, and that
suffering is his suffering. But second, given the framework of the first
of the Four Noble Truths, a Buddhist philosopher such as Nāgārjuna would
share with any Buddhist interlocutor the assumption that in samsāra
sentient beings not only suffer, but are literally
constituted[]{#calibre_link-1716} of suffering---that every aggregate of
a sentient being's existence is a cause, an effect, and a basis
[]{#calibre_link-532}of misery. So on either score, to distinguish
sufferer from suffering for the purpose of such an analysis would be
impossible.

5\. If suffering comes from another person,

Then who is that person---

When suffering is given by another---

Who exists distinct from suffering?

Another alternative is[]{#calibre_link-1717} that the suffering is
caused not by earlier stages of one's own life, but by another
individual. That other individual of course could be someone else
entirely, in the ordinary sense, or it could be an earlier moment of
what is ordinarily regarded as oneself, but which is for the purposes of
this analysis regarded as substantially other. That is, taken in this
way, Nā[]{#calibre_link-1718}gārjuna can be seen to be arguing on each
side of a dilemma with regard to the identity of persons across time.
But if this were so, it would have to be the case that the person in
whom suffering was caused by that other could be identified and that
that person could be distinguished from her suffering. But then the same
problems developed above apply. Nā[]{#calibre_link-1719}gārjuna
emphasizes this in XII:
6:[]{#calibre_link-1720}[^68^](#calibre_link-180){.nounder}

6\. If another person causes suffering,

Who is that other one

Who bestowed that suffering,

Distinct from suffering?

7\. When self-caused is not established,

How could suffering be caused by another?

Whoever caused the suffering of another

Must have caused his own suffering.

But the suffering of that other person must either[]{#calibre_link-1721}
be caused by someone else or be self-caused. The former alternative
leads to a regress: The whole point from the standpoint of the opponent
who is the target of this argument is to find the independent
explanatory []{#calibre_link-538}ground for suffering. The second
alternative leads back to the problem scouted in the opening verses:
Self-caused suffering is both inconceivable within a general Buddhist
soteriological[]{#calibre_link-1722} framework and runs afoul of the
arguments against self-causation generally. Finally, it is rather
embarrassingly ad hoc. Nāgārjuna sums this up in the next verse:

8\. No suffering is self-caused.

Nothing causes itself.

If another is not self-made,

How could suffering be caused by another?

But, as Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1723}rjuna points out in XII: 9, it can't
be caused by both since we have seen that neither can be causally
relevant at all to inherently existent suffering of a kind relevant to
Buddhist doctrine. And it is absurd to suppose that it is uncaused:

9\. If suffering were caused by each,

Suffering could be caused by both.

Not caused by self or by other,

How could suffering be uncaused?

10\. Not only[]{#calibre_link-1724} does suffering not exist

In any of the fourfold ways:

No external entity exists

In any of the fourfold ways.

The fourfold analysis is, of course, that in terms of the tetralemma of
causation. And Nāgārjuna is simply emphasizing that this refutation of
the existence of inherently existing suffering is perfectly general. No
entity can[]{#calibre_link-1725} arise from itself, from another, from
both, or from a noncause. This was the burden of the first chapter. We
must, of course, recall that this is not a refutation of the existence
of the suffering we all experience and wish to avoid. Rather it is a
demonstration of its emptiness of inherent existence. For just as the
analysis in Chapter I has provided the key to dismissing the inherent
existence[]{#calibre_link-1726} of suffering, the positive side of that
same analysis can be used to recover its conventional existence. If by
suffering we mean something dependently arisen, impermanent,
[]{#calibre_link-539}and conventional, existing only as imputed and only
in relation to its empty subjects, there is plenty of suffering to go
around.

But moreover, not only is the existence of suffering rendered
comprehensible on this analysis,[]{#calibre_link-1727} but so is the
possibility of the alleviation of suffering. For if the proponent of the
inherent existence of suffering were correct, while it might seem that
suffering would then have a more solid status than that vouchsafed it by
Nāgārjuna's analysis in terms of emptiness, that very substantial
existence and hence independence of other[]{#calibre_link-1728}
conditions would make its alleviation impossible. For if it exists
independently, then there are no conditions in the absence of which it
fails to exist. So Nāgārjuna's analysis not only makes good sense of the
first truth---that of suffering---and by implication of the
second---that of the cause of suffering---but also opens the door for
an[]{#calibre_link-1729} analysis of the third and fourth truths---those
of cessation and of the means to cessation.

## **[]{#calibre_link-361 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-52 .calibre4}Chapter XIII  Examination of Compounded Phenomena** {#chapter-xiii-examination-of-compounded-phenomena-1 .h1}

In this chapter, Nāgārjuna begins to develop the idea of emptiness more
explicitly. Up to this point, he has been arguing that phenomena are
empty, but has not been characterizing emptiness itself, or its relation
to entitihood or to conventional reality, except by example and by
implication.[]{#calibre_link-1732} At this point, through a general
discussion of all compounded phenomena---that is, all phenomena
constituted of parts or brought into being dependent upon causes---he
argues explicitly both that emptiness is the lack of essence and that
emptiness itself is wholly negative in character. It is not an essence
that things have instead of whatever essence naive common sense or
sophisticated reification[]{#calibre_link-1733} might have thought they
had---rather, it is the total lack of essence or inherent existence.
This is, hence, an anticipation of the explicit discussions of the
emptiness of emptiness to follow.

1\. The Victorious Conqueror has said that whatever

Is deceptive is false.

Compounded
phenomena[]{#calibre_link-676}[^69^](#calibre_link-182){.nounder} are
all deceptive.

Therefore they are all false.

[]{#calibre_link-380}This is an important verse for any understanding of
the[]{#calibre_link-1734} relation of the two truths---the conventional
and the ultimate---to one another. That relation is vexed because the
conventional truth is sometimes referred to as a truth and sometimes as
wholly false. Conventional phenomena are sometimes referred to as
empirically real and not imaginary and sometimes as wholly
imaginary.[]{#calibre_link-677}[^70^](#calibre_link-183){.nounder} So it
is important to see that the sense of "falsehood" in play when the
conventional[]{#calibre_link-1735} is characterized as false is
"deceptive." That is, insofar as conventional phenomena present
themselves as more than conventional---as inherently existent---they
deceive us. We take them to be what they are not---to be intrinsically
identified, inherently existent entities. In that sense, they are false.
But to the extent that we understand them as dependently arisen, empty,
interdependent phenomena,[]{#calibre_link-1736} they constitute a
conventional truth. Yet one must bear in mind that, according to
Nāgārjuna, perception untutored by Mādhyamika philosophy and rigorous
practice delivers objects to consciousness as inherently existent. In
*this* sense, the things that we see are wholly false. For most of us,
the best that[]{#calibre_link-1737} we can do is reason our way into
knowing, but not seeing, their true nature. The goal of meditation on
emptiness is to bring this knowledge into perceptual experience and,
hence, to see things as they are.

2\. If whatever is deceptive is false,

What deceives?

The Victorious
Conqueror[]{#calibre_link-678}[^71^](#calibre_link-184){.nounder} has
said about this

That emptiness is completely true.

[]{#calibre_link-351}The opponent then asks what we are deceived
about.[]{#calibre_link-1738} Here is what motivates the question: If
there are no real tables, for instance, then when I believe that there
is a table in front of me and am therefore deceived, what is deceiving
me? We don't want to say that a nonexistent phenomenon is pretending to
be existent since it would have to exist in order to pretend. Nāgārjuna
replies that[]{#calibre_link-1739} what actually exists is an empty
table. (That is not to say, however, that that empty table is
*inherently existent*---only that the correct way to characterize the
entity that exists conventionally is as an "empty table.") That empty
table is misperceived by an ordinary mind as a truly existent table. To
the extent that it appears *as empty,* it appears as it truly is. In the
first two lines of the[]{#calibre_link-1740} next verse, Nāgārjuna notes
that it is the absence of essence that permits change:

3\. All things lack entity (hood),

Since change is perceived.

There is nothing without entity

Because all things have emptiness.

It is emptiness that makes change possible. If things had essences, they
would be incapable of real change. But since they[]{#calibre_link-1741}
are seen to change, Nāgārjuna argues, they must be empty of essence. The
opponent, though, rejoins: Since according to Nāgārjuna all things are
empty and since this is their ultimate nature, all things in fact do
have a kind of entitihood, namely, *existence as empty
phenomena.*[]{#calibre_link-1742} Nāgārjuna is here anticipating the
charge that he has rejected *other* essences only to posit emptiness as
an essence, subject to all of the problems he has already adumbrated for
essentialist metaphysics.

The opponent then asks (XIII: 4), "If everything lacks being, and is
therefore empty, what could change?" Change would seem to
have[]{#calibre_link-1743} to be change of something, and the doctrine
of emptiness seems to rob us of those somethings. Nāgārjuna, hence,
presents himself, in the voice of the opponent, with a dilemma: He seems
to have propounded, his protestations to the contrary notwithstanding, a
theory of the essence of all phenomena. That theory, according to this
hypothetical[]{#calibre_link-1744} objection, is that emptiness just is
the essence []{#calibre_link-464}of all phenomena. He could deny having
propounded such a theory, of course. But the consequence of such a
denial, the opponent charges, would be no better. For then, the very
basis of the argument here offered for emptiness---the reality of
change---would have to be rejected. This is because without real
entities there would no longer be a possible[]{#calibre_link-1745}
subject of change. Nāgārjuna replies in the third and fourth lines of
XIII: 4 that the opponent has things backward: If there was
entitihood---if things were nonempty---change would be impossible. It is
emptiness itself that makes change comprehensible:

4\. If there is no entity (hood),

What changes?

If there were entity,

How could it[]{#calibre_link-1746} be correct that something changes?

Now Nāgārjuna begins a brief explanation of how to understand change in
the context of emptiness and of why entitihood would preclude change.
This discussion is certainly grounded in the analysis in Chapter II, but
is more explicitly tied to the doctrine of emptiness at this point in
the text:

5\. A[]{#calibre_link-1747} thing itself does not change.

Something different does not change.

Because a young man doesn't grow old,

And because and an old man doesn't grow old either.

When we imagine change, we imagine one thing retaining its identity, but
changing its properties. But if identity is understood strictly, it is
only possible as an internal relation that a thing bears to itself. To
the extent that a thing[]{#calibre_link-1748} changes, it becomes,
strictly speaking, a different thing. But the relation between two
things is not the change of a thing---it is simply the difference
between two nonchanging entities. A young man does not grow old. When he
is old he is no longer a young man. The relation between the young man
and the old man is simply the difference of two things. But an old man
doesn't grow old either. He is[]{#calibre_link-1749} already old. So if
change []{#calibre_link-417}and things that change are thought of
nonrelationally, we can make no sense of change at all.

6\. If a thing itself changed,

Milk itself would be curd.

Or curd would have come to be

An entity different from milk.

If we think of identity persisting through change, there is a single
thing that changes as conventionally, milk becomes curd. Since that
thing is identical[]{#calibre_link-1750} to milk and to curd, by
transitivity we would have to say that curd and milk are identical. But
no one would want to put curd in his/her tea! The only way to avoid this
result while retaining the idea that milk and curd are entities would be
to consider them to be wholly different entities. In that case, there is
still no change in an entity---only the difference between two unrelated
phenomena.[]{#calibre_link-680}[^72^](#calibre_link-185){.nounder}

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1751}
:::

7\. If there were even a trifle nonempty,

Emptiness itself would be but a trifle.

But not even a trifle is nonempty.

How could emptiness be an entity?

Verses 7 and 8 are critical for any understanding of the subtle doctrine
Nāgārjuna is developing of the emptiness of emptiness. In XIII: 7,
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1752}rjuna is emphasizing that emptiness is not one
of the many properties that a thing might or might not have. It is not
that some things are empty and some are nonempty, or that all things
happen to be empty although they might have been otherwise. Emptiness is
important because it is the only way that things can exist. Moreover,
emptiness is not an entity. It is not a distinct phenomenon to
which[]{#calibre_link-1753} other phenomena are related. It is exactly
[]{#calibre_link-302}the emptiness of all
phenomena.[]{#calibre_link-682}[^73^](#calibre_link-186){.nounder} The
conventional character of conventional entities and their emptiness are
one and the same.

8\. The victorious ones have said

That emptiness is the relinquishing of all views.

For whomever emptiness is a view,

That one will accomplish nothing.

The sense of "view" (Tib: *lta-ba,* Skt: *dṛ≐⃛i)*[]{#calibre_link-1754}
at work in verse 8 is crucial. By a view, Nāgārjuna here means a theory
on the same level of discourse at which reificationist-nihilist debates
proceed. A view in this sense is a view about what does or does not
exist when existence is taken to mean inherent existence, or about the
nature of phenomena, presupposing that the idea of
a[]{#calibre_link-1755} nature is coherent. So both the theory that
compounded phenomena exist in virtue of having natures and identities
and the theory that since they don't have such natures and identities
they don't exist at all are views in this sense. Both presuppose that
things exist at all if and only if they do so inherently. But the
analysis in terms of emptiness is not a view at all in this sense. For
the claim[]{#calibre_link-1756} is *not* that things exist in virtue of
having the property of emptiness as an essence. Rather it is the claim
that they are empty *because* they have *no* essence.

It is also very important to see that this understanding of what a view
is is closely bound up with Nāgārjuna's account of assertion and of the
role of language in Mā[]{#calibre_link-1757}dhyamika dialectic. For
Nāgārjuna, assertion in the literal sense is always the ascription of a
property to an entity. As long as we are talking from the conventional
standpoint, there is no problem here. There are plenty of conventional
entities and conventional properties to go around and, so, lots of
available conventionally true assertions.[]{#calibre_link-1758} That is
the basis of conventional truth. It is also important to note here that
[]{#calibre_link-295}corresponding to these conventional assertions are
real propositions that make them true or false---entities with or
without the ascribed properties. Again, as long as we remain and are
aware that we remain within the framework of conventional designation
and conventional assertion, this poses no problems.

But, when[]{#calibre_link-1759} we start to do metaphysics, it is easy
to slip into nonsense: For now, when we want to characterize the essence
of a thing, we take ourselves to be positing a non-conventional thing
and ascribing to it an essential property. And there not only are no
such things, but there are not even *possibly* such things. There is no
ultimate *way the world is* that we are characterizing, truly or
falsely.

The[]{#calibre_link-1760} danger to which Nāgārjuna is here adverting
with respect to Mādhyamika philosophy (of treating Mādhyamika as a view)
is then connected to assertion in the following way: If one were to
think that in asserting that things are empty that one is positing
entities and ascribing to[]{#calibre_link-1761} those independent
entities the property of emptiness, one would be treating the language
of Mādhyamika as making literal assertions. But from the standpoint from
which these would be true, there are no entities and no characteristics,
and a fortiori, there are no entities having the characteristic of being
empty. The language must hence be understood, from the
ultimate[]{#calibre_link-1762} perspective, not as making assertions,
but rather as ostending---indicating that which cannot be literally
asserted without falling into nonsense---as Wittgenstein puts it in the
*Tractatus,* showing that which cannot be said.

Nāgārjuna makes this much more explicit in his discussion of
positionlessness in *Vigrahavyā[]{#calibre_link-1763}vartanī*
XXI-XXVIII, where he explicitly denies that the Mādhyamika assert any
propositions, in virtue of there being no entities or properties
presupposed by their use of language existing independently and
corresponding to the words used. Āryadeva makes the same point at
*Catuḥ*śā*taka* XVI: 21. Candrakīrti in his[]{#calibre_link-1764}
comments on these verses compares one who treats emptiness as an
essential property---as opposed to the lack of any essential property,
thus treating Mādhyamika language as assertoric in the sense of
asserting the view that all things have the essential nature of
emptiness---to one who, upon entering a shop []{#calibre_link-501}and
learning that there are no wares for sale, asks the
shopkeeper[]{#calibre_link-1765} to sell him the "no
wares."[]{#calibre_link-684}[^74,^](#calibre_link-187){.nounder}
[]{#calibre_link-685}[^75^](#calibre_link-188){.nounder}

To hold a view of emptiness---to reify it and then attribute it to
phenomena---would then involve simultaneously reifying those phenomena
as having a fixed nature and denying their existence at all, in virtue
of disparaging their conventional reality as unreality by contrast with
the reality of emptiness. It is this incoherence, so characteristic of
essentialist[]{#calibre_link-1766} philosophies, that leads Nāgārjuna to
assert that one holding such a view is completely hopeless---incapable
of accomplishing anything, philosophically or
soteriologically.[]{#calibre_link-686}[^76,^](#calibre_link-189){.nounder}
[]{#calibre_link-687}[^77^](#calibre_link-190){.nounder}

[]{#calibre_link-420}This argument against the coherence of any
understanding of emptiness as itself an essence is tied very tightly to
the analysis in Chapter XXIV: 18-40 of the[]{#calibre_link-1767}
emptiness of emptiness and of the connection between emptiness,
dependent arising, and convention and tied most directly to the
concluding verse of the text, XXVII: 30. (The commentaries on XXIV: 36
and XXVII: 30 below may be useful in elucidating this verse as well.) It
is clearly an early anticipation of the powerful and climactic
conclusions drawn in those two discussions.

## **[]{#calibre_link-367 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-53 .calibre4}Chapter XIV  Examination of Connection** {#chapter-xiv-examination-of-connection-1 .h1}

The word here translated as "connection" *(phrad-pa)* is the term
denoting the relation between the components that are compounded in any
compounded phenomenon. It can also describe the relation between two
things coming together in space and time or colliding, or two things
fitting together, and while this can be taken fairly literally in the
context of physical[]{#calibre_link-1770} objects when they are
understood as compounded of their parts, the relation is actually much
more general than that. In fact, the example that Nāgārjuna takes as
central, and one that is used by some earlier Buddhist theorists as an
example of a case of connection in this sense, is visual perception. In
such a case, according to the proponent[]{#calibre_link-1771} of the
reality of meeting, or compounding, the subject, the sensory organs, the
sensory faculty, and the object join together, or "connect," not in a
literal physical sense of spatiotemporal coincidence, but rather in the
sense of forming an ensemble. Sense perception is, on this view, the
entire compound ensemble.

So, dialectically, this chapter follows quite naturally on the heels of
the examination[]{#calibre_link-1772} of compounded entities. For we can
imagine an opponent might reason as follows: Nāgārjuna may be right in
denying the inherent existence of compounded entities in virtue of their
dependence upon their parts and upon their parts being compounded, but
surely since these phenomena depend upon being
[]{#calibre_link-406}compounded that relation---the
connection---exists.[]{#calibre_link-1773} This chapter is aimed at
replying to this position.

1\. The seen, seeing, and the seer:

These three---pairwise or

All together---

Do not connect to one another.

First, he claims, these things simply don't occur in the same place at
the same time. There is no literal sense in which they connect.

2\. Similarly desire, the desirous one, the object of desire,

And the remaining afflictions

And the[]{#calibre_link-1774} remaining sources of perception

Are understood in this threefold way.

In the various chapters on the relation between characteristic and
characterized, Nāgārjuna has argued that it makes no sense to think of
the relation between individuals and their properties or between
entities as any kind of relation between independent
entities[]{#calibre_link-1775} at all, and that these phenomena cannot
be understood as the same, as different, or as neither.

3\. Since different things connect to one another,

But in seeing, etc.,

There is no difference,

They cannot connect.

In order to have things that connect in the relevant sense, they must be
different from one another, but as we saw in the chapters on
characteristics, on desire, on seeing, on action,[]{#calibre_link-1776}
on motion, and on the self, the differences of the relevant kind are not
found on analysis.

4\. Not only in seeing, etc . . .

Is there no such difference:

When one thing and another are simultaneous,

It is also not tenable that there is difference.

[]{#calibre_link-1777}This problem emerges not only in the analysis of
intuitively unitary phenomena like vision, but is perfectly general.
Things that are separate[]{#calibre_link-1778} from one another cannot
be coherently thought of as inherently different entities either. For
without any inherent identity, there is no basis for inherent
difference. This recalls the argument of Chapter I.

5\. A different thing depends on a different thing for its difference.

Without a different thing, a different thing wouldn't be different.

It is not tenable for that which depends on
something[]{#calibre_link-1779} else

To be different from it.

For there to be substantial difference, it must be possible to
independently establish the identity and natures of the relata. But
this, Nāgārjuna has argued repeatedly, is impossible.

6\. If a different thing were different from a different thing,

Without a different thing, a different thing could exist.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1780}
:::

But without that different thing, that different thing does not exist.

It follows that it doesn't exist.

That is, the only way that difference or the identity of a different
thing as different could be shown to exist inherently would be for that
difference to be present independently of the existence of another
different thing. But that is not so. The only alternative would be to
argue that[]{#calibre_link-1781} difference is present independently in
single things. But this ignores the relational character of difference.

7\. Difference is not in a different thing.

Nor is it in a nondifferent thing.

If difference does not exist,

Neither different nor identical things exist.

So difference cannot be located either as a relation between things or
as a unary property of individual things. So there is
no[]{#calibre_link-1782} inherently existent difference. But it is the
existence of inherent []{#calibre_link-362}difference that grounds the
problem of connection. So there is no such relation, and no problem to
be solved.

8\. That does not connect to itself.

Nor do different things connect to one another.

Neither connection nor

Connected nor connector exist.

The conclusion is a powerful one and, especially when conjoined with the
conclusion[]{#calibre_link-1783} of the previous chapter, goes to the
heart of any Buddhist (or non-Buddhist, for that matter) ontology that
seeks to reify the entities that appear at any stage of ontological
analysis. It is quite tempting when examining dependent, compound
phenomena to think that while they themselves might not be inherently
existent, and might not be the ultimate entities of the empirical world,
it must[]{#calibre_link-1784} at least be a fundamental fact that their
being constituted of parts, or dependent upon their location in a causal
and mereological nexus, exists as a fact. That would seem, in fact, to
be the natural way to interpret the doctrine of dependent origination
and the emptiness of macroscopic entities. But Nāgārjuna here pulls the
rug out[]{#calibre_link-1785} from any such analysis, pointing again to
the emptiness of emptiness: Not only are compounded phenomena empty of
inherent existence, but so is the relation among their constituents and
determinants in virtue of which they are compounded.

## **[]{#calibre_link-312 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-54 .calibre4}Chapter XV  Examination of Essence** {#chapter-xv-examination-of-essence-1 .h1}

This chapter continues the discussion begun in Chapter XIII and carried
on in Chapter XIV of the fundamental nature of things and the relation
between emptiness and existence. Here Nāgārjuna rejects the coherence of
the concept of essence and explores its ramifications for the concept of
inherent existence,[]{#calibre_link-1788} the concept of an entity, and
the concept of a nonentity. This chapter is also aimed at dispelling any
nihilistic interpretation of the Mādhyamika philosophical orientation
and in explaining the deep connection between the analysis of phenomena
as empty of essence and the demonstration of the possibility of
empirical reality.

1\. Essence arising from

Causes and conditions[]{#calibre_link-1789} makes no sense.

If essence came from causes and conditions,

Then it would be fabricated.

Essence by definition is eternal and independent. So it can't arise
dependently. Chapter XV: 1, 2 develop this point directly. But since all
entities arise dependently, it follows that none of them have
essence.[]{#calibre_link-689}[^78^](#calibre_link-193){.nounder}

[]{#calibre_link-418}2. How could it be appropriate

For fabricated essence to come to be?

Essence itself is[]{#calibre_link-1790} not artificial

And does not depend on another.\

In these first two verses, Nāgārjuna indicates the three cardinal
characteristics of an essence: An essence (or an entity that exists in
virtue of possessing an essence) is uncaused, independent of other
phenomena, and not fabricated from other things. It is important to bear
this in mind[]{#calibre_link-1791} in any Mādhyamika analysis of
emptiness. For when Nāgārjuna argues that phenomena are all empty, it is
*of* essence in this sense that they are empty. Hence, when Nāgārjuna
argues that all phenomena originate in dependence upon conditions, that
all[]{#calibre_link-1792} phenomena are interdependent, and that all
phenomena are fabricated (both in virtue of being compounded from parts
and in virtue of acquiring their identity as particulars through
conceptual imputation), he is thereby arguing quite directly for their
emptiness.

3\. If there is no essence,

How can there be difference in entities?

The essence of difference in entities

Is what is called the entity[]{#calibre_link-1793} of difference.

This is an echo of the argument about difference presented in Chapter I.
Essential difference presupposes essences of individuals. So any
argument against individual essence will count as an argument against
essential difference.

4\. Without having essence or otherness-essence,

How can there be entities?

If there are essences and entities

Entities are established.

The concept[]{#calibre_link-1794} of an inherently existent entity is
the concept of an entity with an essence. So without essence, there are
no inherently existing entities.

[]{#calibre_link-439}5. If the entity is not established,

A nonentity is not established.

An entity that has become different.

Is a nonentity, people say.

By a nonentity, Nāgārjuna means something inherently
different[]{#calibre_link-1795} from some existing entity. A nontable in
this sense would be inherently different from a table. But a nonexistent
in general would be a Meinongian subsistent which is available as a
basis of predication but is intrinsically different from what it is to
be an existent---a real thing possessed of the property of being
nonexistent. Just as a table must be established as a determinate entity
in order[]{#calibre_link-1796} to establish the nature of nontables,
existence must be established as an inherently existent property in
order to establish the parallel status of nonexistence. But neither
tables nor existence can be so established. By the same token, then,
there are no inherently established nontables, nor any inherently
established nonexistents in their stead. So even though it might appear
that an analysis[]{#calibre_link-1797} through emptiness would leave us
only with nontables and nonexistent phenomena, it doesn't even leave us
with that (inherently), though it leaves us with plenty of tables,
nontables, existents, and nonexistents (conventionally).

6\. Those who see essence and essential difference

And entities and nonentities,

They do not see

The truth taught by the Buddha.

If the only way that one can think[]{#calibre_link-1798} about phenomena
is to think of them as things with inherent natures and to think of
things without such natures as thereby nonexistent, none of the Buddhist
doctrines of impermanence, emptiness, or liberation will make any sense.

7\. The Victorious One, through knowledge

Of reality and unreality,

In the *Discourse to Kātyāyana*,

Refuted[]{#calibre_link-1799} both "it is" and "it is not."

[]{#calibre_link-352}In the *Discourse to Kātyāyana,* the Buddha argues
that to assert that things exist inherently is to fall into the extreme
of reification, to argue that things do not exist at all is to fall into
the extreme of nihilism, and to follow the middle way is neither to
assert in an unqualified way that things exist[]{#calibre_link-1800} nor
in an unqualified way that things do not exist. It represents one of the
fundamental *suttas* of the Pali canon for Mahāyāna philosophy. In the
*sutta,* the Buddha claims that reification derives from the failure to
note impermanence and leads to grasping, craving, and the attendant
suffering. Nihilism, he claims, is motivated by
the[]{#calibre_link-1801} failure to note the empirical reality of
arising phenomena. It leads to suffering from failure to take life,
others, and morality seriously enough. The middle path of conventional
existence leads to engagement in the world without
attachment.[]{#calibre_link-691}[^79^](#calibre_link-194){.nounder}

8\. If existence were through essence,

Then there would be no nonexistence.

A change in essence

Could never be tenable.

If for a thing to exist were[]{#calibre_link-1802} for it to be a
determinate entity with an essence, then no thing would ever cease to
exist or change in any way. For an essential property is a necessary
property, and it is incoherent to say that a thing loses a necessary
property.

9\. If there is no essence,

What could become other?

If there is essence,

What could become other?

In the first half of this verse, the opponent replies that
since[]{#calibre_link-1803} the argument in the previous verse
presupposes the reality of change, []{#calibre_link-508}it must
presuppose the reality of the changer. If it presupposes the reality of
change, it presupposes the reality of things that change and, hence,
that persist through time. In order to remain the same, there must be
some essence that accounts for this identity.
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1804}rjuna replies, however, that if this
persistence through time were determined by essence, the change it
putatively explains would be impossible. Only conventional existence
over time can explain change. Nāgārjuna summarizes, paraphrasing the
*Discourse to Kātyāyana:*

10\. To say[]{#calibre_link-1805} "it is" is to grasp for permanence.

To say "it is not" is to adopt the view of nihilism.

Therefore a wise person

Does not say "exists" or "does not exist."

11\. "Whatever exists through its essence

Cannot be nonexistent" is eternalism.

"It existed before but doesn't now"

Entails the error of
nihilism.[]{#calibre_link-693}[^80^](#calibre_link-195){.nounder}

To say that if something exists, it does so in virtue of having an
essence and hence[]{#calibre_link-1806} cannot change or pass out of
existence would entail the absurd position that everything is eternal.
To say of something that it existed in this strong sense---with an
essence---in the past, but does not do so now, is absurd. For if for
something to exist is for it to do so inherently, and if it is not now
existent, it could never have been. So since everything we observe is
impermanent, if the only existence[]{#calibre_link-1807} that there
could be were inherent existence, nothing could exist at all. That would
be nihilism. The upshot of this chapter is that the very concept of an
essence, and hence the very concept of an inherently existent entity at
all, is incoherent. No coherent conception of the phenomenal world can
be one in which things are posited other than
conventionally.[]{#calibre_link-694}[^81^](#calibre_link-196){.nounder}

## []{#calibre_link-314 .calibre4}Chapter XVI  Examination of Bondage {#calibre_link-55 .h1}

So there are no entities. But still, from a Buddhist perspective, we are
bound: bound to our conceptions of entities and essence, bound to our
selves, bound to objects, and principally, bound to cyclic existence
itself. Surely, the opponent might ask, mustn't the bondage that
accounts for the illusions so ruthlessly analyzed in the previous
chapter be intrinsically[]{#calibre_link-1810} real? If not, what is the
causal basis for all of these illusions and all of this suffering? In a
Buddhist framework, this bondage to cyclic existence is instantiated in
endless transmigration in saṃsāra, and freedom from bondage would be
liberation from cyclic existence into nirvāṇa. We will
postpone[]{#calibre_link-1811} a discussion of the precise nature of
that liberation and of nirvāṇa until we reach the chapters where that
topic is discussed, namely, XXII and XXV. Nāgārjuna begins with an
examination of transmigration and the entity that transmigrates:

1\. If compounded phenomena
transmigrate,[]{#calibre_link-696}[^82^](#calibre_link-198){.nounder}

They[]{#calibre_link-1812} do not transmigrate as permanent.

[]{#calibre_link-353}If they are impermanent they do not transmigrate.

The same approach applies to sentient beings.

Nāgārjuna sets up a by now familiar destructive dilemma: Either
compounded phenomena---of which sentient beings, the beings who are
bound, are instances---are permanent or impermanent. Let us just
consider the[]{#calibre_link-1813} compounded phenomena who are sentient
and hence who transmigrate: If they are thought of as permanent, they
cannot transmigrate because transmigration involves, by definition,
change. And what is permanent, as we have seen, cannot change. But if
they are impermanent, then they do not endure through time and, hence,
cannot transmigrate. So no sentient being considered as an inherent
entity can be[]{#calibre_link-1814} conceived of as a transmigrator in
cyclic existence.

2\. If someone transmigrates,

Then if, when sought in the fivefold way

In the aggregates and in the sense spheres and in the elements,

He is not there, what transmigrates?

Given that no inherently existent person can be found upon analysis as
the bearer of the aggregates, as identical to the aggregates, as
different from the aggregates,[]{#calibre_link-1815} as the collection
of the aggregates, or as the arrangement of the aggregates, and mutatis
mutandis for other possible modes of analysis in terms of domains of
knowledge or experience and in terms of basic elements, it follows that
there is no inherently existent subject of transmigration. If the
transmigrator cannot be identified on analysis, though, neither can the
transmigration itself. It will[]{#calibre_link-1816} follow that there
is no inherently existent transmigration and, hence, no inherently
existent bondage to cyclic existence.

3\. If one transmigrates from
grasping[]{#calibre_link-698}[^83^](#calibre_link-199){.nounder} to
grasping, then

One would be nonexistent.

Neither existent nor grasping,

Who could this transmigrator be?

[]{#calibre_link-513}"Grasping" here refers primarily to grasping the
aggregates as one's self. Transmigration---or for that matter
continuation[]{#calibre_link-1817} within one life, which from the
Mādhyamika perspective is exactly the same kind of process---involves
moving from grasping one set of phenomena as one's self to grasping
another in the same way. That is one of the most fundamental delusions
from a Buddhist standpoint. But grasping can also be the grasping of an
object as an object, or the clinging to possessions.
Life[]{#calibre_link-1818} in saṃsāra, Nāgārjuna would insist, can
equally well be characterized in any of these ways. But if in order to
exist as an individual one would have to retain one's identity over time
since on this view it is of the very nature of cyclic existence that one
constantly changes from one moment[]{#calibre_link-1819} to another,
then it would follow that no subject exists. But if there is no subject
of grasping, there can be no grasping. So, on the supposition that to
exist and to transmigrate is to exist as a continuing entity, there is
no way to make sense of the phenomenal world. So an inherently existent
grasper, posited in order to guarantee the reality of cyclic existence,
in fact makes the reality of[]{#calibre_link-1820} cyclic existence
incoherent.

4\. How could compounded phenomena pass into nirvāṇa?

That would not be tenable.

How could a sentient being pass into nirvāṇa?

That would not be tenable.

If compounded phenomena are permanent, grasping is permanent. And if
grasping is permanent, saṃsā[]{#calibre_link-1821}ra is permanent. And
if saṃsāra is permanent, then nirvāṇa is impossible. But the philosopher
who is positing inherently existent bondage is doing so in order to
defend a Buddhist perspective on cyclic existence and nirvāṇa. This is
precisely the motivation[]{#calibre_link-1822} for the reification---the
worry that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are, if not inherently existent,
nonexistent. So this conclusion is inadmissible for such an opponent.

5\. All compounded phenomena are arising and ceasing things:

Not bound, not released.

For this reason a sentient being

Is not bound, not released.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1823}
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1824}Neither bondage nor release can be seen as
inherently existent, nor as inherent properties of sentient beings. This
is the conclusion of the argument that follows. Nāgārjuna first
considers bondage as an inherent property, and then liberation:

6\. If grasping were bondage,

Then the one who is grasping would not be bound.

But one who[]{#calibre_link-1825} is not grasping is not bound.

In what circumstances will one be bound?

If grasping is identified with the property of bondage, then the
continuity of bondage across transmigration is inexplicable: The problem
is that grasping is not only the cause, but is also the effect of
bondage. Delusion by which we are bound, from a Buddhist perspective,
leads us to grasp at things; that grasping
perpetuates[]{#calibre_link-1826} delusion and bondage. To the extent
that we grasp onto external phenomena or onto the self as inherently
existent, we are bound to the delusions that constitute and ground
saṃsāra. To the extent that we are bound in delusion, we continue to
grasp. The bondage is hence not only conditioned by, but overarches,
particular instances of grasping. But[]{#calibre_link-1827} we don't
want to infer from the fact that grasping and bondage are not identical
that the relinquishing of all grasping would not free one. The task is
then to figure out the nature of bondage, which must be conceived as
relational.

7\. If prior to binding

There is a bound one,

There would be bondage, but there isn't.

The rest has been explained by the gone, the not-gone, and the goer.

The[]{#calibre_link-1828} only way that bondage itself could be an
inherently existent phenomenon would be if it could exist prior to and
independently of a bound sentient being. But then the case would be
strictly analogous to motion (as well as to several other analysands we
have considered so far). That is, just as there is no motion apart from
the mover, there is no bondage apart from the bound. The argument can be
applied[]{#calibre_link-1829} in a strictly parallel way.

[]{#calibre_link-518}8. Whoever is bound is not released.

Whoever is not bound does not get released.

If a bound one were being released,

Bondage and release would occur simultaneously.

Nāgārjuna then recalls another argument from Chapter II, the argument
against the possibility of the beginning of motion. There,
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1830}gārjuna argued that motion could not begin in a
stationary object since it is not moving, nor in a moving object since
it is already in motion. And there can be no moment when a thing is both
moving and stationary, nor any moment when an entity is neither.
Similarly, nirvāṇa cannot arise in one in saṃsā[]{#calibre_link-1831}ra,
nor in one already in nirvāṇa. One cannot be simultaneously in saṃsāra
and nirvāṇa. Nor is there any third option.

9\. "I, without grasping, will pass beyond sorrow,

And I will attain nirvāṇa," one says.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1832}
:::

Whoever grasps like this

Has a great grasping.

There is a stylistic feature in this verse that deserves note: The
pronoun "I" *(bdag)* is uncharacteristically fronted in the sentence and
is emphasized with the focus particle *(ni).* Nāgārjuna is hence drawing
attention to the fact that the individual in whose mouth this verse is
put is[]{#calibre_link-1833} grasping to his own identity as an agent
and as a continuing subject both through saṃsāra and into nirvāṇa. This
grasping onto self, he suggests, precludes the nirvāṇa the speaker
craves. But Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1834}rjuna presents another argument as
well: It is also possible to grasp after nirvāṇa---to reify it as a
state and to crave it as a phenomenon inherently different from saṃsāra
and as highly desirable since it is indeed characterized as liberation
from suffering. But this grasping onto the end of
grasping[]{#calibre_link-1835} is itself a grasping and so precludes the
attainment of nirvāṇa. nirvāṇa requires, according to Nāgārjuna, a
complete cessation of grasping, including that onto nirvāṇa itself.
While that might[]{#calibre_link-1836} seem paradoxical, it is not: To
grasp onto something in this sense requires, inter alia, that one reify
it. By refusing to reify liberation, in virtue of seeing it as the
corelative of bondage, which itself is not inherently existent, it
[]{#calibre_link-517}is possible to pursue the path to liberation
without creating at the same time a huge obstacle on that path---the
root delusion with regard to nirvā[]{#calibre_link-1837}ṇa itself.
Possible, that is, but perhaps not that
easy.[]{#calibre_link-700}[^84^](#calibre_link-200){.nounder},
[]{#calibre_link-701}[^85^](#calibre_link-201){.nounder}

10\. When you can't bring about nirvāṇa,

Nor the purification of cyclic existence,

What is cyclic existence,

And what is the nirvāṇa you examine?

Anyone who is subject to either of these pathologies---grasping to
one's[]{#calibre_link-1838} self or grasping for nirvāṇa---is incapable
of attaining that peace. So, Nāgārjuna urges, in order to make such
progress possible, one should reexamine one's conception of the nature
of phenomena in cyclic existence (both oneself and external phenomena)
and nirvā[]{#calibre_link-1839}ṇa itself. By coming to see their
ultimate emptiness, he suggests, one can relinquish that grasping and
attain that liberation.

Neither nirvāṇa nor samsara are inherently existent. Ultimately both are
nonexistent. So, what, Nāgārjuna asks rhetorically, are they? The
answer[]{#calibre_link-1840} is that they are conventionally real,
dependently arisen phenomena that are empty of inherent existence. In
virtue of that fact, it is possible to escape the former and to attain
the latter. But that escape would be impossible were they inherently
existent and is impossible for anyone who takes them to be so.

## **[]{#calibre_link-272 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-56 .calibre4}Chapter XVII  Examination of Actions and Their Fruits** {#chapter-xvii-examination-of-actions-and-their-fruits-1 .h1}

Arguing for the emptiness of bondage and liberation, however, raises a
further question that demands an answer: If there is no real bondage and
no real release, what are the effects of our actions? For it would
appear, at least given standard Buddhist moral theory and the doctrine
of karma on which it is
grounded,[]{#calibre_link-703}[^86^](#calibre_link-203){.nounder} that
meritorious actions[]{#calibre_link-1843} conduce to liberation and that
morally wrong actions increase bondage. Given the emptiness of these
latter, an analysis of the consequences of action is in order. Nāgārjuna
begins with Buddhist moral truisms, accepted by the Mādhyamika as well
as by members of other Buddhist schools. It is important to
note[]{#calibre_link-1844} that the first nineteen verses of this
chapter represent the views of four distinct opponents in order of
increasing similitude to the Mādhyamika understanding. Despite the fact
that Nāgārjuna sets these views up as targets, however, some of the
views the opponents put on the table are, suitably
interpreted,[]{#calibre_link-1845} shared by Nāgārjuna. Each

[]{#calibre_link-278}can be seen as, despite being inadmissible as a
characterization of a nonconventional basis for the relation between
action and its effects, a reasonable empirical assessment of at least
part of the conventional reality in this domain.

1\. Self-restraint and benefiting others

With a compassionate mind is the[]{#calibre_link-1846} Dharma.

This is the seed for

Fruits in this and future lives.

2\. The Unsurpassed Sage has said

That actions are either intention or intentional.

The varieties of these actions

Have been announced in many ways.

The classification to which Nāgārjuna refers is a partition of actions
into mental and physical. Mental actions are mere[]{#calibre_link-1847}
intentions on this view; physical actions and speech (generally
distinguished in Buddhist psychology and action theory) are properly
intentional. That is, the latter two involve a mental and a nonmental
component; the mental actions only involve a mental component. Verse 3
clarifies this:

3\. Of these, what is called "intention"

Is mental desire.

What is called "intentional"

Comprises the physical[]{#calibre_link-1848} and verbal.

In the next verse, an opponent uses these truisms as a platform for the
defense of the view that actions themselves must remain in existence
until their consequences are observed. Actions that derive from
renouncing the world are different from those that derive from worldly
concerns. This difference in nature, he argues, must explain the
difference in their consequences:

4\. Speech[]{#calibre_link-1849} and action and all

Kinds of unabandoned and abandoned actions

[]{#calibre_link-280}And
resolve[]{#calibre_link-705}[^87^](#calibre_link-204){.nounder}

As well as ...

5\. Virtuous and nonvirtuous actions

Derived from pleasure,

As well as intention and morality:

These seven[]{#calibre_link-706}[^88^](#calibre_link-205){.nounder}are
the kinds of action.

The kinds of actions to which Nāgārjuna's imaginary opponent refers are
simply the various kinds of virtuous[]{#calibre_link-1850} and
nonvirtuous actions. In general, morally good actions are done for the
sake of pleasure for others; morally bad actions sacrifice others' good
for one's own pleasure. The opponent, however, goes further, pointing
out that these actions have diverse long-term consequences that must be
explained:

6\. If until the time of ripening

Action had to remain in place, it would have to be permanent.

[]{#calibre_link-1851}If it has ceased, then having ceased,

How will a fruit arise?

The problem is this: Given that the consequence of an action may be far
in the future, something must persist to connect the action to the
result. This is a kind of karmic analog of doubts about action at a
distance. It is the same kind of move that lies behind trace theories of
memory in recent philosophy of mind. So this first
position[]{#calibre_link-1852} is that there must be some permanent
entity that remains in existence until the consequences of an action
occur.

A second possibility is that some third thing mediates the relation
between action and consequence---a kind of karmic link that is generated
by the action and remains in the psychophysical continuum
[]{#calibre_link-279}until the consequence is produced. The interlocutor
then offers an analogy popular in[]{#calibre_link-1853} Buddhist
philosophy:

7\. As for a continuum, such as the sprout,

It comes from a seed.

From that arises the fruit. Without a seed,

It would not come into being.

That is, just as every actual fruit requires an actual seed as its
predecessor and a sprout to mediate between them, the opponent reasons,
every consequence of action requires an actual action and an actual
karmic link between the[]{#calibre_link-1854} action and the
consequence. The next three verses extend this analogy:

8\. Since from the seed comes the continuum,

and from the continuum comes the fruit,

The seed precedes the fruit.

Therefore there is neither nonexistence nor permanence.

That is, this interlocutor points out, the position developed in XVII:
5--6 requires that actions either be permanent or nonexistent. His own
view, on the[]{#calibre_link-1855} other hand, allows actions to exist
as impermanent and is, hence, more plausible:

9\. So, in a mental continuum,

From a preceding intention

A consequent mental state arises.

Without this, it would not arise.

10\. Since from the intention comes the continuum,

And from the continuum the fruit arises,

Action precedes the fruit.

Therefore there is neither nonexistence nor permanence.

In the[]{#calibre_link-1856} next verse, another opponent offers an
orthodox formulation from a substantialist Buddhist school, arguing that
particular kinds of action are described as the methods of attaining
realization and that particular rewards for the practicioner are
mentioned []{#calibre_link-480}as consequences of realization. The
implication is that, since these are specified in *sūtras* as real, they
must be inherently[]{#calibre_link-1857} existent:

11\. The ten pure paths of action

Are the method of realizing the Dharma.

These fruits of the Dharma in this and other lives

Are the five pleasures.

"The ten paths" simply denotes the totality of virtuous actions as
characterized by one of the Buddhist botanies of morally worthy
action.[]{#calibre_link-708}[^89^](#calibre_link-206){.nounder}The five
pleasures are the pleasures appropriate to the various sense faculties.
According to[]{#calibre_link-1858} the opponent, all we need to do in
order to reach enlightenment and to lead good lives is to act
virtuously. The principal consequence of this is that we will enjoy
temporal happiness.

Yet another interlocutor replies that this wholly misunderstands the
Buddha's explanation of the relation between action and its
consequences. While it is the case that acting well is an important
ingredient in[]{#calibre_link-1859} Buddhist practice and in any account
of what it is to lead a good life, and while it is true that when one
lives well, one in general is rewarded with material happiness, this
hardly indicates that action, the agent, or the consequences of action
are inherently existent. Rather, this more sophisticated opponent
suggests, the nature of the link is completely abstract, like a legal
obligation:[]{#calibre_link-709}[^90^](#calibre_link-207){.nounder}

[]{#calibre_link-1860}12. If such an analysis were advanced,

There would be many great errors.

Therefore, this analysis

Is not tenable here.

[]{#calibre_link-281}13. I will then explain what is tenable here:

The analysis propounded by all

Buddhas, self-conquerors

And disciples according to which ...

14\. Action is like an uncancelled promissory note

And like a debt.

Of the realms it is fourfold.

Moreover, its nature is neutral.

[]{#calibre_link-1861}Using the metaphor of a promissory note, the
defender of this view compares action and its consequences to a document
attesting to a particular debt or other legal action: Though the act to
which the document attests was in one sense momentary, its consequences,
and the evidence of its reality, are unlimited in duration. So the
consequences of any action---however local that action might appear
to[]{#calibre_link-1862} be---reverberate through all realms of
existence. []{#calibre_link-711}[^91^](#calibre_link-208){.nounder}
Moreover, the fundamental nature of action and its consequences is
neutral. That is, simply considered as such, on this view, neither
action nor its consequent trace is either positive or negative. Any
particular action or trace may of course be so---but action itself is
equally capable of being positive or negative in character. We now turn
to[]{#calibre_link-1863} specific advice to enable one to realize the
nature of reality and to abandon the mundane concerns and attachments
that lead to binding actions (advice with which Nāgārjuna would not take
issue):

15\. By abandoning, that is not abandoned.

Abandonment occurs through meditation.

Therefore, through the nonexpired,

The fruit of action[]{#calibre_link-1864} arises.

Simply by resolving to abandon attachment one cannot thereby succeed in
shedding it. It is difficult to accomplish this. Attachment arises as a
consequence of the persistent, pervasive psychological, verbal, and
physical habits that together constitute what Buddhist philosophers call
the "root delusion," the ignorance of the true
[]{#calibre_link-437}nature of things. That delusion consists in
confusing existence[]{#calibre_link-1865} with inherent existence and
issues inevitably in one of the two extreme views---reification or
nihilism. Only through extensive meditation on the nature of phenomena
and on the nature of emptiness can these habits be abandoned, and only
through an understanding of the ultimate nature of things can the fruit
of actions done through abandonment---that is, liberation from the
suffering of cyclic[]{#calibre_link-1866} existence---be attained. The
promissory note metaphor is at work here as well. The idea is that one
cannot simply cancel a promissory note on one's own without paying the
debt. One must do something more substantial to discharge one's
obligation to one's creditor.

16\. If abandonment occurred through abandoning, and

If action were destroyed through transformation,

The destruction of action, etc.,

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1867}
:::

And other errors would arise.

If one thought that one could just resolve to abandon attachment and
delusion and succeed, that would be to treat attachment and attached
action as trivial entities---even as illusory in the full sense. Just as
when one sees a mirage, one can, knowing that it is a mirage, stop
seeing it as water. That is possible for illusory things, but not so for
empirically real[]{#calibre_link-1868} ones. It takes effort to see an
actual puddle as empty---not of conventional water, but of
nonconventional inherent existence---and it takes effort to stop
reifying habits. Again, though this is articulated in defense of the
opponent's view, this is a sophisticated opponent, and Nāgārjuna in fact
agrees with much of this.

17\. From all these[]{#calibre_link-1869} actions in a realm,

Whether similar or dissimilar,

At the moment of birth

Only one will arise.

One performs countless various actions in one's life. And the confluence
of the karmic consequences of all of them, on this view, are realized in
the beginning of a single individual at the moment
[]{#calibre_link-1870}of rebirth (the one who arises). This comment is,
of course, most directly about rebirth and the
mechanism[]{#calibre_link-1871} of karma in transmigration. Here is a
way to understand that explicit point: The mechanism by which karma
operates in rebirth is not that each individual action in a continuum
designated as an individual remains permanently in place or leaves a
substantial trace that lies dormant until it produces its consequence.
This is indeed how karma is often conceived by substantialist Buddhist
schools.[]{#calibre_link-1872} Rather, each moment of such a continuum,
including the moment of rebirth, is a consequence, through the mechanism
of dependent arising, of all of the previous moments of that continuum
(and, of course, of much else besides). Those karmic consequences are,
as it were, "summed up" in the total state of the individual at birth.

But of course the implications of this are more general and
concern[]{#calibre_link-1873} every moment of any life. They can hence
be made independently of any discussion of transmigration, though of
course they help to demystify that Buddhist doctrine, at least as it is
conceived in Mahāyāna philosophy. The point is this: Every moment of our
lives represents the causal consequences of, inter alia, all of our
prior actions.[]{#calibre_link-1874} No action "lies dormant" waiting
for its consequences to emerge. Nor does any action somehow become
"canceled" when some salient consequence is noticed. There is no
accounting kept, and no debit and credit system, either from the causal
or the moral point of view in the continuum of human action and
experience. Rather, at each moment we are the total consequence of what
we have done and of what[]{#calibre_link-1875} we have experienced. And
the only sense in which some past action may determine some future
reward is one in which that past action, as well as other conditions,
have determined a state now that, together with other future conditions,
will determine that reward. Mutatis mutandis, of course, for negative
consequences. This sober empiricist account of these matters forms the
basis for Mahā[]{#calibre_link-1876}yāna moral theory and its account of
the nature of soteriological practice.

18\. In this visible world,

All actions of the two kinds,

Each comprising action and the unexpired separately,

Will remain while ripening.

[]{#calibre_link-282}But here the opponent slides over into the
substantialism that Nāgārjuna will criticize.[]{#calibre_link-1877} For
although he has characterized actions as impermanent, he has retained
the seed-and-sprout metaphor that has the actions identifiable over time
and, hence, as having an independent existence and identity. Moreover,
he suggests, their consequences are determinate in time, delimited by
death or nirvāṇa:

19\. That fruit, if extinction or death

[]{#calibre_link-1878}Occurs, ceases.

Regarding this, a distinction between the stainless

And the stained is drawn.

Nāgārjuna now mounts a reply against all of these positions
collectively:

20\. Emptiness and nonannihilation;

Cyclic existence and nonpermanence:

That action is nonexpiring

Is taught by the Buddha.

All phenomena, including action, its result,[]{#calibre_link-1879} and
the connection between them, will come out to be empty of inherent
existence, yet conventionally real; they will be part of cyclic
existence, but will be impermanent. This is not surprising. But
Nāgārjuna also says that no action expires (retaining the promissory
note metaphor). Obviously, he cannot mean that actions are
permanent.[]{#calibre_link-1880} Rather, we should understand this to
assert two related theses: First, it indicates that the consequences of
actions do not cease at some point. All actions have ramifications into
the indefinite future, due to dependent arising. Second, actions
themselves, being empty of inherent existence are not entities capable
of passing out of existence, when passing out of existence is
interpreted to mean[]{#calibre_link-1881} the cessation entirely of
something that once existed inherently. Since actions are not inherently
existent, they are not suitable bases for inherent cessation. And this
resolves the final apparent paradox: The tension between the assertion
that nothing is permanent and that all action is nonexpiring. All
phenomena are indeed impermanent, []{#calibre_link-488}but that entails
both that they do not inherently cease[]{#calibre_link-1882} and that
their effects are indefinite in scope.

21\. Because action does not arise,

It is seen to be without essence.

Because it is not arisen,

It follows that it is nonexpiring.

This verse emphasizes the second reading of the thesis of the
nonexpiration of action and echoes the arguments from Chapter VII.

22\. If action had an essence,

It would, without doubt, be eternal.

Action would be[]{#calibre_link-1883} uncreated.

Because there can be no creation of what is eternal.

Moreover, Nāgārjuna reminds us, again drawing heavily on the arguments
reviewed and redeployed in Chapter VII, things with essences don't arise
and cease, and can't be related causally to other things. If action
existed inherently, it couldn't be initiated. So, if one
were[]{#calibre_link-1884} trying to preserve the reality of action and
karma against the analysis in terms of emptiness (because one viewed
that analysis as undermining their genuine existence), it would be
pointless to defend the existence of action and karma as inherent
existence.

23\. If an action were uncreated,

Fear would arise of encountering something not done.

And the error of not preserving

One's vows would[]{#calibre_link-1885} arise.

Nāgārjuna here and in XVII: 24 draws some of the moral consequences of
the nihilistic view of action that seems to follow from the conditions
set on its existence by the reificationist: Actions would not come into
being through agency and so would have no regular relation to any
agents. And so one might find oneself experiencing[]{#calibre_link-1886}
the consequences of some action one had not performed, or find that it
was, in some sense, one's own action. One would not take action
seriously as one's own responsibility and would not worry
[]{#calibre_link-528}about moral infractions. Monks and nuns would break
their vows. Since morality depends on a distinction between morally
positive and morally negative acts, if there were no actions, or if
actions could not[]{#calibre_link-1887} be thought of as initiated by
their agents, there would be no morality. From another perspective, the
preservation of vows would be an impossibility anyway since preserving
the vows requires taking action, which would be impossible if action
were uncreated.

24\. All conventions would then

Be contradicted, without doubt.

It would be impossible to draw a distinction

Between virtue and evil.

[]{#calibre_link-1888}Moreover, Nāgārjuna argues in the next verse, if
actions had essences, they could not cease, and if their karmic
consequences had essences since they would need no conditions to arise,
they would just keep arising:

25\. Whatever is mature would mature

Time and time again.

If there were essence, this would follow,

Because action would[]{#calibre_link-1889} remain in place.

26\. While this action has affliction as its nature

This affliction is not real in itself.

If affliction is not in itself,

How can action be real in itself?

Moreover, Nāgārjuna continues, afflicted action is, for the opponent,
done essentially in affliction. But given that affliction has already
been shown to be empty[]{#calibre_link-1890} in the chapter on suffering
(XII), how could it serve as an essence for action?

27\. Action and affliction

Are taught to be the conditions that produce bodies.

If action and affliction

Are empty, what would one say about bodies?

The opponent replies, however, that action and affliction are referred
to in *sūtras* as the causes of different kinds of rebirth and
[]{#calibre_link-1891}of different[]{#calibre_link-1892} characteristics
in rebirths. And since beings are indeed reborn and do indeed have
characteristics, how, from the standpoint of a Buddhist view of rebirth,
could empty actions and empty karmic consequences explain this?

28\. Obstructed by ignorance,

And consumed by passion, the experiencer

Is neither different from the agent

Nor identical with it.

Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1893}rjuna focuses in his reply on the nature of
the individual who is the putative agent of these actions and
experiencer of their consequences. The present objection rests on the
presupposition that they exist inherently. That is why the problem
arises about how empty actions and empty karmic links could be
sufficient to link their properties. So Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1894}rjuna
emphasizes that neither an analysis in terms of inherent identity nor
one in terms of inherent difference between agent and action will
suffice. Both presupposes, incoherently, the inherent existence and
hence the possession of an essence, of each term in the putative
relation. But this of course recalls the problem posed near the end of
Chapter I: How can actual effects arise from empty[]{#calibre_link-1895}
conditions? And Nāgārjuna's reply echoes the reply developed there:

29\. Since this action

Is not arisen from a condition,

Nor arisen causelessly,

It follows that there is no agent.

Since the action does not arise inherently, it lacks inherent existence.
Since, as per the discussion of agent and action in Chapter VIII, empty
actions[]{#calibre_link-1896} entail empty agents, there is no
inherently existing agent of the kind presupposed by the objector. But
the objector continues:

30\. If there is no action and agent,

Where could the fruit of action be?

Without a fruit,

Where is there an experiencer?

[]{#calibre_link-381}That is, if we deny the reality of the action and
the agent, we seem to deny the reality of the consequences of the action
and, hence, the experiencer,[]{#calibre_link-1897} whether "without
understanding and consumed by passion" or not. But Nāgārjuna's view is
not that these things are non-existent, as he emphasized in XVII:
20---only that they are empty. So it does follow that the consequences
are *empty*---but that does not entail in any way that they are
nonexistent. And it follows that the consequence
and[]{#calibre_link-1898} the karmic link are empty. From this it
follows that the reborn individual whose existence and characteristics
are determined by this causal sequence is also empty of inherent
existence. And if so, there is no problem about how his/her genesis is
dependent upon an empty sequence. Nāgārjuna introduces an analogy to
explain this situation:

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1899}
:::

31\. Just as the teacher, by magic,

Makes a magical illusion, and

By that illusion

Another illusion is created,

32\. In that way are an agent and his action:

The agent is like the illusion.

The action

Is like the illusion's illusion.

That is, we can understand the entire sequence of agent, action,
consequences of action, and arising of new agent, whether within a
single lifetime or---in the[]{#calibre_link-1900} context of Buddhist
ontology and doctrine---across lifetimes, as an entirely empty sequence
with entirely empty stages. But that does not prevent its being
perceived, or its reality for those who participate therein.

33\. Afflictions, actions, bodies,

Agents, and fruits are

Like a city of Gandharvas and

Like a mirage or a dream.

Again, it is important to emphasize that emptiness, rather
than[]{#calibre_link-1901} being a kind of non actuality contrasting
with empirical reality, is in fact the very condition of empirical
reality and hence the only kind []{#calibre_link-1902}of genuine
actuality. Mirages and dreams are actual phenomena, which actually
appear and which have consequences. But that does not mean that they
appear to us in a nondeceptive way. Mirages are not water and do not
quench thirst, and dream-elephants carry[]{#calibre_link-1903} no loads.
By analogy, saṃsāra, action, karmic link, and consequence, Nāgārjuna
argues, are real empirical phenomena, but are empty of anything more
than conventional existence. While they may appear to exist inherently,
either as persistent phenomena, as processes or elements of
processes,[]{#calibre_link-1904} or as abstract phenomena---as per the
various opposing views considered in this chapter---they do not so
exist. For to exist in those ways would in fact be incoherent. This
analysis hence does not entail the nonexistence of agent and action,
except from the ultimate point of view. Rather it explains how it is
possible for them to exist at all.

## **[]{#calibre_link-287 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-57 .calibre4}Chapter XVIII  Examination of Self and Entities** {#chapter-xviii-examination-of-self-and-entities-1 .h1}

A good deal of the confusion Nāgārjuna diagnoses in the previous two
chapters concerns the presupposition that the self, as an afflicted
being capable of liberation from suffering, must be thought of as an
inherently real entity. In this chapter, therefore,
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1907}gārjuna turns to an examination of the self, per
se, apart from its relation to such things as perception, action,
suffering, affliction, and so forth, as he has examined it in prior
chapters.

1\. If the self were the aggregates,

It would have arising and ceasing (as properties).

If it were different from the aggregates,

It would not have the characteristics of[]{#calibre_link-1908} the
aggregates.

If there is an inherently existent self, it must either be identical to
or different from the aggregates. The aggregates are the more basic
components into which the individual divides upon analysis. In standard
Buddhist analysis, they include the physical body, sensation,
perception, dispositions, and consciousness or cognition. It is
important to note, though, that this particular[]{#calibre_link-1909}
analysis has no deep philosophical significance. It reflects an
essentially empirical psychological theory about the best explanatory
framework to use in comprehending human behavior and the most useful way
for a Buddhist practitioner to attend to his/her experience.
[]{#calibre_link-461}As we have seen already, the aggregates are
themselves empty, and as much Buddhist psychology emphasizes, they, too,
are subject[]{#calibre_link-1910} to further decomposition. But
Nāgārjuna's argument proceeds independently of any particular
decomposition. No matter how one analyzes the human being, if we are to
posit over and above the components into which it divides an inherently
existent self, that self must be either identical to or different from
those components. (This argument,[]{#calibre_link-1911} by the way,
appears in virtually the same form in *On Man* by Sextus Empiricus.)

But if the self is identical to the aggregates, it will be constantly
changing, constantly arising and ceasing, since the aggregates are
constantly arising and ceasing. This is so whether one takes the self to
be identical to some one of the aggregates or to the whole collection of
the aggregates. If, on the other[]{#calibre_link-1912} hand, one takes
the self to be distinct from the aggregates, the relation between them
becomes completely mysterious; the self becomes unknowable, and the fate
of the aggregates becomes irrelevant to the fate of the self. This is
because the only objects ever given to us in introspection are the
aggregates (a familiar Humean insight), and the self we presumably care
about is one we *know.* And it[]{#calibre_link-1913} would be a bit
bizarre to suggest that whatever happens to my mind, body, memory,
sensory experience, and so forth, is independent of what happens to
*me.*

One must, of course, keep in mind that this destructive dilemma depends
upon the attempt to identify a single inherently existent self and does
not undermine the possibility of a conventionally identified self
posited on the basis of the aggregates.[]{#calibre_link-1914} So what
Nāgārjuna is emphatically *not* doing is arguing that there are no
aggregates in any sense or that there are no persons, agents, subjects,
and so forth. The hypothesis for reductio is that over and above (or
below and beneath) any composite of phenomena collectively denoted by
"I" or by a proper name, there is a single
substantial[]{#calibre_link-1915} entity that is the referent of such a
term.

But, the proponent of the inherently existent self asks, what is the
bearer of the self's properties and the thing that possesses those
aggregates? The first half of XVIII: 2 raises this question. The second
half begins Nāgārjuna's reply, which occupies the remainder of the
chapter and constitutes[]{#calibre_link-1916} a substantial portion of
his []{#calibre_link-462}positive view on the nature of self from the
standpoint of ontology and soteriology:

2\. If there were no self,

Where would the self's (properties) be?

From the pacification of the self and what belongs to it,

One abstains from grasping onto "I" and "mine."

Nāgārjuna replies that once one stops trying[]{#calibre_link-1917} to
posit an independent self, the problem posed simply vanishes. That is,
the worry about the possessor of the aggregates and properties of the
self occurs only given that one conceives of them as properties and
aggregates that are essentially *of* something. The insight is a bit
abstract, but it is the same one that Hume was after in the Fig argument
in the *Treatise.*
[]{#calibre_link-713}[^92^](#calibre_link-210){.nounder}Much of the
motivation for[]{#calibre_link-1918} positing a substantial self is the
intuition that since its properties and components exist, they must
exist *somewhere*---that there must be a substratum in which they
inhere. But once we give up that conception of what it is for a property
or a component to exist (as Nāgārjuna has argued that we must in
Chapters V, VI, and IX above), the[]{#calibre_link-1919} drive to posit
a substratum vanishes. And when the drive to posit the substratum
vanishes, we simply, Nāgārjuna urges, think of the aggregates and
properties as associated aggregates and properties, not as *my*
aggregates and properties.

3\. One who does not grasp onto "I" and "mine,"

That one does not exist.

One who does not grasp onto[]{#calibre_link-1920} "I" and "mine,"

He does not perceive.

These are corelative. When one stops grasping the aggregates and the
self as independent entities or as the possessions of independent
entities, one recognizes one's own lack of inherent existence. One also
recognizes the lack of inherent existence of the aggregates, as in the
case of perception. This is not to say that one ceases conventionally to
exist[]{#calibre_link-1921} or that one goes blind---rather it is
[]{#calibre_link-393}that one comes to understand one's own existence
and that of other entities in the context of emptiness and, hence, to
regard that existence as necessarily relational and conventional.

The relation between the second and third verses of this chapter is also
important from the standpoint of the relation between theory and
practice, philosophy and soteriology:[]{#calibre_link-1922} Nāgārjuna
emphasizes the two-way streets in this neighborhood. Understanding
emptiness leads one to grasp less, to become more detached. Relaxing
one's tendency to grasp leads to a realization of emptiness. Philosophy,
meditation, and the practice of the moral virtues that issue in the
relaxation of grasping are conceived from this
vantage[]{#calibre_link-1923} point as necessarily mutually supportive.

4\. When views of "I" and "mine" are extinguished,

Whether with respect to the internal or external,

The appropriator ceases.

This having ceased, birth ceases.

When one completely relinquishes the view of entities and the self as
inherently existent and when all habits of reification have been
eliminated, Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1924}rjuna urges, liberation from
cyclic existence and suffering have been achieved. Nāgārjuna defers the
precise characterization of nirvāna to the chapter devoted to its
examination and that devoted to the examination of the status of the
Tathāgata (XXV and XXII, respectively).

[]{#calibre_link-1925}5. Action and misery having ceased, there is
nirvāṇa.

Action and misery come from conceptual thought.

This comes from mental fabrication.

Fabrication ceases through emptiness.

The diagnosis, though, of the predicament of samsāra and the
corresponding prescription are clear: Grasping, contaminated action, and
suffering[]{#calibre_link-1926} are rooted in delusion, and this
delusion comes from cognitive error. The root delusion---the fundamental
cognitive error---is the confusion of merely conventional existence with
inherent existence. The realization of emptiness eliminates that
fabrication of essence, which eliminates grasping, contaminated action,
and its pernicious consequences.

[]{#calibre_link-339}6. That there is a self has been taught,

And the[]{#calibre_link-1927} doctrine of no-self,

By the buddhas, as well as the

Doctrine of neither self nor nonself.

There are many discussions of the way to think about the self in the
Buddhist canon. For those who are nihilistic about the self (such as
contemporary eliminative materialists or classical Indian Cārvākas), it
is important to explain the conventional[]{#calibre_link-1928} reality
of the self. For those who tend to reify the self, the doctrine of
no-self is taught, that is, the doctrine of the emptiness of the self.
But, Nāgārjuna claims, as a preamble to the next verse, there is a
deeper view of the matter---a doctrine of neither self nor nonself.

That doctrine is closely tied to that of the emptiness
of[]{#calibre_link-1929} emptiness. Both the terms "self" and "no-self"
together with any conceptions that can be associated with them,
Nāgārjuna claims, are conventional designations. They may each be
soteriologically and analytically useful antidotes to extreme
metaphysical views and to the disturbances those views occasion. But to
neither corresponds an entity---neither[]{#calibre_link-1930} a thing
that we could ever find on analysis and identify with the self, nor a
thing or state that we could identify with no-self. The terms and the
properties they designate are themselves empty, despite the fact that
they are used to designate emptiness. To say neither self nor no-self
is, from this perspective, not to shrug one's shoulders in indecision
but to recognize that while each[]{#calibre_link-1931} of these is a
useful characterization of the situation for some purposes, neither can
be understood as correctly ascribing a property to an independently
existent entity. And if they cannot be understood in this way, what are
we really saying?

7\. What language expresses is nonexistent.

The sphere of thought is nonexistent.

Unarisen and unceased, like nirvāṇ[]{#calibre_link-1932}a

Is the nature of things.

This insight is developed further in this verse. Here Nāgārjuna begins
to move towards his famous and surprising identification of nirvāṇa with
saṃsāra, and of emptiness with conventional reality. This
[]{#calibre_link-467}identification[]{#calibre_link-1933} of what in
earlier Buddhism were regarded as wholly different from one another and
this characterization of the mundane in terms heretofore reserved for
the putatively transcendent are among Nāgārjuna's most radical and
original moves and are central to the development of a distinctively
Māhā[]{#calibre_link-1934}yana outlook. In the first two lines, he
reiterates that there are no actual conventionindependent entities that
correspond to the ostensible referring terms or predicates in our
language. But, he argues, from the emptiness of things, it follows that
they never either arise or cease. This does not mean that they are
permanent, of course. Rather it means that while arising and ceasing and
consequent[]{#calibre_link-1935} impermanence are features of all
conventional phenomena and are among the features that make them empty,
from the ultimate point of view, as was argued in Chapter VII, there is
no ultimate basis for arising and ceasing. But if nirvāṇa is liberation
from cyclic existence and hence from arising and ceasing, it follows
that, from the ultimate standpoint,[]{#calibre_link-1936} all things in
saṃsāra are actually just as they are in nirvāṇa.

8\. Everything is real and is not real,

Both real and not real.

Neither real nor not real.

This is Lord Buddha's teaching.

This is the positive tetralemma regarding existence. Everything is
conventionally real. Everything is ultimately[]{#calibre_link-1937}
unreal (that is, not unreal in just any sense, but unreal when seen from
the ultimate standpoint). Everything has both characteristics---that is,
everything is both conventionally real and ultimately unreal. Nothing is
ultimately real or completely nonexistent. That is, everything is
neither real in one sense nor not-real in another
sense.[]{#calibre_link-715}[^93,^](#calibre_link-211){.nounder}[]{#calibre_link-716}[^94^](#calibre_link-212){.nounder}

[]{#calibre_link-487}Interestingly, the tetralemma can also be
asserted[]{#calibre_link-1938} in a negative form with some of the same
force: Nothing is real (ultimately). Nothing is not-real (everything has
a kind of reality). Nothing is both real and not-real (in the same
sense---that would be contradictory). Nothing is neither real nor
not-real (the law of the excluded middle). Both forms of the tetralemma
are found in this text. See XXII:
11.[]{#calibre_link-718}[^95,^](#calibre_link-213){.nounder}[]{#calibre_link-719}[^96^](#calibre_link-214){.nounder}

9\. Not dependent on another, peaceful[]{#calibre_link-1939} and

Not fabricated by mental fabrication,

Not thought, without distinctions,

That is the character of *reality* (that-ness).

That is, independent of conceptual imputation there are no objects, no
identities, and so, no distinctions. But of course, as Kant would agree,
there is no way that we can think such a reality.

[]{#calibre_link-382}Nonetheless, Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1940}rjuna argues
(and Kant still agrees), we must see that that is the ultimate truth
about things, though it might in its nature be inexpressible and
inconceivable.[]{#calibre_link-721}[^97^](#calibre_link-215){.nounder}

10\. Whatever comes into being dependent on another

Is not identical to that thing.

Nor is it different from it.

Therefore it is neither nonexistent in time nor permanent.

Here Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1941}rjuna recapitulates a brief analysis of
what it is for a phenomenon to be dependently arisen. But in the context
of the deeper understanding of emptiness and of the relation between the
ultimate and the conventional developed in this chapter, a deeper
reading of this verse is in order: Our attention is called to the fact
that the analysis of dependency developed here---and consequently of the
conventional[]{#calibre_link-1942} reality and ultimate nonexistence of
the dependent---is at the same time a correct conventional
characterization of the nature of phenomena and an ostention of the fact
[]{#calibre_link-481}that it is only a conventional designation of a
nature that must remain
uncharacterizable.[]{#calibre_link-723}[^98^](#calibre_link-216){.nounder}

11\. By the buddhas, patrons of the world,

This immortal truth is taught:

Without identity, without distinction;

Not non-existent in[]{#calibre_link-1943} time, not permanent.

That is, this doctrine itself is also empty. It is conventionally real,
ultimately nonexistent, dependent, impermanent, and has a nature in
itself that can never be characterized. The final verse is an
admonishment to meditate seriously on this argument. For by
understanding clearly the nature of the self and of the entities to
which it is related, Nā[]{#calibre_link-1944}gārjuna believes that one
can attain buddhahood. That is why he emphasizes that with a correct
view, even without a teacher or a buddha to instruct one, a patient
meditator can attain his/her own awakening.

12\. When the fully enlightened ones do not appear,

And when the disciples have disappeared,

The wisdom of the self-enlightened ones

Will arise completely without[]{#calibre_link-1945} a teacher.

## **[]{#calibre_link-492 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-58 .calibre4}Chapter XIX  Examination of Time** {#chapter-xix-examination-of-time-1 .h1}

Another response to the attack on the reality of action and its
consequences might to be argue that, nonetheless, the time in which
action and its consequences are realized must be real. Nāgārjuna in this
chapter argues that time cannot be conceived of as an entity existing
independently of temporal phenomena,[]{#calibre_link-1948} but must
itself be regarded as a set of relations among them. His arguments are
closely akin to those of Zeno, Sextus, and McTaggart.

1\. If the present and the future

Depend on the past,

Then the present and the future

Would have existed in the past.

Nāgārjuna's method is to divide time into the past, the present, and the
future[]{#calibre_link-1949} and then to argue that none of these can be
said to inherently exist. In these first two verses, he considers one
horn of an implicit dilemma: The present and the future either depend
upon the past or they do not. In these two verses he considers the
possibility that they do depend upon the past. But if they depend upon
it in any sense that could plausibly guarantee their inherent existence,
they[]{#calibre_link-1950} must somehow emerge from it as a basis. If
so, he argues, they must have existed in the past. For if they did not,
then we would have the situation where when the time on which they
[]{#calibre_link-1951}ostensibly depend exists they do not exist, or a
situation where at the time they exist that on which they ostensibly
depend does not exist. We would then either have the situation in which
the ostensibly dependent[]{#calibre_link-1952} exists, but in the
absence of that on which it depends, or in which the necessary condition
exists, but without that of which it is the condition.

This raises two difficulties, one general and one specific to the case
at hand: First, by the arguments developed concerning the temporal
relations between causes and their effects in Chapters I and VII, we
have two incoherent situations from the standpoint[]{#calibre_link-1953}
of anyone who considers the causal relation or its relata to be
inherently existent. There must be a real relation between the cause and
the effect in which the effect is contained potentially in the cause,
and this would unfortunately entail the past existence of the present
and the future. But second, there is a little regress to be developed.
For if the present and the future depend upon[]{#calibre_link-1954} the
past, they must succeed or be simultaneous with it. But they must
succeed or be simultaneous with it in time. That requires a super-time
in which the parts of time are related, and so on, ad infinitum.

2\. If the present and the future

Did not exist there,

How could the present and the future

Be dependent upon it?

That is, if we deny that the present and the future existed
potentially[]{#calibre_link-1955} in the past and were somehow
coexistent with it, there is no way to understand the mechanics of the
dependency relation. By the time the present comes around, the past
isn't around to give rise to it. And when the past was around, the
present didn't occur.

3\. If they are not dependent upon the past,

Neither of the two would be established.

Therefore neither the present

Nor the future would[]{#calibre_link-1956} exist.

If, on the other hand, one argued that the parts of time are
independent, there would be no sense in which they would be
[]{#calibre_link-1957}determinately ordered and in which they would be
part of the same time. Time is by definition an ordering of events in
which moments stand in determinate relations to one another, in virtue
of which the location of any moment depends on the location of all of
the others.[]{#calibre_link-1958} The present is the present only
because it is poised within the past and the future. If it were not, it
would not be the present. So either the present is in the past, in which
case it is nonexistent, or it is independent of the past and the future,
in which case it is nonexistent.

4\. By the same method,

The other two divisions---past and future,

Upper, lower, middle, etc.,

Unity, etc., should[]{#calibre_link-1959} be understood.

That is, we can generalize this argument about the dependency of the
future and present, whose narrow purpose is to demonstrate the
nonexistence of the present, to demonstrate the nonexistence of the past
and future as inherently existent entities. Moreover, Nāgārjuna notes,
this argument applies, mutatis mutandis, to[]{#calibre_link-1960}
spatial relations.

5\. A nonstatic time is not grasped.

Nothing one could grasp as

Stationary time exists.

If time is not grasped, how is it known?

This is a second destructive dilemma: Time, if it exists as an entity,
is either stationary or changing. To say that it is changing is
incoherent; we would need to posit a super-time in which that change
occurs. But to say that it is static is[]{#calibre_link-1961} incoherent
as well. That suggests that past, present, and future coexist. So there
is no coherent conception of time as an entity.

6\. If time depends on an entity,

Then without an entity how could time exist?

There is no existent entity.

So how can time exist?

[]{#calibre_link-407}Finally, Nāgārjuna argues, we cannot suppose that
time exists as one entity[]{#calibre_link-1962} dependent on some other
as its ground if we want time to exist inherently. This is because, in
the previous arguments in the text, we have already argued that none of
the entities that exist in time are inherently existent. So none would
form a suitable ontological basis for an inherently existent time.

But this final verse is double-edged, and its positive reading contains
Nā[]{#calibre_link-1963}gārjuna's positive account of the nature of
time. Nāgārjuna points out that with no entities to be temporally
related, there is no time. That is, the only mode of existence that time
has is as a set of relations among empirical phenomena. Apart from those
phenomena and those relations, there is no
time.[]{#calibre_link-725}[^99^](#calibre_link-218){.nounder}[]{#calibre_link-1964}
But that means that, given the lack of inherent existence of phenomena,
there can be no inherent existence of time. Time is thus merely a
dependent set of relations, not an entity in its own right, and
certainly not the inherently existent vessel of existence it might
appear to be.

## **[]{#calibre_link-358 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-59 .calibre4}Chapter XX  Examination of Combination** {#chapter-xx-examination-of-combination-1 .h1}

This chapter examines the possibility that, while no effect could be
inherently dependent upon any single cause, it might be that the correct
understanding of dependent arising and the thoroughgoing interdependence
of phenomena that Nāgārjuna urges involves the inherent dependence of
any phenomenon[]{#calibre_link-1967} on the combination of all of its
conditions. Thus, while every phenomenon would, as Nāgārjuna has been
arguing, be completely dependent on all others, this dependence itself
would be inherently existent. Much of the argument is a reprise of
arguments that we have seen already, particularly in Chapters I and VII.
But the temporal analysis[]{#calibre_link-1968} of Chapter XIX is also
in evidence.

1\. If, arising from the combination of

Causes and conditions,

The effect is in the combination,

How could it arise from the combination?

2\. If, arising from the combination of

Causes and conditions,

The effect is not in the combination,

How could it arise from the combination?

In the opening verses, Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1969}rjuna sets up the
destructive dilemma that frames the first part of this chapter: Either
the effect is []{#calibre_link-436}already present in the combination on
which it is supposed by the reificationist to inherently depend or it is
not. If it is, he will argue, there is no sense in which it really
arises from them at all. If not, on the other hand, he will argue that
there is no sense in which whatever dependence[]{#calibre_link-1970}
there is could be inherent dependence. Nāgārjuna alternates in the
subsequent verses between these alternatives, developing a number of
difficulties for each.

3\. If the effect is in the combination

Of causes and conditions,

Then it should be grasped in the combination.

But it is not grasped in the combination.

First, suppose that[]{#calibre_link-1971} the effect already exists
somehow in the combination of phenomena on which it depends. Then in
grasping---that is, in conceiving or perceiving---that collection, we
should, ipso facto, grasp the effect. But we do not. Consider the set of
conditions of a match lighting. There is the presence of sulphur,
friction, oxygen, and so forth. But neither in virtue of conceiving of
these things nor in virtue of[]{#calibre_link-1972} seeing them do we
see fire.

4\. If the effect is not in the combination

Of causes and conditions,

Then actual causes and conditions

Would be like noncauses and nonconditions.

On the other hand, Nāgārjuna argues, if the proponent of inherently
existent dependence argues that the effect is not present in the
combination, he would have[]{#calibre_link-1973} to say that there is no
difference between actual conditions of an effect and an arbitrary
collection of phenomena with no relation at all to it. Because the very
point of this analysis is to explain how a particular set of conditions
determines an effect. For Nāgārjuna, as we should be able to see by
recalling his treatment of dependent[]{#calibre_link-1974} origination
and the relation between conditions and their effects in Chapter I, this
is no problem: There is simply no general metaphysical answer to such a
question for a Mādhyamika philosopher. A collection of conditions
determines its effect simply because when those conditions are
[]{#calibre_link-360}present, that effect arises. That fact may in turn
be empirically explicable by[]{#calibre_link-1975} other regularities.
But there is no independent foundation for the network of regularities
itself. However, for the substantialist there must be some analysis of
the collection of conditions itself that answers the question regarding
*how* that collection has the power to produce that effect. And the
answer the opponent proposes is that it does so because the effect is
inherently present in some[]{#calibre_link-1976} sense in that
collection.

5\. If the cause, in having its effect,

Ceased to have its causal status,

There would be two kinds of cause:

With and without causal status.

At this point, Nāgārjuna turns to the temporal relation between the
effect, the cause, and the combination of conditions that together with
the primary cause of the[]{#calibre_link-1977} effect bring about the
effect. The position that he is worrying about is this: Effects depend
upon particular causes, but those causes need the cooperation of
supporting conditions in order to be efficacious. The familiar example
in this context is that of the seed and the sprout. The seed, according
to the proponent of such a position, causes the sprout, but only if
there is soil, water, air, and[]{#calibre_link-1978} so forth, to
support it. Nāgārjuna then complains that on this view the word "cause"
is being used equivocally: In one sense it is used to refer to
things---the primary causes---that really don't cause anything. In the
other sense, it is used to refer to those that really have causal
status---namely, the entire assemblage of conditions
that[]{#calibre_link-1979} are necessary and sufficient for the arising
of the effect.

6\. If the cause, not yet having

Produced its effect, ceased,

Then having arisen from a ceased cause,

The effect would be without a cause.

But, he urges, if we want to assert that the cause, instead of changing
from a cause to a noncause, simply ceases at the moment when it produces
its effect, we still have a problem. Because by[]{#calibre_link-1980}
the []{#calibre_link-1981}time the effect emerges, the cause will have
vanished, and the effect will then have emerged without a cause and so
will be a causeless effect.

7\. If the effect were to arise

Simultaneously with the collection,

Then the produced and the producer

Would arise simultaneously.

Turning now to the entire collection as determinative of the effect,
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-1982}rjuna points out that the effect cannot be
simultaneous with the occurrence of a collection of its conditions for
all of the reasons that he has advanced previously against the
simultaneity of causes and their effects.

8\. If the effect were to arise

Prior to the combination,

Then, without causes and conditions,

The effect would arise causelessly.

But neither, of course, can the effect arise[]{#calibre_link-1983}
before the conditions are met since the effect would then arise
spontaneously, and this possibility has been refuted earlier.

9\. If, the cause having ceased, the effect

Were a complete transformation of the cause,

Then a previously arisen cause

Would arise again.

Nāgārjuna now responds to the following possible reply: The
effect[]{#calibre_link-1984} in question is not an entity distinct from
the cause or the collection of conditions that serve as its ground.
Therefore these questions about the temporal relations between events
involving distinct entities do not arise. The sprout is not distinct
from the seed, but is merely a complete transformation of it. But,
Nāgārjuna argues, it[]{#calibre_link-1985} is also not possible to
characterize the effect as a simple change of nature of a single entity
that was the cause before the transformation. For then we would have to
say that the cause []{#calibre_link-344}remains in existence after the
effect arises and so would have to keep producing the same effect over
and over again.

This argument might seem not to have much bite. After all, one might
think, the alternative[]{#calibre_link-1986} being proposed seems quite
like Nāgārjuna's own view that we should not think of causes and their
effects as distinct entities. But this would be wrong. This argument
succeeds because the opponent denies the distinctness in entity between
cause and effect by positing an identity in essence and by appealing to
that essence to explain the[]{#calibre_link-1987} causal potential of
the cause. If the essence of the entity is what determines its causal
potential, then if that essence remains, the potential should remain as
well. If the essence does not remain, then the language of
transformation must be abandoned. If the essence remains, and the
language of transformation is retained at an accidental level, the claim
that there is an essential causal principle[]{#calibre_link-1988} must
be rejected.

10\. How can a cause, having ceased and dissolved,

Give rise to a produced effect?

How can a cause joined with its effect produce it

If they persist together?

Nāgārjuna now returns to the temporal trilemma. As he has argued before,
just as a cause cannot follow or be simultaneous with its effect, the
precedence of[]{#calibre_link-1989} cause over effect is problematic as
well. For when there is a cause, there is no effect. When there is an
effect, there is no cause. And if we appeal to temporal overlap, we
inherit all of the problems with precedence, simultaneity, and
collections. In introducing the idea of a cause being "joined" with its
effect *(′brel-ba), Nāgārjuna*[]{#calibre_link-1990} is introducing a
putative causal link into the discussion. One who proposes simultaneity
or temporal overlap of cause with effect might be doing so in order to
make possible such a link. But Nāgārjuna here claims that positing that
link does not overcome the temporal difficulties he has presented.

In XX: 11-15, Nā[]{#calibre_link-1991}gārjuna summarizes the results of
these arguments. Causes, whether single or composite, cannot precede,
coincide with, or follow their effects; causes cannot produce their
effects in isolation, nor can collections of causes inherently produce
their effects:

[]{#calibre_link-468}11. Moreover, if not joined with its cause,

What effect can be made to arise?

Neither seen nor unseen by causes

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1992}
:::

Are effects produced.

Here Nāgārjuna returns to his critique of the idea of a causal nexus. He
points out that though that idea has been shown to be incoherent, it is
the only way that one can make sense of a real causal link or of
inherently existent production. So in its absence, we cannot make sense
of the production of an effect[]{#calibre_link-1993} by its cause. In
the last two lines, Nāgārjuna makes use of the strange metaphor of a
cause seeing its effect to denote this link
*(thongs-ba).*[]{#calibre_link-727}[^100^](#calibre_link-220){.nounder}
This is clearly a metaphor for this link, suggesting that whether it is
forged by contiguity or by some other means at a distance, it will be
explanatorily impotent.

12\. There is never a simultaneous[]{#calibre_link-1994} connection

Of a past effect

With a past, a nonarisen,

Or an arisen cause.

13\. There is never a simultaneous connection

Of a an arisen effect

With a past, a nonarisen,

Or an arisen cause.

14\. There is never a simultaneous connection

Of a nonarisen effect

With a past, a nonarisen,

Or an arisen cause.

15\. Without connecting,

How can a cause produce an effect?

Where there is connection,

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1995}
:::

How can a cause produce an effect?

At this point, Nāgārjuna turns directly to the connection between
emptiness and the dependence of effects on collections of
conditions.[]{#calibre_link-397} The opponent now asks how a cause or
collection of causes that does not contain the effect in any way can
produce that effect:

16\. If the cause is empty of an effect,

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1996}
:::

How can it produce an effect?

If the cause is not empty of an effect,

How can it produce an effect?

Nāgārjuna, echoing the argument of Chapter I, replies that only if cause
and effect are empty can production be understood. The next verse
explains this in more detail:

17\. A nonempty effect does not arise.

The nonempty would not cease.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-1997}
:::

This nonempty would be

The nonceased and the nonarisen.

If the effect were nonempty, as the opponent presupposes in wondering
how the effect could be produced from empty causes, then since the
inherently existent depends on nothing, the effect would be unproduced
and would never cease. But there are no such things. So the putative
problem case, the nonempty effect of empty causes, is not
even[]{#calibre_link-1998} possible.

18\. How can the empty arise?

How can the empty cease?

The empty will hence also

Be the nonceased and nonarisen.

Nāgārjuna emphasizes here the double edge of the ontology of emptiness.
Even though it is in virtue of the fact that conventional entities are
constantly arising and ceasing that they are empty, their
emptiness[]{#calibre_link-1999} entails that they do not, from the
ultimate standpoint, arise, cease, or abide at all. This is an eloquent
statement of the interpenetration of the ultimate and the conventional
truths: The very ground on the basis of which emptiness is asserted is
denied reality through the understanding of emptiness itself. The
emptiness of phenomena is, after all, asserted on the basis of their
momentary impermanence.[]{#calibre_link-2000} But that impermanence and
the very []{#calibre_link-359}existence of the impermanent objects
asserted to be empty is not even present from the ultimate standpoint.
Yet that, rather than constituting a self-refutation, constitutes a
self-confirmation. For if anything were apparent from the ultimate
standpoint, that phenomenon would be nonempty. It is the absence of any
such phenomenon---not its presence---that confirms[]{#calibre_link-2001}
the analysis and that prevents it from lapsing into a view, in the
pernicious
sense.[]{#calibre_link-729}[^101^](#calibre_link-221){.nounder}

19\. For cause and effect to be identical

Is not tenable.

For cause and effect to be different

Is not tenable.

Nāgārjuna here returns to the business of mobilizing destructive
dilemmas against the view that any dependence of effects on
collocations[]{#calibre_link-2002} of conditions could be inherently
existent. The argument in XX: 20 is based on the dichotomy of identity
or difference of cause and effect and is drawn from Chapter I:

20\. If cause and effect were identical,

Produced and producer would be identical.

If cause and effect were different,

Cause and noncause would be alike.

For the relation at issue in this chapter to be inherently existent,
the[]{#calibre_link-2003} collection of conditions would have either to
be identical in nature or different in nature from the effect. If
identical, we would have the absurd consequence that the effect was
self-caused. But if the effect is totally different in essence, we have
no explanation of how *that* collection of conditions produced *that*
effect.

21\. If an effect had entitihood,

What could have caused it to arise?

[]{#calibre_link-2004}If an effect had no entitihood,

What could have caused it to arise?

This attack on the inherent status of the relation between conditions
and effects focuses on arising itself. The effect must either
[]{#calibre_link-2005}have entitihood or not. If it does, its being
caused to arise is self-contradictory. If not, though, from the ultimate
standpoint it does not arise. It would follow from either that there is
no inherently[]{#calibre_link-2006} existent arising and, so, no
inherent production from a collection of conditions. The next verse
makes this same point from the side of the collection. If the effect
produced is not inherently produced, the collection does not inherently
produce it. If not, it is not an inherently productive collection:

22\. If something is not producing an effect,

It is not tenable to attribute causality.

[]{#calibre_link-2007}If it is not tenable to attribute causality,

Then of what will the effect be?

23\. If the combination

Of causes and conditions

Is not self-produced,

How does it produce an effect?

The ground of an inherently existent relation of production must be
inherently existent. But then it could depend on nothing else. It would
have to be self-produced. But this is not claimed for the collection
of[]{#calibre_link-2008} conditions or the relation between them and the
effect by the opponent here. It couldn't be. For the whole point of
moving to a collection is to avoid the problems of production from a
single cause. But collections depend upon their parts and upon the
causes of those parts. So no such collection can be self-produced. So,
while Nāgārjuna[]{#calibre_link-2009} can certainly grant that effects
are dependent upon collections of conditions, it cannot be that those
collections or that dependence exist inherently.

24\. Therefore, not made by combination,

And not without a combination can the effect arise.

If there is no effect,

Where can there be a combination of conditions?

Combinations of conditions, just like individual conditions and just
like their[]{#calibre_link-2010} effects, can only be conceived of as
empty of inherent existence.

## **[]{#calibre_link-294 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-60 .calibre4}Chapter XXI  Examination of Becoming and Destruction** {#chapter-xxi-examination-of-becoming-and-destruction-1 .h1}

In this chapter, Nāgārjuna examines the phenomenon of momentary
impermanence. At this point in the dialectic, one might suggest that
since the emptiness of phenomena derives directly from their
decomposition into momentary time-slices and from the fact that they are
constantly coming[]{#calibre_link-2013} into existence and being
destroyed, that process of momentary arising and destruction itself
ought to be real in the strong sense. Nāgārjuna, by way of completing
the discussion of the nature of conventional phenomena, demonstrates the
emptiness of even arising and destruction themselves as a prelude to the
final section of the text,[]{#calibre_link-2014} that discussing the
nature of the ultimate and its relation to conventional reality.

1\. Destruction does not occur without becoming.

It does not occur together with it.

Becoming does not occur without destruction.

It does not occur together with it.

This first verse announces the final stage in the argument to be
developed. Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2015}rjuna will show that destruction
and becoming are both mutually incompatible and that they are mutually
entailing. It []{#calibre_link-2016}will then follow that if they are
inherently existent, they have contradictory properties.

2\. How could there be destruction

Without becoming?

How could there be death without birth?

There is no destruction without becoming.

Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2017}rjuna argues that, absent something coming
into being, there is no sense in which it can be destroyed. So
destruction presupposes becoming.

3\. How could destruction and becoming

Occur simultaneously?

Death and birth

Do not occur simultaneously.

But they cannot exist simultaneously. For then the same entity would
have contradictory properties.

4\. How could there be becoming

Without destruction?

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2018}
:::

For impermanence

Is never absent from entities.

Since all phenomena are impermanent, as has been forcefully argued in
earlier chapters, anything that comes into existence passes out of
existence.

5\. How could destruction

And becoming occur simultaneously?

Just as birth and death

Do not occur simultaneously.

6\. How, when things cannot

Be established as existing,

With, or apart from one[]{#calibre_link-2019} another,

Can they be established at all?

[]{#calibre_link-2020}This is the argument to this stage: Becoming and
destruction are mutually contradictory. So they cannot be properties of
the same thing at the same time. But everything that is coming into
existence is at a stage in a process that culminates in its destruction.
So everything that is becoming is at the same time being destroyed.
Everything that is being[]{#calibre_link-2021} destroyed is in a later
stage of a process that earlier resulted in its coming into existence
and, indeed, is coming to exist in some other form. So everything that
is being destroyed is also becoming. So becoming and destruction cannot
coexist, but cannot exist apart. Hence they cannot exist independently
at all.

7\. There is no becoming of the disappeared.

There is no becoming of the nondisappeared.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2022}
:::

There is no destruction of the disappeared.

There is no destruction of the nondisappeared.

This verse offers an epigrammatic summary of the previous argument: All
phenomena, when analyzed closely, resolve into ephemeral moments,
constantly disappearing to be succeeded by later stages of what are
conventionally identified as the same objects. So everything that has
ever existed has disappeared.[]{#calibre_link-2023} Such a thing cannot
be coming into existence. But no nondisappeared thing ever comes into
existence. For as soon as it exists, it disappears. Similarly such
things cannot be in the process of destruction. But nothing that is not
ephemeral is destroyed either. Given this ephemeral nature of phenomena,
establishing becoming and destruction as distinct, independent processes
is impossible. This claim[]{#calibre_link-2024} is made directly in XXI:
8:

8\. When no entities exist,

There is no becoming or destruction.

Without becoming and destruction,

There are no existent entities.

In the next verse, Nāgārjuna connects this point directly to emptiness
and to inherent existence, pointing out both that emptiness precludes
the inherent establishment of becoming[]{#calibre_link-2025} and
destruction []{#calibre_link-542}and that positing inherently existent
phenomena would do no better:

9\. It is not tenable for the empty

To become or to be destroyed.

It is not tenable for the nonempty

To become or to be destroyed.

The empty cannot come to be or be destroyed simply because there is no
basis for the predication. With no entities, there is nothing to be
brought into existence or to be destroyed.[]{#calibre_link-2026} But if
we posit nonempty phenomena, their independence and consequent
permanence preclude their coming to be or destruction.

10\. It is not tenable

That destruction and becoming are identical.

It is not tenable

That destruction and becoming are different.

They cannot be identical because they are contradictory predicates. But
every destruction is a coming to be and vice versa. Hence when
conceived[]{#calibre_link-2027} of inherently, they can be neither
identical nor different; when conceived of inherently, they cannot
exist:

11\. If you think you see both

Destruction and becoming,

Then you see destruction and becoming

Through impaired vision.

In the next two verses, Nāgārjuna addresses coming to be. He points out
that if it is conceived of as truly[]{#calibre_link-2028} existent then
it must satisfy at least one of the alternatives represented in each of
the following two tetralemmas. But it cannot:

12\. An entity does not arise from an entity.

An entity does not arise from a nonentity.

A nonentity does not arise from a nonentity.

A nonentity does not arise from an entity.

[]{#calibre_link-2029}The first alternative is precluded because
inherently existent and distinct phenomena,[]{#calibre_link-2030}
Nāgārjuna has argued, cannot be related dependently. The second is
precluded because that would involve production from nothing. The third
would fail to count as inherently existent production, and from the
standpoint of one who posits inherent existence as a guarantor of
reality, would only amount to the production of the imaginary
in[]{#calibre_link-2031} any case. The final alternative again would not
amount to real production of anything.

13\. An entity does not arise from itself.

It is not arisen from another.

It is not arisen from itself and another.

How can it be arisen?

This verse simply recapitulates the argument of Chapter I in the service
of the conclusion that arising cannot be conceived of as an independent
phenomenon. Nā[]{#calibre_link-2032}gārjuna now draws more general
conclusions regarding the implication of the view that existence amounts
to inherent existence for the extreme positions. He develops in the next
two verses a nice reductio ad absurdum:

14\. If one accepts the existence of entities,

Permanence and the view of complete nonexistence follow.

For these entities

Must be both permanent and[]{#calibre_link-2033} impermanent.

If one thinks that any existent entity must exist inherently, then one
is forced simultaneously to embrace the extremes of nihilism and
reification. One must reify because any existent must be treated as
inherently existent and hence permanent. But upon observing the
impermanence of phenomena, one will be driven to nihilism since their
impermanence would entail their lack of inherent[]{#calibre_link-2034}
existence and hence their complete nonexistence. An opponent, however,
can be imagined to reply as follows:

15\. If one accepts the existence of entities

Nonexistence and permanence will not follow.

Cyclic existence is the continuous

Becoming and destruction of causes and effects.

[]{#calibre_link-444}If Nāgārjuna is correct, this objection goes,
there[]{#calibre_link-2035} is a constant becoming and destruction of
causally related phenomena. This, after all, is the heart of the
Mādhyamika analysis of phenomenal reality. But if that is so, these
phenomena that are becoming and being destroyed must exist. Otherwise,
what comes into and passes out of existence? It is these entities, this
opponent argues, that we must posit. And from
positing[]{#calibre_link-2036} such entities, neither their complete
nonexistence nor their permanence follows. For they are by definition
impermanently existent. Nāgārjuna replies in the next verse:

16\. If cyclic existence is the continuous

Becoming and destruction of causes and effects,

Then from the nonarising of the destroyed

Follows the nonexistence of cause.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2037}
:::

Given the pervasiveness of dependent arising, the impermanence of all
causes and effects, and the emptiness of the relation of dependence
itself, causes and effects themselves must be regarded as noninherently
existent. For the person who equates existence with inherent existence,
this forces the denial of the very becoming and destruction he has
posited as the only inherently existent phenomena.[]{#calibre_link-2038}
The point against the objection asserted in the previous verse is this:
The very fact that constant becoming and destruction characterizes
reality entails that at no point can anything be identified as an entity
in the robust sense---a thing with a nature that persists over time. The
very phenomena the opponent wants to posit as existent in order to make
sense of the series of becoming and destruction[]{#calibre_link-2039}
are, when that series is taken seriously, themselves nonexistent. But
the kind of full existence the opponent feels compelled to posit is in
any case not only impossible given this situation, but unnecessary as
well. Nāgārjuna now turns to the soteriological implications of this
view of becoming, destruction, and entitihood:

17\. If entities[]{#calibre_link-2040} exist with entitihood,

Then their nonexistence would make no sense.

But at the time of nirvāṇa,

Cyclic existence ceases completely, having been pacified.

[]{#calibre_link-410}If we thought that anything had inherent
existence---whether entities, processes, or arising and its
determinants---that could not possibly cease in
nirvāṇ[]{#calibre_link-2041}a. So this view would render Buddhist
soteriology incoherent and is therefore, since it purports to be a view
of the nature of cyclic existence by contrast with nirvāṇa, untenable.

The next three verses sum up the results of this investigation regarding
the possibility of conceiving of empirical reality as consisting of a
series of momentary phenomena,[]{#calibre_link-2042} each one of which
gives rise to the next through an inherently real nexus of destruction
and becoming. The structure of the argument is by now familiar:

18\. If the final one has ceased,

The existence of a first one makes no sense.

If the final one has not ceased,

The existence of a first one makes no sense.

If the momentary phenomenon prior to a present momentary phenomenon has
ceased prior[]{#calibre_link-2043} to the arising of the present one,
there is no basis for that arising. But if it has not ceased, then its
destruction cannot be an occasion for the arising of the subsequent
event. So the prior momentary phenomenon can neither have ceased nor not
ceased.

19\. If when the final one was ceasing,

Then the first was arising,

The one ceasing would be one.

The one arising would be another.

That[]{#calibre_link-2044} is, if we say that the cessation of the
previous momentary phenomenon is simultaneous with the arising of its
successor, then being simultaneous but distinct, the two phenomena are
separable and hence independent. If so, there is no basis for positing
any connection between them. This is yet another application of the
principle of the independence of separable phenomena.

20\. If, absurdly, the[]{#calibre_link-2045} one arising

And the one ceasing were the same,

Then whoever is dying with the aggregates

Is also arising.

[]{#calibre_link-543}Finally, we don't want to identify arising and
ceasing, claiming that they are the same phenomenon, since they are by
definition contraries. It would be tantamount, Nāgārjuna claims, to
saying that a person who is dying is
simultaneously[]{#calibre_link-2046} being born. From the standpoint of
one who wants to posit arising and destruction as the two complementary
inherently existent bases of cyclic existence, it would hardly do to say
that they are one and the same thing.

21\. Since the series of cyclic existence is not evident

In the three times,

If it is not in the three times,

How could there be a series of cyclic existence?

And finally, if[]{#calibre_link-2047} we cannot conceive of the domain
of conventional phenomena as inherently existent in time, there is no
sense in suggesting that it has some kind of transtemporal existence.
The object of analysis here is the conventional world we inhabit. So,
Nāgārjuna concludes, we cannot, upon analysis, resolve the domain of
conventional phenomena into[]{#calibre_link-2048} a series of constantly
arising, constantly ceasing, yet individually inherently existent
momentary phenomena, connected to one another and characterized by
inherently real arising and ceasing. As this target ontology was among
the subtlest of the pre-Mādhyamika views of the nature of reality,
dependent arising, and impermanence (and is indeed not by any means a
relic[]{#calibre_link-2049} within Theravada Buddhism) and as it
represents a plausible interpretation of fundamental Buddhist tenets,
this refutation is an appropriate close to the portion of the text
concerned directly with the analysis of the fundamental structure of
conventional reality. With this in hand, Nāgārjuna turns in the final
six chapters to topics[]{#calibre_link-2050} concerned with the nature
of ultimate reality: buddhahood, prominent incorrect views about the
ultimate, the Four Noble Truths and emptiness, nirvāṇa, and the twelve
limbs of dependent origination.

## **[]{#calibre_link-316 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-61 .calibre4}Chapter XXII  Examination of the Tathāgata** {#chapter-xxii-examination-of-the-tathāgata-1 .h1}

This is the first of the final set of chapters in the text, all of which
deal directly with topics concerning the ultimate truth and its relation
to the conventional. The doctrine of the two truths, central to all
Mahāyāna Buddhist philosophy, is most explicitly[]{#calibre_link-2053}
enunciated in Chapter XXIV. But it is present as a pervasive theme in
the text. There is a conventional world of dependently arisen objects
with properties, of selves and their properties and relations. And in
that world there is conventional truth: Snow is white. Grass is green.
Individual humans are distinct from one another and from their material
possessions. But there is also an ultimate truth[]{#calibre_link-2054}
about this world: It is empty (of inherent existence). None of these
objects or persons exists from its own side (independently of
convention). From the ultimate point of view there are no individual
objects or relations between them. Just how these two truths are
connected, and how we are to understand them simultaneously, is the
central problem of Mādhyamika epistemology[]{#calibre_link-2055} and
metaphysics, and from the standpoint of Mādhyamika, a satisfactory
solution is essential for Buddhist soteriological practice and ethics as
well.

But discourse about the ultimate is perilous in a number of ways. First,
and most obviously, there is the ever-present danger of talking sheer
nonsense. For the ultimate truth is, in some sense, ineffable in that
all[]{#calibre_link-2056} words and their referents are by definition
conventional. The dualities generated by the use of terms that denote
[]{#calibre_link-288}individuals or classes as distinct from others or
from their complements are unavoidable in discourse and nonexistent in
the ultimate. So one must be very careful to kick away all ladders
promptly. At the same time, there are things that one can say without
lapsing into nonsense, by[]{#calibre_link-2057} way of ostention, even
from the bottom rungs.

But the other grave danger is this: By distinguishing the conventional
from the ultimate, it is tempting to disparage the former in contrast to
the latter, developing a sort of theory of one truth and one falsehood.
This is done if one reifies the entities associated with the ultimate,
such as emptiness or impermanence, or the Four Noble Truths,
or[]{#calibre_link-2058} the Buddha. Then one treats these as real,
intrinsically existent phenomena. The conventional then becomes the
world of illusion. It is to combat this tendency to treat the
conventional world as illusory through treating such apparently
transcendent entities as inherently existent that Nāgārjuna develops
these final chapters. Perhaps[]{#calibre_link-2059} the most obvious
candidate for reification in a Buddhist context is the Buddha himself,
and that is where Nāgārjuna begins:

1\. Neither the aggregates, nor different from the aggregates,

The aggregates are not in him, nor is he in the aggregates.

The Tathāgata does not possess the aggregates.

What is the[]{#calibre_link-2060} Tathāgata?
[]{#calibre_link-731}[^102^](#calibre_link-224){.nounder}

This form of analytic demonstration of the nonexistence of the self
through an analysis of its possible relationship to the aggregates,
often referred to as the "fivefold analysis," is developed with great
elegance by Candrakïrti in *Mādhyamakāvatāra*.
Nā[]{#calibre_link-2061}gārjuna proposes four of five possible relations
the self bears to the aggregates in this first verse, and the fifth is
considered in the next two verses. Here the self in question is the
Buddha's self, but the analysis is perfectly general as a refutation of
any assertion of an inherently existent personal self. That self cannot
be the aggregates []{#calibre_link-2062}for two
reasons:[]{#calibre_link-2063} First, the self posited is meant to be
unitary, and the aggregates are plural. Second, the aggregates are
constantly undergoing change, while the self that is posited is meant to
endure as a single entity.

But the self can't be different from the aggregates either. For anything
that happens to the aggregates happens to the self, and vice versa. If I
hurt my body, I hurt *myself.* If you lose your[]{#calibre_link-2064}
vision, *you* become blind. And in the present case, buddhahood is
presumably attained by a purification of the aggregates through
practice. If the aggregates were entirely different from the self, it is
not clear how purifying *them* would lead the *practicioner* to
buddhahood.

The self cannot stand outside the aggregates as a basis for them, for if
we strip away all of the aggregates, there is
nothing[]{#calibre_link-2065} left as an independent support. But nor is
the self somehow contained in the aggregates as a hidden core, and for
the same reason. When we strip away all of the aggregates in thought,
nothing remains of the self.

2\. If the Buddha depended on the aggregates,

He would not exist through an essence.

Not existing through an essence,

How could he exist through otherness-essence?

The fifth possibility[]{#calibre_link-2066} is that the self, in this
case the Buddha's self, is distinct from but dependent upon the
aggregates. But from the standpoint of positing an inherently existent
Buddha this is unsatisfactory. For if the Buddha were dependent, he
would lack an essence and would be empty. And the situation can't be
saved by suggesting that he has an essence through a relation to another
since that presupposes[]{#calibre_link-2067} essential difference, which
presupposes that both the Buddha and the aggregates on which he is
supposed to depend have individual essences. This is reinforced in the
first two lines of the next verse:

3\. Whatever is dependent on another entity,

Its selfhood is not appropriate.

It is not tenable that what lacks a self

Could be a Tathāgata.

[]{#calibre_link-430}The reifier in the last[]{#calibre_link-2068} two
lines of this verse and in the next asks how it is possible that a real
Buddha could lack a self. What then would be the thing that practiced,
that became enlightened and that preached the Dharma?

4\. If there is no essence,

How could there be otherness-essence?

Without possessing essence or otherness-essence,

What is the Tathāgata?

5\. If without depending[]{#calibre_link-2069} on the aggregates

There were a Tathāgata,

Then now he would be depending on them.

Therefore he would exist through dependence.

That is, on the opponent's view, even if the Buddha had no dependence on
the aggregates prior to attaining Buddhahood, in order to act as a
Buddha, he must depend upon his consciousness, perception, body, and so
forth. So if we suppose[]{#calibre_link-2070} that the Buddha is now
inherently existent and omniscient and compassionate and so forth, we
must assume that he exists through dependence on his aggregates in some
sense.

6\. Inasmuch as there is no Tathāgata

Dependent upon the aggregates,

How could something that is not dependent

Come to be so?

We already know that the Buddha as a sentient being in
saṃ[]{#calibre_link-2071}sāra, prior to entering nirvāṇa, could not
exist dependent on the aggregates. This is a straightforward consequence
of the argument for the nonexistence of a self distinct from the
aggregates and from the fact that in order to depend upon the
aggregates, the self would need to be distinct from them. And so,
Nā[]{#calibre_link-2072}gārjuna points out, it would be odd to think
that an entity not dependent upon the aggregates in saṃsāra would come
to be so upon entering nirvāṇsa. It would, of course, be particularly
odd for someone defending the target of this critique. Anyone holding
such a position[]{#calibre_link-2073} would hardly be expected to
ascribe to the Buddha a *more* dependent status in nirvāṇa than in
saṃsāra.

[]{#calibre_link-292}7. There is no appropriation.

There is no appropriator.

Without appropriation

How can there be a Tathāgata?

The appropriation here is the appropriation of
aggregates[]{#calibre_link-2074} as one's own. Without it, there can be
no sense of individual identity. Since the opponent is positing the
Tathāgata as an inherently existent individual, he must hold him to have
his own aggregates.

8\. Having been sought in the fivefold way,

What, being neither identical nor different,

Can be thought to be the Tathāgata

Through grasping?

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2075}
:::

But, as we have seen in the first two verses of this chapter, there is
no way that the Buddha can be thought of as inherently existent in
relation to those aggregates. So we can't divorce the Buddha from the
aggregates. Nor can we understand the Buddha as inherently existing
given that he must have aggregates.

9\. Whatever grasping there is

Does not exist through essence.

And when something[]{#calibre_link-2076} does not exist through itself,

It can never exist through otherness-essence.

So the Buddha does not exist inherently in virtue of his own essence.
Nor does he exist inherently in virtue of some property of his
aggregates or, for that matter, in virtue of anything else that is
other, such as an inherently existent buddha-nature or state of
nirvāṇ[]{#calibre_link-2077}a.

10\. Thus grasping and grasper

Together are empty in every respect.

How can an empty Tathāgata

Be known through the empty?

So we must conceive of the Buddha and of all that pertains to him as
empty of inherent existence. But the question then arises:
[]{#calibre_link-421}What can we say or know of such an empty Buddha?
This is a fundamental question not only with regard to our
knowledge[]{#calibre_link-2078} of the nature of enlightenment, but also
with regard to our ability to say anything coherent about emptiness
itself and empty phenomena.

11\. "Empty" should not be asserted.

"Nonempty" should not be asserted.

Neither both nor neither should be asserted.

They are only used nominally.

This negative tetralemma is a crucial verse for understanding the
relation between discourse on the conventional[]{#calibre_link-2079}
level and the understanding of emptiness or the ultimate truth.
Nāgārjuna has been urging all along that ultimately all things are
empty. It would be easy to interpret him to mean that from the ultimate
standpoint, we can say of phenomena that they are empty. But here he
quite deliberately undermines that interpretation, claiming
instead[]{#calibre_link-2080} that nothing can be literally said of
things from such a standpoint. For ultimately there is no entity of
which emptiness or nonemptiness can be predicated. Nor can we say that
things are neither empty nor nonempty. For that would contradict the
fact that from the standpoint of one using conventional language and
cognition, it is correct to characterize phenomena as empty. The central
claim in[]{#calibre_link-2081} this verse is that all assertion, to the
extent that it is true at all, is at best nominally true. Discourse
about the ultimate character of things is not exempt from this
generalization. Predication always requires an entity of which the
predicate can be true; and the emptiness of phenomena guarantees that
from the ultimate standpoint, there are no phenomena to be empty. The
language is hence at[]{#calibre_link-2082} best only
ostensive.[]{#calibre_link-733}[^103^](#calibre_link-225){.nounder} The
next verse generalizes this observation:

[]{#calibre_link-442}12. How can the tetralemma of permanent and
impermanent, etc.,

Be true of the peaceful?

How can the tetralemma of finite, infinite, etc.,

Be true of the peaceful?

13\. One who grasps the view that the Tathāgata exists,

Having seized the Buddha,

Constructs conceptual fabrications

About one[]{#calibre_link-2083} who has achieved nirvāṇa.

Here Nāgārjuna returns to the problem of ascribing inherent existence to
the Buddha in the context of thinking about phenomena from the ultimate
standpoint. The problem is that, as Nāgārjuna has
argued[]{#calibre_link-2084} above, the only grounds for asserting the
inherent existence of the Buddha would be on the grounds of the inherent
existence of the aggregates and some view about the relations of the
self to the aggregates. And we have seen that to be untenable. Moreover,
since upon achieving nirvāṇa, on most Buddhist doctrine, one ceases to
identify a self and[]{#calibre_link-2085} aggregates, it would follow
that upon achieving nirvāṇa one would cease to exist. This is doubly
problematic. On the one hand, it forces one to see nirvāṇa as complete
annihilation, which doesn't make it look quite so attractive. On the
other hand, it forces the conclusion that the Buddha is
either[]{#calibre_link-2086} not in nirvāṇa (since he exists), which is
paradoxical in that buddhahood should guarantee nirvāṇa, or that he both
exists (as a genuine buddha) and does not exist (in virtue of being in
nirvāṇa), which is contradictory.

14\. Since he is by nature empty,

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2087}
:::

The thought that the Buddha

Exists or does not exist

After nirvāṇa is not appropriate.

Nāgārjuna here draws on the results of XXII: 11, 12 to point out that
one can evade all of these paradoxes by simply rejecting the language of
existence and nonexistence when these are read
inherently.[]{#calibre_link-2088} Empty things exist conventionally; but
about their ultimate status, nothing can be literally said. Of course we
can say that the Buddha is empty and, hence, neither really existent nor
completely []{#calibre_link-431}nonexistent. But that, Nāgārjuna is
arguing in this chapter, can be only understood in a purely negative
sense. The ultimate nature of things[]{#calibre_link-2089} is perhaps
*shown* by it, to use a Wittgensteinian metaphor, but cannot be *said*
in this
language.[]{#calibre_link-735}[^104^](#calibre_link-226){.nounder}

15\. Those who develop mental fabrications with regard to the Buddha,

Who has gone beyond all fabrications,

As a consequence of those cognitive fabrications,

Fail to see the Tathāgata.

To see buddhahood for what it is---to see things as a buddha sees
them---one must[]{#calibre_link-2090} see things independently of the
categories that determine an ontology of entities and a dichotomy of
existence and nonexistence. That this is inconceivable to us, for
Nāgārjuna, only indicates the fact that we are trapped in conventional
reality through the force of the delusion of reification. But we can,
through using the Mā[]{#calibre_link-2091}dhyamika dialectic, come to
see the nature of our predicament, the possibility of transcending it,
and even the nature of that transcendence. That, however, requires us to
acknowledge the merely nominal character of conceptual imputation.

16\. Whatever is the essence of the Tathāgata,

That is the essence of the world.

The Tathāgata has[]{#calibre_link-2092} no essence.

The world is without essence.

This crucial final verse emphasizes again the lack of any fundamental
nature of entities. Emptiness is the final nature of all things, from
rocks to dogs to human beings to
buddhas.[]{#calibre_link-736}[^105^](#calibre_link-227){.nounder} This
fact entails, for Mahāyāna philosophers, the possibility of any sentient
being to be fundamentally transformed---to[]{#calibre_link-2093} attain
enlightenment.

[]{#calibre_link-2094}But this is so, paradoxically, because ultimately
there is no fundamental transformation, because there is nothing to
transform. In Chapters XXIV and XXV below, we will see the dramatic
consequences of this line of reasoning.

## **[]{#calibre_link-424 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-62 .calibre4}Chapter XXIII  Examination of Errors** {#chapter-xxiii-examination-of-errors-1 .h1}

This chapter continues the investigation of the relation between cyclic
existence and nirvāṇa by asking whether the fundamental defilements and
the four basic cognitive errors, which according to orthodox Buddhist
doctrine bind us to saṃsāra, themselves inherently[]{#calibre_link-2097}
exist and by asking how it is possible to abandon them and enter
nirvāṇa. The fundamental defilements are desire, hatred, and confusion:
the desire for things that are not desirable, the aversion to things to
which it is not reasonable to be averse, confusion about the actual
nature of entities. These, according to most strains of Buddhist
philosophy,[]{#calibre_link-2098} are the bases of afflicted action,
which in turn leads to further grasping and error. The four basic errors
or erroneous philosophical theses are: (1) There is a permanent self
among the five personal aggregates. (2) There is real happiness in
saṃsāra. (3) The body is pure---that is, that it is a real source of
happiness. (4) There is a permanent self[]{#calibre_link-2099} distinct
from the aggregates.

If these defilements and errors were inherent properties of the self,
that might serve as a ground for the inherent existence of saṃsāra and
its phenomena, to the extent that saṃsāra is grounded in these
phenomena. Moreover, though, if these defilements and errors
were[]{#calibre_link-2100} inherently existent, it is hard to see how
nirvāṇa is possible since it requires their elimination. But on the
other hand, if these defilements do not exist, it is hard to see why
there is []{#calibre_link-392}saṃsāra at all and why we are not already
in nirvāṇa. And if they[]{#calibre_link-2101} are merely illusions, why
isn't the distinction between saṃsāra and nirvāna merely an illusion;
why isn't suffering merely an illusion? In short, why isn't illusion
merely an illusion? This chapter is devoted to answering these
fundamental questions in Buddhist soteriological theory.

1\. Desire, hatred, and confusion[]{#calibre_link-2102} all

Arise from thought, it is said.

They all depend on

The pleasant, the unpleasant, and errors.

Without reifying entities, a cognitive operation, there is no basis for
desire for those entities, of aversion from them, and no confusion
regarding their mode of existence. Seeing things as pleasant or
unpleasant in themselves depends upon confusing our desire or aversion
with respect to them[]{#calibre_link-2103} with properties they have in
themselves. The desire and aversion in turn depend upon our attributing
pleasantness and unpleasantness to the entities. It is a tight and
vicious circle of attribution and emotional reaction, all depending upon
reification.

2\. Since whatever depends on the pleasant and the unpleasant

Does not exist through an essence,

The defilements

Do not really exist.

But[]{#calibre_link-2104} it follows from this that the defilements, in
virtue of depending on these attributions and upon our relation to
pleasant and unpleasant things, all of which are themselves empty, are
empty of inherent existence. Indeed, they are not only dependently
arisen, but depend upon things or features of those things already shown
to be empty.

3\. The self's existence or nonexistence

Has in no way been[]{#calibre_link-2105} established.

Without that, how could the defilements'

Existence or nonexistence be established?

[]{#calibre_link-446}Moreover, the defilements are meant to be
defilements of the self. But the self---the putative basis of those
defilements---cannot exist inherently. So the defilements, being
attributes of an empty phenomenon, cannot be nonempty. The following
verse reiterates that position:

4\. The defilements are somebody's.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2106}
:::

But that one has not been established.

Without that possessor,

The defilements are nobody's.

In the first line, an interlocutor points out that if there are
defilements at all there must be somebody whose defilements they are.
Nāgārjuna replies that we have already shown that there is no subject
for personal attributes in the many[]{#calibre_link-2107} discussions of
the relation between the self and its states previous to this (Chapters
III, IV, VIII, IX, XII, XIII, XVI, XVII, and XVIII). So whatever
analysis of defilement we develop, it will have to be one according to
which they presuppose no defiled individual.

5\. View the defilements as you view yourself:

They are not in the defiled in the fivefold way.

View the defiled as you view your[]{#calibre_link-2108} self:

It is not in the defilements in the fivefold way.

This verse recalls and applies the fivefold analysis of the self
developed in the previous chapter to the analysis of the defilements and
the defiled. They are not identical to the aggregates, completely
different from the aggregates, present as a basis of the aggregates,
contained in the aggregates as a core, or separate from or
dependent[]{#calibre_link-2109} upon the aggregates. The arguments
concerning the relation of the self to the aggregates can simply be
applied directly either to the defilements or to the defiled.

6\. The pleasant, the unpleasant, and the errors

Do not exist through essence.

Which pleasant, unpleasant, and errors

could the defilements depend upon?

[]{#calibre_link-428}Nor can we say that the defilements are inherently
existent in virtue of being[]{#calibre_link-2110} grounded in inherently
existent pleasantness, unpleasantness, and error. While it is true that
the latter are the basis of the defilements, they, too, Nāgārjuna will
argue, are empty.

7\. Form, sound, taste, touch,

Smell, and concepts of things: These six

Are thought of as the foundation of

Desire, hatred, and confusion.

8\. Form,[]{#calibre_link-2111} sound, taste, touch,

Smell, and concepts of things: These six

Should be seen as only like a city of the Gandharvas and

Like a mirage or a dream.

Sensory contact, perception, and cognition are the causal grounds of the
defilements. But as was shown in Chapter III, they are empty as well.

9\. How could the

Pleasant and unpleasant arise

In those that are like an illusory person

And like a[]{#calibre_link-2112} reflection?

Since the self and others have been demonstrated to be empty and
pleasantness and unpleasantness must be properties of one, the other, or
both, there can be no inherently existent basis for pleasantness or
unpleasantness. They themselves must also therefore be empty.

10\. We say that the unpleasant

Is dependent upon the pleasant,

Since without depending on the pleasant there is[]{#calibre_link-2113}
none.

It follows that the pleasant is not tenable.

11\. We say that the pleasant

Is dependent upon the unpleasant.

Without the unpleasant there wouldn't be any.

It follows that the unpleasant is not tenable.

Moreover, pleasant and unpleasant are mutually dependent. Nāgārjuna here
claims that "pleasant" and "unpleasant" are not
[]{#calibre_link-427}absolute[]{#calibre_link-2114} but rather
comparative terms and, hence, essentially interdefined. If this is so,
then since their referents depend upon each other for their satisfaction
of these descriptions, neither property can exist inherently.

12\. Where there is no pleasant,

How can there be desire?

Where there is no unpleasant,

How can there be anger?

And since these are the bases for desire and anger, desire
and[]{#calibre_link-2115} anger, arising from empty phenomena, must
themselves be seen as empty.

13\. If to grasp onto the view

"The impermanent is permanent" were an error,

Since in emptiness there is nothing impermanent,

How could that grasping be an error?

This verse adverts to the first of the four principal errors---that one
of the five aggregates, typically consciousness, is permanent. The
reason that it is held[]{#calibre_link-2116} by Buddhists to be an
error, of course, is that all of the aggregates are analyzed as
impermanent---hence the formulation in the second line, whose definite
description must be read de re. But, Nāgārjuna argues, since there are
no actual impermanent phenomena from the ultimate point of view, this
can't actually be seen as the false attribution[]{#calibre_link-2117} of
a property (permanence) to a real entity that actually has a contrary
property (impermanence). The point here is simply that in calling this
an error, one must be very careful not to commit a corresponding
error---to suggest that calling the impermanent *impermanent*
constitutes the assertion of an ultimate truth or of the presupposition
of the ultimate reality of impermanent phenomena. That
is[]{#calibre_link-2118} at best a true conventional assertion that
indicates the ultimate nature of things. This claim is made explicit in
XXIII: 14:

14\. If to grasp onto the view

"The impermanent is permanent" were an error,

Why isn't grasping onto the view

"In emptiness there is nothing impermanent" an error?

[]{#calibre_link-426}15. That by means of which there is grasping,

And the grasping, And the grasper, and all that is grasped:

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2119}
:::

All are being relieved.

It follows that there is no grasping.

The argument above addresses the first and fourth of the principal
errors directly. This verse hints at the generalization of this argument
to the other two. If there is no permanent self, there is nothing to do
the grasping that generates the view that there is happiness in samsāra
or to grasp onto the[]{#calibre_link-2120} body. Since all of these
errors are rooted in grasping and since any inherently existent grasping
would depend on an inherently existent grasper, these errors cannot be
inherently existent. The next two verses emphasize the nonexistence of
both the error and the one in error from the ultimate standpoint:

16\. If there is no grasping

Whether erroneous or otherwise,

Who will come to be in error?

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2121}
:::

Who will have no error?

17\. Error does not develop

In one who is in error.

Error does not develop

In one who is not in error.

And, Nāgārjuna points out, following the same pattern used in the
analysis of motion and redeployed numerous times in the text, we can't
think of error developing in one in whom error is arising. If the
error[]{#calibre_link-2122} is already arising in him, an independent
error cannot be developing there. Moreover, as error develops, the
person in whom it is developing changes, and no substrate for the
development of error can be found. It follows that really existent
error, conceived of as an independent phenomenon, is no more real than
its putative subject (but of course no less real, either):

18\. Error does not develop

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2123}
:::

In one in whom error is arising.

In whom does error develop?

Examine this on your own!

[]{#calibre_link-425}The next two verses mobilize a by now familiar
general argument against inherent existence specifically against the
inherent existence of error: Either error has arisen or it hasn't. If it
has, it depends on something and so is not inherently existent. If it
has not, it has not come to be and so is either[]{#calibre_link-2124}
nonexistent or unexplained. Moreover, if error is to be conceived as
inherently existent, it must arise from one of the four possible
sources: self, other, both, or neither. And all four possibilities have
been refuted for inherently existent entities in the general case in
Chapter I:

19\. If error is not arisen,

How could it come to exist?

If error has not arisen,

How could one be in error?

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2125}
:::

20\. Since an entity does not arise from itself,

Nor from another,

Nor from another and from itself,

How could one be in error?

Nāgārjuna now returns to the objects of the four principal errors and
points out that if they existed inherently, as the proponent of
inherently existent error would have it, they would be truly existent
and,[]{#calibre_link-2126} hence, would be nondeceptive ultimate truths.

21\. If the self and the pure,

The permanent and the blissful existed,

The self, the pure, the permanent,

And the blissful would not be deceptive.

But why is the opponent forced to think of the objects of inherently
existent error as inherently existent? That is, of course, an obviously
incoherent position. But the view characterized as an
error[]{#calibre_link-2127} must have some ontological basis. And the
self that is putatively in error has already been ruled out. So the only
remaining possibility is that the error is the perception of an
inherently real but at the same time deceptive object: a real but
nonexistent object. It is this that Nāgārjuna claims is incoherent.
Error then can []{#calibre_link-2128}neither[]{#calibre_link-2129} be an
objectless but inherently existent mental
phenomenon,[]{#calibre_link-738}[^106^](#calibre_link-229){.nounder} nor
can it be a subjectless perception of an inherently real but nonexistent
object. So in no way can error be grounded in anything substantial.

22\. If the self and the pure,

The permanent and the blissful did not exist,

The nonself, the impure, the permanent,

And suffering would not exist.

But at this point Nā[]{#calibre_link-2130}gārjuna draws quite a
surprising conclusion. These observations apply not only to the putative
objects of the errors, but also to those of Buddhist doctrine, at least
when it is given a substantialist reading. Continuing his critique of
the idea that assertions made from the standpoint of conventional truth
about the ultimate nature of things are literally true
from[]{#calibre_link-2131} the ultimate standpoint, Nāgārjuna points out
that the fact that there is no permanent self, no happiness in samsāra,
and no pure body does not entail that an impermanent self, suffering, or
an impure body are in any way inherently existent. That is, the objects
of correct conventional understanding are no[]{#calibre_link-2132} more
inherently existent than those of incorrect understanding. The truth of
even Nāgārjuna's own philosophical theory is not grounded in its
reference to independently existent, substantially real entities.

23\. Thus, through the cessation of error

Ignorance ceases.

When ignorance ceases

The compounded phenomena, etc., cease.

When[]{#calibre_link-2133} all error is abandoned and we see the world
aright, we are no longer ignorant of the true nature of things. But this
is not because we then apprehend things and their true nature. Rather we
apprehend that there are no things, per se, and that those posited from
our side have no nature to understand.

[]{#calibre_link-2134}24. If someone's defilements

Existed through his essence,

How could they be relinquished?

[]{#calibre_link-2135}Who could relinquish the existent?

Nāgārjuna reminds the substantialist at the end that if the defilements
or errors were inherent in the person and, hence, were part of his/her
essence, they would be permanent and, hence, could not be relinquished.
This would constitute a direct rejection of one of the most fundamental
tenets of the[]{#calibre_link-2136} Buddhist outlook---the possibility
of liberation.

25\. If someone's defilements

Did not exist through his essence,

How could they be relinquished?

Who could relinquish the nonexistent?

On the other hand, he reminds those who may have followed the argument
this far, but who may be tempted either to nihilism about the
defilements or to the subtler error of asserting that their dependence
and emptiness[]{#calibre_link-2137} is literally their ultimate nature,
that the defilements must be conventionally real in order to be
relinquished. They are, from the ultimate point of view, completely
unreal; from that point of view, there is no relinquishment of anything
at all. This, as we shall see, is an important harbinger of the
doctrines of the identity of the two truths and of
saṃsā[]{#calibre_link-2138}ra and nirvāṇa to be developed in the next
two chapters, which represent the climax of the text.

## **[]{#calibre_link-450 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-63 .calibre4}Chapter XXIV  Examination of the Four Noble Truths** {#chapter-xxiv-examination-of-the-four-noble-truths-1 .h1}

While Chapter XXIV ostensibly concerns the Four Buddhist Truths and the
way they are to be understood from the vantage point of emptiness, it is
really about the nature of emptiness itself and about the relation
between emptiness and conventional reality. As such, it is the
philosophical heart of *Mūlamadhyamakakā[]{#calibre_link-2141}rikā.* The
first six verses of the chapter (XXIV: 1-6) present a reply to
Nāgārjuna's doctrine of emptiness by an opponent charging the doctrine
with nihilism. The next eight verses (XXIV: 7-14) are primarily
rhetorical, castigating the opponent for his misunderstanding of
Mādhyamika.[]{#calibre_link-2142} The positive philosophical work begins
with XXIV: 15. From this point Nāgārjuna offers a theory of the
relationship between emptiness, dependent origination, and convention
and argues not only that these three can be understood as corelative,
but that if conventional things (or emptiness itself) were *nonempty,*
the very nihilism with which[]{#calibre_link-2143} the reificationist
opponent charges Mādhyamika would ensue. This tactic of arguing not only
against each extreme but of arguing that the contradictory extremes are
in fact mutually entailing is, as we have seen in earlier chapters, a
dialectical trademark of Nāgārjuna's philosophical method. In this
chapter,[]{#calibre_link-2144} it is deployed with exceptional elegance
and acuity.

[]{#calibre_link-415}The opponent opens the chapter by claiming that if
the entire phenomenal world were empty, nothing would in fact exist, a
conclusion absurd on its face and, more importantly, contradictory to
fundamental Buddhist tenets such as the Four Noble Truths (XXIV: 1-6) as
well as to conventional wisdom:

1\. If all of this is empty,

Neither arising,[]{#calibre_link-2145} nor ceasing,

Then for you, it follows that

The Four Noble Truths do not exist.

The Four Noble Truths are: (1) All life in cyclic existence is
suffering. (2) There is a cause of this suffering, namely, craving
caused by ignorance. (3) There is a release from suffering. (4) The path
to that release is the eightfold Buddhist path of right view, right
concentration, right mindfulness, right speech,[]{#calibre_link-2146}
right effort, right action, right morality, right livelihood. The Four
Noble Truths, preached by the Buddha in his first teaching after gaining
enlightenment, are the fundamental philosophical tenets of Buddhism. If
it were a consequence of Nāgārjuna's doctrine of emptiness that the Four
Noble Truths were in fact false or, more
radically,[]{#calibre_link-2147} nonexistent, that would constitute in
this philosophical context an immediate refutation of the position. This
is not because these assertions are articles of faith, in the sense of
revealed doctrine, but because anyone arguing within this framework has
accepted the arguments for them.

2\. If the Four Noble Truths do not exist,

Then knowledge, abandonment.

Meditation, and manifestation

Will[]{#calibre_link-2148} be completely impossible.

Once we reject the Four Noble Truths, the essential ingredients of
Buddhist practice become unintelligible. Knowledge of the ultimate
nature of things becomes impossible since all of the knowledge gained in
this tradition is knowledge of things that accords with the truths.
Abandonment of error and craving, and eventually of cyclic existence,
becomes unintelligible without[]{#calibre_link-2149} the context of the
analysis contained in the truths. Meditation loses its point. The
[]{#calibre_link-317}eightfold path becomes a path to nowhere. This all
amounts to a rejection of the entire Buddhist Dharma, one of the three
jewels in which Buddhists take refuge, the others being the
Buddha[]{#calibre_link-740}[^107^](#calibre_link-231){.nounder} and the
Sangha, or the spiritual community of Buddhist practicioners and
teachers.

3\. If these things do not exist,

[]{#calibre_link-2150}The four fruits will not arise.

Without the four fruits, there will be no attainers of the fruits.

Nor will there be the faithful.

4\. If so, the spiritual community will not exist.

Nor will the eight kinds of person.

If the Four Noble Truths do not exist,

There will be no true Dharma.

These verses highlight these implications regarding the Dharma, but also
point out that the rejection of[]{#calibre_link-2151} the Four Noble
Truths entails the nonexistence of the Sangha. For absent practice and
the fruits of the path---that is, realization and accomplishment---there
will be no practicioners and realizers.

5\. If there is no doctrine and spiritual community,

How can there be a Buddha?

If emptiness is conceived in this way,

The three jewels are contradicted.

The whole point of the Dharma and the Sangha[]{#calibre_link-2152} is to
make it possible to attain buddhahood. The Dharma provides the
philosophical insight and knowledge necessary for enlightenment; and the
Sangha provides the teachers, the encouragement, the models, the
opportunity for practice, and other support necessary for the strenuous
and perseverant practice of the path. The attainment of buddhahood
requires reliance on these two. So, if they are
rejected,[]{#calibre_link-2153} so is the possibility of buddhahood. So,
the opponent charges, Nāgārjuna's doctrine of emptiness, in virtue of
undermining []{#calibre_link-546}the Four Noble Truths, denies the
existence of the three refuges and makes Buddhism itself impossible.

6\. Hence you assert that there are no real fruits.

And no Dharma. The Dharma itself

And the conventional truth

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2154}
:::

Will be contradicted.

The implicit dilemma with which Nāgārjuna here confronts himself is
elegant. For as we have seen, the distinction between the two truths or
two vantage points---the ultimate and the conventional---is fundamental
to his own method. So when the opponent charges that the assertion of
the nonexistence of such things as[]{#calibre_link-2155} the Four Noble
Truths and of the arising, abiding, and ceasing of entities is
contradictory both to conventional wisdom and to the ultimate truth
(viz., that all phenomena are dependent, impermanent, merely arising,
abiding momentarily and ceasing, and only existing conventionally, empty
of inherent existence), Nāgārjuna is forced to[]{#calibre_link-2156}
defend himself on both fronts and to comment on the connection between
these standpoints.

Nāgārjuna launches the reply by charging the opponent with foisting the
opponent's own understanding of emptiness on Nāgārjuna. Though this is
not made as explicit in the text as one might[]{#calibre_link-2157}
like, it is important to note that the understanding Nāgārjuna has in
mind is one that, in the terms of Mādhyamika, reifies emptiness itself.
This will be made more explicit in XXIV: 16:

7\. We say that this understanding of yours

Of emptiness and the purpose of emptiness

And of the significance of emptiness[]{#calibre_link-2158} is incorrect.

As a consequence you are harmed by it.

8\. The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma

Is based on two truths:

A truth of worldly convention

And an ultimate truth.

This is the first explicit announcement of the two truths in the text.
It is important to note that they are introduced as two *truths,*
[]{#calibre_link-335}and that they are introduced as distinct. This will
be important to bear in mind later.[]{#calibre_link-2159} For it is
tempting, since one of the truths is characterized as an ultimate truth,
to think of the conventional as "less
true."[]{#calibre_link-742}[^108^](#calibre_link-232){.nounder}
Moreover, we will see later that while the truths are introduced as
quite distinct here, they are in another sense identified later. It will
be important to be very clear about the respective senses in which they
are distinct and one. The term translated here as
"truth[]{#calibre_link-2160} of worldly convention" (Tib: *kun-rdzob
bden-pa,* Skt: *samvrti-satya)* denotes a truth dependent upon tacit
agreement, an everyday truth, a truth about things as they appear to
accurate ordinary investigation, as judged by appropriate human
standards.[]{#calibre_link-743}[^109^](#calibre_link-233){.nounder} The
term "ultimate truth" (Tib: *dam-pa'idon gyi bdenpa*
[]{#calibre_link-491}Skt: *paramārtha-satya)* denotes the way things are
independent[]{#calibre_link-2161} of convention, or to put it another
way, the way things turn out to be when we subject them to analysis with
the intention of discovering the nature they have from their own side,
as opposed to the characteristics we impute to them.

9\. Those who do not understand

The distinction drawn between these two truths

Do not understand

The Buddha's profound truth.

10\. Without a foundation in the conventional[]{#calibre_link-2162}
truth,

The significance of the ultimate cannot be taught.

Without understanding the significance of the ultimate,

Liberation is not achieved.

The goal of Mādhyamika philosophy is liberation from suffering. But that
liberation, on Nāgārjuna's view, can only be achieved by insight into
the ultimate nature[]{#calibre_link-2163} of things---their
emptiness---and indeed into the ultimate nature of emptiness, which we
shall see to be emptiness again. But this insight can only be gained
through reasoning and hence through language and thought. And the truth
that is to be grasped can only be indicated through language and
thought, which are thoroughly conventional and which can only be
interpreted literally at the conventional[]{#calibre_link-2164} level.
It is important to see here []{#calibre_link-386}that Nāgārjuna is not
disparaging the conventional by contrast to the ultimate, but is arguing
that understanding the ultimate nature of things is completely dependent
upon understanding conventional truth. This is true in several senses:
First, as we shall see, understanding the ultimate nature of
things[]{#calibre_link-2165} just is understanding that their
conventional nature *is merely conventional.* But second, and perhaps
less obscurely, in order to explain emptiness---the ultimate nature of
all phenomena---one must use words and concepts and explain such things
as interdependence, impermanence, and so forth. And all of these are
conventional phenomena. So both in the end, where the understanding of
ultimate truth is[]{#calibre_link-2166} in an important sense the
understanding of the nature of the conventional, and on the path, where
the cultivation of such understanding requires the use of conventions,
conventional truth must be affirmed and
understood.[]{#calibre_link-745}[^110^](#calibre_link-234){.nounder}

11\. By a misperception of emptiness

A person of little intelligence is destroyed.

Like a snake incorrectly seized

Or like a spell incorrectly cast.

[]{#calibre_link-296}The Mā[]{#calibre_link-2167}dhyamika doctrine of
emptiness is subtle and is easily misinterpreted. In particular, it is
often misinterpreted as a thoroughgoing nihilism about phenomena. This
is so not only among classical Indian critics of Mādhyamika, in both
Buddhist and non-Buddhist philosophical schools, but also among Western
critics, who have sometimes regarded it as completely
negative.[]{#calibre_link-747}[^111^](#calibre_link-235){.nounder}[]{#calibre_link-2168}
In this respect, Mādhyamika philosophy has suffered from the same fate
as much Western sceptical philosophy, including that of the Pyrrhonians
and of Hume and Wittgenstein, all of whom were at considerable pains to
warn readers against interpreting them as denying the existence of
ordinary entities, but all of whom have been repeatedly read as doing
so. Nā[]{#calibre_link-2169}gārjuna is here charging the opponent
represented in the opening verses with interpreting the assertion that a
phenomenon is empty as the assertion that it is nonexistent. Nothing,
Nāgārjuna will argue, could be further from the
truth.[]{#calibre_link-748}[^112^](#calibre_link-236){.nounder}

[]{#calibre_link-433}12. For that reason---that the Dharma is

Deep and difficult to understand[]{#calibre_link-2170} and to learn---

The Buddha's mind despaired of

Being able to teach it.

13\. You have presented fallacious refutations

That are not relevant to emptiness.

Your confusion about emptiness

Does not belong to me.

Nāgārjuna here simply denies that his view sustains the nihilistic
reading, while granting that if one treats emptiness as
nonexistence,[]{#calibre_link-2171} all of the absurd conclusions that
the opponent enumerates indeed follow. But, Nāgārjuna continues in XXIV:
14, the interpretation of the entire Mādhyamika system depends directly
on how one understands the concept of emptiness. If that is understood
correctly, everything else falls into place. If it is
misunderstood,[]{#calibre_link-2172} nothing in the system makes any
sense:

14\. For him to whom emptiness is clear,

Everything becomes clear.

For him to whom emptiness is not clear,

Nothing becomes
clear.[]{#calibre_link-750}[^113^](#calibre_link-237){.nounder}

15\. When you foist on us

All of your errors

You are like a man who has mounted his horse

And has forgotten that very horse.

Here is the idea behind this image, a standard trope in classical Indian
rhetoric: A man with[]{#calibre_link-2173} a herd of horses thinks that
he is missing one and accuses you of having stolen it. As he rides
around and counts his horses, he always comes up one short. But you
point out to him that the one he is accusing you of stealing is in fact
the very one he is riding but has forgotten to count. Likewise,
Nāgārjuna is saying, the opponent who[]{#calibre_link-2174} confuses the
Mādhyamika []{#calibre_link-411}analysis in terms of emptiness with
nihilism is charging Nāgārjuna with a nihilism that is in fact his own.
Nāgārjuna will argue, that is, that while the opponent claims to
preserve the reality of the three jewels, the Four[]{#calibre_link-2175}
Noble Truths, and dependently arisen phenomena against Nāgārjuna's
nihilism, Nāgārjuna himself can explain the reality of these things,
though it will turn out that on the opponent's view they must be
nonexistent\![]{#calibre_link-752}[^114^](#calibre_link-238){.nounder}
At this point the positive philosophical program of this
chapter[]{#calibre_link-2176} begins.

16\. If you perceive the existence of all things

In terms of their essence,

Then this perception of all things

Will be without the perception of causes and conditions.

There are two related assertions contained in this critical verse:
First, at the conventional level, the opponent, in virtue of thinking
that to exist is to exist inherently, will be unable to account for
dependent arising[]{#calibre_link-2177} and hence for anything that must
be dependently arisen. As Nāgārjuna will make explicit later on, this
will include such things as suffering, its causes, nirvāṇa, the path
thereto, the Dharma, the Sangha, and the Buddha, as well as more mundane
phenomena.

But secondly and more subtly, since[]{#calibre_link-2178} the opponent
is seeing actual existence as existence as a discrete entity with an
essence, it would follow that for the opponent the reality of emptiness
would []{#calibre_link-2179}entail that emptiness itself is an entity,
an inherently existing entity at that. To see emptiness in this way is
to see it as radically different from conventional, phenomenal reality.
It is to see the conventional as illusory and
emptiness[]{#calibre_link-2180} as the reality standing behind it. If
Nāgārjuna were to adopt this view of emptiness, he would indeed have to
deny the reality of the entire phenomenal, conventional world. This
would also be to ascribe a special, nonconventional, nondependent
hyperreality to emptiness itself. Ordinary things would be viewed as
nonexistent, emptiness[]{#calibre_link-2181} as substantially existent.
(It is important and central to the Mādhyamika dialectic to see that
these go together---that nihilism about one kind of entity is typically
paired with reification of another.) This view is not uncommon in
Buddhist philosophy, and Nāgārjuna is clearly aware that it might be
suggested[]{#calibre_link-2182} by his own position. So Nāgārjuna's
reply must begin by distancing himself from this reified view of
emptiness itself and hence from the dualism it entails. Only then can he
show that to reify emptiness in this way would indeed entail the
difficulties his imaginary opponent adumbrates, difficulties not
attaching to Nā[]{#calibre_link-2183}gārjuna's own
view.[]{#calibre_link-754}[^115^](#calibre_link-239){.nounder} This
brings us to the central verses of this chapter:

17\. Effects and causes

And agent and action

And conditions and arising and ceasing

And effects will be rendered impossible.

Again, this verse is to be read at two levels: At the conventional
level, the opponent, through reifying phenomena in order to preserve
their conventional reality,[]{#calibre_link-2184} will deny the
possibility of any []{#calibre_link-372}kind of dependence,
impermanence, or action. But more importantly, if Nāgārjuna's analysis
of these things as empty meant that they were nonexistent and that only
emptiness exists, then Nāgārjuna himself would be denying the empirical
reality[]{#calibre_link-2185} of these phenomena. That is, not only
would an inherently existent phenomenal world be devoid of change,
dependency, and so forth, but inherently existent emptiness would render
the phenomenal world completely nonexistent.

This defines the straits between which the middle path must be found, as
well as the presupposition that generates both extremes: The extreme of
reification of the phenomenal[]{#calibre_link-2186} world depends upon
viewing emptiness nihilistically; the extreme of reification of
emptiness requires us to be nihilistic about the phenomenal world. A
middle path must reify neither and hence must regard emptiness, as well
as all empty phenomena, as empty. Both extremes presuppose that to exist
is to exist inherently. They only disagree about whether this inherent
existence is properly ascribed[]{#calibre_link-2187} to conventional
phenomena or to their ultimate nature. Nāgārjuna will deny exactly that
presupposition, arguing that to exist is to exist conventionally and
that both conventional phenomena and their ultimate natures exist in
exactly that way. The next verse is the climax of the entire text and
can truly be said to contain the entire Mā[]{#calibre_link-2188}dhyamika
system in embryo. It is perhaps the most often quoted and extensively
commented on verse in all of Mahāyāna philosophy:

18\. Whatever is dependently co-arisen

That is explained to be emptiness.

That, being a dependent designation,

Is itself the middle way.

19\. Something that is not dependently arisen,

Such a thing does not[]{#calibre_link-2189} exist.

Therefore a nonempty thing

Does not exist.

These two verses demand careful scrutiny and are best discussed
together. In XXIV: 18, Nāgārjuna establishes a critical three-way
relation between emptiness, dependent origination and verbal convention,
and asserts that this relation itself is the Middle Way toward which his
entire[]{#calibre_link-2190} philosophical system is aimed. As we shall
[]{#calibre_link-315}see, this is the basis for understanding the
emptiness of emptiness itself. Nāgārjuna is asserting that the
dependently arisen is emptiness. Emptiness and the phenomenal world are
not two distinct things. They are, rather, two characterizations of the
same thing. To say of something that it is[]{#calibre_link-2191}
dependently co-arisen is to say that it is empty. To say of something
that it is empty is another way of saying that it arises
dependently.[]{#calibre_link-756}[^116^](#calibre_link-240){.nounder}

Moreover, whatever is dependently co-arisen is verbally established.
That is, the identity of any dependently arisen thing depends upon
verbal conventions. To say of a thing that it is dependently arisen is
to say that its identity as a single entity is[]{#calibre_link-2192}
nothing more than its being the referent of a word. The thing itself,
apart from conventions of individuation, has no identity. To say of a
thing that its identity is a merely verbal fact about it is to say that
it is empty. To view emptiness in this way is to see it neither as an
entity nor as unreal---it is to see it as conventionally
real.[]{#calibre_link-757}[^117^](#calibre_link-241){.nounder}

Moreover, "emptiness" itself is asserted to be a[]{#calibre_link-2193}
dependent designation (Tib: *brten nas gdags-pa,*Skt:
*prajñaptir-upādāya,*).[]{#calibre_link-758}[^118^](#calibre_link-242){.nounder}
Its referent, emptiness itself, is thereby asserted to be merely
dependent and nominal---conventionally existent but ultimately empty.
This is hence a middle path with regard to
emptiness.[]{#calibre_link-759}[^119^](#calibre_link-243){.nounder} To
view []{#calibre_link-504}the dependently originated world in this way
is to see it neither[]{#calibre_link-2194} as nonempty nor as completely
nonexistent. It is, viewed in this way, conventionally existent, but
empty. So we have a middle path with regard to dependent
origination.[]{#calibre_link-761}[^120^](#calibre_link-244){.nounder} To
view convention in this way []{#calibre_link-337}is to view it neither
as ontologically insignificant---it determines the character of the
phenomenal world---nor as ontologically efficacious---it is empty. And
so we also have a middle way with regard[]{#calibre_link-2195} to
convention. Finally, given the nice ambiguity in the reference of
"that," *(de ni),*not only are "dependent arising" and "emptiness"
asserted to be dependent designations, and their referents hence merely
nominal, but the very relation between them is asserted to be so
dependent and hence to be empty.

This last fact, the emptiness of the relation between the conventional
world of dependently[]{#calibre_link-2196} arisen phenomena and
emptiness itself, is of extreme importance at another stage of the
Mādhyamika dialectic and comes to salience in Nāgārjuna's *Vigrahavy*ā
*vartan*ī´´ and in Candrakīrti's *Prasannapad*ā *.*For this amounts to
the emptiness of the central[]{#calibre_link-2197} ontological tenet of
Nāgārjuna's system and is what allows him to claim, despite all
appearances, that he is positionless. That is, Nāgārjuna thereby has a
ready reply to the following apparent reductio argument (reminiscent of
classical Greek and subsequent Western challenges[]{#calibre_link-2198}
to Pyrrhonian scepticism): You say that all things are, from the
ultimate standpoint, nonexistent. That must then apply to your own
thesis. It therefore is really nonexistent, and your words, only
nominally true. Your own thesis, therefore, denies its own ground and is
self-defeating. This objection would be a sound one against a view that
in fact asserted its own inherent existence, or
grounded[]{#calibre_link-2199} its truth on an inherently existing
ontological basis. But, Nāgārjuna suggests here, that is not the case
for his account. Rather everything, including this very thesis, has only
nominal truth, and nothing is either inherently existent or true in
virtue of designating an inherently existent fact. This is hence one
more point at which[]{#calibre_link-2200} ladders must be kicked
away.[]{#calibre_link-763}[^121^](#calibre_link-245){.nounder}

These morals are driven home in XXIV: 19, where Nāgārjuna emphasizes
that everything---and this must include emptiness---is
[]{#calibre_link-529}dependently arisen. So everything---including
emptiness---lacks inherent existence. So nothing lacks the three
coextensive properties of emptiness, dependent-origination, and
conventional[]{#calibre_link-2201} identity.

With this in hand, Nāgārjuna can reply to the critic: He points out
(XXIV: 20-35) that, in virtue of the identity of dependent origination
and emptiness on the one hand and of ontological independence and
intrinsic reality on the other, such phenomena as arising, ceasing,
suffering, change, enlightenment, and so on---the
very[]{#calibre_link-2202} phenomena the opponent charges Nāgārjuna with
denying---are possible only if they are empty. The tables are thus
turned: It appeared that Nāgārjuna, in virtue of arguing for the
emptiness of these phenomena, was arguing that in reality they do not
exist precisely because for the[]{#calibre_link-2203} reifier of
emptiness, existence and emptiness are opposites. But, in fact, because
of the identity of emptiness and conventional existence, it is the
reifier who, in virtue of denying the emptiness of these phenomena,
denies their existence. And it is hence the reifier of emptiness who is
impaled on *both*horns of the dilemma he presented to
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2204}rjuna: Contradicting the ultimate truth, the
opponent denies that these phenomena are empty; contradicting the
conventional, he is forced to deny that they even exist! And so
Nāgārjuna can conclude:

20\. If all this were nonempty, as in your view,

There would be no arising and ceasing.

Then the Four Noble Truths

Would become nonexistent.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2205}
:::

The argument for this surprising turnabout reductio is straightforwardly
presented in the subsequent verses:

21\. If it is not dependently arisen,

How could suffering come to be?

Suffering has been taught to be impermanent,

And so cannot come from its own essence.

The first noble truth is the truth of the existence of suffering. The
opponent charges Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2206}rjuna with denying the
existence of suffering through asserting its emptiness. But, Nāgārjuna
points out, since emptiness is dependent origination, when the opponent
[]{#calibre_link-416}denies its emptiness, he denies that suffering is
dependently originated. But he agrees that all phenomena are dependently
originated. He thus is forced to deny the
existence[]{#calibre_link-2207} of suffering. But for Nāgārjuna, since
existence amounts to emptiness, the assertion of the emptiness of
suffering affirms, rather than denies, its existence.

22\. If something comes from its own essence,

How could it ever be arisen?

It follows that if one denies emptiness

There can be no arising (of suffering).

The second noble truth[]{#calibre_link-2208} is that suffering has a
cause. But, again, if the opponent asserts the nonemptiness of
suffering, he asserts that it does not arise from causes and conditions.
Yet Nāgārjuna's analysis shows that it must, in virtue of its emptiness,
be so arisen and thus accords with the second truth.

23\. If suffering had an essence,

Its cessation would[]{#calibre_link-2209} not exist.

So if an essence is posited,

One denies cessation.

Similarly, the third noble truth is the truth of cessation. But
inherently existent things cannot cease. Empty ones can. Nāgārjuna's
analysis thus explains the third truth; the reifier contradicts it.

24\. If the path had an essence,

Cultivation would not be appropriate.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2210}
:::

If this path is indeed cultivated,

It cannot have an essence.

25\. If suffering, arising, and

Ceasing are nonexistent,

By what path could one seek

To obtain the cessation of suffering?

The fourth truth is the truth of the path. Again, the path only makes
sense, and cultivation of the path is only possible, if suffering
[]{#calibre_link-318}is impermanent and alleviable and if the nature of
mind is empty and hence[]{#calibre_link-2211} malleable. The path, after
all, is a path from suffering and to awakening. If the former cannot
cease and the latter does not depend on cultivation, the path is
nonexistent. But it is the analysis in terms of emptiness that makes
this coherent. An analysis on which either the phenomena were inherently
existent or on which emptiness was and the phenomena were therefore
nonexistent would make nonsense[]{#calibre_link-2212} of the Four Noble
Truths. Nāgārjuna now turns to the implications for this line of
argument for the three jewels, the Sangha, the Buddha, and the Dharma:

26\. If nonunderstanding comes to be

Through its essence,

How will understanding arise?

Isn't essence stable?

If ignorance is real and thus for the opponent inherently
existent,[]{#calibre_link-2213} there is no possibility of replacing it
with insight. Therefore the cultivation of Buddhist practice is
impossible, or at least pointless.

27\. In the same way, the activities of

Relinquishing, realizing, and meditating

And the four fruits

Would not be possible.

28\. For an essentialist,

Since the fruits through their essence

Are already unrealized,

In what way could one attain them?

So[]{#calibre_link-2214} the essentialist has a dilemma if he wants to
maintain the possibility of a community of practicioners (the Sangha)
and of a path for them to practice: Either the ignorance in which they
find themselves and that serves as the impetus to practice is inherently
existent, in which case practice is bound to be inefficacious, or the
understanding they hope to achieve is inherently existent, in which
case[]{#calibre_link-2215} there is no need to practice since it is
already present and no use in practicing since its existence is
independent of practice.

[]{#calibre_link-2216}29. Without the fruits, there are no attainers of
the fruits,

Or enterers. From this it follows that

The eight kinds of persons do not exist.

If these don't exist, there is no spiritual community.

The consequence of this is that there is no Sangha. The
existence[]{#calibre_link-2217} of the Sangha is entirely dependent upon
the existence of the path and of the possibility of the fruits of the
path---increasing degrees of realization since the Sangha is, by
definition, the community of practicioners of the path.

30\. From the nonexistence of the Noble Truths

Would follow the nonexistence of the true doctrine.

If there is no doctrine and no spiritual community,

How could a[]{#calibre_link-2218} Buddha arise?

But it would also follow that there is no Dharma---no true Buddhist
doctrine since that is grounded on the existence of the Four Noble
Truths. And finally, as Nāgārjuna emphasizes in XXIV: 31, 32, since the
attainment of buddhahood depends upon the study and practice of the
Dharma within the context of the spiritual
community,[]{#calibre_link-2219} the opponent's view, unlike
Nāgārjuna's, has the consequence that no buddha can arise. Moreover, if
the Buddha and enlightenment were each inherently existent, they would
be independent and could hence arise independently, which is absurd. To
be a buddha is to be enlightened, and vice versa:

31\. For you, it would follow that a Buddha

[]{#calibre_link-2220}Arises independent of enlightenment.

And for you, enlightenment would arise

Independent of a Buddha.

32\. For you, one who through his essence

Was unenlightened,

Even by practicing the path to enlightenment

Could not achieve enlightenment.

Nāgārjuna has hence demonstrated that any reification, whether of the
conventional or of the[]{#calibre_link-2221} ultimate, ends up,
paradoxically, denying the existence of the very things it reifies. And
any []{#calibre_link-273}reification renders the most fundamental
Buddhist philosophical insights and practices incoherent. A
thoroughgoing analysis in terms of emptiness, on the other hand---one
that includes the understanding of the emptiness of emptiness---renders
the entire phenomenal world as well as emptiness itself
comprehensible[]{#calibre_link-2222} as nominally existent, empirically
actual, and dependently arisen---real but essenceless. At this stage,
Nāgārjuna shifts to the charge leveled by the opponent in XXIV: 2 that
no practice is intelligible in the context of emptiness and argues that,
on the contrary, practice is intelligible only in that context. The
argument is a reprise[]{#calibre_link-2223} of earlier moves, and so is
rather straightforward:

33\. Moreover, one could never perform

Right or wrong actions.

If this were all nonempty what could one do?

That with an essence cannot be produced.

Nāgārjuna now turns to the moral dimensions of the extreme positions and
their consequences for the Buddhist doctrine of karma,
specifically[]{#calibre_link-2224} with regard to the consequences for
one's own life of one's actions. Nonempty phenomena, such as the
opponent wishes to posit, are seen, on analysis, to be static. But
practice and action require dependence, change, and a regular relation
between one's actions and one's future state. So in the preceding verse,
Nāgārjuna notes that in[]{#calibre_link-2225} a static, nonempty world,
we can't even make sense of the possibility of action. He then points
out (XXIV: 34) that even were action possible, in virtue of the
impossibility of change and dependence in an essentialist universe,
there would be no consequences of those actions. For to be a consequence
is to be dependent, hence to be empty, hence from the standpoint of the
essentialist---whether reificationist[]{#calibre_link-2226} or
nihilist---nonexistent.

34\. For you, from neither right nor wrong actions

Would the fruit arise.

If the fruit arose from right or wrong actions,

According to you, it wouldn't exist.

35\. If, for you, a fruit arose

From right or wrong actions,

[]{#calibre_link-373}Then, having arisen from right or wrong actions

How could that fruit be nonempty?

The reificationist develops a strict dichotomy between
things[]{#calibre_link-2227} that exist inherently and things that are
completely nonexistent. That dichotomy exhausts the ontological domain.
But neither possibility for understanding the nature of practice, the
practicioner, or the fruits of practice makes sense of action. If the
relevant phenomena are granted inherent existence, their essence
precludes development and change. If, on the other hand, they lack
essence and hence,[]{#calibre_link-2228} for the reifier, are completely
nonexistent, there literally is no practice, in any sense. But if they
are conceived of as empty and hence empirically and conventionally real,
yet essenceless and dependent, the possibility and purpose of practice
fall out straightforwardly. So it is the reifier, not Nāgārjuna, who
makes action and soteriology[]{#calibre_link-2229} impossible, and
Nāgārjuna and not the reifier who rescue them from ontological oblivion.

36\. If dependent arising is denied,

Emptiness itself is rejected.

This would contradict

All of the worldly conventions.

Recall the other horn of the dilemma in XXIV: 6. The opponent charged
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2230}rjuna not only with contradicting fundamental
Buddhist tenets, but with contradicting the conventional truth as well.
Nāgārjuna has responded up to this point to the first charge, turning it
back on the opponent. He now does the same with the second.

Nāgārjuna suggests that to[]{#calibre_link-2231} assert the nonemptiness
of phenomena and of their interrelations when emptiness is properly
understood is not only philosophically deeply confused, but is
contradictory to common sense. We can make sense of this argument in the
following way: Common sense neither posits nor requires intrinsic
reality in phenomena or a real causal nexus. Common sense holds the
world to be a network of dependently[]{#calibre_link-2232} arisen
phenomena. So common sense only makes sense if the world is asserted to
be empty. Hence it is the opponent, not Nāgārjuna, who disagrees with
the conventional truth.

[]{#calibre_link-309}The standpoint of emptiness is hence not at odds
with the conventional standpoint, only with a particular philosophical
understanding of it---that which takes the
conventional[]{#calibre_link-2233} to be more than merely conventional.
What is curious---and, from the Buddhist standpoint, sad---about the
human condition, on this view, is the naturalness and seductiveness of
that philosophical
perspective.[]{#calibre_link-765}[^122^](#calibre_link-246){.nounder}

This, of course, is the key to the soteriological character of the text:
Reification is the root of grasping and craving and hence of all
suffering. And it is perfectly natural, despite
its[]{#calibre_link-2234} incoherence. By understanding emptiness,
Nāgārjuna intends one to break this habit and extirpate the root of
suffering. But if in doing so one falls into the abyss of nihilism,
nothing is achieved. For then action itself is impossible and senseless,
and one's realization amounts to nothing. Or again, if one relinquishes
the reification[]{#calibre_link-2235} of phenomena but reifies
emptiness, that issues in a new grasping and craving---the grasping of
emptiness and the craving for Nirvāna---and a new round of suffering.
Only with the simultaneous realization of the emptiness, but
conventional reality, of phenomena and of the emptiness of emptiness,
argues Nāgārjuna,[]{#calibre_link-2236} can suffering be wholly
uprooted.

Let us consider now more carefully what it is to say that emptiness
itself is empty. The claim, even in the context of Buddhist philosophy,
does have a somewhat paradoxical air. For emptiness is, in Mahāyāna
philosophical thought, the ultimate nature of all phenomena. And the
distinction between the[]{#calibre_link-2237} merely conventional nature
of things and their ultimate nature would seem to mark the distinction
between the apparent and the real. While it is plausible to say that
what is merely apparent is empty of reality, it seems
[]{#calibre_link-440}nihilistic to say that what is ultimately real is
empty of reality, and as we have seen, the Mādhyamika are quite
consciously antinihilistic. But[]{#calibre_link-2238} again, when we say
that a phenomenon is empty, we say, inter alia, that it is
impermanent,[]{#calibre_link-767}[^123^](#calibre_link-247){.nounder}
that it depends upon conditions and that its identity is dependent upon
convention. Do we really want to say of each phenomenon that its
emptiness---the fact that it is empty---is itself impermanent; itself
dependent on something else; itself dependent upon conventions? It might
at least appear that even[]{#calibre_link-2239} if all other properties
of conventional entities were so, their emptiness would be an eternal,
independent, essential fact.

It may be useful to approach the emptiness of emptiness by first asking
what it would be to treat emptiness as nonempty. When we say that a
phenomenon is empty, we mean that when we try to specify its essence, we
come up with nothing. When we look for the substance
that[]{#calibre_link-2240} underlies the properties, or the bearer of
the parts, we find none. When we ask what it is that gives a thing its
identity, we stumble not upon ontological facts but upon conventions.
For a thing to be nonempty would be for it to have an essence
discoverable upon analysis, for it to be a substance independent of its
attributes, or a bearer of parts, for its identity to be self-determined
by its essence.[]{#calibre_link-2241} A nonempty entity can be fully
characterized nonrelationally.

For emptiness to be nonempty would be for it to be a substantial entity,
an independent existent, a nonconventional phenomenon. On such a view,
emptiness would be entirely distinct from any conventional phenomenon.
It would, on such a view, be the object of correct perception, while
conventional phenomena would be []{#calibre_link-2242}the objects of
delusive[]{#calibre_link-2243} perception. While conventional phenomena
would be dependent upon conventions, conditions, or the ignorance of
obstructed minds, emptiness, on such a view, would be apparent precisely
when one sees through those conventions, dispels that ignorance, and
overcomes those obstructions. Though such a position might appear
metaphysically extravagant, it is hardly unmotivated. For one thing, it
seems[]{#calibre_link-2244} that emptiness does have an identifiable
essence---namely the lack of inherent existence. So if to be empty is to
be empty of essence, emptiness fails on that count to be empty.
Moreover, since all phenomena, on the Mādhyamika view, are empty,
emptiness would appear to be eternal and independent of any particular
conventions and, hence, not dependently arisen. The
two[]{#calibre_link-2245} truths, on such an ontological vision, are
indeed radically distinct from one another.

But this position is, from Nāgārjuna's perspective, untenable. The best
way to see that is this: Suppose that we take a conventional entity,
such as a table. We analyze it to demonstrate its emptiness, finding
that there is no table apart from its[]{#calibre_link-2246} parts, that
it cannot be distinguished in a principled way from its antecedent and
subsequent histories, and so forth. So we conclude that it is empty. But
now let us analyze that emptiness---the emptiness of the table---to see
what we find. What do we find? Nothing at all but *the table's*lack of
inherent existence. No conventional table, no emptiness of the table.
The emptiness is dependent upon the[]{#calibre_link-2247} table and is,
therefore, itself empty of inherent existence, as is the emptiness of
*that*emptiness, and so on, ad infinitum. To see the table as empty, for
Nāgārjuna, is not to somehow see "beyond" the illusion of the table to
some other, more real entity. It is to see the table *as conventional;
as dependent.*But the table that we see when[]{#calibre_link-2248} we
see its emptiness is the very same table, seen not as the substantial
thing we instinctively posit, but rather as it is. Emptiness is hence
not different from conventional reality---it is the fact that
conventional reality is conventional. Hence it must be dependently
arisen since it depends upon the existence of empty phenomena. Hence
emptiness itself is empty. This is perhaps the most
radical[]{#calibre_link-2249} and deep step in the Mādhyamika dialectic,
but it is also, as we shall see, the step that saves it from falling
[]{#calibre_link-396}into metaphysical extravagance and brings it back
to sober pragmatic
scepticism.[]{#calibre_link-769}[^124^](#calibre_link-248){.nounder}

37\. If emptiness itself is rejected,

No action will be appropriate.

There would be action which did not begin,

And there would be agent without action.

Without viewing[]{#calibre_link-2250} the world as empty, we can make no
sense of any human activity. Action would be pointless since nothing
could be accomplished. Any existent action would have to have been
eternal, and anyone who is an agent would be so independently of any
action since agency would be an essential attribute.

38\. If there is essence, the whole world

Will be unarising, unceasing,

And static. The entire phenomenal[]{#calibre_link-2251} world

Would be immutable.

Without viewing the world as empty, we can make no sense of impermanence
or dependent origination and hence no sense of change.

39\. If it (the world) were not empty,

Then action would be without profit.

The act of ending suffering and

Abandoning misery and defilement would not exist.

Perhaps most important from the standpoint of Buddhist phenomenology
and, though[]{#calibre_link-2252} not hard to see, easy to overlook: We
are driven to reify ourselves, the objects in the world around us,
and---in more abstract philosophical moods---theoretical constructs,
values, and so on because of an instinctual feeling that without an
intrinsically real self, an intrinsically real world, and intrinsically
real values, life has no real meaning and is utterly hopeless.
Nā[]{#calibre_link-2253}gārjuna emphasizes at the close of this chapter
that this gets []{#calibre_link-274}things exactly backward: If we
seriously and carefully examine what such a reified world would be like,
it would indeed be hopeless. But if instead we treat ourselves, others,
and our values as empty, there is hope and a purpose to life. For then,
in the context of impermanence and dependence, human
action[]{#calibre_link-2254} and knowledge make sense, and moral and
spiritual progress become possible. It is only in the context of
*ultimate* *nonexistence*that *actual existence*makes any sense at all.

40\. Whoever sees dependent arising

Also sees suffering

And its arising

And its cessation as well as the path.

Nāgārjuna closes as he opens, with the Four Noble[]{#calibre_link-2255}
Truths, this time connecting them not negatively, as in the beginning,
to emptiness, but positively, to dependent arising. Understanding the
nature of dependent arising is itself understanding emptiness and is
itself the understanding of the Four Noble Truths.

It is absolutely critical to understanding the dialectical structure not
only of this chapter but of the entire text to see that
this[]{#calibre_link-2256} doctrine of the emptiness of emptiness that
is the central thesis of Mādhyamika philosophy emerges directly from
XXIV: 18. For the emptiness of emptiness, as we have just seen, simply
amounts to the identification of emptiness with the property of being
dependently arisen and with the property of having an identity just in
virtue of conventional, verbal designation.[]{#calibre_link-2257} It is
the fact that emptiness is no more than this that makes it empty, just
as it is the fact that conventional phenomena in general are no more
than conventional and no more than their parts and status in the causal
nexus that makes them empty.

Paradox may appear to loom at this point. For, one might argue, if
emptiness is empty, and to be empty is to be merely conventional, then
the emptiness[]{#calibre_link-2258} of any phenomenon is a merely
conventional fact. Moreover, to say that entities are merely
conventional is merely conventional. Hence it would appear optional, as
all conventions are. Hence it would seem to be open to say that things
are in fact nonconventional and therefore nonempty. This would
[]{#calibre_link-374}be a deep incoherence indeed at the heart of
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2259}rjuna's system. But the paradox is merely
apparent. The appearance of paradox derives from seeing "conventional"
as functioning logically like a negation operator---a subtle version of
the nihilistic reading Nāgārjuna is at pains to avoid, with a
metalinguistic twist. For then, each iteration of "conventional" would
cancel the previous occurrence,[]{#calibre_link-2260} and the
conventional character of the fact that things are conventional would
amount to the claim that really they are not, or at least that they
might not be. But in Nāgārjuna's philosophical approach, the sense of
the term is more ontological than logical: To say of a phenomenon or of
a fact that it is conventional is to characterize[]{#calibre_link-2261}
its mode of subsistence. It is to say that it is without an independent
nature. The fact that a phenomenon is without independent nature is, to
be sure, a further phenomenon---a higher order fact. But that fact, too,
is without an independent nature. It, too, is merely conventional. This
is another way of putting the strongly nominalistic character of
Mādhyamika philosophy.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2262}
:::

So a Platonist, for instance, might urge (and the Mādhyamika would
agree) that a perceptible phenomenon is ultimately unreal. But the
Platonist would assert that its properties are ultimately real. And if
some Buddhist-influenced Platonist would note that among the properties
of a perceptible phenomenon is its emptiness and its conventional
reality, s/he would assert[]{#calibre_link-2263} that these, as
properties, are ultimately real. This is exactly where Nāgārjuna parts
company with all forms of realism. For he gives the properties a
nominalistic construal and asserts that they, including the properties
of emptiness and conventionality, are, like all phenomena, merely
nominal, merely empty, and merely conventional.[]{#calibre_link-2264}
And so on for their emptiness and conventionality. The nominalism
undercuts the negative interpretation of "conventional" and thereby
renders the regress harmless.

So the doctrine of the emptiness of emptiness can be seen as
inextricably linked with Nāgārjuna's distinctive account of the relation
between the two truths. For Nā[]{#calibre_link-2265}gārjuna, as is also
evident in this crucial verse, it is a mistake to distinguish
conventional from ultimate reality---the dependently arisen from
emptiness---at an ontological level. Emptiness just is the emptiness of
conventional phenomena. To perceive conventional phenomena as empty is
just []{#calibre_link-2266}to see them as conventional and as
dependently arisen. The difference---such as[]{#calibre_link-2267} it
is---between the conventional and the ultimate is a difference in the
way phenomena are conceived/perceived. The point must be formulated with
some delicacy and cannot be formulated without a hint of the paradoxical
about it: Conventional phenomena are typically represented as inherently
existent. We typically perceive and conceive of external phenomena,
ourselves, causal powers, moral truths,[]{#calibre_link-2268} and so
forth as independently existing, intrinsically identifiable, and
substantial. But though this is, in one sense, the conventional
character of conventional phenomena---the manner in which they are
ordinarily experienced---to see them this way is precisely not to see
them *as conventional.*To see that they are merely conventional, in the
sense adumbrated above and defended by Nā[]{#calibre_link-2269}gārjuna
and his followers, is thereby to see them as empty, and this is their
ultimate mode of existence. These are the two truths about phenomena: On
the one hand, they are conventionally existent and the things we
ordinarily say about them are in fact true, to the extent that we get it
right on the terms of the everyday. Snow is indeed white, and there are
indeed[]{#calibre_link-2270} tables and chairs in this room. On the
other hand, they are ultimately nonexistent. These two truths seem as
different as night and day---being and nonbeing. But the import of this
chapter and the doctrine we have been explicating is that their ultimate
nonexistence and their conventional existence are the same thing. Hence
the deep identity of the two truths. And this is because emptiness is
not other[]{#calibre_link-2271} than dependent arising and, hence,
because emptiness is empty.

Finally, at this stage we can see why Chapter I opens the text. The
discussion of the emptiness of conditions and their relation to their
effects is not only essential groundwork for this central argument, but
in fact anticipates it and brings its conclusion to bear implicitly on
the whole remainder of the text, allowing us, once[]{#calibre_link-2272}
we see that, to read the entire text as asserting not only the emptiness
of phenomena, but that emptiness understood as empty. To see this, note
that this entire account depends upon the emptiness of dependent
origination itself. Suppose for a moment that one had the view that
dependent arising were nonempty (not a crazy view and not
*obviously*incompatible with, and arguably entailed by,
[]{#calibre_link-2273}certain[]{#calibre_link-2274} Buddhist doctrines).
Then from the identification of emptiness with dependent arising would
follow the nonemptiness of emptiness. Moreover, if conventional
phenomena are empty, and dependent arising itself is nonempty and is
identified with emptiness, then the two truths are indeed two in every
sense. Emptiness-dependent arising is self-existent, while ordinary
phenomena are not, and one gets a[]{#calibre_link-2275} strongly
dualistic, ontological version of an appearance-reality distinction. So
the argument for the emptiness of emptiness in Chapter XXIV and the
identity of the two truths with which it is bound up depend critically
on the argument for the emptiness of dependent origination developed in
Chapter I.

Having developed this surprising and deep thesis regarding the identity
of the two truths, Nā[]{#calibre_link-2276}gārjuna turns in the next
chapter to the nature of the relation between saṃsāra and nirvāna and
the nature of nirvāna itself.

## **[]{#calibre_link-514 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-64 .calibre4}Chapter XXV  Examination of Nirvāṇa** {#chapter-xxv-examination-of-nirvāṇa-1 .h1}

This chapter continues the study of the nature of what are often thought
of as ultimate realities and that of their relation to the conventional
world. It follows quite naturally on the preceding chapter, which
considered the relation between emptiness and the conventional world.
For insight into emptiness is,[]{#calibre_link-2279} from the standpoint
of Mādhyamika philosophy, an important precondition for entry into
nirvāṇa. And just as the ultimate truth is related to the conventional
as an understanding of the way things really are as opposed to the way
they appear to be, nirvāṇa is related to saṃ[]{#calibre_link-2280}sāra
as a state of awareness of things as they are as opposed to a state of
awareness of things as they appear to be. But given the results of
Chapter XXIV, and the surprising identification in entity of the
conventional with the ultimate and the doctrine of the emptiness of
emptiness, one might well wonder about the status of
nirvāṇ[]{#calibre_link-2281}a. Is it no different from saṃsāra? If it
is, how, and how is it related to saṃsāra? If not, why pursue it, or
better, why aren't we already there? Is nirvāṇa empty? If not, how does
it escape the Mādhyamika dialectic? If it[]{#calibre_link-2282} is, can
it really be different from saṃsāra?

Nāgārjuna begins the examination with a challenge from the
reificationist, raised by the previous chapter:

1\. If all this is empty.

Then there is no arising or passing away.

[]{#calibre_link-515}By the relinquishing or ceasing of what

Does one wish nirvā[]{#calibre_link-2283}ṇa to arise?

Nirvāṇa is defined as a state one achieves when delusion and grasping
cease, and when one relinquishes saṃsāra and its entities. But if there
is neither self, nor object, nor delusion, nor grasping, who
relinquishes what, and in what manner? Moreover, if there is no
arising[]{#calibre_link-2284} or passing away from the ultimate point of
view, how can nirvāṇa arise or saṃsāra pass away? Nāgārjuna replies,
using the same dialectical strategy deployed in the previous chapter:

2\. If all this is nonempty,

Then there is no arising or[]{#calibre_link-2285} passing away.

By the relinquishing or ceasing of what

Does one wish nirvāṇa to arise?

Nirvāṇa would be precluded not by the emptiness of saṃsāra, but rather
by its inherent existence. For then it could not pass away. Nor could an
inherently grasping[]{#calibre_link-2286} grasper relinquish grasping,
or an inherently existent delusion be alleviated. The achievement of
nirvāṇa requires dependence, impermanence, and the possibility of
change, all of which are grounded in emptiness.

3\. Unrelinquished, unattained,

Unannihilated, not permanent,

Unarisen, unceased:

This is how nirvāṇ[]{#calibre_link-2287}a is described.

It is important that these predicates are all negative in character, and
that they are all expressed, both in Sanskrit and in the Tibetan
translation, with explicitly negative particles (Skt: *a, Tib: med-pa).*
The point is that no ascription of any predicate to nirvāṇa, for
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2288}rjuna, can be literally true. For such a
predication would purport to be an assertion that nirvāṇa is an
ultimately existent phenomenon with a determinate property, and there
are no ultimately existent phenomena, not even nirvāṇa. Because nirvāṇa
can only[]{#calibre_link-2289} be spoken of by contrasting it in some
sense with saṃsāra and because there is no conventionally existent
perceptible entity []{#calibre_link-303}that could serve as a referent
for the term, there is the terrible temptation when speaking of nirvāṇa
to think that, to the extent that one is saying anything true of it in
any[]{#calibre_link-2290} sense, one is literally asserting an ultimate
truth about an inherently existent thing or state. One forgets that once
one transcends the bounds of convention, there is no possibility of
assertion.[]{#calibre_link-771}[^125^](#calibre_link-250){.nounder}

The discussion in XXV: 4-18 is framed by the tetralemma that would
follow from considering nirvāṇa to be something independent about which
something[]{#calibre_link-2291} could be said; or as a proper subject
for a theory; or as a genuine alternative to saṃsāra, from which it is
inherently different. If it were so, it would have to either be
existent, nonexistent, both, or neither. (Note that here Nāgārjuna uses
the terms "existent"/"non-existent" in both[]{#calibre_link-2292} their
adjectival and nominal forms \[Tib:
*dngos/dngos-min//dngos-po/dngos-med,* Skt:
*bhāva/bhāvo//abhāva/abhāvo\]* deliberately calling attention to their
correlation. I have generally translated the Tibetan *"dngos-po"* as
"entity" throughout this text. But for the purposes of
this[]{#calibre_link-2293} discussion in order to highlight the
structure of the text, I switch in the next few verses to "existent.")
Nāgārjuna will now argue that none of these alternatives is possible.

4\. Nirvāṇa is not existent.

It would then have the characteristics of age and death.

There is no existent entity

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2294}
:::

Without age and death.

Nirvāṇa is negatively characterized as release from saṃsāra and the
constant flux, aging, death, and rebirth it comprises. But that means
that since all entities have these characteristics, nirvāṇa cannot be
thought of as an existent[]{#calibre_link-2295} entity. And here we must
be very careful: The point isn't that nirvāṇa can't be thought of as
inherently existent. For inherently existent entities, if there were
such things, would not have these characteristics. In this discussion,
Nāgārjuna is rejecting the notion that nirvā[]{#calibre_link-2296}ṇa can
be thought of as existent in any sense at all---even as a conventional
entity. That is why we must be so careful in our discourse---very
careful indeed---for, as we shall []{#calibre_link-389}see in a moment,
neither do we want to say that nirvāṇa is nonexistent. But moreover,
Nāgārjuna will[]{#calibre_link-2297} want in another sense to identify
nirvāṇa and saṃsāra (see XXV: 19,20 below), and there is clearly a sense
in which we can say that samsaric phenomena exist and a sense in which
we can say that they do not. (Again, see the discussion of the positive
tetralemma in XVIII: 8 above.) The point here is
that[]{#calibre_link-2298} though things seen from the standpoint of
saṃsāra and from the standpoint of nirvāṇa are not different in entity,
from the standpoint of saṃsāra they can be characterized and appear *as
entities.* But from the standpoint of nirvā[]{#calibre_link-2299}ṇa, no
characterization is possible since that involves the dualities and
dichotomies introduced by language, including the positing of entities
and characteristics, as well as their contraries and complements. These
have only conventional and nominal existence, and no existence at all
from the standpoint of nirvāṇa. (See also the[]{#calibre_link-2300}
discussion of XXVII: 30 below.) In a sense this discussion can be seen
as a useful commentary on chapter IX of the *Vimilakīrti-nirdesa-śūtra*
and, in particular, on the dramatic concluding remarks by Manjuśri and
nonremarks by Vimalakīrti on the subject of nonduality and insight into
emptiness: Manjuśri indicates that the distinction between the
conventional and ultimate[]{#calibre_link-2301} is itself dualistic and
hence merely conventional. To realize it is hence to enter into nondual
awareness of emptiness. He then asks Vimalakīrti to comment on
nonduality. Vimalakīrti remains
silent.[]{#calibre_link-773}[^126^](#calibre_link-251){.nounder}

5\. If nirvāṇa were existent,

Nirvāṇa would be compounded.

A non-compounded existent

Does not exist[]{#calibre_link-2302} anywhere.

[]{#calibre_link-363}All empirical phenomena are compounded. But being
compounded involves phenomena in the round of saṃsāra. For since the
recognition of compounds as unitary phenomena demands conventions of
aggregation, to be compounded is, ipso facto, to have a merely
conventional existence. And it is the treatment of merely conventional,
nominally existent[]{#calibre_link-2303} phenomena as inherently
existent entities that generates saṃsāra. That is because from the
standpoint of Buddhist soteriological theory, the foundation of
suffering---the basic condition of saṃsāra---is craving and the
foundation of craving is the root delusion of taking to be inherently
existent---and so[]{#calibre_link-2304} worthy of being craved---that
which is merely conventionally, or nominally existent. We are hence
trapped in saṃsāra exactly to the extent that we mistake the
conventionally existent as inherently existent. So given the contrast
between nirvāṇa and saṃsā[]{#calibre_link-2305}ra and the fact that
everything in saṃsāra is compounded, nirvāṇa cannot be compounded. So it
is not existent, even conventionally.

6\. If nirvāṇa were existent,

How could nirvāṇa be nondependent?

A nondependent[]{#calibre_link-2306} existent

Does not exist anywhere.

Saṃsāra and dependent arising go hand in hand. For a phenomenon to be
dependent is for it to be impermanent and for it to be subject to
destruction. (See the discussion in Chapter XV.) nirvāṇa is supposed to
be beyond all this. It is, by definition, liberation
from[]{#calibre_link-2307} all that characterizes saṃsāra. So again,
nirvāṇa cannot be a conventionally existent entity. (It is important to
see that there is a sense in which nirvāṇa is dependent and a sense in
which it is independent, and these are not contradictory:
nirvā[]{#calibre_link-2308}ṇa is achieved in dependence upon the
practice of the path and the accumulation of wisdom and merit. But once
attained, inasmuch as from the standpoint of nirvāṇa there are no
entities at all, there is nothing on which nirvāṇa can be said to
depend. In this sense it is nondependent.)[]{#calibre_link-2309} But all
of this raises the obvious possibility that nirvāṇa is simply not real
at all---that it is completely nonexistent. This possibility is
considered and rejected in the next two verses:

[]{#calibre_link-530}7. If nirvāṇa were not existent,

How could it be appropriate for it to be nonexistent?

Where nirvā[]{#calibre_link-2310}ṇa is not existent,

It cannot be a nonexistent.

To say that nirvāṇa possesses the positive property of nonexistence is
not coherent either. For then there would be nothing to which the
predicate "nonexistent" could in fact apply. Note the difference between
saying, in the sense relevant here, "nirvāṇ[]{#calibre_link-2311}a is
nonexistent" and "Santa Claus does not exist." The latter, Nāgārjuna
would certainly agree, is not only coherent but true. But in explaining
the semantics of the latter, we can posit a concept of Santa Claus and
interpret the sentence as asserting that that concept is not
instantiated. But when, in trying to characterize
nirvā[]{#calibre_link-2312}ṇa, one is tempted to say that it is a
nonexistent, this is in response to the difficulty we have just noted in
asserting that nirvāṇa in fact exists. The temptation is to assert then
that it is real, but has some kind of ghostly reality as a substratum of
the property "nonexistent." But that is simply incoherent---an attempt
to have[]{#calibre_link-2313} it both ways. So the predicate "does not
exist" cannot, in this case, even be applied. If there is no nirvāṇa at
all, there is no such basis of predication. Even this apparently
negative discourse about nirvāṇa is then blocked, to the degree that it
is taken literally as positive attribution of a
negative[]{#calibre_link-2314} predicate.

8\. If nirvāṇa were not existent,

How could nirvāṇa be nondependent?

Whatever is nondependent

Is not nonexistent.

Moreover, Nāgārjuna reminds us, one of the reasons that we rejected the
view that nirvā[]{#calibre_link-2315}ṇa is an entity in the first place
is that it is nondependent. The latter assertion is, of course, intended
in a merely negative sense---a denial of the possibility of
characterizing nirvāṇa as dependent, or of recognizing dependent
phenomena or dependency from the standpoint of
nirvāṇ[]{#calibre_link-2316}a. But to the extent that we can make sense
of nonexistence as a positive attribute, it would have to be the
attribute of something. And as we have seen---especially
[]{#calibre_link-516}in Chapters VII, XXII, and XXIV---entities can only
be conceived as dependent. So if something is nondependent, it can't
also be a real nonexistent! In the next two verses,
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2317}rjuna reframes the problem about the
ontological status of nirvāṇa in preparation for consideration of the
final two tetralemma possibilities for nirvāṇa---that it is both
existent and nonexistent and that it is neither existent nor
nonexistent:

9\. That which comes and goes

Is dependent and changing.

[]{#calibre_link-2318}That, when it is not dependent and changing,

Is taught to be nirvāṇa.

10\. The teacher has spoken of relinquishing

Becoming and dissolution.

Therefore, it makes sense that

Nirvāṇa is neither existent nor nonexistent.

Nirvāṇa is here again explicitly[]{#calibre_link-2319} characterized
only by contrast with saṃsāra. While it therefore cannot be an entity of
the kind with which saṃsāra is populated, it is, as the release from
saṃsāra, not completely nonexistent. So it can neither be conceived of
conventionally or ultimately[]{#calibre_link-2320} as a thing, nor
coherently asserted not to exist. In fact, as XXV: 9 emphasizes with
eloquence, the very same world is saṃsāra or nirvāṇa, dependent upon
one's perspective. When one perceives the constant arising and ceasing
of phenomena, one perceives saṃsā[]{#calibre_link-2321}ra. When all
reification is abandoned, that world and one's mode of living in it,
becomes
nirvāṇa.[]{#calibre_link-775}[^127^](#calibre_link-252){.nounder}
Nāgārjuna now considers the possibility that nirvāṇa is both existent
and nonexistent:

11\. If nirvāṇ[]{#calibre_link-2322}a were both

Existent and nonexistent,

Passing beyond would, impossibly,

Be both existent and nonexistent.

This would entail that it is contradictory. And it is absurd to assign
anything contradictory properties. Moreover, having seen
[]{#calibre_link-520}that each of the conjuncts is individually
impossible, their conjunction, even were it not a conjunction of
contradictories, could certainly not be coherent.
In[]{#calibre_link-2323} particular, we don't want to say that one does
and does not pass into nirvāṇa upon release from saṃsāra.

12\. If nirvāṇa were both

Existent and nonexistent,

Nirvāṇa would not be nondependent.

Since it[]{#calibre_link-2324} would depend on both of these.

But since both existent and nonexistent entities are dependent, as
Nāgārjuna has argued in XXV: 6, 8, if nirvāa were both existent and
nonexistent it would be doubly dependent. It would depend both on
existent and nonexistent phenomena.

13\. How could nirvā[]{#calibre_link-2325}ṇa

Be both existent and nonexistent?

Nirvāṇa is uncompounded.

Both existents and nonexistents are compounded.

Moreover, not only are existents compounded---that is made up of parts
or given rise to by causes---but genuine nonexistents are compounded as
well---their nonexistence is determined by the nature of other things;
if real,[]{#calibre_link-2326} they would be composed of parts. A
nonexistent elephant is composed of a nonexistent trunk, tusks, and so
forth.

14\. How could nirvāṇa

Be both existent and nonexistent?

These two cannot be in the same place.

Like light and darkness.

This verse simply sums up the results of the previous three: There is
simply no way to avoid manifest contradiction[]{#calibre_link-2327} if
one takes this horn of the tetralemma. Nāgārjuna now considers the final
possibility---that nirvāṇa is neither existent nor
nonexistent:[]{#calibre_link-777}[^128^](#calibre_link-253){.nounder}

[]{#calibre_link-2328}15. Nirvāṇa is said to be

Neither existent nor nonexistent.

If the existent and the nonexistent[]{#calibre_link-2329} were
established,

This would be established

But this can't be so either. For really to assert this as the nature of
nirvāṇa would be to suppose that both of these possibilities made sense
with respect to it, but that neither happened to be realized. But it
makes no sense for nirvāṇa to exist. And[]{#calibre_link-2330} it makes
no sense for it not to exist. So of each, the negation can't be assigned
any coherent meaning. And conjoining two pieces of nonsense only yields
further nonsense.

16\. If nirvāṇa is

Neither existent nor nonexistent,

Then by whom is it expounded

"Neither existent nor nonexistent"?

If this could be coherently asserted, it would have
to[]{#calibre_link-2331} be asserted either by one in nirvāṇa or one
not. But, as is emphasized in the next verse, this has never been
asserted by anyone certifiably in nirvāṇa. And if it is asserted by
someone in saṃsāra, we have no particular reason to believe it.

17\. Having[]{#calibre_link-2332} passed into nirvāṇa, the Victorious
Conqueror

Is neither said to be existent

Nor said to be nonexistent.

Neither both nor neither are said.

18\. So, when the victorious one abides, he

Is neither said to be existent

Nor said to be nonexistent.

Neither both nor neither are said.

None of the four tetralemma possibilities can be asserted.
Just[]{#calibre_link-2333} as in Chapter XXII, we see that when things
are plausibly posited by an interlocutor as ultimates, Nāgārjuna resorts
to a negative tetralemma. This emphasizes that all discourse is only
possible from the conventional point of view. When we try to say
something coherent []{#calibre_link-422}about the nature of things from
an ultimate standpoint, we end up[]{#calibre_link-2334} talking
nonsense.[]{#calibre_link-779}[^129^](#calibre_link-254){.nounder} But
recall the discussion of emptiness and convention in chapter XXIV: We
can develop an understanding of emptiness in relation to conventional
reality, of emptiness as empty: Emptiness seen that way simply is the
lack of essence of the conventional. Its own emptiness is the fact that
it itself is no more than that. Seeing the conventional as conventional,
we argued, is to[]{#calibre_link-2335} see it as it is ultimately. At
this point, Nāgārjuna makes a similar move with regard to nirvāṇa and
draws one of the most startling conclusions of the
*Mūlamadhyamakakārikā:* Just as there is no
difference[]{#calibre_link-2336} in entity between the conventional and
the ultimate, there is no difference in entity between nirvāṇa and
saṃsāra; nirvāṇa is simply saṃsāra seen without reification, without
attachment, without delusion.[]{#calibre_link-2337} The reason that we
cannot say anything about nirvāṇa as an independent, nonsamsaric entity,
then, is not that it *is* such an entity, but that it is ineffable and
unknowable.[]{#calibre_link-780}[^130^](#calibre_link-255){.nounder}
Rather it is because it is only saṃsāra seen as it is, just as emptiness
is just the conventional seen as it is:

19\. There[]{#calibre_link-2338} is not the slightest difference

Between cyclic existence and nirvāṇa.

There is not the slightest difference

Between nirvāṇa and cyclic existence.

20\. Whatever is the limit of nirvāṇa,

That is the limit of cyclic existence.

There is not even the slightest[]{#calibre_link-2339} difference between
them,

Or even the subtlest thing.

To distinguish between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa would be to suppose that each
had a nature and that they were different natures. But each is empty,
and so there can be no inherent difference. Moreover, since
nirvāṇ[]{#calibre_link-2340}a is by definition the cessation of delusion
and of grasping and, hence, of the reification of self and other and of
confusing imputed phenomena for inherently real phenomena,
[]{#calibre_link-320}it is by definition the recognition of the ultimate
nature of things. But if, as Nāgārjuna argued in Chapter XXIV, this is
simply to see conventional things as empty,[]{#calibre_link-2341} not to
see some separate emptiness behind them, then nirvāṇa must be
ontologically grounded in the conventional. To be in saṃsāra is to see
things as they appear to deluded consciousness and to interact with them
accordingly. To be in nirvāṇa, then, is[]{#calibre_link-2342} to see
those things as they are---as merely empty, dependent, impermanent, and
nonsubstantial, but not to be somewhere else, seeing something
else.[]{#calibre_link-782}[^131^](#calibre_link-256){.nounder}

Another way of distinguishing between saṃone perceivessāra and nirvāṇa
is to think of them somehow as different places, as Earth and Heaven are
often[]{#calibre_link-2343} conceived in Western religious traditions
and then to think that upon attaining nirvāṇa one leaves this
place---disappears---and goes there. Of course, if one thinks at all
about the career of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni, that would entail
that upon attaining enlightenment, he would have disappeared. This would
make something of a hash of the Buddhist[]{#calibre_link-2344} canon.
But Nāgārjuna is emphasizing that nirvāṇa is not someplace else. It is a
way of being here.

Here is another way to put the somewhat paradoxical point: Nāgārjuna
surely thinks that in nirvāṇ[]{#calibre_link-2345}a, unlike saṃsāra, one
perceives emptiness and not entities; one perceives the ultimate truth
and not the conventional
truth.[]{#calibre_link-783}[^132^](#calibre_link-257){.nounder} But
emptiness is only the emptiness []{#calibre_link-482}of all entities,
and the ultimate truth is merely the essenceless essence of those
conventional things. So nirvāṇa is only saṃ[]{#calibre_link-2346}sāra
experienced as a buddha experiences it. It is the person who enters
nirvāṇa, but as a state of being, not as a place to
be.[]{#calibre_link-785}[^133^](#calibre_link-258){.nounder}

21\. Views that after cessation there is a limit, etc.,

And that it is permanent, etc.,

Depend upon nirvāṇa, the final limit,

And the prior[]{#calibre_link-2347} limit.

The kind of metaphysical speculations that the Buddha discouraged in the
famous discussion of the unanswerable questions regarding the origins
and limits of the world and what lies beyond the universe in space and
time, are grounded, Nāgārjuna asserts, in the view that cyclic
existence---the entire phenomenal world---can be
conceived[]{#calibre_link-2348} as an entity against which stand other
entities or other regions. This is the same kind of picture that
motivates the view that nirvāṇa is someplace or something beyond cyclic
existence or that nirvāṇa is bounded or eternal. But there is no vantage
point from which the universe is one place among
many.[]{#calibre_link-2349} That is why talking about what lies beyond
it is nonsense and why reifying or characterizing nirvāṇa temporally is
one example of that nonsense.

22\. Since all existents are empty,

What is finite or infinite?

What is finite and infinite?

What is neither finite nor infinite?

23\. What is identical and what is different?

What is permanent and what[]{#calibre_link-2350} is impermanent?

What is both permanent and impermanent?

What is neither?

[]{#calibre_link-522}Again Nāgārjuna uses negative tetralemmas to
emphasize that while of conventional entities a good deal can be said,
so long as we take the predications to be asserted in a conventional,
relative sense, the moment we try to conceive of things as they are
ultimately,[]{#calibre_link-2351} as empty, such assertion has to stop.
That is not, again, to say that things are nonempty. Far from it. But it
is to say that literal description applies only within the bounds of
conception and that attempts to develop a metaphysics of the ultimate
are doomed.[]{#calibre_link-787}[^134^](#calibre_link-259){.nounder}

24\. The pacification of all objectification

And the pacification of illusion:

No Dharma was taught by the Buddha

At any time, in[]{#calibre_link-2352} any place, to any person.

In many Buddhist teachings many conventional phenomena are described and
are subjected to analysis, including the mind, mental phenomena, and a
wide range of external phenomena. But this is always a conventional
analysis intended to demonstrate the emptiness of these phenomena, their
impermanent character, and so forth, for soteriological purposes. The
goal is to dispel[]{#calibre_link-2353} illusion and to end deluded
ontological fabrication and the various epistemological, psychological,
and moral ills Nāgārjuna has argued are grounded therein. But it is
important, Nāgārjuna concludes, not to reify that doctrine, or any of
the entities that appear as prima facie[]{#calibre_link-2354} referents
of the words used to expound it (the Buddha, the spiritual community,
etc.,). In fact, it is important to see that nirvāṇa does not, on this
account, amount to an entity; it is not achieved or described by
entities. Rather it is a way of engagement with nonentities by
nonentities.

## **[]{#calibre_link-275 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-65 .calibre4}Chapter XXVI  Examination of the Twelve Links** {#chapter-xxvi-examination-of-the-twelve-links-1 .h1}

Given an analysis of the nature of nirvāṇa, one might well ask how to
achieve it. In this chapter, Nāgārjuna provides a straightforward
answer. The twelve links of dependent origination are regarded by all
Buddhist schools as providing an analysis[]{#calibre_link-2357} of the
nature of interdependence in the context of human existence. The tone of
this chapter is decidedly positive, marking the turning of a dialectical
corner in the preceding two chapters. Having elucidated the Mādhyamika
account of the nature of conventional and ultimate reality, Nāgārjuna
does not need[]{#calibre_link-2358} at this point so much to emphasize
the emptiness of the twelve links. Rather he can assume that to provide
an account of them as dependently arisen is, ipso facto, to demonstrate
that fact. Their emptiness is therefore simply presupposed. This chapter
is thus a straightforward exposition of how, in light of the
interdependence of the twelve links, to enter into and to exploit the
cycle in the service[]{#calibre_link-2359} of liberation.

1\. Wrapped in the darkness of ignorance,

One performs the three kinds of actions

Which as dispositions impel one

To continue to future existences.

One is caught in cyclic existence for a reason, Nāgārjuna asserts,
because one acts. There are three general kinds of actions distinguished
[]{#calibre_link-489}in Buddhist action
theory---physical,[]{#calibre_link-2360} verbal, and mental. These
actions in turn have immediate psychological consequences for the agent.
That is, they give rise to new psychological dispositions. In the
framework of Buddhist action theory, these dispositions are themselves
conceived of as actions existing in a potential form, and of course when
actualized, they emerge as new actions of body, speech, or mind. These
in turn lead[]{#calibre_link-2361} to a variety of new such consequences
and to the continuation of cyclic
existence.[]{#calibre_link-789}[^135^](#calibre_link-261){.nounder}
Transmigration---the continuation of saṃsāra---for Nāgārjuna is then
simply a dependent consequence of one's actions.

2\. Having dispositions as its conditions,

Consciousness enters transmigration.

Once consciousness[]{#calibre_link-2362} has entered transmigration,

Name and form come to be.

Continuing through the traditional presentation of the twelve links,
Nāgārjuna notes that consciousness is a consequence of dispositions and
depends upon them and that "name and form" follow as a consequence of
consciousness. These, therefore, are obviously also dependent phenomena.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2363}
:::

There are two ways to think of the twelve links, generating two parallel
circles of explanation: One can approach them from the standpoint of
transmigration, which provides a standard Buddhist explanation of the
cycle of life. Or one can think of them as providing a phenomenological
analysis of the nature of experience. In the former sense, we could say
at this point in the story that actions[]{#calibre_link-2364} performed
in the past and dispositions inherited from one's previous history lead
to new actions whose consequences are cyclic existence. In particular,
the actions and dispositions from one's prior life, on this view, lead
to the generation of a new consciousness, which upon entering the womb,
gives rise to a body that will get a particular name.

Or, from a phenomenological perspective, we can[]{#calibre_link-2365}
see dispositions to attend to or to interpret particular phenomena in
certain []{#calibre_link-383}ways (perceptual or conceptual "sets") and
actions upon them leading to our becoming aware of external or internal
phenomena (consciousness), which leads to our representing them as
having determinate locations and denominations (name and form). These
two levels of analysis are obviously quite compatible, and while
the[]{#calibre_link-2366} former plays a central role in Buddhist
cosmologica and soteriological theory, the latter is important in
Buddhist psychology and practice.

3\. Once name and form come to be,

The six sense spheres come into being.

Depending on the six sense spheres,

Contact comes into being.

From the ontogenetic side, the development of the body gives rise to the
development of the sense faculties, which make[]{#calibre_link-2367}
sensation---contact between sense objects and functioning sense
organs---possible. From the phenomenological point of view, we can say
that the domain of perceptibles and the structure of perceptual
experience and knowledge depends upon our ability to represent and
individuate objects, and that sensory contact is sensory contact in the
first place only in virtue of its role in experience, which
is[]{#calibre_link-2368} in turn dependent upon the entire perceptual
process. To put the matter crudely, an amputated sense organ in contact
with an object is hardly in contact in the appropriate way.

4\. That is only dependent

On eye and form and apprehension.

Thus, depending on name and form,

And which produces consciousness---

The first two lines emphasize that contact---that is, the initial
relation between the sense[]{#calibre_link-2369} organ and its
object---has three necessary and sufficient conditions: sense organ, the
object, and the cognitive state to which the sense organ gives rise
(apprehension/*dran by ed).* The last two lines are continuous with the
next verse:

5\. That which is assembled from the three---

Eye and form and consciousness,

[]{#calibre_link-385}Is contact. From contact

Feeling comes to be.

It is important to note that this occurrence[]{#calibre_link-2370} of
"consciousness" *(rnam-par* *shes-pa)*in fact refers to the apprehension
of the previous verse, which is in Buddhist psychology a form of
consciousness. But it should *not* be confused with the consciousness
whose condition is contact, on pain of a hopeless explanatory tangle.
Contact, as we have seen, is dependent upon the existence of the organ,
the object, and the functioning of the sense
faculty.[]{#calibre_link-2371} Dependent upon that contact is sensation.
The exposition here is perfectly traditional. It only derives its punch
from the context: In light of the connection that has been developed
between the dependence that is central to this model and emptiness, the
entire Theravada model of the nature of the phenomenal world comes to
look like an analysis in terms of emptiness.

6\. Conditioned by feeling[]{#calibre_link-2372} is craving.

Craving arises because of feeling.

When it appears, there is grasping,

The four spheres of grasping.

Pleasurable sensations lead to craving; painful ones lead to craving for
their end. That craving leads to grasping---an attempt to appropriate
and make one's own the source of pleasure or the means for the
alleviation of pain, and to excessive valuation of the grasped object.
The[]{#calibre_link-2373} four spheres probably denote the four
realms---the desire, the form, the formless, and the pure, entities in
each of which could be the objects of grasping.

7\. When there is grasping, the grasper

Comes into existence.

If he did not grasp,

Then being freed, he would not come into existence.

The identity of the individual as a grasper---and hence as a deluded
actor in the world and an agent of[]{#calibre_link-2374} the
continuation of saṃsara---depends upon this grasping. As Nāgārjuna
argued in Chapters VI and XVI, without grasping, there is no grasper.

[]{#calibre_link-276}8. This existence is also the five aggregates.

From existence comes birth,

Old age and death and misery and

Suffering and grief and . . .

9\. Confusion and agitation.

All these[]{#calibre_link-2375} arise as a consequence of birth.

Thus this entire mass of suffering

Comes into being.

But moreover, the account that emerges so far of the nature of human
existence---one involving a body, sensations, perception, dispositions,
and consciousness---is just the account of personal existence in terms
of the five aggregates into which standard Buddhist psychology analyzes
the person. So this account[]{#calibre_link-2376} so far is an account
of the conditions that give rise to human existence. But human existence
gives rise to human births, and these eventually give rise to aging, to
pain and suffering, and eventually to death and the consequent grief of
one's loved ones. This part of the story, of course, is central to
making the case for the first two noble truths.

We are born with dispositions to reify, to[]{#calibre_link-2377} crave,
and to grasp, all of which, on this analysis, lead directly to
suffering---to the pain of wanting what we cannot have, of not wanting
what we do have, of grasping onto permanence in an impermanent world, of
cherishing our own existence and interests in a world where they are
minor affairs, and of grasping for independence and freedom in a
conditioned universe.

10\. The root of cyclic existence[]{#calibre_link-2378} is action.

Therefore, the wise one does not
act.[]{#calibre_link-791}[^136^](#calibre_link-262){.nounder}

[]{#calibre_link-402}Therefore, the unwise is the agent.

The wise one is not because of his insight.

The place to pick up the tangle in order to unravel it, from the
standpoint of practice, Nāgārjuna suggests, is with action and
disposition, here comprised together under the single term "action"
*('du* *[]{#calibre_link-2379}byed),*which in this context conveys not
only the unity of action and disposition as seen from the soteriological
point of view, but also their role in creating or bringing about future
existence. These are most easily controlled through philosophical
reflection, through meditation, and through assiduous practices of
various virtues. By changing the way that we act physically, verbally,
and mentally,[]{#calibre_link-2380} we thereby change the way that we
perceive, think, and act and thereby change what we see and the
consequences of our actions.

11\. With the cessation of ignorance

Action will not arise.

The cessation of ignorance occurs through

Meditation and wisdom.

But in order really to modify our actions and dispositions to act, we
need wisdom---in this context an understanding of the real nature of
things,[]{#calibre_link-2381} which for Nāgārjuna means the view of all
things as empty. This view, Nāgārjuna asserts, must be internalized
through meditation, so that it becomes not merely a philosophical theory
that we can reason our way into, but the basic way in which we take up
with the world. Accomplishing[]{#calibre_link-2382} that, he asserts,
leads to the cessation of that activity responsible for the perpetuation
of the suffering of saṃsāra.

12\. Through the cessation of this and that

This and that will not be manifest.

[]{#calibre_link-2383}The entire mass of suffering

Indeed thereby completely ceases.

And this is not only the analysis Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2384}rjuna offers
of the world and of our experience of it, but his final soteriological
recommendation given the doctrine of the emptiness of all phenomena.
Human existence and experience are indeed governed by the twelve links
of dependent origination. But since they are essentially dependent, they
are essentially empty and, hence, are impermanent and subject to change.
The twelve links provide an[]{#calibre_link-2385} anatomy and an
etiology of suffering. But by understanding their impermanence and
dependency, we also see the cure for that condition. For by cultivating
a clear and accurate philosophical view of the nature of things---the
view so explicitly articulated in Chapter XXIV, by internalizing that
view, and by taking up with the world in accordance with it, we can
cease the reification of the "this" and[]{#calibre_link-2386} the
"that," grasping for which binds us to suffering. Nāgārjuna argues that
if we can achieve that, we can achieve the nirvāṇa characterized in
Chapter XXV---a nirvāṇa not found in an escape from the world but in an
enlightened and awakened engagement[]{#calibre_link-2387} with it.

## **[]{#calibre_link-548 .calibre4}[]{#calibre_link-66 .calibre4}Chapter XXVII  Examination of Views** {#chapter-xxvii-examination-of-views-1 .h1}

The final chapter of the text, like the previous chapter, applies the
results of the climactic analyses of Chapters XXIV and XXV. It is
noteworthy that all of the classic erroneous views discussed and refuted
in this chapter are refuted earlier in the text. Indeed, Chapters XXIV
and XXV are immediately preceded by a chapter on errors. One might
therefore think[]{#calibre_link-2390} that this chapter is otiose, or at
least misplaced. For here Nāgārjuna considers a range of alternative
metaphysical views conflicting with Nāgārjuna's analysis in terms of
emptiness. These views are all well-known and considered false by all
schools of Buddhist philosophy. So[]{#calibre_link-2391} why does
Nāgārjuna return to them as a collection at the close of the text?

The previous chapter demonstrated the positive payoff of the analysis of
emptiness and its relation to conventional phenomena. Nāgārjuna there
argued that one can exploit emptiness and an
understanding[]{#calibre_link-2392} of emptiness in following the path
to nirvāṇa. But the pursuit of the path entails the elimination of
error. In fact, it can negatively be characterized, as we saw in the
nirvāṇa chapter, specifically as the elimination of error. So it is
important for Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2393}rjuna to show that the analysis
developed in XXIV and XXV can not only promote positive movement toward
nirvāṇa but also the eradication of the erroneous views that bind us to
saṃsāra. That is the burden of this final chapter. It is also important
dialectically to see that Nā[]{#calibre_link-2394}gārjuna is
demonstrating that the root of all of []{#calibre_link-531}these
erroneous views is the view that the self or the external world exist
inherently. If, he will argue, one grants either of those claims, one is
stuck with one or more of these errors. It therefore follows that any
view, including any view of any other Buddhist school---including all of
the schools that castigate these[]{#calibre_link-2395} views on
independent grounds---that posits inherently existent entities will
succumb to these errors. Nāgārjuna thus concludes by arguing not only
that his position is capable of leading to nirvāṇa, but that it is the
only position capable of doing so.

1\. The views "in the past I was" or[]{#calibre_link-2396} "I was not"

And the view that the world is permanent, etc.,

All of these views

Depend on a prior limit.

Nāgārjuna summarizes the diagnosis he will offer of the error underlying
these metaphysical views: Any view that the self is permanent or
nonexistent or that the world is permanent or nonexistent presupposes
that one can think coherently[]{#calibre_link-2397} about the beginning
of time or of identity. For to think of things as permanent requires us
either to posit a beginning of time from which they existed or to assert
that time has no beginning. To think that there was a past at which the
self did not exist or in which the world did not exist presupposes that
we can mark a point at which the world came into existence or at which
there is a[]{#calibre_link-2398} definite separation between a world
without the self and a world with the self---an initial moment of
personal existence.

2\. The view "in the future I will become other" or "I will not do so"

And that the world is limited, etc.,

All of these views

Depend on a final limit.

Similarly, such views require us to be able to talk coherently about the
end of the world or the end of personal
existence---to[]{#calibre_link-2399} be able to speak of a future time
where nothing exists, or of the end of time, or of an unlimited future
existence or of a definite moment []{#calibre_link-2400}when the self
ceases to exist, whereas before it had existed. Nāgārjuna begins by
discussing arguments regarding the self, opening with a set of arguments
for the permanence of the self:

3\. To say[]{#calibre_link-2401} "I was in the past"

Is not tenable.

What existed in the past

Is not identical to this one.

It is a fundamental confusion to think that because I can say that I or
someone or something else existed in the past that there is a real
identity between what exists now and what existed then. Identity
requires that we share all properties, and that is trivially impossible
over time. But any assertion[]{#calibre_link-2402} of the permanence of
the self requires that we be able to identity it over time.

4\. According to you, this self is that,

But the appropriator is different.

If it is not the appropriator,

What is your self?

Suppose that one through introspection or analysis takes some putative
entity---one's body, one's stream of consciousness, or whatever---to be
one's self. There will be in that act a duality[]{#calibre_link-2403} of
appropriator and the thing appropriated as the self or as part of the
self. But at different times what is appropriated and what is
appropriating differ. Both subject and object will necessarily be
distinct. But in order to posit the appropriating entity as the self, it
must retain its identity over time. The sequence of appropriators hence
fails to provide a candidate for a continuing
self.[]{#calibre_link-2404} But, Nāgārjuna points out, there is no other
candidate.

5\. Having shown that there is no self

Other than the appropriator,

The appropriator should be the self.

But it is not your self.

The self that is posited by the advocate of a permanent self is a
substantial entity capable of grasping, not a mere evanescent activity.
[]{#calibre_link-2405}So it cannot[]{#calibre_link-2406} be the
appropriator. Moreover, Nāgārjuna points out in the next verse, the same
argument applies, mutatis mutandis, to the act of appropriation. To
identify that with the self would be to identify agent and action:

6\. Appropriating is not the self.

It arises and ceases.

How can one accept that

Future appropriating is the appropriator?

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2407}
:::

Two problems are developed in this verse: First of all, the self that
the reificationist wishes to posit is a permanent, enduring self. But
appropriating is a momentary action that arises and ceases constantly
with new objects of appropriation. A sequence of such actions is hardly
a substantial subject. This is a straightforwardly Humean argument.
Second, Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2408}rjuna points out, even if one argued
that the self was substantial and also identical to that sequence, there
is a further difficulty: The self that is posited by this interlocutor
is an enduring subject of these acts of appropriation. But some of the
members of the sequence have yet to come into existence. If the self
exists entirely at all moments of time, as an unchanging substantial
subject,[]{#calibre_link-2409} it cannot be identified with a sequence,
some of whose members are not presently existent.

7\. A self that is different

From the appropriating is not tenable.

If it were different, then in a nonappropriator

There should be appropriation. But there isn't.

This is a very obscure argument as it is put in the text, but given the
context we can flesh it out: The target position here is one
according[]{#calibre_link-2410} to which the existence of appropriation
as a real, persistent feature of cyclic existence is used as the basis
for attributing personal identity to a continuing self. That self is not
supposed to be the appropriating itself, but rather a separate entity
independent of it. Nāgārjuna points out, though, that it is, and for the
proponent[]{#calibre_link-2411} of this view, it must be possible not to
appropriate---otherwise nirvāṇa would be impossible. So, there will be a
[]{#calibre_link-2412}nonappropriator who once was an appropriator. But
if appropriation is the basis of the identity of the one who has been
liberated with the one who was not, that appropriation should persist in
the nonappropriator, which would be contradictory.

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2413}
:::

8\. So it is neither different from the appropriating

Nor identical to the appropriating.

There is no self without appropriation.

But it is not true that it does not exist.

Thus we cannot use the existence of appropriation as a basis on which to
construct a permanent self. For that self cannot be both permanent and
identified with such a constantly changing activity. But still, that is
all[]{#calibre_link-2414} there is to the self. This raises the
possibility that it would be correct to say that the self does not
persist at all---that there is no existent person in any sense. It is to
this view that Nāgārjuna now turns. He first announces the
conclusion---that it is not correct to say that the person who now
exists did not exist in the past. There[]{#calibre_link-2415} is a sense
in which that person is identical with his/ her past stages:

9\. To say "in the past I wasn't"

Would not be tenable.

This person is not different

From whoever existed in previous times.

10\. If this one were different,

Then if that one did not exist, I would still exist.

If this were so,

Without death, one would be born.

If there were a genuine difference in entity between
the[]{#calibre_link-2416} current stage and the previous stages of a
person, they would be independent. If that were so, the current
stage---since if it depends on anything, depends on the previous
stage---would come into existence depending on nothing. That is, it
would be possible for none of my previous stages to exist, but for me,
as the person with my past, to pop into existence ex nihilo. Or, on the
other hand, it would[]{#calibre_link-2417} be possible, if the current
stage and previous stages were []{#calibre_link-2418}completely
different and independent, for the current stage to come into existence
without the previous stage having passed out of existence, which is
absurd.

11\. Annihilation and the exhaustion of action would follow;

Different agents' actions

Would be experienced by each other.

That and other such things would follow.

We could make[]{#calibre_link-2419} no sense of the actual empirical
fact of conventional personal identity; action done at one moment would
be done by one person, and that person would experience none of its
consequences. To the extent that we could make sense of them at all, the
phenomena of memory and experiencing the consequences of one's previous
actions would become interpersonal affairs, which seems at least a bit
odd.

[]{#calibre_link-2420}12. Nothing comes to exist from something that did
not exist.

From this errors would arise.

The self would be produced

Or, existing, would be without a cause.

Moreover, since the past, as per the discussion of time in Chapter XIX
and the discussion of dependent origination in VII, does not actually
exist, we would have the consequence of an existent (the present person)
being brought into existence[]{#calibre_link-2421} dependent upon
something that no longer exists (some past person). Anything that exists
has some past.

13\. So, the views "I existed," "I didn't exist,"

Both or neither,

In the past

Are untenable.

While Nāgārjuna has not explicitly considered the "both" or "neither"
horns of the tetralemma, we have seen enough of these arguments
by[]{#calibre_link-2422} this stage to know how to complete the picture.
Since neither a continually existent nor a discontinuous self makes
sense, both can't make sense since that would just be double nonsense.
[]{#calibre_link-2423}And the "neither" option is not open since there
is no third alternative. Nāgārjuna now points out that the argument
applies straightforwardly to the[]{#calibre_link-2424} future existence
of the self:

14\. To say "In the future I will exist or

Will not exist,"

Such a view is like

Those involving the past.

Another possible avenue to a permanent self is the classical Indian view
(not unlike certain Judeo-Christian views) that the human soul partakes
of the divine, and that its divinity is what engenders its eternality:

15\. If a human were a god,

On such a view[]{#calibre_link-2425} there would be permanence.

The god would be unborn.

For any permanent thing is unborn.

16\. If a human were different from a god,

On such a view there would be impermanence.

If the human were different from the god,

A continuum would not be tenable.

But if the human is at all different from a god, as is eminently
plausible (i.e., nobody seriously argues that humans simply *are*gods),
then[]{#calibre_link-2426} the permanence of the divine in no way
entails the permanence of the person. There is another possibility,
however, namely that the person is part divine and part mortal:

17\. If one part were divine and

One part were human,

It would be both permanent and impermanent.

That would be irrational.

The problem with this option is that either we say that the person is
both permanent and impermanent,[]{#calibre_link-2427} which is
contradictory, or that the divine part is permanent and the mortal part
impermanent. But if the person is a mereological sum of these two parts,
[]{#calibre_link-2428}then since there is an impermanent part, the whole
is constantly changing and the inherent identity of the person from
moment to moment is still lost.

18\. If it could be established that

It is both permanent and impermanent,

Then it could[]{#calibre_link-2429} be established that

It is neither permanent nor impermanent.

That is, the "both" and "neither" horns of the tetralemma stand or fall
together. Permanence and impermanence are mutually exclusive and
exhaustive alternatives. They can neither be co-present nor co-absent.
(The option of asserting them in different voices-conventional and
ultimate---is not open to the opponent here, who is trying
to[]{#calibre_link-2430} defend an inherently existent self.)

19\. If anyone had come from anyplace

And were then to go someplace,

It would follow that cyclic existence was beginningless.

This is not the case.

As Nāgārjuna has argued, if there were to be true identity through time,
so that the person who exists now is literally identical to one who
existed[]{#calibre_link-2431} in the past and to one who will exist in
the future, this would have to be in virtue of sharing some essence. But
this would make real change impossible. The person, once in saṃsāra,
would be there essentially---the state of being in saṃsāra would hence
be inherently existent. (Here Nā[]{#calibre_link-2432}gārjuna is using
the term "beginningless" as a synonym for "inherently existent.") If
saṃsāra were inherently existent, it would have to be eternal and
unchanging. Nirvāna would be unattainable, and saṃsāra would be utterly
hopeless. But given[]{#calibre_link-2433} the possibility of
transformation, it follows that such literal identity must be abandoned.

20\. If nothing is permanent,

What will be impermanent,

Permanent and impermanent,

Or neither?

[]{#calibre_link-551}Finally, given that there are no permanent
entities, no entities, from the ultimate point of view, can serve as
inherent bases of predication. That is, the views that
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2434}rjuna has been considering regarding the
nature of the self, which purport to give its ultimate nature, must all
be seen as incoherent on that ground alone---namely, that they propose
an ultimate analysis. Nāgārjuna now turns his attention to views not
about the self, per se, but about the world as a whole:

21\. If the world were limited,

::: calibre1
[]{#calibre_link-2435}
:::

How could there be another world?

If the world were unlimited,

How could there be another world?

Nāgārjuna begins by questioning the sense of the question regarding the
limits of the world: It seems to be like a question about the size of a
table. But it is not. It is not, that is, a question about whether there
is anything beyond[]{#calibre_link-2436} the world. For suppose that the
world is limited. That suggests that there is something beyond it. But
that just means that we haven't come to the end of the world. The whole
world includes that stuff that lies beyond. Or suppose that the world is
unlimited. That suggests that there is nothing beyond the world. But
that just means that everything that is in the world is, in fact, in the
world, which[]{#calibre_link-2437} is trivial. The question regarding
the limits of the world, so Nāgārjuna suggests, is nonsensical.

22\. Since the continuum of the aggregates

Is like the flame of a butterlamp,

It follows that neither its finitude

Nor its infinitude makes sense.

In this discussion, Nāgārjuna[]{#calibre_link-2438} is focusing on the
temporal limits of the world. Again, the question regarding whether the
world has temporal limits presupposes that it is a single entity that
either exists forever or that passes out of existence. But the world,
Nāgārjuna suggests, is more like a flame. It is a series of distinct
flickering events. While each event[]{#calibre_link-2439} is momentary,
the sequence []{#calibre_link-2440}continues. But there is no entity
that persists and can be said to be eternal or momentary.

23\. If the previous were disintegrating

And these aggregates, which depend

Upon those aggregates, did not arise,

Then the world would be finite.

We could say that the world is finite if its current state simply ceased
and nothing else arose. But absent that, there is no
basis[]{#calibre_link-2441} for positing an end, and dependent
origination argues against positing an end to the world in time.

24\. If the previous were not disintegrating

And these aggregates, which depend

Upon those aggregates, did not arise,

Then the world would be infinite.

On the other hand, the world would be infinite if it reached a stage
where its current state became permanent. But again, given the nature
of[]{#calibre_link-2442} dependent arising, this is not a likely
eventuality.

25\. If one part were finite and

One part were infinite,

Then the world would be finite and infinite.

This would make no sense.

Nāgārjuna now makes use of the argument mobilized at XXVII: 17. The
world cannot have these contradictory properties any more than an
individual can.

[]{#calibre_link-2443}26. How could one think that

One part of the appropriator is destroyed

And one part is not destroyed?

This position makes no sense.

27\. How could one think that

One part of the appropriation is destroyed

And one part is not destroyed?

This position makes no sense.

[]{#calibre_link-549}The appropriator here is the self; the
appropriation, the existence of the world.
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2444}rjuna in these two verses is summing up and
drawing together the conclusions of the two main arguments in the
chapter. We want to say on the one hand that neither the world nor the
self is permanent. Both are thoroughly characterized by impermanence. On
the other hand, we want to say of both that they endure in time and of
each that there is no fixed boundary to its identity. But it can't be
that[]{#calibre_link-2445} either has both of these properties.

28\. If it could be established that

It is both finite and infinite,

Then it could be established that

It is neither finite nor infinite.

This verse echoes XXVII: 18. If either the self or the world could be
conceived as both finite and infinite, finitude and infinitude would
make no sense at all. They are contradictory properties and cannot
characterize[]{#calibre_link-2446} the same thing at the same time.
Moreover, they are exhaustive alternatives.

29\. So, because all entities are empty,

Which views of permanence, etc., would occur,

And to whom, when, why, and about what

Would they occur at all?

But if we bear in mind the emptiness of all phenomena, on the subject
and on the object side, these views do not even arise as possibilities.
The self and all of the[]{#calibre_link-2447} phenomena in the world
itself, being empty, are dependently arisen, conventional phenomena.
Their emptiness itself is dependently arisen and empty. There is no
candidate for permanence. There is no candidate for ultimate
impermanence. And to the extent that we grasp and live this truth, there
is no one to stand over and against the world as "I" against "it."

30\. I prostrate to Gautama

Who through[]{#calibre_link-2448} compassion

Taught the true doctrine,

Which leads to the relinquishing of all views.

[]{#calibre_link-298} The most common interpretation of this final verse
has the phrase "all views" (Tib: *lta-ba thams-cad,* Skt: *sarva-dṛ≐⃛i)*
referring to all false views, that is, all views according to which
things have inherent
existence.[]{#calibre_link-793}[^137^](#calibre_link-264){.nounder}
These, after all, are the views under examination and
refutation[]{#calibre_link-2449} in this chapter. And it is the clear
purport of this chapter that these views are the principal hindrances to
enlightenment and the causes of attachment to cyclic existence. On this
reading, Nāgārjuna exempts his own view and therefore the Mādhyamika
understanding of the Buddhist doctrine, which
Nā[]{#calibre_link-2450}gārjuna here reminds us was taught
compassionately explicitly to enable the rejection of these views.
*That* doctrine, or standpoint, on this reading, is not to be
relinquished. Indeed, one might say, it is not even a "view" in the
relevant sense since a view must be a view of something, and the
analysis in terms of emptiness reveals a world with no entities to
view.[]{#calibre_link-2451} This interpretation is urged unanimously by
all of the commentaries with which I am familiar and by many of the
scholars with whom I have consulted.

[]{#calibre_link-470} But there is a second reading available, not
instead of, but in addition to, the standard
reading.[]{#calibre_link-795}[^138^](#calibre_link-265){.nounder} There
is a startling grammatical and poetic parallel between this closing
verse and the dramatic dedicatory verses. Both have the form, if
translated[]{#calibre_link-2452} literally, almost preserving Tibetan
word order, "To him who ... To that \[great one/Gautam\] I prostrate"
*(gang* *gis* ... *dam-pal/go-dam de la phyag-'tshal lo).* The echo at
the end of the opening is apparent, and it draws attention to
Nāgārjuna's denial in the dedication of the possibility of any
predication from the ultimate point of view---of[]{#calibre_link-2453}
the inability to say anything positive that is literally true about the
ultimate nature of things. When this is joined with our reading of such
verses as XVIII: 7,9; XXII: 11, 12, 15; XXIV: 18; and XXV: 23---all of
which emphasize in different ways the impossibility of literal
statements about the ultimate and the merely ostensive character of
language about it, despite the need for such
conventional[]{#calibre_link-2454} assertion to enable one to approach
ultimate truth---we can see a double entendre in this verse. For, if one
reads it not from the conventional point of view as in the previous
interpretation, but as an echo of the dedication, one can see
Nāgārjuna's own view and the Buddhist Dharma itself included under "all
views" and, hence, necessarily[]{#calibre_link-2455} to be relinquished
once it is understood and used. And compare especially XIII: 8:

8\. The victorious ones have said

That emptiness is the relinquishing of all views.

For whomever emptiness is a view,

That one has accomplished nothing.

We can now return to this verse with more of Nāgārjuna's analysis
available: For the practicioner[]{#calibre_link-2456} who directly
realizes emptiness, nothing is present to consciousness but emptiness
itself. For such a []{#calibre_link-304}consciousness, there literally
is no object since there is in such a consciousness no reification of
the kind that gives rise to subject-object duality. Moreover, since such
a consciousness is directed only upon what can be found ultimately to
exist and since nothing can be so found, there is[]{#calibre_link-2457}
literally nothing toward which such a consciousness can be directed. But
this very fact is what is ostended by the dictum that emptiness is
itself empty: Emptiness is not the real object as opposed to the unreal
objects of ordinary perception, not the object that appears when false
appearance is shed. In fact, to the extent that it appears as an object
at all, it does so as falsely as any table. If[]{#calibre_link-2458} so,
the best we can then say is that from such a standpoint the words
"emptiness is empty" ascribe no property to any object at all. From that
standpoint, there is no view to be expressed, where a view is something
that can be given assertoric voice. For a view is possible if, and only
if, (1) there is *something* to view and (2) there is some *way* in
which it is viewed.

That is, first, if it were[]{#calibre_link-2459} possible to have a
(true) view about emptiness, emptiness would have to be a thing---an
object of awareness. But if we supposed that it is, a dilemma emerges:
Emptiness must then exist either conventionally or ultimately. The
latter, as we have seen, is impossible since then it would fail itself
to be empty and not only would a central tenet of Mādhyamika
philosophy[]{#calibre_link-2460} be contradicted, but the remainder
would be rendered incoherent as well. But positing emptiness as a
conventional existent and as the object of a correct view is no better,
for things that appear conventionally appear *as* entities---as
phenomena that exist independently and substantially. And all such
appearance is, from the standpoint of Mādhyamika, in an
important[]{#calibre_link-2461} sense, *false* appearance. To put this
point another way, true predication is always predication from a
perspective in which the subject of the predicate exists and within
which the predicate can be instantiated. For conventional entities, the
conventional standpoint provides such a perspective. But for emptiness,
neither the conventional nor the ultimate standpoint can do the job: In
the conventional[]{#calibre_link-2462} standpoint, there is no
emptiness; in the ultimate standpoint there are no entities at all.

Now let us consider the second entailment---that concerning the manner
in which emptiness would need to be viewed. Views are
[]{#calibre_link-338}views of things under descriptions and, hence, are
views of things as having some nature. I view this paper as paper, as
white, as a bearer of print, as a product of a tree, and
so[]{#calibre_link-2463} forth. And again, so long as I am
characterizing a conventional entity as it is viewed from the
conventional perspective, there is no problem here. But when we attempt
to extend this analysis to emptiness itself, problems arise. For the
attribution of properties---descriptions under which things can be
viewed---again requires the existence of the substrata and the
possibility of their serving as property[]{#calibre_link-2464} bearers,
as well as the dualism between substratum and property this presupposes.
The perspective from which this continued existence and this dualism are
available is the conventional perspective for it is only conventions
that bring ontology into play. But again, in that perspective, we don't
find emptiness; we find all kinds of entities, but we find them *as*
*entities*and, hence, as nonempty.[]{#calibre_link-2465} But from the
perspective in which we find emptiness, we don't find any entities or
any characteristics, not even emptiness itself or the fact of its
emptiness. Hence again, since we can't view emptiness even as empty, in
view of its very emptiness, we can't have a view of emptiness. This
point is made pithily in a verse quoted by
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2466}rjuna in his autocommentary to the *Vigrahavyā
vartanï:*"By their nature, the things are not a determinate entity. For
they have only one nature, i.e. no nature" *(Astasāhasrikā
Prajñāpāramitā-sūtra).*

[]{#calibre_link-2467}
:::

This reading of the concluding verse, and by implication of the related
verses we have noted (particularly XIII: 8), would not entail any
self-refutation or any denial of the need at the conventional level for
the assertion of Buddhist doctrine or the critique articulated by
Nāgārjuna in *Mūlamadhyamakakā[]{#calibre_link-2468}rikā*. On the
contrary, this interpretation would be consistent with the raft metaphor
popular in Buddhist philosophy (one discards the raft after one has
crossed the river; it would be foolish to continue to carry it overland;
similarly, Buddhist teachings are soteriological in intent and are to be
discarded after their goal has been attained) or the laxative
metaphor[]{#calibre_link-2469} of the *Ratnakuta-sūtra* mobilized by
Candrakïrti in his comments on XIII: 8 and Sextus (one wants the
medicine to be expelled along with the pathogenic bowel contents) used
to discourage grasping even to the Dharma. Hence Nāgārjuna acknowledges
that, having announced in the dedication that nothing
[]{#calibre_link-483}can be said truly[]{#calibre_link-2470} about the
final nature of things and having defended this thesis exhaustively in
the text, his words and those of the Buddha cannot even be taken as
literally true about the final nature of things. Hence in order to
realize that nature, one must relinquish even a literal, nonostensive
reading of these
texts.[]{#calibre_link-797}[^139^](#calibre_link-266){.nounder}
[]{#calibre_link-525}One must realize the ultimate truth dependent upon
the conventional, but abandon all[]{#calibre_link-2471} of these
necessarily conventional designations as characterizations of an
ultimate nature that is ultimately
uncharacterizable.[]{#calibre_link-799}[^140^](#calibre_link-267){.nounder}

The anticipation of Wittgenstein's close of the *Tractatus* is
remarkable:

6.54 My propositions serve as elucidations in the following way: anyone
who understands me eventually recognizes them as nonsensical, when he
has used them---as steps---to climb beyond them.
(He[]{#calibre_link-2472} must, so to speak, throw away the ladder after
he has climbed up it.)

7 What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence.

Nāgārjuna may well have intended (and of course we have no way of
knowing what he intended, nor would it make much difference to
interpretation at this point) both readings---the standard reading at
the conventional[]{#calibre_link-2473} level, according to which the
truth of his own standpoint contrasts with all other false views, and
this latter reading at the ultimate level, at which his own view must
itself be seen as a merely conventional ostention of an ineffable
ultimate truth.[]{#calibre_link-800}[^141^](#calibre_link-268){.nounder}
And if the doctrine of the two truths and their identity is correct,
these readings are mutually entailing. To assert
[]{#calibre_link-2474}from the conventional
standpoint[]{#calibre_link-2475} that all phenomena are empty and that
all views according to which they are not are to be relinquished is to
recognize from the ultimate standpoint that there are no phenomena to be
empty and that no view attributing any characteristic to anything can be
maintained. Even the emptiness of emptiness is empty. . . .

May whatever merit has been achieved through this work and through its
study be[]{#calibre_link-2476} dedicated to the liberation of all
sentient beings from cyclic existence.[]{#calibre_link-2477}

[]{#calibre_link-101}[2.](#calibre_link-557){.nounder} It cannot be
overemphasized that as far as Nāgārjuna---or any Mahāyāna Buddhist
philosopher, for that matter---is concerned, the view that the things we
perceive and of which we conceive, to the extent that they exist at all,
do so inherently originates as an innate
misapprehension[]{#calibre_link-2568} and is not the product of
sophisticated philosophical theory. That is, we naively and
pretheoretically take things as substantial. This, as Nāgārjuna will
argue, and as the Buddha himself argued, is the root delusion that lies
at the basis of all human suffering. We can, to be sure, make
sophisticated philosophy out of this. And much[]{#calibre_link-2569} of
Western and Asian metaphysics is devoted to that enterprise. But it is
important to see that an intellectual rejection of that sophisticated
essentialist metaphysics would not, from the standpoint of Buddhism,
suffice for liberation from suffering. For the innate
misapprehension---the root delusion enshrined in common sense and in
much of our language---would remain. Nā[]{#calibre_link-2570}gārjuna's
text is aimed primarily against philosophy. But its soteriological goal
is the extirpation of the very root of suffering.

end, as we shall see, ultimate reality depends on our conventions in a
way, it depends on our conventions in a very different way from that in
which conventional reality does. Despite this difference in the
structure of the relation between convention and reality in the two
cases, however, it remains a distinctive feature of
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2573}rjuna's system that it is impossible to speak
coherently of reality independent of conventions.

[]{#calibre_link-103}[4.](#calibre_link-560){.nounder} I have generally
translated the Tibetan *"rang bzhin"* (Skt: *svabhāva)* with the English
philosophical term "essence," as opposed to the more traditional
"self-nature" or "own-being" used by many Buddhologists. (Here I agree
with Cabezon \[1992\].) I think that this best[]{#calibre_link-2574}
captures Nāgārjuna's usage, and this choice makes good etymological
sense as well. But there are dangers here. *"Rang bzhin"* and
*"svabhāva"* have their semantic homes in Buddhist philosophical
literature, and their ordinary meanings derive from their usage in that
environment. "Essence" has it semantic home[]{#calibre_link-2575} in the
Western philosophical tradition. So there will no doubt be resonances of
the original terms that are not captured by the translation and new
resonances introduced that would be foreign to the original text. But
this is unavoidable in a translation. Retaining the original term is
worse, as it conveys nothing to the reader not already conversant with
Tibetan, Sanskrit, and Buddhist philosophy.[]{#calibre_link-2576} And
using one of the ugly neologisms frequently introduced conveys the
misleading impression that the original introduces such an ugly
neologism. In the interest of not cluttering this text with philological
footnotes, I will not generally defend my choices as I do here. But I do
remind the reader of this and of any translation: *Caveat lector!* A
great deal of interpretation goes into any translation.

in this example hinges on the fact that the table is an artifact. The
same points could be made about the tree from which its wood was hewn.
The boundaries of the tree, both spatial and temporal (consider the
junctures between root and soil, or leaf and air; between live and dead
wood; between seed, shoot, and tree); its identity over time (each year
it sheds its leaves and[]{#calibre_link-2580} grows new ones; some limbs
break; new limbs grow); its existence as a unitary object, as opposed to
a collection of cells; etc., are all conventional. Removing its
properties leaves no core bearer behind. Searching for the tree that is
independent of and which is the bearer of its parts, we come up empty. I
thank Graham Parkes for pointing out the need to stress this point.

with whom I have discussed this interpretation argue that there is no
real difference between causes and conditions, some that a cause is one
kind of condition, some that efficient causes are causes and all other
causal factors contributing to an event are conditions. Some like my
reading. I have found no unanimity on this interpretive question, either
among Western Buddhologists[]{#calibre_link-2597} or among Tibetan
scholars. The canonical texts are equivocal as well. I do not argue that
the distinction I here attribute to Nāgārjuna, which I defend on
hermeneutical grounds, is necessarily drawn in the same way throughout
the Buddhist philosophical world or even throughout the
Prāsaṅ[]{#calibre_link-2598}gika-Mādhyamika literature. But it is the
one Nāgārjuna draws.

translate *"stob"* (Skt: *bāla* or *shakti)* and to translate *"bya-ba"*

[]{#calibre_link-117}[16](#calibre_link-582){.nounder}. There are two
kinds of cases to be made for attributing this distinction to Nāgārjuna
in this chapter: Most generally, there is the hermeneutical argument
that this makes the best philosophical sense of the text. It gets
Nāgārjuna drawing a distinction that is clearly
suggested[]{#calibre_link-2602} by his philosophical outlook and that
lines up nicely with the technical terms he deploys. But we can get more
textually fine grained as well; in the first verse, Nāgārjuna explicitly
rejects the existence of efficacy and pointedly uses the word "cause."
He denies that there are such things. Nowhere in Chapter I is there a
parallel denial[]{#calibre_link-2603} of the existence of conditions. On
the contrary, in I: 2 he positively asserts that there are four kinds of
them. To be sure, this could be read as a mere partitioning of the class
of effects that are described in Buddhist literature. But there are two
reasons not to read it thus: First, Nāgārjuna does not couch the
assertion in one of[]{#calibre_link-2604} his "it might be said"
locutions. Second, he never takes it back. The positive tone the text
takes regarding conditions is continued in I: 4--5, where Nāgārjuna
asserts that conditions are conceived without efficacy in contrast with
the causes rejected in Chapter I and where he endorses a regularist view
of conditions. So it seems that Nā[]{#calibre_link-2605}gārjuna does use
the "cause"/"condition" distinction to mark a distinction between the
kind of association he endorses as an analysis of dependent arising and
one he rejects. Inada (1970) among Western commentators agrees with this
interpretation. Kalupahana (1986) seems to as well (see pp. 34--35). But
see Streng (1973) and Wood (1994) for a contrasting
interpretation,[]{#calibre_link-2606} according to which Nāgārjuna is
out to reject causes and conditions in the same sense, and according to
which the distinction between the four conditions provides a platform
for an exhaustive refutation of production with no positive account of
interdependence implicated. This latter interpretation is adopted by
Tsong Khapa (Sarnath ed.,[]{#calibre_link-2607} pp. 12ff.) and his
followers as well. They attribute a like view to Candrakīrti. But I
would disagree at that point with their reading of Candrakīrti's text.

(personal communication) notes that the understanding of the nature of
percept-object conditions and dominant conditions in Māhāyana Buddhist
philosophy undergoes a significant transformation a few centuries later
at the hands of Dignaga and Dharmakīrti and that
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2618}rjuna is here making use of older
Sarvastivādan understandings of these terms to demonstrate the emptiness
of conditions so understood.

[]{#calibre_link-124}[23](#calibre_link-593){.nounder}. Wood (1994)
argues (see esp. pp. 48--53, pp. 63--64) that Nāgārjuna here argues that
nothing arises at all. He claims that the argument begins by providing
an exhaustive[]{#calibre_link-2619} enumeration of the ways in which a
thing could arise and then proceeds to eliminate each of these. This
analysis, however, is problematic on two counts: First, it ignores the
distinction between conventional, dependently arisen phenomena and
inherently existent phenomena. To say that inherently existent phenomena
cannot arise in any way, or that there can be no inherently existent
production, is[]{#calibre_link-2620} not thereby to say that there is no
conventional dependency, or that there are no dependently arisen
phenomena. Second, Wood ignores the positive account of dependence on
conditions presented in this chapter. His interpretations of the various
commentaries that he cites in defense of this nihilistic reading are
similarly marked by inattention to this set of distinctions, which I
(and many others,[]{#calibre_link-2621} including both canonical and
modern interpreters) argue are crucial to understanding this text. Wood
says, "If Nāgārjuna wished to avoid the nihilistic conclusion that
things do not originate *period,* he would never have said in 1.1a that
things do not arise. Furthermore, he would either have had to specify
the way that things *do* arise,[]{#calibre_link-2622} but in some
*miraculous* or *inexplicable* way" (p. 63 \[emphasis in original\]).
But on my reading at I: 1, Nāgārjuna does not say that things do not
arise period. He simply says that they do not arise by means of an
inherently existent causal process. And he does both here and in
subsequent chapters explain how things arise in a
decidedly[]{#calibre_link-2623} nonmiraculous way.

But see Nagao (1989) for an interpretation in accord with my own:

"Dependent co-arising refers to a causal relationship wherein no essence
is present at any time in either cause or result. Thus the sentence
'Nothing arises from itself; nothing arises from another,' is not
intended to refute arising. It is a negation of others that might be
explained as 'from themselves' or[]{#calibre_link-2624} 'from others.' "

Tuck (1990) has noted, a current fashion of using Wittgenstein to
explicate Nāgārjuna and other Mādhyamika philosophers. Most (e.g.
Huntington \[1983a, 1983b, 1989\], Gudmunson \[1977\], and Thurman
\[1984\]) emphasize connections to the *Philosophical Investigations*,
indeed with good reason. But[]{#calibre_link-2631} (as Waldo \[1975,
1978\] and Anderson \[1985\] as well as Garfield \[1990, 1994,

exegesis, particularly of Nāgārjuna's work. Tractarian ideas also inform
my discussion of Nāgārjuna on positionlessness, the
limits[]{#calibre_link-2632} of expressibility, and the relation between
the two truths below. None of this, however, should be taken either as
implying that Nāgārjuna would agree with everything in the *Tractatus*
(assuredly he would not) or that the parallels drawn between Mādhyamika
philosophy and themes in the *Philosophical
Investigations*[]{#calibre_link-2633} are spurious. They are in fact

position implies that we should seek to explain regularities by
reference to their embeddedness in other regularities, and so on. To ask
why there are regularities at all, on such a view, would be to ask an
incoherent question: The fact of explanatorily useful regularities in
nature is what makes explanation and investigation possible in the
first[]{#calibre_link-2638} place and is not something itself that can
be explained. After all, there is only one universe, and truly singular
phenomena, on such a view, are inexplicable in principle. This may
connect deeply to the Buddha's insistence that questions concerning the
beginning of the world are unanswerable.

very often translated and interpreted in a diametrically opposed way:
"Since things exist without essence the assertion 'When this exists,

Inada (1970), Streng (1967), Sprung (1979), and Kalupahana (1986). They
may be suggested by Candrakīrti's comments[]{#calibre_link-2643} to the
effect that this phrase would make no sense were it asserted by the
realist. But such a translation is not supported by the dialectical
structure of the chapter and forces an excessively negative
interpretation on the chapter as a whole. Moreover, as we shall see in
Chapter XXIV, this would entail an untenable absolutism with respect to
the ultimate truth and a corresponding untenable
nihilism[]{#calibre_link-2644} with respect to the conventional world.
But see Nagao (1989) for a better reading:

The meaning of the traditional expressions "dependent upon this," or "if
this exists then that exists" is not that when one essence exists, then
some other essence exists apart from it. On the contrary, it is because
both this and that do not exist as essences that, when this exists, then
that also exists. (p. 7)

with the Ven. Geshe Yeshes Thap-Khas on this point since Nāgārjuna
offers perfectly general arguments against change in properties. And it
would seem especially[]{#calibre_link-2649} elegant for Nāgārjuna, who
is attacking the tendency to reify, to begin with the two properties
most subject to reification in Buddhist philosophy, in virtue of their
universal applicability to phenomena and centrality to the Buddhist
metaphysical framework---dependent arising and change. While the
canonical commentaries I have consulted[]{#calibre_link-2650} do not

Hume shows that only the reified substantialist versions of objects and

perceptual and cognitive commerce,[]{#calibre_link-2659} on his view,
are perfectly existent, but only in virtue of being dependent upon
conventions ("custom") for their identity and existence. It is a clear
analysis of their conventional character that allows us to coherently
assert their existence.

(literally "heaps" or "piles," but most often translated as
"aggregates") are the basic constituents of the personality. Five are
typically identified: form (really matter---the physical body),
sensation, perception, disposition (behavioral and cognitive), and
consciousness. But the term *"skandha"* indicates two features of this
decomposition that must be born in mind to avoid
confusion:[]{#calibre_link-2668} The division is practical and
empirical, and not philosophically principled, and the *skandhas*
themselves are decomposible into further heaps, etc. These are not,
hence, ontological fundamentals, but rather the first level of a
psychology.

this second possibility is the possible presence of an idealist in the

understand "form" in this context to designate physical reality as a
whole, including matter and energy. We can presume (bypassing
hagiographie considerations) that Nāgārjuna was unaware of the
relativistic understanding of the interchangeability of these two; but
it is clear that, from the standpoint of "*skandha*
theory,"[]{#calibre_link-2675} the operative contrast is between the
physical and the nonphysical. (And here, given the antisubstantial
metaphysics in play, "nonphysical" does not mean made of spook stuff.)
Form is just whatever is succeptible of physical description and
explanation. Many kinds of supervenience are compatible with the
decomposition suggested by Buddhist psychology.

The argument in favor of dependence is experience. Hence, the person
presenting a refutation of this idea should be in a position not only to
negate "mutual dependence" but also to provide evidence for the
establishment of a metaphysical substance (svabhāva). This has not yet
been achieved.[]{#calibre_link-2680} Thus, according to Nāgārjuna, what
still remains to be proved is the thesis regarding "substance" rather
than mutual dependence.

While this analysis is consistent with Kalupahana's interpretation of
Nāgārjuna as a pragmatically inclined empiricist, I do not see it as an
accurate[]{#calibre_link-2681} rendering of the argument here. In
particular, it ignores the emphasis on emptiness in these verses.

This term is sometimes appropriately translated as "disposition,"
"action," or "compounded." Context is crucial in determining which
rendering is best. In Buddhist metaphysics these meanings are closely
connected. Kalupahana (1986) uses "conditioned," though he interprets
this to mean "conditioned by dispositions." He argues that this chapter
is closely connected to the previous[]{#calibre_link-2689} chapter in
that lust "is operative in the perceptual process especially in the
formation of ideas derived from experience." He argues that this chapter
is devoted to an examination of the way phenomena such as desire
determine the formation of ideas from "the blooming, buzzing confusion"
of sense experience (p. 159). I find this reading unsupported by the

would not want to say that sometimes dependent arising is arising,
sometimes abiding, sometimes ceasing. The whole Buddhist picture of
impermanence is one according to which these processes are always
co-occurring. But this dialectical move is not available to Nāgārjuna at
this stage of the discussion. It would beg the[]{#calibre_link-2692}
question in a critical sense: The properties under analysis here, as
well as dependent arising itself, are introduced by the opponent as
candidates for inherent existence and as components of an analysis of
the ultimate nature of phenomena. In the sense that they are deployed in
a positive Buddhist account of the nature of conventional reality---the
sense in which all phenomena are constantly
arising[]{#calibre_link-2693} in some sense, abiding through change in
another, and ceasing in yet another---neither the phenomena to which
these predicates are applied, nor the properties ascribed, are
inherently existent. Quite the contrary; this is an analysis that is
designed to demonstrate the lack of inherent existence of phenomena and
their characteristics. It is important throughout the discussion that
follows to bear[]{#calibre_link-2694} in mind that Nāgārjuna is not
subjecting this view to criticism, but its substantialist cousin.

philosophy, the entire phenomenal world is referred to as cyclic
existence (′*khor-ba*, Skt: *samsāra)*. This term indicates not only the
endless cycle of birth and death posited by the Buddhist doctrine of
rebirth, but also the universally cyclic character of phenomena:
Perception and action form a cycle; motivation and action form a cycle;
the seasons[]{#calibre_link-2719} are cyclic; chains of interdependence
of phenomena are cyclic; interpersonal relations are cyclic; craving and
acquisition are cyclic. It is this metaphor, suggesting that all of
unenlightened existence amounts to going around in circles despite the
illusion of progress, that most poignantly captures the sense in which
all of human existence is suffering. See Sogyal Rinpoche 1992, pp.

simply as a discussion of the problem of the beginning of personal
existence and as an argument to the effect that cyclic existence and the
predicament of suffering is beginningless, or at least that it is
pointless[]{#calibre_link-2721} or impossible to discuss and ponder its
beginning. On the other hand, given the parallels between the analysis
here and that in Chapter XXVII, where the questions concerning the
finitude or infinitude of personal existence and of the world's
existence are explicitly juxtaposed and receive identical treatment,
there is good reason to see this chapter as implicitly addressing both
as well.

(Walsh, trans., 1987, p. 164)

There are three popular readings of the Buddha's refusal to answer the
"unanswerable[]{#calibre_link-2725} questions." On one reading this was
an example of his great skill in teaching; any answer he would have
given would have been misconstrued and would have had adverse
consequences for the student. On another reading, by refusing to answer,
the Buddha was indicating that asking these questions does not conduce
to successful practice of the Buddhist path and that one should focus
one's mind[]{#calibre_link-2726} on more soteriologically efficacious
issues. On a third reading---the one adopted here---these questions are
in fact metaphysically misguided. They all involve incoherent
essentialist presuppositions that, when rejected, render the questions
meaningless.

[]{#calibre_link-177}[66](#calibre_link-671){.nounder}. The Buddha
pronounced unanswerable questions regarding whether the world has an
origin or an end in time or space, whether the individual
continues[]{#calibre_link-2727} to exist after entering nirvāṇa, whether
there is some entity that transmigrates, and whether there is temporal
beginning or end to the continuum of consciousness. Kant pronounces
unanswerable questions regarding the substantiality, simplicity,
personal identity, and primacy of the self, as well as questions
regarding the finiteness or infinitude[]{#calibre_link-2728} of the
world in space and time, the ultimate divisibility of the world, the
freedom of the will, and the existence of God. Murti (1985) makes a bit
too much of this parallel, however, arguing that Nāgārjuna follows Kant
in asserting that

the aim in cosmological speculation (Rational Cosmology) is to reach the
unconditioned ground of[]{#calibre_link-2729} empirical objects by means
of a regressive claim of reasoning (i.e. arguing from effect to cause)
stretched illegitimately, as Kant points out, beyond the possibility of
experience....

The question regarding the *Tathāgata* is in fact about the ultimate
ground of both the soul and objects---about the unconditioned in
general. The *Tathāgata*[]{#calibre_link-2730} as the Perfect Man is the
ultimate essence of the universe. His position is analogous to that of
God of Rational Theology....

The formulation of the problems in the thesis-antithesis form is itself
evidence of the conflict in Reason, that the conflict is not on the
empirical level and so not capable of being settled by appeal to facts
is realized by the Buddha when he declares them
unsoluble..."[]{#calibre_link-2731} (pp. xiii-xv).

While Nāgārjuna shares with Kant a critical approach to
philosophy---each seeks to limn the bounds of thought---and while Kant
posits an unconditioned realm that is the unknowable but necessary
ground of the empirical world, Nāgārjuna eschews just such a ground.
His[]{#calibre_link-2732} treatment of the unanswerable questions, then,
differs from Kant's, despite the many genuine parallels, in that while
for Kant the antinomies represent the application of concepts beyond
their range, for Nāgārjuna they represent sheer nonsense: These
antinomies are not for him insoluble problems, but rather pairs of
apparently coherent[]{#calibre_link-2733} but in fact nonsensical verbal
formulations.

however, take this to mean that for Nāgārjuna there is an inherently
existent continuum out of which we carve the merely conventional. Rather
just as any totality is dependent upon its parts, the totality of
empirical reality depends upon its empty components and, so, is itself
empty. Ontology presupposes conventional[]{#calibre_link-2736}
categories. Nor is this to say that the conventions we adopt are from
our perspective arbitrary. They reflect our needs, our biological,
psychological, perceptual, and social characteristics, as well as our
languages and customs. Given these constraints and conventions, there
are indeed facts of the matter regarding empirical claims and regarding
the meanings of words. But there is no
transcendent[]{#calibre_link-2737} standpoint, Nāgārjuna would insist,
from which these conventions and constraints can be seen as justified.

(1986) translates this term (Skt: *samskāra,* Tib: *'du byed)* as
"dispositions." That is often correct. But it can also refer to
compounded phenomena in general. Given the structure of the argument in
this chapter, I (as do Tsong Khapa and his followers) prefer this
reading. Kalupahana (p. 48) argues that it makes sense to follow a
chapter on suffering[]{#calibre_link-2742} with one on dispositions,
inasmuch as the latter plausibly give rise to the former. He is right.
But it also makes sense to follow a chapter on suffering with one on
compounded phenomena since positing them as self-existent is what gives
rise to suffering. Dispositions and compounded phenomena are---as the
homonymy in question demonstrates---closely linked in Buddhist
metaphysics. Dispositions are themselves[]{#calibre_link-2743}
compounded phenomena; but more importantly, they are what lead us to the
conceptual compounding that gives phenomena their status as conventional
entities.

characteristic of all phenomena (including itself) and, hence, like
them, is conventionally real. See also Siderits (1989).

puts this point nicely: "Criticism of theories is no theory. Criticism
is but the awareness of what a theory is, how it is made up, it is not
the proposing of a new theory. Negation of positions is not one more
position" (p. xxiii).

See also Siderits (1989) for an interesting discussion of the connection
between Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2752}rjuna's claim to positionlessness and
contemporary antirealism. Siderits puts the point this way:

\[Nāgārjuna\] neither asserts nor intimates any claims about the
ultimate nature of reality, for he takes the very notion of a way that
the world is independently of our cognitive activity to be devoid of
meaning. ... The slogan 'The ultimate[]{#calibre_link-2753} truth is
that there is no ultimate truth' is merely a striking way of putting the
point that an acceptable canon of rationality will have to reflect human
needs, interest, and institutions. (p. 6)

I am neither completely comfortable with Siderits's construction of the
contemporary realism-antirealism debate nor with his location of
Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2754}rjuna on the antirealist side. (I rather think
that Nāgārjuna would reject the presupposition of that debate---that the
relevant sense of "real" is coherent in the first place.) But the
connection he establishes between positionlessness and the rejection of
a realist ontology is instructive.

All of this will become much more explicit (if[]{#calibre_link-2755} not
much clearer) in the discussions in XXII, XXIV, XXV, and XXVII below. I
discuss this at greater length in Garfield (unpublished).

[]{#calibre_link-188}[75.](#calibre_link-685){.nounder} Ng (1993),
however, argues that this verse should be read "all false views." So he
claims that, according to Nāgārjuna, to understand emptiness is to
relinquish all false views and that anyone who[]{#calibre_link-2756}
holds false views about emptiness is incurable. But Nāgārjuna doesn't
say this, and the interpretation seems unfounded. See pp. 18-25.

intelligible. Nāgārjuna spends a good deal of time developing quite
lucid analyses of conventional phenomena and their relation to
emptiness. What fails to be intelligible is, rather, the idea of
inherent existence. But since no phenomena exist that
way,[]{#calibre_link-2758} and since emptiness is intelligible, the
actual nature of phenomena is intelligible.

"compounded phenomena," rather than, as Kalupahana (1986) does,
"dispositions." This follows the Tibetan commentarial tradition and
makes better sense of the argument.

sentient beings---to enhance one's knowledge, skill, and compassion so

Nāgārjuna intends to deny these four possibilities. See also Sprung
(1979) and Wood (1994) for interpretations that fail to appreciate
completely the positive tetralemma and its role in
Nāgārjuna's[]{#calibre_link-2791} enterprise (though to be sure Wood
takes note of the positive mood of this instance). Ruegg (1977)
interprets this verse as suggesting gradations of progressively more
sophisticated teachings---progressing from a mundane analysis of
existence to a teaching of emptiness, to a teaching of their
compatibility, to an indication of the inability of predication. Ng
(1993), pp. 93-97, agrees. While such[]{#calibre_link-2792} a purport
would be something with which Nāgārjuna would agree, it seems out of
place in this discussion. Wood, on the other hand, takes this verse to
indicate that straightforward contradictions (existence and
nonexistence) follow from the supposition that anything exists at all,
in any way, and, hence, to form part of a nihilistic
analysis.[]{#calibre_link-2793} While such a reading would make sense if
one only attended to this chapter, taken in the context of the work as a
whole, and especially Chapter XXIV, that nihilistic reading is very hard
to sustain.

tetralemma when emphasizing claims about conventional phenomena and to
negative forms when emphasizing the impossibility of the literal

issue with philosophers such as Sprung (1979), who argue that the
tetralemma is insignificant for Mādhyamika thought. Indeed, as I
indicate in several places in this commentary, it is, both in its
positive and negative moods, often an indispensable analytic tool. It is
indeed "used as a means of investigation" (p. 7) here and
elsewhere[]{#calibre_link-2797} in the text. And as I argue here and
below it is often quite useful. Sprung may be led to this conclusion by
the fact that he overlooks the contrast between positive and negative
tetralemmas, focusing exclusively on the latter. Moreover, he confuses
its logical structure. See Ruegg (1977) and Matilal (1977) for divergent
but each interesting and helpful investigations into the structure of
the[]{#calibre_link-2798} tetralemma, as well as Wood (1994) for what I

"whenever we examine physical, mental, or abstract entities, we find as

fundamental teaching of Mādhyamika." See also Nagao (1989),
pp.[]{#calibre_link-2801} 67--68, for useful remarks on XVIII: 7--9. But
this interpretation can be carried too far, with the consequence that
Nāgārjuna is seen as a thoroughgoing Kantian absolutist regarding the
ultimate truth. Murti (1985) endorses just such a view:

Origination, decay, etc...are imagined by the uninformed; they are
speculations indulged in by the[]{#calibre_link-2802} ignorant. The real
is utterly devoid *(śūnya)* of these and other conceptual constructions;
it is transcendent to thought and can be realised only in nondual
knowledge---*prajñā* or Intuition, which is the Absolute itself....The
distinction between two truths, *Paramārtha* and *Samvrti,* is
emphasised....

... It as generally accepted[]{#calibre_link-2803} \[by Nāgārjuna and
his followers\] that the real is Absolute, at once Transcendent of
Empirical Determinations and Immanent \[in\] Phenomena as the innermost
essence. (p. xi \[capitalization in original\])

Kalupahana (1986) adopts another extreme reading, arguing that this
verse in fact says nothing about the character of reality, but
rather[]{#calibre_link-2804} "the means by which a conception of truth
is arrived at." He argues that it merely admonishes one to be
independent in one's thinking, unbiased and calm in one's philosophical
inquiry. It is hard to see how this reading could be justified apart
from a strong antecedent commitment to seeing Nāgārjuna as a pragmatist.

existence of properties, including emptiness or nonemptiness, or of
individuals, as the semantic values of predicates or subject terms,
respectively, arguing for a more pragmatic view of linguistic meaning.
Huntington (1989) emphasizes this point as well. I discuss this issue at
greater[]{#calibre_link-2819} length in connection with the
interpretation of *Vigrahavyāvartanī* in Garfield (unpublished).

instance, the comments of Murti (1985) on this verse:

The *paramārtha,* however, can be understood and realized only
negatively, *only as we remove the saṇvṛti,* the forms which thought has
already, unconsciously and beginninglessly, ascribed to the real. The
real is to be *uncovered, discovered and realized*
as[]{#calibre_link-2829} the reality of appearances. In the order of our
discovery, the removal of *saṇvṛti* must precede our knowledge of the
*paramārtha.* (p. xxvi \[emphasis in the original\]).

As we shall see, this analysis of the distinction between the two truths
as an appearance/reality distinction is explicitly rejected by
Nā[]{#calibre_link-2830}gārjuna in XXIV: 18, 19.1 agree with Kalupahana
(1986), who notes that *"ārtha* as well as *paramārtha* are truths
*(satya).* The former is not presented as an un-truth *(a-satya)* in
relation to the latter, as it would be in an absolutistic tradition.
Neither is the former sublated by the latter." But
Kalupahana[]{#calibre_link-2831} goes a bit too far when he continues,
"There is no indication whatsoever that these are two truths with
different standing as higher and lower" (p. 69). For there is clearly an
important sense in which, despite their ontic unity, the ultimate truth
is epistemologically and soteriologically more significant than the
conventional. Kalupahana also errs in my view when he characterizes the
two truths[]{#calibre_link-2832} as "two fruits" and, hence, as
different but complementary moral ideals (p. 332). In his zeal to see
Nāgārjuna as a non-Mahāyāna philosopher and as a Jamesian pragmatist, I
fear that he distorts the central epistemological and metaphysical
themes of the text.

[]{#calibre_link-233}[109.](#calibre_link-743){.nounder} It
should[]{#calibre_link-2833} be noted that both Sanskrit and Tibetan
offer two terms, each of which in turn is often translated "conventional
truth." Sanskrit presents *"samvṛti-satya"* and *"vyavahā* *ra-satya.* "
The former is delightfully ambiguous. *"Saṃvṛti"* can mean
*conventional* in all of its normal senses---everyday, by
agreement,[]{#calibre_link-2834} ordinary, etc. But it can also mean
*concealing,* or *occluding.* This ambiguity is exploited by Mādhyamika
philosophers, who emphasize that the conventional, in occluding its
conventional character, covers up its own emptiness.

Candrakīrti's commentary to this verse distinguishes three readings,
reflecting three distinct etymologies: *"Saṃvṛ[]{#calibre_link-2835}ti"*
can mean concealing; it can mean mutually dependent; it can mean
transactional, or dependent on linguistic convention. The latter is
captured exactly by the second term *"vyavahāra,*" which simply means
transactional---determined by convention. Tibetan presents not only
*"kun-rdzob bden-pa,*" which literally means costumed, or disguised,
picking up on one of the meanings[]{#calibre_link-2836} of *"saṇvṛti,* "
but *"tha-snyed bden-pa,"* which means nominal, or by agreement, picking
up the other meaning. Because these two Tibetan terms are, according to
most Tibetan interpretations of Mādhyamika, identical in extension, they
are often treated as synonymous. This is a bit unfortunate for when we
come to the parallel[]{#calibre_link-2837} pair of terms for
conventional existents, *"kun-rdzob yod-pa"* and *"tha-snyed yod-pa,"*
this coextension breaks down in an important case: emptiness is a
nominal *(tha snyed)* existent, but not a concealing *(kun-rdzob)*
existent.

See Nagao (1989), pp. 40-59, and (1991), pp. 13-16, for additional
discussion of the Sanskrit etymologies and of the sense in which the
conventional truth is a truth.

Kalupahana[]{#calibre_link-2838} (1986), however, argues (p. 88) that
whenever Nāgārjuna uses the terms *"samvṛti"* or *"vyavahāra,"* he "was
referring to moral conventions of good or bad." He argues that the
relation between the two truths is a relation between an ideal life and
conventional morality. This claim about[]{#calibre_link-2839} usage,
however, seems just plain erroneous.

(1973), pp. 92-98, and Huntington (1989), pp. 48-50, for a similar
analysis. (But Huntington places a bit too much emphasis on specifically
social convention in his analysis of the conventional truth, neglecting
the role of what the Mādhyamikas call "primal ignorance," or the "innate
disposition to reify," embodied in our ordinary cognitive
tendencies,[]{#calibre_link-2842} which may, in fact, be ontogenetically
more fundamental than the specifically social conventions to which they
give rise and that then reinforce them. See esp. pp. 52-54.) This
analysis contrasts sharply with Murti's (1973) assertion that "the
Absolute \[ultimate truth\] is transcendent to thought ... phenomena in
their essential form" (p. 9). This view of the ultimate truth as an
absolute standing[]{#calibre_link-2843} behind, or in opposition to, a
relative truth of the conventional, as a Kantian noumenal world stands
to a phenomenal world, is quite contrary to Nāgārjuna's doctrine of the
emptiness of emptiness. See also Murti (1955) for an extended defense of
this reading and Sprung (1973), esp. pp. 43-46, for another argument for
a radical discontinuity[]{#calibre_link-2844} between the two truths.
Tola and Dragonetti (1981) agree with this view of Mādhyamika as
nihilistic with regard to the conventional truth: "As a consequence of
their argumentation and analysis, the Mādhyamikas deny the existence of
the empirical reality, of all of its manifestations. . . .

As a result ... there remains (we are obliged[]{#calibre_link-2845} to
say) 'something' completely different. ... That 'something' is the true
reality" (p. 276). Crittenden (1981) is in substantial agreement with
this view.

Curiously, even Nagao seems to succumb to this temptation to absolutize
emptiness when he turns to his analysis of the ultimate truth, despite
his emphasis on the identity of the two truths when he is elucidating
the conventional. See Nagao[]{#calibre_link-2846} (1989), pp. 71-72,
75-76.

[]{#calibre_link-236}[112.](#calibre_link-748){.nounder} Wood (1994) on
p. 202 says that he is

unable to find anything in MK 24 to support \[the non-nihilistic\]
interpretation of MK 24.7-11. ... According to \[the non-nihilistic
interpretation\], we would have to read MMK 24 as follows. According to
Nāgārjuna, the doctrine[]{#calibre_link-2849} that everything is void
does not mean that everything is unreal or nonexistent; it only means
that everything is empty in the sense that everything arises and
perishes through a process of dependent co-origination
(*pratītya-samutpāda)*; and the critic must be taken as criticizing this
position.

Wood then argues correctly that no Buddhist opponent would criticize
the[]{#calibre_link-2850} doctrine of dependent co-origination. This is
in fact the cornerstone of Wood's nihilistic reading of the text, as it
must be. For this chapter clinches the non-nihilistic interpretation.
So, a few things deserve note: While Wood cannot find anything in this
chapter to support such a reading, commentators including both
Buddhapālita and Bhā[]{#calibre_link-2851}vaviveka, as well as
Candrakīrti and Tsong Khapa, not to mention a host of modern Western and
Tibetan scholars, have found quite a bit there. Nāgārjuna's disciple
Āryadeva also insists in *Catuḥsātaka* on a non-nihilistic reading of
emptiness. In fact Wood does have the necessary
gloss[]{#calibre_link-2852} on the verses in question just right. But he
misses the position attributed to the opponent entirely. The opponent
need not be represented as denying that phenomena are codependently
originated. Rather the opponent is failing to see that that dependent
co-origination is emptiness. He hence sees the attribution of emptiness
as the denial, rather than the assertion, of codependent origination.
Hence[]{#calibre_link-2853} the entire remainder of the chapter is
devoted not to arguing for emptiness, nor to arguing for the reality of
codependent origination, but rather to arguing for their identity. To
miss this is to miss the entire point of the text.

(1994), pp. 115-16, for a dramatically different reading (of the
parallel verse in *Vigrahavyāvartanī*---but the points all go over) of
this verse. Wood interprets emptiness as complete nonexistence and reads
Nāgārjuna as a thoroughgoing nihilist. So he interprets
Nā[]{#calibre_link-2858}gārjuna as asserting that if one sees
conventional phenomena as real in any way, one is in trouble and that
philosophical problems vanish only if one sees all apparent phenomena as
illusions. In offering this interpretation, Wood notes that Nāgārjuna
often characterizes phenomena as like dreams or
mirages.[]{#calibre_link-2859} That is indeed so, but his interpretation
of that simile is itself problematic. For a thing to be like a mirage or
a dream is for it to exist in one way (as, e.g., a mirage), but to not
exist in the way that it appears (as water). To put the point another
way: Mirages *really are* mirages, but are *not* really water, though
they might *appear* to be. So conventional phenomena, according to the
simile,[]{#calibre_link-2860} *really are* empty, dependently arisen,
nominally real phenomena, but are *not* substantial, inherently existent
phenomena, though they might *appear* to be. So, pace Wood, it is not
Nāgārjuna, but his opponent who is the nihilist here. See also Padhye
(1988), esp. pp. 61-66, for a good critical discussion of the nihilistic
reading.

is succumbing to the very view that Nāgārjuna criticizes here---the view
that to exist is to exist inherently and that to not exist inherently is
not to exist at all. The non-nihilistic[]{#calibre_link-2863} sense of
"does not exist" is in play when Nāgārjuna, in providing a reductio on
the opponent's view, is taking inherent existence as the meaning of
"existence." Given that understanding, Nāgārjuna can quite easily say
that, e.g., the self does not exist while retaining his
commitment[]{#calibre_link-2864} to its conventional existence. He can
also say that no inherently existent phenomena exist at all without
denying the conventional existence of conventional phenomena.

[]{#calibre_link-241}[117.](#calibre_link-757){.nounder} His Holiness
the Dalai Lama, in oral remarks (Columbia University 1994), says:

Since dependent co-origination is used as a premise to argue for the
lack of inherent existence of things, it can't be independent of it.
Lack of inherent existence must always be understood as negative and
as[]{#calibre_link-2867} a feature of conventional reality... In
*Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* these two truths---dependent co-origination and
emptiness---are taught as two perspectives on the same reality.

[]{#calibre_link-242}[118.](#calibre_link-758){.nounder} See Nagao
(1991), pp. 190-94, for a useful discussion of alternative renderings of
this compound and of the interpretive issues raised in
translating[]{#calibre_link-2868} it. Nagao himself opts for "a
designation based upon (some material)." I find this both awkward and
misleading; it commits Nāgārjuna univocally to "some material" as the
designative basis for emptiness, submerging the metalinguistic reading.
Both seem to me to be clearly intended by the text.

[]{#calibre_link-243}[119.](#calibre_link-759){.nounder} Compare to
Murti (1973):

Relativity[]{#calibre_link-2869} or mutual dependence is a mark of the
unreal.... For the Mādhyamika, reciprocity, dependence, is the lack of
inner essence. *Tattva,* or the Real, is something in itself,
self-evident, and self-existent. Reason, which understands things
through distinction and relation is a principle of falsity, as it
distorts and thereby hides the Real. Only the Absolute as the
unconditioned[]{#calibre_link-2870} is real.... (p. 16) This represents
as clear a statement as one would like of the position that the
conventional/ultimate distinction is a version of an appearance/reality
or phenomenon/noumenon distinction, a position I read Nāgārjuna as at
pains to refute. As Murti says later in this essay (p. 22), "I have
interpreted śū[]{#calibre_link-2871}nyatā and the doctrine of the Two
Truths as a kind of Absolutism, not Nihilism. Nāgārjuna's 'no views
about reality' should not be taken as advocating a 'no-reality view.' "

Nagao (1991) concurs with Murti on this point: "The Twofold Truth is
composed of paramārtha (superworldly[]{#calibre_link-2872} or absolute)
and samvrti (worldly or conventional). These two lie sharply contrasted,
the former as the real truth, and the latter as the truth concealed by
the veil of falsehood and ignorance" (p. 46). Now while Nagao, to be
sure, is less disparaging of the conventional truth than is Murti,
noting the alternative etymologies of *"saṃvrti-satya"* and allowing
that "...the Twofold[]{#calibre_link-2873} Truth opens a channel by
which language recovers itself in spite of its falsehood and ignorance,"
he emphasizes that "the 'silence' of *paramārtha* is true 'Wisdom' " (p.
46) Hence in the end, he agrees with Murti on the critical interpretive
claim that the two truths are radically distinct from one another and
that the conventional truth is not in fact a truth in
any[]{#calibre_link-2874} straightforward sense. See also Napper
\[1993\] and Hopkins \[1983\] for a similar interpretation.

There are two things to say about this interpretation: First, as
Nāgārjuna would be quick to point out, absolutism is not the only
alternative to nihilism. Mādhyamika is an attempt to forge a middle path
between[]{#calibre_link-2875} precisely those two extremes. And second,
to say that a rejection of absolutism is a rejection of the reality of
the world tout court is to presuppose exactly the equation of existence
with inherent existence that is the target of Nāgārjuna's critique. To
the extent that "reality" is interpreted to be absolute reality,
Nā[]{#calibre_link-2876}gārjuna indeed advocates a "no-reality view."
But to the extent that we accept the Mādhyamika reinterpretation of
"reality" as conventional reality, no such consequence follows.

Streng (1973) agrees:

Because Nāgārjuna's ultimate affirmation is
*pratītyasamutpā[]{#calibre_link-2877}da,* any conventional affirmation
that might suggest an absolute, in the form of a dogma or doctrine, is
avoided. *Evenśūnya, asvabhāva*, *Tathāgata* or *pratyaya* cannot be
transformed into absolutes....

...The highest awareness, which is needed for release from *svabhāva,*
is not the result of[]{#calibre_link-2878} moving from the finite to the
infinite, but the release from ignorance about the dependent
co-origination of anything at all. *Paramārthasatya,* then, is living in
full awareness of dependent co-origination... (p. 36).

every trace of inner selfhood (p. 15).

correcting philosophers. He is no Berkeley, suggesting that his own
position is that of common sense and that only a philosopher would
reify. In fact, it is fundamental to any Buddhist outlook, and certainly
to Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2886}rjuna's view, that one of the root
delusions that afflicts all non-buddhas is the innate tendency to reify.
But that tendency is raised to high art by metaphysics. Nāgārjuna
intends his attack to strike both at the prereflective delusion and at
its more sophisticated philosophical counterpart. But in doing so, he is
not denying, and is[]{#calibre_link-2887} in fact explaining, the
nonmetaphysical part of our commonsense framework---that part that
enables us to act and to communicate and, especially for Nāgārjuna, to
practice the Buddhist path.

suspect. Whether one argues along Kantian lines,
or[]{#calibre_link-2890} from general relativity theory, space
apparently shares, from the transcendental point of view, the
impermanence of all other phenomena. But second, and for the purposes of
understanding this text, more importantly, Nāgārjuna never asserts the
permanence of space and repeatedly associates emptiness with
impermanence. I would thus argue[]{#calibre_link-2891} that other
Māhāyana literature to the contrary notwithstanding, nothing in
Nāgārjuna's presentation of Mādhyamika entails the permanence of space

critical insight par excellence which is free from all essentialist
picture-thinking" (p. 489).

[]{#calibre_link-257}[132.](#calibre_link-783){.nounder} Though it is
standard doctrine that[]{#calibre_link-2908} a buddha, in virtue of
being omniscient (setting aside the vexed and controversial question of
the nature of this omniscience---a matter of considerable debate within
Buddhist philosophy), perceives all conventional phenomena and knows all
conventional truths, as well as all ultimate truths. But a buddha does
not know conventional truths and perceive conventional phenomena in the
same way that a nonenlightened[]{#calibre_link-2909} being does. A
buddha knows them and perceives them as conventional and sees them at
the same time as empty, through an immediate knowledge of the unity of
the two truths. A non-buddha, by contrast, even if s/he knows that
conventional phenomena are empty, through studying Mādhyamika
philosophy, perceives them as inherently existent and only reasons
her/himself into[]{#calibre_link-2910} the knowledge that these
phenomena are really empty and that these truths are merely
conventional.

(1986) reads this verse differently. He translates it as follows:
"Whatever is the extremity of freedom and the extremity of the
life-process, between them not even a subtle something is evident." He
then takes the purport to be the denial of any entity such as a \"seed
of release\" mediating between the states of *saṃsara and nirvaṇa* (p.

points out (pp. 68-70) that Nāgārjuna should also be read here and in
this chapter as a whole as emphasizing that, in virtue of the emptiness
of all phenomena in *saṃsāra* and of the self that experiences them,
*nirvāṇa,* which[]{#calibre_link-2915} is defined simply as that self's
liberation from positing those phenomena, must be equally empty. For it,
too, can only be understood as a characteristic of that empty self and
of its relation to empty phenomena.

(Skt.: *saṃskāra).* This term is often translated in this text as
"disposition." It can also mean" to compound" or "compounded
phenomenon." Here it must function as a verb. Both Streng (1967) and
Inada (1970) prefer the reading" to compound" or" to construct." But
given Nāgā[]{#calibre_link-2920}rjuna's theory of action, as we have
seen, dispositions and actions are of a kind. And what generates the
karma that creates and maintains cyclic existence is action. Hence, I
read the term here as denoting action and disposition together, via its
primary meaning, "disposition." This receives further support from the
use of the nominal *"byed-po,"* which is cognate with the compound *"du
byed"* and[]{#calibre_link-2921} is most naturally translated as
"agent." It is important, however, to bear in mind that Nāgārjuna is
discussing actions and dispositions together as a unitary phenomenon and
thinking of them---as the translations of Inada and Sprung bring to the
fore---as that which constructs or creates our future existence. dGe
'dun-grub agrees with this[]{#calibre_link-2922} reading, as does Je
Tsong Khapa. I am indebted to the Ven. Sherab Gyatso for convincing me
of this.

mKhas-grub-rje (pp. 112-17), and dGe-'dun-grub (p. 237) and by most of
the Geluk-pa scholars with whom I have consulted. Whether Candrakīrti or
Āryadeva read the text this way is unclear. On the other hand, many
Nyingma scholars adopt the alternative reading I suggest here. In
conversation, H.H. the Dalai Lama[]{#calibre_link-2925} has suggested to
me that the Geluk-pa interpretation may make the most sense from the
standpoint of philosophy and for the purposes of characterizing an
inferential understanding of emptiness, but that the Nyingma
understanding may provide a better expression of the nature of the
direct understanding of emptiness and may be more useful for guiding
meditative practice. The Ven. Prof. Geshe Yeshes[]{#calibre_link-2926}
Thap-Khas, on the other hand (oral commentary), suggests that the two
interpretations are both intended---the first as the teaching regarding
the conventional truth, and appropriate for those not yet advanced in
meditative practice, and the second as a teaching regarding the nature
of the direct realization of emptiness experienced by a buddha at
enlightenment, and by advanced practitioners in
meditative[]{#calibre_link-2927} equipoise directly realizing emptiness.
Huntington (1989), pp. 119-22, presents a clear and compelling
discussion of such direct realization. He writes of the difference
between a dualistic and nondualistic awareness of the world:

The difference is one of attitude, for all else remains as it was.
Similarly, when the bodhisattva cultivates non-dualistic knowledge he
both sees and sees through[]{#calibre_link-2928} the natural
interpretations that structure his world. He sees nothing new or
different, but he knows, directly and incorrigibly, that all the
elements of experience are dependent upon one another and upon the
nature of the perceiving consciousness in a very profound and
significant way. (p. 122)

support the second reading as the primary meaning of the verse and as
the final expression of the emptiness of emptiness (personal
communication). Inada (1970) waffles. In his commentary (p. 164), he
endorses the "all views" reading. But in his translation (p. 171), he
inserts "false" parenthetically before[]{#calibre_link-2931} "views."
These are clearly not consistent moves. Ng (1993) also agrees with the
"false view" reading. See pp. 18-20.

[]{#calibre_link-266}[139.](#calibre_link-797){.nounder} The Ven. Prof.
Geshe Yeshes Thap-Khas (oral commentary) points out that emptiness as it
appears in direct realization does not appear as an entity *(ngospo).*
From the ultimate point of view there are no entities. Since a view is
always a view of an entity, in direct realization of emptiness, there is
a necessary relinquishing of all views, including all Buddhist and all
Mā[]{#calibre_link-2934}dhyamika views. But, he argues, it does not
follow that one not directly realizing emptiness can relinquish all
views or, in particular, that one should relinquish true ones. Insofar
as direct realization of emptiness is a primary goal of Buddhist
practice, he argues, and especially of the practice of Buddhist
philosophy, it is hence appropriate to read this verse in this way as
well as in the[]{#calibre_link-2935} more conventional way.

The Ven. Geshe Yeshe Topden (also in oral commentary) puts this a bit
differently: Emptiness, he argues, when it is known inferentially, is
known as a positive phenomenon and appears as an inherently existent
entity, even though the subject of such a cognition knows that it is not
so (compare a mirage that appears as water even to someone who knows
that it is merely a mirage).[]{#calibre_link-2936} And in order to
realize emptiness in this way, one must make use of the Mādhyamika view
while rejecting all false views. To one who directly apprehends
emptiness, however, he claims, emptiness, while an object of such an
awareness, is not a positive phenomenon, but a mere negation of all
positive phenomena and is not different in entity from the mind
cognizing it.[]{#calibre_link-2937} In such an awareness, he claims,
since emptiness does not appear as qualified in any way and since such
an awareness is nonconceptual, there is no view of emptiness. So, he
argues, even the Mādhyamika view is to be relinquished at the stage of
direct realization. Nonetheless, the verse indicates first, on his
reading, the necessity to relinquish all false views,
and[]{#calibre_link-2938} then, in direct realization to relinquish the
Mādhyamika view.

Mukherjee (1985) makes a similar point:

A significant point that the Mādhyamikas never fail to make out is that
reason and concepts have a place in *Vyavahāra.* It is possible to
select a pattern, hold a position without clinging to it,
i.e.,[]{#calibre_link-2939} without being dogmatic. It teaches one to
look at a view as something relative and shows that the error of
clinging is not essential to reason. ... Did not the Buddha himself use
words, concepts without clinging to them? . . .

By being free of clinging one attains a level that is transcendent to
all the views, but at the same time he remains fully cognisant of the
other levels in their minutest[]{#calibre_link-2940} details without
losing sight of the undivided reality. He sees these levels as not yet
perfect; he sees them as various stages on the way to the perfect." (pp.
221-22)

See also Kalupahana (1986), p. 80. But Kalupahana also says that these
final lines "clearly show that Nāgārjuna was aware that the Buddha did
not speak 'metaphysically'[]{#calibre_link-2941} but only 'empirically'
" (p. 391). That conclusion certainly does not follow. To refuse to give
a metaphysical theory of the nature of phenomena and to refuse to
characterize what cannot be spoken of coherently does not by itself
constitute an eschewal of metaphysics. Nor does it indicate that the
arguments offered in this text are empirical. Manifestly, a great deal
of metaphysics (albeit of a[]{#calibre_link-2942} highly critical and
negative kind) and very little empirical discussion occur in this text.

[]{#calibre_link-267}[140.](#calibre_link-799){.nounder} Wood (1994)
argues, following his nihilistic interpretation of Nāgārjuna, that here
and in *Vigrahavyāvartanī* Nāgārjuna is, in virtue of denying the
existence of even his own view, completing a nihilistic program that
denies existence of any[]{#calibre_link-2945} kind to anything. As
should be clear by now, I think that this nihilistic reading is
untenable. Nonetheless, it is surely the case that Wood is correct in
claiming that Nāgārjuna wishes to treat emptiness in exactly the way
that he treats other phenomena---as empty---and that any theory about it
that presupposes it has an essence must be[]{#calibre_link-2946} false.
I part company with Wood only when he goes on to interpret emptiness as
complete nonexistence. A careful reading of *Vigrahavyāvartanī* reveals,
as Wood notes, that Nāgārjuna denies that he has a proposition
*(pratijñā)*, but not that he utters words.
Nā[]{#calibre_link-2947}gārjuna is working to show the merely
conventional character of his utterance and that its utility does not
entail the existence of any convention-independent reality as its
semantic value. But that is a far cry from nihilism. See Garfield
(unpublished) for a more sustained discussion of emptiness and
positionlessness.

agrees. See chap. 6.
