end-a wealth of supplementary material relating to the genesis of The           The Arcades

Project. From this textual-critical apparatus, drawn on for the Translators' Notes,
we have extracted three additional sets of preliminary drafts and notations and
translated them in the Addenda; we have also reproduced the introduction by the
German editor, Rolf Tiedemann, as well as an account of Benjamin's last days
written by Lisa Fittko and printed in the original English at the end of the
German edition. Omitted from our volume are some 100 pages of excerpts from
letters to and from Benjamin, documenting the growth of the project (the major­       major-
ity of these letters appear elsewhere in English); a partial bibliography, compiled
by Tiedemann, of 850 works cited in the "Convolutes"; "Convolutes"; and, fi finally, precise
descriptions of Benjamin's manuscripts and manuscript variants (see translators'
"Convolutes ""). In an effort to respect the unique constitution of
initial note to the "Convolutes
these manuscripts, we have adopted Tiedemann's practice of using angle brack­         brack-
ets to indicate editorial insertions into the text.
A salient feature of the German edition of Benjamin's "Convolutes"
(''Aufzeichnungen und Materialien") is the use of two different typefaces: a larger
one for his reflections in German and a smaller one for his numerous citations in
French and German. According to Tiedemarm's introduction, the larger type was
used for entries containing siguifi         cant commentary by Benjamin. (In "First
siguificant
Sketches;' the two different typefaces are used to demarcate canceled passages.)
This typographic distinction, desigued no doubt for the convenience of readers,
although it is without textual basis in Benjanrin's manuscript, has been main­         main-
tained in the English translation. We have chosen, however, to use typefaces
differing in style rather than in size, so as to avoid the hierarchical implication of
the German edition (the privileging of Benjamin's refl       reflections over his citations,
and, in general, of German over French). What Benjamin seems to have con­                con-
ceived was a dialectical relation-a formal and thematic interfusion of citation
and commentary. It is an open, societary relation, as in the protocol to the
imaginary world inn      inn (itself an unacknowledged citation from Baudelaire's

As for the bilingual character of the text as a whole, tllls has been, if not
entirely eliminated in the English-language edition, then necessarily reduced to
merely the citation of the original titles of Benjanlin's sources. (Previously pub­     pub-
lished translations of these sources have been used, and duly noted, wherever
possible; where two or more published translations of a passage are available, we
have tried to choose the one best suited to Benjamin's context.)          In most cases we

Haussmann's ideal in city planning consisted of long perspectives down broad
straight thoroughfares. Such an ideal corresponds to the tendency-common in
the nineteenth century-to ennoble technological necessities through artistic
ends. "n1e institutions of the bourgeoisie's worldly and spiritual dominance were
to
to find their apotheosis within the framework of the boulevards. Before their
completion, boulevards were draped across with canvas and unveiled like monu-

The Galeries de Bois, ··which disappeared in 1828-1829 to make room for the
Galerie d'Orleans, were made up of a triple line of shops that could hardly be
called luxurious. There were two parallel lanes covered by canvas and planks,
with a few glass panes to let the daylight in. Here one walked quite simply on the
packed earth, which downpours sometimes transformed into mud. Yet people
came from all over
over to crowd into this place, which was nothing short of mag­ mag-
nifi ent, and stroll between the rows of shops that would seem like mere booths
nificent,
compared to those that have come after them. These shops were occupied chiefly
by two industries, each having its own appeal.
appeal. There were, first, a great many
milliners, who worked on large stools facing outward, without even a window to
separate them; and their spirited expressions were, for many strollers, no small

part of the place's attraction. And then the Galeries de Bois were the center of the
new book trade." Theodore Muret, L'Histoire par le theatre, vol. 2, pp. 225-226.

"Once the socialist government had become the legitimate owner     owner of all the houses

street-galleries . .... The architects accomplished the mission entrusted to them as
well as could be expected. On the second story of every house, they took all             all the
rooms that faced the street and demolished the intervening partitions; they then
opened up large bays in the dividing walls, thereby obtaining street-galleries that
had the height and width of an ordinary room and that occupied the entire length
of a block of buildings. In the newernewer quartiers, where neighboring houses have

�"In
~"In order to grasp the essence of contemporary fashion, one need not recur to
motives of an individual nature, such as ...    . . the desire for change, the sense of
beauty, the passion for dressing up, the drive to conform. Doubtless such motives
have, at various times, .... played a part .... . in the creation of clothes .... . . Never­
Never-
theless, fashion, as we understHnd it today, has no individual motives but only a
social motive, and it is an accurate perception of this social motive that determines
the full appreciation of fashion's essence. This motive is the effort to distinguish
the higher
higher classes of
of society from the lower, or or more especially from the middle
classes ....
. . Fashion is the barrier-continually raised anew hecause continually
torn down-by which the fashionable world seeks to segregate itself         itself from the
middle region ofof society; it is the mad pursuit of that class vanity through which a
single phenomenon endlessly repeats itself: the endeavor
endeavor of of one group to establish
a lead, however
however minimal, overover its pursuers, and the endeavor
endeavor of the other
other group to
make up the distance by immediately adopting the newest  newest fashions of the leaders.
The characteristic features of contemporary fashion are thus explained: above all,
its origins in the upper
upper circles and its imitation in the middle strata of society.
Fashion moves from top to bottom, not vice versa ....     . . . An attempt by the middle
classes to introduce a new fashion would .... never

Fuchs on Jhering's analysis of fashion:
fashion: "It must .... be reiterated that the concern
for segregating the classes is only one cause of the frequent variation in fashions,
and that a second cause-the private-capitalist mode of production, which in the
interests of its profit margin must continually multiply the possibilities of turn­ turn-
over-is of equal importance. This cause has escaped Jhering entirely, as has a
third:

Only someone who has grown up in the big city can appreciate its rainy weather,
which altogether slyly sets one dreaming back to early childhood. Rain makes
everything more hidden, makes days not only gray but uniform. From morning
until evening, one can do the same thing-play chess, read, engage in argu­        argu-
ment-whereas slmshine, by contrast, shades the hours and discountenances the
dreamer. The latter, therefore, must get around the days of sun with subter­    subter-
fuges-above all, must rise quite early,
early, like the great idlers, the waterfront loafers
and the vagabonds: the dreamer must be up before the sun itself.        In the "Ode to
itself. In
Blessed Morning;' which some years past he sent to Emmy Hennings, Ferdi­         Ferdi-

network of public streets. // Despite my long residence in the provinces (no less

How Baron Haussmann advanced upon the dream city that Paris still was in 1860.
From an article of 1882: "There were hills in Paris, even on the Boulevards .... . . .
We lacked water, markets, light in those remote times-scarcely thirty years ago.
Some gas jets had begun to appear-that is all. We lacked Churches, too. A num­ num-
ber of the more ancient ones, including the most beautiful, were serving as stores,
barracks, oror offices. The others were wholly concealed by a growth of tumbledown
hovels. Still, the Railroads existed; each day in Paris they discharged torrents of
travelers who could neither lodge in ourour houses nor roam through ourour tortuous
streets. / ...
. . He [Haussmann] demolished some quartier's-one might say, entire
towns. There were cries that he would hring on the plague; he tolerated such
outcries and gave us instead-through his well-considered architectural break­ break-
throughs-air, health, and life. Sometimes it was a Street that he created, some­
some-
times an Avenue or   or Boulevard; sometimes it was a Square
Square~� a Public Garden, a
Promenade. He established Hospitals, Schools, Campuses. He gave us a whole
river. He dug magnifi    ent sewers." Memoires du Baron Haussmann, vol. 2 (Paris,

On Haussmann:
Haussmann: "Paris now ceased forever to be a conglomeration of small towns,
each with its distinctive physiognomy and way of life-where one was born and
where one died, where one never dreamed of leaving home, and where nature and
history had collaborated to realize variety in unity. The centralization, the mega­
mega-
lomania, created an artifi
artificial city, in which the Parisian (and this is the crucial
point) no longer
longer feels at home; and so, as soon as he can, he leaves. And thus a new
need arises: the craving for holidays in the country. On the other hand, in the city
deserted by its inhabitants, the foreigner arrives on a specified
specified date-the
date-the start of
�the

crossroads, now seems like one deracinated." IJucien Dubech and Pierre

'�The complicated construction (out of iron and copper) of the Corn Exchange in
1811 was the work of the architect Bellange and the engineer Brunet. It is the first
time, to our knowledge, that architect and engineer are no longer united in one
person . . . . Hittorff, the builder of the Gare du Nord, got his insight into iron
construction from Bellallge.-Naturally, it is a matter more of an application of
iron than a construction in iron. Techniques of wood construction were simply
transposed to iron. " Sigfried Giedion, Bauen in Frankreich, p. 20.           [F2,6]


Apropos of Veugny's covered market built in 1824 near the Madeleine: "The slen­
derness of the delicate cast-iron columns brings to mind Pompeian wall paintings.
�The construction, in iron and cast iron, of the new market near the Madeleine is
one of the most graceful achievements in this genre. One cannot imagine anything
more elegant or in better taste . . . . ' Eck, Traite. '" Sigfried Giedion, Bauen in
Frankreich, p. 21.                                                             [F2,7]

"The most important step toward industrialization: mechanical prefabrication of
specific forms (sections) out of wrought iron or steel. The fields interpenetrate: . . .
in 1832, railroad workers began not with building components but with rails. Here
is the point of departure for sectional iron, which is the basis of iron construction.
[Note to this passage: The new methods of construction penetrate slowly into
industry. Double-T iron was used in flooring for the first time in Paris in 1845.
when the masons were out on strike and the price of wood had risen due to in­
creased construction and larger spans. r Giedion. Bauen in Frankreich, p. 26.

The first structures made of iron served transitory purposes: covered markets,
railroad stations, exhibitions. Iron is thus immediately allied with functional
moments in the life of the economy. What was once functional and transitory,
however, begins today, at an altered tempo, to seem formal and stable.           [F2,9]


" Les Hanes consist of two groups of pavilions joined to each other by covered
lanes. It is a somewhat timid iron structure that avoids the generous spans of
Horeau and Flachat and obviously keeps to the model of the greenhouse."

On the Gare du Nord: ��Here they have entirely avoided that ahundance of space

"Wherever the nineteenth century feels itself to be unobserved, it grows bold:'
Giedion, Bauen in Fran/midI, p. 33. In fact, this sentence holds good in the

magazines and children's books, for example, is proof of the point.             [F2a,3]

There is talk of renewing art by beginning with forms. But are not forms the true
mystery of nature, which reserves to itself the right to remunerate-precisely
through them-the accurate, the objective, the logical solution to a problem posed
in purely objective tenns? When the wheel was invented, enabling continuous
forward Illotion over the ground, wouldn't someone there have been able to say,
with a certain justification, "And now, into the bargain, it's round-it's in thefirm
ofa wheel?" Are not all great conquests in the field of forms ultimately a matter of
technical discoveries? Only now are we beginning to guess what forms-and
they will be detenninative for our epoch-lie hidden in machines. "To what
extent the old forms of the instruments of production influenced their new forms
from the outset is shown, . .. perhaps more strikingly than in any other way, by
the attempts, before the invention of the present locolllotive, to construct a loco�
motive that actually had two feet, which, after the fashion of a horse, it raised
alternately from the ground. It is only after considerable development of the
science of mechanics, and accunlulated practical experience, that the form of a
machine becomes settled entirely in accordance with mechanical principles, and
emancipated from the traditional form of the tool that gave rise to it:' (In this
sense, for exanlple, the supports and the load, in architecture, are also "forms.")

Through the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, architecture is linked with the plastic arts.
"That was a disaster for architecture. In the Baroque age, this unity had been
perfect and self-evident. In the course of the nineteenth century, however, it
became untenable." Sigfried Giedion, Bauen in FTankreich <Leipzig and Berlin,
1928>, p. 16. This not only provides a very inrportant perspective on the Ba­
roque; it also indicates that architecture was historically the earliest field to out­
grow the concept of art, or, better, that it tolerated least well being contemplated
as "art "-a category which the nineteenth century, to a previously uninlagined
extent but with hardly more justification at bottom, inrposed on the creations of
intellectual productivity.                                                      [F3,1]

The dusty fata morgana of the winter garden, the dreary perspective of the train
station, with the small altar of happiness at the intersection of the tracks-it all
molders under spurious constnlctions, glass before its time, prelnature iron.For
in the first third of the previous century, no one as yet understood how to build
with glass and iron. Tbat problem, however, has long since been solved by
hangars and silos.Now, it is the same with the human material on the inside of
the arcades as with the materials of their constmction. Pimps are the iron up­
rights of this street, and its glass breakables are the whores.                 [F3,2]

��The new 'architecture' <Bauen> has its origin in the moment of industry's forma­
tion, around 1830-the moment of mutation from the craftsmanly to the industrial
production process. Giedion, Bauen in Frankreich, p. 2 .

"Railroad tracks;' with the peculiar and unmistakable dream world that attaches
to them, are a very impressive example of just how great the natural symbolic
power of technological illliovation can be. In this regard, it is illuminating to learn
of the bitter polemic waged against iron rails in the 1830s. In A Treatise in
Elementary Locomotion, for exanlple, A. Gordon argued that the steam carriage (as
it was called then) should run on lanes of granite. It was deemed inlpossible to
produce enough iron for even the very small number of railway lines being
planned at that tinle.                                                             [F3,4]

It must be kept in mind that the magnificent urban views opened up by new
constmctions in iron-Giedion, in bis Bauen in Frankreich (illustrations 61-63),
gives excellent examples with the Pont Transbordeur in Marseilles-for a long
time were evident only to workers and engineers. 0 Marxism 0 For in those days
who besides the engineer and the proletarian had climbed the steps that alone
made it possible to recognize what was new and decisive about these stmctures:
the feeling of space?                                                              [F3,5]

In 1791 ? the term ingenieur began to be used in France for those officers skilled in
the arts of fortification and siege. ��At the same time? and in the same country, the
opposit.ion between 'construction' and 'architecture" began to make itself felt; and
before long it figured in personal attacks. This antithesis had been entirely un­
known in the past. . . . But in the innumerable aesthetic treatises which after the
storms of the Revolution guided French art back into regular channels, . . . the
constructeurs stood opposed to the decorateurs, and with this the further question
arose: Did not the ingenieurs, as the allies of the former� necessarily occupy with
them, socially speaking, a distinct camp?" A. G. Meyer, Eisenbauten (Esslingen,
1907), p. 3.                                                                  [F3,6]

�'The technique of stone architecture is stereotomy; that of wood is tectonics. What
does iron construction have in common with the one or the other?" Alfred Gott­
hold Meyer, Eisenbuuten (Esslingen, 1907) � p. 5. " In stone we feel the natural
spirit of the mass. Iron is, for us, only artificially compressed durability and
tena<�ity" (p. 9). "'Iron has a tensile strength forty times greater than that of stone
and ten times greater than that of wood, although its net weight is only four times
that of stone and only eight times that of wood. In comparison ·with a stone mass of
the same dimensions, therefore, an iron hody possesses, -with only four times the
weight, a load limit forty times higher" (I'. Il).                                [F3,7]

'''This material, in its first hundred years, has ah-eady undergone essential trans­
formations-cast iron, wrought iron, ingot iron-so that today the engineer has at.

Meanwhile, how it looked in the vulgar consciousness is indicated by the crass
yet typical utterance of a contemporary journalist, according to whom posterity
will one day have to confess, "In the nineteenth century, ancient Greek architec­
ture once again blossomed in its classical purity." Europa,        2 (Stuttgart and
Leipzig, 1837), p. 20Z                                                         [F3a,2]

Railroad stations as ��abodes of art." "If Wiertz had had at his disposal . . . the
public monuments of modern civilization-railway stations, legislative chambers,
university lecture halls , marketplaces, town halls- . . . who can say what bright
and dramatic new worlds he would have traced upon his canvas!" A. J . Wiertz,

The technical absolutism that is fundamental to iron construction-and funda­
mental merely on account of the material itself-becomes apparent to anyone
who recognizes the extent to which it contrasts with traditional conceptions of
the value and utility of building materials. "Iron inspired a certain distrust just
because it was not immmediately furnished by nature, but instead had to be
artificially prepared as a building material.This distrust is only a specific applica­
tion of that general sentiment of the Renaissance to which Leon Battista Alberti
(De re aedijicatoria [paris, 1512], fo!' xliv) gives expression at one point with the
words: 'Nam est quidem cujusquis corporis pars indissolubilior, quae a natura
concreta et counita est, quam quae hominum manu et arte conjuncta atque,
compacta est' <For there is, in each thing, a part that is the work and the assem­
blage of nature, and that is more indissoluble than that which is produced and
assembled by the hand of man with his art,;' A. G. Meyer, Eisenbauten (Esslin­
gen, 1907), p. 14.                                                             [F3a,4]

It is worth considering-and it appears that the answer to this question would be
in the negative-whether, at an earlier period, technical necessities in architecture
(but also in the other arts) detennined the fonns, the style, as thoroughly as they
do today, when such technological derivation seems actually to become the
signature of everything now produced. With iron as a material, tllls is already
clearly the case, and perhaps for the first time. Indeed, the "basic forms in which
iron appears as a building material are ...already themselves, as distinct synthe­
ses, partly new. And their distinctiveness, in large measure, is the product and
expression of the natural properties of the building material, since such properties
have been technically and scientifically developed and exploited precisely for
these fonns.The systematic industrial process which converts raw material into
immediately available building material begins, with iron, at a much earlier stage
than with previously existing building materials.Between matter and material, in
this case, there is a relationship quite different from that between stone and
ashlar, clay and tile, timber and beam: with iron, building material and structural
form are, as it were, more homogeneous:' A. G. Meyer, Eisenbauten (Esslingen,
1907), p. 23.                                                                 [F3a,5]

"From the fifteenth century onward, this nearly colorless glass, in the form of
window panes, rules over the house as well. 11,e whole development of interior
space obeys the command: 'More light!"-In seventeenth-century Holland, this
development leads to window openings that, even in houses of the middle class,
ordinarily take up almost half the wall. . . . / The abundance of light occasioned
by this practice must have . . . soon become disagreeable. Within the room,
curtains offered a relief that was quickly to become, through the overzealous art
of the upholsterer, a disaster. .. . / The development of space by means of glass
and iron had come to a standstill./ Suddenly, however, it gained new strength
from a perfectly inconspicuous source./ Once again, this source was a 'house;
one designed to 'shelter the needy; but it was a house neither for mortals nor for
divinities, neither for hearth fires nor for inanimate goods; it was, rather, a house
for plants. / The origin of all present-day architecture in iron and glass is the
greenllouse:' A. G. Meyer, Eisenbauten, p.55. 0 Light in the Arcades 0 Mirrors 0

On the Crystal Palace of 1851: "Of all the great things about this work, the great­
est, in every sense of the word, is the vaulted central hall . . . . Now, here too, at
first, it was not a space-articulating architect who did the talking but a-gar­
dener. . . . This is literally true: the main reason for the elevation of the central
hall was the presence, in this section of Hyde Park, of magnificent elm trees, which
neither the Londoners nor Paxton himself' wished to see felled. Incorporating them
into his giant glass house, as he had done earlier with the exotic plants at
Chatsworth, Paxton almost unconsciously-but nonetheless fundamentally-en­
hanced the architectural value of his construction." A. G. Meyer, Ei,s enbauten
(Esslingen, 1907), p. 62.                                                       [F4,2]

The following holds good for the arcades, particularly as iron stmctures: "Their
most essential component ...is the roof. Even the etymology of the word 'hall'"
points to this. It is a covered, not an enclosed space; the side walls are, so to

speak, 'concealed;" This last point pertains in a special sense to the arcades,
whose walls have only secondarily the function of partitioning the hall; primarily,
they serve as walls or fa�ades for the commercial spaces within them. The pas­
sage is from A. G. Meyer, Eisenbauten, p.69.                                     [F4,4)

The arcade as iron construction stands on the verge of horizontal extension.
That is a decisive condition for its "old-fashioned" appearance.It displays, in this
regard, a hybrid character, analogous in certain respects to that of the Baroque
church-"the vaulted 'hall' that comprehends the chapels only as an extension of
its own proper space, which is wider than ever before. Nevertheless, an attraction
'from on high' is also at work in this Baroque hall-an npward-tending ecstasy,
such as jubilates from the frescoes on the ceiling. So long as ecclesiastical spaces
ann to be more than spaces for gathering, so long as they stl�ve to safeguard the
idea of the eternal, they will be satisfied with nothing less than an overarching
nnity, in which the vertical tendency outweighs the horizontal;' A. G. Meyer,
Eisenbauten, p. 74. On the other hand, it may be said that something sacral, a
vestige of the nave, still attaches to this row of commodities that is the arcade.
From a functional point of view, the arcade already occupies the field of horizon­
tal amplitude; architecturally, however, it still stands within the conceptual field of
the old "hall;'                                                                  [F4,5)

Historical extension of the horizontal: '"From the palaces of the Italian High Ren­
aissance, the chateaux of the French kings take the 'gallery,' which-as in the case
of the 'Gallery of Apollo' at the Louvre and the 'Gallery of Mirrors' at Versailles­
becomes the emblem of majesty itself.... / Its new triumphal advance in the nine­
teenth century begins under the sign of the purely utilitarian structure, with those
halls known as warehouses and markets, workshops and factories; the problem of'
railroad stations and, above all, of exhibitions leads it back to art. And every­
where the demanu for continuous horizontal extension is so great that the stone
arch and the wooden ceiling can have only very limited applicatiolls. . . . In Gothic
structures, the walls turn into the ceiling, whereas in iron halls of the type . . .
represented by the Gallery of Machines ill Paris, the ceiling slides over the walls
without interruption." A. G. Meyer, Eisenbauten, pp. 74-75.                    [F4a,l)

Never before was the criterion of the "Ininimal" so important.And that includes

the earliest manifestation of the principle of montage. On building the Eiffel

span of spiritual energy, which channels the inorganic material energy into the
smallest, most efficient fonns and conjoins these fornls in the most effective
marmer....Each of the twelve thousand metal fittings, each of the two and a half
million rivets, is machined to the millimeter.... On this work site, one hears no

""Around 1878, it was thought that salvation lay in iron construction. Its "yearning
for verticality' (as Salomon Reinach put it), the predominance of empty spaces
over filled spaces, and the lightness of its visible frame raised hopes that a style was
emerging in which the essence of the Gothic genius would be revived Hnd rejuve­
nated by a new spirit and new materials. But when engineers erected the Galel'ie

such ideals . Daumier '8 caricatures were thus the almost involuntary consequence
of a lofty ambition that failed in its aim of attunement with the middle-class pub­

curtail . . . the boldness of the press, which had been publicly blamed for the deed.
Political caricature became impossible . . . . Hence, the drawings of lawyers done
in this period are . . . by far the most passionate and animated. The courtroom is

The Eiffel Tower: ""It is characteristic of this most famous construction of the
epoch that, for all its gigantic stature, . . . it nevertheless feels like a kniekknack,
which . . . speaks for the fact that the seeond-rate artistic sensibility of the era
could think, in general, only within the framework of genre and the technique of
filigree." Egon Friedell, Kulturgeschichte del' Neuzeit, vol. 3 (Munieh, 1931),

�'Michel Chevalier sets down his dreams of the new temple in a poem:
I would have you see my temple, the Lord God said.

The eolumns of the temple
Were strong beams;
Of hollow cast.-irOIl columns
Was the organ of this new temple.


The framework was of iron, of molded steel,
Of copper and of bronze.
The arehitect had placed it upon the columns
Like a stringed instrument upon a woodwind.


From the temple came, moreover, at each moment of the day,
The sounds of' a new harmony.
The slender spire rose up like a lightning rod;
It reached to the clouds,
La Casse-tete-omanie, ou La Fureur dujour (picture Puzzle Mania, or Theire All the Rage These
Days). See F6,2.



To seek there electrie force;
Storms have charged it with vitality and tension.


At the top of the minarets
The telegraph was waving its arms,
Bringing from all parts
Good news to the people."

TIle "Chinese puzzle;' which comes into fashion during the Empire, reveals the
century's awakening sense for construction. The problems that appear, in the
puzzles of the period, as hatched portions of a landscape, a building, or a figure
are a first presentin,ent of the cubist principle in the plastic arts.     (To verify:

"Paris it vol d'oiseau " <A Bird's-Eye View of Paris)-Noire-Dame de Paris, vol. 1,
book 3-concludes its overview of the architectural history of the city with an
ironic cl1aracterization of the present day, which culminates in a description of the
architectural insignificance of the Stock Exchange. The importance of the chap­
ter is underlined by a note added to the definitive edition of 1832, which says:
"The author ...enlarges, in one of these chapters, upon the CUlTent decadence of
architecture and the now (in his view) almost inevitable demise of this king of the
arts-a view which is, unhappily, deeply rooted iu him and deeply pondered."

Before the decision to build the Palais de I'IndustrielO was made, a plan had
existed to roof over a section of the Champs-Elysees-along with its trees-in the
manner of the Crystal Palace.                                                     [F6,4]


Victor Hugo � in Notre-Dame de Paris, on the Bourse: �'If it he the rule that the
architecture of a building should he adapted to its function, . . . we can hardly
wonder enough at a monument which might equally well be a king's palace, a house
of commons, a town hall, a college, a riding school, an academy, a warehouse, a
law court, a museum, a barracks, a sepulcher, a temple, or a theater. For the
present, it is a stock exchange . . . . It is a stock exchange in France just as it would
have been a temple in Greece . . . . We have the colonnade encircling the monu-
ment, beneath which, on days of high religious solemnity, the theory of stockbro­
kers and jobbers can be majestically expounded. These, for sure, are very stately
monuments. If we add to them many fine streets, as amusing and diverse as the
Rue de Rivoli, then I do not despair but that one day a balloon's-eye view of Paris
will offer us that wealth of lines, . . . that diversity of aspect, that somehow . . .
unexpected beauty, which characterizes a checkerhoard." Victor Hugo, Oeuvres
completes, novels, vol. 3 (Paris , 1880), pp. 206-207 (Notre-Dame de Paris). I I

Palais de l'Industrie: " One is struck by the elegance and lightness of the iron
framework; yet the engineer, . . . Monsieur Bm-rauIt, has shown more skill than
taste. As for the domed glass roof, . . . it is awkwardly placed, and the idea evoked
. . . is . . . that of a large cloche: industry in a hothouse . . . . On each side of the
entrance have been placed two superb locomotives with their tenders." This last
arrangement presumably occasioned by the distribution of prizes which closed the
exhibition on November 15, 1855. Louis Enault, " Le Palais de PIndustrie," in

From Charles-Franc;ois Viel, De l'Impuissance des mathematiques pour assurer la
solidite des bc1timents (Paris � 1805): Viel distinguishes ordonnance <planning, lay­
out> from construction and faults the younger architects above all for insufficient
knowledge of the former. Ultimately responsible is " the new direction that public
instruction in this art has taken, in the wake of our political tempests" (p. 9). "As
for the geometers who practice architecture, their buildings-as regards invention
and construction-prove the nullit.y of mathematics where ordonnance and struc­
tural stability are concerned" (p. 10). "The mathematicians . . . claim to have . . .
reconciled boldness with stability. It is only under the aegis of algebra that these
two words can meet" (p. 25; it remains to be determined whether this last sentence
is meant ironically, or whether it distinguishes between algebra and mathematics).
The author criticizes the Pont du Louvre and the Pont de la Cite (both bridges
from 1803) in accordance with the principles of Leon Battista Alberti.      [F6a,3]

According to Viel� the first bridges to be built on a constructive basis would have
been undertaken around 1730.                                                   [F7,!]

In 1855, the Hotel du Louvre was constructed at a rapid tempo, so as to be in place
for the opening of the world exhibition. " For the first time � the entrepreneurs used
electric light on the site � in order to double the day's labor; some unexpected
delays occurred; the city was just coming out of the famous carpenters' strike �
which put an end to wood-frame structures in Paris. Consequently� the Hotel du
Louvre possesses the rare distinction of having wedded, in its design, the wood
paneling of old houses to the iron flooring of modern buildings. '" Vk G. d' Avenel,

Champ de Mars, we have chosen for our theme 'Metal Structures and Railroads. '"

On the Crystal Palace: "'The architect, Paxton, and the contractors, Messrs. Fox
and Henderson, had systematically resolved not to use parts with large dimen­
sions. The heaviest were hollow cast-iron girders, eight meters long, none of which
weighed more than a ton . . . . Their chief merit was that they were economical. . . .
Moreover, the execution of the plan was remarkahly rapid, since all the parts were
of a sort that the factories could undertake to deliver quickly. " Albert de Lappar­

Lapparent divides iron structures into two classes: iron structures with stone
facings and true iron structures. He places the following example among the first
sort. ""Labrouste . . . in 1868, . . . gave to the puhlic the reading room of the
�



Bihliotheque Nationale . . . . It is difficult to imagine anything more satisfying or
more harmonious than this great chamher of 1,156 square meters, with its nine
fretted cupolas, incorporating arches of iron lattice and resting on sixteen light
cast-iron columns, twelve of which are set against the walls, while four, completely
free-standing, rise from the floor on pedestals of the same metal." Alhert de Lap­

""It was in 1783, in the construction of the Theatre Fran�ais, that iron was em­
ployed fot, the first time on a large scale, by the architect Loms. Never perhaps,
has a work so audacious been attempted. When, in 1900, the theater was rehuilt in
the aftermath of a fire, it was with a weight of iron one hundred times greater than
that which the architect Louis had used for the same trusswork. Construction in
iron has provided a succession of buildings, of' which the great reading room of the

The " triumph of exposed ironwork" in the age of the genre: " It may be . . . the . . .
enthusiasm for machine technology and the faith in the superior durability of its
materials that explains why the attribute 'iron' is used . . . whenever . . . power
and necessity are supposed to be manifest. Iron are the laws of nature, and iron is
the 'stride of the worker battalion'; the . . . union of the German empire is suppos­
edly made of iron, and so is . . . the chancellor himself." Dolf Sternherger, Pano­

The iron halcony. '''In its most rigorous form, the house has a uniform fa�ade . . . .
Articulation results only from doors and windows. In France, the window is,
without exception, even in the poorest house, a porte-jenfJtre, a 'French window'
opening to the floor. . . . This makes a railing necessary; in the poorer houses it is
a plain iron hal', hut in the wealthier houses it is of' wrought iron . . . . At a certain
stage, the railing hecomes an ornament. . . . It further contributes to the articula­
tion of the fac;ade by . . . accenting the lower line of the window. And it fulfIlls both
funetions without hreaking the plane of the fa�ade. For the great architectural
mass of the modern house, with its insistent lateral extension, this articulation
could not possihly suffice. The architeets' building-sense demanded that the ever
stronger horizontal tendency of the house . . . he given expression . . . . And they
diseovered the means for this in the traditional iron grille. Across the entire length
of the building front, on one or two stories, they set a balcony provided with an
iron grat.ing of this type, which, being black, stands out very distinctly and makes
a vigorous impression. 'J,'hese halconies, . . . up to the most recent period of build­
ing, were kept. very narrow; and if through them the severity of the surface is
overcome, what can he called the relief of the fac;ade remains nonetheless quite
nat., overcoming t.he effect of' the wall as little as does the sculpt.ed ornamentation,
likewise kept flat. In t.he case of adjoining houses ? these balcony railings fuse with
one anot.her and consolidate the impression of a walled street; and this effect is
heightened hy the fact that? wherever the upper stories are used for commercial
purposes, the proprietors put up . . . not signboards hut matched gilded letters in
roman style? which, when well spaced across the ironwork, appeal' purely deeOl'a­
tive." Fritz Stahl, P"ris (Berlin <1929» , pp. 18-19.                                (F8a]

From a European perspective, things looked this way: In all areas of production,
from the Middle Ages until the beginnin g of the nineteenth cenntry, the develop­
ment of technology proceeded at a much slower rate than the development of art.
Art could take its time in variously assimilating the technological modes of
operation. But the transformation of things that set in around 1800 dictated the
tempo to art, and the more breathtaking this tempo became, the more readily the
dominion of fashion overspread all fields.Finally, we arrive at the present state of
things: the possibility now arises that art will no longer fmd time to adapt some­
how to technological processes. Tne advertisement is the ruse by which the
dream forces itself on industry.                                                         [G 1,1]

Within the frames of the pictures that hung on dining room walls, the advent of
whiskey advertisements, of Van Houten cocoa, of Amieux canned food is her-
alded. Naturally, one can say that the bourgeois comfort of the dining room has
survived longest in small cafes and other such places; but perhaps one can also
say that the space of the cafe, within which every square meter and every hour
are paid for more punctually than in apartment houses, evolved out of the latter.
The apartment from which a cafe was made is a picture puzzle < Vexierbild> with
the caption: W here is the capital hiding?                                    [G 1 ,2]

Handbill of a Parisian textiles dealer from the 18308: ··Ladies and Gentlemen: I I
ask you to cast an indulgent eye on the following observations; my desire to con­
trihute to your eternal salvation impels me to address you. Allow me to direct your
attention to the study of the Holy Scriptures, as well as to the extremely moderate
prices which I have been the first to introduce into the field of hosiery, cotton
goods, and related products. No. 13, Rue Pave-Saint-Sauveur." Eduard Kroloff,

Superposition and advertising: ""In the Palais-Royal, not long ago, between the
columns on the upper story, I happened to see a life-sized oil painting repre­
senting, in very lively colors, a French generalin full-dress uniform. I take out my
spectacles to examine more closely the historical subject of the picture, and my
general is sitting in an armchair holding out a bare foot: the podiatrist, kneeling
before him, excises the corns." J . F. Reichardt, Vertraute Briefe aus Paris (Ham­
burg, 1805), vol. 1, p. 178.                                                   [Gl,5]

In 1861, the first lithographic poster suddenly appeared on walls here and there
around London. It showed the back of a woman in white who was thickly
wrapped in a shawl and who, in all haste, had just reached the top of a flight of
stairs, where, her head half turned ,md a finger upon her lips, she is ever so
slightly opening a heavy door, through which one glimpses the starry sky. In this
way Wilkie Collins advertised his latest book, one of the greatest detective novels
ever written: The Woman in White. See Tahneyr, La Cilif du sang (Paris, 1901),
pp. 263-264.                                                                  [Gl,6]

It is significant that Jugendstil failed in interior design, and soon afterward in
architecture too, whereas in the street, with the poster, it often found very suc­
cessful solutions. This is fully confirmed in Behne's discerning critique: "By no
means was Jugendstil ridiculous in its original intentions. It was looking for
renewal because it clearly recognized the peculiar contradictions arising between
imitation Renaissance art and new methods of production deternlined by the
machine. But it gradually became ridiculous because it believed that it could
resolve the enormous objective tensions fonnally, on paper, in the studio." 0 In­
terior 0 Adolf Behne, Neues    Wahnen-Neues Bauen (Leipzig, 1927), p. 15. Of
course, in the end, the law according to which an action brings about an opposite
reaction holds true for Jugendstil. The genuine liberation from an epoch, that is,
has the structure of awakening in this respect as well: it is entirely mled by
cunning.Only with cunning, not without it, can we work free of the realm of
dream. But there is also a false liberation; its sign is violence.From the beginning,
it condemnedJugendstil to failure.0 Dream Structure 0                          [G 1,7]

Illllermost, decisive significance of the advertisement: "Good posters exist . ..
only in the domain of trifles, of industry, or of revolution;' Maurice Talmeyr, La
GiN du sang (paris, 1901), p. 277. The same thought with which the bourgeois
here detects the tendency of advertising in its early period: "In short, the moral of
the poster has nothing to do with its art, and its art nothing to do with the moral,
and this defines the character of the poster" (ibid., p. 275).                 [G1,8]

Just as certain modes of presentation-genre scenes and the like-begin, in the
course of the nineteenth century, to "cross over)) into advertising, so also into the
realm of the obscene.The Nazarene style and the Makart style have their black
and their colored lithographic cousins in the field of obscene graphics. I saw a
plate that, at first glance, could have passed as something like Siegfried's bath in
dragon blood: green sylvan solitude, crimson mantle of the hero, naked flesh, a
sheet of water-it was the most complicated embrace of tllTee human bodies, and
it looked like the frontispiece of an inexpensive book for young people. Ths is
the language of color characteristic of the posters that flourished in the arcades.
When we hear that portraits of famous cancan dancers like Rigolette and
Frichette would have hung there, we have to imagine them colored like this.
Falser colors are possible in the arcades; that combs are red and green surprises
no one. Snow White's stepmother had such things, and when the comb did not
do its work, the beantiful apple was there to help out-half red, half poison­
green, like cheap combs. Everywhere gloves play a starring role, colored ones,
but above all the long black variety on which so many, following YVette Guilbert,
have placed their hopes for happiness, and which will bring some, let us hope, to
Margo Lion. And laid out on a side table in a tavern, stockings make for an
ethereal meat counter.                                                        [G 1 a, 1]

The writings of the Surrealists treat words like trade names, and their texts are, at
bottom, a form of prospectus for enterprises not yet off the ground. Nesting
today in trade names are figments such as those earlier thought to be hidden in

Many years ago, on the streetcar, I saw a poster that, if things had their due in this
world, would have found its admirers, historians, exegetes, and copyists just as
surely as any great poem or painting. And, in fact, it was botl1 at the same time.
As is sonletimes the case with very deep, unexpected impressions, however, the
shock was too violent: the impression, if! may say so, struck with such force that
it broke through the bottom of my consciousness and for y ears lay irrecoverable
somewhere in the darkness. I knew only that it had to do with "Bullrich Salt" and
that the original warehouse for this seasoning was a small cellar on Flottwell
Street, where for years I had circumvented the temptation to get out at this point
and inquire about the poster. There I traveled on a colorless Sunday afternoon in
that northern Moabit, a part of town that had already once appeared to me as
though built by ghostly hands for just this time of day. That was when, four years
ago, I had come to Liitzow Street to pay customs duty, according to the weight of
its enameled blocks of houses, on a china porcelain city which I had had sent
from Rome. There were omens then along the way to sigoal the approach of a
momentous afternoon. And, in fact, it ended with the story of the discovery of an
arcade, a story that is too berlinisch to be told just now in this Parisian space of
remembrance. Prior to this incident, however, I stood with my two beautiful
companions in front of a miserable cafe, whose window display was enlivened by
an arrangement of sigoboards. On one of these was the legend "Bullrich Salt." It
contained nothing else besides the words; but around these written characters
there was suddenly and effortlessly configured that desert landscape of the
poster. I had it once more. Here is what it looked like. In the foreground, a
horse-drawn wagon was advancing across tl,e desert. It was loaded with sacks
bearing the words "Bullrich Salt." One of these sacks had a hole, from which salt
had already trickled a good distance on the ground. In the background of the
desert landscape, two posts held a large sigo with the words "Is the Best." But
what about the trace of salt down the desert trail? It formed letters, and these
letters formed a word, the word "Bullrich Salt:' Was not the preestablished
harmony of a Leibniz mere child's play compared to this tightly orchestrated
predestination in the desert? And didn't that poster furnish an image for things
that no one in this mortal life has yet experienced? An image of the everyday in
Utopia?                                                                         [Gla,4]



"The store known as La Chaussee d'Antin had recently announced its new
inventory of y ard goods. Over two million meters of barege, over five million of
grenadine and poplin, and over tlnee million of other fabrics-altogether about
eleven million meters of textiles. Le Tintamarre now remarked, after recommend­
ing La Chaussee d'Antin to its female readers as the 'foremost house of fashion in
the world; and also the 'most dependable': 'The entire French railway sy stem
comprises barely ten tllOusand kilometers of tracks-that is, only ten million
meters. This one store, therefore, with its stock of textiles, could virtually stretch a
tent over all the railroad tracks of France, " which, especially in the heat of
summer, would be very pleasant.'" Three or four other establishments of tlns
kind publish sinrilar figures, so that, with all tl,ese materials combined, one could
place not only Paris . . . but the whole departement of the Seine under a massive
canopy, 'which likewise would be welcome in rainy weather: But we camlOt help
asking: How are stores supposed to find room to stock tlns gigantic quantity of
goods? The answer is very simple and, what is more, very logical: each firm is
always larger than the others,

de France, the largest store in the Empire; 'La Chaussee d'Antin, the largest store
in Europe; 'Le Coin de Rue, the largest store in the world;-'In the world': that
is to say, on the entire earth there is none larger; you'd think that would he the
limit But no: Les Magasins du Louvre have not heen named, and they bear the
title 'The largest stores in the universe; The universe! Including Sirius appar­

Between the February Revolution and the June Insurrection: ��All the walls were
covered with revolutionary posters which, some years later, Alfred Delvau re­
printed in two thick volumes under the title Les Mu.railles rlJvolutionnaires, so
that today we can still get some idea of this remarkable poster literature. There
was scarcely a palace or a church on which these notices could not be seen. Never
before was such a multitude of placards on view in any city. Even the government
made use of this medium to publish its decrees and proclamations, while thou­
sands of other people resorted to affiches in order to air their views publicly on all
possihle questions. As the time for the opening of the National Assembly drew
near, the language of the posters grew wilder and more passionate . . . . The num­

who had nothing else to do, became news vendors." Sigmund Englander,

"Essence d'Amazilly, fragrance and antiseptic; hygienic toiletries from Duprat

is only to indicate that the vegetal ingredients to which this distillation owes its
surprising effectiveness come from the same torrid climate as she does. The term
'antiseptic' belongs to the lexicon of science, and we use it only to point out that,
apart from the incomparable benefits our product offers to ladies, it possesses
hygienic virtues calculated to win the confidence of all those willing to be convinced
of its salutary action. For if our lotion, unlike the waters of the Fountain of Youth ,
has no power to wash away the accumulated years, at least it does have, in addi­
tion to other merits, the inestimable advantage (we believe) of restoring to the full
extent of its former radiance the lost majesty of that consummate entity, that
masterpiece of Creation which, with the elegance, purity, and grace of its forms,
makes up the lovelier half of humanity. Without the providential supervention of
our discovery, this most brilliant and delicate ornament-resembling, in the ten­
der charms of its mysterious structure, a fragile blossom that wilts at the first hard
rain-would enjoy, at best, but a fugitive splendor, after the fading of which it
must needs languish under the ruinous cloud of illness, the fatiguing demands of
nursing, or the no less injurious emhrace of the pitiless corset. Developed, above
all, in the interests of ladies, our Essence d'Amazilly answers to the most exacting
and most intimate requirements of their toilette. It unites, thanks to a happy
infusion, all that is necessary to revive, foster, and enhance nHtural attractions,
without the slightest detriment." < Cited in> Charles Simond, Paris de 1800 (( 1900

" The first exhibition dates back to 1798; set up on the Champ de Mars, it was . . ,
an exhihition of the products of French industry and was coneeived by Fram;ois de
Neufchateau. There were three national exhibitions under the Empire (in 1801,
1802, and 1806), the first two in the courtyard of t.he Louvre, the third at the
Invalides. There were three during the Restoration (in 1819, 1823, and 1827), all
at the Louvre; three during the July Monarchy (in 1834" 1839, and 1844), on the
Place de Ia Concorde and the Champs-Elysees; and one undel' the Second Repuh­
lic, in 1849. Then, following the example of England, which had organized an
internat.ional exhibition in 1851, Imperial Franee held world exhihitions on the
Champ de Mars in 1855 and 1867. The first saw the birth of" the Palais de l'Indus­
trie, demolished during the Republic; the second was a delirious festival marking
the high point of the Second Empire. In 1878, a new exhihit.ion was organized to
attest to rehirth after defeat.; it was held on the Champ de Mars in a temporary
palace erected by Formige. It is characteristic of these enormous fairs to be
ephemeral, yet each of them has left its trace in Paris. The exhibition of 1878 was
responsible for the Trocadero, that eccentric palace clapped down on the top of
Chaillot by Davioud and Botu'dais, and also for the footbridge at Passy, built to
replace the Pont (Plena, which was no longer usable. The exhibition of 1889 left

"In 1798, a universal exposition of industry was announced; it was to take place
. . . on the Champ de Mars. The Directory had charged the minister of the interior,
Fran�ois de Neufchateau, with organizing a national festival to commemorate the
founding of the Republic. The minister had conferred with several people, who
proposed holding contests and games, like greasy-pole climbing. One person sug­
gested that a great market be set up after the fashion of country fairs, but on a
larger scale. Finally, it was proposed that an exhibition of paintings be included.
These last two suggestions gave Fran�ois de Neufchateau the idea of presenting an
exhibition of industry in celebration of the national festival. Thus, the first indus­
trial exposition is born from the wish to amuse the working classes , and it becomes
for them a festival of emancipation. . . . The increasingly popular character of
industry starts to become evident. . . . Silk fabrics are replaced by woolens, and
satin and lace by materials more in keeping with the domestic requirements of the
Third Estate: woolen bonnets and corduroys . . . . Chaptal, the spokesman for this
exhibition, calls the industrial state by its name for the first time." Sigmund

"In celebrating the centenary of the great Revolution, the French bourgeoisie has,
as it were, intentionally set out to demonstrate to the proletariat ad oculos the
economic possibility and necessity of a social uprising. The world exhibition has
given the proletariat an excellent idea of the unprecedented level of development
which the means of production have reached in all civilized lands-a development
far exc.eeding the boldest utopian fantasies of the century preceding this one . . . .
The exhibition has further demonstrated that modern development of the forces of
production must of necessity lead to industrial crises that, given the anarchy cur­
rently reigning in production, will only grow more acute with the passage of time,
and hence more destructive to the course of the world economy." G. Plekhanov,

""Despite all the posturing with which Teutonic arrogance tries to represent the

remain incomparably more powerful levers of human culture than the countless
barracks and churches with which Berlin has been inundated at such great cost.

all, on the lack of energy . . . afflicting the bourgeoisie, and, second, on the poorly

" With price tag affixed, the commodity comes on the market. Its material quality
and individuality are merely an incentive for buying and selling; for the socia]
measure of its value, such quality is of no importance whatsoever. The commodity
has become an abstraction. Once escaped from the hand of the producer and
divested of its real particularity, it ceases to be a product and to he ruled over by
human beings. It has acquired a 'ghostly ohjectivity' and leads a life ofits own. 'A
eommodity appears, at first sight, to be a trivial and easily understood thing. Our
analysis shows that, in reality, it is a vexed and complicated thing, abounding in
metaphysical suhtleties and theological niceties. ' Cut off from the will of man, it
aligns itself in a mysterious hierarchy, develops or declines exchangeability, and,
in aceordance with its own peculiar laws, performs as an actor on a phantom stage.
In the language of the commodities exchange, cotton "soars,' copper 'slumps,'
COrn 'is active; coal 'is sluggish,' wheat 'is on the road to recovery,' and petro­
leum "displays a healthy trend. ' Things have gained autonomy, and they take on
human features . . . . The commodity has heen transformed into an idol that, al­
though the product of human hands, disposes over the human. Marx speaks of the

ties . . . . It is only the particular social relation between people that here assumes,
in the eyes of these people, the phantasmagorical form of a relation between
things."'6 OUo Riihle, Karl Marx (Hellerau <1928» , pp. 384-385.                   [GS,!]


'�According to official estimates, a total of about 750 workers, chosen by their
comrades or else named by the entrepreneurs themselves, visited London's world
exhibition in 1862 . . . . The official character of this delegation, and the manner in
which it was constituted, naturally inspired little confidence in the revolutionary
and republican emigres from France. This circumstance perhaps explains why the
idea of an organized reception for this deputation originated with the editors of an
organ dedicated to the cooperative movement . . . . At the urging of the editorial
staff of The Working Man, a committee was formed to prepare a welcome for the
French workers . . . . Those named to participate included . . . J. Morton Peto, . . .
and Joseph Paxton. . . . The interests of industry were put foremost, . . . and the
need for an agreement between workers and entrepreneurs, as the sole means of
bettering the difficult condition of the workers, was strongly underlined . . . . We
cannot . . . regard this gathering as the birthplace . . . of the International Work­
ingmen's Association. That is a legend . . . . The truth is simply that this visit
acquired, through its indirect consequences, momentous importance as a key step
on the way to an understanding between English and French workers."

"Already, for the first world exhibition in 1851, some of' the workers proposed by
the entrepreneurs were sent to London at the state's expense. There was also,
however, an independent delegation dispatched to London on the initiative of
Blanqui (the economist) and Emile de Girardin . . . . This delegation submitted a
general report in which, to be sure, we find no trace of the attempt to establish a
permanent liaison with English workers, but in which the need for peaceful rela­
tions between England and France is stressed . . . . In 1855, the second world
exhibition took place, this time in Paris. Delegations of workers from the capital,
as well as from the provinces, were now totally barred. It was feared that they
would give workers an opportunity for organizing." D. Rjazanov, "Zur Geschichte

Connection of the first world exhibition in London in 1851 with the idea of free
trade.                                                                  [GSa,4]

��The world exhibitions have lost much of' their original character. The ent.husiasm
that, in 1851, was felt in the most disparate circles has subsided, and in its place
has come a kind of cool calculation. In 1851, we were living in the era of free
trade . . . . For some decades now, we have witnessed the spread of protection-
ism . . . . Participation in the exhibition becomes . . . a sort of representation . . . ;
and whereas in 1850 the ruling tenet was that the government need not concern
itself in this affair, the situation today is so far advanced that the government of
each country can be considered a veritable entrepreneur." Julius Lessing, Das
halbe Jahrhundert der Weltausstellungen (Berlin, 1900), pp. 29-30.               [GSa,S]

In London, in 1851, " appeared . . . the first cast-steel cannon by Krupp. Soon
thereafter, the Prussian minister of war placed an order for more than 200 exem­
plars of this model." Julius Lessing, Das halbe lahrhundert der Weltausstellun­
gen (Berlin, 1900), p. 1 1 .                                              [GSa,6]

"From the same sphere of thought that engendered the great idea of free trade
arose . . . the notion that no one would come away empty-handed-rather, the
contrary-from an exhibition at which he had staked his best so as to be able to
take home the best that other people had to offer. . . . This bold conception, in
which the idea for the exhibition originated, was put into action. Within eight
months, everything was finished. 'An absolute wonder that has become a part of
history. ' At the foundation of the entire undertaking, remarkably enough, rests
the principle that such a work must be backed not by the state but by the free
activity of its citizens . . . . Originally, two private contractors, the Munday broth­
ers, offered to build, at their own risk, a palace costing a million marks. But
grander proportions were resolved on, and the necessary funds for guaranteeing
the enterprise, totaling many millions, were subscribed in short order. The great
new thought found a great new form. The engineer Paxton built the Crystal Pal­
ace. In every land rang out the news of something fabulous and unprecedented: a
palace of glass and iron was going to be built, one that would cover eighteen acres.
Not long before this, Paxton had constructed a vaulted roof of glass and iron for
one of the greenhouses at Kew, in which luxuriant palms were growing, and this
achievement gave him the courage to take on the new task. Chosen as a site for the
exhibition was the finest park in London, Hyde Park, which offered in the middle
a wide open meadow, traversed along its shorter axis by an avenue of splendid
elms. But anxious onlookers soon raised a cry of alarm lest these trees be sacrificed
for the sake of a whim. 'Then I shall roof over the trees,' was Paxton's answer, and
he proceeded to design the transept, which, with its semicylindrical vault elevated
112 feet above the ground, . . . accommodated the whole row of elms. It is in the
highest degree remarkable and signific ant that this Great Exhibition of London­
born of modern conceptions of steam power, electricity, and photography, and
modern conceptions of free trade-should at the same time have afforded the
decisive impetus, within this period as a whole, for the revolution in artistic forms.
To build a palace out of glass and iron seemed to the world, in those days, a
fantastic inspiration for a temporary piece of architecture. We see now that it was
the first great advance on the road to a wholly new world of forms . . . . The con­
structive style, as opposed to the historical style, has become the watchword of the
modern movement. When did this idea make its triumphal entry into the world? In
the year 1851, with the Crystal Palace in London. At first, people thought it impos­
sible that a palace of colossal proportions could be built from glass and iron. In the
publications of the day, we find the idea of assembling iron components, so famil­
iar to us now, represented as something extraordinary. England can boast of hav­
ing accomplished this quite novel task in the space of eight months, using its
existing factories, without any additional capacity. One points out triumphantly
that . . . in the sixteenth century a small glazed window was still a luxury item,
whereas today a building covering eighteen acres can be constructed entirely out
of glass. To a manlike Lothar Bucher, the meaning of this new structure was clear:
it was the undisguised architectural expression of the transverse strength of slen­
der iron components. But the fantastic charm which the edifice exerted on all souls
went well beyond such a characterization, however crucial for the program of the
futul'e; and in this regard, the preservation of the magnificent row of trees for the
central transept was of capital importance. Into this space were transported all the
horticultural glories which the rich conservatol'ies of England had been able to
cultivate. Lightly plumed palms from the tropics mingled with the leafy crowns of
the five-hundred-year-old elms; and within this enchanted forest the decorators
arranged masterpieces of plastic art, statuary, large bronzes, and specimens of
other artworks. At the center stood an imposing crystal fountain. To the right and
to the left ran galleries in which visitors passed from one national exhibit to the
other. Overall, it seemed a wonderland, appealing more to the imagination than to
the intellect. 'It is with sober economy of phrase that I term the prospect incompa­
rably fairy-like. This space is a summer night's dream in the midnight sun'
(Lothar Bncher). Such sentiments were registered throughout the world. I myself
recall, from my childhood, how the news of the Crystal Palace reached us in
Germany, and how pictures of it were hung in the middle-class parlors of distant
provincial towns. It seemed then that the world we knew from old fairy tales-of
the princess in the glass coffin, of queens and elves dwelling in crystal houses-had
come to life . . . , and these impressions have persisted through the decades. The
great transept of the palace and part of the pavilions were transferred to Syden­
ham, where the building stands today;!! there I saw it in 1862, with feelings of awe
and the sheerest delight. It has taken four decades, numerous fires, and many
depredations to ruin this magic, although even today it is still not completely
vanished." Julius Lessing, Das halbe ]ahrhundert der 'Weltausstellungen (Berlin,
1900), pp. 6-10.                                                           [G6; G6a,1]

demand for the abrogation of Article 1781 of the Civil Code, which reads: " The
employer's word shall be taken as true in his statement of wages apportioned, of
salary paid for the year ended, and of accounts given for the current year"
(p. 140).-" The delegations of workers at the exhibitions of London and Paris in
1862 and in 1867 gave a direction to the social movement of the Second Empire,
and even, we may say, to that of the second half of the nineteenth century. . . .
Their reports were compared to the records of the Estates General; the former
were the signal for a social evolution, just as the latter, in 1789, had been the cause
of a political and econOinic revolution" (p. 207).-[This comparison comes from
Michel Chevalier.] Demand for a ten-hour workday (p. 121).-"Four hundred

Palace had been burned to the ground, supposedly as punishment." In truth,
however, the English had succeeded even more than their allies, the French, in
carrying away a large portion of the treasures amassed in that. palace, and these
treasures were subsequently put on exhibit in London in 1862. For the sake of
discretion, it was women rather than men . . . who acted as exhibitors." Julius

Tlrree different delegations of workers were sent to London in 1851; none of
them accomplished anything significant. Two were official: one represented the

understanding, members of the Commission took their appeal directly to His
Majesty. . . . The emperor . . . was, in fact, willing to authorize the Commisssion to
pursue its task. The elections . . . resulted in the selection of two hundred dele­
gates . . . . A period of ten days had been granted to each group to accomplish its
mission. Each delegate received, on his departure, the sum of 115 francs, a sec­

temples. This hall was a land of iron and fire and water; t.he ears were deafened,

The exhibition palace of 1867 on the Champ de Mars-compared by some to
Rome's Colosseum: " The arrangement conceived by Le Play, the head of the exhi­
bition committee, was a most felicitous one. The objects on exhibit were distrib­
uted, according to their materials, in eight concentric galleries; twelve avenues . . .
branched out from the center, and the principal nations occupied the sectors cut
by those radii. In this way, . . . by strolling around the galleries, one could . . .
survey the state of one particular industry in all the different countries, whereas,
by strolling up the avenues that crossed them, one could survey the state of the
different branches of industry in each particular country." Adolphe Demy, Essai
historique sur les expositions universelles de Paris (Paris, 1907), p. 129.-Cited
here is Theophile Gautier's article about the palace in Le Moniteur of September
17, 1867: " We have before us, it seems, a monument created on another planet, on
Jupiter or Saturn, according to a taste we do not recognize and with a coloration to
which our eyes are not accustomed." Just before this: "The great azure gulf, with
its blood-colored rim, produces a vertiginous effect and unsettles our ideas of
architecture. '"                                                               [G9,2]

Exhibition are hard at work . . . . The foreigners, they cry, will start a radical
revolution here; they will kill Victoria and myself and proclaim a red republic.

In his novel The Fortress, Walpole descril)es the precautions that were taken in a
lodging-house specially designed to welcome visitors to the world exhibition of
1851. These precautions included continuous police surveillance of the dormito­

Walpole describes the Crystal Palace, with the glass fountain at its center and the
old elms-the latter '�looking almost like the lions of the forest caught in a net of
glass" (p. 307). FIe describes the booths decorated with expensive carpets, and
ahove all the machines. "There were in the machine-room the 'self-acting mules,'
the Jacquard lace machines, the envelope machines, the power looms, the model
locomotives, centrifugal pumps, the vertical steam-engines, all of these working
like mad, while the thousands nearby, in their high hats and bonnets, sat patiently
waiting, passive, unwitting that the Age of Man on this Planet was doomed." FIugh

In a speech to the Senate, on January 31, 1868, Michel Chevalier makes an effort
to save the previous year's Palace of Industry from destruction. Of the various
possibilities he lays out for salvaging the huilding, the most noteworthy is that of
using the interior-which, with its circular form, is ideally suited to such a pur­
pose-for practicing troop maneuvers. FIe also proposes developing the structure
into a permanent merchandise mart for imports. The intention of the opposing
party seems to have been to keep the Champ de Mars free of all construction-this
for military reasons. See Michel Chevalier, Discours sur une petition reclamant
contre Ia destruction du palais de l'Exposition universelle de 1867 (Paris, 1868).

" The world exhibitions . . . cannot fail to provoke the most exact comparisons

Every industry, in exhibiting its trophies
In this hazaar of universal progress,
Seems to have borrowed a fairy's magie wand
To bless the Crystal Palace.

And, joining together like noble brothers,
All have at heart the happiness of each.

Palace of Industry, 1855: "Six pavilions border the building on four sides, and 306
arcades run through the lower story. An enormous glass roof provides light to the
interior. As materials, only stone, iron, and zinc have been used; building costs
amounted to 11 million francs . . . . Of particular interest are two large paintings
on glass at the eastern and western ends of the main gallery. . . . The figures repre­
sented on these appear to be life-size, yet are no less than six meters high." Acht
Tage in Paris (Paris, July 1855), pp. 9-10. The paintings on glass show figures
representing industrial France and Justice.                                    [G 1 1 )1]

" I have . . . written, together with my collaborators on L 'Atelier, that t.he moment
for economic revolution has come . . . , although we had all agreed some time
previously that the workers of Europe had achieved solidarity and that it was
necessary now to move on, before anything else, to the idea of a political federation
of peoples." A. Corbon, Le Secret du peuple de Paris (Paris, 1863), p. 196. Also
p. 242: "In sum, the political attitude of the working class of Paris consists almost
entirely in the passionate desire to serve the movement of federation of nationali­
ties."                                                                           [Gll,2]

Animal symbolism in Toussenel: the mole. ��The mole is . . . not the emhlem of a
single character. It is the emblem of a whole social period: the period of industry ?s
infancy, the Cyclopean period . . . . It is the . . . allegorical expression of the abso­
lute predominance of brute force over intellectual force. . . . Many estimable
analogists find a marked resemblance between moles, which upturn the soil and
pierce passages of subterranean communication, . . . and the monopolizers of rail­
roads and stage routes . . . . The extreme nervous sensibility of the mole, which
fears the light . . . , admirably characterizes the obstinate obscurantism of those
monopolizers of banking and of transportation, who also fear the light."

(Paris, 1884), pp. 469, 473-474.1•1                                               [Gll,4]


Animal symbolism in Toussenel: the marmot. '(,The marmot . . . loses its hail' at its
work-in allusion to the painful labor of the chimney sweep, who rubs and spoils
his clothes in his occupation." A. Toussenel, L 'Esprit des hetes (Paris, 1884),
p . 334Y                                                                   [Gll ,5]


Plant symbolism in Toussenel: the vine. "The vine loves to gossip . . . ; it mounts
familiarly to the shoulder of plum tree, olive, or elm, and is intimate with all the
trees." A. Toussenel, L'Esprit des hetes (Paris, 1884), p. 107.              [GU,6)

Toussenel expounds the theory of the circle and of the parabola with reference
to the different childhood games of the two sexes. 'Ibis recalls the anthropo­
morphisms of Grandville. "The figures preferred by childhood are invariably
round-the ball, the hoop, the marble; also the fruits which it prefers: the cherry,
the gooseberry, the apple, the jam tart. . . . The analogist, who has observed these
games with continued attention, has not failed to remark a characteristic differ­
ence in the choice of amusements, and the favorite exercises, of the children of
the two sexes . . . . What then has our observer remarked in the character of the
games of feminine infancy? He has remarked in the character of these games a
decided proclivity toward the ellipse. / I observe among the favorite games of
feminine infancy the shuttlecock and the jump rope . . . . Both the rope and the
cord describe parabolic or elliptical curves. Why so? Why, at such an early age,
tlus preference of the minor sex for the elliptical curve, this manifest contempt for
marbles, ball, and top? Because the ellipse is the curve of love, as the circle is that
of friendship. The ellipse is the figure in which God . . . has profiled the form of
His favorite creatures-woman, swan, Arabian horse, dove; the ellipse is the
essentially attractive form. . . . Astronomers were generally iguorant as to why
the planets describe ellipses and not circumferences around their pivot of attrac­
tion; they now know as much about this mystery as I do;' A. Toussenel, L'Esprit
des betes, pp. 89-91. 16                                                        [Glla,!]

'Joussenel posits a symbolism of curves, according to which the circle represents
friendship; the ellipse, love; the parabola, the sense of family; the hyperbola,
ambition. In the paragraph concerrring the hyperbola, there is a passage closely
related to Grandville: "The hyperbola is the curve of ambition. . . . Admire tl,e
determined persistence of the ardent asymptote pursuing the hyperbola in head-
long eagerness: it approaches, always approaches, its goal . . . but never attains
it:' A. Toussenel, L'Esprit des betes (Paris, 1884), p. 92 ,"            [Glla,2]

Animal symbolism in Toussenel: the hedgehog. " Gluttonous and repulsive, it is
also the portrait of the scurvy slave of the pen, trafficking with all subjects, selling
postmaster's appointments and theater passes, . . . and drawing . . . from his
sorry Christian conscience pledges and apologies at fixed prices . . . . It is said that
the hedgehog is the only quadruped of France on which the venom of the viper has
no effect. I should have guessed this exception merely from analogy. . . . For
explain . . . how calumny (the viper) can sting the literary blackguard."

" Lightning is the kiss of' clouds, stormy but faithful. Two lovel's who adore each
other, and who will tell it in spite of all ohstacles, are two clouds animated with
opposite electricities, and swelled with tragedy." A. Toussenel, L'Esprit des bfhes:
Zoologie passionnelle-Mmnmiferes de France, 4th ed. (Paris, 1884), pp. 100-
101 . "                                                                     [G12,l]

The first edition of Toussenel 's L 'Esprit des betes appeared in 1847.         [G12,2]

" J have vainly questioned the archives of antiquity to find traces of the setter dog.
I have appealed to the memory of the most lucid somnamhulists to ascertain the
epoch when this race appeared. All the information I could procure . . . leads to
this conclusion: the setter dog is a creation of modern times." A. Toussenel, L 'Es­
prit des betes (Paris, 1884), p. 159. 20                                    [G12,3]

"'A heautiful young woman is a true voltaic cell, . . in which the captive fluid is
retained by the form of surfaces and the isolating virtue of the hair; so that when
this fluid would escape from its sweet prison, it must make incredihle efforts,
which IH"oduce in turn, by influence on bodies differently animated, fearful rav­
ages of attraction. . . . The history of the human raee swarms with examples of
intelligent and learned men, intrepid heroes, . . . transfixed merely hy a woman's
eye . . . . The holy King David proved that he perfectly understood the condensing
properties of polished elliptical surfaces when he took unto himself the young
Abigail." A. Toussenel, L 'Esprit des betes (Paris , 1884), pp. 101_103 .21  [G12,4]

Toussenel explains the rotation of the earth as the resultant of a centrifugal force
and a force of attraction. Further on: "The star . . . begins to waltz its frenetic
waltz . . . . Everything rustles, stirs, warms up, shines on the surface of the globe,
which only the evening before was entomhed in the frigid silence of night. Marvel­
ous spectacle for the well-placed observer-change of scene wonderful to behold.
For the revolution took place between two suns and, that very evening, an ame­
thyst star made its first appearance in our skies" (p. 45). And, alluding to the
volcanism of earlier epochs of the earth: �'We know the effects which the first waltz
usually has on delicate eonstitutions . . . . The Earth, too, was rudely awakened by
its first ordeal." A. Toussenel, L 'Esprit des betes: Zoologie passionnelle (Paris,
1884), pp. 44-45.                                                           [GI2,5]

We can speak of a fetishistic autonomy not only with regard to the commodity
but also-as the following passage from Marx indicates-with regard to the
means of production: "If we consider the process of production from the point of
view of the simple labor process, the laborer stands, in relation to the means of
production, . . . as the mere means . . . of his own intelligent productive activ­
ity. . . . But it is different as SOon as we deal with the process of production from
the point of view of the process of surplus-value creation. The means of produc­
tion are at once changed into means for the absorption of the labor of others. It is
now no longer the laborer that employs the means of production, but the means
of production that employ the lab ore': Instead of being consumed by him as
material elements of his productive activity, they consume him as the ferment
necessary to their own life process. . . . Furnaces and workshops that stand idle
by night, and absorb no living labor, are a 'mere loss' to the capitalist. Hence,
furnaces and workshops constitute lawful claims upon the night labor of the
workpeople:' 22 'Ibis observation can be applied to the analysis of Grandville. To
what extent is the hired laborer the "soul" of Grandville's fetishistically animated
objects?                                                                      [GI2a,3]

Technique of exhibition: "A fundamental rule, quickly learned through observa­
tion, is that no object should be placed directly on the floor, on a level with the
walkways. Pianos, furniture, physical apparatus, and machines are better dis­
played on a pedestal or raised platform. The best exhibits make use of two quite
distinct systems: displays under glass and open displays. To be sure, some prod­
nets, by their very nature or hecause of their value, have to be protected from
2§;   contact with the air or the hand; others benefit from being left uncovered." Expo-

On the London world exhibition: ""In making the rounds of' this enormous exhibi­
tion, the observer soon realizes that, to avoid confusion, . . . it has been necessary
to cluster the different nationalities in a certain number of groups, and that the
only useful way of establishing these industrial groupings was to do so on the basis
of-oddly enough-religious beliefs. Each of the great religious divisions of hu­
manity corresponds, in effect, . . . to a particular mode of existence and of indus­
trial activity." Michel Chevalier, Du Progres (Paris, 1852), p. 13.           [G13a,1]

From the first chapter of Capital: "'A commodity appears, at first sight, a very
trivial thing and easily understood. Its analysis shows that in reality it is a very
queer thing, abounding in metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties. So far
as it is a value in use, there is nothing mysterious about it. . . . The form of wood is
altcred by making a table out of it; nevertheless, this table remains wood, an
ordinary material thing. As soon as it steps forth as commodity, however, it is
transformed into a material immaterial thing. It not only stands with its feet on the
ground, but, in the face of all other commodities, it stands on its head, and out of
its wooden brain it evolves notions more whimsically than if it had suddenly begun
to dance."25 Cited in Franz Mehring, ��Karl Marx und das Gleichnis," in Karl
Marx als Denker; Mensch, und Revolutioniir, ed. Rjazanov (Vienna and Berlin

Renan compares the world exhibitions to the great Greek festivals, the Olympian
games, and the Panat.henaea. But in contrast to these, the world exhibitions lack
poetry. "Twice, Europe has gone off to view the merchandisc and to compare
products and materials; and on returning from this new kind of pilgrimage, no one
has complained of missing anything." Some pages later: ��Our century tends to­
ward neither the good nor the had; it tends toward the mediocre. What succeeds in
every endeavor nowadays is mediocrity." Ernest Renan, Essais de morale et de
critique (Paris, 1859), pp. 356-357, 373 ("La Poesie de l'Exposition").  [GI3a,3]

Hashish vision in the casino at Aix-Ia-Chapelle. "The gaming table at Aix-Ia­
Chapelle is nothing short of an international congress, where the coins of all king­
doms and all countries are welcome . . . . A storm of Leopolds, Friedrich Wilhelms,
Queen Victorias, and Napoleons rain down . . . on the table. Looking over this
shining alluvium, I thought I could see . . . the effigies of the sovereigns . . . irrevo­
cably fade from their respective ecus, guineas, or ducats, to make room for other
visages entirely unknown to me. A great many of these faces . . . wore grimaces . . .
of vexation, of greed, or of fury. There were happy ones too, but only a few. . . .
Soon this phenomenon . . . grew dim and passed away, and another sort of vision,
no less extraordinary, now loomed before me . . . . The bourgeois effigies which
had supplanted the monarchs began themselves to move ahout within the metallic
disks . . . that confined them. Before long, they had separated from the disks. They
appeared in full relief; then their heads hurgeoned out into rounded forms. They
had taken on . . . not only faces but living flesh. They had all sprung Lilliputian
bodies. Everything assumed a shape . . . somehow or other; and creatures exaetly
like lIS, except for their size, . . . began to enliven the gaming table, from which all
currency had vanished. I heard the ring of coins struck hy the st.eel of the crou­
pier's rake, but this was all that remained of the old resonance . . . of louis and
ecus, which had become men. These poor myrmidons were now taking to their
heels, frantic at the approach of the murderous rake of the croupier; but escape
was impossible . . . . Then . . . the dwarfish stakes, obliged to admit defeat, were
ruthlessly captured hy the fatal rake, which gathered t.hem into the croupier's
clutching hand. The croupier-how horrihle!-took up each small body daintily
between his fingers and devoured it with gusto. In less than half an hour, I saw
some half-dozen of t.hese imprudent Lilliputians hurled into the abyss of this terl'i-
ble tomb. . . . But what appalled me the most was that, on raising my eyes (alto­
gether by chance) to the gallery surrounding this valley of death � I noticed not just
an extraordinary likeness but a complete identity between the several kingpins
playing the life-sized game and the miniature humans struggling there on the ta­
hIe . . . . What's more, these kingpins . . . appeared to me . . . to collapse in des­
peration precisely as their childlike facsimiles were overtaken hy the formidable
rake. They seemed to share . . . all the sensations of their little doubles; and never,
for as long as I live � will I forget the look and the gesture-full of hatred and
despair-which one of those gamhlers directed toward the hank at the very mo­
ment that his tiny simulacrum � coralled by the rake � went to satisfy the ravenous
appetite of the croupier." Felix Mornand, La Vie des eaux (Paris, 1862), pp. 219-

It would be useful to compare the way Grandville portrays machines to the way
Chevalier, in 1852, still speaks of the railroad.He calculates that two locomo­
tives, having a total of 400 horsepower, would correspond to 800 actual horses.
How would it be possible to harness them up? How supply the fodder? And, in a
note, he adds: "It must also be kept in mind that horses of flesh and blood have
to rest after a brief journey; so that to furnish the same service as a locomotive,
one must have on hand a very large number of animals:' Michel Chevaliel;

A divinatory representation of architectural aspects of the later world exhibitions
is found in Gogo!'s essay "On Present-Day Architecture;' which appeared in the
mid-Thirties in his collection Arabesques. ''Away with this academicism which
commands that buildings be built all one size and in one style! A city should
consist of many different styles of building, if we wish it to be pleasing to the eye.
Let as many contrasting styles combine there as possible! Let the solemn Gothic
and the richly embellished Byzantine arise in the sanle street, alongside colossal
Egyptian halls and elegantly proportioned Greek structures! Let us see there the
slightly concave milk-white cupola, the soaring church steeple, the oriental miter,
the Italianate flat roof, the steep and heavily ornamented Flemish roof, the quad­
rilateral pyTarnid, the cylindrical column, the faceted obelisk!"" Nikolai Gogol,

consuming, learned empathy with exchange value. "Look at everything; touch

Here was the last refuge of those infant prodigies that saw the light of day at the
time of the world exhibitions : the briefcase with interior lighting, the meter-long
pocket knife, or the patented umbrella haudle with built-in watch and revolver.
And near the degenerate giant creatures, aborted and broken-down matter. We
followed the narrow dark corridor to where-between a discount bookstore, in
which dusty tied-up bundles tell of all sorts of failure, and a shop selling only
buttons (mother-of-pearl and the kind that in Paris are called defonlaisie)-there
stood a sort of salon. On the pale-colored Wallpaper full of figures and busts
shone a gas lamp. By its light, an old woman sat reading. They say she has been
there alone for years, and collects sets of teeth "in gold, in wax, and broken!'
Since that day, moreover, we know where Doctor Miracle got the wax out of
which he fashioned Olympia.' 0 Dolls 0                                        [H!,!]

"The crowd throngs to the Passage Vivierme, where people never feel conspicu­

At a certain point, an attempt was made to entice the crowd back by filling the
rotunda each evening with hannoruous music, which emanated invisibly from
the windows of a mezzanine. But the crowd came to put its nose in at the door
and did not enter, suspecting in this novelty a conspiracy against its customs and
routine pleasures." Le Livre des cenl-e/-un, vol. 10 (Paris, 1833), p. 58. Fifteen
years ago, a similar attempt was made-likewise in vain-to boost the <Berlin>

Never trust what writers say about their own writings. When Zola undertook to
defend his TMrese Raquin against hostile critics, he explained that his book was a
scientific study of the temperaments. His task had been to show, in an example,
exactly how the sanguine and the nervous temperaments act on one another-to
the detriment of each. But this explanation could satisfy no one.Nor does it
explain the admixture of colportage, the bloodthirstiness, the cinematic goriness
of the action. Which-by no accident-takes place in an arcade.' If this book
really expounds something scientifically, then it's the death of the Paris arcades,
the decay of a type of architecture. The book's atmosphere is saturated with the
poisons of this process: its people drop like flies.                          [HI,3]

Music seems to have settled into these spaces only with their decline, only as the
orchestras themselves began to seem old-fashioned in comparison to the new
mechanical music. So that, in fact, these orchestras would just as soon have taken
refuge there. (The "theatrophone)) in the arcades was, in certain respects, the
forerunner of the gramophone.) Nevertheless, there was music that conformed
to the spirit of the arcades-a panoramic music, such as can be heard today only
in old-fashioned genteel concerts like those of the casino orchestra in Monte
Carlo: the panoramic compositions of <FeJiciem David, for example-Le Desert,
Christoph Colomb, Herculanum. When, in the 1860s (?), an Arab political delega­

Often these inner spaces harbor antiquated trades, and even those that are
tlloroughly up to date will acquire in them something obsolete. ]lley are the site

What is decisive in collecting is that the object is detached from all its original
functions in order to enter into the closest conceivable relation to things of the
same kind. This relation is tl,e diametric opposite of any utility, and faUs into the
peculiar category of completeness. What is tins "completeness"? It is a grand
attempt to overcome the wholly irrational character of the object's mere presence
at hand through its integration into a new, expressly devised historical system:
the collection. And for the true collector, every single thing in this system be­
comes an encyclopedia of all knowledge of the epoch, the landscape, the indus­
try, and the owner from which it comes. It is the deepest enchantment of the
collector to enclose the particular item within a magic circle, where, as a last
shudder mns through it (the shudder of being acquired), it turns to stone. Every­
thing remembered, everything thought, everything conscious becomes socle,
frame, pedestal, seal of his possession. It must not be assumed that the collector,
in particular, would find anything strange in the topos hyperouranios-that place
beyond the heavens which, for Plato,' shelters the unchangeable archetypes of
things. He loses himself, assuredly. But he has the strength to pull himself up
again by nothing more than a straw; and from out of the sea of fog that envelops
his senses rises the newly acquired piece, like an island.-Collecting is a form of
practical memory, and of all the profane manifestations of "nearness" it is the
most binding. Thus, in a certain sense, the smallest act of political reflection
makes for an epoch in the antiques business. We construct here an alarm clock
that rouses the kitsch of the previous century to "assembly:'                 [HIa,2]

Extinct nature: the shell shop in the arcades. In "The Pilot's Trials;' Strindberg
tells of "an arcade with brightly lit shops." "Then he went on into the arcade. . . .
There was every possible kind of shop, but not a soul to be seen, either behind or
before the counters. After a while he stopped in front of a big window in which
there was a whole display of shells. As the door was open, he went in. From floor
to ceiling there were rows of shells of every kind, collected from all the seas of the
world. No one was in, but there was a ring of tobacco smoke in the air. . . . So he
began his walk again, following the blue and white carpet. The passage wasn't
straight but winding, so that you could never see the end of it; and there were
always fresh shops there, but no people; and the shopkeepers were not to be
seen:' The unfathomability of the moribund arcades is a characteristic motif.

One must make one's way through Les Fleurs du mal with a sense for how things

At the conclusion of Matiere et memoire, Bergson develops the idea that perception
is a function of time. If, let us say, we were to live vis�a�vis some things more
cahnly and vis-it-vis others mOre rapidly, according to a different rhythm, there
would be nothing "subsistent" for us, but instead everything would happen right
before our eyes; everything would strike us. But this is the way things are for the
great collector. They strike him. How he himself pursues and encounters them,
what changes in the ensemble of items are effected by a newly supervening
item-all this shows him his affairs in constant flux. Here, the Paris arcades are
exantined as though they were properties in the hand of a collector. (At bottom,
we may say, the collector lives a piece of dream life. For in the dream, too, the
rhythm of perception and experience is altered in such a way that everything­
even the seemingly most neutral-comes to strike us; everything concerns us. In
order to understand the arcades from the ground up, we sink them into the
deepest stratum of the dream; we speak of them as though they had struck us.)

The tme method of making things present is to represent them in our space (not
to represent ourselves in their space). (The collector does just this, and so does
the anecdote.) Thus represented, the things allow no mediating construction

Fundamentally a very odd fact-that collector's items as such were produced
industrially. Since when? It would be necessary to investigate the various fash­
ions that governed collecting in the nioeteenth century. Characteristic of the
Biedermeier period (is this also the case in France?) is the mania for cups and
saucers. "Parents, children, friends, relatives, superiors, and subordinates Inake
their feelings known through cups and saucers. The cup is the preferred gift, the
most popular kiod of knickknack for a room. Just as Friedrich Wilhelm III filled
his study with pyramids of porcelain cups, the ordinary citizen collected, io the
cups and saucers of his sideboard, the memory of the most important events, the
most precious hours, of his life." Max von Boehn, Die Mode im XIX. Jahrhun­

One may start from the fact that the true collector detaches the object from its
functional relations. But that is hardly an exhaustive description of this remark­
able mode of behavior. For isn't this the foundation (to speak with Kant and
Schopenhauer) of that "disinterested" contemplation by virtue of which the col­
lector attains to an unequaled view of the object-a view which takes in more,
and other, than that of the profane owner and which we would do best to
compare to d,e gaze of the gteat physiognomist? But how his eye comes to rest
on the object is a matter elucidated much more sharply through another consid­
eration. It must be kept in mind that, for the collector, the world is present, and
indeed ordered, in each of his objects. Ordered, however, according to a surpris­
ing and, for the profane understanding, incomprehensible c011llection. 11ris con­
nection stands to the customary ordering and schematization of things something
as their alTangement in the dictionary stands to a natural arrangement. We need
only recall what importance a particular collector attaches not only to his object
but also to its entire past, whedler this concerns the origin and objective charac­
teristics of the thing or the details of its ostensibly external history: previous
owners, price of purchase, current value, and so on. All of these-the "objective"
data together with the other-come togethel; for the true collector, in every
single one of his possessions, to form a whole magic encyclopedia, a world order,
whose outline is thefite of his object. Here, therefore, within this circumscribed
field, we can understand how gteat physiognomists (and collectors are physiog­
nOnUsts of the world of things) become interpreters of fate. It suffices to observe
just one collector as he handles the items in his showcase. No sooner does he
hold them in his hand than he appears inspired by them and seems to look
through them into their distance, like an augur. (It would be interesting to study
the bibliophile as the only type of collector who has not completely withdrawn
his treasures from their functional context.)                          [H2,7; H2a,!]

The great collector Paclringer, Wolfskehl's friend, has put together a collection

in Vie11lla. He hardly knows any more how things stand in the world; explains to
his visitors-alongside d,e most antique implements-dle use of pocket handker­
chiefs, hand mirrors, and the like. It is related of him that, one day, as he was
crossing the Stachus, he stooped to pick something up. Before him lay ,m object

impossible. ' . . . Yet Dickens recognized that the possibility of transition and dia­
lectical rescue was inherent in this world of things, this lost, rejected world; and he
expressed it, better than Romantic nature-worship was ever able to do, in the
powerful allegory of money with which the depiction of the industrial city ends:
' . . . two old, hattered, smoke-encrusted penny pieces. Who knows but they shone
as brightly in the eyes of angels , as golden gifts that have been chronicled on

"'Most enthusiasts let themselves be guided by chance in forming their collection,

what he wanted to possess . . . . And what was the point? To arrange around him­

square meters, Rome and Florence, Pompeii and Venice, Dresden and the Hague,
the Vatican and the Escorial. the British Museum and the Hermitage, the Alham­

project with only modest expenditures made each year over a thirty-year pe­
riod . . . . Seeking, in particular, to adorn the walls of his residence with the most
precious souvenirs of his voyages, M. Thiel'S had reduced copies made of the most
famous paintings . . . . And so, on entering his home, you find yourself immediately

The positive countertype to the collector-which also, insofar as it entails the
liberation of things from the drudgery of being useful, represents the consumma­

when it exists as capital for us, or when . . . we use ie' Karl Marx, Der historische

The collector actualizes latent archaic representations of property. T11ese repre­

emotively and 'sincerelY; then as a routine legal process, declaring something
taboo would have constituted a title. To appropriate to oneself an object is to
render it sacred and redoubtable to others; it is to make it 'participate' in oneself."

The physiological side of collecting is important. In the analysis of this behavior,
it should not be overlooked that, with the nest-building of birds, collecting ac·
quires a clear biological function. There is apparently an indication to this effect
in Vasari1s treatise on architecture. Pavlov, too, is supposed to have occupied
himself with collecting.                                                         [H4, 1]

Vasari is supposed to have maintained (in his treatise on architecture?) that
the term ""grotesque" comes from the grottoes in which collectors hoard their
treasures.                                                             [H4,2]

Collecting is a primal phenomenon of study: the student collects knowledge.
[H4,3]

In elucidating the relation of medieval man to his affairs, Huizinga occasionally
adduces the literary genre of the "testament": "This literary fonn can be . . .
appreciated only by someone who remembers that the people of the Middle Ages
were, in fact, accustomed to dispose of even the meanest [I] of their possessions
through a separate and detailed testament. A poor woman bequeathed her Sun·
day dress and cap to her parish, her bed to her godchild, a fur to her nurse, her
everyday dress to a beggar woman, and four pounds tournois (a sum which
constituted her entire fortune), together with an additional dress and cap, to the
Franciscan mars (Champion, Villon, vol. 2, p. 182). Shouldn't we recognize here,
too, a quite trivial manifestation of the same cast of mind that sets up every case
of virtue as an eternal example and sees in every customary practice a divinely
willed ordinance?" J. Huizinga, HerbJt deJ MillelalterJ (Munich, 1928), p. 346."
What strikes one most about this noteworthy passage is that such a relation to
movables would perhaps no longer be possible in an age of standardized mass
production. It would follow quite naturally from this to ask whether or not the
forms of argumentation to which the author alludes, and indeed certain forms of
Scholastic thought in general (appeal to hereditary authoritary) , belong together
with the forms of production. The collector develops a similar relationship with
his objects, which are enriched through his knowledge of their origin and their
duration in history-a relationship that now seems archaic.                      [H4,4]

Perhaps the most deeply hidden motive of the person who collects can be de­
scribed this way: he takes up the struggle against dispersion. Right from the start,
the great collector is struck by the confusion, by the scatter, in which the things of
the world are found. It is the same spectacle that so preoccupied the men of the
Baroque; in particular, the world iroage of the allegorist carmot be explained
apart from the passionate, distraught concern with this spectacle. The allegorist
is, as it were, the polar opposite of the collector. He has given up the attempt to
elucidate things through research into their properties and relations. He dis­
lodges things from their context and, from the outset, relies on his profundity to
illuminate their meaning. The collector, by contrast, brings together what be­
longs together; by keeping in mind their affinities and their succession in time, he
can eventually furnish infonnation about his objects. Nevertheless-and this is
more important than all the differences that may exist between them-in every
collector hides an allegorist, and in every allegorist a collector. As far as the
collector is concerned, his collection is never complete; for let him discover just a
single piece missing, and everything he's collected remains a patchwork, which is
what things are for allegory from the beginning. On the other hand, the allego­
rist-for whom objects represent only keywords in a secret dictionary, which will
make known their meanings to the initiated-precisely the allegorist can never
have enough of things. With him, one thing is so little capable of taking the place
of another that no possible reflection suffices to foresee what meaning his profun­
dity might lay clainl to for each one of them."                                [H4a,1]

Aninlals (birds, ants), children, and old men as collectors.                   [H4a,2]

A sort of productive disorder is the canon of the mhnoire invalontaireJ as it is the
canon of the collector. "And I had already lived long enough so that, for more
than one of the human beings with whom I had come in contact, I found in
antipodal regions of my past memories another being to complete the picture. . . .
In much the same way, when an art lover is shown a panel of an altar screen, he
renlenlbers in what church, lTIUSeUID, and private collection the other panels are
dispersed (likewise, he finally succeeds, by following the catalogues of art sales or
frequenting antique shops, in finding the mate to the object he possesses and
thereby completing the pair, and so can reconstruct in his mind the predella and
the entire altar) ;' Marcel Proust, Le Temps reirouve (Paris), vol. 2, p. 158.17 The
mernoire volontaire, on the other hand, is a registry providing the object with a clas­
sificatory number behind which it disappears. "So now we've been there." ("I've
had an experience.") How the scatter of allegorical properties (the patchwork)
relates to this creative disorder is a question calling for further study.      [HS,l]

" In 1830, Romanticism was gaining the upper hand in literature. It now invaded
architecture and placarded house fa�ades with a fantastic gothicism, one all too
often made of pasteboard. It imposed itself 011 furniture making. 'All of a sudden,'
says a reporter on the exhibition of' 1834" 'there is boundless enthusiasm for
strangely shaped furniture. From old chateaux, from furniture warehouses and
junk shops, it has been dragged out to embellish the salons, which in every other
respect are modern . . . . ' Feeling inspired, furniture manufacturers have been
prodigal with their 'ogives and machicolations.' You see beds and armoires bris­
tling with battlements, like thirteenth-century citadels." E. I..Jcvasseur, <fIistoire

Apropos of a medieval armoire, this interesting remark from Behne: "Movables
<furniture> quite clearly developed out of immovables <real estate>:' The annoire
is compared to a "medieval fortress. Just as, in the latter, a tiny dwelling space is
surrounded in ever-widening rings by walls, ramparts, and moats, forming a
gigantic outwork, so the contents of the drawers and shelves in the armoire are
overwhehned by a mighty outwork." Adolf Behne, Neues Wohnen-lV'eues Bauen
(Leipzig, 1927), pp. 59, 61-62.                                                [1 l,2]

Ine importance of movable property, as compared with immovable property.
Here our task is slightly easier. Easier to blaze a way into the heart of things
abolished or superseded, in order to decipher the contours of the banal as picture
puzzle-in order to start a concealed William Tell from out of wooded entrails, or
in order to be able to answer the question, "Where is the bride in this picture?"
Picture puzzles, as schemata of dreamwork, were long ago discovered by psycho­
analysis. We, however, with a similar conviction, are less on the trail of the psyche
than on the track of things. We seek the totemic tree of objects within the thicket
of prinlal history. The very last-the topmost-face on the totem pole is that of
kitsch.                                                                          [II,3]

Hessel speaks of the "dreamy epoch of bad taste;' Yes, this epoch was wholly
adapted to the dream, was fumished in dreams. 'The altemation in styles­
Gothic, Persian, Renaissance, and so on-signified: that over the interior of the
middle-class dining room spreads a banquet room of Cesare Borgia's, or that out
of the boudoir of the mistress a Gothic chapel arises, or that the master's study, in
its iridescence, is transformed into the chamber of a Persian prince. The photo­
montage that fixes such images for us corresponds to the most primitive percep­
tual tendency of these generations. Only gradually have the images anlong
which they lived detached themselves and settled on sigos, labels, posters, as the
figures of advertising.                                                           [11,6]

A series of lithographs from 18<-> showed women reclining voluptuously on
ottomans in a draperied, crepuscular boudoir, and these prints bore inscriptions:
On the Banks ofthe Tagus, On the Banks 'ifthe Neva, On the Banks ofthe Seine, and
so forth. The Guadalquivir, the Rhone, the Rhine, the Aar, the Tamis-all had
their tum. That a national costume might have distinguished these female figures
one from another may be safely doubted. It was up to the legende, the caption
inscribed beneath them, to conjure a fantasy landscape over the represented
interiors.                                                                        [11,7]

TIrreshold magic. At the entrance to the skating rink, to the pub, to the tennis
court, to resort locations : penates. The hen that lays the golden praline-eggs, the
machine that stamps our names on nameplates, slot machines, fortunetelling
devices, and above all weighing devices (the Delphic gMthi seauton' of our day)­
..
these guard the threshold. Oddly, such machines don't flourish in the city, but
rather are a component of excursion sites, of beer gardens in the suburbs. And
when, in search of a little greenery, one heads for these places on a Sunday
afternoon, one is turning as well to the mysterious thresholds. Of course, this
same magic prevails more covertly in the interior of the bourgeois dwelling.
Chairs beside an entrance, photographs flanking a doorway, are fallen household
deities, and the violence they must appease grips our hearts even today at each
ringing of the doorbell. Try, though, to withstand the violence. Alone in an
apartment, try not to bend to the insistent ringing. You will find it as difficult as
an exorcism. Like all magic substance, this too is once again reduced at some
point to sex-in pornography. Around 1830, Paris amused itself with obscene
lithos that featured sliding doors and windows. These were the Images dites it

Concerning the dreamy and, if possible, oriental interior: "'Everyone here dreams

of sudden metamorphoses in domestic existence; they all rave about marquises
and princesses, about the prodigies of the Thou.sand and One Nights. It is an
opium trance that has overspread the whole population, and industry is more to
blame for this than poetry. Industry was responsible for the swindle in the Stoek
Exehange, the exploitation of all things made to serve artificial needs, and the . . .
dividends." Gutzkow, Briefe au.s Paris <Leipzig, 1842>, vol. 1, p. 93.         (Ila,S]

On the exhibition of 1867. �"These high galleries, kilometers in length, were of an

tempts were made-through furniture-like installations-to prettify these twenty­
five-meter-high galleries and to relieve the austerity of their design. One stood in
fear of one's own magnitude." Sigfried Giedion, Bauen in Frankreich <Leipzig and

On the ideal of "distinction;' "Everything tends toward the flourish, toward the
curve, toward intricate convolution. What the reader does not perhaps gather at
first sight, however, is that dus manner of laying and arranging dUngs also incor­
porates a setting apart-one that leads us back to the knight. I The carpet in the
foreground lies at an angle, diagonally. The chairs are likewise arranged at an
angle, diagonally. Now, dns could be a coincidence. But if we were to meet widl
dns propensity to situate objects at an angle and diagonally in all the dwellings of
all classes and social strata-as, in fact, we do-then it can be no coincidence. . . .
hl the first place, arranging at an angle enforces a distinction-and this, once
more, in a quite literal sense. By the obliquity of its position, the object sets itself
off from the ensemble, as the carpet does here. . . . But the deeper explanation for
all this is, again, the unconscious retention of a posture of struggle and defense. I
In order to defend a piece of ground, I place myself expressly on the diagonal,
because then I have a free view on two sides. It is for this reason that the bastions
of a fortification are constructed to form salient angles. . . . And doesn't the
carpet, in dns position, recall such a bastion? . . . I Just as the knight, suspecting
an attack, positions himself crosswise to guard both left and right, so the peace­
loving burgher, several centuries later, orders his art ohjects in such a way that
each one, if only by standing out from all the rest, has a wall and moat surround­
ing it. He is thus truly a Spiessbilrger, a militant philistine." Adolf Belme, Neues
Wohnen-N'eues Bauen (Leipzig, 1927), pp. 45-48. In elucidating dus point, the
author remarks half-seriously: "The gendemen who could afford a villa wanted
to mark their higher standing. What easier way than hy borrowing feudal forms,
knighdy fomls?" (ibid., p. 42). More universal is Lukacs' remark that, from the
perspective of the philosophy of history, it is characteristic of the wddle classes
that their new opponent, the proletariat, should have entered the arena at a
moment when the old adversary, feudalism, was not yet vanquished. And they
will never quite have done with feudalism.                                        [12,3J

Nineteenth-century domestic interior. The space disguises itself-puts on, like an
alluring creature, the costumes of moods. The self-satisfied burgher should know
something of the feeling that the next room might have witnessed the coronation
of Charlemagne as well as the assassination of Henri Iv, the signing of the Treaty
of Verdun as well as the wedding of Otto and Theophano. In the end, things are
merely matmequins, and even the great moments of world history are only
costumes beneath which they exchange glances of complicity with nothingness,
with the petty and the banal. Such nihilism is the innermost core of bourgeois
coziness-a 11100d that in hashish intoxication concentrates to satanic content-
11lent, satanic knowing, satanic calm, indicating precisely to what extent the
nineteenth-century interior is itself a stimulus to intoxication and dream. This
mood involves, furthermore, an aversion to the open air, the (so to speak) Ura­
nian atmosphere, which throws a new light on the extravagant interior design of
the period. To live in these interiors was to have woven a dense fabric about
oneself, to have secluded oneself within a spider's web, in whose toils world
events hang loosely suspended like so many insect bodies sucked dry. From this
cavern, one does not like to stir.'                                              [12,6]

An observation from the year 183Z "In those days, the classical style reigned,
just as the rococo does today. With a stroke of its magic wand, fashion . . .
transfonned the salon into an atrium, armchairs into cunlle seats, dresses with
trains into tunics, drinking glasses into goblets, shoes into buskins, and guitars
into lyres." Sophie Gay, Der Salon der Fraulein Contet (in Europa: Chronik de}'
gebildeten Welt, ed. August Lewald, vol. 1 [Leipzig and Stuttgart, 1837], p. 358).
Hence the following: "What is the height of embarrassment?" "When you bring
a harp to a party and no one asks you to play it:' This piece of drollery, which
also illuminates a certain type of interior, probably dates from the First Empire.

"As to Baudelaire's 'stage properties'-which were no doubt modeled on the
fashion in interior decoration of his day-they might provide a useful lesson for
those elegant ladies of the past twenty years, who used to pride themselves that
not a single 'false note' was to be found in their town houses. They would do well
to consider, when they contemplate the alleged purity of style which they have
achieved with such infinite trouble, that a man may be the greatest and most
artistic of writers, yet describe nothing but beds with 'adjustable curtains' . . . ,
halls like conservatories . . . , beds filled with subtle scents, sofas deep as tombs,
whatnots loaded with flowers, lamps burning so briefly . . . that the only light
comes from the coal fire:' Marcel Proust, Chroniques (Paris <1927,), pp. 224-2257
(the titles ofwarks cited are omitted) . These remarks are in,portant because they
make it possible to apply to the interior an antinomy formulated witll regard to
museums and town planning-nanlely, to confront the new style with the mysti­
cal-nihilistic expressive power of the traditional, tl,e "antiquated:' Which of these
two alternatives Proust would have chosen is revealed not only by this passage, it
may be added, but by the whole of his work (compare re,ye17ne-"closed-up;'

Desideratum: the derivation of genre painting. W1,at function did it serve in the

these spaces would no longer, in general, welcome pictures. "Genre painting. . . .
Conceived in this way, art could not fail to resort to the specialties so suited to the

Wiesengrund cites and comments on a passage from the Diary of a Seducer-a
passage that he considers the key to Kierkegaard's "'entire oeuvre": " Environment.
and setting still have a great inHuence upon one; there is something ahout them
which stamps itself firmly and deeply in the memory, or rather upon the whole
soul, and which is therefore never forgotten. However old I may become, it will
always he impossible for me to think of Cordelia amid surroundings different from
this little room. When I come to visit her, the maid admits me to the hall� Cordelia
herself comes in from her room, and, just as I open the door to enter the living
room, she opens her door, so that our eyes meet exactly in the doorway. The living
room is small, comfortable, little more than a cahinet. Although I have now seen it
from many different viewpoints, the one dearest to me is the view from the sofa.
She sits there by my side; in front of us stands a round tea table, over which is
draped a rich tahlecloth. On the tahle stands a lamp shaped like a Hower, which
shoots up vigorously to bear its crown, over which a delicately cut paper shade
hangs down so lightly that it is never still. The lamp's form reminds one of oriental
lands; the shade's movement, of' mild oriental breezes. The floor is concealed hy a
carpet woven from a certain kind of osier, which immediately hetrays its foreign
origin. For the moment, I let the lamp become the keynote of my landscape. I am
sitting there with her outstretdled on the floor, under the lamp's flowering. At
other times I let the osier rug evoke thoughts of a ship, of an officer's cahin-we
sail out into the middle of the great ocean. When we sit at a distance from the
window, we gaze directly into heaven's vast horizon . . . . Cordelia's environment
must have no foreground, hut only the infinite boldness of far horizons" (Gesmn­
melte Schriften <properly: Werke (Jena, 1911» , vol. 1 , pp. 348-349 [Either/Or]).
Wiesengrund remarks: "Just us external history is 'reflected' in internal history,
semblance < Schein> is in the interieur spa(�e. IGerkegaard no more discerned the
element of semhlance in all merely reflected and reflect.ing intrasuhjective reality
than he sees through the semblance of the spatial in the image of the interior. But
here he is exposed by the material. . . . The contents of the interior are mere
decoration, alienated from the purposes they represent, deprived of their own use
value, engendered solely by the isolated dwelling-space . . . . The self is over­
whelmed in its own domain by commodities and their historical essence. Their
semblance-character is historically-economically produced hy the alienation of
thing from use value. But in the interior, things do not remain alien . . . . Foreign­
ness transforms itself from alienated things into expression; mute things speak as
�symbols.' The ordering of things in the dwelling-space is called 4 arrangement.'
Historically illusory <Geschichtlich scheinhaJte> ohjects are arranged in it as the sem­

blance of unchangeable nature. In the interior� archaic images unfold: the image of
the flower as that of organic life; the image of the orient as specifically the home­

The bourgeois who came into ascendancy with Louis Philippe sets store by the
transfomlation of nature into the interior. In 1839, a ball is held at the British
embassy. Two hundred rOse bushes are ordered. "The garden;' so runs an eye­
witness account, "was covered by an awning and had the feel of a drawing room.
But what a drawing room! The fragrant, well-stocked Hower beds had turned
into enormousjardinieres, the graveled walks had clisappeared under sumptuous
carpets, and in place of the cast-iron benches we found sofas covered in damask
and silk; a round table held books and albums. From a distance, the strains of an
orchestra drifted into this colossal boudoir:'                                     [14,1]

The difficulty in reHecting on dwelling: on the one hand, there is something
age-old-perhaps eternal-to be recognized here, the image of that abode of the
human being in the maternal womb; on the other hand, this motif of primal
history notwithstanding, we must understand dwelling in its most extreme form
as a conclition of nineteenth-century existence. The original form of all dwelling
is existence not in the house but in the shell. Tbe shell bears the impression of its
occupant. In the most extreme instance, the dwelling becomes a shell. The nine­
teenth century, like no other century, was addicted to dwelling. It conceived the
residence as a receptacle for the person, and it encased him with all his appurte­
nances so deeply in the dwelling's interior that one might be reminded of the
inside of a compass case, where the instnllnent with alI its accessories lies enlbed­
ded in deep, usually violet folds of velvet. What didn't the nineteenth century
invent some sort of casing for! Pocket watches, slippers, egg cups, thermometers,
playing cards-and, in lieu of cases, there were jackets, carpets, wrappers, and
covers. The twentieth century, with its porosity and transparency, its tendency
toward the well-lit and airy, has put an end to dwelling in the old sense. Set off
against the doll house in the residence of the master builder Solness are the
,
"homes for human beings: Ji Jugendstil unsettled the world of the shell in a
radical way. Today tlns world has disappeared entirely, and dwelling has dinlln·
ished: for the living, through hotel rooms; for the dead, through crematoriums.

Perhaps there is a connection between the shrinking of residential space and the
elaborate furnishing of the interior. Regarding the first, Balzac makes some telling
observations : "Small pictures alone are in demand because large ones can no
longer be hung. Soon it will be a formidable problem to house one's library. . . .
One can no longer fmd space for provisions of any sort. Hence, one buys things
that are not calculated to wear well. 'The shirts and the books won't last, so there
you are. The durability of products is disappearing on all sides:" Ernst Robert
Curtius, Balzac (Bonn, 1923), pp. 28-29.                                  [I6,5]

'''Sunsets cast their glowing colors on the walls of dining room and drawing room,
filtering softly through lovely hangings or intricate high windows with mullioned
panes. All the furniture is immense, fantastic, strange, armed with locks and
secrets like all civilized souls. Mirrors, metals, fabrics, pottery, and works of the
goldsmith's art play a mute mysterious symphony for the eye." Charles Baude­

Multiplication of traces through the modem administrative apparatus. Balzac
draws attention to this: "Do your utInost, hapless Frenchwomen, to remain
unknown, to weave the very least little romance iu the midst of a civilization
which takes note, on public squares, of the hour when every hackney cab comes
and goes; which counts every letter and stamps them twice, at the exact time they
are posted and at the time they are delivered; which numbers the houses . . . ;
which ere long will have every acre of land, down to the smallest holdiugs . . . ,
laid down on the broad sheets of a survey-a giant's task, by command of a
giant." Balzac, Modeste Mignon," cited iu Regis Messac, Le "Detective Novel" <et

" Victor Hugo works standing up, and, since he cannot find a suitable antique to
serve as his desk, he writes on a stack of stools and large books which is covered
with a carpet. It is on the Bible, it is on the Nuremberg Chronicles, that the poet
leans and spreads his paper." Louis Ulhach, Les Contemporains (Paris, 1833),
cited in Raymond Escholier, Victor Hugo raconte par ceux qui l'ont Vlt (Paris,
1931), p. 352.                                                                 [17, 1]

There is an apocalyptic interior-a complement, as it were, of the bourgeois
interior at midcentury. It is to be found with Victor Hugo. He Wl�tes of spiritual-
istic manifestations: "I have been checked for a moment in my miserable human
amour-propre by actual revelation, comiug to throw around my little miuer's lamp
a streak of lightning and of meteor." In Les Contemplations, he writes:
We listen for any sounds in these dismal empty spaces;
Wandering through the shadows, we listen to the breath
TI,at makes the darkness shudder;
And now and then, lost in unfathomable nights,
We see lit up by mighty lights
The window of eternity.

The relation of the Jugendstil interior to its predecessors comes down to the fact
that the bourgeois conceals his alibi in history with a still more remote alibi in

On the history of the domestic interior. The residential character of the rooms in
the early factories, though disconcerting and inexpedient, adds this homely
touch: that within these spaces one can imagine the factory owner as a quaint
figurine in a landscape of machines, dreaming not only of his own but of their
future greatness. With the dissociation of the proprietor from the workplace, this
characteristic of factory buildings disappears. Capital alienates the employer, too,
from his means of production, and the dream of their future greatness is finished.
Tbis alienation process culminates in the emergence of the private home.

��During the first decades of the nineteenth century, furniture and the objects that
surrounded us for use and pleasure were relatively simple and durable, and ac­
corded with the needs of hoth the lower and the upper strata. This resulted in
people's attaclunent, as they grew up, to the objects of their surroundings . . . . The
differentiation of objects has broken down this situation in three different
ways . . . . First, the sheer quantity of very specifically formed ohjects make a close
. . . relationship to each of them more difficult. . . . This is expressed . . . in the
housewife's complaint that the care of the household becomes ceremonial fetish­
ism . . . . This concurrent differentiation has the same effect as consecutive differ-
entiation. Changes in fashion disrupt that . . . process of . . . assimilation between
subject and object . . . . [In the third place, tbere is 1 the multitude of styles that

the artificial superiority of a man of pen and ink to the men who grapple with

On the theory of the trace. Practice is eliminated from the productive process by
machinery. In the process of administration, somethiug analogous oCCurs with

when one compares Conrad's observations iu "The Shadow-Liue" with a pas­

On the theory of the trace: administration iu the eighteenth century. As secretary
to the French embassy in Venice, Rousseau had abolished the tax on passports
for the French. "As soon as the news got around that I had reformed the passport
tax, my ouly applicants were crowds of pretended Frenchmen who claimed iu
abomiuable accents to be either from Provence, Picardy, or Burgundy. As I have
a fairly good ear, I was not easily fooled, and I doubt whether a single Italian

great poet, but neither a Lamartine nor a Hugo nor a Musset. ' I do not say that
these words were consciously formulated, but they must have heen latent in
Baudelaire's mind; they even constituted what was the essential Baudelaire. They
were his raison d'etat. . . . Baudelaire considered Victor Hugo; and it is not impos­
sible to imagine what he thought of him . . . . Everything that might scandalize, and
thereby instruct and guide a pitiless young observer in the way of his own future
art, . . . Baudelaire must have recorded in his mind, distinguishing the admiration
forced upon him by Hugo's wonderful gifts from the impurities, the impru­
dences, . . . that is to say, the chances for life and fame that so great an artist left

"'Baudelaire . . . can still write, in 1852, in the preface to Dupont's Chansons: 'Art
was thereafter inseparable from morality and utility. ' And he speaks there of the
'puerile Utopia of the school of art for art's sake.'6 . . Nevertheless, he changes
.



his mind soon after 1852. This conception of social art may perhaps be explained
by his youthful relations. Dupont was his friend at the moment when Baudelaire,
' almost fanatically republican under the monarchy,' was meditating a realistic
and communicatory poetry." C . L. de Liefde, I.e Saint-Simonisme dans la poesie

Baudelaire soon forgot the February Revolution.7 Telling evidence of this fact has

Morsels> (Mercure de France, vol. 262, no. 894" p. 525), in the form of a review of'
the Histoire de Neuilly et de ses chateaux, by the abbe Bellanger, a review which
Baudelaire probably composed at the request of his friend the lawyer Ancelle, and
which at the time presumably appeared in the press. There Baudelaire speaks of
the history of the place " from Roman times to the terrible days of February, when
the chateau was the theater and spoil of the most ignoble passions, of orgy and
destruction. "                                                              [JI a,2]

Baudelaire to POlllet-Malassis, on January 8, 1860, after a visit from Meryon:
" After he left me, I wondered how it was that I, who have always had the mind and
the nerves to go mad, have never actually gone mad. In all seriousness, I gave
heaven a Pharisee's thanks for this."9 Cited in Gustave Geffroy, Charles Meryon
(Paris, 1926), p. 128.                                                      [Jla,5]

From the <eighth} section of Baudelaire's " Salon de 1859." There onc finds, apro­
pos of Meryon, this phrase: " the profound and complex charm of a capital city
which has grown old and worn in the glories and tribulations of life." A little
further on: '1.1 have rarely seen the natural solemnity of an immense city more
poetically reproduced. Those majestic accumulations of stone; those spires �whose
fingers point to heaven'; those obelisks of industry, spewing forth their conglom­
erations of smoke against the firmament; those prodigies of scaffolding 'round
buildings under repair, applying their openwork architecture, so paradoxically
beautiful, upon architecture's solid body; that tumultuous sky, charged with an­
ger and spite; those limitless perspectives, only increased by the thought of all the
drama they contain;-he forgot not one of the complex elements which go to make
up the painful and glorious decor of civilization . . . . But a cruel demon has
touched M.. Meryon's brain . . . . Alld from that moment we have never ceased
waiting anxiously for some consoling news of this singular naval officer who in one
short day turned into a mighty artist, and who bade farewell to the ocean's solemn
adventures in order to paint the gloomy majesty of this most disquieting of capi­
tals."10 Cited in Gustave Geffroy, Charles Meryon (Paris, 1926), pp. 125-126.

The editor Delatte conceived a plan to publish an album of Meryon 's etchings with
text by Baudelaire. The plan fell through; but it had already been ruined for
Baudelaire when Meryon demanded, instead of a text suited to the poet, a pedan­
tic explication of the pictured monuments. Baudelaire complains of the matter in
his letter of Fehruary 16, 1860, to Poulet-Malassis.                        [J2,2]

Here lies the exact likeness
Of the late Pont-Neuf,
All newly refurbished

tial Baudelaire. They were his ra.ison d'etat. In the domain of creation � which is
also the domain of pride, the need to come out and be distinct is part of life itself."

Baudelaire on the child raised in the company of the Pagan School: �'His soul,

A passage from the portrait of Victor Hugo in which Baudelaire, like an engraver
who sketches his own image in a remarque, has portrayed himself in a subordi·
nate clause: "If he paints the sea, no seascape will equal his. The ships which
furrow its surface or which cut through its foam will have, more than those of
any other painter, the appearance of fierce combatants, the character of will and
of animality which mysteriously emerges from a geometric and mechanical appa­
ratus of wood, iron, ropes, and canvas; a monstrous animal created by man to
which the wind and the waves add the beauty of movement:' Baudelaire, L'Art
romantique (Paris), p. 321 ("Victor Hugo").'"                                    [J4,8]

Baudelaire describes the poetry of the lyric poet-in the essay on Banville-in a
way that, point for point, brings into view the exact opposite of his own poetry:
"The word 'apotheosis' is one of those that unfailingly appear under the pen of
the poet when he has to describe . . . a mingling of glory and light. And if the lyric
poet has occasion to speak of himself, he will not depict himself bent over a
table, . . . wrestling with intractable phrases, . . . any more than he will show
himself in a pOOl; wretched, or disorderly room; nor, if he wishes to appear dead,
will he show himself rotting heneath a linen shroud in a wooden casket. That
would be lying;' Baudelaire, L'Art romantique (paris), pp. 370-371. 26         [J4a,2]

In his essay on Banville� Baudelaire mentions mythology together with allegory,
and then continues: " Mythology is a dictionary of living hieroglyphics." Baude­
laire� L 'Art romantiqu€ (Paris)� p. 370 . 27                             [J4a,3]

Conjunction of the modern and the demonic: "Modern poetry is related at oue
and the same time to painting, music, sculpture, decorative art, satiric philosophy,
and the analytic spirit. . . . Some could perhaps see in this symptoms of depravity
of taste. But that is a question which I do not wish to discuss here." Nevertheless,
a page later, after a reference to Beethoven, Maturin, Byron, and Poe, one reads:
"1 mean that modem art has an essentially demoniacal tendency. And it seems
that this satanic side of man . . . increases every day, as if the devil, like one who
fattens geese, enjoyed enlarging it by artificial means, patiently force-feeding the
human race in his poultry yard in order to prepare himself a more succulent
dish;' Baudelaire, L'Art romantique (paris) , pp. 373-374.28 The concept of the
demonic comes into play where the concept of modernity converges with
Catllolicism.                                                                    [J4a,4]

It is very important that the modern, with Baudelaire, appear not only as the
signature of an epoch but as an energy by which this epoch in1mediately trans­
forms and appropriates antiquity. Among all tlle relations into which modernity
enters, its relation to antiquity is critical. Thus, Baudelaire sees confirmed in
Hugo "the fatality which led him . . . partially to transform ancient ode and
ancient tragedy into the poems and dramas that we know." Baudelaire, L'Art
romantique (Paris), p. 401 (aLes Miserables '') :'' This is also, for Baudelaire, the
fimction of Wagner.                                                            [JS,!]

"Madame Bovary, in what is most forceful, most ambitious, and also most contem­
plative in her nature, has remained a man. Just as Pallas Athena sprang fully
armed from the head of Zeus, so this strange androgynous creature has kept all the
attraction of a virile soul in a charming feminine body." Further along, on
Flaubert: "!.All intellectual women will be grateful to him for having raised the
female to so high a level . . . and for having made her share in that combination of
calculation and reverie which constitutes the perfect being." Baudelaire, L 'Art

From '''Pierre Dupont": "By excluding morality, and often even passion, the puer­
ile Utopia of the school of art for art s sake was inevitably sterile . . . . When there
appeared a poet, awkward at times, hut almost always great, who proclaimed in
impassioned language the sacredness of the Revolution of 1830 and sang of the
destitution of England and Ireland, despite his defective rhymes, despite his pleo­
nasms, . . . the question was settled, and art was thereafter inseparahle from mo­
rality and utility."' Baudelaire, L 'Art romantique (Paris), p . 193 .:)6 The passage

Baudelaire in ��L'Art philosophique," an essay concerned mainly with Alfred Re­
thel; ��Here everything-place, decor, furnishings, accessories (see Hogarth, for
example)-everything is allegory, allusion, hieroglyph, rebus." Baudelaire, L 'Art
romantiqu,e, p. 131:10 There follows a reference to Michelet's interpretation of
Durer's Melancholia, I.                                                   [J5a,6]

Variant of the passage on Meryon cited by Geffroy, in ��Peintres et aqua-fortistes"
(1862): �I.Just the other day a young American artist, M. Whistler, was showing . . .
a set of etchings . . . representing the banks of the Thames; wonderful tangles of
rigging, yardarms and rope; farragos of fog, furnaces, and corkscrews of smoke;
the profound and intricate poetry of a vast capital. . . . M. Meryon, the true type
of the consummate etcher, could not neglect the call . . . . In the pungency, finesse,
and sureness of rus drawing, M. Meryon recalls all that was best in the old etchers.
We have rarely seen the natural solemnity of a great capital more poetically de­
picted. Those majestic accumulations of stone; those 'spires whose fingers point to
heaven ' ; those obelisks of industry, spewing forth their conglomerations of smoke
against the firmament; those prodigies of scaffolding 'round buildings under re­
pair, applying their openwork architecture, of such paradoxical and arachnean
beauty, upon architecture's solid hody; that foggy sky, charged with anger and
spite; those limitless perspectives, only increased by the thought of the dramas
they contain-he forgot not one of the complex elements which go to make up the
painful and glorious decor of civilization." Baudelaire, L 'Art romantiqlle (Paris),
pp. 119-121:'1                                                                  [J6,1]

On Guys: " Wherever those deep, impetuous desires, war, love, and gaming, are in

Baudelaire as antipode of Rousseau, in the maxim from his essay on Guys: "For
no sooner do we take leave of the domain of needs and necessities to enter that of
pleasures and luxury than we see that nature can counsel nothing but crime. It is
this infallible Mother Nature who has created parricide and cannibalism;' Baude­
laire, L'Art romantique (Paris), p. 100:'"                                  [J6,4]

Closing sentences of the Guys essay: �'He has gone everywhere in quest of the
ephemeral, the fleeting forms of beauty in the life of our day, the characteristic
traits of what, with the reader's permission, we have called "modernity. ' Often
bizarre, violent, excessive, but always full of poetry, he has succeeded, in his
drawings, in distilling the bitter or heady flavor of the wine of Life. ?? Baudelaire,

The figure of the "modem" and that of "allegory" must he brought into relation
with each other: "Woe unto him who seeks in antiquity anything other than pure
art, logic, and general method! By plunging too deeply into the past, . . . he
renounces the . . . privileges provided by circumstances; for almost all our origi­
nality comes from the stamp that time imprints upon our feelings <sensations>:'
Baudelaire, L'Art romantique (paris), p. 72 ("Le Peintre de la vie modeme")." But
the privilege ofwhich Baudelaire speaks also comes into force, in a mediated way,
vis-it-vis antiquity: the stamp of time that imprints itself on antiquity presses out
of it the allegorical configuration.                                           [J6a,2]


Concerning ��Spleen et ideal," these reflections from the Guys essay: "Modernity is
the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent; it is one half of art, the other half being
the eternal and immutable . . . . If any particular modernity is to be worthy of
becoming antiquity, one must extract from it the mysterious beauty that human
life involuntarily gives it. It is to this task that Monsieur G. particularly addresses
himself." Baudelaire, L iirt romantique (Paris), p. 70. In another place (p. 74), he
speaks of ��this legendary translation of external life. ",18                     [J6a,3]

G. is bending over his tahle, darting onto a sheet of paper the same glance that a
moment ago he was directing toward external things , skirmishing with his pencil,
his pen, his hrush, splashing his glass of water up to the ceiling, wiping his pen on
his shirt, in a ferment of violent activity, as though afraid that the images might
escape him, cantankerous though alone, elbowing himself on" (L'Art romantique,

something new:' Baudelaire, L'Art romantique (Paris), p. 62 ("Le Peintre de la vie

It would be important to determine Poe's relation to Latinity. Baudelaire's inter­
est in the technique of composition could have led him-in the end-as surely to
Latin culture as his interest in the artilicial led him to Anglo-Saxon culture.
Working through Poe, tlns latter area of culture also conditions-at tlle outset­
Baudelaire's theory of composition. Hence, it becomes more urgent to ask
whether tllls doctrine does not, in the end, bear a Latin stamp.             [J7,7J

Nature, according to Baudelaire, knows tllls one luxury: crime. Thus the sig­
nificance of the artificial. Perhaps we may draw on this thought for the interpreta­
tion of the idea that children stand nearest to original sin. Is it because, exuberant
by nature, they carmot get out of harm's way? At bottom, Baudelaire is tlllnking
of parricide. (Compare DArt romantique [Paris], p. 100.)55                      [J7a,lJ


The key to the emancipation from antiquity-which (see in the Guys essay, DArt

Baudelaire's manner of reciting. He gathered his friends-Antonio Watdpon,
Gabriel Dantrague, Malassis, Delvau-" in a modest cafe on the Rue Dau­

toward benevolence . . . , he would recite to us in a voice at once mincing, soft,
fiuty, oily, and yet mordant, some enormity or other-" Le Yin de l'assassin" <The
Murderer's Wine> or " Une Charogne" <Carrion>. The contrast between the vio­
lence of the images and the perfect placidity, the suave and emphatic accentuation,
of the delivery was truly striking." Jules Levallois, Milieu de siecle: Mfmwires d 'un

Highly significant letter from Baudelaire to Toussenel: "Monday, January 21,
1856. My dear Toussenel, I really want to thank you for your gift. 1 didn't know
the value of your book-I admit it simply and baldly. . . . For a long time I've been
rejecting almost all books with a feeling of disgust. les been a long time, too, since
I've t'ead anything so absolutely instructive and amusing. The chapter on the
falcon and the birds that hunt on man's behalf is a masterpiece in itself. / There
are expressions in your book that recall those of the great masters and which are
cries of truth-expressions whose tone is irresistibly philosophical, such as,
'Every animal is a sphinx/ and, with regard to analogy, 'What repose the mind
finds in gentle quietude, sheltered by so fertile and so simple a doctrine, for which
none of God's works is a mystery! ' . . . What is beyond doubt is that you are a
poet. I've been saying for a very long time that the poet is supremely intelligent . . .
and that imagination is the most scientijic of faculties, for it alone can understand
the universal analogy, or what a mystic religion calls correspondence. But when I
try to publish such statements, I'm told I'm mad . . . . What is absolutely certain is
that I have a philosophical cast of mind that allows me to see clearly what is true,
even in zoology, although I'm neither a huntsman nor a naturalist. . . . One idea
has been uppermost in my thoughts since I started reading your book-and this is
that you're a true intelligence which has wandered into a sect. All things consid­
ered, what do you owe to Fourier? Nothing, or very little. Without Fourier you
would still be what you are. Rational men didn't await Fourier's arrival on earth
to realize that nature is a language, an allegory, a mold, an embossing, if you
like . . . . Your book arouses in me a great many dormant thoughts-and where
original sin is concerned, as well as . . . fonH molded on an idea, I've often thought
that noxious, disgusting animals were, perhaps, merely the coming to life in hodily
form of man's evil thoughts . . . . Thus, the whole of natltre participates in oribrinal
sin. / Don't hold my boldness and straightforwardness against me, hut believe

'''Origin of the name Baudelaire. Here is what M. Georges Barral has written on
this subject in the La Revue des curiosites revolutionnaires: Baudelaire explained
the etymology of his name, which, he said, came not from bel or beau. hut from
band or bald. "My name is something terrible,' he declared. 'As a matter of fact,
the badelaire was a sahel' with a short, broad blade and a convex cutting edge,
hooked at the tip . . . . It was introduced into France after the Crusades and used
in Paris until around 1560 for executing criminals . Some years ago, in 1861, dur­
ing excavations carried out near the Pont-au-Change, they recovered the bade­
laire used by the executioner at the Grand Chat.elet in the twelfth century. It was
deposited in the Musee de Cluny. Go and have a look. It is frightening to see. I

Laforgue on Baudelaire: (."After all the liherties of Romanticism, he was the first to
discover these crude comparisons which suddenly, in the midst of a harmonious
period, cause him to put his foot in his plate; palpahle, exaggerated comparisons
which seem at times downright Ameriean; disconcerting purplish flash and dazzle:
"Night was thickening . . . like a part.ition!' (Other examples abound.) <Her walk is
like> a serpent at the end of a stick; her hair is an ocean; her head sways with the

Two stanzas by Baudelaire, found on the page of an album:
Noble strong-armed woman, who sleep and dream
throughout long days with no thought of good or evil,
who wear robes proudly slung in Grecian style;
you whom for many years (which seem slow to me now)
my lips, well versed in luscious kisses,
cherished with all the devotion of a monk;
priestess of debauch, my sister in lust,
who disdained to carry and nourish
a male child in your hallowed urn,
hut fear and flee the appalling stigmata
which virtue carved with its degrading blade
in pregnant matrons' flanks.67

"He was thefirst to write about himself in a moderate confessional manner, and to

the chimney corner, and the cats, beds, stockings, drunkards, and modern per­

"Two writers profoundly influenced Baudelaire, or rather two books . . . . One is
the delicious Diable amoureux, by Cazotte; the other, Dideroes La Religieuse. To
the first, many of the poems owe their restless frenzy . . . ; with Diderot, Baude­
laire gathers the somber violets of Lesbos." At this point, in a note, a citation from
Apollinaire's commentary to his edition of Baudelaire's Oeuvres poetiques: �'One
would probably not go wrong in taking Cazotte as the hyphen that had the
honor of uniting, in . . . Baudelaire, the spirit of the Revolution's writers with that

The "Choix de maximes consolantes sur I' amour" <Selected Consolatory Maxims
on Love> contains an excursus on ugliness (first published March 3, 1846, in Le
Corsaire-Satan). The beloved has contracted smallpox and suffered scars, which
from then on are the lover's delight: "You run a grave risk, if your pockmarked
mistress betrays you, of being able to console yourself only with pockmarked
women. For certain spirits, more precious and more jaded, delight in ugliness
proceeds from an obscurer sentiment still-the thirst for the unknown and the
taste for the horrible. It is this sentiment . . . which drives certain poets into the
dissecting room or the clinie, and women to public executions. I am sincerely sorry
for the man who cannot understand this-he is a harp who laeks a hass string!"

In considering the aggressive Catholicism displayed in Baudelaire's later work,
one must bear in mind that his writing had met with scant success during his
lifetime. This could have led Baudelaire, in rather unusual fashion, to align
himself or rather to identify himself with the completed works. His particular
sensuality found its theoretical equivalents only in the process of poetic composi­
tion; these equivalents, however, the poet appropriated to himself as such, uncon­
ditionally and without any sort of revision. They bear the trace of this origin
precisely in their aggressiveness.                                           [Jlla,l]

�'He has on a blood-red cravat and rose gloves. Yes, it is 1840.     Some years,
even green gloves were worn. Color disappeared from outfits only reluetantly. For
Baudelaire was not alone in sporting that purple or brick-colored cravat. Not
alone in wearing pink gloves. His trademark is in the combination of the two
effects with the black outfit." Eugene Marsan, Les Cannes de M. Paul Bourget et le

'''His utterances, Gautier thought, were full of 'capital letters and italics. ' He
appeared . . . surprised at what he himself said, as if he heard in his own voice t.he
words of a stranger. But it must be admitted that his women and his sky, his
perfumes, his nostalgia, his Christianity and his demon, his oceans and his trop­
ics, made for a suh,iect matter of stunning novelty. . . . I do not even criticize his
jerky gait, . . . which made people compare him to a spider. It was the beginning of'
that angular gesticulation which, little hy little, would displace the rounded graces
of the old world. Here, too, he is a precursor." Eugene Marsan, Les Cannes de

��Baudelaire is as incapahle of love as of labor. He loves as he writes, by fits and
starts, and then relapses into the dissolute egoism of a fla.neur. Never does he show
the slightest curiosity about human affairs or the slightest consciousness of human
evolution . . . . His art could therefore be said . . . to sin by reason of its narrow­
ness and singularity; these, indeed, are defects which put off sane and upright
minds such as love clear works of universal import." Georges Rency, Physiono­

"Like many another author of his day, he was not a writer but a stylist. His images
are almost always inappropriate. He will say of a look that it is 'gimlet-sharp. ' . . .
He will call repentance 'the last hostelry. ' . . . Baudelaire is a still worse writer in
prose than in verse . . . . He does not even know grammar. 'No French writer,' he
says, 'ardent for the glory of the nation, can, without pride and without regrets,
divert his gaze . . . ' The solecism here is not only flagrant; it is foolish. �' Edmond

Brunetiere recognizes, with Gautier, that Baudelaire has opened new territory for
poetry. Among the criticisms registered against him by the literary historian is
this: "Moreover, he was a poet who lacked more than one element of his art-nota­
bly (according to people who knew him) the gift of thinking directly in verse."

Brunetiere (L 'Evolution de Ia poesi,e lyrique en France au XIX" siecle, vol. 2
[Paris, 1894]) distinguishes Baudelaire on one side from the school of E-usldn, and
on the other from the Russian novelists. In both these movements he sees currents
which ? with good reason, resist the decadence proclaimed by Baudelaire, opposing
to everything hypercultivated the primitive simplicity and innocence of natural
man. A synthesis of these antithetical tendencies would he represented by Wag-
o

Baudelaire on Hugo: "Not only does he express precisely and translate literally
what is dearly and distinctly visible, but he expresses with indispensable obscu­
rity what is obscure and vaguely revealed!' Citing this sentence in Baudelaire,
l'homme et Ie poete (Paris), p. 22, Chatelain rightly says that Baudelaire is perhaps
the only man of his time to have understood the "secret Mallarmeism" of Hugo.

Larchey is an eyewitness to Baudelaire's first visit to an Academician-a call paid
to Jules Sandeau. Larchey finds himself in the entrance hall soon after Baudelaire.

Baudelaire's predilection for Jnvenal may well have to do with the latter's being
one of the first urban poets. Compare this observation by Tbibaudet: "In survey-
ing the great epochs of urban life, we see that the more the city provides poets
and other people with their intellectual and moral life, the more forcefully poetry
is pushed outside the city. When, . . . in the Greek world, that life was fostered
within the great cosmopolitan centers of Alexandria and Syracuse, these cities
gave birth to pastoral poetry. When the Rome of Augustus came to occupy a
similar position of centrality, the same poetry of shepherds, . . . of pristine nature,
appeared with the Bucolics and the Georgies of Virgil. And in eighteenth-century
France, at the most brilliant moment . . . of Parisian existence, the pastoral re�
appears as part of a return to antiquity. . . . The only poet in whom one might
find a foretaste of Baudelairean urbanism (and of other things Baudelairean as
well) would be perhaps, at certain moments, Saint-Amant." Albert Thibaudet,
Interieurs (Paris <1924,), pp. 7-9.                                            [J13a,3]

"'In passing from all these Romantic poets to Baudelaire, we pass from a landscape
of nature to a landscape of stone and flesh. . . . A religious awe of nature, which,
for these . . . Romantics, was part of their familiarity with nature, has become
with Baudelaire a hatred of nature. " [?]                                    [J13a,4]

Baudelaire on MusseL: "Except at the age of one'8 first Communion-in other
words, at the age when everything having to do with prostitutes and silk stockings
produces a religious effect-I have never been able to endure that paragon of
lady-killers l his spoiled-child's impudence, invoking heaven and hell in tales of
dinner-table conversations, his muddy torrent of mistakes in grammar and pros­
ody, and finally his utter incapacity to understand the process by which a reverie
becomes a work of art. "75 Thibaudet, who quotes this remark in Interieurs (p. 15),
juxtaposes it with one by Brunetiere on Baudelaire: "He's just a Satan with a
furnished apartment, a Beelzehuh of the dinner table" (p. 16).             [J13a,5]

" A sonnet like (.A Vne Passante' (To a Woman Passing By>, a stanza like the last
stanza of that sonnet1(' . . . could blossom only in the milieu of a great capital,

Tbibaudet adverts very apdy to the connection between confession and mys·
tification in Baudelaire. Through the latter, Baudelaire's pride compensates itself
for the fonner. "Ever since Rousseau's Corifessions) it seems that all our literature
of the personal has taken its departure from the broken·dowu furniture of relig­
ion, from a debunked confessional:' Tbibaudet, Inlfrieurs (paris) , p. 47 ("Baude­

"He worked, not always consciously, at that misunderstanding which isolated him
in his own time; he worked at it all the more as this misunderstanding was already
taking shape in himself. His private notes, published posthumously, are painfully
revealing in this respect. . . . As soon as this artist of incomparable subtlety speaks

(,�It is all a harmony of artifices, of deliberate contradictions. Let us try to note
some of these. Realism and idealism are mingled. Along with description that takes
extravagant pleasure in the most dismal details of physical reality there is, at the
same time, refined expression of ideas and beliefs that exceed the immediate im­
pression made on us by bodies-There is a union of the most profOlmd sensuality
with Christian asceticism. ('A horror of life, and an ecstatic joy in life,' writes
Baudelaire somewhere. B'I  •   • There is also, speaking of love, the combination of
•



adoration and contempt for woman . . . . Woman is seen as a slave, as an ani­
mal, . . . yet to her the same homage, the same prayers are addressed as to the
immaculate Virgin. Or rathel', she is seen as the universal trap . . . and worshipped
for her deadly power. And that is not all: even as one seeks to render the most
ardent passion, one also labors to find for it . . . the most lmexpected form . . . -
that is, what bespeaks the greatest sang-froid and even absence of passion . . . .
One believes, or one pretends to believe, in the devil; he is envisaged by turns, or
simultaneously, as the Father of Evil and as the great Loser and great Victim; and
one delights in proclaiming one's impiety in the language of . . . the faithful. 'Pro­
gress' is cursed; the industrial civilization of the century is execrated, . . . and, at
the same time, the poet revels in the special color and brilliancy this civilization
has brought to human life . . . . Such, I believe, is the basic intent of Baudelairism:
always to unite two opposed orders of feeling . . . and, at bottom, two divergent
conceptions of the world and of life-the Christian and the other, or, if you like,
the past and the present. It is a masterpiece of the Will (like Baudelaire, I capital­

" Three different men inhabit this man at one and the same time . . . . These three
men are all quite modern, and more modern still is their synthesis. The crisis of
religious faith, the city life of Paris, and the scientific spirit of the age . . . are so
thoroughly allied here as to appear inseparable . . . . Faith has died out, whereas
mysticism, though intellectually discredited, still permeates the sensibility. . . . We
could note . . . the use of liturgical terminology to celebrate sensual pleasure . . . or
that curious work of 'prose' in decadent Latin style which he entitled 'Franciscae
meae laudes.' . . . On the other hand, his lihertine tastes came from Paris. Every-
where in his . . . poems is a backdrop of Parisian vice, as well as a backdrop of
Catholic ritual. He has obviously penetrated-and with hair-raising experiences,
we may be sure-the most wretched strata of this unchaste city. He has eaten at
common dinner tables beside painted women whose mouths drip blood through
masks of ceruse. He has slept in brothels, and has known the rancor of broad
daylight illuminating, along with the faded curtains , the still more faded face of the
woman-for-hire. He has sought out . . . the unthinking spasm that . . . cures the
mal de pense,.. And, at the same time, he has stopped and chatted at every street­
corner in town. . . . He has led the life of the literary man, . . . and he has . . .

sordid swamp of mine affords / the mystic nourislnnent on which they thrive [qui

les aime, augmente ses verdures] . . . : Like those who feel themselves completely
in command of what they waut to say, he seeks at first the most remote of terms;
he then invites their approach, conciliates them, and infuses them with a quality
you would not have thought could be theirs . . . . Such poetry cannot be the
product of inspiration. . . . And just as the unfolding thought . . . slowly breaks
free of the obscurity in which it began, so the poetic trajectory retains a certain
slowness from its long virtuality: 'How sweet the greenish light of your elongated
eyes: . . . Every one of Baudelaire's poems is a movement. . . . Each constitutes
some particular phrase, question, reminder, invocation, or dedication, which has
a specific direction:' Jacques Riviere, Etudes (Paris), pp. 14-18."'        [J16,2]

Construction of "'L'Echec de Baudelaire" <Baudelaire's defeat}, by Rene l.a­
forgue. As a child, Baudelaire is supposed to have witnessed the coitus of his nurse
or his mother ·with her (first or second?) husband; he would find himself in the
position of third person in a love relationship and would settle down in that posi­
tion; he would become a voyeur and frequent bordellos mainly as a voyeur; owing
to this same fixation on the visual, he would hecome a critic and experience a need
for ohjectivity, ""so that nothing is "lost to view. m .He would helong to a clearly
defined category of patients: ""For them, to see means to soar above everything,
like eagles, in complete security, and to realize a sort of omnipotenee by identifica­
tion at once with the man and with the woman . . . . These are the people who then
develop t.hat fatal taste for the ahsolute . . . , and who, taking refuge in the domain
of pure imagination, lose the use of their hearts" (L 'Echec de Baudelaire [Paris,
1931], pp. 201, 204).9<)                                                    [J17,4]

""Baudelaire loved Aupick without being aware of it, and . . his reason for con­
tinually provoking his stepfather was in order to be loved by him. . . . If .Teanne
Duval played a part in the poet's emotional life analogous to that played by
Aupick, we can understand why Baudelaire was . . . sexually possessed by her.
And so . . . this union stood, rather, for a homosexual union, in which Baudelaire
chielly played the passive role-that of the woman." Rene Laforgue, L 'Echec de
Baadelaire (Paris, 1931), pp. 175, 177."'                                     [J17,5]

On the compulsion to lie, as seen in Baudelaire: '''The direct and spontaneous
expression of a truth becomes, for these subtle and tormented consciences, the
equivalent of success . . . in incest; success, that is to say, in a sphere in which it
can be realized simply by "good sense.' . . . For in those cases where normal sexu­
ality is repressed, good sense is fated to lack an object." Rene Laforgue, L 'Echec

"The most wretched woman encountered at night in the shadows of a disreputahle
alley takes on, in his mind, a tragic grandeur: seven demons are in them [ ! ] and the
whole mystical sky looks down on this sinner whose soul is in peril. He tells himself
that the vilest kisses resound through all eternity, and he hrings to hear on this
momentary encounter eighteen centuries of devilishness" (p. 22). " He is attracted
to women only to the point necessary for irrevocable loss of his soul. He is never a
lover, and he would not even be a debauchee if debauchery were not superlatively
impious . . . . He would have nothing to do with women if he were not hoping
that, through them, he could offend God and make the angels weep" (p. 22).

'''At hottom, he had but half a faith. Only his spirit was completely Christian. His
heart and intelled remained empty. There is a story that one day a naval officer,

monstrous little head carved from a piece of wood by a poor hlack man.-'It is
awfully ugly,' says the officer, and he threw it away disdainfully.-'Take care,'

"The hypothesis of Baudelaire s P. G. <paralyse generale> has persisted for half a
century and still reigns in certain quarters. Nevertheless� it is based on a gross and
demonstrable error and is without any foundation in fact. . . . Baudelaire did not
die from P. G. but from softening of the brain� the consequence of a stroke . . . and
of a hardening of the cerebral arteries." Louis-Antoine-Justine Caubert� La
NflVrose de Baudelaire (Bordeaux, 1930), pp. 42-43. The argument against gen­
eral paralysis is made, likewise in a treatise� by Raymond Trial, La Maladie de
Baudelaire (Paris, 1926)� p. 69. But he sees the brain disorder as a consequence of
syphilis, whereas Caubert believes that syphilis has not been conclusively estab­
lished in Baudelaire's case (see p. 46); he cites Remond and Voivenel, Le Genie
litteraire (Paris, 1912)� p. 41: ��Baudelaire was . . the victim of sclerosis of the

Indicative of the reputation that preceded Baudelaire before he had published
anything of importance is this remark by Gautier: "I fear that with Baudelaire it
will be as it once was with Petrus Borel. In our younger days� we used to say: Hugo
has only to sit and wait; as soon as Petrus publishes something, he will disap­
pear. . . . Today, the name of Baudelaire is brandished before us; we are told that
when he publishes his poems, Musset, Laprade, and I will dissolve into thin air. 1

" As a writer, Baudelaire had one great defect, of which he had no inkling: he was
ignorant. What he knew, he knew well; but he knew very little. History, physiol­

terested him; he saw it perhaps, but assuredly he never studied it." Maxime Du

'"In the drawing room on t.he Place Royale, Baudelaire had himself introduced as
a fervent disciple but . . . Hugo, ordinarily so skillful in sending away his visitors
happy, did not understand the artijicialiste character and the exclusively Parisian
predilections of the young man . . . . Their relations nonetheless remained cordial,
Hugo having evidently not read the 4Salon de 1846'; and, in his 4Refiexions sur

"In 1876, in an article entitled 'Chez feu mon maitrc' <At the Home of My Late
Mentor), Cladel would evoke . . . the macabre trait in the physiognomy of' the poet.
Never, according to this witness, . . . was he more forbidding than when he wanted
to appear jovial; his voice took on a disquieting edge, while his vis comica, made
one shudder. On the pretext of exorcizing the evil spirits of his auditors, and with
bursts of' laughter piercing as sobs, he told them outrageous tales of trysts beyond
the grave which froze the blood in their veins." Ernest Seilliere, Baudelaire

I had a fine park, planted with yews>,"'which Baudelaire apparently addressed to
a young lady of Lyons some time around 1839-1840, is reminiscent, in its closing
line-"And you know that too, my beauty, whose eyes are too shrewd"-of the
last line of "A Une Passante."                                            [J19,1]

The piece "Vocations;' in Spleen de Paris, is of great interest-particularly the
account of the third child, who "lowered his voice: 'It certainly gives you a funny
feeling not to be sleeping alone, and to be in bed with your nurse, and in the
dark. . . . If you ever get the chance, try to do the same-you'll see!' I While he
was talking, the eyes of the young author of this revelation had widened with a
sort of stupefaction at what he was still feeling, and the light of the setting sun
playing in his untidy red curls seemed to be lighting up a sulfurous aureole of
passion;' 97 The passage is as notable for Baudelaire's conception of the sinful as
for the aura of public coriffssio.                                           [J19,2]

started out by writing thousands of lines of fluent verse �on any and every subject, �

reined in this facility when . . . , at about the age of twenty-two, he began to write
the poems which he entitled first. Les Lesbiennes, then Les Limbes . . . . The Petits

From the obituary notice, "Charles Baudelaire;' byJules Valles, which appeared
September 7, 1867, in La Rue: "Will he have ten years of immortality?" (p. 190).
"These are, moreover, bad times for the biblicists of the sacristy or of the cabaret!
Ours is an age of gaiety and distrust, one that never long suspends the recital of
nightmares or the spectacle of ecstasies. It has now become clear that no one else
had enough foresight to undertake such a campaign at the period when Bande­
laire began his" (pp. 190-191). "Why didn't he become a professor of rhetoric or
a dealer in scapulars, this didactician who imitated the blasted and downtrodden,
this classicist who wanted to shock Prudhomme, but who, as Dusolier has said,
was only a hysterical Boileau who went to play Dante among the cafes" (p. 192).
Notwithstanding the resounding error in its appreciation of the importance of
Baudelaire's work, the obituary contains some perceptive passages, particularly
those concerned with the habitus ofBandelaire: "He had in him something of the
priest, the old lady, and the ham actor. Above all, the hanl actor" (p. 189). The

Baudelaire introduces into the lyric the figure of sexual perversion that seeks its

1.�'The unexampled ogle of a whore / glinting toward you like a silver ray / the
wavering moon releases on the lake';1 l9 so begins the last poem. And into this
extraordinary stare, which brings uncontrollable tears to the eyes of him who
meets it without defenses, Berg looked long and avidly. For him, however, as for
Baudelaire, the mercenary eye became a legacy of the prehistoric world. The
arc-light moon of the big city shines for him like something out of the age of
hetaerism. He needs only to have it reflected, as on a lake, and the banal reveals
itself as the distant past; the nineteenth-century commodity betrays its mythic
taboo. It was in such a spirit that Berg composed Lulu." Wiesengrund-Adorno,

"Le Crepuscule du matin" occupies a crucial position in Les Fleurs du mal. The
morning wind disperses the clouds of myth. Human beiogs and their affairs are

was probably composed after 1850.)                                      [J22,4]

The antithesis between allegory and myth has to be clearly developed. It was
owing to the genius of allegory that Baudelaire did not succumb to the abyss of
myth that gaped beneath his feet at every step.                         [J22,5]

The following argument-which dates from a period in which the decline of
sculpture had become apparent, evidently prior to the decline of painting-is
very instructive. Baudelaire makes exactly the same point about sculpture from
the perspective of painting as is made today about painting from the perspective
of film. "A picture, however, is only what it wants to be; there is no other way of
looking at it than on its own terms. Painting has but one point of view; it is
exclusive and absolute, and therefore the painter's expression is much 1110re
forceful." Baudelaire, Oeuvres, vol. 2, p. 128 ("Salon de 1846"}. Just before this
(pp. 127-128): "The spectator who moves around the figure can choose a hun­
dred different points of view, except the right one."'" <Compare>J4, 7.     [J22a,2J

ference between the solitude which the great artist of spleen chose for himself' in
Brussels in order "to gain an inalienable individual tranquillity � and the solitude of

individual in his difference. It is, rather� a participation in the (�osmie mystery� an

Baudelaire calls Hugo a "genius without borders. "m                          [J23 ,S]

It is presumably no accident that, in searching for a poem by Hugo to provide
with a pendant, Baudelaire fastened on one of the most banal of the banal-"Les
Fantomes:' h1 this sequence of six poems, the first begios : "How many maidens
fair, alas! I've seen I Fade and die." The third: "One form above all,-'twas a
Spanish maid:' And further on: "What caused her death? Balls, dances-daz­
zling balls; I They filled her soul with ecstasy and joi' This is followed by the
story of how she caught cold one morning, and eventually sank into the grave.
The sixth poem resembles the close of a popu1ar ballad: "0 maidens, whom such
festivefiites decay! I Ponder the story of this Spanish maid."'"           [J23, 6]

WIth Baudelaire's "La Valli" <The Voice> compare Victor Hugo's '�Ce qu'on
entend sur la montagne" <What Is Heard on the Mountain>. The poet gives ear
to the world storm:
Soon with that voice confusedly combined,
Two other voices, vague and veiled, I find.

And seemed each voice, though mixed, distinct to be,
As two cross-currents 'neath a streanl you see.

One from the seas-triumphant, blissful song!
Voice of the waves, which talked themselves among;
The other, which from the earth to heaven ran,
Was full of sorrow-the complaint of man.

TI,e poem tal,es, as its object, the dissonance of the second voice, which is set off
against the harmony of the first. Ending:
Why God . . .
Joins in the fatal hymn since earth began,
The song of Nature, and the cries of man?125                      [J23,7]

he would have been able to write in this manner on human nature and to insult it

poetic, a language hewn and shaped like hronze and stone, in which eaeh phrase

·. . what would become of poetry in passing through a head organized, for exam­
ple, like that of Caligula or Heliogabalus" (p. 376).-"Thus, like the old Goethe
who transformed himself into a seller of Turkish pastilles in his Divnn . . . , the
author of Les Fleurs du mnl turned villainous, blasphemous, impious for the sake
of his thought" (pp. 375-376). <Jules> Barbey cl'Aurevilly, XIX Siecle: Les Oeu­

"(,A critic (M. Thierry, in Le Moniteur) made the point recently in a very fine

At the age of eleven, Baudelaire experienced first hand the workers' rebellion of

The sense of "the abyssal" is to be defined as "meaning!' Such a sense is always
allegorical.                                                                 [J24,1]

With Blanqui, the cosmos has become an abyss. Baudelaire's abyss is starless; it
should not be defined as cosmic space. But even less is it the exotic space of
theology. It is a secularized space: the abyss of knowledge and of meanings.
What constitutes its historical index? In Blanqui, the abyss has the historical
index of mechanistic natural science. In Baudelaire, doesn't it have the social
index of nouveau!i? Is not the arbitrariness of allegory a twin to that of fashion?
[J24,2]
Explore the question whether a connection exists between the works of the
allegorical imagination and the correspondances. In any case, these are two wholly
distinct sources for Baudelaire's production. That the first of them has a very
considerable share in the specific qualities of Iris poetry Gumot be doubted. The
nexus of meanings might be akin to that of the fibers of spun yarn. If we can
distinguish between spinning and weaving activity in poets, then the allegorical
imagination must be classed with the forrner.-On the other hand, it is not
impossible that the correspondences play at least some role here, insofar as a
word, in its way, calls forth an image; thus, the image could determine the
meaning of the word, or else the word that of the image.                        [J24,3]

The famous statement by Valery on Baudelaire <see ]1, h goes back, in essence,
to the suggestions Sainte-Beuve sent to Baudelaire for his courtroom defense. "In
the field of poetry, everything was taken. Lamartine had taken the skies. Victor
Hugo, the earth-and more than the earth. Laprade, the forests. Musset, the
dazzling life of passion and orgy. Others, the hearth, rural life, and so on. Theo­
phile Gautier, Spain and its vibrant colors. What then remained? What Baude­

Very plausible indication in Porche to the effect that Baudelaire did not produce
the many decisive variants to his poems while seated at his desk. (See POl'eM,

working, thinking, composing . . . . For my part, I saw him composing verses on
the run while he was out in the streets; I never saw him seated before a ream of
paper." Cited in Secbe, La Vie des Fleurs du mal (1928), p. 84.            [J25,6]

The way Baudelaire presented himself during his Brussels lecture on Gautier, as
described by Camille Lemonnier in La Vie beige: "'Baudelaire made one think of a
man of the church, with those beautiful gestures of the pulpit. His soft linen cuffs
fluttered like the sleeves of a clerical frock. He developed his subject with an
�
almost evangelical unctuousness, proclaiming his veneration for a literary master
in the liturgical tones of a bishop announcing a mandate. To himself, no doubt, he
was celebrating a Mass full of glorious images; he had the grave beauty of a cardi­
nal of letters officiating at the altar of the Ideal. His smooth, pale visage was
shaded in the halftone of the lamplight. I watched his eyes move like black suns.
His mouth had a life of its own within the life and expressions of his face; it was
thin and quivering with a delicate vibrancy tmder the drawn bow of his words.
And from its haughty height the head commanded the attention of the intimidated
audience." Cited in Socho, La Vie des Fleurs du mal (1928), p . 68.         [J25,7]

Gautier: r.'Baudelaire loves ample polysyllabic words, and with three or four of

resonate in such a way as to lengthen the meter." Cited in A. Seche, La Vie des

E. Faguet in an article in La Revue: "Since 1857, the neurasthenia among us has

Le Figaro publishes (date?) an article by Gustave Bourdin that was written at the
instigation of Interior Minister Billaut. The latter had shortly before, as judge or
public prosecutor, suffered a setback with the acquittal of Flaubert in the trial
against Madame Bovary. A few days later came Thierry's article in Le Moniteur.
'"Why did Sainte-Benve . . . leave it to Thierry to tell readers of Le Moniteur about
Les Fleurs du mal? Sainte-Beuve doubtless refused to write about Baudelaire's
book because he deemed it more prudent to efface the ill effect his article on
Madame Bovary had had in the inner circles of the government." Alphonse Seche,
La Vie des Fleurs du mal (1928), pp. 156-157. 1'7                             [J25a,5]

The denunciation in Bourdin's article is treacherously disguised as praise for
precisely those poems singled out in the indictment. Nter a disgusted enumera­
tion of Baudelaire's topics, he writes: ''And in the middle of it all, four poems-oLe
Reniement de Saint Pierre; then 'Lesbos; and two entitled 'Fenunes danmees'­
four masterpieces ofpassion, of art, and of poetry. It is understandable that a poet
of twenty might be led by his imagination to treat these subjects, but nothing
excuses a man over thirty who foists such monstrosities on the public by means
of a book:' Cited in Alphonse SecliC, La Vie deJ Fleu," du mal (1928), p. 158.

From Edouard Thierry �8 review of Les Fleurs du mal in Le Moniteur (July 14,
1857?): �r.The Florentine of old would surely recognize, in this French poet of
today, the characteristic ardor, the terrifying utterance, the ruthless imagery, and
the sonority of his brazen lines . . . . I leave his book and his talent under Dante's
stern warning." 128 Cited in Alphonse Seche, Le Vie des Fleurs du mal (1928),

Baudelaire's great dissatisfaction with the frontispiece designed by Bracquemond
according to specifications provided by the poe� who had conceived this idea
while perusing Hyacinthe Langlois' Histoire deJ danseJ macabreJ. Baudelaire's
instructions : "A skeleton turning into a tree, with legs and ribs forming the trunk,
the arms stretched out to make a cross and bursting into leaves and buds, shelter·
ing several rows of poisonous plants in little pots, lined up as if in a gardener's
hothouse:' <SeeJ16,3.> Bracquemond evidently runs into difficulties, and more·
over misses the poet's intention when he masks the skeleton's pelvis with flowers
and fails to give its arms the form of branches. From what Baudelaire has said,
the artist simply does not know what a Jque/ette arboreJcent is supposed to be, and
he can't conceive how vices are supposed to be represented as flowers. (Cited in
Alphonse Seche, La Vie deJ FleurJ du mal [<Amiens,> 1928], pp. 136-137, as
drawn from letters.) In the end, a portrait of the poet by Bracquemond was
substituted for this planned image. Something similar resurfaced around 1862, as
Poulet·Malassis was planning a luxury edition of LeJ FleurJ du mal. He commis·
sioned Bracquemond to do the graphic design, which apparently consisted of
decorative borders and vignettes; emblematic devices played a major role On
these. (See Seche, p. 138.)-The subject that Bracquemond had failed to render
was taken up by Rops in the frontispiece to LeJ EpaveJ (1866).                [J26,2]

To the right of the barricade; to the left of the barricade. It is very significant that,
for large portions of the middle classes, there was only a shade of difference
between these two positions. This changes only with Louis Napoleon. For
Baudelaire it was possible (no easy trick!) to be friends with Pierre Dupont and to
participate in the June Insurrection on the side of the proletariat, while avoiding
any sort of run-in when he encountered his friends from the Ecole NOffilande,
Chennevieres and Le Vavasseur, in the company of a national guardsman.-It
may be recalled, in this context, that the appointment of General Aupick as
ambassador to Constantinople in 1848 goes back to Lamartine, who at that tin,e
was minister of foreign affairs.                                                [J26a,6]

Seilliere represents as his particular object of study what in general determines
the standard for the literature on Baudelarre: "It is, in effect, the theoretical
conclusions imposed on Charles Baudelarre by his life experiences that I am
particularly concerned with in these pages." Ernest Seilliere, Baudelaire (paris,
1931), p. 1.                                                                [J27,8]

Seilliere (p. 59) righdy contrasts Baudelarre's postulate, according to which the
advent of Napoleon III is to be interpreted in de Maistre's sense as "providen·

Another Bonaparte! What a disgrace!" Both in "Mon Coeur mis it nu:"'';

The book by Seilliere is dlOrougbly imbued with the position of its author, who is
president of the Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques. A typical premise:
"The social question is a question of morality" (p. 66). Individual sentences by
Baudelaire are invariably accompanied by the author's marginal glosses.

'''Note that this innovator has not a single new idea. Mter Vigny, one must wait

set of a young man of good family. -Very instmctive in this regard: "In every
change there is something at once vile and agteeable, some element of disloyalty
and restlessness. This sufficiently explains the French Revolution;"3" The senti­

The hypothesis that Baudelaire, in 1848, helped to found the conservative news­
paper Le Representant de ['Indre (later edited by Pomoy) comes from ReneJohan­
net. The newspaper supported the candidacy of Cavaignac. Baudelaire's

mystification. Without his knowledge, his trip to Chiiteauroux was subsidized,

name goes unmentioned. Decisive for Baudelaire, according to Asselineau, was
the translation of "The Black Cat" by Isabelle Meunier, in La Democratie pacifique
(1847). Characteristically enough, the first of Baudelaire's translations from Poe,

From Gautier's obituary for Baudelaire, Le MoniteUl� September 9, 1867: ��Born
in India, and possessing a thorough knowledge of the English language, he made
his debut with his translations of Edgar Poe. " Theophile Gautier, Portraits con­
temporains (Paris, 1874), p. 159.                                        [J29a,2]

A good half of Gautier's obituary notice is occupied with Poe. The part devoted to
Les Fleurs du mal depends 011 metaphors which Gautier extracts from a story by
Hawthorne: ��We never read Les Flew"s du mal, by Baudelaire, without thinking
involuntarily of that tale by Hawthorne <entitled �r.Rappaccini's Daughter">; it has
those somber and metallic colors, those verdigris blossoms and heady perfumes.
His muse resembles the doctor's daughter whom no poison can harm, but whose
pallid and anemic complexion betrays the influence of the milieu she inhabits."
Theophile Gautier, Portraits contemporains (Paris ? 1874), p . 163. <See J3a,2.>
[J29a,3]

Gautier's characterization of Baudelaire, in his Histoire du Romantisme, is not
much more than a succession of questionable metaphors. "This poet's talent for
concentration has caused him to reduce each piece to a single drop of essence
enclosed in a crystal flagon cut with many facets;' and so on (p. 350). Banality
pervades the entire analysis. "Although he loves Paris as Balzac loved it; al­
though, in his search for rhymes, he wanders through its most sinister and
mysterious lanes at the hour when the reflections of the lights change the pools of
rainwater into pools of blood, and when the moon moves along the broken
outline of the dark roofs like an old yellow ivory skull; although he stops at times
by the smoke-dimmed windows of taverns, listening to the croaking song of the
drunkard and the strident laugh of the prostitute, . . . yet very often a suddenly
recurring thought takes him back to India:' Theophile Gautier, Histoire du Ro­
mantisme (Paris, 1874), p. 379 ("Le Progres de la poesie fran�aise depuis 1830'').''''

The fortune Baudelaire inherited in 184,2 totaled 75,000 francs (in 1926, equiva­

Porche (p. 98) draws attention to the fact that, with Saliz� Ancelle, and Aupick,
Baudelaire had relations of a typical sort.                               [J30,1l]

Consider that Baudelaire not infrequently, it appears, loved to humble himself in
long conversations with Ancelle. In this, too, he is afils de fomille. More along
these lines in his farewell letter: "1 shall probably have to live a very hard life, but
I shall be better off that way:',,5                                             [J30,131

Indicative of a perhaps not uncommon tone in the exchanges between the two
writers is Champfieury's letter of March 6, 1863. Baudelaire, in a letter now lost,
had declined Champfieury's proposal to meet a female admirer of the Le Fleurs
du mal and the writings of Poe, making a point of his dignity. Champfieury
responds: "As for my compromised dignity, 1 refuse to hear of it. Stop frequenting
places of far worse repute. Try to imitate my life of hard work; be as independent
as I am; never have to depend on others-and then you can talk about dignity. /
The word, in fact, means nothing to me, and I put it down to your peculiar ways,
which are both affected and natural" (cited in E. and J. Crepet, < Charles Baude­
laire [paris, 1906],> appendix, p. 341). Baudelaire (Lettres, pp. 349ff.) writes back
on the same day.'''                                                             [J30a,21

Ange I\cchmeja, Bucharest, February 11-23, 1866. In this long letter full of great
admiration, an exact outlook on la poesie pure: "I would say something more: I

translated by the geometric forms and subtle colors which belong to them by
analogy, they would possess the agreeable texture and beautiful tints of a Persian

From Schaunard, Souvenirs (Paris, 1887): '''I detest the countryside,' says
Baudelaire in explanation of his hasty departure from Honfleur, 'particularly in
good weather. The persistent sunshine oppresses me . . . . Ah! speak to me of those
everchanging Parisian skies that laugh or cry according to the wind, and that
never, in their variable heat and humidity, have any effect on the stupid crops . . . .
I am perhaps affronting your convictions as a landscape painter, but I must tell
you further that an open body of water is a monstrous thing to me; I want it
incarcerated, contained within the geometric walls of a quay. My favorite walking
pla{�e is the emhankment along the Canal de l'Ourcq'" (cited in Crepet, p. 160).
[J31,2]

Crepet juxtaposes Schaunard's report with the letter to Desnoyers, and then re­
marks in closing: "'What can we conclude from all this? Perhaps simply that
Baudelaire belonged to that family of unfortunates who desire only what they do
not have and love only the place where they are not" (Crepet, p. 161).   [J3 1,3]

Baudelaire's shtcerite was formerly much discussed. Traces of this debate are still
to be found in Crepet (see p. 172).                                        [J3 1 ,4]

i."The laughter of children is like the blossoming of a flower.    . It is a plant-like

hetween the laughter of children and such expressions of animal contentment, . . .

The incomparable force of Poe's description of the crowd. One thinks of early
lithographs by Senefelder, like "Der Spielclub" <The Players' Club>, "Die Menge
nach Einbmch der Dunkelheit" <The Crowd after Nightfall>: "The rays of the
gas lamps, feeble at first in their struggle with the dying day, had now at length
gained ascendancy, and threw over everything a fitful and garish luster. All was
dark yet splendid-as that ebony to which has been likened the style of Tertul­
lian." 152 Edgar Poe, Nouvelles HistDires extraordinaires, trans. Charles Baudelaire

Concerning the conception of the crowd in Victor Hugo, two very characteristic
passages from "La Pente de la reverie" <The Propensity for Reverie>:
Crowd without name! Chaos!-Voices, eyes, footsteps.
T hose never seen, those never known.
All the living!-cities buzzing in the ear
More than any beehive or American woods.
The following passage shows the crowd depicted by Hugo as though with the
burio of an engraver:
The night with its crowd, in this hideous dream,
Came on-growing denser and darker together­
And, in these regions which no gaze can fathom,
The increase of men meant the deepening of shadow.
All became vague and uncertain; only a breath
That from moment to moment would pass,
As though to grant me a view of the great anthill,
Opened in the far-reaching shadow some valleys of light,
As the wind that blows over the tossing waves
Whitens the foam, or furrows the wheat in the fields.

brandy?' someone will ask. What of it? You too drink, Mister Bourgeois, Mister
Grocer; you have as many vices as-and even more than-the poet. . . . Balzac

List of Baudelaire's topics, in Jaloux: "nervous irritability of the individual de­

dignity upon it through religion or through art . . . ; love of debauchery in order to
forget or punish oneself . . . ; passion for travel, for the unknown, for the

According to Charles Toubin, Baudelaire in 1847 had two domiciles, on the Rue de
Seine and the Rue de Babylone. On days when the rent was due, he often spent the
night with friends in a third. See Crepet, <Charles Baudelaire, (Paris, 1906),>
p. 48.                                                                    [J34,1]

Crepet (p. 47) counts fourteen addresses for Baudelaire between 1342 and 1353,
not including Honfleur and some temporary lodgings. He lived in the Quartier dn
Temple, the Ile Saint-Louis, the QuarticI' Saint-Germain, the Quartier Mont-
martre, the QUHrtier de la Republique.                                  [J34,2]

"You are passing through a great city that has grown old in civilization-one of
those cities which harbor the most important archives of universal life-and your
eyes are drawn upward, sursum) ad sidera; for in the public squares, at the corners
of the crossways, stand motionless figures, larger than those who pass at their
feet, repeating to you the solemn legends of Glory, War, Science, and Martyr­
dom, in a mute language. Some are pointing to the sky, whither they ceaselessly
aspired; others indicate the earth from which they sprang. They brandish, or
they contemplate, what was the passion of their life and what has become its
emblem: a tool, a sword, a book, a torch, vitai lampada! Be you the most heedless
of men, the most unhappy or the vilest, a beggar or a banker, the stone phantom
takes possession of you for a few minutes and commands you, in the name of the
past, to think of things which are not of the earth. / Such is the divine role of
sculpture." Ch. B.,  Oeuvres, ed. Le Dantec, vol, 2, pp. 274-275 ("Salon de
1859")."" Baudelaire speaks here of sculpture as though it were present only in
the big city. It is a sculpture that stands in the way of the passerby. This depiction
contains something in the highest degree prophetic, though sculpture plays only
the smallest part in that which would fulfill the prophecy. Sculpture is found <?>
only in the city.                                                                [J3 '1,3]

Baudelaire speaks of his partiality for "the landscape of romance;' more and
more avoided by painters. From his description, it becomes evident that he is
thinking of structures essentially Baroque: "But surely our landscape painters are
far too herbivorous in their diet? They never willingly take their nourislnnent
from ruins . . . . I feel a longing for . . . crenellated abbeys, reflected in gloomy
pools; for gigantic bridges, towering Ninevite constructions, haunts of dizzi­
ness-for everything, in short, which would have to be invented if it did not
already exist!" Ch. B., Oeuvres, ed. Le Dantec, vol. 2, p. 272 ("Salon de 1859"). '62

Beginnings, with Baudelaire, of a devious rationalization of the charms exerted
on him by prostitution: "Love may arise from a generous sentiment-namely, the
liking for prostitution; but it soon becomes corrupted by the liking for owner­
ship" ("Fusees" ) , �'The human heart's ineradicable love of prostitution-source

In his famous description of the lecture Baudelaire gave on Gautier in Brussels,
Camille Lemonnier represents in a fascinating way the mounting perplexity into
which the lecturer's positive glorification of Gautier plunged the audience. They
had got the impression, as the talk went on, that Baudelaire was going to turn
with some inimitable sarcasm from all he had said, as from a kind of decoy, in
order to develop a different conception of poetry. And this expectation paralyzed

The following sonnet from the body of work by Prarond is attributed by Mouquet
to Baudelaire:
Born in the mud to a nameless jade\
The child grew up speaking argot;
By the age often\ he had graduated from the sewers;
Grown, he would sell his sister-is a jack-of-all-trades.
His hack has the curve of an old flying buttress;
He can sniff out the way to every cheap bordello;
His look is a mixture of arrogance and cllllning;
He's the one to serve as watchdog for rioters.
Wax-coated string keeps his thin soles in place;
On his uncovered pallet a dirty wench laughs
To think of her husband deceived hy unchaste Paris,
Plebeian orator of the stockroom,
He talks politics with the corner grocer,
Here is what's called an el�f'ant de Paris.

political beauty, which is an expression of universal equality, hut also their poetic
beauty, which is an expression of the public soul-an endless procession of hired
mourners, political mourners, amorous mourners, bourgeois mourners. We are

"For when I hear men like Raphael and Veronese being lauded to the skies, with
the manifest intention of diminishing the merit of those who came after them, . . .
I ask myself if a merit which is at least the equal of theirs (I will even admit for a

more meritorious, since it has triumphantly evolved in an atmosphere and a
territory which are hostile to it;' Ch. B., Oeuvres, vol. 2, p. 239 ("Salon de

Baudelaire's attitude toward progress was not always the same. Certain declara­
tions in the "Salon de 1846" contrast clearly with remarks made later. In that
essay we find, among other things: "There are as many kinds of beauty as there
are habitual ways of seeking happiness. TIlls is clearly explained by the philoso­
phy of progress . . . . Romanticism will not consist in a perfect execution, but in a
conception analogous to the ethical disposition of the age" (p. 66). In the same
text: "Delacroix is the latest expression of progress in art" (p. 85). Ch. B.,

o
o    The importance of theory for artistic creation was not something about which
eo
Bandelaire was clear, initially. In the "Salon de 1845;' discussing the painter
Haussoullier, he asks: "Is M. Haussoullier perhaps one of those who know too
much about their art? That is a truly dangerous scourge:' Ch. B., Oeuvres, vol. 2,
p. 23 . "m                                                               [J39a,3]

A critique of the idea of progress, such as may become necessary in connection
with a presentation of Baudelaire, must take great care to differentiate itself from
the latter's own critique of progress. This applies still more unconditionally to
Baudelaire's critique of the nineteenth century and to that entailed by his biogra·
phy. It is a mark of the warped and crassly ignorant portrait of Baudelaire drawn
by Peter Klassen that the poet should appear against the background of a century
painted in the colors of Gehelma. The only thing in this century really worthy of
praise, in the author's view, is a certain clerical practice-namely, that moment
"when, in token of the reestablished kingdom of the grace of God, the Holy of
Holies was carned through the streets of Paris in an entourage of shining arma·
ments. This will have been an experience decisive, because fundamental, for his
entire existence:' So begins this presentation of the poet framed in the depraved
categories of the George circle. Peter Klassen, Baudelaire (Weimar <1931» , p. 9.

profound remark, to make one ponder or dreanl . . . ? If such a remark has been
tluown out, it may indeed have been not by a politician or a philosopher, but by

(.'Is this to say that we must necessarily assimilate Baudelaire to Dante, as M. de
Reynold, following the lead of Ernest Raynaud, has done? If it is a question of
poetic genius, surely admiration . . . can go no further. If it is a question of philo­

time, introduces into his work ideas that are already quite modern, as Lamennais
has nicely demonstrated, whereas Baudelaire . . . gives full expression to the spirit
of the Middle Ages and is, accordingly, behind the times. Thus, if the truth be told,
far from continuing Dante, he differs from him altogether." Paul Souday, "Gon­

From the argument of the Guys essay, it would appear that Baudelaire's fascina­
tion with this artist was connected above all with his handling of backgrounds,
which differs little from the handling of backgrounds in the theater. But because
these pictures, unlike scenery on a stage, are to be viewed from close up, the
magic of distance is canceled for the viewer without his having to renounce
the judgment of distance. In the essay on Guys, Baudelaire has characterized the
gaze which here and in other places he himself turns toward the distance. Baude­
laire dwells on the expression of the oriental courtesan: "She directs her gaze at
the horizon, like a beast of prey; the same wildness, the same indolent distrac­
tion, and also at times the sanle fixity of attention;' eh. E., OeuvreJ) vol. 2,
p. 359.247                                                                  [J47,4]


In his poem L'Heautontimoroumenos" <The Self-Tormentor>, Baudelaire himself
speaks of his shrill voice.                                          [J47,5]

A decisive value is to be accorded Baudelaire's efforts to capture the gaze in
which the magic of distance is extinguished. (Compare "L'Arnour du men­
songe;') Relevant here: my definition of the aura as the aura of distance opened
up with the look that awakens in an object perceived.248                   [J47,6]

into the fixed stare / of satyresses or water sprites" ("L'Avertisseur" ,The Look­

Among the prose poems planned but left unwritten is ""La Fin du monde." Its basic
theme is perhaps best indicated in the following passage from "�Fusees," no. 22:
""The world is about to come to an end. The only reason it should continue is that
it exists. What a weak argument, compared with all the arguments to the contrary,
and especially the following: 'What, in future, is the world to do in the sight of
heaven?' For, supposing it (�ontinued to have material existence, would this exist­
ence be worthy of the name, 01' of the Encyclopedia of History? . . . For my part, I
who sometimes feel myself cast in the ridiculous role of prophet, I know that I shall
never receive so much as a doctor's charity. Lost in this base world, jostled by the
mob, I am like a weary man who sees behind him, in the depths of the years, only
disillusionment and bitterness, and in front of him only a tempest that brings
nothing new. . . . I seem to have wandered off. . . . Nevertheless, I shall let these
pages stand-because I wish to set an exact date to my anger." eh. B . , Oeuvres,
vol. 2 , pp. 639, 641-642. 25°_In the manuscript, there is a variant for the last
word: �\sadness."                                                        [J47a,2]

The piece that begins, "The world is coming to an end" ("Fusees;' no, 22),
contains, interwoven with the apocalyptic reverie, a frightfully bitter critique of
Second Empire society. (It reminds One here and there, perhaps, of Nietzsche's
delineation of "the last man:') Tills critique displays, in part, prophetic features.
Of the coming society, it is said that "nothing in the sanguinary, blasphemous, or
unnatural dreams of the utopians can be compared to what will aCl'llally hap­
pen. . . . Rulers will be compelled, in order to maintain their position and create a
semblance of order, to resort to methods that would appall present-day mankind,
hardened as it is . . . . Justice-if, in this fortunate epoch, any justice can still
exist-will forbid the existence of citizens who are unable to make a fortune. . . .

Baudelaire was always after the gist. His epoch forbade him to formulate it in
such a way that its social bearing would become immediately intelligible. Where
he sought in fact to make it comprehensible-in the essays on Dupont, as in the
theoretical musings in a Christian vein-he instead lost sight of it. Nevertheless,
the formulation he attains at one point in this context-"How much can you get
for a lyre, at the pawnshop?"-gives apt expression to his insistence on an art
that can prove itself before society. The sentence from Ch. B., OeuvreJ, vol. 2,
p. 422 (".cEcole pa'ienne"). 259                                                [J48,9]

It belongs to the physiognomic profile of Baudelaire that he fosters the gestures of
tile poet at the expense of the professional insignia of the writer. In this, he is like
the prostitute who cultivates her physiognomy as sexual object or as "beloved" in
order to conceal her professional dealings.                                    [J48a,2]

If the poems of LeJ EpaveJ, in Proust's great inlage,261 are the foamy wave crests in
the ocean of Baudelairean poetry, then the poems of "Tableaux parisiens)) are its
safe harbor. In particular, these poems contain hardly any echo of the revolution,
ary storms that were breaking over Pa1�s. In this respect they resemble the poetry
of Heym, composed forty years later, in which the corresponding state of affairs
has now risen to consciousness while the "Marseillaise" has been interred. '111e
last two tercets of the sonnet "Berlin III;' which describes the sunset in Berlin in
winter, read as follows:

A paupers' graveyard upheaves black, stone after stone;
The dead look out on the red sunset
From dleir hole. It tastes like strong wine.

They sit knitting all along the wall,
Sooty caps on their naked temples,
To the old attack song, the "Marseillaise."

The idea of the immobilization of nature appears, perhaps as refuge for the
prescient imagination inunediately before the war, in poems by Georg Heym,
whose images the spleen of Baudelarre could not yet have touched: "But the seas
congeal. On the waves / The ships hang rotting, morose:' Georg Heym, Dick­
tungen (Munich, 1922), p. 73 (collection entitled Umbra vitae).        [J48a,S]

It would be a big mistake to see in the theoretical positions on art taken by
Baudelaire after 1852-positions which differ so markedly from those of the
period around 1848-the fruits of a development. (There are not many artists
whose work attests so little to a development as that of Baudelarre.) These
positions represent theoretical extremes, of which the dialectical mediation is
given by Baudelaire's whole oeuvre, without being entirely present to his con­
scious reflection. The mediation resides in the destructive and purificatory char­
acter of the work. This art is useful insofar as it destroys. Its destructive fury is
directed not least at the fetishistic conception of art. Thus it serves "pure" art, iu
the sense of a purified art.                                                  [J4 9,1]

The first poems of Les Fleurs du mal are all devoted to the figure of the poet. From
them it emerges, precisely insofar as the poet makes appeal to a station and a
task, that society no longer has such things to confer.                       [J49,2]

An examination of those places where the "1" appears in the poems of Baudelaire
might result in a possible classificatory grouping. In the first five poems of Les
Fleurs du mal, it surfaces but a single time. And further on, it is not unusual to
find poems in which the "1" does not occur. More essential-and, at the same
time, more deliberate-is the way in other poems, like "Reversibilite" or "Har�
monie du soir;' it is kept in the background.                               [J49,3]

From I.'Quelques mots d'introduction" to the " Salon de 1845" : " And at the very
outset, with reference to that impertinent designation, 'the bourgeois,' we beg to
state that we in no way share the prejudices of our great confreres in the world of
art, who for some years now have been striving their utmost to cast anathema upon
that inoffensive being. , . . And, finally, the ranks of the artists themselves contain
so many hourgeois that it is better, on the whole, to suppress a word which does not
define any particular vice of caste," Oeuvres, vol. 2, pp. 15_16, 265 The same ten­
dency in the preface, I.I.Aux Bourgeois," of the " Salon de 184,6."              (J49,6]
The figure of the lesbian woman belongs among Baudelaire's heroic exemplars.
[He himself gives expression to this in the language of his satanism. It would be
no less comprehensible in an unmetaphysical critical language.] The nineteenth
century began opeuly and without reserve to include the woman in the process
of commodity production. The theoreticians were united in their opinion that
her specific femininity was thereby endangered; masculine traits must necessarily
manifest themselves in women after a while. Baudelaire affirms these traits. At
the same time, however, he seeks to free them from the domination of the
economy. Hence the purely sexual accent which he comes to give this develop­
mental tendency in woman. The paradigm of the lesbian woman bespeaks the
ambivalent position of "modernity" vis-it-vis technological development. (What
he could not forgive in George Sand, presumably, was her having profaned,
through her humanitarian convictions, this image whose traits she bore. Baude­
laire says that she was worse than Sade.)266                              [J49a,1]

The concept of exclusive rights was not so widely accepted in Baudelaire's day as
it is today. Baudelaire often republished his poems two or three times without
having anyone take offense. He ran into difficulties with this only toward the end
of his life, with the Petits Poemes en prose.                              [J49a,2]

From his seventeenth year, Baudelaire led the life of a <litterateur?>. One cannot
say that he ever thought of himself as an "intellectual" or engaged himself on
behalf of "the life of the mind." The registered trademark for artistic production
had not yet been invented. (In this situation, moreover, his imperious need to
distinguish himself and withdraw worked to his advantage.) He refused to go
along with the defamation of the bourgeois, under the banner of which there was
mobilized a solidarity of artists and men of !etters that he considered suspect.
Thus, in the "Musee classique du Bazar Bonne�Nouvellen <Classical Museum of
the Good·News Bazaar> (Oeuvres, vol. 2, p. 61), he writes: "The bourgeois, who
has few scientific notions, goes where the loud voice of the bourgeois artist
directs him.-If this voice were suppressed, the grocer would carry E. Delacroix
around in triumph. The grocer is a great thing, a divine being whom it is neces­
sary to respect, homo bonae valuntatis!,,267 In more detail a year earlier, in the

Baudelaire's eccentric individuality was a mask under which he tried to con­

On "Le Voyage;' opening stanza: the dream of distance belongs to childhood.
The traveler has seen the far distant, but has lost the belief in distance.    [J50,6]

Baudelaire-the melancholic, whose star pointed hin1 into the distance. He didn't
follow it, though. Images of distance appear [in his poems1 only as islands loom­
ing out of the sea of long ago, or the sea of Paris fog. These islands are seldom
lacking in the Negress. And her violated body is the figure in whicl1 the distance
lays itself at the feet of what Baudelaire found near: the Paris of the Second
Empire.                                                                        [JSO,7]

Baudelaire's violent temper belongs together with his destructive animus. We get
nearer the n1atter when we recognize here, too) in these bursts of anger, a
"strange sectioning of time."271                                              USOa,!]

Baudelaire, in his best passages, is occasionally coarse-never sonorous. His
mode of expression at these points deviates as little from his experience as the
gestures of a perfect prelate deviate from his person.                        [JSOa,2]

Although the general contours were by then already lost to view, the concept of
allegory in the first third of the nineteenth century did not have the disconcerting
quality that attaches to it today. In his review of Les Poisies de ]osejJh Delorme, in
Le Globe of April 1 1 , 1829, Charles Magnin brings togetller Victor Hugo and
Sainte-Beuve with the words : "They both proceed almost continually by figures,
allegories, symbols." <Cited in Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve,> Vie, potsies et
pensees de Joseph Delorme (Paris, 1863), vol. 1 , p. 295.                      [J50a,3]

A comparison between Baudelaire and Sainte-Beuve can unfold only within the
narrow confines of subject matter and poetic workmanship. For Sainte-Beuve
was a genial and indeed cozy sort of author. Charles Maguin justly writes in Le
Globe of April 1 1 , 1829: "His spirit might cloud over for a while, but no sooner
does it compose itself than a fund of natural benevolence rises to the surface:'
(Here, it is not the benevolence but the surface that is decisive.) "Without doubt,
this is the source of that sympathy and indulgence which he inspires in us:'
<Cited in> Vie, potsies et pensees de Joseph Delorme (paris, 1863), vol. 1, p. 294.

Miserable sonnet by Sainte-Beuve (Les Consolations [paris, 1863], pp. 262-263) :
"I love Paris and its beautiful sunsets of autunm;' witll the closing lines : "And I
depart, in my thoughts mingling / Paris with an Ithaca of beautiful sunsets:'
[J50a,5]

Charles Magnin in his review of Les Poesies de Joseph Delorme, in Le Globe, April
III 1829: ��Doubtless the alexandrine with a variable caesura calls for a stricter
rhyme." <Cited in} Vie, poesies et pensees de Joseph Delorm,e (Paris � 1863), vol. 1 ,

Conception of the poet, according to Joseph Delorme: "The idea of consorting
with elect beings who sing of their sorrows here below, the idea of groaning in
harmony to their lead, came to him like a smile amid his sufferings and lightened
them a little:' Vie, poesies et pensees de Joseph Delorme (paris, 1863), vol. 1 , p. 16.
The book has an epigraph from Obermann; tlns fact sets a limit to the influence
whim Obermann could have exercised on Baudelaire.                               U5 ! , ! ]

Sainte-Beuve, notes Charles Magnin, half approving and half deploring, "de­
lights in a certain crudity of expression, and abandons himself . . . to a sort of
linguistic shamelessness . . . . The harshest word, however shocking, is almost
always the word he prefers:' Le Globe, April 1 1 , 1829, cited in Vie, potsies et
pensees de Joseph Delorme (paris, 1863), vol. 1 , p. 296. Close on tllls (p. 297),
Maguin reproaches the poet for having presented the girl in the poem "Ma
Muse" as a consumptive: "We would not mind if the poet showed us his muse
poor, grieving, or ill-clad. But consumptive!" TI,e consumptive Negress in
Baudelaire. We get some idea of Sainte-Beuve's innovations from lines like
"nearby, the opening of a ravine: / A girl washes tlrreadbare linen there day after
day" ("Ma Muse;' in vol. 1 , p. 93), or, from a suicide fantasy, "Some local fellows,
/ . , . / Mixingjeers with their stupid stories, / Will chat idly over my blackened
remains / Before packing them off to the graveyard in a wheelbarrow" ("Le
Creux de la vallee;' in vol. 1 , p. 1 14).                                    [J5!,2]
Sainte-Beuve's characterization of his own poetry: (.(.1 have endeavored . . . to be
original in my fashion, which is humble and bourgeois, . . . calling by their name

poesies et pensees de Joseph Delorme (Paris, 1863), vol. 1, p. 170 ("Pensees," no.

With Sainte·Beuve, a standard of sensibility: "Ever siuce our poets, . . . iustead of
sayiug 'a romantic grove; a 'melancholy lake; . . . started sayiug 'a green grove'
and 'a blue lake; alarm has been spreading among the disciples of Madame de
Sta;;1 and the Genevan school; and already complaints can be heard about the
iuvasion of a new materialism. . . . Above all , there is a dread of monotony, and it
seems far too easy and far too simple to say that the leaves are green and the
waves blue. On this poiut, perhaps, the adversaries of the picturesque deceive
themselves. The leaves, iu fact, are not always green; the waves not always blue.
Or rather, we find iu nature . . . neither green, nor blue, nor red, properly speak­
iug; the natural colors of things are colors without names . . . . The picturesque is
not a box of paints that can be emptied." <Sainte-Beuve, Vie, poesies et pensees de
Joseph Delorme (paris, 1863),> pp. 166-167 ("Pensees;' no. 16).               [J5!,4]

(.(,The alexandrine . . . resembles somewhat a pair of tongs, gleaming and golden, if
straight and rigid; it is not for rummaging about in nooks and cl·annies.-Our

but, like them, it has wings." Vie, poesws et pensees de Joseph Delorme (Paris,

Hugo, and Vigny. It notes that they are all informed by I.(.the full, the large, the
copious." Typical is this verse by Rotrou: "I myself have seen them-[the Chris­
tians] looking so serene--- I Driving their hymns to the skies in bulls of bronze"
(p. 154).                                                                   [J5Ia,2]

[J5Ia,3]

In the preface of February 1829, Sainte-Beuve provides the poetry of Joseph
Delorme with a more or less exact social index. He lays weight on the fact that
Delorme comes from a good family, and even more on his poverty and the
humiliations to which it has exposed him.                              [J5!a,4]

What I propose is to show how Baudelaire lies embedded iu the niueteenth
century. The impriut he has left behind there must stand out clear and iutact, like
that of a stone which, having lain iu the ground for decades, is one day rolled
from its place.                                                           U5Ia,5]
The unique importance of Baudelaire resides in his being the first and the most
unflinching to have taken the measure of the self-estranged human being, in the
v
double sense of acknowledging this being and fortifYing it with armor against the
.�   reified world.272                                                            [J5Ia,6]

Nothing comes closer to the task of the ancient hero in Baudelaire's sense-and
in his century-than to give a form to modernity.                             [J5Ia,7]

In the "Salon de 1846" (Oeuvres, vol. 2, p. 134), Baudelaire has described his
social class through the clothes they wear. From this description it emerges that
heroism is a quality of the one who describes, and not at all a quality of his
subject. The "heroism of modern life" is a subterfuge or, if you prefer, a euphe­
mism. The idea of death, from which Baudelaire never broke loose, is the hollow
matrix readied for a knowledge that was not his. Baudelaire's concept of heroic
modernity, it would seem, was first of all this : a monstrous provocation. Analogy
with Daumier.                                                                 [J52,1]

Baudelaire's truest posture is ultimately not that of Hercules at rest but that of the
mime who has taken off his makeup. This gestus is found again in the "ebbings"
of his prosodic construction-something that, for several commentators, is the
most precious element of his ars poetica.                                     [J52,2]

January 15, 1866, to Sainte-Beuve: '!.In certain places in Joseph Delorme I find a

An image that Baudelaire summons to explain his theory of the short poem,
particularly the sonnet, in a letter to Armand Fraisse of February 19, 1860, serves
better than any other description to suggest the way the sky looks in Meryon:
"Have you ever noticed that a section of the sky seen through a vent or between
two chimneys or two rocks, or through an arcade, gives a more profound idea of
the infinite than a great panorama seen from a mountaintop?" eh. B., Lettres

In Le Globe of March 15, 1830, Duvergier de Hauranne writes of Les Consola­

much as his Boulevard d'Enfer" « cited in Sainte-Beuve, Les Consolations [Paris,
1863],> p. 114).                                                                [J52a,5]

Critique of Joseph Delorme and Les Consolations by Farcy, a July insurgent who
fell in battle shortly after composing these lines: "'Lihertinism is poetic when it is a
transport of impassioned principle in us, when it is audacious philosophy, but not
when it is merely a furtive aberration, a shameful confession. This state of mind
. . . ill accords . . . with the poet, who should always go along unaffected, with head
held high, and who requires enthusiasm, or the bitter depths of passion." From
the manuscript pul)lished by C . A. Sainte-Beuve in Les Consolations: Pensees
d'aoil, (Paris, 1863), p . 125.                                                 [J52a,6]

From the critique of Sainte-Beuve by Farcy: "If the crowd is intolerable to him,
the vastness of space oppresses him even more, a situation that is less poetic. He
has not shown the pride or the range to take command of all this nature, to listen
to it, understand it, and render its grand spectacles." "'He was right," comments
Sainte-Beuve (p. 126). C. A. Sainte-Beuve, Les Consolations: Pensees d'aout
[Poesie, de Sainte-Heave, part 2] (Paris, 1863), p. 125.                   [J52a,7]

Baudelaire's oeuvre has perhaps gained importance-moral as well as literary­
through the fact that he left no novel.                                        [J52a,8]
The mental capacities that nlatter in Baudelaire are " souvenirs" of the human
being, somewhat the way medieval allegories are SOUVenITS of the gods. "Baude­
hille;' Claude! once wrote, "takes as his subject the only inner experience left to
.§    people of the nineteenth cenmry-namely, remorse;' Now, this very likely paints


)
...
too rosy a picture: remorse was no less past its time than other inner experiences
formerly canonized. Remorse in Baudelaire is merely a souvenir, like repentance,
virme, hope, and even anguish, which was overtaken the moment it relinquished
its place to marne incuriosite <glum indifference,;' 280               [JS3,1]

As Baudelaire, after 1850, took up the doctrine of l'art pour fart, he explicitly
carried through a renunciation which he had undertaken in sovereign spirit at the
very instant he made allegory into the armamre of his poetry: he gave up using
art as category of the totality of existence.                                    [JS3,2]

The brooder, whose startled gaze falls on the fragment in his hand, becomes an
allegorist.                                                                      [JS3,3]

If we call to mind just how much Baudelaire as a poet had to respect his own
precepts, his own insights, his own taboos, and how strictly circumscribed, on the
other hand, the tasks of his poetic labor were, then we may come to see in him a
heroic trait. There is no other book of poems in which the poet as such presents
himself with so little vanity and so much force. This fact provides a basis for the
frequent compal�son with Dante.                                                  [JS3,4]

What proved so fascinating to Baudelaire in late Latin literature, particularly in

Antiquity and Christianity together determine the historical armature of the
allegorical mode of perception; they provide the lasting mdirnents of the first
allegorical experience-that of the High Middle Ages. "The allegorical outlook
has its origin in the conflict between the guilt-laden physis, held up as an example
by Christianity, and a purer natura deorum [namre of the gods], embodied in tl,e
Pantheon. With the revival of paganism in the Renaissance, and of Christianity
in the Counter-Reformation, allegory, the form of their conflict, also had to be
renewed" « Walter Benjamin"       Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels [Berlin, 1928],
p. 226).283 In Baudelaire's case, the matter is clarified if we reverse the formula.
The allegorical experience was primary for him; one can say that he appropri-
ated from the antique world, as from the Christian, no more dmn he needed to
set going in his poetry that primordial experience-which had a substrate en­
tirely sui generis.                                                  [J53a,1]

TI,e passion for ships and for self-propelled toys is, widl Baudelaire, perhaps only
another expression of the discredit into which, in his view, the world of the
organic has fallen. A sadistic inspiration is palpable here.                 [J53a,2]


"All the miscreants of melodrama-accursed, damned � and fatally marked with a
grin which ruus from ear to ear-are in the pure orthodoxy of laughter. . . .
Laughter is satanic; it is thus profoundly human." Ch. B . , Oeuvres, vol. 2 , p. 171
C�De l'Essence du rire" ). 2!H                                              [J53a,3]

It is a shock that brings someone engrossed in reverie up from the depths.
Medieval legends invoke the state of shock peculiar to the researcher whose
longing for more-than-human wisdom has led hinl to magic; the experience of
shock is cited here as the "derisive laughter of hell:' "Here . . . the muteness of
matter is overcome. In laughter, above all, matter takes on an abundance of spirit,
in highly eccentric disguise. Indeed, it becomes so spiritual that it far outstrips
language. Ainling still higher, it ends in shriIl laughter" (Ursprung des deutschen
Trauerspiels, p. 227).285 Not only was such strident laughter characteristic of
Baudelaire; it reechoed in his ear and gave him much to think about.        [J53a,4]

Laughter is shattered articulation.                                                 [J54 ,1]

On the flight of inlages and the theory of surprise, which Baudelaire shared with
Poe: "Allegories become dated because it is part of their nature to shock:'286 The
succession of allegorical publications in the Baroque represents a sort of flight of
inlages.                                                                     [J54,2]

On petrified unrest and the flight of inlages: "The same tendency is characteristic
of Baroque lyric. The poems have 'no forward movement, but they swell up Ii'om
within.' If it is to hold its own against the tendency toward absorption, the
allegorical must constantly unfold in new and surprising ways:' Ursprung, p. 182
(citing Fritz Strich) .287                                                 [J54,3]

Once the scheme of allegory has been metaphysically determined according to its
threefold illusionary nature, as "illusion of freedom-in the exploration of what is
forbidden; . . . illusion of independence-in the secession from the community of
the pious ; . . . illusion of infinity-in the empty abyss of evi!" ( Ursprung, p. 23 0), 288
then nothing is easier than to assimilate whole groups of Baudelairean poems to
dus desigu. The first part can be represented by the cycle "Fleurs du mal"; the
second part, by the cycle "Revolte"; while the third could be elaborated without
difficulty from "Spleen et ideal."                                                [J54,4]
The image of petrified unrest, iu the Baroque, is "the bleak confusion of Gol­
gotha, which can be recognized as the schema underlying the allegorical figures
iu hundreds of the engravings and descriptions of the period"             ( Ursprung,
p . 232) .289                                                                 [J54,5]


The extent of Baudelaire's impatience can be gauged from these liues iu "Sonnet
d'automne " : "My heart, on which everythiug jars / except the candor of the
primitive animal."290                                                         [J54,6]

Art appears truly bare and austere in the light of an allegorical consideration:

The suffrage of the Heavenly HOSt.292

The affinity Baudelaire felt for late Latin literature is probably counected with his
passion for the allegorical art that had its first flowering in the High Middle Ages.
## [J5 5,17 ]

To attempt to judge Baudelaire's intellectual powers on the basis of his philo­
sophical digressions, asJules Lemaltre has done,'o6 is ill-advised. Baudelaire was a
bad philosopher, a better theorist in matters of art; but only as a brooder was he
incomparable. He has the stereotypy in motif characteristic of the brooder, the
imperturbability in warding off disturbance, the readiness each time to put the
image at the beck and call of the thought. "The brooder is at home among
allegories.                                                                 [J55a,1]

The attraction which a few basic situations continually exerted on Baudelaire
belongs to the complex of symptoms associated with melancholy. He appears to
have been under the compulsion of returning at least once to each of his main
motifs.                                                                     [J55a,2]

Baudelaire's allegory bears traces of the violence that was necessary to demolish
the harmonious fa,ade of the world that surrounded him.                     [J55a,3]

In Blanqui's view of the world, petrified unrest becomes the status of the cosmos
itself. The course of the world appears, accordingly, as one great allegory.
[J55a,4]

Petrified unrest is, moreover, the formula for Baudelaire's life history, which
knows no development.                                                       [J55a,5]

The state of tension subsisting between the most cultivated sensibility and the
most intense contemplation is a mark of the Baudelairean. It is reflected theoreti­
cally in the doctrine of colTespondences and in the predilection for allegory.
Baudelaire never attempted to establish any sort of relations between these.
Nevertheless, such relations exist.                                         [J55a,6]

Misery and terror-which, in Baudelaire, have their armature in allegorical per­
ception-have become, in Rollinat, the object of a genre. (This genre had its
"artistic headquarters" at Le Chat Noir cafe. Its model, if you will, may be found
in a poem like "Le Vin de I'assassin:' Rollinat was one of the house poets at Le
Chat Noir.)                                                                 [J55a,7]

"De I'Essence du rire" contains the theory of satanic laughter. In dus essay,
Baudelaire goes so far as to adjudge even smiling as fundamentally satanic.
Contemporaries testified to something frightful in his own marmer of laughing.
[J55a,8]

That which the allegorical intention has fixed upon is sundered from the custom­
ary contexts of life: it is at Once shattered and preserved. Allegory holds fast to
the ruins. Baudelaire's destructive impulse is nowhere concerned with the aboli­
tion of what falls to it. (But compare "Revolte;']55,<6>.)                     [J56,1]

Baroque allegory sees d,e corpse only from the outside; Baudelaire evokes it
from within.                                                                   [J56,2]

Baudelaire's invectives against mythology recall those of the medieval clerics. He
especially detests chubby-cheeked Cupid. His aversion to this figure has the same
roots as his hatred for Beranger.                                              [J56,3]

Baudelaire regards art's workshop in itself [as a site of confusion,] as the "appara­
tus of destruction" which the allegories so often represent. In the notes he left for
a preface to a projected third edition of Les Fleurs du mal, he writes: "Do we show
the public . . . the mechanism behind our effects? . . . Do we display all the rags,
the paint, the pulleys, the chains, the alterations, the scribbled-over proof sheets­
in short, all the horrors that make up the sanctuary of art?" Ch. B., Oeuvres, vol.
1 , p. 582."'"                                                                  [JS6,4]

In Baudelaire's case, the really decisive indication of class betrayal is not the

Allegory views existence, as it does art, under the sign of fragnlentation and ruin.
L'art pour far! erects the kingdom of art outside profane existence. Common to
both is the renunciation of the idea of harmonious totality in which-according
to the doctrine of German Idealism no less than that of French eclecticism-art
and profane existence are merged.                                           [J56a,6]

In Blanqui's cosmology, everything hinges on the stars, which Baudelaire ban­

The renunciation of the magic o f distance i s a decisive moment in the lyric poetry
of Baudelaire. It has found its sovereign formulation in the first stanza of "Lc

It belongs to the Via Dolorosa of male sexuality that Baudelaire perceived preg­
nancy, in some degree, as unfair competition. On the other hand, solidarity
between impotence and sterility.                                              [J57,!]

The passage in which Baudelaire speaks of his fascination with painted theatrical
backdrops-Where? Qjta,4.                                                      [J57,2]

Baudelaire's destructive impulse is nowhere concerned with the abolition of what
falls to it. This is reflected in his allegory and is the condition of its regressive
tendency. On the other hand, allegory has to do, precisely in its destmctive furor,
with dispelling the illusion that proceeds from all "given order;' whether of art or
of life: the illusion of totality or of organic wholeness which transfigures timt
order and makes it seem endurable. And this is the progressive tendency of
allegory.                                                                     [J57,3]

Whenever humanity-aspiring after a purer, nl0re iml0cent, more spiritual exist­
ence than it has been granted-looked around for a token and pledge of this
existence in nature, it generally found it in tile plant or animal kingdom. Not so
Baudelaire. His dream of such an existence disdains community with any terres­
trial nature and holds to the clouds. Many of his poems contain cloud motifs [not
to mention the transfiguration of Paris in "Paysage" <Landscape>] . What is most
appalling is the defilement of the clouds ("La Beatrice").                     [J57,4]

From the perspective of spleen, the buried man is the "1ranscendental subject of

On the image of the crowd in Poe: How well can the image of the big city turn
out when the register of its physical dangers-to say nothing of the danger to
which it itself is exposed-is as incomplete as it is at the time of Poe or Baudelaire?

Baudelaire would never have written poems, if he had had merely the motives
for doing so that poets usually have.                                         [J57a,l]

On impotence. Baudelaire is a "maniac, in revolt against his own impotence."
Incapable of satisfying the sexual needs of a woman, he made a virtue of neces­
sity in sabotaging the spiritual needs of his contemporaries. He himself did not
fail to notice the connection, and his consciousness of this COIDlcction is seen
most clearly in his style of humor. It is the cheerless humor of the rebel, not for a
moment to be confused with the geniality of scoundrels, which at that time was
already on the rise. This type of reaction is something very French; its nanle, la
rogne, is not easily rendered into other languages.""                         [J57a,2]

It is in its transitoriness that modernity shows itself to be ultimately and most
intimately akin to antiquity. The unintenupted resonance which Les Fleurs du
mal has found up through the present day is linked to a certain aspect of the
urban scene, one that carne to light only with the city's entry into poetry. It is the
aspect least of all expected. What makes itself felt through the evocation of Paris
in Baudelaire's verse is the infirmity and decrepitude of a great city. Nowhere,
perhaps, has this been given more perfect expression than in the poem "Crepus­
cule du matin;' which is the awakening sob of the sleeper, reproduced in the
materials of urban life. This aspect, however, is more or less common to the
whole cycle of "Tableaux parisiens;" it is present in the transparence of the city, as
conjured by "Le Soleil;' no less than in the allegorical evocation of the Louvre in
"Le Cygne."                                                                 [J57a,3]

On the physiognomy of Baudelaire as that of the mime: Courbet reports that he

With the inhabitants of Romance-language nations, a refinement of the sen­
sorium does not diminish the power of sensuous apprehension. With the Ger­
mans, on the other hand, the refinement, the advancing cultivation of sensuous
enjoyment is generally purchased with a decline in the art of apprehension; here,
the capacity for pleasure loses in concentration what it gains in delicacy. (Com­
pare the "reek of wine-casks"318 in "Le Vm des chiffonniers.")             [J57a,5]

The eminent aptitude for pleasure on the part of a Baudelaire has nothing at all
to do with any sort of coziness. The fundamental incompatibility of sensuous
pleasure with what is called Gemutlichkeit is the mark of an authentic culture of
the senses. Baudelaire's snobbism is the eccentric repudiation of complacency,
and his satanism is the readiness to subvert this habit of mind wherever and
whenever it should arise.                                                 [J58,l]

The streets of Paris, in Meryon's rendering, are chasms, high above which float

Baudelaire wanted to make room for his poems, and to this end he had to push
aside others. He managed to devalue certain poetic liberties of the Romantics
through his classical deployment of rhyme, as he devalued the traditional alexan­
drine through his introduction of certain ebbings and points of rupture. In short,
his poems contained special provisions for the elimination of competitors.
## [J58 ,3]

Baudelaire was perhaps the first to have had the idea of a market-oriented origi­
nality, which just for that reason was more original in its day than any other. The
creation of his poncif,ng led him to adopt methods that were the stock in trade of
the competition. His defamatory remarks about Musset Or Beranger have just as
much to do with this as his imitations of Victor Hugo.                       [158,4]

The relation of the crowd to the individual comes, practically of itself, to unfold
as a metaphor in which the differing inspirations of these two poets-Hugo and
Baudelaire-can be grasped. Words, like images, present themselves to Hugo as
a surging, relentless mass. With Baudelaire, in contrast, tlley take the side of the
solitary who, to be sure, fades into the multitude, but not before appearing with
singular physiognomy to one who allows her gaze to linger.                   [ 158,5 1

The idea of Baudelaire's aesthetic Passion has given to many parties in the critical

There are weighty historical circumstances makiug the Golgotha-way of impo­
tence trod by Baudelaire iuto one marked out in advance by his society. Only this
would explain how it was that he drew, as traveling expenses along the way, a
precious old coiu from among the accumnlated treasures of this society. It was
the coiu of allegory, with the scythe-wielding skeleton on one side, and, on the
obverse, the figure of Melancholy plunged in meditation.                    [J58a,2]

The key to Baudelaire's relationship with Gautier is to be sought iu the more or
less clear awareness of the younger man [?] that even in art his destructive
impulse encounters no iuviolable limit. In fact, such a 1inrit carmot withstand the
allegorical intention. Moreover, Baudelaire could hardly have written his essay
on Dupont if the critique of the concept of art entailed by the latter's established
practice had not corresponded to his own radical critique. In referriug to Gautiel;
Baudelaire successfully undertook to cover up these tendencies.             [J58a,4]

Streets of ill repute. Considering the importance of forbidden forms of sexuality
iu Baudelaire's life and work, it is remarkable that the bordello plays no role iu

Bonnes Soeurs:'                                                             [J58a,6]

thy than the fact that it was regularly composed iu the presence of such phenom­
ena. For Hugo iu exile, the unfathomable, insistent swarm of the spirit world
takes the place of the public.                                               [J59,3]

The primary interest of allegory is not liuguistic but optical. "Inlages-my great,
my priuutive passion:""                                                      [J59,4]
The elaborate theorems with which the principle of "art for art's sake" was
enunciated by its original proponents, as by subsequent literary history, ulti­
mately come down to a specific thesis: that sensibility is the true subject of poetry.
Sensibility is, by its nature, involved in suffering. If it experiences its highest
concretization, its richest determination, in the sphere of the erotic, then it must
find its absolute consummation, which coincides with its transfiguration, in the
Passion. It will define the idea of an "aesthetic Passion!' The concept of the
aesthetic appears here with precisely the signification that Kierkegaard gives it in

� =��                                                                          � 9�

The poetics of I 'art pour l'art blends seamlessly into the aesthetic Passion of Les
Fleun du mal.                                                                  [J59,6]

The "loss of a halo"323 conCerns the poet first of all. He is obliged to exhibit
himself in his own person on the market. Baudelaire played this role to the hilt. His
famous mythomania was a publicity stunt.                                       [J59,7]

The new dreariness and desolation of Paris, as it is described by Veuillot, comes
on the scene, together with the dreariness of men's attire, as an essential moment
in the image of modernity.                                                     [J59,8]

Mystification, with Baudelaire, is an apotropaic magic, similar to the lie among
prostitutes.                                                                   [J59,9]

The commodity form emerges in Baudelaire as the social content of the allegori­
cal form of perception. Form and content are united in the prostitute, as in their
synthesis.                                                                   [J59,lO]

Baudelaire perceived the significance of the mass-produced article as clearly as
did Balzac. In this, his "Americanism;' of which Laforgue speaks, has its finnest
foundation. He wanted to create a ponci/, a cliche. Lemaitre assures him that he
succeeded.                                                                    [J59a,1]

Apropos of Valery's reflections on the situation of Baudelaire. It is important that
Baudelaire met with competitive relations in the production of poetry. Of course,
rivalry between poets is as old as the hills. But in the period around 1830, these
rivalries began to be decided on the open market. It was victory in that fie!d-,md
not the patronage of the gentry, princes, or the clergy-that was to be won. This
condition weighed more heavily on the lyric than on other fonns of poetry. The
disorganization of styles and of poetic schools is the complement of that market,
which reveals itself to the poet as the "public." Baudelaire was not based in any
style, and he had no school. It was a real discovery for him that he was compet­
ing against individuals.                                                      [J59a,2]
Les Fleun du mal may be considered an arsenal. Baudelaire wrote certain of his
poems in order to destroy others written before him.                           [J59a,3]

No one ever felt less at home in Paris than Baudelaire. Every intimacy with things
is alien to the allegorical intention. To touch on things means, for it, to violate
them. To recognize things means, for it, to see through them. Wherever the
allegorical intention prevails, no habits of any kind can be formed. Hardly has a
thing been taken up than allegory has dispensed with the situation. Thing and
situation become obsolete for allegory more quickly than a new pattern for the
milliner. But to become obsolete means: to grow strange. Spleen lays down
centuries between the present moment and the one just lived. It is spleen that
tirelessly generates "antiquity;' And in fact, with Baudelaire, modernity is noth­
ing other than the "newest antiquity;' Modernity, for Baudelaire, is not solely
and not primarily the object of his sensibility; it is the object of a conquest.
Modernity has, for its armature, the allegorical mode of vision.               [J59a,4]

The correspondence between antiquity and modernity is the sole constructive
conception of history in Baudelaire. With its rigid armature, it excludes every
dialectical conception.                                                        [J59a,5]

On the phrase, "I have little to do with such things;'324 in the draft of a preface to
Les Fleurs du mal. Baudelaire, who never founded a family, has given the word
"familiar" in his poetry an inflection filled with meaning and with promise such
as it never before possessed. It is like a slow, heavily laden haywagon in which the
poet carts to the barn everything which throughout his life he had to renounce.
Compare "Correspondances," "Bohemiens en voyage," �'Obsession:'                 [J60,1)

The passage "where everything, even horror, turns to magic"325 could hardly be
better exemplified than by Poe's description of the crowd.                      [J60,2]

Concerning the opening line from "La Servante au grand coeur": on the words
"of whom you were so jealous11326 falls an accent that onc would not necessarily
expect. The voice, as it were, draws back from ')ealous;' Therein lies the frailty
of this already long-past situation.                                            [J60,3]

On "Spleen I": through the word "mortality;' the city with its offices and its

[J60,4]

The whore is the most precious booty in the triumph of allegory-the life which
signifies death. This quality is the only thing about her that cannot be bought,
and for Baudelaire it is the only thing that matters.                           [J60,5]

Around the middle of the century, the conditions of artistic production under­
went a change. This change consisted in the fact that for the first time the form of
the commodity imposed itself decisively on the work of art, and the form of the
masses on its public. Particularly vulnerable to these developments, as can be
seen now unmistakably in our century, was the 1Y'�c. It is the unique distinction
of Les FleuIJ du rnal that Baudelaire responded to precisely these altered condi·
tions with a book of poems. It is the best example of heroic conduct to be found
in his life.                                                                [J60,6]

The heroic bearing of Baudelaire is akin to that of Nietzsche. Though Baudelaire
likes to appeal to Catholicism, his historical experience is nonetheless that which
Nietzsche fixed in the phrase "God is dead;' In Nietzsche's case, this experience
is projected cosmologically in the thesis that nothing new occurs any more. In
Nietzsche, the accent lies on eternal recurrence, which the human being has to
face with heroic COlllposure. For Baudelaire, it is nlore a matter of "the new;'
which must be wrested heroically from what is always again the same.        [J60,7]

The historical experiences which Baudelaire was one of the first to undergo (it is
no accident that he belongs to the generation of Marx, whose principal work
appeared in the year of his death) have become, in our day, only more wide·
spread and persistent. The traits displayed by capital in June 1848 have, since
then, been engraved still more sharply in the ruling classes. And the particular
difficulties involved in mastering the poetry of Baudelaire are the obverse of d,e
ease with which one can give oneself up to it. In a word, there is nothing yet
obsolete about dlis poetry. This fact has determined the character of most of the
books concerned widl Baudelaire: they are feuiJIetons on an expanded scale.
[J60a,1]

Particularly toward the end of his life, and in view of d,e linllted success of his
work, Baudelaire more and more threw himself into the bargain. He flung hinl·
self after his work, and thus, to the end, confirmed in his own person what he had
said about the unavoidable necessity of prostitution for the poet.         [J60a,2]

One encounters an abundance of stereotypes in Baudelaire, as in the Baroque
poets.                                                                     [J60a,3]

For the decline of the aura, One thing within the realm of mass production is of
overriding inlportance: the massive reproduction of the inlage.            [J60a,4]

lnlpotence is the key figure of Baudelaire's solitude.327 An abyss divides hinl from
his fellow men. It is this abyss of which his poetry speaks.               [J60a,5]

We may assume that the crowd as it appears in Poe, with its abrupt and intermit·
tent movements, is described quite realistically. In itself, the description has a
higher truth. These are less the movements of people going about their business
than the movements of the machines they operate. With uncanny foresight, Poe
seems to have modeled the gestures and reactions of the crowd on the rhythm of
these machines. The flaneur, at any rate, has no part in such behavior. Instead, he
forms an obstacle in its path. His nonchalance would therefore be nothing other
than an unconscious protest against the tempo of the production process. (Com­
pare D2a,1.)                                                                  [J60a,6]

Fog appears as a consolation of the solitary man. It fills the abyss surrounding
him.                                                                          [J60a,7]

Baudelaire's candidacy for the Academie was a sociological experiment.         [J6I,I]

Baudelaire's allegorical mode of vision was not understood by any of his contem­
poraries and was thus, in the end, completely overlooked.                      [J6I,3]

Surprising proclamations and mystery-mongering, sudden attacks and impene­
trable irony, belong to the raiJon d'etat of the Second Empire and were charac­
teristic of Napoleon III. They are no less characteristic of the theoretical writings
of Baudelaire.                                                                 [J6I ,4]

The cosmic shudder in Victor Hugo has little in common with the naked terror
that seized Baudelaire in his spleen. Hugo felt perfectly at home in the world of
the spirits. It is the complement of his domestic existence, which was itself not
without horror.                                                                [J6I,5]

The veiled import of the first section of "Chant d'automne": the season is named
only in the tiny phrase "autumn is here!""9 and the following line says that, for
the poet, it has no other meaning than as a foreboding of death. To him, it has
brought no harvest.                                                            [J6I,6]

In the guise of a beggar, Baudelaire continually put the model of bourgeois
society to the test. His willfully induced, if not deliberately maintained, depend­
ence on his mother not only has a psychoanalytically identifiable cause; it also
has a social cause.                                                            [J61,7]

The labyrinth is the right path for him who always arrives early enough at his
destination. For the fl:'i.neur, this destination is the marketplace.          [J6I ,S]

The path of one who shrinks from arriving at his goal will easily take the form of
a labyrinth. [For the fl:'i.neur, this goal is the marketplace.] The same holds for the
social class that does not want to know where it is heading. Moreover, nothing
prevents it from reveling in this roundahout way and hence substituting the
shudder of pleasure for the shudder of death. This was the case for the society of
the Second Empire.                                                             [J6I,9]
What concerned Baudelaire was not manifest and short-term demand, but latent
and long-term demand. Les FleU1J du mal demonstrates not only that he correctly
assessed such a demand but, in addition, that this sureness in evaluation is
inseparable from his significance as a poet.                                    [J61,10]

One of the most powerful attractions of prostitution appears only with the rise of
the metropolis-namely, its operation in the mass and through the masses. It was
the existence of the masses that first enabled prostitution to overspread large
areas of the city, whereas earlier it had been confined, if not to houses, at least to
the streets. The masses first made it possible for the sexual object to be reflected
simultaneously in a hundred different forms of allurement-forms which the
object itself produced. Beyond this, salability itself can become a sexual stimulus;
and this attraction increases wherever an abundant supply of women under­
scores their character as commodity. With the exhibition of girls'"'' in rigidly
uniform dress at a later period, the music hall review explicitly introduced the
mass-produced article into the libidinal life of the big-city dweller.          [J6 1 a, 1 ]

As a matter of fact, if the rule of the bonrgeoisie were one day to b e stabilized
(which never before has happened, and never can) , then the vicissitudes of
history would in actnality have no more claim on the attention of thinkers than a
child's kaleidoscope, which with every tum of the hand dissolves the established
order into a new array. As a matter of fact, the concepts of the ruling class have in
every age been the mirrors that enabled an image of "order" to prevail.         [J61a,2]

In L'Eternite par les astl�s, Blanqui displayed no antipathy to the belief in prog­
ress; between the lines, however, he heaped scorn on the idea. One should not
necessarily conclude from this that he was untrue to his political credo. The
activity of a professional revolutionary such as Blanqui does not presuppose any
faith in progress; it presupposes only the determination to do away with present
injustice. The irreplaceable political value of class hatred consists precisely in its
affording the revolutionary class a healthy indifference toward speculations con­
cerning progress. Indeed, it is just as worthy of humane ends to rise up out of
indignation at prevailing injustice as to seek through revolution to better the
existence of future generations. It is just as worthy of the human being; it is also
more like the human being. Hand in hand with such indignation goes the firm
resolve to snatch humanity at the last moment from the catastrophe looming at
every tum_ That was the case with Blanqui. He always refused to develop plans
for what comes "later:'                                                         [J61a,3]

Baudelaire was obliged to lay claim to the dignity of the poet in a society that had
no more dignity of any kind to confer. Hence the bozifJonnerie of his public
appearances.                                                                     [J62,1]

The figure of Baudelaire has passed into his fame. For the petty-bourgeois mass
of readers, his story is an image d'Epinal, an illustrated "life history of a libertine:'
This image has contributed greatly to Baudelaire's reputation-little though its
purveyors may have numbered aIUong his friends. Over this image another
imposes itself, one that has had a less widespread but more lasting effect: it shows
Baudelaire as exemplar of an aesthetic Passion.                               [J62,2]

The aesthete in Kierkegaard is predestined to the Passion. See "TI,e Unhappiest
Man" in Either/G:                                                       [J62,3]

The grave as the secret chamber in which Eros and Sexus settle their ancient

The stars in Baudelaire represent a picture puzzle (Ikxierbild> of the commodity.
They are the everSaIUe in great masses.                                    [J62,5]

Baudelaire did not have the humanitarian idealism of a Victor Hugo or a La­
martine. The emotional buoyancy of a Musset was not at his disposal. He did
not, like Gautier, take pleasure in his times, nor could he deceive hinlself about
them like Leconte de Lisle. It was not given hinl to find a refuge in devotions, like
Verlaine, nor to heighten the youtluul vigor ofhis lyric elan through the betrayal
of his adulthood, like Rimbaud. As rich as Baudelaire is in knowledge of his craft,
he is relatively unprovided with stratagems to face the times. And even tl,e grand
tragic part he had composed for the arena of his day-the role of the "mod­
ern"-could be filled in the end only by himself. All this Baudelaire no doubt
recognized. The eccentricities in which he took such pleasure were those of the
mime who has to perform before a public incapable of following the action on the
stage-a mime, furthermore, who knows this about his audience and, in his
performance, allows tl,at knowledge its rightful due.                        [J62,6]

In the psychic economy, the mass-produced aTtide appears as obsessional idea. [It
answers to no natural need.] The neurotic is compelled to cl1armel it violently
aIUong the ideas within the natural circulation process.                [J62a,l]

TI1e idea of eternal recurrence transfonns the historical event itself into a mass­
produced article. But this conception also displays, in another respect-on its
obverse side, one could say-a trace of the economic circumstances to which it
owes its sudden topicality. This was manifest at the moment the security of the
conditions of life was considerably diminished through an accelerated succession
of crises. The idea of etenJa.i recurrence derived its luster from the fact that it was
no longer possible, in all circumstances, to expect a recurrence of conditions
across any interval of time shorter than that provided by eternity. The quotidian
constellations very gradually began to be less quotidian. Very gradually their
recurrence became a little less frequent, and there could arise, in consequence,
the obscure presentiment that henceforth one I11USt rest content with cosmic
constellations. Habit, in short, made ready to surrender some of its prerogatives.
Nietzsche says, "I love short-lived habits;'''''l and Baudelaire already, tlu'oughout
his life, was incapable of developing regular habits. Habits are the armature of
long experience <Edidzrung>, whereas they are decomposed by individual experi­
ences <Erlebnisse>.                                                           [J62a,2]

Baudelaire's desire to write a book in which he would spew his disgust with

On impotence. Around the middle of the century, the bourgeois class ceases to
be occupied with the future of the productive forces it has unleashed. (Now
appear those counterparts to the great utopias of a More or Campanella, who
had welcomed the accession of this class and affirmed the identity of its interests
with the demands of freedom and justice-now appear, that is to say, the utopias
of a Bellamy or a Mollin, which are mainly concerned with touching up the
notion of economic consumption and its incentives.) In order to concern itself
further with the future of the productive forces which it had set going, the
bourgeoisie would first of all have had to renounce the idea of private income.
That the habit of "coziness" so typical of bourgeois comfort around midcentury
goes together with this lassitude of the bourgeois imagination, that it is one with
the luxury of "never having to think about how the forces of production must
develop in their hands"-these things admit of very little doubt. The dream of
having children is merely a beggarly stimulus when it is not imbued with the
dream of a new nature of tlrings in which these children might one day live, or for
which they can struggle. Even the dream of a "better hmnanity" in which our
children would "have a better life" is only a sentimental fantasy reminiscent of
Spitzweg when it is not, at bottom, the dream of a better nature in which they
would live. (Herein lies the inextinguishable claim of the Fourierist utopia, a
claim which Marx had recognized [and which Russia had begun to act on].) The
latter dream is the living source of the biological energy of humanity, whereas the
former is only the muddy pond from which the stork draws children. Baude­
laire's desperate thesis concerning children as the creatures closest to original sin
is not a bad complement to this image.                                      [J63a,1]

It is inlpotence that makes for the bitter cup of male sexuality. From this impo­
tence springs Baudelaire's attachment to the seraphic image of woman, as well as
his fetishism. It follows that Keller's "sin of the poet"-namely, "to invent sweet
images of women, I such as bitter earth never harbors"341-is certainly not his.
Keller's women have the sweetness of cllln,eras. Baudelaire, in his female figures,
remains precise, and therefore French, because with him the fetishistic and the
seraphic elements do not coincide, as they always do in Keller.               [J64,1]

The mythic concept of the task of the poet ought to be defined through the
profane concept of the instrument.-The gteat poet never confronts his work
simply as the producer; he is also, at the same time, its consumer. Naturally, in
contrast to the public, he consumes it not as entertainment but as tool. This
instrumental character represents a use value that does not readily enter into the
exchange value.                                                            [J64,3]

On Baudelaire's "Crepuscule du soir": the big city knows no true evening twi­
light. In any case, the artificial lighting does away with all transition to night. The
same state of affairs is responsible for the fact that the stars disappear from the
sky over the metropolis. Who ever notices when they come out? Kant's tran­
scription of the sublime through "the starry heavens above me and the moral law
within me""" could never have been conceived in these terms by an inhabitant of

De Maistre on the "savage"-a reflection directed against Rousseau: "One need
only glance at the savage to see the curse written . . . on the external form of his
body. . . . A formidable hand weighing on these doomed races wipes out in them
the two distinetive characteristics of our grandeur: foresight and perfectibility.
The savage cuts the tree down to gather the fruit; he unyokes the ox that the

'"'But do you realize, gentlemen, the source of this flood of insolent doctrines which
unceremoniously judge God and call him to account for his orders? They come to
us from that great phalanx we call savants <intellectuals> and whom we have not
been ahle in tIris age to keep in their place, which is a secondary one. At other
times, there were very few sa'vants, and a very small minority of this very small
minority were ungodly; today one sees nothing but savants . It is a profession, a
crowd, a nation, and among them the already unfortunate exception has become
the rule. On every side they have usurped a limitless influence; yet if there is one
thing eertain in this world, it is, to my mind, that it is not for seienee to guide men.
Nothing necessary for this is entrusted to science. One would have to he out of
one's mind to believe that God has charged the academies with teaching us what he
is and what we owe to him. It rests with the prelates, the nobles, the great officers
of state to be the repositories and guardians of the saving truths, to teach nations
what is had and what good, what true and what false, in the moral and spiritual
order. Others have no right to reason on this kind of matter. They have the natura]

On judicial procedures: "'"Under the rule of Muslim law, authority punishes, even
with death, the man it thinks deserves it, at the very moment and place it seizes
him; this brusque enforcement of the law, which has not lacked blind. admirers, is
nevertheless one of the many proofs of the brutalization and divine censure of
these peoples. Among us, things are quite different. The culprit must be arrested;
he must be charged; he must defend himself'; he must above all settle his conscience
and his worldly affairs; practical arrangements for his punishment must be made.
Finally, to take everything into account, a certain time must he left to take him to
the appointed place of punishment. The scaffold is an altar; it cannot therefore he
either set up in a certain place or moved, except by authority. These delays,
praiseworthy in their very excessiveness, yet still not lacking their hlind detrac­
tors, are no less a proof of our superiority. "' De Maistre, Les Soirees de Saint­

There is, in Baudelaire a latent tension between the destructive and the idyllic
aspects of death-between its bloody and its palliative nature.              [J65a,2]

The historicism of the nineteenth century is the background against which
Baudelaire's "pursuit of modernity" stands out. (Villemain, Cousin.)         []65a,5]

So long as there is semblance in history, it will find in nature its ultimate refuge.
The connnodity, which is the last burning-glass of historical semblance <Schein>,
celebrates its triumph in the fact that nature itself takes on a commodity charac­
ter. It is this commodity appearance < T%renschein> of nature that is embodied in
the whore. "Money feeds sensuality;' it is said, and this formula in itself affords
only the barest outline of a state of affairs that reaches well beyond prostitution.
Under the dominion of the commodity fetish, the sex appeal of the woman is
more or less tinged with the appeal of the connnodity. It is no accident that the
relations of the pimp to his girlfriend, whom he sells as an "article" on the
market, have so inflamed the sexual fantasies of the bourgeoisie. The modern
advertisement shows, from another angle, to what extent the attractions of the
woman and those of the commodity can be merged. The sexuality that in former
times-on a social level-was stimulated through imagining the future of the
productive forces is mobilized now through imagining the power of capital.
[]65a,6]

The circumstance of the new is perhaps nowhere better illunlinated than in the
figure of the flilnem: His thirst for the new is quenched by the crowd, which
appears self-impelled and endowed with a soul of its own. In fact, this collective is
nothing but appearance. This "crowd;' in which the flilneur takes delight, is just
the empty mold with which, seventy years later, the Volhsgemeinschafl <People's
Connnunity,'52 was cast. The fl�neur who so prides himself on his alertness, on
his nonconformity, was in this respect also ahead of his contemporaries: he was
the first to fall victim to an ignis fatuus which since that time has blinded many
millions.                                                                    [J66,!]

Baudelaire idealizes the experience of the commodity, in that he ascribes to it, as
canon, the experience of a1legoty.                                           [J66,2]

If it is imagination that presents correspondences to the memory, it is thinking
that consecrates allegory to it. Memory brings about the convergence of imagina­
tion and thinking.                                                           [J66,3]

With the new manufacturing processes that lead to imitations, semblance is
consolidated in the commodity.                                               [J66,4]

Between the theory of natural correspondences and the repudiation of nature
exists a contradiction. It is resolved insofar as within the memory impressions
become detached from individual experiences, so that the long experience stored
up in those impressions is released and can be fed into the allegoricalfunduJ. <See

With Meryon, cile majesty and decrepitude of Paris come into their own.
[J66,7]

In the form taken by prostitution in the big cities, the woman appears not only as
commodity but, in a precise sense, as mass-produced article. This is indicated by
the masking of individual expression in favor of a professional appearance, such
as makeup provides. The point is made still more emphatically, later on, by the
uniformed girls of the music-hall review.                                    [J66,8]

Baudelaire's opposition to progress was the indispensable condition for his suc­
cess at capturing Paris in his poetry. Compared with this poetry, all later big-city
lyric must be accounted feeble. What it lacks is precisely that reserve toward its
subject matter which Baudelaire owed to his frenetic hatred of progress.
[J66a,!]

In Baudelaire, Paris as an emblem of antiquity contrasts with its masses as an

To the flaneur, his city is-even if, like Baudelaire, he happened to be born
there-no longer native ground. It represents for him a theatrical display, an

In the erotology of the damned-as that of Baudelairc nlight be called-infertility
and impotence are the decisive factors. They alone are what give to the cruel and
ill-famed moments of desire in sexual life a purely negative character-something
that is lost, it goes without saying, in the act of procreation, as in relations de­
signed to last an entire lifetime (that is, in maniage) . These realities instituted for
the long tenn-children, marriage-would lack all assurance of longevity, had
not the most destructive energies of the human being entered into their creation,
contributing to their stability not less but more than many another energy. But
these relations are legitimated, through this contribution, only to the extent that
this is really possible for decisive libidinal movements in present-day society.
[]66a,9]

The social value of marriage rests decidedly on its longevity, insofar as this latter
holds within it the idea of an ultimate and definitive-if continually defened­
"confrontation" of the spouses. From this confrontation the couple are preserved
so long as the marriage itself lasts-which is to say, in principle, for the rest of
their lives.                                                                     [J67,1]

Relation between commodity and allegory: "value," as the natural burning-glass
of semblance in history, outshines "meaning." Its luster <Schein> is more difficult
to dispel. It is, moreover, the very newest. In the Baroque age, the fetish character
of the cOlmnodity was still relatively undeveloped. And the cOlmnodity had not
yet so deeply engraved its stigma-the proletarianization of the producers-on the
process of production. Allegorical perception could thus constitute a style in the
seventeenth century, in a way that it no longer could in the nineteenth. Baude­
laire as allegorist was entirely isolated. He sought to recall the experience of the
coil1ll10dity to an allegorical experience. In this, he was doomed to founder, and
it became clear that the relentlessness of his initiative was exceeded by the relent-
1essness of reality. Hence a strain in his work that feels pathological or sadistic
only because it nllssed out on reality-thoughjust by a hair.                     [J67,2]

It is one and the same historical night at the onset of which the owl of Minerva

The experience of allegory, which holds fast to ruins, is properly the experience
of eternal transience.                                                          [J67,4]


Prostitution can lay claim to being considered "work" the moment work be­
comes prostitution. In fact, the lorette354 was the first to carry out a radical renun­

there, it is only a short distance to those who demand "wages."                 [J67,5]


Already at work inJugendstil is the bourgeois tendency to set nature and technol­
ogy in mutual opposition, as absolute antitheses. TIms, Futurism will later give
to technology a destructive antinatural accent; in Jugendstil, the energies des­
tined to operate in this direction are beginning to unfold. The idea of a world
bewitched and, as it were, denatured by technological development informs a
good many of its creations.                                                     [J67,6]


The prostitute does not sell her labor power; her job, however, entails the fiction
that she sells her powers of pleasure. Insofar as this represents the utmost exten­
sion attainable by the sphere of the commodity, the prostitute may be cousidered,
from early on, a precursor of commodity capitalism. But precisely because the
conmlOdity character was in other respects undeveloped, this aspect did not need
to stand out so glaringly as would subsequently be the case. As a matter of fact,
prostitution in the Middle Ages does not, for example, display the crudeness that
in the nineteenth century would become the rule.                              [J67a,l]


The tension between emblem and commercial logo makes it possible to measure

Strong fixations of t1,e sense of smell, such as Baudelaire seems to have known,

Hollowing out of the inner life. Of the infinite regress of reflection that, in Ro­
manticism, in a spirit of play, both expanded the space of life in ever-widening
circles and reduced it within ever narrower frames, there remained to Baudelaire
only the "somber and lucid exchange" with himself, as he represents it in the
in1age of a conversation between the jack of hearts and the queen of spades in an
old pack of cards. Later, Jules Renard will say: "His heart . . . more alone than
an ace of hearts in the middle of a deck of cards:" ;;                        [J67a,5]


There may well be t1,e closest connection between the allegorical imagination

"La Destruction" on the demon: "he fills my burning lungs / with sinful cravings
never satisfied:"'" 1ne lung as the seat of desire is the boldest intimation of
desire's unrealizability that can be imagined. Compare the invisible stream in

Of all the Baudelairean poems, "La Destruction" comprises the most relentless
elaboration of the allegorical intention. The "bloody retinue;' which the poet is
forced by the demon to contemplate, is the court of allegory-the scattered
apparatus by dint of which allegory has so disfigured and so unsettled the world
of things that only the fragments of that world are left to it now, as object of its
brooding. The poem breaks off abruptly; it itself gives the impression-doubly
surprising in a sonnet-of something fragmentary.                            [J68,2]

Compare �'Le Vin des chiffonniers" with ��Dans ce Cabriolet/� by Sainte-Beuve
« Les Consol"tions,> vol. 2 [Paris, 1863], p . 193):
Seated in this cabriolet, I examine the man
Who drives me, the man who�s little morc than machine,
Hideous with his thick beard, his long matted hair:
Vice and wine and sleep weigh down his sottish eyes.
How far then, I thought, can humanity sink?
And I draw hack to the other cornel' of the seat.

The poet goes on to ask himself whether his own soul is not just as unkempt as the
soul of the coachman. Baudelaire mentions this poem in his letter of January 15,
1866, to Sainte-Beuve.""                                                   [J68,3]

The ragpicker is the most provocative figure of human misery. "Ragtag" <Lump­
enproletarier> in a double sense: clothed in rags and occupied with rags. "Here
we have a man whose job it is to pick up the day's rubbish in the capital. He
collects and catalogues everything that the great city has cast off, everything it
has lost, and discarded, and broken. He goes through the archives of debauchery,
and the jumbled array of refuse. He makes a selection, an intelligent choice; like
a miser hoarding treasure, he collects the garbage that will become objects of
utility or pleasure when refurbished by Industrial magic" ("Du Vrn et du
o
en   haschisch;' Oeuvres, vol. 1 , pp. 249-250). As may be gathered from this prose
M
description of 1851, Baudelaire recognizes himself in the figure of the ragman.
The poem presents a fi.lrther affinity with the poet, immediately noted as such: "a
ragpicker stumbles past, wagging his head I and bumping into walls with a poet's
grace, I pouring out his heartfelt schemes to one I and all, including spies of the
police;' "'"                                                                [J68,4)


Much can be said on behalf of the supposition that "Le Vm des chiffonniers" was
written around the time of Baudelaire's espousal of "beautifi.ll utility;' (The
question ealIDot be settled with any certainty, because the poem first appeared in
the book edition of Les Fleurs du mal.-"Le Vin de l'assassin" was published for
the first time in 1848-in L'Echo des marchand> de vins!) The ragpicker poem
strenuously disavows the reactionary pronouncements of its author. The criti­
cism on Baudelaire has overlooked this poem.                              [J68a,l)

In the situation of the lovers "cradled gently on the wing I of the conmvmg

from us, for a radiant smile / they dimly glimpse on the rim of other skies!"362
[J68a,8]

On the desecration of the clouds : "Wandering a wasteland at high noon / . . . I
saw a dismal stormcloud bearing down / upon my head, bristling witll vicious
imps"363_this is a conception that could stem directly from a print by Meryon.
[J69,1]


It is rare in French poetry that the big city is evoked through nothing but the
immediate presentation of its inhabitants. This occurs with unsurpassable power
in Shelley's poem on London <cited in MlS). (Wasn't Shelley's London more
populous than the Paris of Baudelaire?) In Baudelaire, one encounters merely
traces of a sinlliar perception-though a good many traces. In few of his poems,
however, is the metropolis portrayed so exclusively in terms of what it makes of
its inhabitants as in "Spleen !:' This poem shows in a veiled way how the soulless
masses of the big city and the hopelessly depleted existence of individuals come
to complement one another. The first is represented by the cemetery and the
suburbs-mass assemblages of citizens ; the second, by the jack of hearts and the
queen of spades.                                                            [J69,2]

The hopeless decrepitude of ti,e big city is felt particularly keenly in the first
stanza of "Spleen 1:'                                                       [J6 9,3]

In ti,e opening poem of Les Fleurs du mal, Baudelaire accosts the public in a most
unusual fashion. He cozies up to them, if not exactly in a cozy vein. You could say
he gathers his readers about him like a camarilla.                          [J69,4]

The awareness of time's empty passage and the taedium vitae are the two weights
tlmt keep the wheels of melancholy going. In this regard, the last poem of the
"Spleen et ideal" sequence corresponds exactly to the sequence "La Mort!'
[J69,S]

The poem "J.]Horloge" <The Clock> takes the allegorical treatment quite far.
Grouped about the clock, which occupies a special position in the hierarchy of
emblems, are Pleasure, the Now, Time, Chance, Virtue, and Repentance. (On
the sylphid, compare the "wretched theater" in "I1Irreparable," 3G4 and on the inn,
the auberge in the same poem.)                                              [J69,6]

The "grotesque and livid sky" of "Horreur syrnpathique"365 is the sky ofMeryon.
[J69,7]

On the "sectioning of time;' and on " l]Horloge" in particular, Poe's "Colloquy of
Monos and Una" : "There seemed to have sprung up in the brain that of which
no words could convey to the merely human intelligence even an indistinct
conception. Let me tenn it a mental pendulous pulsation. It was the moral
embodiment of man's abstract idea of Time. . . By its aid I measured the irregu­
.



larities of the clock upon the mantel, and of the watches of the attendants. Their
tickings came sonorously to my ears. The slightest deviation from the tme pro­
portion . . . affected me just as violations of abstract truth are wont, on earth, to
affect the moral sense" (Edgar Allan Poe, Nouvelles His/aires extraordinaires <Pal�s,
1886>, pp. 336-337) .366 This description is nothing but one great euphemism for
the utter void of time to which man is surrendered in spleen.                [J69a,1]

". . . until light / voluptuously reaches for / the horizon, consoling all- / even
hunger, concealing all- / even shame" ("La Fin de la joumee"l""'-this is the
summer lightling of social conflicts in the light sky of the metropolis.     [J69a,2]


" You seem, for setting off' my darkness, more / mockingly to magnify the space I
which hars me from those blue immensities" ("" Je t'adore a regal . . . ") . Juxta­
pose: "And the human face-which Ovid thought was made to mirror the sta1's­
see it now, no longer expressing anything but a crazy ferocity, or rigid in a kind of
death!" (Oeu.vres, vol. 2, p. 628 ["Fusees," no. 3])."""                     [J69a,3]

In studying the allegorical in the work of Baudelaire, it would be a mistake to
undervalue the medieval element in relation to the Baroque. It is something
difficult to describe, but may be grasped most readily if we recall how very much
certain passages, certain poems ("Vers pour Ie portrait de M. Honore Daumier,"
"L:Avertisseur;' "Le Squelette Laboureur"), in their pregnant simplicity, contrast
with others ti,at are overburdened with meanings. This bareness gives them the
sort of expression one finds in portraits by Fouquet.                        [J69a,4]

A Blanquist look at the terrestrial globe: "I contemplate from on high the globe in
its rondure, / and I no longer seek there the shelter of a hut" ("Le COllt du
neant") .36, The poet has made his dwelling in space itself, one could say-or in the
abyss.                                                                       [J69a,5]

Representations pass before the melancholic slowly, as in a procession. This
image, typical in this complex of symptoms, is rare in Baudelaire. It occurs in
"Horreur sympathique" : "your vast mourning clouds / are the hearses of illy
dreams:" 70                                                                   [J70,1]

"Then all at once the raging bells break loose, / hurling to heaven their awful
caterwaul" ("Spleen IV") .'l7l The sky that is assailed by the bells is the same in
which Blanqui's speculations move.                                            [J70,2]

"Behind the scenes, the frivolous decors / of all existence, deep in the abyss, /
I see distinctiy other, brighter worlds" ("La Voix"). Tbese are ti,e worlds of
L'Etemififpar ieJ astreJ. Compare "Le Gouffre" <The Abyss>: "my windows open
on Infinity."'"                                                                [J70,3]


If we bring together "L:Irremediable" with the poem Mouquet attributed to
Baudelaire, "Un Jour de pluie" <A Rainy Day>, then it becomes quite clear that
what inspires Baudelaire is the state of surrender to the abyss, and we see also just
where this abyss actually opens. The Seine localizes "UnJour de pluie" in Paris.
Of this locale we read: "In a fog heavy with poisonous vapors, / men are buried
like sneaking reptiles; / though proud of their strength, they stumble blindly
along / more painfully with each step" (vol. 1 , p. 212). In "L:Irremediable;' this
image of the Parisian streets has become one of the allegorical visions of the abyss
which the conclusion of the poen1 describes as " apt emblems" : "A soul in t0f111ent
descending / . . . into an echoing cavern / . . . of vigilant slimy monsters / whose
luminous eyes enforce / the gloom" (vol. 1 , pp. 92-93) .373                   [J70,4]


Apropos of the catalogue of emblems presented by the poem �'L? Irremediable:\
Crepet cites a passage from de Maistre's Soirees de Saint-Pi�tersbourg: " That river
which one crosses hut once; that pitcher of the Danaicles, always full and always
empty; that liver of Tityus, alwa.ys regenerated uncleI' the beak of the vulture that
always devours it anew, . . . -these are so many speaking hieroglyphs, about
which it is impossible to he mistaken. "374                                   [J70,5]

('Benediction" presents the poet's path in life as Passion: ('he sings the very
stations of his cross;' In places, the poem distantly recalls the fantasy in which
Apollinaire, in Le Poete assasJine (ch. 16), has imagined the extermination of poets
by unbridled philistines: "and blinding flashes of his intellect I keep him from
noticing the angry mob;''''                                                   [J70a,2]

Comparison of eyes to illuminated shopwindows: �'Your eyes, lit up like shops to

Concerning "La Servante au grand coeur": the words, "of whom you were so

extremely characteristic. (Remark of Pierre Leyris.)                        [.J70a,!O]

The sadistic imagination tends toward mechanical constmctions. It may be that,
when he speaks of the "nameless elegance of the human armature;' Baudelaire
sees in the skeleton a kind of machinery. The point is made more clearly in "Le
Yin de I'assassin": "That bunch! They feel about as much / as plowshares break­
ing ground- / plow or harrow! Which of them / has ever known Tme Love:'
And, unequivocally: "Blind and deaf machine, fertile in cmelties" ("Tu mettrais
l'univers").38'                                                                [J71,!]

"Old-fashioned" and "immemorial" are still united in Baudelaire. The <things>
that have gone out of fashion have beCOlne inexhaustible containers of memo­
lies. It is thus the old women appear in Baudelaire's poetry ("Les Petites
Vieilles"); thus the departed years ("Recueillement"); it is thus the poet compares
himself to a "stale boudoir where old-fashioned clothes / lie scattered among
wilted fern and rose" ("Spleen II").'8'                                        [J71,2]

Sadism and fetishism intertwine in those imaginations that seek to atmex all
organic life to the sphere of the inorganic. "0 living matter, henceforth you're no
more / Than a cold stone encompassed by vague fear / And by the desert, and
the mist and sun" ("Spleen II")."86 The assimilation of the living to dead matter
was likewise a preoccupation of F1aubert's. The visions of his Saint Anthony are
a triumph of fetishism, and worthy of those celebrated by Bosch on the Lisbon
al_                                                                            [.J71,3]
If "Le Cn'puscule du matin" opens with the sound of reveille in the barrack
squares, one must remember that under Napoleon III, for reasons easy to under­
stand, the interior of the city was filled with barracks.                    [J7l,4]

Smile and sob, as cloud formation of the human face, are an unsurpassable
manifestation of its spirituality.                                           [J7l,S]

In "R�ve parisien;' the forces of production are seemingly brought to a standstill,
put out of commission. The landscape of this dream is the dazzling mirage of the
leaden and desolate terrain that in "De Profundis clamavi" becomes the universe.
"A frozen sun hangs overhead six months; I the other six, the earth is in its
shroud- / no trees, no water, not one creature here, / a wasteland naked as the
polar north!"38?                                                             [J71,6]

The phantasmagoria of "R�ve parisien" recalls that of the world exhibitions,
where the bourgeoisie cried out to the order of property and production their
"Ahide, you are so fair!"'·8                                                 [J7l,7]

"And which, on those golden evenings when you.!eelyourse!lrevive"390-the second
half of the line collapses on itself. Prosodically, it works to contradict what it
affirms. This is, for Baudelaire, a characteristic procedure.               [J7la,2]

"Whose name is known only to the buried prompter"391-this comes from the
world of Poe (compare "Remords posthume;' "Le Mortjoyeux").                 [J7la,3]

The only place in Le Fleurs du mal where the Baudelairean view of children is
contravened is the fifth stanza of the first section of "Les Petites Vieilles": "the
eyes of a child, a little girl who laughs I in sacred wonder at whatever shines!""""
To arrive at this outlook on childhood, the poet takes the longest way-the way
leading through old age.                                                    [J7la,4]

In Baudelaire's work, poems 99 and 100 of Les Fleurs du mal stand apart-as
strange and solitary as the great stone gods of Easter Island. We know that they
belong to the oldest parts of the text; Baudelaire himself pointed them out to his
mother as poems referring to her, poems to which he had given no title because
any advertisement of this secret connection was odious to him. W hat these
poems mark out is a death-tranced idyll. Both, but especially the first, breathe an
air of peace such as rarely obtains in Baudelaire. Botll present the unage of the
fatherless family; the son, however, far from occupy ing the place of the father,
leaves it empty. The distant sun that is setting Ul the first poem is the symbol of
the father, of him whose gaze-"huge open eye in the curious sky"''''-lingers
without jealousy, sympathetic and remote, on the meal shared by mother and
son. The second poem evokes the image of the fatherless family situated not
around a table but around a grave. The sultriness of life pregnant with possibili­
ties has entirely yielded to the cool night air of death.                     [J7la,S]

TIle "Tableaux parisiens" begin with a transfiguration of the city. The first,
second, and, if you like, third poem of the cycle work together in this. "Paysage"
is the city's t�te-a-t�te with the sky. The only elements of the city to appear on the
poet's horizon are the "workshop full of singing and gossip, and the chinmey­
pots and steeples.""<' Then "Le Soleil" adds the suburbs; nothing of the urban
masses enters into the first three poems of "Tableaux parisiens." The fourth
begins with an evocation of the Louvre, but it passes immediately, in the middle
of the second stanza, into lamentation over the perishability of the great city.

We may be surprised to find the poem "Brumes et pluies"among "Tableaux
parisiens:' It verges on imagery of the country. But already Sainte-Beuve had
written: "Oh, how sad the plain around the boulevard!" ("La Plaine, octobre;'
mentioned by Baudelaire conlre Sainte-Beuve on January 15, 1866).397 The land­
scape of Baudelaire's poem is, in fact, that of the city plunged in fog. It is the
preferred canvas for the embroideries of boredom.                              [J72,4]

"Le Cygne" <The Swam has the movement of a cradle rocking back ,md forth
between lllodemity and antiquity. In his notes, Baudelaire writes: "Conceive a
sketcl1 for a lyrical or fairy bouJfOnnerie, a pantomime . .. .Steep the whole in an
abnormal, dreamy atmosphere-the atmosphere of greal days. Let there be some­
thing lulling about it" ("Fusees," no. 22) .398 These great days are the days of
recurrence.                                                                    [J72,5]

The opposite poles of the Baudelairean sensibility find their symbols equally in

America's spirit world enters into the description of the crowd in Poe. Marx
speaks of the republic which in Europe "signifies, in general, only the political
form of revolution of bourgeois society and not its conservative form of life-as,
for example, in the United States of North America, where . .. classes ...have
not yet become fixed, ... where the modern means of production . . . compen­
sate for the relative deficiency of heads and hands, and where, finally, the fever­
ish, youthful movement of material production . . . has left neither time nor
opportunity for abolishing the old spirit world:' Marx, Der achtzehnte Brunzaire,
p.30.4111 It is remarkable that Marx invokes the world of spirits to help explain the
American republic.                                                            [J73,4]

Sainte-Beuve's relnark about Lamartine, whose poems represented the sky over
Andre Chenier's landscapes (J51a,3) , should be compared with the words of
Marx: "While, in its accord with society, in its dependence on natural forces and
its submission to the authority which protected it from above, the small holding
that had newly come into being was naturally religious, the small holding that is
ruined by debts, at odds with society and authority, and driven beyond its own
limitations naturally becomes irreligious.I-Ieaven was quite a pleasing accession
to the narrow strip of land just won, more particularly as it makes the weather; it
becomes an insult as soon as it is thrust forward as substitute for the small
holding:' Marx, Der achtzehnte Brunzaire, p. 122:'" Sainte-Beuve's analogy, com-
bined with this passage from Marx, provides the key to the character and dura­

Ambiguity of the heroic in the figure of the poet: the poet has about him some­

Ambiguity of that conception of the heroic which is hidden in the Baudelairean
image of the poet. "The cuhrrinating point of the idees napolioniennes is the pre­
ponderance of the army.The army was the point d'honneur of the small-holding
peasants; it was they themselves transformed into heroes....But the enemies
against whom the French peasant has now to defend his property are ...the tax
collectors.The small holding lies no longer in the so-called fatherland, but in the
register of mortgages.The army itself is no longer the flower of the peasant
youth; it is the swamp-flower of the peasant lumpenproletariat.It consists in large
measure of remplw;ants, of substitutes, just as the second Bonaparte is himself
only a   remplafant, the substitute for Napoleon. .. . One see that ALL idees
napolioniennes are ideas of the undeveloped small holding in the freshness of its
youth; for the small holding that has outlived its day, they are an absurdity:'

like manner, after the coup d'etat, the French bourgeoisie cried: Only the chief of
the Society of December 10 can still save bourgeois society! Only theft can still save
property! Only perjury can save religion! Only bastardy can save the family! Only
disorder can save order!" Marx, Der achtzehnte Brumaire, ed. Rjazanov,

The "magic cobbles piled for barricades;' in Baudelaire's draft of an epilogue;'"

In the last section of "Salon de 1846" (section 18, "De I'Heroisme de la vie
moderne"), suicide appears, characteristically, as a "particular passion"-the
only one, among those mentioned, of any real significance. It represents the great
conquest of modernity in the reaIm of passion: "Except for Hercules on Mount
Oeta, Cato of Utica, and Cleopatra, . . . what suicides do you see in the paintings
of the old masters?" Ch. B., OeuvreJ, vol. 2, pp. 133-134.119Suicide appears, then,
as the quintessence of modernity.                                           [J74a,2]

In section 17 of "Salon de 1846," Baudelaire speaks of ""the funereal and rumpled

flesh, have their own mysterious grace?" (p. 134). Ch. B . , Oeu·vres, vol. 2. 420

Nietzsche on the winter of 1882-1883, on the Bay of Rapallo: ��Mornings, I would
walk in a southerly direction on the splendid road to Zoagli, going up past pines
with a magnificent view of the sea; in the afternoon, . . . I walked around the whole
bay . . . all the way to Portofino. This place and this scenery came even closer to
my heart because of the great love that Emperor Frederick III felt for them. . . . It
was on these two walks that the whole of Zarathustra I occurred to me, and
especially Zarathustra himself as a type. Rather, he overtook me." Friedrich
Nietzsche, Also Sprach Zarathustra, ed. Kroner (Leipzig), pp. xx-xxi. Compare
this with a description of the Fort du Taureau. m                             [J74a,4]

Against the hackground of his "philosophy of the noontide"-the doctrine of
eternal recunence-Nietzsche defines the earlier stages of his thinking as philoso­
phy of the dawn and philosophy of the morning. He, too, knows the "sectioning
of time" and its great divisions. It is certainly legitimate to ask whether this
apperception of time waS not an element of Jugendstil. If in fact it was, then we
would perhaps better understand how, in Ibsen, Jugendstil produced one of the
greatest technicians of the drama.                                         [J74a, 5]

The closer work comes to prostitution, the more tenlpting it is to conceive of
prostitution as work-something that has been customary in the argot of whores
for a long time now. Tills rapprochement has advanced by giant steps in the
wake of unerIlployment; the "Keep smiling"m maintains, on the job market, the
practice of the prostitute who, on the love market, fal shes a smile at dle customer.
[J75,1]

The description of the labor process in its relation to nature will necessarily bear
the imprint of its social structure as well. If the human being were not authentically
exploited, we would be spared the inauthentic talk of an exploitation of nature.
This talk reinforces the semblance of "value;' which accrues to raw materials
only by virtue of an order of production founded on the exploitation of hnman
labor. Were this exploitation to come to a halt, work, in turn, could no longer be
characterized as d,e exploitation of nature by man. It would henceforth be con­
ducted on the model of children's play, which in Fourier forms the basis of the
"mpassioned work" of the Harmonians. To have instituted play as the canon of
a labor no longer rooted in exploitation is one of the great merits of Fourier. Such
work inspirited by play aims not at the propagation of values but at the anleliora­
tion of nature. For it, too, the Fourierist utopia furnishes a model, of a sort to be
found realized in the games of children. It is the mage of an earth on which every
place has become an inn. The double meaning of the word < Wirtschaft> blossoms
here: all places are worked by human hands, made useful and beautiful thereby;
all, however, stand, like a roadside inn, open to all . An earth that was cultivated
according to such an mage would cease to be part of "a world where action is
never d,e sister of dream.""23 On that earth, the act would be kin to the dream.
[]7 5,2 ]

Fashion determines, in each case, the acceptable linut of empathy.            []75,3]

The unfolding of work in play presupposes highly developed forces of produc­
tion, such as only today stand at the disposal of humanity, and stand mobilized in
a direction contrary to their possibilities-that is, they are poised for an emer­
gency. Nevertheless, even in tmes of relatively undeveloped productivity, the
murderous idea of the exploitation of nature, which has ruled over things since
the nineteenth century, was in no sense detenninative. Certainly dUs idea could
have no place so long as the prevailing mage of nature was that of the minister­
ing mother, as reflected in Bachofen's conception of matriarchal societies. In the
figure of the mother, dUs inlage has survived the inconstancies of history, though
it obviously has grown more blurred during d,ose periods in which mothers
themselves become agents of the class that risks the life of their sons for its
commercial interests. There is much to suggest that the second marriage of
Baudelaire's mother was not madc any more bearable for him by the fact that she
elected to marry a general. This marriage evidendy has a share in d,e evolution
of the poet's libido; if the whore became the mastering image of the latter, this
ll1arriage plays its part. Of course, the whore is, fundamentally, the incarnation of
a nature suffused with commodity appearance. She has even intensified its power
of delusion insofar as, in commerce with her, an always fictive pleasure arises,
one that is supposed to corresond to the pleasure of her partner. In other words,
the capacity for pleasure itself now figures as a value in dUs commerce-as the
object of an exploitation perpetrated no less by her than by her partner. On the
other hand, one sees here the distorted, more than life-size mage of an availabil­
ity that holds for everyone and is discouraged by none. The unworldly ecstatic
lasciviousness of the Baroque poet Lohenstein has stamped dus mage in a man­
ner that is highly renriniscent of Baudelaire: "A beautiful woman, yes, arrayed in
a thousand splendors, / Is a sumptuous table where the many sup and take their
fill, / An inexhaustible wellspring of never failing waters, / Yes, of love's sweet
milk; and from a hundred conduits / cThe luscious nectar runs" (Daniel Caspers
von Lohenstein, Agrippina [Leipzig, 1724], p. 33). The "beyond" of the choice
governing relations between mother and child, and the here and now of the
choice governing relations between prostitute and client, make contact at a single
point. This point defines the situation of Baudelaire's libido. (Compare X2,1:
Marx on prostitution.)                                                        [J75a]


The lines from "Selige Sehnsucht"-"No distance can weigh you dowu, / You
come flying, fascinated"424-describe the experience of the aura.The distance that
is there in the eyes of the beloved and that draws the lover after it is the dream of
a better nature. The decline of the aura and the waning of the dream of a better
nature-this latter conditioned on its defensive position in the class struggle-are
one and the same. It follows that the decline of the aura and the decline of sexual
potency are also, at bottom, one.                                             [J76, 1 ]


The formula of L'Etemite par les astres-"The new i s always old, and the old

A passage from L'Eternitepar les astres-"The number of our doubles is infinite
in time and space .... These doubles exist in flesh and bone-indeed, in trousers
and jacket, in crinoline and chignon"-may be compared with "Les Sept Vieil­
lards":

Doubtless to you my dread seems ludicrous,
unless a brotherly shudder lets you see:
for all their imminent decrepitude,
these seven monsters had eternal life!

I doubt if! could have survived an eighth
such apparition, father and son of himself,
inexorable Phoenix, loathsome avatar!
-I turned my back on the whole danmed parade.

Lamartine's industrial Christ reappears at the eud of the cenmry. Thus Ver­

And baptizes it in the fire of newborn stars.m

Baudelaire was not possessed of any such optimism-and that was the great
chance for his presentation of Paris. Cited inJules Destree, "Der Zug nach der

In the historical action which the proletariat brings against the bourgeois class,
Baudelaire is a witness; but Blanqui is an expert witness.                [J76a,1]


If Baudelaire is summoned before the tribunal of history, he will have to put up
with a great many interruptions; an interest that is in many respects foreign to
binl, and in many respects incomprehensible to him, conditions the line of ques­
tioning. Blanqui, on the other hand, has long since made the question on which
he speaks entirely his own; hence, he appears as an expert where this question is
tried. It is therefore not exacdy in the same capacity that Baudelaire and Blanqui
are cited to appear before the tribunal of history. (Compare Nll,3.)       [J76a,2]


Abandomnent of the epic moment: a tribunal is no sewing circle. Or better: the

TIle interest which the materialist historian takes in the past is always, in part, a
vital interest in its being past-in its having ceased to exist, its being essentially
dead. To have certified this condition with respect to the whole is the indispensa­
ble prerequisite for any citation (any calling to life) of particular parts of this
phenomenon of what-has-been. In a word: for the specifci historical interest
whose legitinmcy it is up to the materialist historian to establish, it must be shown
that one is dealing with an object which in its entirety, acmally and irrevocably,
"belongs to history:'                                                          [J76a,4]


The comparison widl Dante can serve both as an example of the perplexity of
the early reception of Baudelaire and as an illustration of Joseph de Maistre's
remark that the earliest judgments concerning an author are bequeathed to the
subsequent criticism. <SeeJ64a,4.>                                     [J76a,5]


In addition to ilie Dante comparison, ilie concept of decadence figures as a key­
word in the reception. It is iliere in Barbey d'Aurevilly, Pontruartin, Bmnetiere,
Bourget.                                                                  [J76a,6]
For the materialist dialectician, discontinuity is the regulative idea of the tradition
of the ruling classes (and therefore, primarily, of the bourgeoisie); continuity, the
regulative idea of the tradition of the oppressed (and therefore, primarily, of the
proletariat). The proletariat lives more slowly than the bourgeois class. The
examples of its champions, the perceptions of its leaders, do not grow old, or, at
any rate, they grow old much more slowly than the epochs and great personages
of the bourgeois class. The waves of fashion break against the compact mass of
the downtrodden. The movements of the ruling class, by contrast, having once
come into their ascendancy, maintain in themselves a reference to fashion. In
particular, the ideologies of the rulers are by their nature more changeable than
the ideas of the oppressed. For not only must they, like the ideas of the latter,
adapt each time to the situation of social conflict, but they must glorify that
situation as fundamentally harmortious. Such a business is managed only eccen­
trically and desultorily; it is modish in the fullest sense of the word. To undertake
to "salvage" the great figures of the bourgeoisie means, not least, to conceive
them in this most unstable dimension of their operation, and precisely from out
of that to extract, to cite, what has remained inconspicuously buried beneath­
being, as it was, of so little help to the powerful. To bring together Baudelaire and
Blanqui means removing the bushel that is covering the light:""                 [J77,1]


Baudelaire's reception by poets can be easily distinguished from his reception by
theorists. The latter adhere to the comparison with Dante and the concept of
decadence; the former, to the maxim of art for art's sake and the theory of
correspondences.                                                                [J77,2]

1'11e hero who asserts himself on the stage of modernity is, in fact, an actor first of

The figure of the poet in "Benediction" is a figure from Jugendstil. The poet
appears, so to speak, in the nude. He displays the physiognomy of Joseph
Delorme.                                                              [J77a,4]

The "natural benevolence" which Magnin (J50a,4) celebrates in Sainte-Beuve­

It can be seen from the portraits that Baudelaire's physiognomy very early
showed the marks of old age. Among other things, this accounts for the oft-noted
resemblance between his features and those of prelates.                  [J77a,6]

Valles was perhaps the first to complain insistently (as Souday would do later)

Allegory recognizes many enigmas, but it knows no mystery. An enigma is a
fragment that, together with another, matching fragment, makes up a whole.
Mystery, on the other hand, was invoked from time inuuemorial in the image of
the veil, which is an old accomplice of distance. Distance appears veiled. Now,
the painting of the Baroque-unlike that of the Renaissance, for example-has
nothing at all to do with this veil. Indeed, it ostentatiously rends the veil and, as
its ceiling frescoes in particular demonstrate, brings even the distance of the skies
into a nearness, one that seeks to startle and confound. This suggests that the
degree of auratic saturation of human perception has fluctuated widely in the
course of history. (In the Baroque, one might say, the conflict between cult value
and exhibition value was variously played out within the confines of sacred art
itself.) While these fluctuations await further clarification, the supposition arises
that epochs which tend toward allegorical expression will have experienced a
crisis of the aura.                                                           [J77a,S]

Allegorical dismemberment. The music to which one listens under the influence

During the Baroque, a formerly incidental component of allegory, the emblem,
undergoes extravagant development. If, for tl,e materialist historian, the medie­
val origin of allegory still needs elucidation, Marx himself furnishes a clue for
understanding its Baroque form.He writes in Das Kapital (Hamburg, 1922), vol.
1, p.344: "The collective machine ...becomes more and more perfect, the more
the process as a whole becomes a continuous one-that is, the less the raw
material is interrupted in its passage from its first phase to its last; in other words,
the more its passage from one phase to another is effected not only by the hand
of man but by the machinery itself.In manufacture, the isolation of each detail
process is a condition imposed by the nature of division of labor, but in the fully
developed factory the continuity of those processes is, on the contrary, impera­
tive." ."" Here may be found the key to the Baroque procedure whereby meanings
are conferred on the set of fragments, on the pieces into which not so much the
whole as the process of its production has disintegrated. Baroque emblems may
be conceived as half-finished products which, from the phases of a production
processl have been converted into monuments to the process of destruction.
During the Tbirty Years' War, which, now at one point and now at another,
inll10bilized production, the "intenuption " that, according to Marx, charac­
terizes each particular stage of this labor process could be protracted almost
indefinitely. But the real triumph of the Baroque emblematic, the chief exhibit of
which becomes the death's head, is the integration of man himself into the
operation. The death's head of Baroque allegory is a half-finished product of
the history of salvation, that process interrupted-so far as this is given him to
realize-by Satan.                                                                [J78,4]


The financial ruin of Baudelaire is the consequence of a quixotic struggle against
the circumstances that, in his day, detennined consumption. Ine individual con­
sumer, who vis-a.-vis the artisan commissions work, figures in the marketplace as
customer. There he does his part in the clearance of a stock of commodities
which his particular wishes have had no influence whatsoever in producing.
Baudelaire wanted to have such particular wishes reflected not only in his choice
of clothing-the tailor's was, of all the branches of business, the one that had to
reckon longest with the consumer who conunissions work-but also in his furni­
ture and in other objects of his daily use. He thus became dependent on an
antiquary who was less than honest, and who procured for him paintings and
antique furniture that in some cases proved to be fakes. The debts which he
incurred through these dealings weighed on hun for the rest of his life.        [J78a,l]


In the final analysis, the image of' petrified unrest called up by allegory is a
historical image. It shows the forces of antiquity and of Christianity suddenly
arrested in their contest, turned to stone amid unallayed hostilities.In his poem
on the sick muse, with its masterful verse that hetrays nothing of the chimerical
nature of the poet's wish, Baudelaire has devised, as ideal image of the muse's
health, what is really a formula for her distress: "I'd wish     .   . ./ Your Christian
blood to flow in waves that scan / W ith varied sounds of ancient syllables;'434
[J78a,2]
In the poetry of Baudelaire, notwithstanding the new and original signature
which allegory inscribes there, a medieval substrate makes itself felt beneath d,e

It would be an error to think of the experience contained in the correspondances as
a simple counterpart to certain experiments with synesthesia (with hearing colors
or seeing sounds) that have been conducted in psychologists' laboratories. In
Baudelaire's case, it is a matter less of the well-known reactions, about which
effete or snobbish art criticism has made such a fuss, than of the medium in
which such reactions occur. Tills medium is d,e memory, and with Baudelaire it
was possessed of unusual density. The corresponding sensory data correspond in
it; they are teeming with memories, which run so thick that they seem to have
arisen not from this life at all but from some more spacious vie anlirieure. It is this
prior existence that is intimated by the "familiar eyes""38 with which such experi­
ences scrutinize the one who has them.                                          [179,6]


What fundamentally distinguishes the brooder from the thinker is that the for­

great problem but then has forgotten it. And now he broods-not so much over
the matter itself as over his past reflections on it. The brooder's thinking, there­
fore, bears the inlprint of memory. Brooder and allegorist are cut from the same
cloth.                                                                         [179a,l]

Baudelaire is quite as isolated in the literary world of his day as Blanqui is in the

With the increase in displays of merchandise and with the rise, in particular, of
magasins de nouveautis, the physiognomy of the commodity emerged more and
more distioctly. Of course, even with his sensitive receptivity, Baudelaire never
would have registered this development had it not passed like a magnet over the
"precious metal of our will;'440 over the iron are of his imagination.In fact, the
ruling figure of that imagination-allegory-corresponded perfectly to the com­
modity fetish.                                                            [J79a,4]

The uncovering of the mechanical aspects of the organism is a persistent ten­
dency of the sadist. One can say that the sadist is bent on replacing the human
organism with the image of machinery. Sade is the offspring of an age that was
enraptured by automatons. And La Mettrie's "man machine" alluded to the
guillotine, which fumished rudimentary proof of its truths.In his bloody-minded
fantasies, Joseph de Maistre-Baudelaire's authority on matters political-is
cousin to the marquis de Sade.                                             [JSO,!]

The brooder's memory ranges over the indiscriminate mass of dead lore.Human
knowledge, within this memory, is something piecemeal-in an especially preg­
nant sense: it is like the jumble of arbitrarily cut pieces from which a puzzle is
assembled. An epoch fundanlentally averse to brooding has nonetheless pre­
served its outward gesture in the puzzle. It is the gesture, in particular, of the
allegorist. Through the disorderly fund which his knowledge places at his dis­
posal, the alIegorist rummages here and there for a particular piece, holds it next
to some other piece, and tests to see if they fit together-that meaning with this
image or this image with that meaning.The result can never be known before­
hand, for there is no natural mediation between the two. But this is just how
matters stand with commodity and price.The "metaphysical subtleties" in which
the commodity delights, according to Marx>,," are, above all, the subtleties of
price formation. How the price of goods in each case is arrived at can never quite
be foreseen, neither in the course of their production nor later when they enter
the market. It is exactly the same with the object in its allegorical existence. At no
point is it written in the stars that the alIegorist's profundity will lead it to one
meaning rather than another. And though it once may have acquired such a
meaning, this can always be withdrawn in favor of a different meaning. The
modes of meaning fluctuate almost as rapidly as the price of commodities. In fact,
the meaning of the commodity is its price; it has, as commodity, no other mean­
ing. Hence, tl,e allegorist is in his element with commercial wares. As flilneur, he
has empathized with the soul of the commodity; as allegorist, he recognizes in the
"price tag;' with which the merchandise comes on the market, the object of his
broodings-the meaning. The world in which this newest meaning lets him settle
has grown no friendlier. An inferno rages in the soul of the commodity, for all the
seeming tranquillity lent it by the price.                              [J80,2; J80a,1J

On the flight of images in allegory. It often cheated Baudelaire out of part of the
returns on his allegorical imagery. One thing in particular is missing in Baude·
laire's employment of allegory. This we can recognize if we call to mind Shelley's
great allegory on the city of London: the third part of "Peter Bell the Third;' in
which London is presented to the reader as hell. <See M18.> The incisive effect of
this poem depends, for the most part, on the fact that Shelley's grasp of allegory
makes itself felt. It is this grasp that is missing in Baudelaire. This grasp, which
makes palpable the distance of the modem poet from allegory, is precisely what
enables allegory to incorporate into itself the most immediate realities. With what
directness that can happen is best shown by Shelley's poem, in which bailiffs,
parliamentarians, stockjobbers, and many other types figure. The allegory, in its
emphatically antique character, gives them all a sure footing, such as, for exam·
pIe, the businessmen in Baudelaire's "Crepuscule du soir" do not have.-Shelley
rules over the allegory, whereas Baudelaire is ruled by it.                   [JS! ,6]

Individuality, as such, takes on heroic outlines as the masses step more decisively
into the picture. This is the origin of the conception of the hero in Baudelaire. In
Hugo, it is a matter not of the isolated individual as such but of the democratic
citizen. That implies a fundamental difference between the two poets. The resolu·
tion of this discord would have, as precondition, the dispelling of the illusion
<Schein> which it reflects. This illusory appearance comes from the concept of the
masses. Considered apart from the various classes which join in its formation,
the mass as such has no primary social significance. Its secondary significance
depends on the ensemble of relations through which it is constituted at any one
time and place. A theater audience, an army, the population of a city comprise
masses which in themselves helong to no particular class. The free market multi·
plies these masses, rapidly and on a colossal scale, insofar as each piece of
merchandise now gathers around it the mass of its potential buyers. TIle totalitar­
ian states have taken this mass as their model. The         Volksgemeinschqfl <People's
Community> aims to root out from single individuals everything that stands in
the way of their wholesale fusion into a mass of consumers. The one implacable
adversary still confronting the state, which in this ravenous action becomes the
agent of monopoly capital, is the revolutionary proletariat. This latter dispels the
illusion of the mass through the reality of class. Neither Hugo nor Baudelaire
could be directly at its side for that.                                        [J81a,!]

On the inauguration of the heroine: Baudelaire's antiquity is Roman antiquity. At
only one point-and it is, of course, irreplaceable-does Greek antiquity break
into his world. Greece presents him with that image of the heroine which ap­
peared to him worthy and capable of being carried over into modernity. Greek
names stand at the head <?> of one of his greatest poems: "Femmes danmees:
Delphine et Hippolyte." The heroine <is endowed> with the features of lesbian

imitated, to have reproduced, with his work this state of affairs, one of the most
profane of all in the commodity economy. Perhaps this is Baudelaire's greatest

Being reduced to rags is a specific form of poverty-by no means the superlative
form. "Poverty takes on the peculiar character of raggedness when it occurs

from this system, fragments isolated from all context, it becomes subject to needs

Lotze's reflections on the worker who no longer handles a tool but operates a

participation of the individual in the work of the macrune, by contrast, is limited
to . . . manual operations wruch bring forth notbing directly but merely supply to
an inscrutable mechanism the obscure occasion for invisible accomplishments:'

allegories, which in turn suddenly wither like flowers. Sternberger has touched
on this state of affairs (Panorama <Hamburg, 1938>, p. 66): "the allegory that has
become a semblance of life, that has given up its lastingness and its rigorous

On "Les Sept Vieillards:' The very fact that this poem stands isolated within
Baudelaire's oeuvre fortifies the assumption that it occupies a key position there.
If this position has remained UlIDoticed until now, this may have to do with the
fact that a purely philological commentary has missed the mark with this poem.
Yet the relevant datum is not so far afield. The piece corresponds with a particu­
lar passage from Les Paradis artijiciels. It is this passage, however, that can shed
light on the philosophical import of the poem.                                []84,4]

The following passage from Les Paradis artijiciels is decisive for "Les Sept Vieil­

Comparison between Blanqui and Baudelaire, in part deriving from Brecht's
formulations: the defeat of Blanqui was the victory of Baudelaire-of the petty

enemy within. Baudelaire appears as a comic figure-as the cock whose triumphal

over, is the ending, which makes the exhibition of the aura from now on an affair

On the dance of death (compare 1(7a,3, the passage from Huxley): "'The woodcuts
with which the Parisian printer Guyot Marchant ornamented the first edition of
the Danse Macabre in 1485 were, very probably, imitated from the most cele­
brated of these painted death dances-namely, that which, since 1424, covered the
walls of the eloister of the cemetery of the Innocents in Paris . . . . The dancing
person whom we see coming back forty tunes to lead away the living originally
represents not Death itself but a corpse: the living man such as he will presently
��
be. In the stanzas, the dancer is called "'the dead man" or "the dead woman. It is
a dance of the dead and not of Death . . . . It is only toward the end of the century
that the figure of the great dancer, of a corpse wit.h hollow and fleshless hody,
becomes a skeleton, as Holbein depicts it." J. Huizinga, Herbst des Mittelalters

On "the metaphysics of the agent provocateur" : ""Without being too prejudiced in
the matter, one may still feel a little uneasy in reading Les Mysteres galans [Les
Mysteres galans des theatres de Paris ]47 1 to think that Baudelaire had a hand in
this. If he himself has disowned this piece of youthful extravagance, there are
nonetheless good reasons for believing, with M . Crepet, that he is in fact one of the
authors. Here then is a Baudelaire on the brink of blackmail, spiteful toward all
success? This would suggest that throughout his career, from these Mysteres to the
Amoenitates Belgicae, the great poet had need, from time to time, of voiding a sac
of venom." Jean Prevost, review of the work mentioned, La Nouvelle Revue

In an important passage by de Maistre, we not only encounter allegory in its
satanic provenance, and in the very perspective that would later be that of Baude­
laire; we also discover-here invested with the mysticism of Saint-Martin or
Swedenborg-the correspondances. And these latter constitute, revealingly, the
antidote to allegory. The passage is found in the eighth of Les Soirees de Saint­
Pitersbourg, and reads: "One can form a perfectly adequate idea of the universe
by considering it under the aspect of a vast museum of natural history exposed to
the shock of an earthquake. The door to the collection rooms is open and
broken; there are no more windows. Whole drawers have fallen out, while others
hang by their hinges, ready to drop. Some shells have rolled out into the hall of
minerals, and a hummingbird's nest is resting on the head of a crocodile. What
madman, though, could have any doubt of the original intention, or believe that
the edifice was built to look this way? . . . The order is as visible as the disorder;
and the eye that ranges over this mighty temple of nature reestablishes without
difficulty all that a fatal agency has shattered, warped, soiled, and displaced. And
there is more: look closely and you can recognize already the effects of a restoring
hand. Some beams have been shored up, some paths cut through the rubble;
and, in the general confusion, a multitude of analogues have already taken their
place once again and come into contactC'0!72                                    [J86,2]

Concerning Baudelaire's "�Voyage it Cythere":

But always the hlue sky above.

The theory of poetry as faculty of expression-"Where other men must suffer
grief in silence, / A god gave me the power to speak my pain"473-is formulated
with particular decisiveness by Lamartine in the "first" (it is actually the second)
preface to his Miditations of 1849. The "striving for originality at all costs;' to say
nothing of an authentic reflection on original possibilities, preserves the poet­
Baudelaire above all-frOlll a poetics of mere expression. Lamartine writes: " 1
imitated no one; I expressed myself for myself. There was no art in this, but only
an easing of my own heart. . . . I took no thought of anyone in putting down
these lines here and there, unless it was of a ghost and of God:' Les Grands

Apropos of Lafargue's remark about the "crude comparisons" in Baudelaire
(J9,4), Ruff observes: "The originality of these comparisons is not so much in
their 'crudity' as in the artificial character-which is to say, human character-of
dle iroages: wall, lid, the wings of a stage. The 'correspondence' is understood in
a sense opposite to that customarily proposed by the poets, who lead us back to
nature. Baudelaire, by an invincible propensity, recalls us to the idea of the
human. Even on the human plane, if he wishes to magnify his description by an
image, he will often look for some oilier manifestation of humanity railier than
having recourse to nature: 'the chimney-pots and steeples, the city's masts. "'474

Extracts from the preface which Pyat wrote for the 1884 edition of Le Chiffonnier
de PariJ <The Ragpicker of Paris>.These statements are important as indirect
evidence of the connections that exist between Baudelaire's oeuvre and radical
socialism."This painful but salubrious drama .., has merely carried through the
logical evolution of my thinking, in advance of ... the same evolution in the
people ....It is republican thinking in my first play, Vile Revolution d autrifOis <A
Revolution of Old>; republican·democratic in Ango, Ie marin <Ango, the Sailor>;
democratic and social in LeJ Deux Serrun'ers <The Two Locksmiths>, DiogeneJ,
and Le Chiffonniet; but it is always a progressivist thinking tending toward the
ideal, toward ...completion of the work of '89 ....There is nO doubt that
national unity has been attained ...and political unity as well ... ! But social
unity remains unachieved.There are still two classes having little in common but
the air they breathe ...; notlling can unite them but mutual respect and love.
How many wealthy French men many poor French women? The CnIX lies
there....Let us come back to Jean ....I conceived tllis drama in prison, to
which I had been conderrmed in 1844 for having avenged the republic on tlle
monarchy.Yes, it is a product of imprisomnent, like those other popular protesta­
tions Don Qyixote and RobinJon CruJoe; Jean has at least that in common with
these immortal masterpieces. I conceived it the evening of the performance of its
elder sibling DiogeneJ, which was produced while I was behind bars.By a very
direct filiation of ideas, tlle Cynic suggested to me the Ragpicker; the lantern of
philosophy suggested the candle of the pal�ah; the tub suggested the wicker
basket; the disinterestedness of Athens suggested the zeal of Paris.Jean was the
Diogenes of Paris, as Diogenes was theJean of Athens.The natural inclination of
my mind and spirit led me to the people; I anl drawn to the cause of the masses.
My poetic practice, ever in harmony with my politics, has not once separated tlle
author from the citizen.Art, in my opinion, ...
-not art for art's sake, but art for
the sake of humazlity-should ...gravitate toward the people.In fact, art follows
what is sovereign, c0I111l1cncing with the gods, continuing with kings, nobles, and
bourgeoisie, and ending with the people. And the initiative for that end, in Les
Serruriers, had to reach its basic principle, its very center of gravity, in Le Chiffon­
nier. For while bourgeois art . . . displayed its radiance in Hernani, Ruy BIas, and
other lovers of queens, . . . republican art . . . was announcing another dynasty,
that of the ragpickers . . . . On February 24, 1848, at noon, after the victory over
the monarchy of Louis Philippe, the drama of 'rags and tatters' was performed
gratis before the armed and triumphant populace. It was duriug tlns memorable
performance that the actor . . . recovered the crown in the basket. What a historic
day! What an indescribable effect! Author, actors, director, and spectators, all
standing together and clapping their hands to the singing of La Marseillaise, to
the sound of cannon. . . . I have spoken of the birth and the life ofJean. As for his
death:Jean was crushed, like the Republic, beneath the landslide of December.""
The play had the honor of being condemned together with its author, who had
seen it applauded in London, in Brussels, everywhere except Paris. Thus, in a
society based on the family-and at a time when . . . the rights of incest, in Rene,
the rights of adultery, in Antony, the rights of the brothel, in Rolla, all enjoyed an
open field-Jean, representing the rights of the family, was proscribed by the
saviors of family and society;' Felix Pyat, Le Chiffonnier de Paris, drama in five

It would appear that Baudelaire has given no thought to the classical corso of
fl&nerie-the arcade. But in tl,e lyric design of "Le Crepuscule du matin;' which
concludes "Tableaux parisiens;' the canon of the arcade can be recognized. The
central portion of tllls poem is composed of nine couplets which, while chiming
one with another, remain well sealed off from the preceding as well as the follow­
ing pairs of lines. The reader moves through tllls poem as through a gallery lined
with showcases. In each one, the inmlaculate inlage of naked misery is on display.
The poem closes with two quatrains that, in their presentation of tllings earthly
and celestial, match each other like pilasters.                                [J88a,2]

restricted his action to a series of fruitless sorties and to an acceptance of long
imprisonment. He knew himself condemned to a purely preparatory and symbolic
existence, to an attitude of patience with the gloom and fetters . And his whole life
was spent in this state of mind. He became, in time, a wan and emaciated old man.
But he will never be conquered. He cannot be conquered." Jean Cassou, Qu,ur­

Regarding a connection that may be felt between Baudelaire's "generosity of
heart" and rus sadism, one should refer to Proust's portrait of Mlle. Vmteuil
(which, by the way, was probably conceived as a self-portrait) : '''Sadists' of Mlle.
Vinteuil's sort are creatures so purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that
even sensual pleasure appears to them as somethiog bad, a privilege reserved for
the wicked. And when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it, they
endeavor to iropersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of wicked peo-

illusiou of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and scrupulous
natures into the inhuman world of pleasure:' Marcel Proust, Du COte de chez
Swann, voL 1 , p, 236,4"'-One might also think here of Anatole France's note on
the Baudelairean erotic, Yet one is justified in asking whether every sadism is
structured like this one, since the concept of evil to which Proust relates it seems
to exclude awareness. Sexual intercourse between human partners (in contrast to
that between animals) includes awareness, and would thus perhaps also include a
more or less high degree of sadism, Baudelaire's reflections on the sexual act
would therefore carry more weight than this Proustian apologetic,              [J89a,3]

In Baudelaire's theory of art, the motif of shock comes into play not only as
prosodic principle. Rather, this same motif is operative wherever Baudelaire
appropriates Poe's theory concerning the importance of surprise in the work of
art.-From another perspective, the motif of shock emerges in the "scornful
laughter of hell"488 which rouses the startled allegorist from his brooding.

would have seen. Hello writes: '"In the symbolic order, beauty stands in inverse
proportion to life. The naturalist thus classifies nature HS follows: animal kingdom
first, vegetable kingdom next, mineral ldngdom last. He is guided by the order of
life. The poet will say: mineral kingdom first, vegetable kingdom after that, and
animal kingdom last. He will be guided by tbe order of beauty."           [J90,4]

Apropos of " L'Horloge," Crepet (Conard, p. 450): '"A correspondent for L 'Inter­

the hands from his clock and written on the face: 'It's later than you think!'"

On novelty and the familiar: "One of my dreams was the synthesis . . . of a certain
seagirt place and its medieval past. . . . This dream in which . . . the sea had
turned gothic, this dream in which . . . I believed that I was attaining to the impos-
sible-it seemed to me that I had often dreamed it before. But as it is the property
of what we imagine in our sleep to multiply itself in the past, and to appear, even
when novel, familiar, I supposed that I was mistaken." Marcel Proust, La Cote de
Guermantes (Paris, 1920), vol. 1, p. 131.49 1                                  [J90a,2]

A rigorously Baudelairean reminiscence in Proust, to which, above all , the com­
ments on Meryon <in "Salon de 1859") should be compared. Proust speal<s of
railroad stations as "those vast, glass-roofed sheds, like that of Saint-Lazare into
which I must go to find the train for Balbec, and which extended over the rent
bowels of the city one of those bleal< and boundless skies, heavy with an accumu­
lation of dramatic menaces, like certain skies painted with an almost Parisian
modernity by Mantegna or Veronese, beneath which could be accomplished
only some solemn and tremendous act, such as a departure by train or the
Elevation of the Cross;' Marcel Proust, A I'Ombre desjeunesjilles enjieurs (paris) ,
vol. 2, p. 63 492                                                             [J90a,3]

The stanza beginning " If rape and arson," from 'IoAu Lecteur," is cited by Proust
« La Prisonniere (Paris, 1923), vol. 2> p. 241) with this characteristic addition:
" But I can at least assume that Baudelaire is not sincere. Whereas Dosto­
evsky . . . " At issue is the latter's " preoccupation with murder." This all in a
conversation with Albertine.49.�                                           [J90a,4J

Apropos of " A Vne Passante" : "When Albertine returned to my room, she was
wearing a garment of black satin which had the effect of making her seem paler, of
turning her into the pallid, ardent Parisian, etiolated by want of fresh air, by the
atmosphere of crowds and perhaps by habitual vice, whose eyes seemed more
restless because they were not brightened by any color in her cheeks." Marcel
Pronst, La Prison"i.re (Paris, 1923), vol. 1 , p . 138:194                  [J90a,5]

Meryon shows himself equal to the competition provided by photography. It was
probably the last time this was possible for a graphic artist, as far as the inlage of
the city is concerned. Writing about medieval Paris, Stahl says that on the site of
the ancient curia "arose buildings that were much too large, against which the
houses abutted with one yard after another, . . . and with blind alleys. Photogra­
phy is useless here. Hence, we turn to the engravings of the great draftsman
Meryon;' Fritz Stahl, Paris (Berlin <1929» , p. 97.                           [J91,1]

Insight into the physiognomy of "overpopulated Paris" is afforded by the back­
ground-empty of human beings-in Meryon's Pont au change. On this back­
ground we meet with one or two very narrow (window-wide) and, as it were,
spindly houses. Tbeir window openings strike the viewer like gazes; they bring
to mind the gazes of those spindly, hollow-eyed children who appear-often
gathered together in great numbers-in pictures of poor people from that era,
and who stand there abashed and close-packed in a corner like the tenements in
Meryon's engraving.                                                           [J91 ,2]

Baudelaire, great despiser of the countryside, of greenery and fields, nevertheless

Baudelaire had the good fortune to be the contemporary of a bourgeoisie that
could not yet employ, as accomplice of its domination, such an asocial type as he

In the introduction to his published translation of one of Poe's tales in L'Illustra­
tion (April 17, 1852), Baudelaire characterizes the American author's field of
interests, and mentions, among other things, Poe's " analysis of the eccentrics and
pariahs of this world" (Ch<arles> B<audelaire>, Oeuvres completes, ed. Crepet, Ii'a­
ductions: Nouvelles Histoires extraordinaires [paris, 1933], p. 378):'97 The phrase
corresponds, in the most striking mannel; to the self-portrait which Blanqui
introduced-as rebus image, so to speak-into L'Eterniti par les astres: "Blanqui
. . . recognized himself to be 'the pariah' of an epoch." Maurice Dommanget,

It is only as commodity that the thing has the effect of alienating human beings
from one anothel: It produces this effect through its price. What is decisive is the
empathy with the exchange value of the commodity, with its equalizing sub­

Regarding spleen. Blanqui to Lacambre, September 16, 1853: " Even the news

more wretched than this shut-away existence, this tossing and turning at the bot­

Awakening as a graduated process that goes on in the life of the individual as in
the life of generations . Sleep its initial stage . A generation's experience of youth
has much in common with the experience of dreams . Its historical configuration
is a dream con figuration . Every epoch has such a side turned toward dreams , the
child's side. For the previous century, this appears very dearly in the arcades . But
whereas the education of earlier generations explained these dreams for them in
terms of tradition , ofreligious doctrine, present-day education simply amounts to
the distraction of children . Proust could emerge as an unprecedented phenome­
non only in a generation that had lost all bodily and natural aids to remem­
brance' and that, poorer than before, was left to itself to take possession of the
worlds of childhood in merely an isolated , scattered , and pathological way. What
follows here is an experiment in the technique o f awakening. An attempt to be­
come aware o f the dialectical-the Copernican-tum of remembrance .               [Kl, 1]


The Copernican revolution in historical perception is as follows . Formerly it was
thought that a fixed point had been found in "what has been;' and one saw the
present engaged in tentatively concentrating the forces of knowledge on this
ground . Now this relation is to be over turned , and what has been is to become
the dialectical reversal-the flash of awakened consciousness . Politics attains
primacy over history. The facts become something that just now first happened
to us, first stmck us; to establish them is the affair of memory. Indeed, awaken­
ing is the great exemplar of memory: the occasion on which it is given us to
remember what is closest, tritest, most obvious. What Proust intends with the
experinlental rearrangement of furniture in matinal half-slumber, what Bloch
recognizes as the darkness of the lived moment,' is nothing other than what here
is to be secured on the level of the historical, and collectively. There is a not-yet­
conscious knowledge of what has been: its advancement' has the structure of
awakening.                                                                     [Kl,2]

There is a wholly unique experience of dialectic. The compelling-the drastic­
experience, which refutes everything "gradual" about becoming and shows all
seerning "development" to be dialectical reversal, eminently and thoroughly
composed, is the awakening from dream. For the dialectical schematism at the
core of this process, the Chinese have often found, in their fairy tales and novel­
las, a highly pregnant expression. The new, dialectical method of doing history
presents itself as the art of experiencing the present as waking world, a world to
which that dream we name the past refers in tTIlth. To pass through and carry out
what has been in remembering the dream!-Therefore: remembering and awak­
ing are most intimately related. Awakening is nanlely the dialectical, Copernican
turn of remembrance.                                                         [Kl,3]

The nineteenth century a spacetime <Zeitraum> (a dreamtime <Zeit-traum» in
which the individual consciousness more and more secures itself in reflecting,
while the collective consciousness sinks into ever deeper sleep. But just as the
sleeper-in this respect like the madman-sets out on the macrocosmic journey
through his own body, and the noises and feelings of his insides, such as blood
pressure, intestinal churn, heartbeat, and muscle sensation (which for the waking
and salubrious individual converge in a steady surge of health) generate, in the
extravagantly heightened limer awareness of the sleeper, illusion or dream inl­
agery which translates and accounts for them, so likewise for the dreanring col­
lective, which, through the arcades, conmmnes with its own insides. We must fol­
low in its wake so as to expound the nineteenth century-in fashion and advertis­
ing, in buildings and politics-as the outcome of its dream visions.         [Kl,4]

It is one of the tacit suppositions of psychoanalysis that the clear-cut antithesis of
sleeping and waking has no value for determining the empirical form of con­
sciousness of the human being, but instead yields before an unending variety of
concrete states of consciousness conditioned by every conceivable level of wake­
fulness within all possible centers. The situation of consciousness as patterned
and checkered by sleep and waking need only be transferred from the individual
to the collective. Of course, much that is external to the former is internal to the
latter: architecture, fashion-yes, even the weather-are, in the interior of the
collective, what the sensoria of organs, the feeling of sickness or health, are inside
the individual. And so long as they preserve this unconscious, amorphous dream
configuration, they are as much natural processes as digestion, breathing, and the
like. They stand in the cycle of the eternally selfsame, until the collective seizes
upon them in politics and history emerges.                                       [KI,S]

Ine fact that we were children during this time belongs together with its objec­
tive image. It had to be this way in order to produce this generation. That is to
say: we seek a teleological moment in the context of dreams. Which is the
moment of waiting. The dream waits secretly for the awakening; the sleeper
surrenders himself to death only provisionally, waits for the second when he will
cunningly wrest himself from its clutches. So, too, the dreaming collective, whose
children provide the happy occasion for its own awakening. 0 Method 0

Task of childhood: to bring the new world into symbolic space. The child, in fact,
can do what the grownup absolutely cannot: recognize the new once again. For
us, locomotives already have symbolic character because we met with them in
childhood. Our children, however, will find this in automobiles, of which we
ourselves see only the new, elegant, modern, cheeky side. There is no more
insipid and shabby antithesis than that which reactionary thinkers like Klages try
to set up between the symbol-space of nature and that of technology. To each
truly new configuration of nature-and, at bottom, technology is just such a
configuration-there correspond new "images!' Every childhood discovers these
new Images in order to incorporate them into the image stock of humanity.

It is remarkable that constructions in which the expert recognizes anticipations of
contemporary building fashions impress the alert but architecturally unschooled
sense not at all as anticipatory but as distinctly old-fashioned and dreamlike. (Old

" The nineteenth century: singular fusion of individualistic and collectivist tenden­
cies. Unlike virtually every previous age, it labels all actions �individualistic' (ego,
nation, art) while subterraneanly, in despised everyday domains, it necessarily
furnishes, as in a delirium, the elements for a collective formation . . . . With this
raw material, we must occupy ourselves-with gray buildings, market halls, de­
partment stores, exhibitions." Sigfried Giedion, Bauen in Frankreich (Leipzig
and Berlin), p. 15.                                                             [KIa,S]
It is not only that the forms of appearance taken by the dream collective in the
nineteenth century cannot be thought away; and not only that these forms char­
acterize tills collective much more decisively than any other-they are also,
rightly interpreted, of the highest practical import, for they allow us to recognize
the sea on which we navigate and the shore from which we push off. It is here,
therefore, that the "critique" of the nineteenth cennIry-to say it in one word­
ought to begin. The critique not of its mechanism and cult of machinery but of its
narcotic historicism, its passion for masks, in which nevertheless lurks a signal of
true historical existence, one which the Surrealists were the first to pick up. To
decipher tills signal is the concern of the present undertaking. And the revolu­
tionary materialist basis of Surrealism is sufficient warrant for the fact that, in tills
signal of true historical existence, the nineteenth Cenl'llry gave supreme expres­
sion to its economic basis.                                                     [Kla,6]

Attempt to develop Giedion's thesis. "In the nineteenth century;' he writes,
"construction plays the role of the subconscious;'; Wouldn't it be better to say

"Strange, by the way, that when we survey this whole intellectual movement,
Scribe appears as the only one to occupy himself directly and thoroughly with the
present. Everyone else busies himself more with the past than with the powers and
interests that set their own time in motion . . . . It was the past, moreover-it was
the history of philosophy-that fueled eclectic doctrine; and, finally, it was the

incapable of entering more deeply into the literary life of its own period." Julius

It is said tl,at the dialectical method consists in doing justice each time to the
concrete historical situation of its object. But that is not enough. For it is just as
much a matter of doing justice to the concrete historical sintation of the interest
taken in the object. And this sintation is always so constituted that the interest is
itself preformed in that object and, above all, feels tills object concretized in itself
and upraised from its former being into the higher concretion of now-being
<]etztseim (waking being!). In what way this now-being (which is sometlllng other
than the now�being of "the present time" <]etztzeit>, since it is a being punctuated
and intermittent) already signifies, in itself, a higher concretion-this question, of
course, can be entertained by the dialectical method only within the purview of a
historical perception that at all points has overcome the ideology of progress. In
regard to such a perception, one could speak of the increasing concentration
(integration) of reality, such that everything past (in its time) can acquire a higher
grade of actuality than it had in the moment of its existing. How it marks itself as
higher actuality is determined by the image as which and in which it is compre­
hended. And this dialectical penetration and actualization of former contexts
puts the truth of all present action to the test. Or rather, it serves to ignite the
explosive materials that are latent in what has been (the authentic figure of which
isfoJhion) . To approach, in this way, "what has been" means to treat it not histo­
riographically, as heretofore, but politically, in political categories. 0 Fashion D

On the doctrioe of the ideological superstructure. It seems, at first sight, that
Marx wanted to establish here only a causal relation between superstructure and
infrastructure. But already the observation that ideologies of the superstructure
reflect conditions falsely and invidiously goes beyond this. Tne question, in
effect, is the following: if the infrastructure in a certain way (in the materials of
thought and experience) determines the superstructure, but if such detemlina­
tion is not reducible to simple reflection, how is it then-entirely apart from any
question about the originating cause-to be characterized? AB its expression. The
superstructure is the expression of the infrastructure. The econolIllc conditions
under which society exists are expressed in the superstructure-precisely as, with
the sleeper, an overfull stomach finds not its reflection but its expression in the
contents of dreams, which, from a causal point of view, it may be said to "condi­
tion." The collective, from the first, expresses the conditions of its life. These [md

thing! The head is here under the scaffold, and it believes that it still exists above,
fonning part of the body and continuing to wait for the blow that will separate it
from the trunk:' A. Wiertz, Oeuvres litteraires (Paris, 1870), p. 492. 111e same
inspiration at work here in Wiertz aninlates Bierce in his extraordinary short
story about the rebel who is hanged, and who experiences, at the moment of his
death, the flight that frees him from the hangman. "                             [K2a,2]

Every current of fashion or of worldview derives its force from what is forgotten.
This downstream flow is ordinarily so strong that only the group can give itself
up to it; the individual-the precursor-is liable to collapse in the face of such
violence, as happened with Proust. In other words: what Proust, as an individual,
directly experienced in the phenomenon of remembrance, we have to experience
indirectly (with regard to the nineteenth century) in studying "current;' "fash­
ion;' "tendency" -as punishment, if you will, for the sluggishness which keeps
us from taking it up ourselves. '                                          [K2a,3]

Fashion, like architecture, inheres in the darkness of the lived moment, belongs
to the dream consciousness of the collective. The latter awakes, for example, in
advertising.                                                              [K2a,4]

""Very interesting . . . how the fascistization of science had to alter precisely those

Historical index of childhood according to Marx. In his derivation of the norma­
tive character of Greek art (as an art springing from the childhood of the human
race), Marx says: "Doesn't the child in every epoch represent the character of the
period in its natural veracity?'" Cited in Max Raphael, Proud1lOn, Marx, Picasso
(paris, 1933), p. 175.                                                     [K2a,6]
More than a hundred years before it was fully manifest, the colossal acceleration
of the tempo of living was heralded in the tempo of production. And, indeed, in
the form of the machine. "The number ofimplements that he himself [that is, the
human being] can use simultaneously is limited by the number of his own natural
instruments of production, by the number of his bodily organs. . . . The jenny, on
the other hand, even at its very birth, spun with twelve to eighteen spindles, and
the stocking loom knits with many thousands of needles at once. The number of
tools that a machine can bring into play simultaneously is, from the very first,
emancipated from the organic limits that hedge in the tools of a handicraftsman:'
Karl Marx, Das Kapital, vol. 1 (Hamburg, 1922), p. 33Z to The tempo of machine
operation effects changes in the economic tempo. "In this country, the main thing
is to reap a huge fortune with as little delay as possible. It used to be that the
fortune resulting from a commercial house begun by the grandfather was
scarcely run through by the tinle the grandson died. Things don't happen that
way any more; people want to enjoy without waiting, without having to be
patient:' Louis Rainier Lanfranchi, Voyage a Pam, ou Esquisses des hommes et des
choses dans cetle capitale (Paris, 1830), p. 1 10.                          [K3,l]

Simultaneity, the basis of the new style of living, likewise comes from mechanical
production: "Each detail machine supplies raw material to the machine next in
order; and since they are alI working at the same time, the product is always
going through the various stages of its fabrication, and is also constantly in a state
of transition from one phase to another. . . . The collective machine, now an
organized system of various kinds of single machines, and of groups of siugle
machines, becomes more and more perfect, the more the process as a whole
becomes a continuous one-that is, the less the raw material is interrupted in its
passage from its first phase to its last; in other words, the more its passage from
one phase to another is effected not by the hand of man but by the machinery
itself. In manufacture the isolation of each detail process is a condition imposed
by the nature of division of labor, but in the fully developed factory the continu­
ity of those processes is, ou the contrary, imperative:' Karl Marx, Das Kapital,
vol. 1 (Hamburg, 1922), p. 344."                                               [K3,2]

A small piece of materialist analysis, more valuable than most of what exists in
this field: "We love these hard, solid blocks of material which F1aubert raises and
lets fall with the intermittent thud of a steam shovel. For if, as I found recounted
in some book or other, sailors at sea used to catch the glow ofF1aubert's lamp as
he worked through the night, and take their bearings from it, as if from a light­
house beam, so too it might be said that when he 'unloaded' a good round
phrase, it had the regular rhythm of one of those machines used in excavating.
Happy are they who can feel the beat of this obsessive rhythm." Marcel Proust,
Chroniques (Paris, 1927), p. 204 (''A Propos du 'style' de F1aubert") ."      [K3,4]

In his chapter on the fetish character of the commodity, Marx has shown how
ambiguous the economic world of capitalism seems. It is an ambiguity consider­
ably heightened by the intensification of capital management-as we see exem­
plified quite clearly in the machines which aggravate exploitation rather than
alleviate the human lot. Isn't there implicit here a general connection to the
equivocalness of the phenomena we are dealing with in the nineteenth century?
The significance of intoxication for perception, of fiction for thinking, such as
was never before recognized? "One thing has disappeared in the general up­
heaval, and it was a great loss for art: the naive and therefore dependable accord
oflife and appearance"-so we read, characteristically, inJulius Meyer's Geschichte
der modernen.franziisischen Malerei seit 1 789 (Leipzig, 1867), p. 3 1 .      [K3,5]

On the political significance of film. Socialism would never have entered the
world if its proponents had sought only to excite the enthusiasm of the working
classes for a better order of things. What made for the power and authority of the
movernent was that Marx understood how to interest the workers in a social
order which would both benefit them and appear to them as just. It is exactly the
same with art. At no point in time, no matter how utopian, will anyone win the
nlasses over to a higher art; they can be won over only to one nearer to them.
And the difficulty consists precisely in finding a form for art such that, with the
best conscience in the world, One could hold that it is a higher art. This will never
happen with most of what is propagated by the avant-garde of the bourgeoisie.
Here, Berl's argument is perfectly correct: "The confusion over the word 'revolu­
tion' -a word which, for a Leninist, signifies the acquisition of power by the
proletariat, and which elsewhere signifies ti,e overturning of recognized spiritual
values-is sufficiently attested by the Surrealists in their desire to establish Pi­
casso as a revolutionary. . . . Picasso deceives them. . . . A painter is not more
revolutionary for having 'revolutionized' painting than a tailor like Poiret is for
having 'revolutionized' fashion, or than a doctor is for having 'revolutionized'
medicine;' Emmanuel Ber!, "Prernier pamphlet;' Europe, 75 (1929), p. 401. The
masses positively require from the work of art (which, for them, has its place in
the circle of consumer items) something that is warming. Here the flame most
readily kindled is that of hatred. Its heat, however, burns or sears without provid­
ing the "heart's ease" which qualifies art for consumption. Kitsch, on the other
hand, is nothing more than art with a 100 percent, absolute and instantaneous
availability for consumption. Precisely within the consecrated forms of expres­
sion, therefore, kitsch and art stand irreconcilably opposed. But for developing,
living forms, what matters is that they have witllin them something stirring,
useful, ultinlately hearteillng-that they take "kitsch" dialectically up into them­
selves, and hence bring themselves near to the masses while yet surmounting the
kitsch. Today, perhaps, film alone is equal to this task-or, at any rate, more ready
for it than any otl,er art form. And whoever has recogrlized this will be inclined
to disallow the pretentions of abstract film, as important as its experiments may
be. He will call for a closed season on-a natural preserve for-the sort of kitsch
whose providential site is the cinema. Only film can detonate the explosive stuff
which the nineteenth century has accumulated in that strange and perhaps for­
merly unknown material which is kitsch. But just as with the political structure of
film, so also with other distinctively modern means of expression (such as light­
ing or plastic design) : abstraction can be dangerous.                            [K3a, l]

One can characterize the problem of the form of the new art straight on: When
and how will the worlds of form which, without our assistance, have arisen, for
example, in mechanics, in filnl, in 11lachine construction, in the new physics, and
which have subjugated us, make it clear for us what manner of nature they
contain? When will we reach a state of society in which these forms, or those
arising frolll thenl, reveal themselves to us as natural fonns? Of course, this
brings to light only one moment in the dialectical essence of technology. ( Which
moment, is hard to say: antithesis if not synthesis.) In any case, there lives in
technology another impulse as well: to bring about objectives strange to nature,
along with means that are alien and inimical to nature-measures that emanci­
pate themselves from nature and master it.                                        [K3a,2]

Confrontation hetween the "'visceral unconscious" and the "'unconscious of obliv­

collective: "The other part of' the unconscious is made up of' the mass of' things

conscious once and which, by diffusion, have entered oblivion . . . . Vast subma­
rine fund, in which all cultures, all studies, all proceedings of mind and will, all
social uprisings, all struggles are collected in a formless mire . . . . The passional
elements of individuals have receded, dimmed. All that remain are the givens of
the external world, more or less transformed and digested. It is of the external
world t.hat this unconscious is made . . . . Born of social life, this humus belongs to
soeieties . The species and the individual count for little ill it; only the raees and the
ages leave their marle This enormous labor undertaken in the shadows comes to
light in dreams, thoughts, decisions, and above all at moments of crisis or of social
upheaval; it forms the great common ground, the reserve of peoples and individu-
also Revolution and war, like a fever, are hest suited to get it moving. . . . Seeing
that the psychology of the individual is now outmoded, let us call upon a sort of
natural history of volcanic rhythms and suhterranean streams. There is nothing

�'The works of' M. Haussmann gave rise, at least in the beginning, to a host of
rather strange or grandiose projects . . . . For example, the architect M. Herard
published, in 1855, a proposal for building footbridges at the intersection of the
Boulevard Saint-Denis and the Boulevard de Sebastopol; these footbridges, incor­
porating galleries, would make for a continuous square, each side of which would
be defined by the angle formed at the crossing of the two boulevards. M. J . Brame,
in 1856, exhibited a series of lithographs detailing his plan for a metropolitan
railway line-in Paris, specifically-with a system of arches supporting the rails,
with walkways on the side for pedestrians, and with elevated crossovers to connect
these sidewalks . . . . At around the same time, in a ��Letter to the Minister of
Commerce," a lawyer called for the establishment of' a series of awnings running
the length of the streets to shelter the pedestrian, . . . who would have no further
need of a carriage or umbrella. Not long after this, an architect . . . proposed to
reconstruct the entire historic city center in Gothic style, so as to bring it into

On the dream house: ·I,In all southern countries, where the popular conception of
the street requires that the exteriors of houses appear more 'lived in' t.han their
interiors, this exhihition of the private life of the residents confers on t.heir dwell­
ings the quality of a secret place, which piques the curiosity of foreigners. The
impression made is the same in fairs: everyt.hing t.here is consigned t.o thc strect.

Con(�erning the interior of the body: " The motif and its elaboration go back to
John Chrysostom's 'On Women and Beauty' (Opera, ed. B. de Montfaucon
[Paris, 1735], vol. 12, p. 523)." "The beauty of the body is merely skin-deep. For
if, like the legendary lynx of Boeotia, men were to see what lies beneath the skin,
they would recoil in disgust at the sight of a woman. That. well-known charm is
nothing but mucus and blood, humors and bile. Just stop to consider what is
hidden away in the nostrils , the throat, or the belly: everywhere filth. And if, in
fact, we shrink from touching mucus or dung with even the tip of our fInger, how
(�ould we ever wish to embrace the sack of excrements itself?" Odon of Cluny,

He the psychoanalytic theory of memory: "Freud's later researches made it clear
that this view [the concept of repression] must he enlarged . . . . The machinery of
repression . . . is . . . a special case of the . . . signifieant process which occurs
when the ego is unequal to meeting certain demands made upon the mental meeha­
nism. The more general process of defense does not cancel the strong impressions;
it only lays them aside . . . . It. will he in the interest of clarity for me to state the
contrast between memory and reminiscence with delilJerate bluntness: the func­
tion of memory [the aut.hor identifies the sphere of " forgetfulness" wit.h " uncon­
scious memory" (p. 130)] is to protect our impressions; reminiscence aims at their
dissolution. Essentially nW1nory is conservative; reminiscence, destructive. "

"For instance, we experience the death of a near relative . . . and believe that we
feel our grief in all its depth . . . , but our griefreveals its depths only long after we
think that we have got the better of it;' The "forgotten" grief persists and gains
ground; compare tbe death of the grandmotber in Proust. "To experience means
to rnaster an impression inwardly that was so strong we could not grasp it at
once." 'Tuis definition of experience in Freud's sense is something very different
from what is meant by those who speak of having "had an experience." Theodor

What is laid aside in the unconscious as content of memory. Proust speaks of the
"thoroughly alive and creative sleep of the unconscious . . . in which the things
that barely touch us succeed in carving an impression, in which our hands take
hold of the key that turns the lock, the key for which we have sought in vain:'

The classic passage on "involuntary lllcmory" in Proust-prelude to the moment
in which the effect of the madeleine on the narrator is described: "And so it was
that, for a long time afterward, when I lay awake at night and revived old
memories of Combray, I saw no more of it than this sort ofJuminous panel. . . . I
must own that I could have assured any questioner that Combray did include
other scenes . . . . But since the facts which I should then have recalled would
have been prompted only by the voluntary memory, the intellectual memory,
and since the information which that kind of memory gives us about the past
preserves nothing of the past itself, I should never have had any wish to ponder
over this residue of Combray. . . . And so it is with our own past. It is a labor in
vain to attempt to recapture it: all the efforts of our intellect must prove futile.
The past is hidden somewhere outside the realm, beyond the reach, of intellect,
in some material object . . . which we do not suspect. And as for that object, it
depends on chance whether we come upon it or not before we ourselves must
die." Marcel Proust, Du COte de chez Swann, vol. 1, pp. 67-69.'"             [K8a,l]

The classic passage on awakening at night in a dark room and the ensuing
orientation: "When I awoke like this, and my mind struggled in an unsuccessful
attempt to discover where I was, everything would be moving round me through
the darkness: things, places, years. My body, still too heavy with sleep to move,
would make an effort to construe the form which its tiredness took as an orienta­
tion of its various members, so as to deduce from that where the wall lay and the
furniture stood, to piece together and to give a name to the house in whicll it
must be living. Its memory, the composite memory of its ribs, knees, and shoul·
der-blades, offered it a whole series of rooms in which it had at one time or
another slept, while the unseen walls kept changing, adapting themselves to the
shape of each successive room that it remembered, whirling madly through the
darkness. And even b efore my brain . . . had collected sufficient impressions . . .
to identify the room, it, my body, would recall from each room in succession
what the bed was like, where the doors were, how daylight came in at the
windows, whether there was a passage outside, what I had in my mind when I
went to sleep, and had found there when I awoke:' Marcel Proust, Du Coli de
chez Swann, vol. 1, p. 15.27                                                 [K8a,2]

Proust on nights of deep sleep after great exhaustion: "Good nights . . . turn so
effectively the soil and break through the surface stone of our body that we
discover there, where our muscles dive down and throw out their twisted roots
and breathe the air of the new life, the garden in which as a child we used to play.
There is no need to travel in order to see it again; we must dig down inwardly to
discover it. What once covered the earth is no longer upon it but beneath; a mere
excursion does not suffice for a visit to the dead city-excavation is necessary
also." These words run counter to the injunction to revisit the sites of one's
childhood. And they lose not a whit of their sense when taken as a critique of the
memoire volonta£,.e. Marcel Proust, Le Cote de Guermantes (Paris, 1920), vol. 1,
p. 82.28                                                                         [K9,1]


Linking of Proust's oeuvre to the work of Baudelaire: "One of the masterpieces
of French literature-Sylvie, by Gerard de Nerval-like the Memoires d'outre­
tombe <of Chateaubriand> . . . , contains a sensation of the same character as the
savor of the madeleine. . . . And finally, in Baudelaire, these reminiscences are still
more frequent and obviously less incidental and therefore, in my opinion, deci­
sive. Here it is the poet hinlself who, with more variety and more indolence,
purposely seeks in the odor of a woman's hair or her breast, for example, inspir­
ing resemblances whim shall evoke for him 'the canopy of overarching sky' and
'a harbor filled with masts and sails.' I was going to endeavor to recall the poems
of Baudelaire which are based in similar manner on a transferred sensation, in
order definitely to place myself again in line with such a noble literary heritage
and reassure myself that the work I was now about to undertake without any
further hesitation was worth the effort I was going to devote to it, when I reached
the foot of the stairs . . . and suddenly found myself . . . in the midst of a mte."

Dream city of Napoleon I: '''Napoleon, who originally had wanted to erect the Arc
de Triomphe somewhere inside the city, like the disappointing first effort made at
the Place du Caroussel, let himself be persuaded by Fontaine to start construction
west of the city, where a large tract of land was at his disposal, on an imperial Paris
that would surpass the royal city, Versailles included. Between the summit of the
Avenue des Champs-Elysees and the Seine, . . . on the plateau where today the
Trocadero stands, was to be built, "with palaces for twelve kings and their reti­
nues,' . . . "not only the most beautiful city that ever was, hut the most beautiful
city that ever could he. ' The Arc de Triomphe was conceived as the first edifice of

The genteel variant of the dream house. The entrance to the panorama of
Gropius is described as follows: "One enters a room decorated in the style of
Herculaneum; at its center the passerby is drawn for a moment to a basin inlaid
with shells, in which a small fountain is plashing. Straight ahead, a little flight of
stairs leads to a cheerful reading room where some volumes are displayed-nota­
bly, a collection of books designed to acquaint foreigners with the royal resi­
dence;' Erich Stenger, Daguerres Diorama in Berlin (Berlin, 1925), pp. 24-25.
Bulwer<-Lyttom's novel. W hen did the excavations begin? Foyers of casinos, and
the like, belong to this elegant variant of the dream house. W hy a fountain in a
covered space is conducive to daydreanring has yet to be explained. But in order
to gauge the shudder of dread and exaltation that might have come over the idle
visitor who stepped across this threshold, it must be remembered that the discov­
ery of Pompeii and Herculaneum had taken p1�ce a generation earlie!; and that
tl,e memory of the lava-death of these two cities was covertly but all the more
intimately conjoined witll the memory of the great Revolution. For when the
sudden upheaval had put an end to the style of the ancien regime, what was here
being exhumed was hastily adopted as the style of a glorious republic; and palm

"For our type of man," says Jacques de Lacretelle, "train stations are tnlly facto­
ries of dreams" ("Le Rheur parisien;' Nouvelle Revuefran,aise, 1927). To be sure:
today, in the age of the automobile and airplane, it is only faint, atavistic terrors
whicb still lurk within the blackened sheds; and that stale comedy of farewell and
reunion, carried on before a background of Pullman cars, turns the railway
platform into a provincial stage. Once again we see performed the tinleworn
Greek melodrama: Orpheus, Eurydice, and Hermes at the station. Through the
mountains of luggage surrounding the figure of the nymph, looms the steep and
rocky path, the crypt into which she sinks when the Hermaic conductor with the
signal disk, watching for the moist eye of Orpheus, gives the sign for departure.
Scar of departure, which zigzags, like the crack on a Greek vase, across the

Museums unquestionably belong to the dreanl houses of the collective. In con­
sidering them, one would want to emphasize the dialectic by which they come
into contact, on the one hand, with scientific research and, on the other hand,
with "the dreamy tide of bad taste;' "Nearly every epoch would appear, by virtue
of its inner disposition, to be chiefly engaged in unfolding a specific architectural
problem: for the Gothic age, this is the cathedrals; for the Baroque, the palace;
and for the em·ly nineteenth century, with its regressive tendency to allow itself to
be saturated with the past: the museum:' Sigfried Giedion, Bauen in Frankreich,
p. 36. This tl::lsr t for the past forms something like the principal object of my
analysis-in light of which the inside of the museum appears as an interior
magnified on a giant scale. In the years 1850-1890, exhibitions take the place of
museums. Comparison between the ideological bases of the two.                [Lla,2]

��The nineteenth eentury provided all new creations, in every area of endeavor,
with historicizing masks. This was no less true in the field of architecture than in
the field of industry or society. New possibilities of construction were being intro­
duced, hut people felt almost fear at the advent of these new possibilities and
heedlessly buried them in theatrical decoration. The enormous collective appara­
tus of industry was being put in place, but its significance was altered entirely by
the fact that the benefits of the production process were allowed to accrue to only a
small number. This historicizing mask is indissolubly bound to the image of the
nineteenth century, and is not to be gainsaid." Sigfried Giedion, Bauen in Frank­
reich, Pl'. 1-2.                                                              [Lla,3]

Le Corbusier's work seems to stand at the terminus of the mythological figura­
tion "house:' Compare the following: "Why should the house be made as light
and airy as possible? Because only in that way can a fatal and hereditary monu­
mentality be brought to an end. As long as the play of burden and support,
whether actually or symbolically exaggerated (Baroque) , got its meaning from
the supporting walls, heaviness was justified. But today-with the unburdened
exterior wall-the ornamentally accentuated counterpoint of pillar and load is a
painflIl farce (American skyscrapers)." Giedion, Bauen in Frankreich, p. 85.
[Ll a,4]

Le Corbusier's "contemporary city'" is yet another settlement along a highway.
Only the fact that now its precincts are traveled over by autos, and that airplanes
now land in its midst, changes everything. An effort must be made to secure a
foothold here from which to cast a productive glance, a form-and-distance-creat­
ing glance, on the nineteenth century.                                       [Lla,5]

" The condominium is the last incarnation of the haronial manor. It owes its exist­
ence and its form to the hrutal egoistic competition of individual landowners for
the rights to territory that, in the struggle for existence, was being hroken up and
parceled out. We are therefore not surprised to see the form of the manor house
reappearing as well-in the walled courtyard. One occupant secludes himself from
another, and that in fact helps to explain why, in the end, a chance remnant of the
wholc survives." Adolf Behne, Neues Wohnen-Neues Bauen (Leipzig, 1927),

The museum as dream housc. ""We have seen how the Bourbons alrcady thought it

cultural evolution depicted on the ceilings of the Louvre. �� Julius Meyer,

In June of 1837-"to the everlasting glory of France"-the historic museum of
Versailles was opened. A suite of rooms that one needs almost two hours merely
to traverse. Battles and scenes of parliament. Among the painters: Gosse,
Lariviere, Heim, Deveria, Gerard, Ary Scheffer, and others. Here, then, the
collecting of pictures turns into: the painting of pictures for the museum. [L2,1]

Interlacing of museum and domestic interior. M. Chabrillat (1882, director of' the
Ambigu theater) one day inherits a complete waxworks museum� "set up in the
Passage de POpera. right above the clock.'� (Perhaps it was the old Hartkoff
Museum.) Chabrillat is friends with a certain bohemien, a gifted draftsman, who
at the time is homeless. This man has an idea. Among the waxworks in this mu­
seum is one group representing the visit of Empress Eugenie to cholera patients in
Amiens. At the right, the empress smiles on the patients; to the left is a Sister of
Charity in white cornet; and lying on an iron cot, pale and emaciated beneath the
fine clean bedclothes, is a dying man. The museum closes at midnight. The drafts­
man opines: Nothing simpler than to remove, with due care, the cholera patient,
lay him on the floor, and take his place in the bed. Chabrillat gives his permission;
the wax figures mean little to him. For the next six weeks � then, the artist, having
just heen thrown out of his hotel, spends the night in the bed of the cholera victim,
and each morning he awakens under the gentle glance of the sicknurse and the
smiling glance of the empress, who lets her blond hail' fall on him. From Jules

Think of the arcade as watering place. What we would like is to stumble upon an
arcade myth, with a legendary source at its center-an asphalt wellspring arising

the ground floor of a house to our right. And as we walked on, the ghost
accompanied us from inside all the houses. It passed through all the walls and
always remained at the same height with us. I saw this, though I was blind. The
path we travel through arcades is fundanlentally just such a ghost wall" on which

Description of a wax museum as dream house: "Once visitors reached the fmal
landing, they looked around the corner into a large, brightly lit room. There was,
so to say, no one within, though it was fil ed with princes, crinolines, uniforms, and
giants at the entrance. The woman went no further, and her escort paused beside
her, piqued hy a haleful pleasure. They sat down on the steps, and he told her of
the terror he had experienced as a hoy in reading ahout ill-famed castles where no
one lived any longer, but where on stormy nights there were lights hurning at all
the windows. What was going on inside? What gathering was there? Where was
that light coming from? He had dreamed of catching a glimpse of t.his assembly
while hanging from the window ledge, his face pressed against the windowpanes of
the unspeakahle room." Ernst. Bloch, 44Leib und WachsHgur," Frankfurter Zeit­

" The Opera is one of the characteristic creations of the Second Empire. It was
designed by an unknown young architect, Charles Garnier, whose plan was se­
lected from among 160 projects submitted. His theater, constructed in the years
1861-1875, was conceived as a place of pageantry. . . . It was the stage on which
imperial Paris could gaze at itself with satisfaction. Classes newly risen to power
and to fortune, blendings of cosmopolitan elements-this was a new world, and it
called for a new name: people no longer spokc of the Court, but of Ie Tout Paris <all
fashionable Paris) . . . . A theater conceived as an urban center, a center of social
life-this was a new idea, and a sign of the times." Dubech and d'Espezel, Histoire

On the beginnings of the museum at Versailles: ""M. de Montalivet was in a hurry to
acquire a quantity of paintings. He wanted them everywhere, and, since the
Chambers had decried prodigality, he was determined to buy cheaply. The trend
was toward thrift . . . M. de Montalivet willingly . . . let it be thought that it was he
himself who, on the quays and in the dealers' shops, was buying up third-rate
canvases . . . . No, . . . it was the reigning princes of art who were indulging in this
hideous business . . . The copies and pastiches in the museum at Versailles are the
most grievous confirmation of the rapacity of those master artists, who became
entrepreneurs and barterers of art. . . . Business and industry decided to elevate
themselves to the level of the artist. The latter, in order to satisfy his need for the
luxuries which were heginning to tempt him, prostituted art to speculation and
brought about the degeneration of the artistic tradition by his calculated reduction
of art to the proportions of a trade." This last refers to the fact that [around 1837]
painters were passing on to their students commissions they had accepted them­
selves. Gabriel Pelin, Les Laideurs du beau Paris (Paris, 1861), pp. 85, 87-90.

Victor Hugo on the obstacles which hindered Parisian digging and tunneling op­
erations: ""Paris is huilt upon a deposit singularly rebellious to the spade, to the

trate thelll that geological formation upon which is superposed the wonderful his­
torical formation called Paris; as soon as . . . labor commences and ventures into
that sheet of' alluvium, subterranean resistance abounds. There are liquid clays,
living springs, hard rocks, those soft deep mires which technical science calls
moutardes. The pick advances laboriously into these calcareous strata alternating
with seams of very fine clay and laminar schistose beds, encrusted with oyster
shells contemporary with the pre-Adamite oceans." Victor Hugo, Oeuvres com­

Sewer: ""Paris . . . called it the Stink-Hole . . . . The Stink-Hole was no less revolt­

sewer of the Barillerie . . . . The mouth of the sewer of' the Rue de la Mortellerie was
famous for the pestilence which came from it . . . . Bruneseau had made a begin­
ning, but it required the cholera epidemics to determine the vast reconstruction
which has since taken place." Victor Hugo, Oeuvres completes, novels, vol. 9

180S-Bruneseau's descent into the sewers: "'Hardly had Bruneseau passed the
first branchings of the subterranean network, when eight out of the twenty labor­
ers refused to go further. . . . They advanced with difficulty. It was not uncommon
for the stepladders to plunge into three feet of' mire. The lanterns flickered in the
miasmas. From time to time, a sewerman who had fainted was carried out. At
certain places, a precipice. The soil had sunk, the pavement had crumbled, the
sewer had changed into a blind well; they found no solid ground. One man sud­
denly disappeared; they had great difficulty in recovering him. On the advice of
Fourcroy, they lighted from point to point, in the places sufficiently purified, greut
cages full of oakum saturated with resin. The wall, in places, wus covered with
shupeless fungi-one would have said with tumors. The stone itself seemed dis­
eased in this unbreathable utmosphere . . . . They thought they recognized here

Woefully inadequate references to mineral springs in Koch, who writes of the
poems dedicated by Goethe to Maria Ludovica at Karlsbad: "The essential tbing
for him in these 'Karlsbad poems' is not the geology but . . . the thought and the
sensation that healing energies emanate from the otherwise unapproachable per-
son of the princess. The intimacy of life at the spa creates a fellow feeling . . . with
the noble lady. Thus, . . . in the presence of the mystery of the springs, health
comes . . . from the proximity of the princess:' Richard Koch, Der <auber der

Whereas a journey ordinarily gives the bourgeois the illusion of slippiug the ties
that bind him to his social class, the wateriug place fortifies his consciousness of
belonging to the upper class. It does this not ouly by bringing him into contact
with feudal strata. Mornaud draws attention to a more elementary circumstance:
"In Paris there are no doubt larger crowds, but none so homogeneous as this one;
for most of the sad human beings who make up those crowds will have eaten
either badly or hardly at all . . . . But at Baden, nothing of the sort: everyone is
happy, seeing that everyone's at Baden." Felix Mornand, La Vie des eaux (paris,

The meditative stroll through the pump room proves advantageous to business,
chiefly through the agency of art. The contemplative attitude that schools itself
on the work of art is slowly transformed into an attitude more covetous of the
wares on display. "Having taken a turn before the Trinkhalle, . . . or beneath the
frescoed peristyle of this Greco-German-Italianate colonnade, one will come in­

" Nevertheless, we see a continuous stream of new works in which the city is the

But the great reminiscences, the historical shudder-these are a trumpery which
he (the fI&neur) leaves to tourists, who think thereby to gain access to the genius
loci with a military password. Our friend may well keep silent. At the approach of
his footsteps, the place has roused; speechlessly, mindlessly, its mere intimate
nearness gives him hints and instructions. He stands before Notre Dame de
Lorette, and his soles remember: here is the spot where in former times the cheval
de rerifOrt-the spare horse-was harnessed to the omnibus that climbed the Rue
des Martyrs toward Montmartre. Often, he would have given all he knows about
the domicile of Balzac or of Gavarni, about the site of a surprise attack or even of
a barricade, to be able to catch the scent of a threshold or to recognize a paving
stone by touch, like any watchdog.                                            [M!,!]

The street conducts the flmeur into a vanished time. For him, every street is
precipitous. It leads downward-if not to the mythical Mothers, then into a past
that can be all the more spellbinding because it is not his own, not private.
Nevertheless, it always remains the time of a childhood. But why that of the life
he has lived? In the asphalt over which he passes, his steps awaken a surprising
resonance. The gaslight that streams down on the paving stones throws an
equivocal light on this double ground.                                    [M! ,2]
An intoxication comes over the man who walks long and aimlessly through the
streets. With each step, the walk takes on greater momentum; ever weaker grow
the temptations of shops, of bistros, of smiling women, ever more irresistible the
magnetism of the next streetcorner, of a distant mass of foliage, of a street name.
Then comes hunger. Our man wants nothing to do with the myriad possibilities
offered to sate his appetite. Like an ascetic arrimal, he flits through unknown
districts-until, utterly exhausted, he stumbles into his room, which receives him
coldly and wears a strange air.                                                  [Ml,3J

Paris created the type of the flaneur. What is remarkable is that it wasn't Rome.
And the reason? Does not dreanring itself take the high road in Rome? And isn't
that city too full of temples, enclosed squares, national shrines, to be able to enter
tout entiere-with every cobblestone, every shop sign, every step, and every gate­
way-into the passerby's dreanl? The national character of the Italians may also
have much to do with this. For it is not the foreigners but they themselves, the
Parisians, who have made Paris the promised land of the flilneur-the "landscape
built of sheer life;' as Hofmannsthal once put it. Landscape-that, in fact, is what
Paris becomes for the flaneur. Or, more precisely: the city splits for him into its
dialectical poles. It opens up to him as a landscape, even as it closes around him
as a room.                                                                       [Ml,4J

That ananmestic intoxication in which the flaneur goes about the city not only
feeds on the sensory data taking shape before his eyes but often possesses itself of
abstract knowledge-indeed, of dead facts-as something experienced and lived
through. This felt knowledge travels from one person to another, especially by
word of mouth. But in the course of the nineteenth century, it was also deposited
in an inunense literature. Even before Lefeuve, who described Paris "street by
street, house by house;' there were numerous works that depicted this storied
landscape as backdrop for the dreaming idler. The study of these books consti­
ruted a second existence, already wholly predisposed toward dreaming; and
what the flilneur learned from them took form and fignre during an afternoon
walk before the aperitif. Wouldn't he, then, have necessarily felt the steep slope
behind the church of Notre Dame de Lorette rise all the more insistently under
his soles if he realized: here, at one time, after Paris had gotten its first omnibuses,
the cheval de renflrt was harnessed to the coach to reinforce the two other horses.
[Ml,5J

One must make an effort to grasp the altogether fascinating moral constitution of
the passionate flilneur. The police-who here, as on so many of the subjects we
are treating, appear as experts-provide the following indication in the report of
a Paris secret agent from October 1798(?) : "It is almost inlpossible to summon
and maintain good moral character in a thickly massed population where each
individual, unbeknownst to all the others, hides in the crowd, so to speak, and
blushes before the eyes of no one:' Cited in Adolf Schmidt, Pariser Zustiinde
wiihrend der Revolution, vol. 3 (Jena, 1876). The case in which the flaneur com-
pletely distances himself from the type of the philosophical promenader, and
takes on the features of the werewolf restlessly roaming a social wilderness, was
fixed for the first time and forever afterward by Poe in his story "The Man of the
Crowd."                                                                         [M!,6]


The appearances of superposition, of overlap, which come with hashish may be
grasped through the concept of similitude. When we say that one face is similar
to another, we mean that certain features of tllis second face appear to us in the
first, without the latter's ceasing to be what it has been. Nevertheless, the possi­
bilities of entering into appearance in this way are not subject to any criterion and
are therefore boundless. The category of similarity, which for the waking con­
sciousness has only mininlal relevance, attains unlimited relevance in the world
of hashish. There, we may say, everything is face: each thing has the degree of
bodily presence that allows it to be searched-as one searches a face-for such
traits as appear. Under these conditions even a sentence (to say nothing of the
single word) puts on a face, and this face resembles that of the sentence standing
opposed to it. In this way every truth points manifestly to its opposite, and this
state of affairs explains the existence of doubt. Truth becomes something living;
it lives solely in the rhythm by which statement and counterstatement displace
each other in order to think each otller."                                     [M!a,!]


Valery Larbaud on the "moral climate of tile Parisian street." "Relations always
begin with the fiction of equality, of Christian fraternity. In this crowd the inferior
is disguised as the superior, and the superior as tile inferior-disguised morally,
in both cases. In other capitals of the world, me disguise barely goes beyond me
appearance, and people visibly insist on meir differences, making an effort to
retain them in me face of pagans and barbarians. Here they efface them as much
as mey can. Hence me peculiar sweetness of me moral clinlate of Parisian streets,
me charm which makes one pass over the vulgarity, me indolence, the monotony
of tile crowd. It is the grace of Paris, its virtue: charity. Virtuous crowd . . ;'
Valery Larbaud, "Rues et visages de Paris : Pour I'album de Chas-Laborde;'
Commerce, 8 (Summer 1926), pp. 36-3Z Is it permissible to refer this phenomenon
so confidently to Christian virtue, or is mere not perhaps at work here an intoxi­
cated assinlllation, superposition, equalization mat in the streets of this city
proves to carry more weight man me will to social accreditation? One might
adduce here the hashish experience "Dante und Petrarca,",1 and measure the
inlpact of intoxicated experience on the proclamation of me rights of man. This
all unfolds at a considerable remove from Christianity.                        [M!a,2]


The "colportage phenomenon of space" is the flilneur's basic experience. Inas­
much as this phenomenon also-from anomer angle-shows itself in me mid­
nineteenm-century interior, it may not be amiss to suppose mat me heyday of
flilnerie occur in this same period. Thanks to this phenomenon, everything poten­
tially taking place in this one single room is perceived sinlultaneously. The space
winks at the flaneur: What do you think may have gone on here? Of course, it
has yet to be explained how this phenomenon is associated with colportage.'

A true masquerade of space-that is what the British embassy's ball on May 17,
1839, must have been. "In addition to the glorious flowers from gardens and
greenhouses, 1 ,000-1,200 rosebushes were ordered as part of the decoration for
the festivities. It was said that only 800 of them could fit in the rooms of the
embassy, but that will give you an idea of the utterly mythological magnificence.
The garden, covered by a pavilion, was turned into a salon de conversation. But
what a salon! The gay flower beds, full of blooms, were huge jardinieres which
everyone came over to admire; the gravel on the walks was covered with fresh
linen, out of consideration for all the white satin shoes; large sofas of lampas and
of damask replaced the wrought-iron benches; and on a round table there were
books and albums. It was a pleasure to take the air in this immense boudoir,
where one could hear, like a magic chant, the sounds of the orchestra, and where
one could see passing, like happy shadows, in the three surrounding flower-lined
galleries, both the fun-loving girls who came to dance and the more serious girls
who came to sup:' H. d'Almeras, La     Vie pari5ienne sous <Ie regne do Louis­

The principle of colportage illustration encroaching on great painting. "The re­
ports on the engagements and battles which, in the catalogue, were supposed to
illuminate the momeuts chosen by the painter for battle scenes, but which failed
to achieve this goal, were usually augmented with citatious of the works from
which these reports were drawn. Thus, one would find at the end, frequently in

Category o f illustrative seeing-fundamental for the flaneur. Like Kubin when

Hashish. One imitates certain things one knows from paintings: prison, the
Bridge of Sighs, stairs like the train of a dress.                                [M2,3]

We know that, in the course of flftnerie, far-off times and places interpenetrate the
landscape and the present moment. When the authentically intoxicated phase of
this condition announces itself, the blood is pounding in the veins of the happy
flaneur, his heart ticks like a clock, and inwardly as well as outwardly things go
on as we would imagine them to do in one of those "mechanical pictures" which
in the nineteenth century (and of course earlier, too) enjoyed great popularity,
and which depicts in the foreground a shepherd playing on a pipe, by his side two
children swaying in time to the music, hlrther back a pair of hunters in pursuit of
a lion, and very much in the background a train crossing over a trestle bridge.

With the steady increase in traffic on the streets, it was only the macadarnization

The laissez-faire of the flilneur has its counterpart even in the revolutionary
philosophemes of the period. "We smile at the chimerical pretension [of a Saint­
Simon] to trace all physical and moral phenomena back to the law of universal
attraction. But we forget too easily that this pretension was not in itself isolated;
under the influence of the revolutionizing natural laws of mechanics, there could
arise a current of natural philosophy which saw in the mechanism of nature the
proof of just such a mechanism of social life and of events generally." ,Willy,
SpUhler, Der Sain/-Simonismus (Zurich, 1926), p. 29.                           [M2,7]

Dialectic of flilnerie: on one side, the man who feels himself viewed by all and
sundry as a true suspect and, on the other side, the man who is utterly undis­
coverable, the hidden man. Presumably, it is this dialectic that is developed in
"The Man of the Crowd;'                                                   [M2,8]

The principle of flilnerie in Proust: "Then, quite apart from all those literary
preoccupations, and without definite attachment to anything, suddenly a roof, a
gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone, the smell of a road would make me stop
still, to enjoy the special pleasure that each of them gave me, and also because
they appeared to be concealing, beneath wbat my eyes could see, something
which tI,ey invited me to approach and take from them, but which, despite all my
efforts, I never managed to discover;' Du Cote de chez Swann ,(Paris, 1939), vol. 1 ,
p . 256.,7-This passage shows very clearly how the old Romantic sentiment for
landscape dissolves and a new Romantic conception of landscape emerges-of
landscape that seems, rather, to be a cityscape, if it is true that the city is the
properly sacred ground of flilnerie. In this passage, at any rate, it would be
presented as such for the first time since Baudelaire (whose work does not yet
portray the arcades, though they were so numerous in his day) .               [M2a,1]

So the flilneur goes for a walk in his room: "WhenJohannes sometimes asked for
permission to go out, it was usually denied him But on occasion his father
.



proposed, as a substitute, that they walk up and down the room hand in hand.
This seemed at first a poor substitute, but in fact . . . something quite novel
awaited him The proposal was accepted, and it was left entirely to Johannes to
.



decide where they should go. Off they went, then, right out the front entrance,
out to a neighboring estate or to the seashore, or simply through the streets,
exactly as Johannes could have wished; for his father managed everything.
While they strolled in this way up and down the floor of his room, his father told
him of all they saw. 11ley greeted other pedestrians; passing wagons made a din
around them and drowned out his fatl,er's voice; the comfits in the pastry shop

"The manufacturer passes over the asphalt conscious of its quality; the old man

On the Parisians' technique of inhabiting ilieir streets: "Returning by the Rue
Saint-Honore, we met with an eloquent example of that Parisian street industry
which can make use of anything. Men were at work repairing the pavement and
laying pipeline, and, as a reslt!� in the middle of the street there was an area
which was blocked off but which was embanked and covered with stones. On
this spot street vendors had immediately installed themselves, and five or six
were selling writing implements and notebooks, cutlery, lampshades, garters,
embroidered collars, and all sorts of trinkets. Even a dealer in secondhand goods
had opened a branch office here and was displaying on the stones his brie-it-brae
of old cups, plates, glasses, and so forth, so that husiness was profiting, instead of
suffering, from the brief disturbance. They are simply wizards at making a
virtue of necessity:' Adolf Stalrr, Nach funf Jahren (Oldenburg, 1857), vol. 1 ,
p. 29,'
Seventy years later, I had the same experience at the corner of the Boulevard
Saint-Germain and ilie Boulevard Raspail. Parisians make the street an interior.

"It is wonderful that in Paris itself one can actually wander through countryside."
Karl Gutzkow, Briqfo aus Paris (Leipzig, 1842), vol. 1 , p. 6 1 . The other side of the
motif is thus touched on. For if flilnerie can transform Paris into one great
interior-a house whose rooms are the qum-tiers, no less clearly demarcated by
thresholds than are real rooms-then, on the other hand, the city can appear to
someone walking through it to be without thresholds: a landscape in the round.

"There-on the Avenue des Champs-E1ysees-it has stood since 1845: the

hardly deserves the name of winter garden." When the sphere of planning cre­
ates such entanglements of closed room and airy nature, then it serves in this way
to meet the deep human need for daydreaming-a propensity that perhaps
proves the true efficacy of idleness in human affairs. Woldemar Seyffarth, Wilhr­

��Le COl'busier's houses depend on neither spatial nor plastic articulation: the air

fall away." Sigfried Giedion, Bauen in Frankreich <Berlin, 1928>, p . 85. [M3a,3]

Streets are the dwelling place of the collective. The collective is an eternally
unquiet, eternally agitated being that-in the space between the building fronts­
experiences, learns, understands, and invents as much as individuals do within
the privacy of their own four walls. For this collective, glossy enameled shop
signs are a wall decoration as good as, if not better than, an oil painting in the
drawing room of a bourgeois ; walls with their "Post No Bills" are its writing desk,
newspaper stands its libraries, mailboxes its bronze bnsts, benches its bedroom
furniture, and the cafe terrace is the balcony from which it looks down on its
household. The section of railing where road workers hang their jackets is the
vestibule, and the gateway which leads from the row of courtyards out into the
open is the long corridor that daunts the bourgeois, being for the courtyards the
entry to the chambers of the city. Among these latter, the arcade was the drawing
room. More than anywhere else, the street reveals itself in the arcade as the
furnished and familiar interior of the masses.                               [M3a,4]

The intoxicated interpenetration of street and residence such as comes about in
the Paris of the nineteenth century-and especially in the experience of the
f1aneur-has prophetic value. For the new architecture lets this interpenetration
become sober reality. Giedion on occasion draws attention to this : "A detail of
anonymous engineering, a grade crossing, beconles an elenlent in the architec­
ture" (that is, of a villa) . S. Giedion, Bauen in Frankreich <Berlin, 1928>, p. 89.

��Hugo, in Les Miserables, has provided an amazing description of the Faubourg
Saint-Marceau: �It was no longer a place of solitude, for there were people passing;
it was not the country, for there were houses and streets; it was not a city, for the
streets had ruts in them, like the highways, and grass grew along their borders; it
was not a village, for the houses were too lofty. What was it then? It was an
inhabited place where there was nobody, it was a desert place where there was
somebody; it was a houlevard of the great city, a street of Paris-wilder at night
than a forest, and gloomier by day than a graveyard. "'to <Lucien> Dubech and

"The last horse-drawn omnibus made its final run on the Villette-Saint Sulpice
line in January 1913; the last horse-drawn tram, on the Pantin-Opera line in April
of the same year." Dubech and d'Espezel, Histoire de Paris, p. 463.        [M3a,7]

��On January 30, 1828, the first omnibus began operation on the line running along
the boulevard from the Bastille to the Madeleine. The fare was twenty-five or
thirty centimes; the car stopped where one wished. It had eighteen to twenty seats,
and its route was divided into two stages, with the Saint-Martin gate as midpoint.
The vogue for this invention was extraordinary: in 1829, the company was run­
ning fifteen lines, and rival companies were offering stiff competition-Tricycles,
Ecossaises <Scots Women>, B€mrnaises <Gascon Women> , Dames Blanches <Ladies
in White). Dubech and d'Espezel, Ilistoire de Paris, p. 358-359.           [M3a,B]

��Mter an hour the gathering broke up, and for the first time I found the streets of
Paris nearly deserted. On the boulevards I met only unaccompanied persons, and
on the Rue Vivienne at Stock Mal·ket Square, where by day you have to wind your
way through the crowd, there wasn't a soul. I could hear nothing but my own steps
and the murmur of fountains where by day you cannot escape the deafening buzz.
In the vicinity of the Palais Royal I encountered a patrol. The soldiers were ad­
vancing single file along both sides of the street, close to the houses, at a distance of
five or six paces from one another so as not to be attacked at the same time and so
as to be able to render mutual aid. This reminded me that, at the very heginning of
my stay here, I had been advised to proceed in this manner myself at night when
with several others, hut, U' I had to go home alone, always to take a cah." Eduard

On the omnibuses. "The driver stops and you mount the few steps of the conven­
ient little staircase and look about for a place in the car, where henches extend
lengthwise on the right and the left, with room for up to sixteen people. You've
hardly set foot in the car when it starts rolling again. The conductor has once more
pulled the cord, and, with a quick movement that causes a hell to sound, he
advances the needle on a transparent dial to indicate that another person has
entered; by this means they keep track of receipts. Now that the car is moving, you
reach calmly into your wallet and pay the fare. If you happen to be sitting reason­
ably far from the conductor, the money travels from hand to hand among the
passengers; the well-dressed lady takes it from the workingman in the blue jacket
and passes it on. This is all accomplished easily, in routine fashion, and without
any bother. When someone is to exit, the conductor again pulls the cord and brings
the car to a halt. If it is going uphill-which in Paris it often is-and therefore is
going more slowly, men will customarily climb on and off without the car's having
to stop." Eduard Devrient, Briefe au, Paris (Berlin, 1840), p. 61-62.        [M4,2]


��It was after the Exhibition of 1867 that one began to see those velocipedes which,
some years later, had a vogue as widespread as it was short-lived. We may recall
that under the Directory certain Incroyables l l could be seen riding velociferes ,
which were bulky, badly constructed velocipedes. On May 19, 1804" a play entitled
Velociferes was performed at the Vaudeville; it contained a song with this verse:
You, partisans of the gentle gait,
Coachmen who have lost the spur,
Would you now accelerate
Beyond the prompt velocifere?
Learn then how to suhstitute
Dexterity for speed.

By the beginning of 1868, however, velocipedes were in circulation, and soon the
public walkways were everywhere furrowed. Velocemen replaced boatmen. There
were gymnasia and arenas for velocipedists, and competitions were set up to ehal­
lenge the skill of amateurs . . . . Today the velocipede is finished and forgotten. "

The peculiar irresolution of the flilneur. Just as waiting seems to be the proper
state of the impassive thinker, doubt appears to be that of the flii.neur. An elegy by
Schiller contains the phrase: "the hesitant wing of the butterfly:'" This points to
that association of wingedness with the feeling of indecision which is so charac­
teristic of hashish intoxication.                                              [M4a,1]

graphical notes to the five-volume edition of his later writings (Brodhag?) ,13 we
read: "Hoffmann was never really a friend of the great outdoors. What mattered
to him more than anything else was the human being-commUlucation with,
observations about, the simple sight of, human beings. Whenever he went for a
walk in summer, which in good weather happened every day toward evening,
then . . . there was scarcely a tavem or pastry shop where he would not look in to
see whether anyone-and, if so, who-might be there:'                            [M4a,2]

�'A town, such as London, where a man may wander for hours together without.
reaching the beginning of the end, wit.hout meeting the slightest hint which could
lead to the inference that there is open country within reach, is a strange thing.
This colossal (�entralization, this heaping together of two and a half millions of
human beings at one point, has multiplied the power of this two and a half millions
a hundredfold; has raised London to the commercial capital of the world, created
the giant docks and assembled the thousand vessels that continually cover the
Thames . . . . But the sacrifices which all this has cost become apparent later. Mter
roaming the streets of the capital a day or two, . . . one realizes for the first time
that these Londoners have been forced to sacrifice the best qualities of their hu­
man nature to bring to pass all the marvels of civilization . . . . The very turmoil of
the streets has something repulsive about it-something against which human na­
ture rebels. The hundreds of thousands of all classes and ranks crowding past
each other-aren't they all human beings wit.h the same qualities and powers, and
wit.h the same interest in being happy'? And aren't they obliged, in t.he end, to seek
happiness in the same way, by the same means? And still they crowd by one
another as though they had nothing in common, nothing to do with one another,
and their only agreement is the tacit one-that each keep to his own side of the
pavement, so as not to delay the opposing streams of the crowd-while no man
thinks to honor another with so much as a glance. The brutal indifference, the
unfeeling isolation of each in his private interest becomes the more repellent and
offensive, the more these individuals are crowded together within a limited space.
And however much one may be aware that this isolation of the individual, this
narrow self-seeking, is the fundamental principle of our society everywhere, it is
nowhere so shamelessly barefaced, so self-conscious, as just here in the crowding
of the great city." Friedrich Engels, Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England,

'·By "bohemians' I mean that class of individuals for whom existence is a problem,
circumstances a myth, and fortune an enigma; who have no sort of fixed abode, no
place of refuge; who belong nowhere and are met with everywhere; who have no
particular calling in life but follow fifty professions; who, for the most part, arise
in the morning without knowing where they are to dine in the evening; who are rich
today, impoverished tomorrow; who are ready to live honestly if they can, and
otherwise if they cannot. " Adolphe d 'Ennery and Grange, Les Bohemiens de Paris

'·When the first German railway line was about to be constructed in Bavaria, the
medical faculty at Erlangen published an expert opinion . . . ; the rapid movement

Remarkable distinction between Hanenr and rubberneck (badaud): "Let us not,
however, confuse the Haneur with the rubberneck: there is a subtle difference . . . .
The average Haneur . . . is always in full possession of his individuality, while that
of the rubberneck disappears, absorbed by the external world, . . . which moves
him to the point of intoxication and ecstasy. Under the influence of the spectacle,
the rubberneck becomes an impersonal being. He is no longer a man-he is the
public; he is the crowd. At a distance from nature, his naive soul aglow, ever
inclined to reverie, . . . the true ruhberneck deserves the admiration of all upright
and sincere hearts." Victor Fournel, Ce qu'on voit dans les rues de Paris (Paris,

On the colportage phenomenon of space: '''The sense of mystery,' wrote Odilon

the state of mind of the spectator. All things more suggestive just because they do
appeal'. ' " Cited in Raymond Escholier, '�Artiste," Arts et metiers graphiques, No.

In the musical revue by Barre, Radet, and Desfontaines, M. Dureliej, ou, Petite
Revue des embellissemens de Paris (Paris, 1810), performed at the Theatre de
Vaudeville on June 9, 1810, Paris in the form of a model constructed by M . Dure­
lief has migrated into the scenery. The chorus declares "how agreeahle it is to have
all of Paris in one's drawing room" (p. 20). The plot revolves around a wager
hetween the architect Durelief and the painter Ferdinand; if the former, in his
model of Paris, omits any sort of "emhellishment," then his daughter Victorine
straightaway helongs to Ferdinand, who otherwise has to wait two years for her. It
turns out that Durelief has forgotten Her Majesty the Empress Marie Louise, ��the

The city is the realization of that ancient dream of humanity, the labyrinth. It is
this reality to which the f1!lneur, without knowing it, devotes himself. Without
knowing it; yet notlllng is more foolish than the conventional thesis which ration­
alizes his behavior, and which fonns the uncontested basis of that voluminous
literature that traces the figure and demeanor of the flaneur-the thesis, namely,
that the flaneur has made a study of the physiognomic appearance of people in
order to discover their nationality and social station, character and destiny, from
a perusal of their gait, build, and play of features. TI,e interest in concealing the
true motives of the flaneur must have been pressing indeed to have occasioned
such a shabby thesis.                                                         [M6a,4]

As early as 1853, there arc official statistics concerning vehicular traffic at certain
Parisian nerve centers. " In 1853, thirty-one omnibus lines were serving Paris, and
it is worth noting that, with a few exceptions, these lines were designated by the
same letters used for the autobus lines operating at that time. Thus it was that the
'Madeleine-Bastille' line was already Line E." Paul d'Ariste, La Vie et le monde

At connecting stations for the omnibus, passengers were called up in numerical
order and had to answer when called if they wanted to preserve their right to a
seat. (1855)                                                             [M7,4]

Louis Lurine, Le Ti-eizieme Arrondissement de Paris (paris, 1850), is one of the most
noteworthy testimonials to the distinctive physiognomy of the neighborhood.
The book has certain stylistic peculiarities. It personifies the quartier. Formulas
like "'-[he thirteenth arrondissement devotes itself to a man's love only when it can
furnish him with vices to love" (p. 216) are not unusual."                      [M7,6]

Regarding the legend of the flaneur: (,�With the aid of a word I overhear in passing,
I reconstruct an entire conversation, an entire existence. The inflection of a voice
sufftees for me to attach the name of a deadly sin to the man whom I have just
jostled and whose proftle I glimpsed." Victor Fournel, Ce qu'on voit dans les rues

In 1857 there was still a coach departing from the Rue Pavee-Saint-Andre at 6 A.M.
for Venice; the trip took six weeks. See Fournel, Ce qu 'on voit dans les rues de
Paris (Paris), p. 273.                                                      [M7,9]

approach it. Those who make their living from travelers . . . can he recognized
ordinarily hy their coarse rowdiness . . . , hut omnihus employees, virtually alone

The first proposal for an omnibus system came from Pascal and was realized
under Louis XIV, with the characteristic restriction ';'that soldiers, pages, foot­
men, and other livery, including laborers and hired hands, were not permitted
entry into said coaches." In 1828, introduction of the omnibuses, about which a

Among the phantoms of the city is "Lambert"-an invented figure, a flaneur
perhaps. In any case, he is allotted the boulevard as the scene of his apparitions.
There is a famous couplet with the refrain, "Eh, Lambert!" Delvau, in his Lions
dujour <Paris, 1867>, devotes a paragraph to him (p. 228).                 [M7a,4]

A rustic figure in the urban scene is described by Delvau in his chapter "Le
Pauvre a cheval" <Poor Man on Horseback>, in Les Lions dujour. "This horsenlan
was a poor devil whose means forbade his going on foot, and who asked for alms
as another man might ask for directions . . . . This mendicant . . . on his little nag,
with its wild mane and its shaggy coat like that of a rural donkey, has long
remained before my eyes and in my imagination. . . . He died-a rentier." Alfred

tcn-cent emotions, a stranger to all that was not cobblestone, cab, or gas lamp, . . .
he has become a laborer, a wine grower, a manufacturer of wool, sugar, and iron.
He is no longer dwnbfounded at nature's ways. The germination of a plant no

In his pamphlet Le Siecle maudil (paris, 1843), which takes a stand against the
corruption of contemporary society, Alexis Dumesnil makes use of a fiction of
Juvenal's: the crowd on the boulevard suddenly stops still, and a record of each
individual's thoughts and objectives at that particular moment is compiled
(pp. 103-104).                                                                     [MS,2]

"The contradiction between town and country . . . is the crassest expression of the

afternoon to labors of wandering. He adored the upper levels of omnibuses-those

" The most heterogeneous temporal elements thus coexist in the city. If we step
from an eighteenth-century house into one from the sixteenth century, we tumble
down the slope of time. Right next door stands a Gothic church, and we sink to the
depths. A few steps farther, we are in a street from out of the early years of
Bismarck's rule . . . , and once again climbing the mountain of time. Whoever sets
foot in a city feels caught up as in a web of dreams, where the most remote past is
linked to the events of today. One house allies with another, no matter what period
they come from, and a street is horn. And then insofar as this street, which may go
hack to the age of Goethe, runs into another, which may date from the Wilhelmine
years, the district emerges . . . . The climactic points of the city are its squares:
here, from every direction, converge not only numerous streets but all the streams
of theil' history. No sooner have they flowed in than they are contained; the edges
of the square serve as quays, so that already the outward form of' the square
provides information about the history that was played upon it. . . . Things which
find no expression in political events, or find only minimal expression, unfold in
the cities: they are a superfine instrument, responsive as an Aeolian harp-despite
their specific gravity-to the living historic vibrations of the air." Ferdinand Lion,

"A man who goes for a walk ought not to have to concern himself with any hazards
he may run into or with the regulations of a city. If an amusing idea enters his
head, if a curious shopfront comes into view, it is natural that he would want to
cross the street without confronting dangers such as our grandparents could not
have imagined. But he cannot do this today without taking a hundred precautions,
-without checking the horizon, without asking the advice of the police department,
without mixing with a dazed and breathless herd, for whom the way is marked out
in advance by hits of shining metal. If he tries to collect the whimsical thoughts
that may have come to mind, very possihly occasioned by sights on the street, he is
deafened by car horns, stupefied by loud talkers . . . , and demoralized by the
scraps of conversation, of political meetings, of jazz, which escape slyly from the
windows. In former times, moreover, his brothers, the rubbernecks, who ambled
along so easily down the sidewalks and stopped a moment everywhere, lent to the
stream of humanity a gentleness and a tranquillity which it has lost. Now it is a
torrent where you are rolled, buffeted, cast up, and swept to one side and the
other. " Edmond Jaloux, �'Le Dernier Flfineur," Le Temps (May 22, 1936).

The urban in Balzae: "'Nature appears to him in its magieal aspect as the arcanum
of matter. It appears to him in its symbolic aspeet as the reverberation of human
energies and aspirations: in the crashing of the ocean's waves, he experiences the
"exaltation of human forces'; and in the show of color and fragrance produced by
flowers , he reads the cipher of love's longing. Always, for him, nature signifies
something other, an intimation of spirit. The opposite movement he does not rec­
ognize: the immersion of the human back into nature, the saving accord with stars,
clouds, winds. He was far too engrossed by the tensions of human existence."

"'Balzac lived a life . . . of furious haste and premature collapse, a life such as that
imposed on the inhabitants of hig cities by the struggle for existence in modern
society. . . . In Balzac's case we see, for the first time, a genius who shares such a
life and lives it as his own." Ernst Rohert Curtius, Balzac (Bonn, 1923), pp. 4·64+-
465. On the question of tempo, compare the following: "'Poetry and art . . . derive
from a "quick inspection of things. ' . . . In Seraphita. velocity is introduced as an
essential feature of artistic intuition: "that "mind's eye' whose rapid perception
can engender within the soul, as on a canvas, the most diverse landscapes of the
world."'" Ernst Robert Curtin" Balzac (Bonn, 1923), p. 445.                     [MIO,3]

"'If God . . . has imprinted every man's destiny in his physiognomy, . . why
shouldn't the human hand sum up that physiognomy in itself, since the hand
comprises human action in its entirety and is its sole means of manifestation?
Hence palmistry. . . . To foretell the events of a man's life from the study of his
hand is a feat . . . no more extraordinary than telling a soldier he is going to fight,
a barrister that he is going to plead a cause, a cobbler that he is going to make
boots or shoes, a farmer that he is going to fertilize and plough his land. Let us take
a still more striking example: genius is a sort of immaterial sun whose rays give
color to everything passing by. Cannot an idiot be immediately recognized by
characteristics which are the opposite of those shown by a man of genius? . . . Most
observant people, students of social nature in Paris, are able to tell the profession
of a passerby as they see him approach. " Honore de Balzac, Le Cousin Pons, in

" What men call love is very small, very restricted, and very weak compared with

" Which of us, in his moments of ambition, has not dreamed of the miracle of a
poetic prose, musical, without rhythm and without rhyme. supple enough and
rugged enough to adapt itself to the lyrical impulses of the soul, the undulations of
reverie, the jibes of conscience? / It was, above all, out of my exploration of huge

ideal was born." Charles Baudelaire, Le Spleen de Pa,ris, ed. R. Simon, pp. 1-2

" The artist seeks eternal truth and knows nothing of the eternity in his midst. He
admires the column of the Babylonian temple and scorns the smokestack on the
factory. Yet what is the difference in their lines? When the era of coal-powered
industry is over, people will admire the vestiges of the last smokestacks, as today
we admire the remains of temple columns . . . . The steam vapor so detested by
writers allows them to divert their admiration . . . . Instead of waiting to visit the
Bay of Bengal to find objects to exclaim over, they might have a little curiosity
about the objects they see in daily life. A porter at the Gare de PEst is no less
picturesque t.han a coolie in Colombo . . . . To walk out your front door as if you've

Chesterton fastens on a specimen of English argot to characterize Dickens in his
relation to the street: "He has the key to the street" is said of someone to whom the
door is closed. �'Dickens himself had, in the lllost sacred and serious sense of the
term, the key to the street. . . . His earth was the stones of the street; his stars were
the lamps of the street; his hero was the man in the street. He could open the
inmost door of Iris house-the door that leads into that secret passage which is
lined with houses and roofed with stars." G. K. Chesterton, Dickens, series enti­

Dickens as a child: "Whenever he had done drudging, he had no other resource but
drifting, and he drifted over half London. He was a dreamy child, thinking mostly
of Iris own dreary prospects . . . . He did not go in for �observation,' a priggish
habit; he did not look at Charing Cross to improve his mind 01' count the lamp­
posts in Holborn to practice his arithmetic. But unconsciously he made all these
places the scenes of the monstrous drama in his miserable little soul. He walked in
darkness under the lamps of Holborn, and was crucified at Charing Cross. So for
him ever afterwards these places had the beauty that only belongs to battlefields."

On the psychology of the fHineur: �'The undying scenes we can all see if we shut our
eyes are not the scenes that we have stared at under the direction of guide-books;
the scenes we see are the scenes at which we did not look at all-the scenes in which
we walked when we were thinking about something else-about a sin, or a love
affair, or some childish sorrow. We can see the background now because we did not
see it then. So Dickens did not stamp these places on his mind; he stamped his
mind on these places." G. K. Chesterton, Dickens, series entitled Vie des hommes

On the detective novel: �'We must take as an established fact that this metamor­
phosis of the city is due to a transposition of the setting-namely, from the savan­
nah and forest of Fenimore Cooper, where every broken branch signifies a worry
or a hope, where every tree trunk hides an enemy rifle or the bow of an invisible
and silent avenger. Beginning with Balzac, all writers have clearly recorded this
deht and faithfully rendered to Cooper what they owed him. Works like Les Mohi­
cans de Paris, by Alexander Dumas-works where the title says all-are ex­
tremely common." Roger Caillois, " Paris, mythe moderne," Nouvelle Revue
franqaise, 25, no. 284 (May 1 , 1937), pp. 685-686.                        [MIla,5]


Owing to the influence of Cooper, it becomes possible for the novelist in an
urban setting to give scope to the experiences of the hunter. Ths has a bearing on
the rise of the detective story.                                             [MIla,6]


"It seems reasonable to say that there exists . . . a phantasmagorical repre­
sentation of Paris (and, more generally, of the big city) with such power over the
imagination that the question of its accuracy would never be posed in practice-a
representation created entirely by the book, yet so widespread as to make up . . .
part of the collective mental atmosphere." Roger Caillois, �'Paris, mythe mod­

"The Faubourg Saint-Jacques is one of the most primitive suburbs of Paris. Why
is that? Is it because it is surrounded by four hospitals as a citadel is surrounded
hy four bastions, and these hospitals keep the tourists away from the neighbor­
hood? Is it hecause, leading to no major artery and terminating in no center, . . .
the place is rarely visited by coaches? Thus, as soon as one appears in the distance,
the lucky urchin who spies it first cups his hands around his mouth and gives a
signal to all the inhabitants of the faubourg, just as, on the seashore, the one who
first spots a sail on the horizon gives a signal to the others." A. Dumas, Les Mold­
cans de Paris, vol. 1 (Paris, 1859), p. 102 (ch. 25: "Oil il est question des sauvages
du Faubourg Saint-Jacques"). The chapter describes nothing but the arrival of a
piano before a house in the district. No one suspects that the ohject is a musical
instrument, but all are enraptured by the sight of " a huge piece of mahogany"
(p. 103). For mahogany furniture was as yet hardly known in this quartier.

genius of Poe, as Valery does (io his iotroduction to LeJ Fleun du mal [paris,

activity necessarily means that one perceives a quantity of possibilities . . . . It is
therefore not surprisiog that Poe, possessiog so . . . sure a method, became the
ioventor of several different literary fOffils-that he provided the first . . . exam­
ples of the scientific tale, the modern cosmogonic poem, the detective novel, the
literature of morbid psychological states."'"                                [M12a,1]

p. 424.) : "Our eye is fixed on the man in society who moves among laws, snares, the
betrayals of his confederates, as a savage in the New World moves among reptiles,

Apropos of detective fiction: "'In the American hero-fantasy, the Indian's charac­

extraordinary concentration on a particular goal, his tenacity of purpose, his

of the Indian find full expression." C . G. Jung, Seelenprobleme der Gegenwart

From the opening pages of Les Mysteres de Paris: ��Everyone has read those admi­
rable pages in which Fenimore Cooper, the American Walter Scott, has brought to
life the fierce ways of the savages, their colorful and poetic speech, the thousand
tricks they use when following or fleeing their enemies . . . . It is our intent to bring
before the eyes of the reader some episodes in the lives of various other barbari­
ans, no less removed from the civilized world than the tribes so well portrayed by
Cooper." Cited in Regis Messac, Le "Detective Novel" (Paris, 1929), p. 425.:17

Noteworthy collllection between flanerie and the detective novel at the beginning
of Les Mohicam de Paris: "At the outset Salvator says to the poetJean Robert, 'You
want to write a novel? Take Lesage, Walter Scott, and Cooper. . . ; Then, with
characters like those of the Thousand and One Nigh.ts, they cast a piece of paper to
the winds and follow it, convinced it will lead them to a subject for a novel, which
is what in fact happens;' Regis Messac, Le "Detective Novel" et l'injluence de la

On the epigones of Sue and Balzac, ��who came swarming to the serial novels. The
influence of Cooper makes itsell' felt here sometimes directly and sometimes
through the mediation of Balzac or other imitators. Paul Feval, beginning in 1856
with Les Couteaux d'or <The Golden Knives), holdly transposes the habits and
even the inhabitants of the prairie to a Parisian setting: we find there a wonder­
fully gifted dog named Mohican, an American-style duel between hunters in a
Paris suburh, and a redskin called Towah who kills and scalps four of his enemies
in a hackney eab in the middle of Paris, and performs this feat with such dexterity
that the driver never notices. Later, in Les Habits noirs <The Black Attire> (1863),
he multiplies those comparisons of which Balzac is sO fond: �Cooper's savages in
the middle of Paris! Is not the big city as mysterious as the forests of the New
World?'" An additional remark: "Compare also dUlpters 2 and 19, in which he
brings two vagahonds on the scene, Eehalot and Similor, �Hurons of our lakes of
mud, Iroquois of the gutter. '" Regis Messac, Le " Detective Novel" et l'influence de

""That poetry of terror which the strat.agems of enemy tribes at war create in the
heart of the forests of America, and of which Cooper has made such good use, was
attached to the smallest details of Parisian life. The passersby, the shops, the
hackney carriages, a person standing at a window-to the men who had been
numhered off for the defense of Peyrade's life, everything presented the ominous
interest which in Cooper's novels may be found in a tree trunk, a beaver's dam, a
rock, a buffalo skin, a motionless canoe, a hranch drooping over the water."

Preformed in the figure of the fianeur is that of the detective. "The fianeur re­
quired a social legitimation of his habitus. It suited him very well to see his
indolence presented as a plausible front, behind which, in reality, hides the riv­
eted attention of an observer who will not let the unsuspecting malefactor out of
his sight.                                                                  [M13a,2)

At the end of Baudelaire's essay on Marceline Desbordes-Valmore emerges the
promeneur, who strolls through the garden landscape of her poetry; the perspec­
tives of the past and future open before him. "But these skies are too vast to be
everywhere pure, and the temperature of the climate too warm. . . . The idle
passerby, who contemplates these areas veiled in mourning, feels tears of hysteria
come to his eyes:' Charles Baudelaire, L'Art romantique (Paris), p. 343 ("Mar­
celine Desbordes-Valmore").39 "The promeneur is no longer capable of "meander­
ing capriciously." He takes refuge in the shadow of cities; he becomes a fianeur.

It would be profitable to discover certain definite features leading toward the
physiognomy of the city dweller. Example: the sidewalk, which is reserved for
the pedestrian, runs along the roadway. Thus, the city dweller in the course of his
most ordinary affairs, if he is on foot, has constantly before his eyes the image of
the competitor who overtakes him in a vehicle.-Certainly the sidewalks were
laid down in the interests of those who go by car or by horse. When?             [MI4,6]

" For the perfect flaneur, . . . it is an immense joy to set up house in the heart of the
multitude, amid the ebb and flow. . . . To be away from home, yet to feel oneself

remain hidden from t.he world-such are a few of the slightest pleasures of those
independent, passionate, impartial [ ! ! ] natures which the tongue can but clumsily
define. The spectator is a prince who everywhere rejoices in his incognito . . . . The
lover of universal life enters into the crowd as though it were an immense reservoir
of electric energy. We might also liken him to a mirror as vast as the crowd itself; or
to a kaleidoscope endowed with consciousness, which, with each one of its move­

The Paris of 1908. " A Parisian used to crowds, to traffic, and to choosing his
streets could still go for long walks at a steady pace and even without taking much
care. Generally speaking, the abundance of means of transportation had not yet
given more than three million people the . . . idea that they could move about just
as they liked and that distance was the last thing that counted." Jules Romains,

carry something, or perhaps to bear news of something" (p. 179):14 In this game
of travel, Romains develops some perspectives-particularly the alpine land­

Maxim of the fHinenr: (,�In our standardized and uniform world, it is right here,

thrilling exoticism, arc all close hy." Daniel Hal{wy, Pays parisiens (Paris <1932» ,

In Jules Romains' Crime de Oginette (Les Hommes de bonne volonti, book 2), one
finds something like the negative of the solitude which is generally companion to
the H&neur. It is, perhaps, that friendship is strong enough to break through such
solitude-this is what is convincing about Romains' thesis. "According to my
idea, it's always rather in that way that you make friends with anybody. You are
present together at a moment in the life of the world, perhaps in the presence of a
Heeting secret of the world-an apparition which nobody has ever seen before
and perhaps nobody will ever see again. It may even be something very little.
Take two men going for a walk, for example, like us. Suddenly, thanks to a break
in the clouds, a ray of light comes and strikes the top of a wall; and the top of the
wall becomes, for the moment, something in some way quite extraordinary. One
of the two men touches the other on the shoulder. The other raises his head and
sees it too, understands it too. Then the thing up there vanishes. But they will
know in aeternum that it once existed," Jules Romains, Les Hommes de bonne

The tangle of the forest as archetype of mass existence in Hugo: "An astonishing

in this street would not have surprised a forest. The trees, tl,e copse, tl,e heath,

The classic early description of the crowd in Poe: "By far the greater number of
those who went by had a satisfied, business-like demeanor, and seemed to be
thinking only of making their way through the press. Their brows were knit, and
their eyes rolled quickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they evinced
no symptom of inlpatience, but adjusted their clothes and hurried on. Others,
still a numerous class, were restless in their movements, had flushed faces, and
talked and gesticulated to themselves, as if feeling in solitude on account of the
very denseness of the company around. When impeded in their progress, these
people suddenly ceased muttering, but redoubled their gesticulations, and
awaited, with an absent and overdone smile upon the lips, the course of the
persons impeding them. If jostled, they bowed profusely to the jostlers, and
appeared overwhelmed with confusion:' Poe, Nouvelles Histoires extraordinaires,

The image of antiquity that so dazzled France is sometimes to be found in
immediate proximity to the extremely modern image of America. Balzac on the
commercial traveler: "See! What an athlete, what an arena, and what a weapon:
he, the world, and his tongue! A daring seaman, he embarks with a stock of mere
words to go and fish for money, five or six hundred thousand francs, say, in the
frozen ocean, the land of savages, of Iroquois-in France!" H. de Balzac, L'Illustre

Description of the crowd in Baudelaire � to be compared with the description in
Poe:
The gutter, dismal bcd, carries along its foulnesses,
Carries, boiling, the secrets of the sewers;
It slaps in corrosive wavcs against the houses,
Rushes on to jaundice and corrupt the river Seine,
Sloshing as high as the knees of' pedestrians.
On the slippery pavements everyone passes brutal and self-absorbed,
Elliowing and spattering us with mud, or thrusting us aside
In their hurry to arrive somewhere.
Everywhere mire and dcluge and opacity of sky:
Dire tahleau such as dark Ezekiel might have dreamt.

The masses in Baudelaire. They stretch before the flaneur as a veil: they are the
newest drug for the solitary.-Second, they efface all traces of the individual:
they are the newest asylum for the reprobate and the proscript.-Finally, within
the labyrinth of the city, the masses are the newest and most inscrutable laby­
rinth. Through them, previously unknown chthonic traits are imprinted on the
image of the city.                                                               [M16,3]

The social base of flanerie is journalism. As fI,meur, the literary man ventures
into the marketplace to sell himself. Just so-but that by no means exhausts the
social side of flanerie. "We know;' says Marx, "that the value of each commodity
is determined by the quantity of labor materialized in its use value, by the
working-time socially necessary for its production" (Marx, DaJ KajJitai, ed.
Korsch <Berlin, 1932>, p. 188).551ne journalist, as flaneur, behaves as if he too
were aware of this. Ine number of work hours socially necessary for the produc­
tion of his particular working energy is, in fact, relatively high; insofar as he
makes it his business to let his hours ofleisure on the boulevard appear as part of
this work tinle, he multiplies the latter and thereby the value of his own labor. In
his eyes, and often also in the eyes of his bosses, such value has something
fantastic about it. Naturally, this would not be the case if he were not in the
privileged position of malcing the work time necessary for the production of his
use value available to a general and public review by passing that time on the
boulevard and thus, as it were, exhibiting it.                               [M16,4]

The press brings into play an overabundance of information, which can be all the
more provocative the more it is exempt from any use. (Only the ubiquity of the
reader would make possible a utilization; and so the illusion of such ubiquity is
also generated.) The actual relation of this information to social existence is
determined by the dependence of the information industry on financial interests
and its aligmnent with these interests.-As the information industry comes into
its own, intellectual labor fastens parasitically on every material labor, just as
capital more and more brings every material labor into a relation of dependency.

Simmel's apt remark concerning the uneasiness aroused in the urbanite by other
people, people whom, in the overwhelming majority of cases, he sees without

dispel this uneasiness and render it harmless. Otherwise, the fantastic pretensions
of these little volumes could not have sat well with their audience.        [M16a,2]

Prologue to Le Ffdneur, newspaper for the masses, published at the office of the
town crier, 45 Rue de la Harpe (the first and, no doubt, only number, dated May
3, 1848): "To go out strolling, these days, while puffing one's tobacco, . . . while
dreaming of evening pleasures, seems to us a century behind the times. We are
not the sort to refuse all knowledge of the customs of another age; but, in our
strolling, let us not forget our rights and our obligations as citizens. The times are
necessitous; they demand all our attention, all day long. Let us be flaneurs, but
patriotic flilneurs;' (J. Montaigu) . An early specimen of that dislocation of word

Apropos of F1aubert's remark that "observation is guided above all by imagina­
tion;'" the visionary faculty of Balzac: "It is important to note, first of all, that this
visionary power could never be exercised directly. Balzac did not have time to
live; . . . he did not have the leisure . . . to study men, after the fashion of Moliere
and Saint-Simon, through daily, familiar contact. He cut his existence in two,
writing by night, sleeping by day" (p. x). Balzac speaks of a "retrospective pene­
tration;' "It would seem t1mt he took hold of the givens of experience and then
tossed them, as it were, into a cmcible of dreams;' A. Cerfberr and J. Christophe,

Empathy with the commodity is fundamentally empathy with exchange value
itself. The flaneur is the virtuoso of this empathy. He takes the concept of market­
ability itself for a stroll. Just as his final ambit is the department store, his last
incarnation is the sandwich-man.                                                 [M17a,2]

Regarding the intoxication of empathy felt by the Hilneur, a great pa�sage from
F1aubert may be adduced. It could well date from the period of the composition
of Madame Bovary: "Today, for instance, as man and woman, both lover and
mistress, I rode in a forest on an autumn afternoon under the yellow leaves, and
I was also the horses, the leaves, the wind, the words my people uttered, even the
red sun that made them almost close their love-drowned eyes."" Cited in Henri
Grappin, "Le Mysticisme poetique <et l'inlagination> de Gustave Haubert;' Re­

On the intoxication of empathy felt by the Hilneur (and by Baudelaire as well) ,
this passage from F1aubert: "I see myself at different moments of history, very
clearly. . . . I was boatman on the Nile, lenD [procurer] in Rome at the tinle of the
Punic wars, then Greek rhetorician in Suburra, where I was devoured by bed­
bugs. I died, during the Crusades, from eating too many grapes on the beach in
Syria. I was pirate and monk, mountebank and coachman-perhaps Emperor of
the East, who knows?"" Grappin, "Le Mysticisme poetique <et l'imaginatiom de

illuminating for the conception of the crowd: in "Des Vetters Eckfenster" <My
Cousin's Corner Window>, the visitor still thinks that the cousin watches the
activity in the marketplace only because he enjoys the play of colors. And in the
long run, he thinks, this will surely become tiring. Similarly, and at around the
same time, Gogol writes, in "The Lost Letter;' of the annual faIT in Konotop:

Londres <Londou>

It is an immense place, and so spread out
That it takes a day to cross it by omnibus.
And, far and wide, there is nothing to see
But houses, public buildings, and high monuments,
Set down haphazardly by the haod of time.
Long black chimneys, the steeples of industry,
Open their mouths and exhale fumes
From their hot bellies to the open air;
Vast white domes and Gothic spires
Float in the vapor above the heaps of bricks.
An ever swelling, unapproachable river,
Rolling its muddy currents in sinuous onrush,
Like that frightful stream of the underworld,65
And arched over by gigaotic bridges on piers
That mimic the old Colossus of Rhodes,
Allows thousaods of ships to ply their way;
A great tide polluted and always unsettled
Recirculates the riches of the world.
Busy stockyards, open shops are ready
To receive a universe of goods.
Above, the sky tonnented, cloud upon cloud,
The sun, like a corpse, wears a sm'oud on its face,
Or, sometimes, in the poisonous atmosphere,
Looks out like a miner coal-blackened.
There, amid the somber mass of things,
An obscure people lives and dies in silence­
Millions of beings in thrall to a fatal instinct,
Seeking gold by avenues devious and straight.

To be compared witb Baudelarre's review of Barbie,; his portrayal ofMeryon, the
poems of I'Tableaux parisiens." In Barbier's poetry, two elements-the "descrip­
tion" of the great city and the social unrest-should be pretty much distin­
guished. Only traces of these elements still remain with Baudelaire, in whom
they have been joined to an altogether heterogeneous third element. Auguste
Barbie,; Iambes et poemes (paris, 1841), pp. 193-194. The poem is from the se­
quence Lazare of1837.                                                     [MI9a,l]


If one compares Baudelaire's discussion of Meryon with Barbier's "Londres,"
one asks oneself whether the gloomy linage of the "most disquietlllg of capi­
tals"66-the inlage, that is, of Paris-was not very materially determined by the
texts of Barbier and of Poe. London was certainly mead of Paris in industrial
development.                                                              [MI9a,2]
Beginning of Rousseau's Second Promenade: "Having therefore decided to de­
scribe my habitual state of mind in this, the strangest situation whicb any mortal
will ever know, I could think of no simpler or surer way of carrying out my plan
than to keep a faithful record of my solitary walks and the reveries that occupy
them, when I give free rein to my thoughts and let my ideas follow their natural
course, unrestricted and unconfined. These hours of solitude and meditation are
the only ones in the day when I am completely myself and my own master, with
nothing to distract or hinder me, the only ones when I can truly say that I am
what nature meant me to be." JeanJacques Rousseau, Les Reveries du promeneuT
solitaire; preceded by Dix Jours Ii Ermenonville, byJacques de Lacretelle (Paris,
1926), p. 15."'-The passage presents the integral link between contemplation
and idleness. What is decisive is that Rousseau already-in his idleness-is
enjoying himself, but has not yet accomplished the turning outward.            (M20,1]

··London Bridge." "A little while ago I was walldng across London Bridge and I

elbows . . . . Delight of vision held me with a ravenous thirst, involved in the play of
a light of inexhaustihle richness. But endlessly pacing and flowing at my back I was
aware of another river, a river of the blind eternally in pursuit of [its] immediate
material object. This seemed to me no crowd of individual beings, each with his
own history, his private god, his treasures and his scars, his interior monologue
and his fate; rather 1 made of it-unconsciously, in the depths of my body, in the
shaded places of my eyes-a flux of identical particles, equally sucked in by the
same nameless void, their deaf headlong current pattering monotonously over the
bridge. Never have I so felt solitude, mingled with pride and anguish." Paul

Basic to fianerie, among other things, is the idea that the fruits of iclleness are
more precious than the fruits of labor. The £laueur, as is well known, nlakes
"studies." On this subject, the uineteenth-century Larousse has the following to
say: "His eyes open, his ear ready, searching for something entirely different from
what the crowd gathers to see. A word dropped by chance will reveal to him one
of those cbaracter traits that carmot be invented and that must be drawn directly
from life; tl,ose physioguomies so naively attentive will furnish the painter with
the expression he was dreaming of; a noise, insignificant to every other ear, will
strike that of the musician and give him the cue for a harmonic combination;
even for the tbiuker, the philosopher lost in his reverie, this external agitation is
profitable: it stirs up his ideas as the storm stirs the waves of the sea . . . . Most
men of genius were great flaueurs-but industrious, productive £laneurs. . . .
Often it is when the artist and tl,e poet seem least occupied with their work that
they are most profoundly absorbed in it. In the first years of this century, a man
was seen walking each and every day-regardless of the weather, be it sunshine
or snow-around tl,e ramparts of the city of Vienna. This man was Beethoven,
who, in the midst of his wanderings, would work out his magnificent symphonies
in his head before putting them down on paper. For him , the world no longer
existed; in vain would people greet him respectfully as he passed. He saw noth·
ing; his mind was elsewhere." Pierre Larousse, Grand Dictionnaire universel (Paris

Description of the crowd in Proust: " All these people who paced np and down the
seawall promenade, tacking as violently as if it had been the deck of a ship (for
they could not lift a leg without at the same time waving their arms, turning their
heads and eyes, settling their shoulders, compensating by a balancing movement.
on one side for the movement they had just made on the other, and puffing out
their faces), and who, pretending not to see so as to let it he thought that they were
not interested, but covertly watching, for fear of running against the people who
were walking beside or coming towards them, did, in fact, butt into them, became
entangled with them, because each was mutually the object of the same secret
attention veiled beneath the same apparent disdain; their love-and consequently
their fear-of the crowd being one of the most powerful motives in all men,
whether they seek to please other people or to astonish them, or to show them that.
they despise them." Marcel Pronst, A COmbre des jeunes filles en .fleurs (Paris),

The critique of the Nouvelles Histoires extraordinaires which Armand de Pont·
martin publishes in Le Spectateur of September 19, 1857, contains a sentence that,
although aimed at the overall character of the book, would nevertheless have its
rightful place in an analysis of the "man of the crowd": "It was certainly there in
a striking form, that implacable democratic and American severity, reckoning
human beings as no more than numbers, ordy to end by attributing to numbers
something of the life, aninlation, and spirit of the human being." But doesn't the
sentence have a more immediate reference to the Histoires extraordinaires) which
appeared earlier? (And where is "the man of the crowd"?) Baudelaire, Oeuvres

The "spirit of noctambulism" finds a place in Proust (under a different name) :
"The capricious spirit that sometimes leads a woman of high rank to say to
herself 'What fun it will be!' and then to end her evening in a deadly tiresome
manner, getting up enough energy to go and rouse someone, remain a while by
the bedside in her evening wrap, and finally, finding nothing to say and noticing
that it is very late, go home to bed." Marcel Proust, Le Temps retrouv! (Paris), vol.

The most characteristic building projects of the nineteenth century-railroad
stations, exhibition halls, department stores (according to Giedion)-a11 have
matters of collective importance as their object. The fliilleur feels drawn to these
"despised, everyday" structures, as Giedion calls them. In these constructions,
the appearance of great masses on the stage of history was already foreseen.
They form the eccentric frame within which the last privateers so readily dis·
played themselves. (See Kia,S.)                                            [M21a,2]

These notes devoted to the Paris arcades were begun under an open sky of
cloudless blue that arched above the foliage; and yet-owing to the millions of
leaves that were visited by the fresh breeze of diligence, the stertorous breath of
the researcher, the storm of youthful zeal, and the idle wind of curiosity-they've
been covered with the dust of centuries. For the painted sky of sunnner that looks

Delimitation of the tendency of this project with respect to Aragon: whereas
Aragon persists within the realm of dream, here the concern is to find the constel­

namely the "mythology" (and this impressionism must be held responsible for
the many vague philosophemes in his book),' here it is a question of the dissolu­
tion of "mythology" into the space of history. That, of course, can happen only
through the awakening of a not-yet-conscious knowledge of what has been.

"Apart from a certain haul-goul charm;' says Giedion, "the artistic draperies and

Giedion, Bauen in Frankreich (Leipzig and Berlin <1928» , p. 3 . We, however,
believe that the marm they exercise on us is proof that these things, too, contain
material of vital importance for us-not indeed for our building practice, as is the
case with the constructive possibilities inherent in iron frameworks, bnt rather for
onr understanding, for the radioscopy, if you will, of the situation of the bour­
geois class at the moment it evinces the first signs of decline. In any case, material
of vital importance politically; this is demonstrated by the attachment of the
Surrealists to these things, as much as by their exploitation in contemporary
fashion. In other words : just as Giedion teaches us to read off the basic features of
today's architecture in the buildings erected around 1850, we, in tum, wonld
recognize today's life, today's forms, in the life and in the apparently secondary,
lost forms of that epoch.                                                      [Nl,ll ]

but sturdy scaffolding-a philosophic structure-in order to draw the most vital
aspects of the past into his net. But just as the magnificent vistas of the city
provided by the new construction in iron (again, see Giedion, illustrations on
pp. 61-63) for a long time were reserved exclusively for the workers and engi­
neers, so too the philosopher who wishes here to garner fresh perspectives must
be someone immune to vertigo-an independent and, if need be, solitary worker.

The book on the Baroque exposed the seventeenth century to the light of the
present day. Here, something analogous must be done for the nineteenth century,

Modest methodological proposal for the cultural-historical dialectic. It is very
easy to establish oppositions, according to determinate points of view, widlin the
various "fields') of any epoch, such that on one side lies the "productive," '"for�
ward-looking;' "lively;' "positive" part of the epoch, and on the other side the
ahortive, retrograde, and obsolescent. The very contours of the positive element
will appear distincdy only insofar as this element is set off against the negative.
On the other hand, every negation has its value solely as background for the
delineation of the lively, the positive. It is therefore of decisive importance that a
new partition be applied to this initially excluded, negative component so that, by
a displacement of the angle of vision (but not of the criteria!), a positive element
emerges anew in it too-something different from that previously signified. And
so on, ad infinitum, until the entire past is brought into the present in a historical
apocatastasis."                                                                 [N!a,3]

Against the prognosticators of decline. Consider, though: Isn't it an affront to

poem Faust and the film Faust? Yes, certainly. But, again, isn't there a whole world
of difference between a bad film of Faust and a good one? What matter are never
the "great" but only the dialectical contrasts, which often seem indistinguishable
from nu,mces. It is nonetheless from them that life is always born anew.

Marx lays bare the causal connection between economy and culture. For us, what
matters is the thread of expression. It is not the economic origins of culture that
will be presented, but the expression of the economy in its culture. At issue, in
other words, is the attempt to grasp an economic process as perceptible Vi·­
phenomenon, from out of which proceed all manifestations oflife in the arcades

This research-which deals fundamentally with the expressive character of the
earliest industrial products, the earliest industrial architecture, the earliest ma­
chines, but also the earliest departnlent stores, advertisenlents, and so on-thus
becomes important for Marxism in two ways. First, it will demonstrate how the
milieu in which Marx's doctrine arose affected that doctrine through its expres­
sive character (which is to say, not only through causal connections) ; but, second,
it will also show in what respects Marxism, too, shares the expressive character of
the material products contemporary with it.                                 [Nla,7]

Bear in mind that commentary on a reality (for it is a question here of commen­

It may be considered one of the methodological objectives of this work to demon­
strate a historical materialism which has annihilated within itself the idea of
progress. Just here, historical materialism has every reason to distinguish itself
sharply from bourgeois habits of thought. Its founding concept is not progress

Historical "understanding" is to be grasped, in principle, as an afterlife of that

A central problem of historical materialism that ought to be seen in the end: Must
the Marxist understanding of history necessarily be acquired at the expense of
the perceptibility of history? Or: in what way is it possible to conjoin a height­
ened graphicness <Anschaulichkeit> to the realization of the Marxist method? The
first stage in this undertal<ing will be to carry over the principle of montage into
history. That is, to assemble large-scale constructions out of the smallest and
most precisely cut components. Indeed, to discover in the analysis of the small
individual moment the crystal of the total event. And, therefore, to break with
vulgar historical naturalism. To grasp the construction of history as such. In the

A Kierkegaard citation in Wiesengrund � with conunentary following: "'One may
arrive at a similar consideration of the mythical by beginning with the imagistic.
When, in an age of reflection, one sees the imagistic protrude ever so slightly and
unobserved in a reflective representation and, like an antediluvian fossil, suggest
another species of existence which washed away doubt, one will perhaps be
amazed that the image could ever have played such an important role. '
Kierkegaard wards off the 'amazement' with what follows. Yet this amazement
heralds the deepest insight into the interrelation of dialectic, myth, and image. For
it is not as the continuously living and present that nature prevails in the dialectic.
Dialect.ic comes to a stop in the image, and, in the context. of recent history, it cites
the mythical as what is long gone: nature as primal history. For this reason, the
images-which, like those of the inttkienr, bring dialectic and myth to the point of
indifferentiation-are truly �ant.ediluvian fossils. ' They may be called dialectical
images, to use Benjamin's expression, whose compelling definition of �allegory'
also holds true for Kierkegaard's allegorical intention taken as a figure of histori­
cal dialectic and mythical nature. According to this definition, �in allegory the
observer is confronted with thefacies hippocratica of history, a petrified primor­
dial landscape. '" Theodor Wiesengrund-Adorno, Kierkegaard (Tiihingcn, 1933),

Only a thoughtless observer can deny that correspondences come into play
between the world of modem technology and the archaic symbol-world of my­
thology. Of course, initially the technologically new seems nothing more than
that. But in the very next childhood memory, its traits are already altered. Every
childhood achieves something great and irreplaceable for humanity. By the inter·
est it takes in technological phenomena, by the curiosity it displays before any
sort of invention or machinery, every childhood binds the accomplishments of
technology to the old worlds of symbol. There is nothing in the realm of nature
that from the outset would be exempt from such a bond. Only, it takes fonn not
in the aura of novelty but in the aura of the habitual. In memory, childhood, and
dream. 0 Awakening 0                                                        [N2a, 1]

The momentum of plimal history in the past is no longer masked, as it used to
be, by the tradition of church and family-this at once the consequence and
condition of technology. The old prehistoric dread already envelops the world of
our parents because we ourselves are nO longer bound to this world by tradition.
The perceptual worlds <Merkwelten> break up more rapidly; what they contain of
the mythic comes more quickly and more brutally to the fore; and a wholly
different perceptual world must be speedily set up to oppose it. This is how the
accelerated tempo of technology appears in light of the prinlal history of the
present. 0 Awakening 0                                                         [N2a,2]

It's not that what is past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its
light on what is past; rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together
in a flash with the now to form a constellation. In other words, image is dialectics
at a standstill. For while the relation of the present to the past is a purely tempo·
ral, continuous one, the relation of what·has·been to the now is dialectical: is not
progression but inlage, suddenly emergent.-Only dialectical images are genuine

In studying Simmel's presentation of Goethe's concept of truth,' I came to see
very clearly that my concept of origin in the Trauerspiel book is a rigorous and
decisive transposition of this basic Goethean concept from the domain of nature
to that of history. Origin-it is, in effect, the concept of Ur·phenomenon ex·
tracted from the pagan context of nature and brought into the Jewish contexts of
history. Now, in my work on the arcades I am equally concerned with fathoming
an origin. To be specific, I pursue the Ol�gin of the forms and mutations of the
Paris arcades from their beginning to their decline, and I locate this origin in the
economic facts. Seen from the standpoint of causality, however (and that means
considered as causes), these facts would not be prinlal phenomena; they become
such only insofar as in their own individual development-"unfolding" might be
a better term-they give rise to the whole series of the arcade's concrete histori·
cal forms, just as the leaf unfolds from itself all the riches of the empirical world
of plants.                                                                     [N2a,4]

What distinguishes inlages from the "essences" of phenomenology is their his·
torical index. (Heidegger seeks in vain to rescue history for phenomenology
abstractly through "historicity!')' These inlages are to be thought of entirely
apart from the categories of the "human sciences," from so-called habitus, fronl
style, and the like. For the historical index of the inlages not only says that they
belong to a particular time; it says, above all, that they attain to legibility only at
a particular tinle. And, indeed, this acceding " to legibility" constitutes a specific
critical point in the movement at their interior. Every present day is determined
by the images that are synchronic with it: each "now" is the now of a particular
recognizability. In it, truth is charged to the bursting point with time. (This point
of explosion, and nothing else, is the death of the intentia, which thus coincides
with the birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth.) It is not that what is
past casts its light on what is present, or what is present its light on what is past;
rather, image is that wherein what has been comes together in a flash with the
now to form a constellation. In other words: image is dialectics at a standstill. For
while the relation of the present to the past is purely temporal, the relation of
what-has-been to the now is dialectical: not temporal in nature but figural
<bildlich>. Only dialectical images are genuinely historical-that is, not archaic­
images. The image that is read-which is to say, the image in the now of its
recognizability-bears to the highest degree the imprint of the perilous critical
moment on which all reading is founded.                                          [N3, 1]

Resolute refusal of the concept of "timeless truth" is in order. Nevertheless, truth

understood to mean that forms of primal history are to be recovered among the
inventory of the nineteenth century. Only where the nineteenth century would
be presented as originary form of primal history-in a form, that is to say, in
which the whole of primal history groups itself anew in images appropriate to
that century-only there does the concept of a primal history of the nineteenth
century have meaning.                                                       [N3a,2]

Is awakening perhaps the synthesis of dream consciousness (as thesis) and wak­
ing consciousness (as antithesis) ? Then the moment of awakening would be
identical with the "now of recognizability;' in which things put on their true­
surrealist-face. Thus, in Proust, the importance of staking an entire life on life's
supremely dialectical point of rupture: awakening. Proust begins with an evoca­
tion of the space of someone waking up.                                     [N3a,3]

"If I insist on this mechanism of contradiction in the biography of a writer . . . , it
is because his train of thought cannot bypass certain facts which have a logic
different from that of his thought by itself. It is because there is no idea he adheres
to that truly holds up . . . in the face of certain very simple, elemental facts : that
workers are staring down the barrels of cannons aimed at them by police, that
war is threatening, and that fascism is already enthroned. . . . It behooves a man,
for the sake of his dignity, to submit his ideas to these facts, and not to bend these
facts, by some conjuring trick, to his ideas, however ingenious!' Aragon, "D'Al­
fred de Vigny it Avdeenko;' Commune, 2 (April 20, 1935), pp. 808-809. But it is
entirely possible that, in contradicting my past, I will establish a continuity with
that of another, which he in tum, as communist, will contradict. In this case, with
the past of Louis Aragon, who in this same essay disavows his Paysan de Paris:
''And, like most of my friends, I was partial to the failures, to what is monstrous
and cannot survive, carmot succeed. . . . I was like them: I preferred error to its
opposite" (p. 807).                                                              [N3a,4]

In the dialectical image, what has been within a particular epoch is always,
simultaneously, "what has been from time immemorial." As such, however, it is
manifest, on each occasion, only to a quite specific epoch-namely, the one in
which humanity, rubbing its eyes, recognizes just this particular dream image as
such. It is at this moment that the historian takes up, with regard to that image,
the task of dream interpretation.                                            [N4,1]

The expression "the book of nature" indicates that one can read the real like a

Raphael seeks to correct the Marxist conception of the normative character of
Greek art: "If the normative character of Greek art is . . . an explicable fact of
history, . . . we will have . . . to determine . . . what special conditions led to each
renascence and, in consequence, what special factors of . . . Greek art these
renascences adopted as models. For the totality of Greek art never possessed a
normative character; the renascences . . . have their own proper history. . . . Only
a historical analysis can indicate the era in which the abstract notion of a 'norm'
. . . of antiquity was born. . . . This notion was created solely by the Renais­
sance-that is, by prinlitive capitalism-and subsequently taken up by classicism,
which . . . conmlenced to assign it its place in a historical sequence. Marx has not
advanced along this way in the full measure of the possibilities of historical
materialism:' Max Raphael, Proudhon, Marx, Picasso (pal�s <1933» , pp. 178-179.

"Their love is boundless and sometimes too great, for they may devote themselves
to details with the delightful awkwardness of Albrecht Durer, or with the excessive
polish of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who does not conceal his art enough; and by this
minute detail they compromise the whole. We must not blame them too much. It is
. . . the luxuriance of their sap and vigor. . . . This sap wants to give everything at
once-leaves, fruit, and flowers; it bends and twists the branches. These defects of
many great workers are often found in my books, which lack their good qualities.

Letter from Wiesengrund o f August 5, 1 9 3 5 : "The attempt to reconcile your
'dream' momentum-as the subjective element in the dialectical image-with the
conception of the latter as model has led me to some formulations . . . : With the
vitiation of their use value, the alienated things are hollowed out and, as ciphers,
they draw in meanings. Subjectivity takes possession of them insofar as it invests
them with intentions of desire and feat: And insofar as defunct things stand in as
images of subjective intentions, these latter present themselves as immemorial
and eternal. Dialectical images are constellated between alienated things and
incoming and disappearing meaning, are instantiated in the moment of indiffer­
ence between death and meaning. WIllie things in appearance are awakened to
what is newest, death transfonns the meanings to what is most ancient." With
regard to these reflections, it should be kept in mind that, in the nineteenth
century, the number of "hollowed�out" things increases at a rate and on a scale
that was previously unknown, for technical progress is continually withdrawing
newly introduced objects from circulation.                                      [NS,2]

she carries a worn·out form to burial. The last stage of a world-historical form is
its comedy. The gods of Greece, who had already been mortally wounded in the
Prometheus Bound of Aeschylus, had to die yet again-this time a comic death-in
the dialogues of Lucian. Why does history follow this course? So that mankind

Engels in a letter to Mehring, July 14, 1893: "It is above all this semhlance of an

'overcome' the official Catholic religion, or Hegel 'overcomes' Fichte and Kant, or
Rousseau with his republican Contrat social indirectly 'overcomes' the constitu­
tional Montesquieu, this is a process which remains within theology, philosophy,
or political science, represents a stage in the history of these particular spheres of
thought and never passes heyond the sphere of thought. And since the hourgeois
illusion of the eternity and finality of capitalist production has been added to this,
even the overcoming of the mercantilists by the physiocrats and Adam Smith is
regarded as a sheer victory of thought; not as the reflection in thought of changed
economic facts, but as the finally achieved correct understanding of actual condi­
tions subsisting always and everywhere. " 19 Cited in Gustav Mayer, Friedrich

cannot look on history as anything other than a constellation of dangers which
he is always, as he follows its development in his thought, on the point of

It is important for the materialist historian, in the most rigorous way possible, to
differentiate the construction of a historical state of affairs from what one custom­

The fore- and after-history of a historical phenomenon show up in the phenome­

field in which the confrontation between its fore-history and after-history is
played out. It hecomes such a field insofar as the present instant interpenetrates it.
<See N7a, 8.> And thus the historical evidence polarizes into fore- and after-his­
tory always anew, never in the same way. And it does so at a distance from its
own existence, in the present instant itself-like a line which, divided according
to the Apollonian section," experiences its partition from outside itself.   [N7a,lJ

Historical materialism aspires to neither a homogeneous nor a continuous expo­
sition of history. From the fact that the superstructure reacts upon the base, it
follows that a homogeneous history, say, of economics exists as little as a homoge­
neous history of literature or of jurisprudence. On the other hand, since the
different epochs of the past are not all touched in the same degree by the present
day of the historian (and often the recent past is not touched at all; the present
fails to "do it justice"), continuity in the presentation of history is unattainable.

On the question of the incompleteness of history, Horkheimer's letter of March
16, 1937: "The determination of incompleteness is idealistic if completeness is
not comprised within it. Past injustice has occurred and is completed. The slain
are really slain . . . . If one takes tlle lack of closure entirely seriously, one must
believe in the LastJudgment. . . . Perhaps, with regard to incompleteness, there is
a difference between the positive and the negative, so that only the injustice, the
horror, the sufferings of the past are irreparable. The justice practiced, the joys,
the works, have a different relation to time, for their positive character is largely
negated by the transience of things. This holds first and foremost for individual
existence, in which it is not the happiness but the unllappiness that is sealed by
death." The corrective to this line of thinking may be found in the consideration
that history is not simply a science but also and not least a form of remembrance
<Eingedenken>. VVhat science has "determined;' remembrance can modify. Such
mindfulness can make the incomplete (happiness) into something complete, and
the complete (suffering) into something incomplete. That is theology; but in
remembrance we bave an experience that forbids us to conceive of history as
fundamentally atheological, little as it may be granted us to try to write it with
inm1ediately theological concepts.                                                 [N8,1]

The unequivocally regressive function which the doctrine of archaic images has

. . . elaboration of this original inlage into tlle finished work. By giving it shape,
the artist in some measure translates this image into the language of the pre­
sent. . . . Therein lies the social significance of art: . . . it conjures up the forms in
which the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age, is most lacking. The unsatisfied yearning
ofthe artist reaches back to the primordial image in the unconscious which is best
fitted to compensate the . . . one-sidedness of the spirit of the age. Tills image his
longing seizes on, and as he . . . brings it to consciousness, the image changes its
form until it can be accepted by the minds of his contemporaries, according to
their powers:' C. G. Jung, Seelenprobleme der Gegenwart (Zurich, Leipzig, and
Stuttgart, 1932), p. 71.24 Thus, the esoteric theory of art comes down to malcing
archetypes "accessible" to the "Zeitgeist."                                     (N8,2]

InJung's production there is a belated and particularly emphatic elaboration of
one of the elements which, as we can recognize today, were first disclosed in
explosive fashion by Expressionism. That element is a specifically clinical nihil­
ism, such as one encounters also in the works of Benn, and which has found a
camp follower in Celine. TIus nihilism is born of the shock imparted by the
interior of the body to those who treat it. Jung himself traces the heightened
interest in psychic life back to ExpressiOlusm. He writes: "Art has a way of
anticipating future changes in man's fundamental outlook, and expressionist art
has taken this subjective tum well in advance of the more general change." See
Seelenprobieme der Gegenwart (Zurich, Leipzig, and Stuttgart, 1932), p. 415-
"Das Seelenproblem des modemen Menschen")." In this regard, we should not
lose sight of the relations which Lukacs has established between Expressionism
and Fascism. (See also K7a,4.)                                            [N8a,l ]

Julien Benda, in Vi, Rigulier dans ie siede, cites a phrase from Fustel de Cou­
langes : "If you want to relive an epoch, forget that you know what has come after
it." That is the secret Magna Charta for the presentation of history by the
Historical School, and it carries little conviction when Benda adds: "Fustel never
said that these measures were valid for understanding the role of an epoch in
history."                                                                  [N8a,3]

Pursue the question of whether a connection exists between the secularization of
time in space and the allegorical mode of perception. The former, at any rate (as
becomes clear in Blanqui's last writing) , is hidden in the "worldview of the
natural sciences" of the second half of the century. (Secularization of history in
Heidegger.)"                                                               [N8a,4]

Goethe saw it coming: the crisis in bourgeois education. He confronts it in
Wilhelm Meister. He characterizes it in his correspondence with Zeiter. [N8a, 5]

WIlhelm von Humboldt shifts the center of gravity to langnages; Marx and
Engels shift it to the natural sciences. But the study of languages has economic
functions, too. It comes up against global economics, as the study of natural
sciences comes up against the production process.                          [N9,1]
Scientific method is distinguished by the fact that, in leading to new objects, it
develops new methods. Just as form in art is distinguished by the fact that,
opening up new contents, it develops new forms. It is only from without that a
work of art has one and only one form, that a treatise has one and only one
method.                                                                          [N9,2]

On the concept of "rescue": the wind of the absolute in the sails of the concept.
(The principle of the wind is the cyclical.) The trim of the sails is the relative.
[N9,3]

What are phenomena rescued from? Not only, and not in the main, from the
discredit and neglect into which they have fallen, but from the catastrophe repre­
sented very often by a certain strain in their dissemination, their I'enshrinement
as heritage;'-They are saved through the exhibition of the fissure within
them.-There is a tradition that is catastrophe.                                  [N9,4]

It is the inherent tendency of dialectical experience to dissipate the semblance of
eternal sameness, and even of repetition, in history. Authentic political experi­
ence is absolutely free of this semblance.                                       [N9,S]

What matters for the dialectician is to have the wind of world history in his sails.
Thinking means for him: setting the sails. What is important is how they are set.
Words are his sails. The way they are set makes them into concepts.              [N9,6]

The dialectical image is an image that emerges suddenly, in a flash. What has
been is to be held fast-as an image flashing up in the now of its recognizability.
The rescue that is carried out by these means-and only by these-can operate
solely for the sake of what in the next moment is already inetrievably lost. In this
connection, see the metaphorical passage from my introduction to Jochmaml,
concerning the prophetic gaze that catches fire from the summits of the past."
[N9,7]

Being a dialectician means having the wind of history in one's sails. The sails are
the concepts. It is not enough, however, to have sails at one's disposal. What is
decisive is knowing the art of setting them.                                     [N9,S]

The concept of progress must be grounded in the idea of catastrophe. That
things are "status quo" is the catastrophe. It is not an ever-present possibility but
what in each case is given. Thus Strindberg (in 10 Damascus?) :" hell is not
something that awaits us, but this life here and now.                           [N9a,1]

It is good to give materialist investigations a tmncated ending.                [N9a,2]

To the process of rescue belongs the finn, seemingly brutal grasp.              [N9a,3]
The dialectical image is that form of the historical object which satisfies Goethe's
requirements for the object of analysis: to exhibit a genuine synthesis. It is the
primal phenomenon of history.                                                [N9a,4]

The enshrinement or apologia is meant to cover up the revolutionary moments
io the occurrence of history. At heart, it seeks the establishment of a contiouity. It
sets store only by those elements of a work that have already emerged and played
a part in its reception. The places where tradition breaks off-hence its peaks and
crags, which offer footing to one who would cross over them-it misses.
[N9a,S]

Historical materialism must renounce the epic element io history. It blasts the
epoch out of the reified "continuity of history." But it also explodes the homoge­
neity of the epoch, ioterspersiog it with ruins-that is, with the present. [N9a,6]

In every true work of art there is a place where, for one who renloves there, it
blows cool like the wiod of a coming dawn. From tlns it follows that art, which
has often been considered refractory to every relation with progress, can provide
its true definition. Progress has its seat not io the continuity of elapsiog tio,e but
io its interferences-where the truly new makes itself felt for tl,e first time, witll
the sobriety of dawn.                                                          [N9a,7]

For the materialist historian, every epoch with which he occupies himself is only
prehistory for the epoch he himself must live io. And so, for him, there can be no
appearance of repetition io history, sioce precisely those moments io tl,e course
of history which matter most to him, by virtue of their index as "fore-history,"
become moments of the present day and change their specific character accord­
iog to the catastrophic or triumphant nature of that day.                   [N9a,8]

Scientific progress-like histOl�cal progress-is io each instance merely the first
step, never the second, third, or n + I-supposiog that these latter ever belonged
not just to the workshop of science but to its corpus. That, however, is not io fact
the case; for every stage in the dialectical process (like every stage io tl,e process
of history itself), conditioned as it always is by every stage precediog, bllligs ioto
play a fundamentally new tendency, which necessitates a fundamentally new
treatment. The dialectical method is thus distinguished by the fact that, io leading
to new objects, it develops new methods, just as form io art is distioguished by
the fact that it develops new forms io delioeatiog new contents. It is only from
without that a work of art has one and only one form, that a dialectical treatise has
one and only one method.                                                       [NIO,l]

Defmitions of basic historical concepts: Catastrophe-to have nnssed the oppor­
tulnty. Critical moment-the status quo tlneatens to be preserved. Progress-the
first revolutionary measure taken.                                       [NIO, 2]
If the object of history is to be blasted out of the continuum of historical succes­
sion, that is because its mouadological structure demands it. This structure first
comes to light in the exh'acted object itself. And it does so in the form of the
historical confrontation that makes up the interior (and, as it were, the bowels) of
the historical object, and into which all the forces and interests of history enter on
a reduced scale. It is owing to this monadological structure that the historical
object finds represented in its interior its own fore-history and after-history.
(Thus, for example, the fore-history of Baudelaire, as educed by current scholar­
ship, resides in allegory; his after-history, inJugendstil.)                    [NIO,3]

Forming the basis of the confrontation with conventional historiography and
"enshrinement" IS the polemic against empathy (Grillparzer, Fustel de Cou­
langes).                                                                        [NIO,4]

The Saint-Simonian Barrault distinguishes between epoques organiques and epo­
ques cn'tiques. <See U15a,4.> The derogation of the critical spirit begins directly
after the victory of the bourgeoisie in theJuly Revolution.                     [NIO,5]

The destructive or critical momentum of materialist historiography is registered
in that blasting of historical continuity with which the historical object first consti­
tutes itself. In fact, an object of history cannot be targeted at all within the
continuous elapse of history. And so, from time immemorial, historical narration
has simply picked out an object from this continuous succession. But it has done
so without foundation, as an expedient; and its first thought was then always to
reinsert the object into the continuum, which it would create anew tluough
empathy. Materialist historiography does not choose its objects arbitrarily. It
does not fasten on them but rather springs them loose from the order of succes­
sian. Its provisions are more extensive, its occurrences more essential.       [NIOa,l]

[For] the destructive momentmn in materialist historiography is to be conceived
as the reaction to a constellation of dangers, which tlueatens both the burden of
tradition and those who receive it. It is this constellation of dangers which the
materialist presentation of history comes to engage. In this constellation is com­
prised its actuality; against its tlueat, it must prove its presence of mind. Such a
presentation of history has as goal to pass, as Engels puts it, "beyond the sphere
of thought!""                                                                  [NIOa,2]

To thinking belongs the movement as well as the arrest of thoughts. Where
tlunking comes to a standstill in a constellation saturated with tensions-there
the dialectical image appears. It is the caesura in the movement of thought. Its
position is naturally not an arbitrary one. It is to be found, in a word, where the
tension between dialectical opposites is greatest. Hence, the object constructed in
the materialist presentation of history is itself the dialectical image. Tbe latter is
identical with the historical object; it justifies its violent expulsion from the con­
tinuum of historical process.                                                  [NIOa,3]
The archaic form of primal history, which has been summoned up in every
epoch and now once more by Jung, is that form which makes semblance in
history still more delusive by mandating nature as its homeland. [N1 1 , 1]

To write history means giving dates their physiognomy.                        [Nl l,2]

The events surrounding the historian, and in which he himself takes part, will
underlie his presentation in the form of a text wl�tten in invisible ink. The history
which he lays before the reader comprises, as it were, the citations occurring in
this text, and it is only these citations that occur in a manner legible to all. To
write history thus means to cite history. It belongs to the concept of citation,
howevel; that the historical object in each case is tom from its context.     [NII,3J

On the elementary doctl�ne of historical materialism. (1) An object of history is
that through which knowledge is constituted as the object's rescue. (2) History
decays into images, not into stories. (3) Wherever a dialectical process is realized,
we are dealing with a monad. (4) The materialist presentation of history carries
along with it an immanent critique of the concept of progress. (5) Historical
materialism bases its procedures on long experience, common sense, presence of
mind, and dialectics. (On the monad: NI0a,3.)                                [N11,4]

"The regions which were the first to become enlightened are not those where the
sciences have made the greatest progress:' Turgot, Oeuvres, vol. 2 (Paris, 1844),
pp. 601-602 ("Second discours sur les progres successifs de l'esprit humain").""
The thought is taken up in the later literature, and also in Marx.        [Nll, 7J

In the course of the nineteenth century, as the bourgeoisie consolidated its posi­
tions of power, el,e concept of progress would increasingly have forfeited the
critical functions it originally possessed. (In this process, the doctrine of natural
selection had a decisive role to play: it popularized the notion that progress was
automatic. The extension of the concept of progress to the whole of human
activity was furthered as a result.) With Ttlrgot, the concept of progr·ess still had
its critical functions. In particular, the concept made it possible to direct people's
attention to retrograde tendencies in history. 1urgot saw progress, charac­
teristically, as guaranteed above all in the realm of mathematical research.
[Nlla,IJ

""But what a spectacle the succession of men's opinions presents! There I seek the
progress of the human mind, and I find virtually nothing hut t.he history of its
errors. Why is its course-which is so sure, from the very first steps, in the field of
mathematical studies-so unsteady in everything else, and so apt to go astray? . . .
In this slow progression of opinions and errors, . . . I fancy that I see those first
leaves, those sheaths which nature has given to the newly growing stems of plants,
issuing before them from the earth, and withering one by one as other sheaths
come into existence, until at last the stem itself makes its appearance and
is crowned with flowers and fruit-a symbol of late-emerging truth." Turgot,
Oeuvres, vol. 2 (Paris, 1844,), pp. 600-601 ('�Second discours sur les progres suc­
cessifs de l'esprit humain" ). :11                                          [Nlla)2]

A limes to progress still exists in Turgot: "In later times, . . . it was necessary for
them, through reflection, to take themselves back to where the first men had been
led by blind instinct. And who is not aware that it is here that the supreme effort
of reason lies?" Turgot, Oeuvres, vol. 2, p. 610." llis limit is still present in Marx;
later it is lost.                                                               [Nlla,3]

Already with Turgot it is evident that the concept of progress is oriented toward
science, but has its corrective in art. (At bottom, not even art can be ranged
exclusively under the concept of regression; neither does Jochmann's essay de­
velop this concept in an unqualified way.) Of course, Turgot's estimate of art is
different from what ours would be today. "Knowledge of nature and of truth is as
infinite as they are; the arts, whose aim is to please us, are as limited as we are.
Tnne constantly brings to light new discoveries in the sciences; but poetry, paint­
ing, and music have a fixed limit which the genius of languages, the imitation of
nature, and the limited sensibility of our organs determine. . . . The great men of
the Augustan age reached it, and are still our models." Turgot, Oeuvres, vol. 2
(paris, 1844), pp. 605-606 ("Second discours sur les progres successifs de l'esprit
humain"}.33 Thus a progrannnatic renunciation of originality in art!         [N12, 1 ]

��There are elements of the arts of taste which could be perfected with time-for
example, perspective, which depends on optics. But local color, the imitation of
nature, and the expression of the passions are of all times." Turgot, Oewvres, vol.
2 (Paris, 1844) , p. 658 (,"Plan clu second cliscours sur Phistoire universelle").H
[N12,2]

Militant representation of progress: "It is not error that is opposed to the progress
of truth; it is indolence, obstinacy, the spirit of routine, everything that contrib­
utes to inaction.-The progress of even the most peaceful of arts among tl,e
ancient peoples of Greece and their republics was punctuated by continual wars.
It was like theJews' building the walls ofJerusalem with one hand while defend­
ing them with the other. Their spirits were always in fernlent, tl,eir hearts always
high with adventure; and each day was a further enlightenment." lurgot,
Oeuvres, vol. 2 (Paris, 1844), pp. 672 ("Pensees et fragments").              [N12,3]

Presence of mind as a political category comes magnificently to life in these
words of Turgot: "Before we have learned to deal with iliings in a given position,
they have already changed several times. Thus, we always perceive events too
late, and politics always needs to foresee, so to speak, the present;' Turgot,
Oeuvres, vol. 2 (Paris, 1844), p. 673 ("Pensees et fragments")."               [N12a,1]

"The . . . radically altered landscape of the nineteenth century remains visible to

In all their singularity, these things announce that nature has not withdrawn, amid
the triumph of technological civilization, into the nameless and inchoate, that the
pure construction of bridge or tunnel did not in itself . . . usurp the landscape, hut
that river and mountain at once took their side, and not as subjugated adversaries
but as friendly powers . . . . The iron iocomotive that disappears into the mountain

The concept of progress had to run counter to the critical theory of history from
the moment it ceased to b e applied as a criterion to specific historical develop­
ments and instead was required to measure the span between a legendary incep­
tion and a legendary end of history. In other words: as soon as it becomes the
signature of historical process as a whole, the concept of progress bespeaks an
uncritical hypostatization rather than a critical interrogation. This latter may be
recognized, in the concrete exposition of history, from the fact that it outlines
regression at least as sharply as it brings any progress into view. (Thus Turgot,
Jochmann.)                                                                      [N13,1]

Lotze as critic of the concept of progress: "In opposition to the readily accepted
doctrine that the progress of humanity is ever onward and upward, more cau­
tious reflection has been forced to make the discovery that the course of history
takes the form of spirals-some prefer to say epicycloids. In short, there has
never been a dearth of thoughtful but veiled acknowledgnlents that the impres­
sion produced by history on the whole, far from being one of unalloyed exulta­
tion, is preponderantly melancholy. Unprejudiced consideration will always
lanlent and wonder to see how many advantages of civilization and special
charms of life are lost, never to reappear in their integrity;' Hermann Lotze,
Mikrokosmos, vol. 3 (Leipzig, 1864), p. 2 1 .36                                 [N13,2]

Lotze as critic of the concept of progress: "It is not . . . clear how we are to
imagine one course of education as applying to successive generations of men,
allowing the later of these to partake of the fruits produced by the unrewarded
efforts and often by the misery of those who went before. To hold that the claims
of particular times and individual men may be scorned and all their misfortunes
disregarded if only mankind would improve overall is, though suggested by
noble feelings, merely enthusiastic thoughtlessness. . . . Nothing is progress
which does not mean an increase of happiness and perfection for those very souls
which had suffered in a previous imperfect state;' Hermann Lotze, MikrokoJmoJ,
vol. 3 (Leipzig, 1864), p. 23.37 If the idea of progress extended over the totality of
recorded history is something peculiar to the satiated bourgeoisie, then Lotze
represents the reserves called up by those on the defensive. But contrast Holder­
lin: "I love the race of men who are coming in the next centuries!'38         [N13,3]

A thought-provoking observation: "It is one of the most noteworthy peculiarities
of the human heart . . . clmt so much selfishness in individuals coexists with the
general lack of envy which every present day feels toward its future." This lack of
envy indicates that the idea we have of happiness is deeply colored by the time in
which we live. Happiness for us is thinkable only in the air that we have
breathed, among the people who have lived with us. In other words, there
vibrates in the idea of happiness (this is what that noteworthy circumstance
teaches us) the idea of salvation. This happiness is founded on the very despair
and desolation which were ours. Our life, it can be said, is a muscle strong
enough to contract the whole of historical time. Or, to put it differencly, the
genuine conception of historical time rests entirely upon the image of redemp­
tion. (The passage is from Lotze, MikrokoJmoJ, vol. 3 [Leipzig, 1864], p. 49.)39
[N13a,1]

Denial of the notion of progress in the religious view of history: "History, how­
ever it may move forward or fluctuate hither and thither, could not by any of its
movements attain a goal lying out of its own plane. And we may spare ourselves
the trouble of seeking to find, in mere onward movement upon this plane, a
progress which history is destined to make not there but by an upward move­
ment at each individual point of its course forward." Hermann Lotze, MikrokoJ­
mas, vol. 3 (Leipzig, 1864), p. 49 :10                                    [N13a,2]

Connection, in Lotze, between the idea of progress and the idea of redemption:
"The reason of the world would be turned to umeason if we did not reject the
thonght that the work of vanishing generations should go on forever benefiting
only those who come later, and being irreparably wasted for the workers them­
selves" (p. 50). This cannot be, "unless the world itself, and all the flourish about
historical development, are to appear as mere vain and unintelligible noise . . . .
1'bat in some mysterious way the progress of history affects them, too-it is this
conviction that first enticles us to speak as we do of humanity and its history"
(p. 51). Lotze calls this the "thought of the preservation and restoration of all
things" (p. 52)."                                                             [N13a,3]

Cultural history, according to Bernheim, developed out of the positivism of
Comte; Beloch's Greek History « vol. 1,> 2nd edition, 1912) is, according to him, a
textbook example of Comtean influence. Positivist historiography "disregarded
. . . the state and political processes, and saw in the collective intellectual develop­
ment of society the sole content of history. . . . The elevation . . . of cultural
history to the only subject worthy of historical research!" Ernst Bernheim, Mit-

'''The logical category of time does not govern the verb as much as one might
expect.' Strange as it may seem, the expression of the future does not appear to be

a complicated expression without parallel to that of the present or the past.' . . .

Simmel touches on a very important matter with the distinction between the
concept of culture and the spheres of autonomy in classical Idealism. The separa­
tion of the three autonomous domains from one another preserved classical
Idealism from the concept of culture that has so favored the cause of barbarism.
Simmel says of the cultural ideal: "It is essential that the independent values of
aesthetic, scientific, ethical, . . . and even religious achievements be transcended,
so that they can alI be integrated as elements in the development of human
nature beyond its natural state." Georg Simmel, Philosophie des Geldes (Leipzig,
1900), pp. 476-477.42                                                              [N14,3]


·''There has never been a period of history in which the culture peculiar to it has

with cultured refinement of life . . . and free participation in the benefits of civil
order." Hermann Lotze, Mik,.okosmos, vol. 3 (Leipzig, 1864), pp. 23-24.4:1
[NI4a,l]


To the view that "there is progress enough if, . . . while the mass of mankind
remains mired in an uncivilized condition, the civilization of a small minority is
constantly struggling upward to greater and greater heights," Lotze responds with
the question: "How, upon such assumptions, can we be entitled to speak of one
history of mankind?" Lotze, Mikrokosmos, vol. 3, p. 25. ,14              [N14a,2]


"The way in which the culture of' past times is for the most part handed down,"
Lotze says, " leads directly hack to the very opposite of that at which historical
development should aim; it leads, that is, to the formation of an instinct of culture,
which continually takes up more and more of the elements of civilization, thus
making them a lifeless possession, and withdrawing them from the sphere of that
conscious activity hy the efforts of which they were at first obtained" (p. 28).
Accordingly: " The progress of science is not . . . , directly, human progress; it
would be this if, in proportion to the increase in accumulated truths, there were
also an increase in men's concern for them . . . and in the clearness of their insight
concerning them.?' Lotze, Mikro/cosnws. vol. 3, p. 29 . �s

Lotze on humanity: "'It cannot be said that men grow to what they are with a
consciousness of this growth, and with an accompanying remembrance of their
previous condition." Lotze, Milcrokosnws, vol. 3, p. 31.46          [N14a,4]

Lotze's vision of history can be related to Stifter's: "that the unruly will of the
individual is always restricted in its action by universal conditions not subject to
arbitrary will-conditions which are to be found in the laws of spiritual life in
general, in the established order of nature . . . " Lotze, Mikrokosmos, vol. 3, p. 34:"

A phrase which Baudelaire coins for the consciousness of time peculiar to some­
one intoxicated by hashish can be applied in the definition of a revolutionary
historical consciousness. He speaks of a night in which he was absorbed by the
effects of hashish: "Long though it seemed to have been . . . , yet it also seemed to
have lasted only a few seconds, or even to have had no place in all eternity."

At any given time, the living see themselves in the midday of history. They are
obliged to prepare a banquet for the past. The historian is the herald who invites
the dead to the table.                                                         [N15,2]

On the dietetics of historical literature. The contemporary who learns from
books of history to recognize how long his present misery has been in prepara­
tion (and this is what the historian must inwardly aim to show him) acquires
thereby a high opinion of his own powers. A history that provides this kind of
mstnlction does not cause hun sorrow, but arms him. Nor does such a history
arise from sorrow, unlike that which Haubert had in mind when he penned the
confession: "Few will suspect how depressed one had to be to undertake the
resuscitation of Carthage."·19 It is pure curiositi that arises from and deepens
sorrow.                                                                        [N15,3]

Exanlple of a "cultural historical" perspective ill the WOTse sense. Huizinga
speaks of the consideration displayed for the life of the conunon people in the
pastorals of the late Middle Ages. "Here, too, belongs that interest in rags and
tatters which . . . is already beginning to make itself felt. Calendar miniatures
note with pleasure the threadbare knees of reapers in the field, while paintings
accentuate the rags of mendicants . . . . Here begins the line that leads through
Rembrandt's etchings and Murillo's beggar boys to the street types of Steinlen:'

"The past has left images of itself in literary texts, images comparahle to those
which are imprinted by light on a photosensitive plate. The future alone possesses
developers active enough to scan such surfaces perfectly. Many pages in Marivaux

could not fully have deciphered." Andre Monglond, l�e Preronwntismefrmu;a.is,

A revealing vision of progress in Hugo, "Paris incendie" (L'Annie terrible) :

What! Sacrifice everything! Even the gTanary!

On the style one should strive for : "It is through everyday words that style bites
into and penetrates the reader. It is through them that great thoughts circulate
and are accepted as genuine, like gold or silver imprinted with a recognized seal.
They inspire confidence in the person who uses them to make his thoughts more
understandable; for one recognizes by such usage of common language a man
who knows life and the world, and who stays in touch with things. Moreover,
these words make for a frank style. They show that the author has long rumi·
nated the thought or the feeling expressed, that he has made them so much his
own, so llluch a nlatter of habit, that for hUll the most common expressions
suffice to express ideas that have become natural to him after long deliberation.
In the end, what one says in this way will appear more truthful, for nothing is so
clear, when it COlues to words, than those we call familiar; and clarity is some­
thing so characteristic of the truth that it is often confused with it!' Nothing more
subtle than the suggestion: be clear so as to have at least the appearance of truth.
Offered in this way, the advice to write simply-which usually harbors resent­
ment-has the highest authority. J. Joubert, Oeuvres (Paris, 1883), vol. 2 , p . 293
("Du Style;' no. 99).                                                        [N15a,3]


The person who could develop the Joubertian dialectic of precepts would pro­
duce a stylistics worth mentioning. For example, Joubert recommends the use of
"everyday words)) but warns against "colloquial language," which "expresses
things relevant to our present customs only" ("Du Style," no. 67 < Oeuvres) vol. 2,
p. 286» .                                                                       [N16,1]


""AU heautiful expressions are susceptible of more than one meaning. When a

should be adopted." J. Joubert, Oeuvres (Paris, 1883), vol. 2, p. 276 ("Du Style,"

With regard to political economy, Marx characterizes as "its vulgar element"
above all "that elenlent in it which is mere reproduction-that is, representation
of appearance:' Cited in Korsch, Karl Marx <manuscript>, vol. 2, p. 22.51 Tills
vulgar element is to be denounced in other sciences as well.                    [N16,3]

Concept of nature in Marx: "If in Hegel . . . �physical nature likewise encroaches
on world history,' then Marx conceives nature from the beginning in social catego­
ries. Physical nature does not enter direclly into world history; rather, it enters
indirectly, as a process of material production that goes on, from the earliest
moment, not only between man and nature but also between man and man. Or, to
use language that will be clear to philosophers as well: in Marx '8 rigorously social
science, that pure nature presupposed by all human activity (the economic na,tura
naturans) is replaced everywhere by nature as material production (the economic
natura naturata) that is, by a social �matter� mediated and transformed
-



through human social activity, and thus at the same time capable of further change
and modification in the present and the future.'� Korsch, Karl Marx, vol. 3, p. 3.;;2
[N16,4]

Korsch provides the following reformulation of the Hegelian triad in Marxian
terms: ��The Hegelian �contradiction' was replaced by the struggle of the social
classes; the dialectical 'negation,' by the proletariat; and the dialectical 'synthe­
sis � ' by the proletarian revolution." Korsch, Kar·l Marx, vol. 3 , p . 45. �:) [N16,5]

Restriction of the materialist conception of history in Korsch: ��As the material
mode of production changes, so does the system of mediations existing between the
material base and its political and juridical superstructure, with its corresponding
social forms of consciousness. Hence, the general propositions ofmatel'ialist social
theory concerning the relations between economy and politics or economy and
ideology, or concerning such general concepts as class and class su"uggle, " . . have
a different meaning for each specific epoch and, strictly speaking, are valid, in the
particular form Marx gave them within the present bourgeois society, only for this
society. " . . Only for contemporary bourgeois society, where the spheres of econ­
omy and politics are formally and entirely separated from each other, and where
workers as citizens of the state are free and possessed of equal rights, does the
scientific demonstration of their actual ongoing lack of freedom in the economic
sphere have the character of a theoretical discovery." Korsch, vol. 3, pp. 21-22.
[N16a,1]

Korsch makes �'the seemingly paradoxical observation (which is nonetheless . . .
suited to the final and most mature form of Marxian science) that in the materialist
social theory of Marx the ensemhle of sodal relations, which hourgeois sociologists
treat as an independent domain . . . , already is investigated aceording to its objec-
tive . . , content hy the historical and social science of economics . . . . In this sense,
Marx � materiali.st social science is not sociology but economics. Korsth, Karl

A citation from Marx on the mutahility of nature (in Korsch, Karl Marx, vol. 3 ,
p. 9): "Even the naturally grown variations of the human species, such a s differ­
ences of race, . . . can and must be abolished in the historical process. "55
[N16a,3]

Doctrine of the superstructure, according to Korsch: ��Neither 'dialectical causal­
ity' in its philosophic definition, nor scientific 'causality' supplemented by �inter­
actions,' is sufflcient to determine the particular kinds of connections and
relations existing hetween the economic 'base' and the juridical and political 'su­
perstructure . . . " together with the 'corresponding' forms of consciousness . . . .
Twentieth-century natural science has learned that the 'eausal' relations which
the researcher in a given field has to estahlish for that field cannot he defined in
terms of a general concept or law of causality, but must he determined specifically
for each separate field. * [*See Philipp Frank, Das Kmtsalgesetz und seine Gren­
zen <The Law of Causality and Its Limits> (Vienna, 1932). ] . . . The greater part of
the results . . . obtained by Marx and Engels consist not in theoretical formula­
tions of the new principle hut in its specific applieation to a series of , . , questions,
which are either of fundamental practical importance or of an extremely suhtle
nature theoretically. , . . * [*Here, for example, belong the questions raised by
Marx at the end of the 1857 �Introduction' <to the Gru,ndrisse> (pp, 779ff.), and
which concern the "unequal development' of different spheres of social life: un­
equal development of material production vis-a.-vis artistic production (and of the
various arts among themselves), the level of edutation in the United States as
compared to that of Europe, unequal development of the relations of production
as legal relations, and so forth. ] The more pl'ecise scientific determination of the
present contexts is still a task for the future . . . , a task whose center will lie, once
again, not in theoretical formulation but in the fUi·ther application and testing of
the principles implicit in Marx's work. Nor should we adhere too strictly to the
words of Marx, who often used his terms only figuratively-as, for instance, in
describing the connections under eonsideration here as a relation between �base'
and 'superstructure,' as a 'correspondence,' and so on. , . . In all these cases, the
Marxian concepts (as Sorel and Lenin, among the later Marxists, understood best)
are not intended as new dogmatic fetters, as preestablished conditions which must
be met in some particular order by any 'materialist' investigation, They are,
rather, a wholly undogmatic guide to research and action." Korseh, Karl Marx
(manuscript), vol. 3 , pp. 93-96."                                                   [N17]

Materialist eonception of history and materialist philosophy: '�The formulas of
materialist history that were applied by Marx and Engels . . . solely to the . . .
investigation of' bourgeois society, and transferred to other historical periods only
with suitable elaboration, have been detached by the Marxist epigones from this
specific application, and in general from every historical connection; and out of
so-called historical materialism they have made a universal . . . sociological the­
ory. From this . . . leveling . . . of materialist theory of society, it was only a step to
the idea that once again today-or especially today-it was necessary to shore up
the historical and economic science of Marx, not only with a general social philoso­
phy but even with a . . . universal materialist worldview embracing the totality of
nature and society. Thus, the . . . scientific forms into which the real kernel of
eighteenth-century philosophical materialism had evolved . . . were ultimately
carried back to what Marx himself had once unmistakably repudiated as 'the
philosophical phrases of the Materialists about matter. ' Materialist social science
. . . does not need . . . any such philosophic support. This most important advance
. . . carried out by Marx was later overlooked even by . . . 'orthodox' interpreters
of Marx . . . . They have thus reintroduced their own backward attitudes into a
theory which Marx had consciously transformed from a philosophy into a science.
It is the almost grotesque historical fate of the Marx-orthodoxy that, in repulsing
the attacks of' revisionists, it ultimately arrives, on all important issues, at the very
same standpoint as that taken by its adversaries. For example, the leading repre­
sentative of' this school, . . . Plekhanov, in his eager pursuit of that 'philosophy'
which might be the true foundation of Marxism, finally hit upon the idea of pre­
senting Marxism as 'a form of Spinoza's philosophy freed by Feuerbach of its
theological addendum. '" Korsch, Karl Marx (manuscript), vol. 3, pp. 29-31 Y

Korsch cites Bacon, from the Novum Organum: ·"Recte enim veritas temporis
{ilia dicitur non auctoritas . ' On that authority of' all authorities, time, he had
based the superiority of the new bourgeois empirical science over the dogmatic
science of the Middle Ages." Korsch, Karl Marx (manuscript), vol. 1 , p . 72. 511

"For the positive use, Marx replaces the overweening postulate of Hegel that the
truth must be concrete with the rational principle of specification . . . . The real
interest lies . . . in the specific traits through which each particular historical
society is distinguished from the common features of society in general and in
which, therefore, its development is comprised . . . . In the same manner, an exact
social science cannot form its general concepts by simply abstracting from some
and retaining other more or less arbitrarily chosen characteristics of the given
historical form of bourgeois society. It can secure the knowledge of the general
contained in that particular form of society only by the minute investigation of all
the historical conditions underlying its emergence from another state of society
and from the actual modification of its present form under exactly established
conditions . . . . Thus, the only genuine laws in social science are laws of develop­
ment." Korsch, Karl Marx (manuscript), vol. 1, pp. 49-52. 59                  [N18,2]

In his characterization of Leopardi, Sainte-Beuve declares himself "persuaded . . .
that the full value and originality of literary criticism depends on its applying
itself to subjects for which we have long possessed the background and all the
immediate and more distant contexts," C.-A. Sainte-Beuve, Portraits contempo­
rains, vol. 4 (paris, 1882), p. 365. On the other hand, it must be admitted that the
absence of certain of the conditions demanded here by Sainte-Beuve can have its
value. A lack of feeling for the most delicate nuances of the text can itself cause
the reader to inquire more attentively into the least of facts within the social
relations underlying the work of art. Moreover, the inseusitivity to fine shades of
meaning can more readily procure for one (thanks to clearer apprehension of the
contours of the work) a certain superiority to other critics, insofar as the feeling
for nuances does not always go together with the gift for analysis.        [NI8a,I]

Critical remarks on technical progress show up quite early. The author of the
treatise On Art (Hippocrates?) : "I believe that the inclination . . . of intelligence is

have discovered them than not to have done so at all." Leonardo da Vmci: "How and
why I do not write of my method of going underwater for as long as I can remain
there without eating: if I neither publish nor divulge this information, it is be­
cause of the wickedness of men who would avail themselves of it to commit
murder at the bottom of the sea-by staving in ships and sinking them with their
crews;' Bacon: "In . . The New Atlantis, . . . he entmsts to a specially chosen

commission the responsibility for deciding which new inventions will be brought
before the public and which kept secret:' Pierre-Maxime Schuh!, Machinisme et
philosophie (Paris, 1938), pp. 7, 35.-"The bombers remind us of what Leonardo

The pathological element in the notion of "culture" comes vividly to light in the
effect produced on Raphael, the hero of The Wild Ass's Skin, by the enormous
stock of merchandise in the four-story antique shop into which he ventures. "To

Some theses by Focillon which have appearances on their side, Of course, the
materialist theory of art is interested in dispelling such appearance, "We have no
right to confuse the state of the life of forms with the state of social life, The time
that gives support to a work of art does not give definition either to its principle
or to its specific form" (p, 93). "The combined activity of the Capetian monar­
chy, the episcopacy, and the townspeople in the development of Gothic cathe­
drals shows what a decisive influence may be exercised by the alliance of social
forces, Yet no matter how powerful this activity may be, it is still by no means
qualified to solve problems in pure statics, to combine relationships of values.

Focillon on technique: "It has been like some observatory whence both sight and
study might embrace within one and the same perspective the greatest possible
number of objects and their greatest possible diversity. For technique may be
interpreted in many various ways: as a vital force, as a theory of mechanics, or as
a mere convenience. In my own case as a historian, I never regarded technique as
the automatism of a 'craft; nor as . . . the recipes of a 'cuisine'; instead I saw it as
a whole poetry of action and . . . as the means for attaining metamorphoses. It
has always seemed to me that . . . the observation of technical phenomena not
only guarantees a certain controllable objectivity, but affords entrance into the
very heart of the problem, by presenting it to us in the same terms andfiom the same
point of view as it is presented to the artist. " The phrase italicized by the author

method of classification. I have elsewhere pointed out the dangers of 'evolution':

Hasn't his eternal vagabondage everywhere accustomed him to reinterpreting
the image of the city? And doesn't he transform the arcade into a casino, into a
gambling den, where now and again he stakes the red, blue, yellow jetonJ of
feeling on women, on a face that suddenly surfaces (will it return his look?), on a
mute mouth (will it speak?) ? What, on the baize cloth, looks out at the gambler
from every number-luck, that is-here, from the bodies of all the women,
winks at him as the chimera of sexuality: as his type. This is nothing other than
the number, the cipher, in which just at that moment luck will be called by name,
in order to jLilllP immediately to another number. His type-that's the number
that pays off thirty-six-fold, the one on whim, without even trying, the eye of the
voluptuary falls, as the ivory ball falls into the red or black compartment. He
leaves the Palais-Royal with bulging pockets, calls to a whore, and once more
celebrates in her arms the communion vvith number, in which money and riches,
absolved from every earthen weight, have come to him from the fates like a
joyons embrace returned to the full. For in gambling hall and bordello, it is the
same supremely sinful delight: to challenge fate in pleasure. Let unsuspecting
idealists imagine that sensual pleasure, of whatever stripe, could ever determine
the theological concept of sin. The origin of tme lechery is nothing else but this
stealing of pleasure from out of the course of life with God, whose covenant with
sucll life resides in the name. The name itself is the cry of naked lust. This sober
thing, fateless in itself-the name-knows no other adversary than the fate that
takes its place in whoring and that forges its arsenal in superstition. Thus in
gambler and prostitute that superstition whim arranges the figures of fate and
fills all wanton behavior with fateful forwardness, fateful concupiscence, bringing
even pleasure to kneel before its throne.                                          [01 , 1 ]

100,000 francs so he could continue playing; after this seandal broke, he had to
leave Paris. ��Bliicher never quit Salon 113 at the Palais-Royal, and spent six
million during his stay; all his lands were in pledge at the time of his departure

It is only by comparison with the ancien regime that one can say that in the
nineteenth century the bourgeois takes to gambling.                                [01 ,4]

The following account shows very conclusively how public immorality (in con­
trast to private) carries in itself, in its liberating cynicism, its own corrective. It is
reported by Carl Benedict Hase, who was in France as an indigent tutor and who
sent letters home from Paris and other stations of his wandering. "As I was
walking in the vicinity of the Pont Neuf, a heavily made-up prostitute accosted
me. She had on a light muslin dress that was tucked up to the knee and that
clearly displayed the red silk drawers covering thigh and belly. ' Tiens, liens, mon
ami)' she said, �you are young, you're a foreigner, you will have need of it." She
then seized my hand, slipped a piece of paper into it, and disappeared in the
crowd. Thinking I had been given an address, I looked at the missive; and what
did I read?-An advertisement for a doctor who was claiming to cure all imagin­
able aihnents in the shortest possible time. It is strange that the girls who are
responsible for the malady should here put in hand the means to recover from
it." Carl Benedict Hase, Briefi von der Wanderung und aus Paris (Leipzig, 1894),
pp. 48-49.                                                                         [01,5]

On what is "close" (Veuillot: "Paris is musty and close") in fashion: the "glaucous
gleam" under the petticoats, of which Aragon speaks.' The corset as the torso's
arcade. The absolute antithesis to this open-air world of today. What today is de
rigueur among the lowest class of prostitutes-not to undress-may once have
been the height of refinement. One liked the woman retrousJee, tucked up. Hessel
thinks he has found here the origin of Wedekind's erotics; in his view,
Wedekind's fresh-air pathos was only a bluff. And in other respects? 0 Fashion 0

On the dialectical function of money in prostitution. It buys pleasure and, at the
san1e time, becomes the expression of shame. "I knew;' says Casanova of a
procuress, "that I would not have the strength to go without giving her some­
thing;' ills striking admission reveals his knowledge of the most secret mecha­
nism of prostitution. No girl would choose to become a prostitute if she counted
solely on the stipnlated payoff from her partner. Even his gratitude, which per­
haps results in a small percentage more, would hardly seem to her a sufficient
basis. How then, in her unconscious understanding of men, does she calculate?
This we cannot comprehend, so long as money is thought of here as only a
means of payment or a gift. Certainly the whore's love is for sale. But not her
client's shame. The latter seeks some hiding place during this quarter-hour, and
finds the most genial: in money. There are as many nuances of payment as there
are nuances of lovemaking-lazy and swift, furtive or brutal. What does this
signify? The shame-reddened wound on the body of society secretes money and
closes up. It fonns a metallic scab. We leave to the roue the cheap pleasure of
believing himself devoid of shame. Casanova knew better: impudence throws
the first coin onto the table, and shame pays out a hundred more to cover it.

��The dance in which . . . vulgarity makes its appearance with unexampled impu­
dence is the traditional French quadrille. When the dancers manage to offend
against every tender feeling by their pantomime-without � however, going so far
as to have to fear heing ejected from the room by the on-duty police agents-then
this type of dance is called quincan. But when all moral sent.iment is trampled on
by the manner of the dancing, when at last, after lengthy hesitation, the sergeants
de ville feel compelled to recall the dancers to a sense of decorum with the custom­
ary words, "'Dance more decently or you will he shown t.hc door!"-then this
intensification or, heUer, �this degradat.ion' is known as chahue. /   '   "The bestial
grossness . . . has led to the creation of a police ordinance . . . . Men, accordingly,
are not allowed to appear at these halls either masked or in costume. This is in part
to prevent their being tempted by their disguise to hehave still more vilely hut also �
and chiefly, in the event a dancer should reach the Parisian ne plus ultra of de­
pravity in dancing and subsequently he shown to the door by the sergeants de
ville, to make sure he will be recognized thereafter and kept from reentering the
room . . . . Women, on the other hand, are not allowed to appear unless they are
masked." Ferdinand von Gall, Paris und seine Salons (Oldenburg, 1844,), vol. 1 ,
pp. 209, 213-214.                                                        [01 a,S]

Comparison of today's erotic fields of action with those of the middle of the
previous century. The social play of eroticism turns today on the question: How
far can a respectable woman go without losing herself? To represent the joys of
adultery without its actual circumstances is a favorite device of dramatists. The
terrain on which love's duel with society unfolds is thus, in a very broad sense,
the realm of "free" love. For the Forties, Fifties, and Sixties of the previous
century, however, things were entirely different. Nothing illustrates this more
clearly than the account of the "pensions" which Ferdinand von Gall provides in
his book Paris und seine Salons (Oldenburg, 1844-1845) <vol. 1 , pp. 225-231>.
cD,ere we learn that in many of these boardinghouses at the evening meal­
which, with prior notification, strangers too could attend-it was the fille to
bring in cocottes, whose job it was to play the part of girls from good families. In
fact, they were not disposed to let down their masks too quickly, preferring
instead to wrap themselves in endless layers of respectability and fanilly COmlec­
tion; to strip these away entailed an elaborate game of intrigues that ultimately
served to raise the womenls price. What is expressed in these relations, it goes
without saying, is less the period's pruderie than its fanatical love of masquerade.
[02,1]

More on the mania for masks: "We know from the statistics on prostitution that
the fallen woman takes a certain pride in being deemed by nature still worthy of
motherhood-a feeling that in no way excludes her aversion to the hardship and
disfigurement that goes along with this honor. She thus willingly chooses a middle
way to exhibit her condition: she keeps it 'for two months, for three months ,'
naturally not longer. " F. Th. Vischer, Mode und Cynismus (Stuttgart, 1879), p. 7.
o Fashion 0                                                                  [02,2]

In prostitution, one finds expressed the revolutionary side of technology (the
symbolic side, which creates no less than discovers). "As if the laws of nature to
which love submits were not more tyrannical and more odious than the laws of
society! The metaphysical meaning of sadism is the hope that the revolt of man
will take on such intensily as to summon nature to change its laws. For, with
women no longer wanting to endure the ordeal of pregnancy, the risks and the
sufferings of delivery and of miscarriage, nature will be constrained to invent
some other means for perpetuating humanity on this earth." Emmanuel Berl,
"Premier Panlphlet;' Europe, 75 < 1 929>, pp. 405-406. And in fact: the sexual
revolt against love not only springs from the fanatical, obsessional will to pleas­
ure; it also ainls to make nature adaptable and obedient to this will. The traits in
question here appear more clearly still when prostitution (especially in the cynical
form it took toward the end of the century, in the Paris arcades) is regarded less
as the opposite than as the decline oflove. It is then that the revolutionary aspect
of this decline fuses, as though of its own accord, with the very same aspect in the
decline of the arcades.                                                       [02,3]

Feminine fauna of the arcades: prostitutes, grisettes, old-hag shopkeepers, female

incendiaries disguised as women.                                             [02,4]

five and a half million to the treasury. . . . The gambling houses of the Palais-Royal

cati on the Rue de Richelieu." <Lucien> Dubech and < Pierre> d'Espezel, Histoire

Rites de passage-this is the designation in folklore for the ceremonies that attach
to death and hirth, to marriage, puberty, and so forth. In modem life, these
transitions are becoming ever more unrecognizable and impossible to experience.
We have grown very poor in threshold experiences. Falling asleep is perhaps the
only such experience that remains to us. (But together with this, there is also
waking up.) And, finally, there is the ebb and flow of conversation and the sexual
permutations of love-experience that surges over thresholds like the changing
figures of the dream. "How mankind loves to remain transfixed;' says Aragon,
"at the very doors of the imagination!" Paysan <de Paris (paris, 1926» , p. 74.3 It is
not only from the thresholds of these gates of imagination that lovers and friends
like to draw their energies; it is from thresholds in general. Prostitutes, however,
love the thresholds of d1ese gates of dream.-The threshold must be carefully
distinguished from d1e boundary. A Schwelle <threshold> is a zone. Transforma­
tion, passage, wave action are in the word schwellen, swell, and etymology ought
not to overlook these senses.' On the other hand, it is necessary to keep in mind
the inm1ediate tectonic and ceremonial context which has brought the word to its
current meaning. o Dream House 0                                              [02a,IJ

Under the northeast peristyle of the Palais-Royal lay the Cafe des Aveugles.
��There, a half-dozen hlindmen from the Quinze-Vingts Hospital unceasingly per­
formed more or less deafening music from six 0 ' clock in the evening to one 0 ' clock
in the morning; for the underground establishments were open to the public only
from dusk to dawn. They were the preferred rendezvous of those licensed Dryads

��I submit that the passion for gambling is the noblest of all passions, because it
comprehends all others. A series of lucky rolls gives me more pleasure than a man
who does not gamble can have over a period of several years. I play by intuition,

'



think I recognize gain only in terms of the gold that comes my way? You are
mistaken. I see it in terms of the joys which gold procures, and I savor them to the
full. These joys, vivid and scorching as lightning, are too rapid-fire to hecome
distasteful, and too diverse to beeome boring. I live a hundred lives in one. If it is
a voyage, it is like that of an electric spark . . . . If I keep my fist shut tight, and if I
hold onto my banknotes, it is because I know the value of time too well to spend it

"The adventure of the municipal guardsman on horsehack, placed like a fetish at
the door of a gambler down on Iris luck, has remained in the annals of our circle.
The worthy trooper, helieving himself stationed there to pay honor to the guests at
some reception, was greatly amazed at the silence of the street and the house, when
suddenly, at Hround one o'clock in the morning, the sad victim of the green tahles
returned. As on other evenings, Hnd despite the influence of the fetish, the gambler
had lost heavily. He rings the bell; no one comes. He rings again; nothing stirs in
the lodge of the sleeping Cerherus, and the door is unrelenting. Impatient, irri-
tated, provoked above all by the losses he has just sustained, the tenant smashes a
pane of glass with his walking-stick to rouse the porter. Here the municipal guards­
man, until then a mere spectator of this nocturnal scene, believes it is his duty to
intervene. He stoops down, seizes the troublemaker by the collar, hoists him onto
his horse, and trots smartly off to his barracks, delighted to have a decent pretext
for punishing a faction he dislikes . . . . Explanations notwithstanding, the gambler
spent the night on a camp cot." Edouard Gourdon, Les Faucheurs de nuit (Paris,

I,I,It is useless to expect that a bourgeois could ever succeed in comprehending the
phenomena of the distribution of wealth. For, with the development of mechanical
production, property is depersonalized and arrayed in the impersonal collective
form of the joint stock company, whose shares are finally caught up in the whirl­
pool of the Stock Exchange . . . . They are . . . lost hy one, won by another-in­
deed, in a manner so reminiscent of gamhling that the huying and selling of stocks
is actually known as 'playing' the market. Modern economic development as a
whole tends more aIHI more to transform capitalist society into a giant interna­
tional gambling house, where the hourgeois wins and loses capital in consequence
of events which remain unknown to him . . . . The �inexplicable' is enthroned in
bourgeois society as in a gambling hall . . . . Successes and failures, thus arising
from causes that are unanticipated, generally Ultintelli�rihle, and seemingly de­
pendent on chance, predispose the hourgeois to the gambler's frame of mind . . . .
The capitalist whose fortune is tied up in stocks and bonds, which are suhject to
variations in market value and yield for which he does not understand the causes,
is a professional gamhler. The gmnhler, however, . . . is a snpremely superstitious
being. The hahitues of gamhling casinos always possess magic formulas to (�onjure
the Fates. One will mutter a prayer to Saint Anthony of Padua 01' some other spit'lt
of the heavens; another will place his bet only if a ct�rtain color has won; while a
t.hird holds a rahhit's foot in his left hand; and so on. The inexplicable in society

"Is it an insignifieant delight to tempt fortune? Is it a pleasure devoid of intoxica­
tion to taste in one second months, years, a whole lifetime of fears and hopes? I was
not ten years old when M. Gn§pinet, my master in the junior class, read us the
fable L 'Homme et le genie < The Man and the Genie> . Yet I rememher the talc
hetter than if I had read it yesterday. A genie gives a boy a ball of thread, and tells
him: �This is the thread of your life. Take it. When you find time heavy on your
hands, pull it out; your days will pass quick or slow, according as you unwind the
ball rapidly or little by little. So long as you leave the thread alone, you will remain
stationary at the same hour of your existence.' The hoy took the thread; first he
IHllled at it to become a man, then to marry the girl he loved, then to see his
children grow up, to win offices and profit and honor, to abridge anxieties, to
escape griefs and the infIrmities that come with the years, and finally, alas! to cut
short a peevish old age. He had lived just four months and six days since the date
of the genie's visit. Well, what is gambling, I should like to know, hut the art of
producing in a second the changes that Destiny ordinarily effects only in the
course of many hours or even many years, the art of collecting into a single instant
the emotions dispersed throughout the slow-moving existence of ordinary men, the
secret of living a whole lifetime in a few minutes-in a word, the genie's ball of
thread? Gambling is a hand-to-hand encounter with Fate . . . . The stake is
money-in other words, immediate, infinite possibilities . . . . Perhaps the next
card turned, the hall now rolling, will give the player parks and gardens, fields and
forests, castles and manors lifting heavenward their pointed turrets and fretted
roofs. Yes, that little bouncing ball holds within it acres of good land and roofs of
slate with sculpted chimneys reflected in the hroad bosom of the Loire; it contains
treHsures of art, mHrvels of taste, jewels of price, the most exquisite bOflies in all
the world, nay! even souls-souls no one ever dreamed were venHI, all the decorH­
tions, all the distinctions, all the elegance, and all the puissance of the world . . . .
And you would have me give up gamhling? NHY; if gamhling only availed to give
endless hopes, if our only vision of' it. were the smile of its green eyes? it would he
loved less fanatically. But it has nails of adamant; it is cruel and terrible. At. its
caprice it gives poverty and wretchedness and shame-that is why its votaries
adore it. The fascination of danger is at the bottom of all great passions. There is
no fullness of pleasure unless the precipice is Ileal'. It is the mingling of terror with
delight thHt intoxicates. And what more terrifying than gamhling? It gives and
takes away; its logic is not our logic. It is dumb and hlind and deaf. It is almighty.
It is a God . . . . It has its votHries and its saints, who love it for itself, not for what
it promises, Hnd who fall down in adoration when its hlow strikes them. It strips
them ruthlessly, Hnd t.hey lay the hlame on themselves? not on their duty. "I played

Explanations offered hy Beraud concerning his proposals for new regulations. (1)
With respect to the olel woman at the threshold: "'The second paragraph prohihits
o
o    this woman from passing beyond the doorstep, because it often happens that she
"'
has the audaeity to step out and intercept passersby. With my own eyes I have seen
these panders take men by the arm or by the coat and, so to speak, force them to
enter their houses." (2) With respect to the interdiction on commerce for prosti­
tutes: ��I would also forbid the opening of stores or shops in whichfilles publiques
are installed as milliners, seamstresses, sellers of perfume, and the like. Women
who work in these stores and shops will station themselves at open doors or win­
dows in order to send signals to passersby. . . . There are others more ingenious
who close their doors and windows hut send signals through glass panes unpro­
vided with curtains; or the curtains are left open just enough to permit easy com­
munication between outside and interior. Some of these women rap against the
front of the shop each time a man passes by, so that he returns to the spot where
the noise was heard; and then such scandalous signs and beckonings ensue as
could escape the attention of no one. All these shops are found in the arcades. "

Leipzig, 1839), vol. 2, pp. 149-150, 152-153.                                 [05a,l]

Beraud declares himself in favor of an unlimited number of brothels. "Art. (13)
Every woman or girl of legal age who has suitable space in her living quarters (at
least two rooms), and who is authorized by her husband if she is married, . . . will
be able, as the proprietor or principal tenant of the house she inhabits, to become
mistress of the house and to obtain a license for operating a brothel. " Beraud, Les
Filles publiques de Paris, vol. 2 , p. 156.                                  [05a,2]

Beraud's proposal is that every girl, even a minor, should, if she so desires, be
registered as a prostitute. From his argument: "'Your feeling of duty demands a
continual surveillance to protect these children . . . . To spurn them is to take on
one's head all the consequences of cruel abandonment. . . . They must be regis­
tered, then, and surrounded with all the vigilance of authority. Instead of return­
ing them to an atmosphere of corruption, let us submit these hardly nubile girls to
a regular life in a house specially designed to receive them . . . . Notify their par­
ents. As soon as they understand that the dissolute life of their daughters will
remain undisclosed, that it is a secret religiously guarded by the administration,
they will consent once ag�dn to acknowledge them." Beraud, Les Filles publiques,
<vol. 2 , > Pl'. 170-171.                                                     [05a,3]

" Why don't . . . the police allow . . some of the mistresses of the better-known
houses of prostitution to give . . . evening parties, balls, and concerts, with the
addition of tables for ecarte? Then, at least, the sharpers could be carefully
watched, whereas in other circles [gambling houses are meant] this is impossible,
seeing that police action . . . there is . . . virtually nil." F. F. A. Beraud, Les Filles
publiques de Paris e' la police qui les regi' (Paris and Leipzig, 1839), vol. 2, p . 202.

"There are . . . epochs, seasons of the year even, which are fatal to the virtue of a
great many young Parisiennes . During these periods, in the licensed brothels and
elsewhere, the investigations of the police turn up many more girls engaged in illicit
prostitution than during all the rest of the year. I have often inquired into the
causes of these periodic surges of dehauchery, hut there isn't anyone-even in the
administration-who (�an answer this question. I have to rely on my own ohserva­
tions here, and, after much perseverance, I have finally succeeded in discovering
the true principle of this increase in prostitution . . . at . . . certain times of the
year. . . . With the approach of New Year's Day, of the Feast of Kings, and the
festivals of the Virgin, . . . girls like to give and receive presents or to offer beauti­
ful bouquets; they also want a new dress for themselves, or a hat in the newest
fashion, and, lacking the necessary pecuniary means, . . . they turn for some days
to prostitution to acquire such means . . . . Here, then, are the motives for the
recrudescence in acts of debauchery at certain intervals and during certain holi­
days." F. F. A. Beraud, Les Filles publiques de Paris et la police qui les regit (Paris
and Leipzig, 1839), vol. 1, pp. 252-254.                                            [06,2]

Against the medical examination at police headquarters: "Every woman seen
walking along the Rue de Jerusalem, either to or from the police station there, is
immediately stigmatized with the name fille publique . . . . It is a regular scandal.
On the days set aside for visits, one always fmds the approaches to the station
overrun by a large numher of men awaiting the appearance of these unhappy
creatures, knowing, as t.hey do, that thosc who leave hy the dispensary have been
deemed healthy." F. F. A. Beraud, Les Filles publiques de Pm-is, vol. 1, pp. 189-

The lorettes preferred the neighborhood around Notre Dame de Lorette because it
was new, and hecause, as the first occupants of the recently constructed huildings ,

"If it is a different sort of allure that. you seek, go to the Tuileries, to the Palais­
Royal, or to the Boulevard des Italiens. There you will see more than one urhan
siren seated on a chair, her feet resting on another chair, while beside her a third
chair lies vacant. It is a magnet for the ladies' man . . . . The milliners' shops . . .
likewise offer a multitude of resources for enthusiasts. There you dicker over
hats-pink, green, yellow, lilac, or plaid. You agree on a price; you give your
address; and next day, at the appointed hour, you see arrive at your place not only
the hat but the girl who was positioned hehind it, and who was crimping, with
delicate fingers, the gauze, the ril)hon, or some other frill so pleasing to the la­

""That the numher ofjilles publiques at first seems very great is mving to a sort of
phantasmagoria produced by the comings and goings of these women along a rou­
tine cit·cuit l which has the effect of multiplying them to infinity. . . . Adding to this
illusion is the fact that, on a single evening, the jille publique very often sports
multiple disguises. \Vit.h an eye just the least hit practiced, it is easy t.o convince
8    oneself that the woman who at eight 0� clock is dressed in a rich and elegant outfit is
'"
the same who appears as a cheap grisette at nine, and who will show herself at ten
in a peasant dress. It is this way at all points in the capital to which prostitutes are
habitually drawn. For example: follow one of these girls down the boulevard,
between the Porte Saint-Martin and the Porte Saint-Denis. She is attired for the
nonce in a hat with feathers and a silk gown covered by a shawl. She turns into the
Rue Saint-Martin, keeping always to the right-hand side, comes to the narrow
streets that border the Rue Saint-Denis, and enters one of the numerous houses of
debauchery located there. A short time later, she comes out wearing her gray gown
or rustic weeds." F. F. A. Beraud � Les Filles publiques de Paris (Paris and Leipzig,

might happen to he, there is 110 luck, in the playing of the Stock Exchange, that
could withstand the exorbitant commissions of the stockbrokers . . . . On the
Rhine, there are two gambling establishments (at Homburg and Wiesbaden) where
they conduct a game of trente et quurunt'e in which a slight commission of 62 1/2
centimes for every 100 francs is deducted in advance . . . . This is . . . one thirty­
second of the stockbroker's commission and the earnings combined. Trente et
quurunte is played for red and black, just as on the Stock Market one plays for the
rise and fall, with the difference that the odds are always exactly the same with the
former and any kind of fraud is impossible-the weak, there, being not at all at the
mercy of thc strong" <po 16>.                                                 [07a,7]

In the provinces, speculation on the Stock Exchange was dependent on " getting
news from Paris . . . about the fluctuations in the exchange of the most important
stocks . . . . Special couriers and carrier pigeons had to serve this end, and one of
the favorite methods in a France that, in those days, was dotted with windmills was
to transmit signals from mill to mill. If the window of one of these mills was opened,
that meant a rise in prices, and the signal was taken up by nearby mills and passed
on; if the window remained closed, then a fall in prices was indicated. And the
news traveled in this way, from mill to mill , out of the capital and into the prov­
inces." The Blanc brothers, however, preferred to make use of the optical tele­
graph, which was legally reserved for the government. " One fine day in 1834, at
the request of an agent for Blanc, a Parisian telegraphist in an official telegram
sent an H to Bordeaux, which was supposed to indicate a rise in stocks. In order to
mark this letter, and also to guard against discovery, he inserted after the H a
symbol denoting error." Difficulties cropped up along this route, and so the Blancs
combined this method with another. ·"If, for example, the French stocks at 3
percent showed an advance of at least 25 centimes, then the Paris agent for the
Blancs, a certain Gosmand, sent a packet containing gloves to the telegraph official
in Tout's, whose name was Guibout, and who was prudently addressed on the
parcel as a manufacturer of gloves and stockings. But if there was a decline of at
least the same amount, then Gosmand sent stockings or neckties. The address
written on this packet carried a letter or a numher which Guihout then immedi­
ately dispatched, together with the error symbol, in an official telegram to Bor­
deaux." This syst.em functioned for about two years. Reported in the Gazette des
Tribunaux of 1837. Egon Caesar Conte Corti, Der ZalLberer 'von Hornburg lLnd

" It is hy the tendency of the mind caned reminiscence that the wishes of the man
condemned to the glittering captivity of cities incline . . . toward a stay in the
country, toward his original abode, or at least toward the possession of a simple,
tranquil garden. His eyes aspire to rest on some greenery, sufficiently far away
from the stresses of the shop counter or the intrusive rays of the living room lamp.
His sense of smell, continually assaulted by pestilent emanations, longs for the
scent of flowers. A border of modest and mild violets would altogether ravish his
senses . . . . This happiness . . . denied him, he would push the illusion so far as to
transform the ledge of his window into a hanging garden, and the mantelpiece of
his unassuming parlor into an enamel bed of blossoms and leaves. Such is the man
of the city, and such is the source of his passion for the flowers of the fields . . . .
These reflections induced me to set up a number of looms on which I had weavers
make designs imitating the flowers of nature . . . . The demand for these kinds of
shawls was enormous . . . . They were sold before being made; the orders for their
delivery streamed in . . . . This brilliant period of shawls, this golden age of manu-
facture . . . did not last long, yet in France it resulted in a virtual goldmine, from
which flowed wealth that was all the more considerable in that its main source was
foreign. Along with the fact of this remarkable demand, it may be of interest . . . to
know in what manner it generally propagated itself. Just as I had expected, Paris
bought up very few shawls with natural flowers represented on them. It was the
provinces that demanded these shawls, in proportion to their distance from the
capital; and foreign countries, in proportion to their distance from France. And
their reign is not yet over. I still supply countries all across Europe, where there is
hardly a chance for a shawl of cashmere hearing artificial designs . . . . On the hasis
of what Paris did not do in the case of shawls with natural-flower designs, . . .
couldn't. one conclude, recognizing Paris as the real center of taste, that the far­
ther one gets from this dty, the closer one comes to natural inclinat.ions and feel­

'-'-The gamhler is driven by essent.ially narcissistic and aggressive desires for om­
nipotence. These, insofar as they are not immediately linked to directly erotic
desires, are characterized hy a greater temporal radius of extension. A direct
desire for coitus may, through orgasm, he satisfied more rapidly than the narcis­
sist-aggressive desire for omnipotel1t�e. The fact that genital sexuality, in even the
most favorable cases, leaves a residue of dissatisfaction goes hack, in turn, to three
facts: not all pregenital desires, such as later are subsidiary to genitality, can he
aceommodated in coitus; and from the standpoint of the Oedipus complex, the
object is always a surrogate. Together with these two . . . considerations goes . . .
the fact that the impossihility of acting out large-scale unconscious aggression
contrihutes to the lack of satisfaction. The aggression abreacted in coitus is very
much domesticated . . . . Thus it happens that the narcissistic and aggressive
fiction of omnipotence becomes ahove all a cause of suffering: whoever on that
account has experienced the mechanism of pleasure as abreacted in games of
chance, and possessing, as it were, eternal value, succumhs the more readily to it
in proportion as he is committed t.o the '-neurot.ic pleasure in duration' (Pfeifer);
and, as a consequence of pregenital fixations , he is less able to assimilate such
pleasure to normal sexuality. . . . It should also be borne in mind that, according
to Freud, the sexualit.y of human beings bears the stamp of a function that dwin­
dles, whereas this cannot in any way be predicated of the aggressive and narcissis­
tic tendencies." Edmund Bergler, '-'-Zur Psychologie des Hasardspielers," Imago,

"''The game of chance represents the only occasion on which the pleasure principle,
Hnd the omnipotence of its thoughts and desires, need not be renoun(�ed, and on
which the reality principle offers no advantages over it. In this retention of the
infantile fiction of omnipotence lies posthumous aggression against the . . . author­
ity which has 'inculcated' the realit.y principle in the child. This unconscious
aggression, together with the operHtion of the omnipotence of ideas and the experi­
ence of the socially viable repressed exhibition, conspires to form a triad of pleas­
ures in gambling. This triad stands opposed to a triad of punishments constituted
from out of the unconscious desire of loss, the unconscious homosexual desire for
domination, and the defamation of society. . . . At the deepest level, the game of
chance is love's w.ill to be extorted by an unconscious masochistic design. This is
why the gambler always loses in the long run." Edmund Bergler, '-'ZUl' Psychologic

Brief account of Ernst Simmel's ideas on the psychology of the gamhler: ''-The
insatiable greed that finds no rest within an unending vicious circle, where loss
becomes gain and gain hecomes loss, is said to arise from the narcissistic compul-
sion to fertilize and give birth to oneself in an anal birth fantasy, surpassing and
replacing one's own father and mother in an endlessly escalating process. "Thus,
in the last analysis, the passion for gambling satisfies the claim of the bisexual
ideal, which the narcissist discovers in himself; at stake is the formation of a
compromise between masculine and feminine, active and passive, sadistic and
masochistic; and in the end it is the unresolved decision between genital and anal
libido that confronts the gambler in the well-known symbolic colors of red and
black. The passion for gambling thus serves an autoerotic satisfaction, wherein
betting is foreplay, winning is orgasm, and losing is ejaculation, defecation, and
castration. '" Edmund Bergler. "Zur Psychologie des Hasardspielers," bnago, 22,

Apropos of Freud's conjecture that sexuality is a dwindling function "of" the
human heing, Brecht remarked on how the bourgeoisie in decline differs from
the feudal class at the time of its downfall: it feels itself to be in all things the
quintessence of humankind in general, and hence can equate its own decline with
the death of humanity. (Illis equation, moreover, can play a part in the unmistak­
able crisis of sexuality within the bourgeoisie.) The feudal class, by virtue of
privileges, felt itself to be a class apart, which corresponded to the reality. That
enabled it, in its waning, to manifest some elegance and insouciance.        [01la,3)

A description of the lower class of prostitute that had settled in the vicinity of the
city gate, the barriere. It comes from Du Camp, and would make an excellent
caption for many of Guys's watercolors: "If one pushes open the barrier and tl,e
door tlmt closes the entrance, one finds oneself in a bar furnished with marble or
wooden tables and lighted by gas; tlnough the clouds of smoke given off by the
pipes, one distinguishes garbage men, diggers, carters-drinkers, for the most
part-seated before a flask of absinthe and talking to creat'llreS who are as gro­
tesque as they are pitiable. All of these creatures are dressed, in almost the sanle
way, in that red cotton fabric that is dear to African Negroes, and out of which
the curtains in little provincial inns are made. What covers them cannot be called
a dress; it is a beltless smock, puffed up with a crinoline. Exposing the shoulders
with an outrageously low cut, and comingjust to the level of the knees, this outfit
gives them the look of large, inflated children, prematurely aged and glistening
with fat, wrinkled, dazed, and with those pointed heads that are the sign of
imbecility. When the inspectors, checking the registration book, call them and
they get up to reply, they have all the charm of a circus dog:' Maxime Du Camp,

(,�The basic principle . . . of gambling . . . consists in this: . . . that each round is
independent of the one preceding . . . . Gambling strenuously denies all acquired
conditions, all antecedents . . . pointing to previous actions; and that is what. dis­
tinguishes it from work. Gamhling rejects . . . this weighty past which is the main­
stay of work � and which makes for seriousness of purpose, for attention to the long
term, for right, and for power. . . . The idea of beginning again, . . . and of doing
better, . . . occurs often to one for whom work is a struggle; but the idea is . . .
useless � . . . and one must stumble on with insufficient results. " Alain <Emile-
Auguste Chartier> , Les Idees et les ages < Paris, 1927 > , vol. 1 , pp. 183-184 ("Le
Jeu").                                                                            [012,3]

The lack of consequences that defines the character of tl,e isolated experience
<Erlebnis> found drastic expression in gambling. During the feudal age, the latter
was essentially a privilege of the feudal class, which did not participate directly in
the production process. What is new is that in the nineteenth century the bour­
geois gambles. It was above all the Napoleonic armies that, on their campaigns,
became the agents of gambling for the bourgeoisie.                           [012a,l]

The significance of the temporal element in the intoxication of the gambler has
been noticed before this by Gourdon, as well as by Anatole France. But these two
writers see only the meaning time has for the gambler's pleasure in his wimrings,
which, quickly acquired and quickly surrendered, multiply themselves a hun­
dredfold in his imagination through the numberless possibilities of expenditure
remaining open and, above all, through the one real possibility of wager, of mise
en jell. What meaning the factor of time might have for the process of gambling
itself is at issue in neither Gourdon nor France. And the pastime of gambling is,
in fact, a singular matter. A game passes the time more quickly as chance comes
to light more absolutely in it, as the number of combinations encountered in the
course of play (of coups) is smaller and their sequence shorter. In other words, the
greater the component of chance in a game, the more speedily it elapses. This
state of affairs becomes decisive in the disposition of what comprises the authen­
tic "intoxication" of the gambler. Such intoxication depends on the peculiar
capacity of the game to provoke presence of mind through the fact that, in rapid
succession, it brings to the fore constellations which work-each one wholly
independent of the others-to summon up in every instance a thoroughly new,
original reaction from the gambler. 'This fact is mirrored in the tendency of
gamblers to place their bets, whenever possible, at the very last moment-the
moment, moreover, when only enough room remains for a purely reflexive
move. Such reflexive behavior on the part of the gambler rules out an "interpre­
tation" of chance. The gambler's reaction to chance is more like that of the knee
to the hanuner in the patellar reflex.                                     (012a,2]

The superstitious man will be on the lookout for hints; the gambler will react to
them even before they can be recognized. To have foreseen a winning play
without having made the most of it will cause the uninitiated to think that he is
"in luck" and has only to act more quickly and courageously the next time
around. In reality, this occurrence signals the fact timt the sort of motor reflex
which chance releases in the lucky gambler failed to materialize. It is only when it
does not take place that "what is about to happen;' as such, comes clearly to
conscIOusness.                                                              (013,1]

Only the future that has not entered as such into his consciousness is parried by
the gambler.                                                                (013,2]

The proscription of gambling could have its deepest roots in the fact that a
natural gift of humanity, one which, directed toward the highest objects, elevates
the human being beyond himself, only drags him down when applied to one of
the meanest objects: money. The gift in question is presence of mind. Its highest
manifestation is the reading that in each case is divinatory.               (013,3]

The peculiar feeling of happiness in the one who wins is marked by the fact that
money and riches, otherwise the most massive and burdensome things in the
world, come to him from the fates like a joyous embrace returned to ti,e full.
They can be compared to words oflove from a woman altogether satisfied by her
man. Gamblers are types to whom it is not given to satisfy the woman. Isn't Don

Concerning the heroic element in gambling-as it were, a corollary to Baude­

every year is squandered . . . at the gaming tables of Europe-would one have
enough to make a Roman people out of it, and a Roman history? But that's just
it. Because each man is boru a Roman, bourgeois society aims to de-Romanize
him, and thus there are games of chance and games of etiquette, novels, Italian
operas and stylish gazettes, casinos, tea parties and lotteries, years of apprentice­
ship and travel, military reviews and changing of the guard, ceremonies and
visits, and the fifteen or twenty close-fitting garments which daily, with a salutary
loss of time, a person has to put on and take off again-all these have been
introduced so that the overabundant energy evaporates unnoticed!" Ludwig

��But can you realize what delirium, what frenzy, possesses the mind of a man
impatiently waiting for a gambling den to open? Between the evening gambler and
the morning gambler the same difference exists as between the nonchalant hus­
band and the ecstatic lover waiting under his mistress's window. It is only in.the
morning that quivering passion and stark need manifest themselves in all their
horror. At that time of day, you can stare in wonderment at the true gambler-one
who has not eaten or slept, lived or thought, so cruelly has he been scourged by the
lash of his vice . . . . At that baleful hour, you will meet with eyes whose steady calm
is frightening, with faces that hold you spellbound; you will intercept gazes which
lift the cards and greedily peer beneath them. Gaming-houses then reach sublimity

The ideal of the shock-engendered experience <Erlebnis> is the catastrophe. This
becomes very clear in gambling; by constantly raising the stakes, in hopes of
getting back what is lost, the gambler steers toward absolute ruin.      [014,4]
[The Streets of Paris]

In short, the streets of Paris
Were set to rhyme. Hear how.
-Begi:nning of Dit des rues de Paris, by Guillot (paris, 1875), with
preface, notes, and glossary by Edgar Marcuse (first word of the
second line in the original: "Was")

We leave an imprint each time we enter into a history. t




They spoke of Paris as la ville qui relllue-the city that never stops moving. But
no less important than the life of this city's layout is here the unconquerahle
power in the ll<lIllCS of streets, squares, and theaters, a power which persists in the
face of all topographic displacement. Those little theaters which, in the days of
Louis Philippe, still lined the Boulevard du Temple-how often has one of them
been tom down, only to resurface, newly built, iu some other quartier. (To speak
of " city districts" is odious to me.) How many street names, even today, preserve
the name of a landed proprietor who, centuries earlier, had his denlcsne on their
ground. The name "Chateau d'Eau;' referring to a long-vanished fountain, still
haunts various arrondissements today. Even the better�knowl1 eating estab­
lishments are, iu their way, assured of their small municipal immortality-to say
nothiug of the great literary iunnortality attaching to the Rocher de Cancall, the
Verour, the Trois Freres Proven�aux. For hardly has a name made its way iu the
field of gastronomy, hardly has a Vatel or a Riche achieved its fame, than all of
Paris, including the suburbs, is teemiug with Petits Vatels and Petits Riches. Such
is the moven1ent of the streets, the movement of names, which often enough lun
at cross-purposes to one another.                                                [PI ,I]

And then the timeless little squares that suddenly are there, and to which no
name attaches. They have not been the object of careful planning, like the Place
Vendome or the Place des Greves, and do not enjoy the patronage of world
history, but owe their existence to houses that have slowly, sleepily, belatedly
assembled in response to the sunnnons of the century. In such squares, the trees
hold sway; even the smallest afford thick shade. Later, however, in the gaslight,
their leaves have the appearance of dark-green frosted glass near the street lamps,
and their earliest green glow at dusk is the automatic signal for the start of spring
in the big city.                                                                [PI,2]


The QuarticI' de l'Europe already existed as a project, incorporating the names of
the European capitals, in 1820.                                             [PI,S]

On February 4, 1805, houses were first numbered, by imperial decree. Previous
attempts to do this-in January 1726--had met with violent resistance. Owners of
houses declared themselves ready to number the side entrances, but not their
carriage entrances. The Revolution had already introduced the numbering of
houses according to districts; in some districts, there were 1,500-2,000 numbers.

The function of the saints in the nanling of Parisian streets suddenly became
clear during the Revolution. To be sure, the Rues Saint·Honore, Saint·Roch, and
Saint-Antoine were, for a while, known as Honore, Roeh, and Antoine, but it
could not take hold; a hiatus had opened up that to the ear of the Frenchman was
unendurable.                                                               [PI ,6]

"An enthusiast of the Revolution once proposed transforming Paris into a map of
the world: all streets and squares were to be rechristened and their new names
drawn from noteworthy places and things across the world:' Pursue this in
imagination and, from the surprising impression made by such an optical·
phonetic image of the city, you will recognize the great importance of street
names. Pinkerton, Mercier, and C. F. Cramer, Ansichten der Hauptstadt des.fran·

(" The name La Roquette, given to two prisons, a street, and an entire district,
comes from the plant of that name (Eruca sativa), which used to flourish in for­
merly uninhabited areas." La Grande Roquette was, for a long time, the prison in
which those sentenced to death awaited the outcome of their appeal. Maxime Du
Camp, Paris, vol. 3, p. 264.                                               [PI,9]

The sensuality in street names-certainly the only sort which citizens of the
town, if need be, can still perceive. For what do we know of streetcomers, curb·
stones, the architecture of the pavement-we who have never felt heat, filth, and
the edges of the stones beneath our naked soles, and have never scrutinized dle
uneven placement of the paving stones widl an eye toward bedding down on
them.                                                                     [PI,IO]
�    �'Pont d'Austerlitz! Its famous name evokes for me something quite other than the
"'
battle. Despite what people have maintained to me, and which I accept for form's
sake, it was the hattIe t.hat took its name from the bridge. An explanation for this
took shape in my mind on the basis of my reveries, my recollection of distracted
schooldays, and analogies in the savor and sound of certain words. As a child, I
always kept this explanation under my hat; it was part of my secret language. And
here it is: at the time of wars, crusades, and revolutions, on the eve of hattIe, the
warriors would proceed wit.h their ensigns to this hridge, old as the hills, and
there, in all solemnity, would drink a cup of austerlitz. This austerlitz, formidahle
brew, was quite simply the hydromel of our ancestors, the Gauls, but more bitter
and more filled with seltzer." Charles Vildrac < Charles Messager > , <Les> Ponts de
Paris < Paris, ca. 1930 > .                                                    [Pla,l]

Excursus on the Place du Maroc. Not only city and interior but city and open air
can become entwined, and this intertwining can occur much more concretely.
There is the Place du Maroc in Belleville: that desolate heap of stones with its
rows of tenements became for me, when I happened on it one Suuday afternoou,
not only a Moroccan desert but also, and at the same time, a monument of
colonial imperialism; topographic vision was entwined with allegorical meaning
in this square, yet not for an instant did it lose its place in the heart of Belleville.
But to awaken such a view is something ordinarily reserved for intoxicants. And
in such cases, in fact, street names are like intoxicating substances that make our
perceptions more stratified and richer in spaces. One could call the energy by
which they transport us into such a state their vertu evocatrice, their evocative
power-but that is saying too little; for what is decisive here is not the association
but the interpenetration of images. 'Ibis state of affairs may be adduced, as well,
in connection with certain pathological phenomena: the patient who wanders the
city at night for hours on end and forgets the way home is perhaps in the grip of
this power.                                                                      [Pla,2]

��I read of a geographic scheme in which Paris would be the map, and hackney
coaches the professors. Certainly, I would rather have Paris be a geographic map
than a volume in the Roman calendar; and the names of saints, with which the
streets are baptized, cannot compare, in either euphony or utility, with the names
of the towns that have been proposed as substitutes for them. Thus, the Faubourg
Saint-Denis, according to this plan, would be called the 'Faubourg de Valenci-
ennes; the Faubourg Saint-Marceau would become the Faubourg de Marseille; the
Place de Greves would be known as the Place de Tours or de Bourges; and so on."

A surprising argument, a hundred years ago, in favor of an American system for
demarcating streets : "You poor professors, who teach moral philosophy and
belles lettres! Your names are posted in small black letters on a streetcomer, above
a milestone. The name of this jeweler is as dazzling as a thousand fires-it sbines
like the sun. It is for sale, but it is expensive." Mercier, Le Nouveau Paris) vol. 4,

Apropos of the theory of street names: " Proper names, too, have an effect that is
conceptually unburdened and purely acoustic . . . . To borrow an expression from
Curtius (p. 65), proper names are "bare formulas" which Proust can fill up with
feelings because they have not yet been rationalized by language." Leo Spitzer,
Stilstudien (Munich, 1928), vol. 2 , p . 434.                             [Pla,7)

"Street;' to be understood, must be profiled against the older term "way:' With
respect to their mythological natures, the two words are entirely distinct. The
way brings with it the terrors of wandering, some reverberation of which must
bave struck the leaders of nomadic tribes. In the incalculable turnings and resolu­
tions of the way, there is even today, for the solitary wanderer, a detectable trace
of the power of ancient directives over wandering hordes. But the person who
travels a street, it would seem, has no need of any waywise guiding hand. It is not
in wandering that man takes to the street, but rather in submitting to the monoto­
nous, fascinating, constantly unrolling band of asphalt. The synthesis of these
twin terrors, however-monotonous wandering-is represented in the labyrinth.

How names in the city, though, first become potent when they issue within the
labyrinthine halls of the Metro. Troglodytic kingdoms-thus they hover on the
horizon: Solferino, Italie and Rome, Concorde and Nation. Difficult to believe
that up above they all nm out into one another, that under the open sky it all
draws together. 0 Antiquity 0                                                   [P2,3]

The true expressive character of street names can be recognized as sOOn as they
are set beside reformist proposals for their normalization. For example, Pujoulx's
proposal for naming the streets of Paris after the cities and localities of France,
taking into consideration their geographic positions relative to one another, as
well as their population, and having regard for rivers and mountains, whose
names would go especially to long streets which cross several districts-all of this
"in order to provide an ensemble such that a traveler could acquire geographic
knowledge of France within Paris and, reciprocally, of Paris within France:' J. B .

"Seventeen of the gates correspond to imperial routes . . . . In these names, one
would seek in vain for a general system. What are Antihes, Toulouse, and Bale
doing there beside La Villette and Saint-Ouen? . . . If one had wanted to establish
some distinctions, one could have given to each gate the name of the French city
most distant in that direction." E . de Lahedolliere, Histoire dlL nOllil)CUll (Paris),
p. 5.                                                                            [P2,5]

I.(.Some beneficial measures by the municipal magistracy date from the time of the
Empire. On November 3, 1800, there was, by decree, a general revision of street
names. Most of the grotesque vocables invented by the Revolution disappeared.

The names of politicians were almost all replaced by the names of military men. '

""In 1802, in various neighborhoods-Rue du Mont-Blanc, Chaussee d'Antin­
sidewalks were built, with an elevation of three or four inches. There was then an
effort to get rid of the gutters in the center of the streets." Lucien Dubech and
Pierre d'EspezeJ, Histoire de Pa.ris (Paris, 1926), p. 336.                  [P2,7]

"In 1805, the new system of sequential numbering of houses � begun on the initia­
tive of Frochot and still in effect today: even numbers separated from odd, the
even numbers on the right and the odd on the left, according as one moves away
from the Seine or follows its course. The numbers were white and were placed on a
red background in streets parallel to the river, on a black background in streets
perpendicular to it." Lucien Dubech and Pierre d'Espezel, Histoire de Paris
(Paris, 1926), p. 337.                                                     [P2,8]

Around 1830: "'The Chaussee d'Antin is the neighborhood of the nouveaux riches
of the financial world. All these districts in the western part of town have been
discredited: the city planners of the period believed that Paris was going to develop
in the direction of the saltpeter works, an opinion that ought to instill prudence in
today's developers . . . . A lot on the Chaussee d'Antin had trouble finding a buyer
at 20�OOO to 25,000 francs." Dubech and d'Espezel, Histoire de Paris (Paris,
1926), p. 364.                                                                 [P2a,1]

'"I know nothing more ridiculous and more inconsistent than the names of streets,
squares, blind alleys , and mus-de-sac in Paris. Let us choose at random some of
these names in one of the more beautiful neighborhoods, and we cannot but note
this incoherence and caprice. I arrive by the Rue Croix-des-Petits-Champs; I
cross the Place des Victoires; I turn into the Rue Vuide-Gousset, which takes me to
the Passage des Petits-Peres, from which it is only a short distance to the Palais­
Egalite. What a salmagundi! The first name calls to mind a cult object and a rustic
landscape; the second offers military triumphs; the third, an ambush; the fourth,
the memory of a nickname given to a monastic order; and the last, a word which
ignorance, intrigue, and ambition have taken turns abusing." J. B . Pujoulx, Paris

" Two steps from the Place de ia Bastille in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, people still
say, 'I am going to Paris' . . . . This suburb has its own mores and customs, even its
own language. The municipality has numbered the houses here, as in all other
parts of Paris; but if you ask one of the inhabitants of this suburb for his address,
he will always give you the name his house bears and not the cold, official num­
ber. . . . This house is known by the name 'To the King of Siam,' that by 'Star of
Gold' ; this house is called 'Court of the Two Sisters,' and that one is called 'Name
of Jesus'; others carry the name 'Basket of Flowers,' or "Saint Esprit,' or 'Bel
Air,' or 'Hunting Box,' or 'The Good Seed. '" Sigmund Englander, Geschichte del'

Excerpt from a proposal for naming streets which presumably stems from the
Revolution: "Someone . . . proposed giving streets and alleys the names of virtues
and generous sentiments, without reflecting that this moral nomenclature was too
limited for the great number of streets to be found in Paris . . . . One senses that in
this project there was a certain logic in the arrangement of names; for example, the
Rue de la Justice, or that of l'Ilumanite, had necessarily to lead to the Rue du
Bonheur, . . while the Rue de la Pro bite . . . had to cross all of Paris in leading to
.



the most beautiful neighborhoods." J . B. Pujoulx, Paris a lafin du XVlIle siecle

Concerning the magic of street names. Delvau on the Place Maubert: '"It is not a
square; it is a large blot, so full of filth and mire that even the lips sully themselves
in pronouncing this name from the thirteenth century-not because it is old but
because it exhales an odor of iniquity . . . which shocks the sense of smell."

"It is not superfluous to observe that a foreigner, who, on arriving in a city, starts
out everywhere judging by appearances, could well suppose, in coming upon these
unsystematic and insignificant street names, that the reasoning of those who live
here was no less loosely connected; and ? certainly, if several streets presented him
with base or obscene names ? he would have grounds for believing in the immorality
of the inhabitants." J . B. Pujoulx, Paris it lafin du XVIII" siilcie (Paris, 1801),

"The hawkers choose their newspapers according to which neighborhoods they

What was otherwise reserved for only a very few words, a privileged class of
words, the city has made possible for all words, or at least a great many: to be

Apropos of Victor Hugo's "command of image. The few insights we have into his

Around 1860, the Paris bridges were still insufficient for the traffic between the

" In Hugo, the Vendome Column, the Arc de Triomphe, and the Invalides go hand

three terms, their relation, has changed. The Column has been effectively sup­
planted, in spite of Vuillaume. And it is the Pantheon that has come, as it were, to
replace it-especially since Hugo's success in bringing it to yield, so to speak, to
the great men. Today, the trilogy of monuments is the Arc de Triomphe, the Pan­
theon, and the Church of the Invalides." Charles Peguy, Oeuvr"es completes,

��The true Paris is by nature a dark, miry, malodorous city, confined within its
narrow lanes, . . . swarming with blind alleys, culs-de-sac, and mysterious pas­
sages, with labyrinths that lead you to the devil; a city where the pointed roofs of
the somber houses join together up there ncar the clouds and thus begrudge you
the bit of blue which the northern sky would give in alms to the great capital. . . .
The true Paris is full of freak shows, repositories at three centimes a night for
unheard-of beings and human phantasmagorias . . . . There, in a cloud of ammo­
niac vapor, . . . and on beds that have not been made since the Creation, reposing
side by side are hundreds, thousands, of charlatans, of match sellers, of accordion
players, of hunchbacks, of the blind and the lame; of dwarfs, legless cripples, and
men whose noses were bitten off in quarrels, of rubber-jointed men, clowns mak­
ing a comeback, and sword swallowers; of jugglers who balance a greasy pole on
the tips of' their teeth . . . ; children with four legs, Basque giants and other kinds,
Tom Thumb in his twentieth reincarnation, plant-people whose hand or arm is the
soil of a living tree, which sprouts each year its crown of branches and leaves;
walking skeletons, transparent humans made of light . . . and whose faint voice
can make itself heard to an attentive ear . . . ; orangutans with human intelligence;
monsters who speak French." Paul-Ernest de Rattier, Paris n 'existe pas (Paris,
1857), pp. 12, 17-19. To be compared with this are Hugo's drawings, and also

"Thirty years ago . . . it was still . . . virtually the sewer it had been in ancient
times. A very large numher of streets, whose sm'face is now crowned, were then

or a square terminated, large rectangular gratings with great bars, the iron of
which shone, polished by the feet of the multitude, dangerous and slippery for
wagons, and making horses stumble . . . . In 1832, in many streets, . . . the old

As a legend of the morgue, Maillard cites the following remarks from E. Texier, Le

knows whether the clerk's daughter does not have a piano in her room and, on
Sunday evenings, does not dance with her friends to the strains of the ritornellos of
Pilodo or Musard." According to Maillard, however, the clerk did not live in the
morgue in 1852. Cited in Firmin Maillard, Recherches historiqu.es et critiques su.r
la Morgue (Paris, 1860), pp. 26-27. The account goes hack, as Maillard himself
explains, to a report of 1830 by Leon Gozlan, which for its part was somewhat
feuilletonistic.                                                               [P4a,3]

In Mercier, Nouveau Paris (1800), vol. 6, p. 56, it is recounted that " the mysteri­

the sale of water that they made this noise; their lugubrious hlare, dignified fan­
fare of terror, was most often a threat of arson: 'They were in the taverns, and
they would communicate from one neighborhood to the next,' says Mercier. 'All
their harmonized sounds were centrally coordinated, and when they played with
redoubled force, one expected something to happen. You would listen for a long
while, understanding nothing; but in all this uproar there was a language of sedi­
tion. These plots were no less deep for being hatched so blatantly. It has been
remarked that, at the time of the fires, the signal was more prompt, more rapid,
more shrill. When the hlaze broke out at Les Celestins, . . . my brain had been
dulled the day before by the noise of the horns. On another occasion, the ears were
assailed by the cracking of whips ; on some days, it was a hanging on hoxes. One
trembles at these keen daily alarms. '" Edouard Fournier, Enigmes des rues de

��The importance accorded the traffic of pilgrims-many people in those days went

The oft-formulated observation that the neighborhoods of Paris each have a life
of their own is given support by Stahl (Paris, p. 28) in a reference to certain
Parisian monuments. (He speaks of the Arc de Triomphe, and one could also
mention Notre Dame or Notre Dame de Lorette.) Forming a background to
important streets, these buildings give their districts a center of gravity and, at the
same time, represent the city as such within them. Stahl says "that each monu­
mental edifice . . . appears with an escort, like a prince with his train of followers,
and by this retinue it is separated from the respectfully withdrawing masses. It
becomes the ruling nucleus of a neighborhood that appears to have gathered
around it" (p. 25).                                                               [P5,4]

The postrevolutionary Versailles as waxworks: "The leftover royal statues were
remodeled. That of Louis XIV in the great Salle de l'Orangerie wears a liberty cap

and� so that no one mistakes the identity of the newly created god of war, t.here is
written at the foot of the statue: 'French Mars, protector of the liberty of the
world.' A similar prank was played with Coustou's colossal has-relief, repre­
senting Louis XIV on horseback, in the large gallery of the chateau. The genius of
fame, who descends from the clouds, holds a liberty cap over the hare head of the
king, instead of the laurel wreath of former times." 0 Colportage 0 F. J. L. Meyer,

On the exhibition of a group of thieves reproduced in wax, which (around 1785)
was put together hy Curtins or some other entrepreneur for the fair in Saint­
Laurent: "Some were chained and clad in rags, while others were almost naked
and lying on straw. It was a fairly graphic rendering. The only portraits that were
likenesses were those of the two or three leaders; but since the gang was large, the
owner had heen obliged to find them some company. I took it foJ.' granted that he
had fashioned these others more or less according to whim, and with this thought
in mind I was rather casually strolling past the swarthy faces-often obscured by
the coarse moustaches of these inferior brigands-when I thought I perceived
beneath their repulsive appearance some characteristics that were not at all unfa­
miliar. As I looked more closely, I became convinced that the owner of the master
thieves (who was also the owner of the other waxworks), wanting to make use of
some wax figures that were no longer in fashion, or of some commissioned portraits
that were subsequently rejected, had dressed them up in rags, loaded them with
chains, and slightly disfigured them in order to place them here with the great
thieves . . . . I could not help smiling when I considered that the wife of one of the
subjects might well discover, among these gentlemen, the portrait of her husband
that had once been so gloriously commissioned. And, really, I am not joking when
I say that I saw among this group an excellent likeness of Linguet, * who, several
months earlier, had enjoyed a place of honor in the other room, and who undoubt­
edly had been transported here for economic reasons, and to fill out the prison."

I t remains to b e discovered what is meant when, in the dioramas, the variations
in lighting which the passing day brings to a landscape take place in fifteen or
thirty minutes. Here is something like a sportive precursor of fast-motion cinema­
tography-a witty, and somewhat malicious, "dancing" acceleration of time,
which, by way of contrast, makes one think. of the hopelessness of a mimesis, as
Breton evokes it in Nadja: the painter who in late aftemoon sets up his easel
before the Vieux-Port in Marseilles and, in the waning light of day, constantly
alters the light-relations in his picture, until it shows only darkness. For Breton,
however, it was "unfinished!':'                                                  [QJ. aA]


To reflect rigorously on the particular pathos that lies hidden in the art of the
panoramas. On the particular relation of this art to nature, but also, and above
all, to history. How peculiar this relation was may be gathered from these sen­
tences by Wiertz, whose painting, in fact, has a distinctly panoramic tendency.
"There has been much talk of realism in painting. Generally speaking, paintings
which are called 'realistic' are rarely in keeping with this rubric. Pure realism
ought to manage things so that a represented object would seem within reach of
your hand. . . . If, in general, what is properly termed trompe-l'oeil has been little
appreciated, that is because up until now this geme of painting has been practiced
only by mediocre painters, by sign painters, those restricted merely to the repre-
sentation of certain still-life objects . . . . WIll the example of M. Wiertz give birth
to a new genre?" Commentary on La Curieuse, in the catalogne written by the
painter himself and entitled L'Atelier de M.     Wiertz. In Oeuvres litteraires <Paris,

The fact that film today articulates all problems of modern form-giving-lmder­
stood as questions of its own technical existence-and does so in the most
stringent, most concrete, most critical fashion, is important for the following
comparison of panoramas with this medium. "The vogue for panoramas, m110ng
which the panorama of Boulogne was especially remarkable, corresponds to the
vogne for cinematographs today. The covered arcades, of the type of the Passage
des Panoramas, were also beginning their Parisian fortnnes then:' Marcel Poete,

"Many people imagine that art can be perfected indefinitely. Tbis is an error.
There is a limit at which it stops. And here is why: it is because the conditions in
which the imitation of nature is confined are innnutable. One wants a pictnre­
that is to say, a flat surface, surrounded or not surrounded by a frame-and on
this surface a representation prodnced exclusively by means of various colored
snbstances . . . . WIthin these conditions, which constitute tlle picture, everything
has been attempted. The most diffienlt problem was perfect relief, deep perspec­
tives carried to the most complete illnsion. The stereoscope resolved it:' A. J.
Wiertz, Oeuvres litteraires (Paris, 1870), p. 364. This comment not only throws an
interesting light on the points of view from which people looked at things like
stereoramas in those days; it also shows very clearly that the theory of "progress"
in the arts is bound up with the idea of the imitation of natnre, and must be
disenssed in the context of this idea.                                           [Q7 ,1]
The multiple deployment of figures in the wax museum opens a way to the
colportage phenomenon of space and hence to the fimdamental ambiguity of the
arcades. The wax statues and busts-of which one is today an emperor, tomor­
row a political subversive, and the next day a liveried attendant; of which another
represents todayJulia Montague, tomOlTOW Marie Lafargue, the day after tomor­
row Madame Doumergue-all are in their proper place in these optical whisper­
ing-galleries. For Louis XI, it is the Louvre; for Richard II, the Tower; for Abdel
Krim, the desert; and for Nero, Rome. 0 F1&neur 0                             [Q7 ,2]

Dioramas take the place of the magic lantern, which knew nothing of perspec­
tive, but with which, of course, the magic of the light insinuated itself quite
differently into residences that were still poorly lit. "Lanteme magique! Piece
curieuse!" With this cry, a peddler would travel through the streets in the evening
and, at a wave of the hand, step up into dwellings where he operated his lantern.

The interest of the panorama is in seeing the true city-the city indoors. What
stands within the windowless house is the true. Moreover, the arcade, too, is a
windowless house. The windows that look down on it are like loges from which

The innermost glowing cells of the city of light, the old dioramas, nested in the
arcades, one of which today still bears the name Passage des Panoramas. It was,
in the first moment, as though you had entered an aquarium. Along the wall of
the great darkened hall, broken at intervals by narrow joints, it stretched like a
ribbon of illuminated water behind glass. The play of colors among deep-sea
fauna cannot be more fiery. But what came to light here were open-air, atmo­
spheric wonders. Seraglios were mirrored on moonlit waters; bright nights in
deserted parks loomed large. In the moonlight you could recognize the chateau
of Saint-Leu, where the last Conde was found hanged in a window. A light was
still burning in a window of the chateau. A couple of times the sun splashed wide
in between. In the clear light of a summer morning, one saw the rooms of the
Vatican as they might have appeared to the Nazarenes; not far beyond rose
Baden-Baden. But candlelight, too, was honored: wax tapers encircled the mur­
dered Duc de Berry in the dusky cathedral that served as mortuary chapel, and
hanging lamps in the silken skies of an isle of love practically put round Luna to
shame. It was an ingenious experiment on the moonstruck magic night of Ro­
manticism, and its noble substance emerged from the trial victorious.       [Q;l,2]

The way mirrors bring the open expanse, the streets, into the cafe-this, too,
belongs to the interweaving of spaces, to the spectacle by which the flaneur is
ineluctably drawn. "During the day, often sober; in the evening, more buoyant,
when the gas flames glow. The art of the dazzling illusion is here developed to
perfection. The most commonplace tavern is dedicated to deceiving the eye.
Through mirrors extending along walls, and reflecting rows of merchandise right
and left, these establishments all obtain an artificial expansion, a fantastical mag­
nitude, by lamplight;' Karl Gutzkow, Briqe aus Paris (Leipzig, 1842), vol. 1 ,
p. 225.
Thus, precisely with the approach of night, distant horizons bright as day open
up throughout the city.                                                         [RI ,IJ

Here, in connection with the mirror motif, should be mentioned the story of the
man who could not bear to have, in the interior of his shop or bistro, the legend
on the outer windowpane incessantly before his eyes in mirror writing. To dis­
cover an anecdote that accords with this.                                       [RI,2J

Brittle, too, are the mosaic thresholds that lead you, in the style of the old
restaurants of the Palais·Royal, to a "Parisian dumer" for five francs; they mount
boldly to a glass door, but you can hardly believe that behind this door is really a
restaurant. The glass door adjacent promises a "Petit Casino" and allows a
glimpse of a ticket booth and the prices of seats; but were you to open it-would
it open into anything? Instead of entering the space of a theater, wouldn't you be
stepping down to the street? Where doors and walls are made of mirrors, there is
no telling outside from in, with all tl,e equivocal illnmination.' Paris is the city of
mirrors. The asphalt of its roadways smooth as glass, and at the entrance to all
bistros glass partitions. A profusion of windowpanes and mirrors in cafes, so as to
make the inside brighter and to give all the tiny nooks and crannies, into which
Parisian taverns separate, a pleasing amplitude. Women here look at themselves
more than elsewhere, and from this comes the distinctive beauty of the
Parisienne. Before any man catches sight of her, she already sees herself ten times
reflected. But the man, too, sees his own physiognomy flash by. He gains his
inlage more quickly here than elsewhere and also sees himself more quickly
merged with tlus, his image. Even the eyes of passersby are veiled nlirrors, and
over that wide bed of the Seine, over Paris, the sky is spread out like the crystal
mirror hanging over the drab beds in brothels.                               [Rl,3]

Where were these mirrors manufactured? And when did the custom of furnishing

Let two milTors reflect each other; then Satan plays his favorite trick and opens
here in his way (as his partner does in lovers' gazes) the perspective on infinity. Be
it now divine, now satanic: Paris has a passion for mirror-like perspectives. The
Arc de Triomphe, the Sacre Coeur, and even the Pantheon appear, from a dis­
tance, like images hovering above the ground and opening, architecturally, a fata
morgana. 0 Perspective 0                                                        [Rl,6]

At the end of the 18608, Alphonse Karl' writes that no one knows how to make
mirrors any more.                                                       [Rl,7]

That the last but also the greatest work of this milTor magic is still around to be
seen is owing, perhaps, more to its high production costs than to its drawing
power and profitability, which today are already on the decline. This work is the
"Cabinet des Mirages" at the Musee Grevin. Here were united, one fioal time,
iron supporting beams and giant glass panes intersecting at countless angles.
Various coverings make it possible to transform these beams into Greek columns
one moment, Egyptian pilasters the next, then into street lamps; and, according
as they come into view, the spectator is surrounded with unending forests of
Greco·Roman temple colunms, with suites, as it were, of innumerable railroad
stations, market halls, or arcades, one succeeding another. A fluctuating light and
gentle music accompany the performance, and conling before each transforma­
tion is the classic sigoal of the hand bell, and the jolt, which we recognize from
our earliest tlips around the world, when, in the Kaiserpanorama, before our
eyes that were full of the pain of departure, an image would slowly disengage
from the stereoscope, allowing the next one to appear.                        [Rl,8]

spell the doom of these human aquariums. Although the life that originally quick­

secret repositories of several modern myths ." Louis Aragon, Le Paysan de Paris

Outside surged "the green, transparent tide, filling the street to a level high above
the houses; and there, up and down, swanl the queerest fish, often nearly human
in appearance. . . . The street itself could have come from some prehistoric hook
of images; gray gahled houses with high pointed roofs and narrow windows, the
latter sometimes straight across, sometimes on a slant, the sides of the houses in
some spots almost overgrown with shells and seaweed, though in other spots
clean and well preserved, and adorned with tasteful paintings and shell
figures . . . . Before every door stood a tall shady coral tree; and planted not
infrequently along the walls, like the grapevines and roses we train on slender
trellises at home, were polyps with spreading arms that reached in their luxuri­
ance high above the windows, often to tile very gables that protruded from tile
roofs:' Friedrich Gerstacker, Die versunkene Stadt « Berlin:> Neufeld and Henius,
1921), p. 30. If a work ofliterature, an imaginative composition, could arise from
repressed economic contents in the consciousness of a collective, as Freud says it
can from sexual contents in an individual consciousness, then in the above de­
scription we would have before our eyes the consummate sublinlation of the
arcades, with their bric-It-brac growing rankly out of their showcases. Even tile
vitreous radiance of the globes of the street lamps, the utter pomp and splendor
of gas lighting, enters into this undersea world of Gerstacker's. The hero sees, to
his amazement, "tlmt, with the gradual infusion of twilight, these undersea corri­
dors just as gradually lit up by themselves. For everywhere in the bushes of coral
and sponge, among the wreaths and thick curtains of seaweed and the tall waving
seagrass towering up behind, were sitting broad-brimmed, glassy-looking medu­
sas, which already at the outset had given off a weak, greenish phosphorescent
light that quickly picked up strength at the approach of darkness and now was
shining with great intensity:' Gerstackel; Die versunkene Stadt, p. 48. Here, the
arcade in Gerstacker in a different constellation: "Hardly had they left the house
than they entered into a wide and airy, crystal-crowned passageway, onto which
nearly all the neighboring houses seemed to issue; just beyond this, however, and
divided from it only by a perfectly transparent partition that appeared to be
fanned of thin sheets of ice, lay the luminous waters." Gerstacker) Die versunkene
Stadt, p. 42.                                                                [R2,2]

As rocks of the Miocene or Eocene in places bear the inlprint of monstrous
creatures from those ages, so today arcades dot the metropolitan landscape like
caves containing the fossil remains of a vanished monster: the consumer of the
pre-inlperial era of capitalism, the last dinosaur of Europe. On the walls of these
caverns their immemorial flora, the commodity, luxuriates and enters, like can­
cerous tissue, into the most irregular combinations. A world of secret affinities
opens up within: palm tree and feather duster, hairdryer and Venus de Milo,
prostheses and letter-writing manuals. The odalisque lies in wait next to the
inkwell, and priestesses raise high the vessels into which we drop cigarette butts
as incense offerings. These items on display are a rebus: how one ought to read
here the birdseed in the fixative-pan, the flower seeds beside tile binoculars, the
broken screw atop the musical score, and the revolver above the goldfish bowl­
is right on the tip of one's tongue. After all, nothing of the lot appears to be new.
The goldfish come perhaps from a pond that dried up long ago, the revolver was
a corpus delicti, and these scores could hardly have preserved their previous
owner from starvation when her last pupils stayed away. And since, to the dream­
ing collective itself, the decline of an economic era seems like the end of the
world, the writer Karl Kraus has looked quite correctly on the arcades, which,
from another angle, must have appealed to hinl as the casting of a dream: "In the
Berlin Arcade, there is no grass growing. It looks like the day after the end of the
world, although people are still moving about. Organic life is withered, and in
this condition is put on display. Castan's Panopticon. Ah, a summery day there,
among the waxworks, at six o'clock. An orchestrion plays mechanical music to
accompany Napoleon Ill's bladder-stone operation. Adults can see the syphilitic
chancre of a Negro. Positively the very last Aztecs. Oleographs. Street youths,
hustlers, with thick hands. Outside is life: a third-rate cabaret. The orchestrion
plays 'You're a Fine Fellow, Emil.' Here God is made by machine." <Karl Kraus,>

On the Crystal Palace of 1851: ��Of course, for sensuous perception, these glass
surfaces are themselves practically dissolved in light. / In its basic principle, this
is by no means something altogether new; rather, its prehistory goes hack centuries
at least, if not millennia. For it begins with the decision to cover the walls with
shining metal plates. I . . . That is the first step on the way to the new valuation of
space at work in the Crystal Palace. In the domed chamber of the Mycenaeans,
this conception of space was already so decidedly in force that the entire space of
the room could be dissolved in luster . . . In this way, however, one sacrificed that
fundamental means of all spatial organization: contrast. The whole of the succeed­
ing historical development was determined through this means-although, from
the perspective of what concerns us at present, this development first begins only a
thousand years later, and then no longer with the 'luster' of metal but with that of
glass. I . The high point here is with the window of the Gothic cathedral. . . .
.   .



The increasing transparency of glass in colorless glazing draws the outer world
into the interior space, while covering the walls with mirrors projects the image of
the interior space into the outer world. In either case the 'wall,' as a container of'
space, is deprived of its significance. The �luster' increasingly forfeits the distinc­
tive color that was part of its character and becomes ever more exclusively just a
mirror of external light. I This process culminated in the profane interior space of'
the seventeenth century, where it was no longer only the embrasures of windows
that were filled with plate glass clear as water, but also the remaining surfaces of
the wall surrounding the room, particularly in places that lay opposite a window
opening: in the 'mirror galleries of the rococo interiors.' I . But in this the
.   .



principle of contrast still prevails . . . . In the Sainte-Chapelle, however, as in
<Versaille's> Hall of Mirrors, this relation between surface and light was consti­
tuted in such a way that it is no longer the light that interrupts the surface area but
the surface area that interrupts the light. I In terms of' the unfolding valuation of
space, therefore, we see a continuous progression. At its end stand the green­
houses, and the halls of the Crystal Palace in London." A. G. Meyer, Eisenbauten
(Esslingen, 1907), pp. 65-66.                                                   [R2a,l]

ambiguous, double-edged. It blinks : it is always this one-and never nothing­
out of which another inunediately arises. The space that transforms itself does so
in the bosom of nothingness. In its tarnished, dirty mirrors, things exchange a
Kaspar-Hauser-Iook with the nothing. It is like an equivocal wink coming from
nirvana. And here, again, we are brushed with icy breath by the dandyish name
of Odilon Redan, who caught, like no one else, this look of things in the mirror
of nothingness, and who understood, like no one else, how to join with things in
their collusion with nonbeing. The whispering of gazes fills the arcades. There is
no thing here that does not, where one least expects it, open a fugitive eye,
blinking it shut again; but if you look more closely, it is gone. To the whisperiog
of these gazes, the space lends its echo. "Now, what," it blinks, "can possibly
have come over me?') We stop short in some surprise. "What, indeed, can pos­
sibly have come over you?" Thus we gently bounce the question back to it.

" Images of interiors are at the center of the early Kierkegaard s philosophical
constructions. These images arc, in fact, produced by philosophy, . . . but they
point beyond this stratum in virtue of the things they hold fast . . . . The great motif
of reflection belongs to the interieur: The 'seducer' begins a note: 'Why can't you
he quiet and well behaved? You have done nothing the entire morning except. to
shake my awning, pull at my window mirror� play with the hell-rope from the third
story, rattle the windowpanes-in short, do everything possible to get my atten­
tion! ' . . . The window mirror is a characteristic furnishing of the spacious nine­
teenth-century apartment. . . . The function of the window mirror is to project the
endless row of apartment buildings into the encapsulated bourgeois living room;
by this means, the living room dominates the reflected row at the same time that it
is delimited hy it." Theodor Wiesengrund-Adorno, Kiel'kegaard (Tiihingen,

·l.lt has often happened to me to note certain trivial events passing before my eyes
as showing a quite original aspect, in which I fondly hoped to discern the spirit of

Tbe change in fashions, the etemally up·to-date <das Ewig-Heutige>, escapes "his­
torical" consideration; it is truly overCOllle only tluough a consideration that is
political (theological). Politics recognizes in every actual constellation the genu-
inely unique-what will never recur. Characteristic of a fashionable considera­
tion, which proceeds from bad contemporariness, is the following item of infor­
mation, which is found in Benda's La Trahison des clercs <The Betrayal of the
Intellectuals>: a German reports his amazement when, sitting at a table d'h8te in
Paris fourteen days after the storming of the Bastille, he heard no one speak of
politics. It is no different when Anatole France has the aged Pilate chatting in
Rome of the days of his governorship and saying, as he touches on the revolt of
the king of the Jews, "Now, what was he called?"3                                [SI ,3J

Definition of the "modem" as the new in the context of what has always already
been there. The always new, always identical "heathscape" in Kafka (Der        FrozejJ)
is not a bad expression of this state of affairs. '''Wouldn't you like to see a picture
or two that you might care to buy?' . . . Titorelli dragged a pile of unframed
canvases from under the bed; they were so thickly covered with dust that when
he blew some of it from the topmost, K. was almost blinded and choked by the
cloud that flew up. ' Wild Nature, a heathscape; said the painter, handing K. the
picture. It showed two stunted trees standing far apart from each other in darkish
grass. In the background was a many-hued sunset. 'Fine; said K., 'I'll buy it.' K's
curtness had been unthinking and so he was glad when the painter, instead of
being offended, lifted another canvas from the floor. 'Here's the companion
picture; he said. It might have been intended as a companion picture, but there
was not the slightest difference that one could see between it and the other; here
were the two trees, here the grass, and there the sunset. But K. did not bother
about that. They're fine prospects; he said. 'I'll buy both of them and hang them
up in my office: 'You seem to like the subject; said the painter, fishing out a third
canvas. 'By a lucky chance I have another of these studies here: But it was not
merely a sinlllar study, it was simply the same wild heathscape again. The painter
was apparently exploiting to the full this opportunity to sell off his old pictures.
'I'll take that one as well,' said K. 'How much for the three pictures?' 'We'll settle
tlmt next time; said tl,e painter. . . . 'I must say I'm very glad you like these
pictures, and I'll throw in all the others under the bed as well. They're
heathscapes every one of them-I've painted dozens of them in my time. Some
people won't have anything to do with these subjects because they're too somber,
but there are always people like yourself who prefer somber pictures.'" Franz

The "modern;' the time of hell. The punishments of hell are always the newest
tlling going in this domain. What is at issue is not that "the same thing happens
over and over," and even less would it be a question here of eternal return. It is
rather tllat precisely in that which is newest the face of the world never alters, that
this newest renmins, in every respect, the same.-Tbis constitutes the eternity of
hell. To determine the totality of traits by which the "modern" is defined would
be to represent hell.                                                            [SI ,5J

Of vital interest to recognize a particular point of development as a crossroads.
The new historical thinking that, in general and in particulars, is characterized by
higher concreteness, redemption of periods of decline, revision of periodization,
presently stands at such a point, and its utilization in a reactionary or a revolu­
tionary sense is now being decided. In this regard, the writings of the Surrealists
and the new book by Heidegger' point to one and the same crisis in its two
possible solutions.                                                            [Sl , 6]

Remy de Gourmont on the " Histoire de la societe fraw;aise pendant la Revolution
ct sous Ie Directoire": " It was the fundamental originality of the Goncourts to
create history with the very detritus of history." Remy de Gourmont � Le IIm� Livre

"If one takes from history only the most general facts, tll0se which lend them­
selves to parallels and to theories, then it suffices, as Schopenlmuer said, to read
only the morning paper and Herodotus. All the rest intervening-the evident
and fatal repetition of the most distant and the most recent facts-becomes
tedious and useless!' Remy de Courmont, Le 11"" Livre des masques (Paris, 1924),
p. 259. The passage is not entirely clear. The wording would lead one to assume
that repetition in the course of history concerns the great facts as much as tlle
small. But the author himself probably has in mind only the former. Against this
it should be shown that, precisely in the minutiae of the "intervening;' the
eternally selfsame is manifest.                                               [Sla,2]

The constmctions of history are comparable to military orders that discipline the
true life and confine it to barracks. On the other hand: the street insurgence of
the anecdote. The anecdote brings things near to us spatially, lets them enter our
life. It represents the strict antithesis to the sort of history which demands "empa­
thy;' which makes everything abstract. The same technique of nearness may be
practiced, calendrically, with respect to epochs. Let us inmgine that a man dies on
the very day he turns fifty, which is the day on which his son is born, to whom
the same thing happens, and so on. If one were to have the main commence at
the time of the birtll of Christ, the result would be that, in the tinle since we
began our chronological reckoning, not forty men have lived. Thus, the unage of
a historical course of time is totally transfonned as soon as one brings to bear on
it a standard adequate and comprehensible to human life. This pathos of near­
ness, the hatred of the abstract configuration of history in its "epochs," was at
work in the great skeptics like Anatole France.                               [Sla,3]

There has never been an epoch that did not feel itself to be "modern" in the sense
of eccentric, and did not believe itself to be standing directly before an abyss. The
desperately clear consciousness of being Ul the middle of a crisis is something
chronic in humanity. Every age unavoidably seems to itself a new age. The
"nl0deln;' however, is as varied in its meaning as the different aspects of one and
the same kaleidoscope. <Compare NlO,l . >                                     [Sla,4]

COll1ection between the colportage intention and the deepest theological inten­
tion. It mirrors it back darkly, displaces into the space of contemplation what
only holds good in the space of thejust life. Namely: that the world is always the
same (that all events could have taken place in the same space) . On a theoretical
plane, despite everything (despite the keen insight lurking within it), this is a tired
and withered truth. Nevertheless, it finds supreme confirmation in the existence
of the pious, to whom all things serve the greatest good, as here the space serves
all that has happened. So deeply is the theological element sunk in the realm of
colportage. One might even say that the deepest truths, far from having risen
above the animal torpor of human being, possess the mighty power of being able
to adapt to the dull and commonplace-indeed, of mirroring themselves, after
their fashion, in irresponsible dreams.                                         [S 1 a,S]


No decline of the arcades, but sudden transformation. At one blow, they became

Every date from the sixteenth century trails purple after it. Those of the nine­
teenth century are only now receiving their physiognomy. Especially from the
data of architecture and socialism.                                       [Sla,7]


Every epoch appears to itself inescapably modem-but each one also has a right
to be taken thus. What is to be understood by " inescapably lTIodern;' however,
emerges very clearly in the following sentence: "Perhaps our descendants will
understand the second main period of history after Christ to have its inception in
the French Revolution and in the tum from the eighteenth to the nineteenth
century, while grasping the first main period in terms of the development of the
whole Christian world, including the Reformation." At another place, it is a
question of "a great period that cuts more deeply than any other into the history
of the world-a period without religious founders, without refoDners or lawgiv­
ers:' Julius Meyer, GeJchichte der modernen FranZOJLsChen Malad (Leipzig, 1867),
pp. 22, 2 1 . The author assumes that history is constantly expanding. But tins is,
in reality, a consequence of the fact that industry gives it its truly epochal charac­
ter. The feeling that an epochal upheaval had begun with the nineteenth century
was no special privilege of Hegel and Marx.                                     [Sla,8]


The dreaming collective knows no history. Events pass before it as always identi­
cal and always new. The sensation of the newest and most modern is, in fact, just
as much a dream formation of events as "the eternal return of the sanle." The
perception of space that corresponds to this perception of time is the interpene­
trating and superposed transparency of the world of the f1iineur. This feeling of
space, this feeling of time, presided at the birth of modem feuilletonism. 0 Dream

"What drives us into contemplation of the past is the similarity between what has
been and our own life, which are somehow one being. Through grasping this
identity, we can transport ourselves into even the purest of all regions-into
death:' Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Buck der Freunde (Leipzig, 1929), p. 1 1 1.'
[S2,2]


Very striking how Hofmarmsthal calls this "somehow one being" a being in the
sphere of death. Hence the inmlOrtality of his "religious novice;' that fictional
character of whom he spoke during his last meeting with me, and who was
supposed to make his way through changing religions down the centuries, as
through the suite of rooms of one grand apartment.' How it is that, within the
narrowly confined space of a single life, this "being somehow one" with what has
been leads into the sphere of death-this dawned on me for the first tinle in Paris,
during a conversation about Proust, in 1930. To be sure, Proust never heightened
but rather analyzed humanity. His moral greatness, though, lies in quite another
direction. With a passion unknown to any Wliter before him, he took as his
subject the fidelity to things that have crossed our path in life. Fidelity to an
afternoon, to a tree, a spot of sun on the carpet; fidelily to garnlents, pieces of
furniture, to perfumes or landscapes. (The discovery he ultinlately makes on the
road to Meseglise is the highest "moral teaching" Proust has to offer: a sort of
spatial transposition of the semper idem.) I grant that Proust, in the deepest sense,
"perhaps ranges himself on the side of death:' His cosmos has its sun, perhaps, in
death, around which orbit the lived moments, the gathered things. "Beyond the
pleasure principle" is probably the best commentary there is on Proust's works.
In order to understand Proust, generally speaking, it is perhaps necessary to
begin with the fact that his subject is the obverse side, Ie revers, "not so mnch of
the world but of life itself."                                                  [S2,3]

has sueeeeded in ereating a dream world as pure, and as disturhing, as these
Jugendstil buildings. Situated, as they are, on the margins of architecture, they

Wiesengrund cites and comments on a passage from Kierkegaard '8 Repetition:
··One climhs the stairs to the first floor in a gas-illuminated building, opens a little
door, and stands in the entry. To the left is a glass door leading to a room. One
continues directly ahead into an anteroom. Beyond are two entirely identical
rooms, identically furnished, as though one were the mirror reflection of the
other." Apropos of tins passage (Kierkegaard, < Gesammelte> Werke, vol. 3 <Jena,
1909> , p. 138), which he cites at greater length, Wiesengrund remarks: �"The du­
plication of the room is unfathomable, seeming to be a reflection without being so.
Like these rooms, perhaps all semblance in history resembles itself, so long as it
itself, obedient to nature, persists as semblance." Wiesengrund-Adorno, Kier­

Mter the Commune: " England welcomed the exiles and did everything it could to
keep them. At the exhibition of 1878, it became clear that she had risen above
France and Paris to take the premier position in the applied arts. If the modern
style returned to France in 1900, this is perhaps a distant consequence of the
barbarous manner in which the Commune was repressed." Dubech and d'Espezel,

" The desire was to create a style out of thin air. Foreign influences favored the
'modern style,' which was almost entirely inspired by floral decor. The English
Pre-Raphaelites and the Munich urbanists provided the model. Iron construction
was succeeded by reinforced concrete. This was the nadir for architecture, one
which coincided with the deepest political depression. It was at this moment that
Paris acquired those buildings and monuments which were so very strange and so
little in accord with the older city: the building in composite style designed by
M. Bouwens at 27 Quai d'Orsay; the subway shelters ; the Samaritaine department
store, erected by Frantz Jourdain in the middle of the historic landscape of the
Quartier Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois." Dubech and d'Espezel, IIistoire de Paris,

"What M. Arsene Alexandre, then, calls 'the profound charm of streamers blow­
ing in the wind'-this serpentine effect is that of the octopus style, of green, poorly
fired ceramics, of lines forced and stretched into tentacular ligaments, of matter
tortured for no good reason . . . . Gourds, pumpkins, hibiscus roots, and volutes
are the inspiration for an illogical furniture upon which appear hydrangeas, bats,
polianthes, and peacock feathers-creations of artists in the grip of an unfortu­
nate passion for symbols and 'poetry. ' . . . In an era of light and electricity, what
triumphs is the aquarium, the greenish, the submarine, the hybrid, the poison­

"It seemed to me worthwhile to bring together, in an issue of the journal [Mino­
taure, 3-4,] containing several admirable specimens of Jugendstil art, a cert.ain
number of mediumistie designs . . . . In fact., one is immediately struck by similari­
t.ies between these two modes of expression. What is J ugendstil, I am tempted to
ask, but an attempt to generalize and to adapt mediumistic design, painting, and
sculpture to dwellings and furniture? We find there the same discordance in the
details; the same impossibility of repetition that guides the true, captivating
stereotypy; the same delight in the never-ending curve (whether it he growing fern,
or ammonite, or embryonic curl); the same profusion of minutiae, the cont.empla­
tion of which seduces the eye away from pleasure in the whole . . . . It could be
maintained that these two enterprises are actually conceived tmder the same sign,
which might well be that of the octopus: ��the octopus," as Lautreamont has said,
�'with the gaze of silk." From one part to another, in terms of plastic design, down
to the very smallest feature, it. is the triumph of the equivocal; in terms of interpre­
tation, down to the most insignificant det.ail, it is the triumph of t.he complex. Even
the borrowing, ad nauseam, of subjects, accessory or otherwise, from the plant
world is common t.o these two modes of expression (which respond, in principle, to
quite different needs for externalization). And both of them display, to an equal
degree, a tendency to evoke superficially . . . certain ancient artforms of Asia and
the Americas." Andre Breton, Point du jour (Paris <1934» , pp. 234...-236.

The view ofJugendstil represented below is very problematic, for no historical
phenomenon can be grasped exclusively under the category of flight; such flight
is always registered concretely in terms of what is flown. "What . . . remains
outside . . . is the din of cities, the unbridled fury not of the elements but of
industry, the all-inclusive sovereignty of the modem economics of exchange, the
world of ongoing activity, of technologized labor, and of the masses, the world
that appeared to the exponents of Jugendstil as a general uproar, stifling and
chaotic:' Dolf Sternberger, 'Jugendstil;' Die neue Runruchau, 45 (September 9,
1934), p. 260.                                                                     [54,IJ

lugendstil and socialist housing policy: "The art of the future will be more per­
sonal than what has come before. At no other time has man's passion for self'­
knowledge been so strong as it is today? and the place where he can best fulfill and
transform his individuality is the house, the house which each of us, according to
his . . . heares desire, will build. . . . In each of us slumbers a gift for ornamental
invention . . . sufficiently compelling . . . to allow us to dispense with any nridclle­
man in order to build our house.'? Mter citing these lines from van de Velde's
Renalssance in modernen Kunstgewerbe < Renaissance in the Modern Decorative
Arts > , Kurski continues: " For anyone who reads this, it must be absolutely clear
that such an ideal is impossible in the present state of society, and that its realiza­
tion is reserved for socialism." J. Karski, ('IoModel'ne Kunststromungen und Sozial­

Among the stylistic elements that enter into Jugendstil from iron construction
and technical desigo, one of the most important is the predominance of the vide
over the jllein, the empty over the full.                                [S4,5]

Just as Ibsen passes judgment 011Jugendstil architecture in The Master Builder, so
he passes judgment on its female type in Hedda Gabler. She is the theatrical sister
of those diseuses and dancers who, in floral depravity or innocence, appear naked
and without objective background onJugendstil posters.                       [S4,6]

When we have to get up early on a day of departure, it can sometimes happen
dmt, unwilling to tear ourselves away from sleep, we dream that we are out of
bed and getting dressed. Such a dream was dreamed inJugendstil by the bour­
geoisie, fifteen years before history woke them with a bang.           [S4a, I]

"The Paris Street;' at the Paris world exhibition of 1900, realizes, in an extreme
manner, the idea of the private dwelling that is characteristic ofJugendstil: "Here,
in a long row, buildings of various kinds . . . have been erected . . . The satirical
newspaper Le Rire has set up a Punch and Judy show. . . . The originator of the
serpentine dance, Loie Fuller, has her theater in the row. Not far away . . . a house
that appears to be standing on its head, with its roof planted in the earth and its
doorsills pointing skyward, and which is known as 'The Tower of Wonders: . . .
Tbe idea, at any rate, is original." Th. Heine, "Die Strasse von Paris;' in Die
PariseI' Weltausstellung in Wort und Bild, ed. Dt: Georg Malkowsky (Berlin, 1900),

On the upside-down manor house: ""This little house, constructed in Gothic style,
stands . . . literally on its head; that is, its roof, with its chimneys and turrets, is
stuck into the ground, while its foundation points to the heavens. Naturally, all the
windows, doors, balconies, galleries, moldings, ornaments , and inscriptions are
upside down too, and even the face of the grandfather clock obeys this ten-
dency . . . . So far, this mad idea is amusing . . . , but once you are inside, it becomes
tiresome. There, you are . . . yourself . . . upside down, together with . . . the
objects on view. . . . One sees a table set for lunch, a rather richly furnished salon,
as well as a hathroom. . . . The adjoining room . . . and some others, too, are
actually lined with concave and convex mirrors. The contractors call them quite
simply "laughing chambers. <OLe Manoir a l' envers," Die PW'iser Weltausstellung

On the London world exhibition of 185 1 : "We still reside amid the aftereffects of
what this exhibition achieved-not only in the realm of technology and machines,
but in the realm of artistic development. . . . We ask ourselves today whether the
movement that led to the production of monumental buildings in glass and iron
. . . WaS not also heralded in the design of furniture and utensils. In 1851 this
question could not have arisen, although there were many things that could be
noted. In the first decades of the nineteenth century, mechanized industry in
England had advanced to the point where furnishings and utensils were being
stripped of superfluous ornamentation so as to be manufactured more easily
through machines. In this way there emerged, for furniture especially, a series of
very simple but thoroughly constructive and altogether sensible forms, in which
we are again beginning to take an interest. The wholly modern furniture of 1900,
which eschews all ornament and puts the accent on pure line, maintains a direct
link to that delicately balanced and compact mahogany furniture of 1830-1850.
But in 1850 no one appreciated what had already in fact been reached in the
pursuit of new and fundamental forms;' (People succumbed, instead, to the
historicism that initially fostered a vogue for the Renaissance.) Julius Lessing,

In connection with Kafka's Titorelli <SI,4>, compare the program of the natural·
ist painters around 1860: "According to them, the position of the artist toward
nature ought to be . . . impersonal-so much so that he should be capable of
painting the same picture ten times in succession, without hesitating and without
having the later copies differ in any way from those that Came before:' Gisela
Freund, La Photographie au point de vue sociologique (manuscript, p. 128).  [55,2]

The fa,ade of the "Information" Building on the Rue Reaumur is an example of
Jugendstil in which the ornamental modification of supporting structures is seen
particularly clearly.                                                      [S5,4]
Influence of the processes of technological reproduction on the realists' theory of
painting: "According to them, the position of the artist toward nature ought to be
completely impersonal-so much so that he should be capable of painting the
same picture ten tinles in succession, without hesitating and without having the
later copies differ in any way from those that came before;' Cisele Freund, La
Photographie en France au XIX' siecie (Paris, 1936), p. 106.                   [S5,5]

Careful attention should be given to the relation of Jugendstil to Symbolism,
which brings out its esoteric side. Therive writes, in his review of Edouard
Dujardin, Mallarmepar un des siens (Paris, 1936) : "In an astute preface to a book
by Edouard Dujardin, Jean Casson explains that Ie symbolisme was a mystical,
magical enterprise, and that it posed the eternal problem ofjargon-'argot essen·
tialized, which signifies, on the part of the artistic caste, the will to absence and
escape; . . . What Symbolism liked best was the semiparodic play with dreams,
with ambiguous forms; and this commentator goes so far as to say that the
melange of aestheticism and bad taste of the sort popularized by Le Chat Noir
(caJ' cone; for cafe concert; leg·o'·mutton sleeves; orchids; and hairstyles inspired
by wrought·iron designs) was a necessary and exquisite combination;' Andre
Therive, "Les Livres" (Le Temps, June 25, 1936).                              [S5a,1]

Demler labored four years on a portrait that hangs in the Louvre, and along the
way he did not scorn the use of a magnifying glass to obtain a reproduction
perfectly faithful to nature. This at a time when photography had already been
invented. <?> So difficult is it for man to relinquish his place and allow the
apparatus to take over for him. (See Cisele Freund, La Photographie en Hance au
XIX' sieele [paris, 1936], p. 112.)                                           [S5a,2]

In a prefiguration ofJugendstil, Baudelaire sketches "a room that is like a dream,
a truly spiritual room. . . . Every piece of furniture is of an elongated form,
languid and prostrate, and seems to be dreaming-endowed, one would say, with
a sonmambular existence, like minerals and plants." In this text, he conjures an
idol that might well call to mind tile "umlatural mothers" of Segantini or Ibsen's
Hedda Cabler: "the Idol . . . Yes, those are her eyes . . . those subtle and terrible
eyes that I recognize by their dread mockery;' Charles Baudelaire, Ie Spleen de

In the book The Nightside of Paris, by Edmund B. d'Auvergne (London, n . d . ,

'''What could be further from us than the amazing amhition of a Leonardo, who,
considering painting as a supreme end, a supreme display of knowledge, and
deciding that it called for omniscience, did not hesitate to embark on a universal
analysis whose depth and predsion leave us overwhelmed? The passage from the
ancient grandeur of painting to its present condition is quite perceptible in the
artworks and writings of Eugene Delacroix. This modern, full of ideas� is tortured
with restlessness and a sense of impotence; at each instant he encounters the limits
of his resources in his efforts to equal the masters of the past. Nothing could better
illustrate the diminution of that indefinable force and fullness of earlier days than
the spectacle of that very noble artist,divided against himself, embarking nerv­
ously on a last struggle to attain the grand style in art." Paul Valery,Pieces sur

Dolf Sternberger's essay I.�Hohe See und Schiffbruch" < High Seas and Shipwreck>
is concerned with the >"transformations of an allegory." "It is from allegory that
genre is born. Shipwreck as allegory signifies . . . the ephemerality of the world in
general; shipwreck as genre is a peephole looking out on a world beyond ours,on a
dangerous life that is not our life but is nevertheless necessary. . . . This heroic
genre remains the sign under which the reorganization and reconciliation of soci­
ety . . . begins," as he writes in another passage with reference to Spielhagen's

"Private comfort was virtually unknown among the Greeks. These citizens of

""Far from saying that the progress of art is parallel to that made by a nation in the

un-French), we can unequivocally state,on the contrary, that the epochs and the
countries in which comfort became the public's principal attraction have had the
least talent for art. . . . Convenience excludes style; a pot from an English factory
is better adapted to its end than all the vases of Vulci or Nola. These latter are
works of art� whereas the English pot will never be anything but a household
utensil. . . . The incontestahle conclusion is that nowhere in history is the progress

"The elevation of urban life to the level of myth signifies right away, for the more
dearheaded, a keen predisposition of modernity. The position which this lattcr
concept occupies in Baudelaire is well known . . . . For him, as he says, it is a

Ingres, in his ReportSe au rapport sur I 'Ecole des Beaux-Arts (paris, 1863), makes the
bluntest possible defense of the institutions of the school before the Minister of

against Romanticism. His response has to do, from the beginning (p. 4), with

Segantini's "unnatural mothers;' as a motif of Jugendstil, closely related to Les
Lesbiennes <see J19,4>.The depraved woman stays clear of fertility, as the priest
stays clear of it.Jugendstil, in fact, describes two distinct lines.That of perversion
leads from Baudelaire to W ilde and Beardsley; the hieratic line leads through
Mallarme to George.In the end, a third line stands out more vigorously, the only
one that here and there emerges from the realm of art. This is the line of emanci­
pation, which, taking its departure from Les FleUJ's du mal, conjoins the under­
world that produces the Tagebuch einer Verlorenen'8 with the heights of Zara­
thustra.(This, presumably, the point of the remark made by Capus.)              [S7a,4]

Jugendstil is the stylizing style par excellence.                                 [S8,2]
The idea of eternal return in Zarathustra is, according to its true nature, a styliza­
tion of the worldview that in Blanqui still displays its infernal traits. It is a
stylization of existence down to the tiniest fractions of its temporal process.
Nevertheless: Zarathustra's style disavows itself in the doctrine that IS ex­
pounded through it.                                                             [S8,3]


The tlu'ee defining "motifs" ofJugendstil: the hieratic motif, the motif of perver­
sion, the motif of emancipation. They all have their place in Les Fleurs du mal; to
each of them one can assigu a representative poem from the collection. To the
first, "Benediction"; to the second, "Delphine et Hippolyte"; to the third, "Les
Litanies de Satan."                                                             [S8,4]


Zarathustr'a has, first of all, appropriated to himself the tectonic elements of
Jugendstil, in contrast to its organic motifs. The pauses especially, which are
characteristic of his rhytlunics, are an exact counterpart to the tectonic phenome­
non so basic to this style-namely, the predominance of the hollow form over the
filled form.                                                                    [S8,5]


Certain themes of Jugendstil are derived from technological forms. Thus the
profiles of iron supports that appear as ornamental motifs on fa,ades. See the
essay [by Martin?] in the Franlifitder Zeitung, circa 1926-1929.                [S8,6]


"Benediction": "So thoroughly will I twist this miserable tree I that it will never
put forth its evil-smelling buds!"'" The plant motif of Jugendstil, and its line,
appear here-and certainly not in a passage more ready to hand.                  [S8,7]


Jugendstil forces the auratic. Never has the sun worn a more glorious aureole;
never was the eye of man more radiant than with Fidus. Maeterlinck pushes the
unfolding of the auratic to the point of absurdity. The silence of the characters in
his plays is one of its manifestations. Baudelaire's "Perte d'aureole"20 stands in the
most decided opposition to thisJugendstil motif.                                [S8,8]


Jugendstil is the second attempt on the part of art to come to terms with technol­
ogy. The first attempt was realism. There the problem was more or less present in
the consciousness of the artists, who were uneasy about the new processes of
technological reproduction. (The theory of realism demonstrates this; see S5,5.)
lnJugendstil, the problem as such was already prey to repression. Jugendstil no
longer saw itself threatened by the competing technology. And so the confronta­
tion with teclmology that lies hidden within it was all the more aggressive. Its
recourse to technological motifs arises from the effort to sterilize them ornamen­
tally. (It was tlus, we may say in passing, that gave Adolf Loos's struggle against
ornament its salient political significance.)                                  [S8a,1]
The fundamental motif ofJugendstil is the transfiguration of infertility.The body
is portrayed, preferably, in the forms that precede sexual maturity.         (S8a,2]

Lesbian love carries spiritualization forward into the very womb of the woman.
There it raises its lily-banner of "pure love;' which knows no preguancy and no
fantily.                                                                     (S8a,3]

The consciousness of someone prone to spleen furnishes a miniature model of
the world spirit to which the idea of eternal recurrence would have to be as­
crihed.                                                                      (S8a,4J

"There, man passes through forests of symbols / Which observe him with fanril­
iar eyes." "Correspondances." It is the flower-gazes of Jugendstil that emerge
here.Jugendstil wins back symhols. The word "symbol" is not often found in
Baudelaire.                                                                  (S8a,5]

The development that led Maeterlinck, in the course of a long life, to an ex­
tremey reactionary position is logical.                                     (S8a,6J

The reactionary attempt to sever technologically constituted forms from their
functional contexts and turn them into natural constants-that is, to stylize
them-appears, in a mode sinrilar toJugendstil, somewhat later in Futurism.

The sense of sorrow which autumn awakens in Baudelaire. It is the season of
harvest, the time when the flowers are undone.Autunm is invoked in Baudelaire
with particular solemnity. To it are consecrated the words that are perhaps the
most mournful in all his poetry.Of the sun, it is said: "He bids the crops to grow
and ripen / in the immortal heart that would always flower;'" In the figure of the
heart that would bear no fmit, Baudelaire has already passed judgment on
Jugeudstil, long before its appearance on the scene.                          (S9,lJ

It may be supposed that in the ty pical Jugendstil line-conjoined in fantastic
montage-nerve and electrical wire not infrequently meet (and that the vegetal
nervous system in particular operates, as a funiting form, to mediate between the
world of organism and the world of technology). "The fin-de-siecle cult of the
nerves ...maintains this telegraphic image of exchange.It was said of Strindberg
by his second wife, Frida, ... that his nerves had become so sensitive to atmo­
spheric electricity that an approaching thunderstorm would send its sigual over
them as if over electrical wires!' Dolf Sternberger, Panorama (Hamburg, 1938),

InJugendstil, the bourgeoisie begins to come to terms with the conditions-not
yet, to be sure, of its social dominion-but of its dominion over nature. Insight
into these conditions engenders a strain at the threshold of its consciousness.
Hence the mysticism (Maeterlinck) which seeks to deflect this pressure; but
hence also the reception of technological forms in Jugendstil-for example, of
hollow space.                                                              [S9,4]

The chapter in Zarathustra entitled "Unter T6chtern der Wiiste" <Among the
Daughters of the Desert> is instructive, not only for the fact that the flower
maidens-an important Jugendstil motif-make an appearance here in
Nietzsche, but also in view of Nietzsche's kinship with Guys. The phrase "deep
but without thoughts'"'' perfectly captures the expression worn by the prostitutes
in Guys.                                                                   [S9.,1]

The extreme point in the technological organization of the world is the liquida·
tion of fertility. The frigid woman embodies the ideal of beauty in Jugendstil.
(Jugendstil sees in every woman not Helena but Olympia.)                  [S9.,2]

Individual, group, mass-the group is the principle of genre. For Jugendstil, the
isolation of the individual is typical (see Ibsen).                     [S9a,3]

Jugendstil represents an advance, insofar as the bourgeoisie gains access to the
technological bases of its control over nature; a regression, insofar as it loses the
power of looking the everyday in the face. (That can still be done only within the
security of the saving lie.)25-The bourgeoisie senses that its days are numbered;
all the more it wishes to stay young. Thus, it deludes itself with the prospect of a
longer life or, at the least, a deatll in beauty.                              [S9a,4]

��With the early works of Hennebique and the Perret brothers, a new chapter
opens in the history of architecture. The desire for escape and renewal, it. should
he added, had been seen in the efforts of the Jugendstil school, which failed miser­
ably. These architeets, it seemed, would torture stone to the point of exhaustion,
and they thus prepared the way for a fierce reaction in favor of simplicity. Archi­
tectural art was to he reborn in serene forms through the utilization of new materi­

In his "Salons;' Baudelaire has given himself out as an implacable foe of genre.
Baudelaire stands at the beginning of that "modern style" which represents an
attempt to liquidate genre. In LeJ FleurJ du mal, thisJugendstil emerges for the
first time with its characteristic floral motif.                               [SI0,IJ

The following passage from Valery (OeuvreJ compldeJ, J, cited by Therive, Le
TemPJ, April 20, 1939) reads like a reply to Baudelaire: "Modem man is a slave to
modernity....We will soon have to build heavily insulated cloisters....Speed,
numbers, effects of surprise, contrast, repetition, size, novelty, and credulity will
be despised there:'"                                                           [SI0,2J

Concerning sensation: this pattern-novelty and the depreciation that befalls it,
with a shock-has found a peculiarly drastic expression since the middle of the
nineteenth century. The worn coin loses nothing of its value; the postmarked

inseparable from its character of newness. (The registration of value goes to­

Decisive passage in Proust concerning the aura. He speaks of his journey to
Balbec and comments that it would probably be made today in an automobile,
which, moreover, would have its advantages."But, after all , the special attraction
of the journey lies not in our being able to alight at places on the way ..., but in
its making the difference between departure and arrival not as imperceptible but
as intense as possible, so that we are conscious of it ...intact, as it existed in our
mind when imagination bore us from the place in which we were living right to
the very heart of a place we longed to see, in a single sweep which seemed
miraculous to us not so much because it covered a certain distance as because it
united two distinct individualities of the world, took us from one name to an­
other name; and this difference is accentuated (more than in a form of locomo­
tion in which, since one can stop and alight where one chooses, there can scarcely
be said to be any point of arrival ) by the mysterious operation that is performed
in those peculiar places, railway stations, which do not constitute, so to speak, a
paft of the surrounding town but contain the essence of its personality, just as
upon their signboards they bear its painted name....Unhappily dl0se marvel·
ous places which are railway stations, from which one sets out for a remote
destination, are tragic places also, for ... we must lay aside all hope of going
horne to sleep in our own bed, once we have made up our mind to penetrate into
the pestiferous cavern through which we may have access to the mystery, into
one of those vast, glass-roofed sheds, like that of Saint-Lazare, into which I must
go to find the train for Balbec, and which extended over the rent bowels of the
city one of those bleak and boundless slcies, heavy with an accumulation of
dramatic menaces, like certain slcies painted with an almost Parisian modernity
by Maotegna or Veronese, beneath which could be accomplished only some
solemn and tremendous act, such as a departure by train or the Elevation of the
Cross." Marcel Proust, A l'Ombre desjeunesfilles e"flew, (paris), vol.2, pp.62-

Proust on the museum: �'But in this respect, as in every other, our age is infected
with a mania for showing things only in the environment that properly belongs to
them, thereby suppressing the essential thing: the act of mind which isolated them
from that environment. A picture is nowadays "presented' in the midst of' furni­
ture, ornaments, hangings of' the same period, a secondhand scheme of decora­
tion . . . ; and among these, the masterpiece at which we glance up from the table
while we dine does not. give us that exhilarating delight which we can expect from it
only in a public gallery, which symbolizes far better by its bareness, by the ahsence
of all irritating detail, those innermost spaces into which the artist withdrew to
create it." Marcel Pronst, A l'Ombre des jeunes fiUes en fleurs (Paris), vol. 2,
pp. 62-63."                                                                    [Sl1,l]

Battlefield or hazaar? ��In former times, we may recan, there was, in literature, a
movement of generous and disinterested activity. There were schools and leaders
of schools, parties and leaders of parties, systems comhating other systems, intel­
lectual currents and countercurrents . . . -a passionate, militant literary life . . . .
Ah yes, around 1830, I should say, all the men of letters used to glory in being
soldiers on an expedition, and what they required of puhlicity they got, in the
shadow of some banner or other, from the proud summons to the field of bat­
tle . . . . What remains to us today of all this hrave show? Our forefathers fought
the good fight, and we-we manufacture and sell. Amid the confusion of the pre­
sent, what is most clear to me is that in place of the battlefield have come myriad
shops and workshops, where each day sees the production and vending of the
newest fashions and what, in general, is known as the Paris article. " ��Yes, modiste
is the word for our generation of thinkers and dreamers." Hippolyte Babon, Les
Payens innocents (Paris, 1858), pp. vii-viii (,,"Lettre a Charles Asselinean").

i."I boldly declare myself the friend of Argand lamps; these, to tell the truth, are
content with shedding light and do not dazzle the eyes. Much less volatile than gas,
their oil never causes explosions; with them we breathe more freely, and the odor
is less offensive. Truly incomprehensible to me is the existence of all those shop­
keepers who, entrenched in our arcades, remain-at aU hours and in the warmest
of weathers-within shops where, on account of the gas, it feels like the Tropics."

was now used instead of oil. New street lamps took the place of the older appara­

On the ladies of the cash register: "All day long they go about in hair curlers and

and the fairy tale of the prince with golden hair and the enchanting princess, a
comparison the more admissible inasmuch as Parisian women enchant more than
they are enchanted." Eduard Kroloff, Schilderungen aus Paris (Hamburg, 1839),

dering lamps provided no security at all to the city, and the carriers beat up the
people they were accompanying on more than one occasion. Lacking anything
better, however, the city used them; and they were used so long that they were still

" In matters of municipal administration, the two great works of the Restoration
were gas lighting and the creation of omnibuses. Paris was illuminated in 1814 by
5,000 street lamps, serviced by 142 lamplighters. In 1822, the government decided
that streets would be lit by gas in proportion as the old contracts came due. On
June 3, 1825, the Compagnie du Gaz Portatif Fran9ais undertook, for the first
time, to light up a square: the Place Vendome received four multiple-jet street
lamps at t.he corners of the column and two street lamps at the corners of the Rue
de Castiglione. In 1826, there were 9,000 gas burners in Paris; in 1828� there were
10,000, with 1,500 suhscribers, three gas companies, and four gas-jet factories,
one of which was on the Left Bank. " Dubech and d'Espezel, Histoire de Paris,

From an eighteenth-century prospectus, ��Lighting Project, Proposed by Strn­
scription for Decorating the Famous Thoroughfare of the Boulevard Saint­
Antoine" : "The Boulevard will be illuminated by a garland of Lanterns that will
extend on both sides between the trees. This illumination will take place twice
weekly, on Thursdays and Sundays, and, when there is a Moon, on the days after
the abovementioned weekdays. Lighting will begin at ten o'clock, and all will be
illuminated by eleven . . . . Since this sort of evening Promenade is suited only to
Lords and Men of Wealth who have carriages, it is only to them that we offer this
subscription. Subscription for this year is at the rate of 18 pounds for each House;
in subsequent years, however, it will cost only 12 pOWlds, the 6 additional pounds
this year being for the initial expenses of installation" (p. 3). "The Cafes and
Theaters that border this famous promenade are justly celebrated; Yes-I say this
to their glory-it was the handsome Lanterns adorning their illustrious Booths
that gave me the idea of universal Illumination. The celebrated Chevalier Servan­
doni has promised me designs for the Arcades , for the Garlands, and for the
elegant Monograms, designs worthy of his fecund genius. Is there a single one of
our wealthy style-setters who does not heartily support this brilliant Project?

style. The walls of the main room were entirely covered b y mirrors set between
gilded columns. The cashier sits at all times behind a large and sumptuous table
placed upon a platform; before her is silverware, fruits, flowers, sugar, and the
box for the gan;ons. It is customary for every paying customer to leave a small
gratuity for the waiter; this is thrown by the latter into the box. Its contents are
later equally divided." Eduard Devrient, BrieJe aus Paris (Berlin, 1840), p. 20.

Between the February Revolution and the June Insurrection: " When the cluh
meetings were over, workers took to the streets, and the sleeping bourgeois were
either awakened by cries of 'Des lampions! Des lampions! ' in consequence of
which they would have to light their windows; or else wanton gunshots roused
them from their beds in terror. . . . There were endless torchlight processions
through the streets of Paris, and on one occasion it happened that a girl allowed
herself to be undressed and shown naked to the crowd by torchlight; for the
crowd, this was merely a reminiscence of the Goddess of Liberty of the first French
Revolution . . . . At one point the prefect of police, Caussidiere, issued a proclama­
tion against these torchlight processions-but the edict terrified the citizenry of
Paris still more, because it stated that the people were supposed to brandish
torches only in the event of some threat to the republic. " Sigmund Englander,

night, climbing up and clown with the aid of an extendable rope kept locked in a
toolbox during the day-since gas, which for some years had been blazing in
English towns, had yet to he supplied. The merchants who sold the oil and the
Argancllamps wished to avoid all favorable mention of this other source of light,

Apropos of an institute for the blind and the insane, this excursus on electric light:
"I come now to the facts. The bright light of electricity served, at first, to illumi­
nate the subterranean galleries of mines; after that, public squares and streets;
then factories, workshops, stores, theaters, military barracks; finally, the domes­
tic interior. The eyes, initially, put up rather well with this penetrating new enemy;
but, by degrees, they were dazzled. Blindness began as something temporary, soon
became periodic, and ended as a chronic problem. This, then, was the first re­
sult-sufficiently comprehensible, 1 believe; but what about the insanity lately
visited on our leaders?-Our great heads of finance, industry, big business have
seen fit . . . to send . . . their thoughts around the world, while they themselves
remain at rest . . . . To this end, each of them has nailed up, in a corner of his
office, electric wires connecting his executive desk with our colonies in Africa,
Asia, and the Americas. Comfortably seated before his schedules and account
books, he can communicate directly over tremendous distances; at a touch of the
finger, he can receive reports from all his far-flung agents On a startling variety of
matters. One branch-correspondent tells him, at ten in the morning, of a ship­
wrecked vessel worth over a million . . . ; another, at five after ten, of the unex­
pected sale of the most prosperous house in t.he two Americas; a third, at ten after
ten, of the glorious entrance, into the port of Marseilles , of a freighter carrying the
fruits of a Northern California harvest. All this in rapid succession. The poor
brains of these men, robust as they were, have simply given way, just as the
shoulders of some Hercules of the marketplace would give way if he ventured to
load them with ten sacks of wheat instead of one. And this was the second result."

the reservoir located above the wick, whence the oil dripped down-consisted in

letters hegan with the establishment of street. light.s. 'Before this period,' he once
said, 'everyone returned home early, from fear of losing their lives, and this fact
worked to the advant.age of labor. Nowadays, people stay out at. night, and work
less. ' Surely there is t.rut.h in this ohservation and the invention of gas is not likely

A la petite vertu" <The Strolling Sultanas of Night against Our Lords the Street
Lamps: To Easy Virtue > , 1769:
The poor woman finds, instead
Of lovers, only lampposts
In this dazzling town,
Once a second Cythera.
Where nymphs would walk.
Tender mothers of delight,
They are forced today
To squeeze themselves into a box,
In other words, an octogenarian fiacre,
Which, by way of B., or F., takes them
To where fiacres have nothing to do. , , .
Misericordia, when once the night
Will let you leave the hovel;
For life is so needy.

"""What a splendid invention this gas lighting is!' Gottfried Semper exclaims. "In

machines . . . . The mentality of entrepreneurs, economically speaking, was still
conservative; otherwise, the import duty on steam engines, which were not yet

raised to 30 percent of the value. French industry at the time of the Restoration

"At the time of the Revolution, a new element began to appear in Paris: large-seale
industry. This was a consequence of the disappearance of feudal guilds; of the
l'eign of unfettered liberty that followed in their wake; and of the wars against
England, which made necessary the production of items previously procured by
import. By the end of the Empire, the evolution was complete. From the revolu­
tionary period on, there were factories established for the production of saltpeter,
firearms, woolen and cotton fabrics, preserved meat, and small utensils. Mechani­
cal spinning mills for cotton and linen were developed, with the encouragement of
Calonne, beginning in 1785; factories for the production of bronze were con­
structed under Louis XVI; and chemical and dying companies were founded by the
Count d'Al'tois in Javel. Didot Saint-Leger ran a new machine for paper produc­

·'Although the worker associations were all run in exemplary fashion, ably and

disapproval. Most of the bourgeoisie would feel a certain apprehension in passing
before one of the houses that bore the sign . . . and the emblem of a worker
association. Though these shops were distinguished from other, similar businesses
only b y the inscription 'Association fraternelle d'ouvriers: Liberte, Egalite,
Fraternite,' on the petit bourgeois they had the effect of snakes in the grass that
might suddenly strike at any time. It sufficed for the bourgeois to think of the
February Revolution, which had been the origin of these associations . . . . For
their part, the associations of workers made every possible effort to conciliate the
bourgeoisie, hoping to gain its support. It was for this reason that many of them
furnished their shops in the most splendid manner, so as to draw their share of
customers. The privations which the workers thus laid upon themselves, in an
effort to withstand the competition, are beyond belief. While that part of the shop
which was open to the public was fitted out in the costliest way, the worker himself

after carefully perusing his Constitutionnel . . . , negligently folds it and puts it in

like, I will give you, in exchange for the paper you've just finished, Le Peuple, by
citizen Proudhon, and its supplement containing a serial by the famous M€mars­
Senneville. ' The hourgeois allows himself to he persuaded. What good is a Consti­

Poet.ry of Saint-Simonianism: "In the preface to the first volume of Le Productem;
A. Cerclet launches an urgent. appeal to art.ists . . . . And Buchez, who later suc­
ceeded to the leadership of the cooperative movement, appealed to the community
of artists in similar terms . . . . It was Buchez who first observed . . . that classicism
and romanticism share equally in the world with which they-the Saint-Simoni­
ans-are occupied, just as legitimacy and liberalism divide between themselves the
political world . . . . In 1825, a monument was erected to the builder of the Langue­
doc Canal, Pierre Riquet. On this occasion, Soumet composed a stirring
hymn . . . . The literary chronicler for Le Producteur, Leon Halevy, brother of the
famous composer, hailed these verses, which he characterized as 'industrial po­
etry.' . . . Soumet, however, only partly fulfilled the hopes which the Saint­
Simonians had placed in him. If later on, in his Divine Epopee, one can still hear
the hammer's clang and the noisy grinding of the gears of industrial labor, it is
precisely here, in the poet's greatest work, that the propensity for metaphysical
abstr�H�tions is manifest . . . . Halevy, moreover, was himself a poet . . . . In 1823
Halevy published his Poesies europeennes, . . . and in 1831 wrote an ode to Saint­
Simon, who had died in 1825 . " H. Thurow, " Aus den Anfangell der sozialistischen

On a review by Sainte-Beuve in the Revue des deux mondes, Fehruary 15, 1833:
" The verses which Sainte-Beuve . . . reviewed were the literary remains of a poet
hy the name of Bruheille, who died very young. . . . In his account, furthermore,
Sainte-Beuve draws attention to a novel which bore the characteristic title La
Saint-Simonienne. and which . . . demonstrates the triumph of the Saint-Simonian
idea. That the author, a certain Madame Le Bassu, brings about this triumph
through a rather improhahle course of events-namely, the transfusion of blood
from the veins of a youth infected with Saint-Simonian doctrine into those of his
eedesiastically educated beloved-may be regarded in essence as an artistic expe­
dient; at the same time, however, it brings out the mystical side of Saint-Simonian­
ism. This mystical element had, shortly before, found stark expression during the
sojourn by the 'family' in their last place of refuge, on the Rue Mfmilmontant. This
coneluding episode in the life of the movement likewise engendered a correspond­
ing literature-poems, songs, spiritual exercises in verse and prose-whose enig­
matic symholism could he understood only by the few initiates . . . . Thrown off
course by the violence of political and economic developments, Saint-Simonianism
had run aground on metaphysics.'� H. Thurow, "Aus den Anfangen der sozialistis­

their coats in the back so as to be reminded, while dressing, of their reliance on

From a report on the November 1911 issue of the journal of Austrian social democ­

He was known as a ' socialise at a time when this word meant something entirely
different from what it means today. . . . As far as the class struggle is concerned, he
sees only the opposition of industrialism to the old regime; bourgeoisie and work­
ers he considers together as a single industrial class, whose richer members he
calls upon to take an interest in the lot of their impoverished fellow workers.

the shortcomings of the book contributed to its immediate effect. Its literary,
sometimes even high-flown, style secured for it a large public and was, at any rate,
refreshing after long years of abstract and ahstruse Hegelianizing. The same is
true of its extravagant deification of love, which, coming after the now intolerahle
sovereign rule of 'pure reason,' had its excuse . . . . But what we must not forget is
that it was precisely these two weaknesses of Feuerbach that 'true socialism,'
which had heen spreading like a plague in 'educated' Germany since 1844, took as
its starting point, putting literary phrases in the place of scientific knowledge, the
liberation of mankind by means of 'love' in place of the emancipation of the

"Railroads . . . demanded, besides other impossibilities, a transformation in the
mode of property. . . . Up until then, in fact, a bourgeois could run an industrial
or a business concern with only his own money, or at most with that of one or two
friends and acquaintances . . . . He managed the money himself� and was the actual         �
proprietor of the factory or business establishment. But railroads had need of
such massive amounts of capital that it could no longer be concentrated in the
hands of only a few individuals. And so a great many bourgeois were forced to
entrust their precious funds, which had never before been allowed out of their
sight, to people whose names they hardly knew. . . . Once the money was given
over, they would lose all control over its investment and could not expect to claim
any proprietary rights over terminals, cars, locomotives, and the like . . . . They
were entitled only to a share of the profits; in place of an object, . . . they were
given . . . a mere piece of paper that represented the fiction of an infinitely small
and ungraspable piece of the real property, whose name was printed at the bottom
in large letters . . . . This procedure . . . stood in such violent contrast to what the
hourgeoisie was used to . . . that its defense could be undertaken only by people
who . . . were suspected of wanting to overthrow the order of society-socialists, in
short. First Fourier and then Saint-Simon extolled this mobilization of property in

''"It is not in proletarian circles, not even in democratic circles, that the initial
impetus . . . for the establishment of labor exchanges is to be found. The idea was
first advanced in 1842 by M. de Molinari, editor-in-chief of Le Journal des econo­
mistes. It was Molinari himself who developed this idea in an article he . . . wrote
entitled 'L'Avenir des chemins de fer' <The Future of the Railroads> . In order to
indicate just how much times had changed, he referred to Adam Smith, who had
said, in effect, that labor was the commodity most difficult to transport. Against
this, he affirmed that labor power had now become mohile. Europe and the whole
world now stands open to it as a market. . . . The main point of the conclusion
whi{�h Molinari drew in '"L'Avenir des chemins de fer,' in favor of the institutions
that were to serve as labor exchanges, was the following: the principal cause for
the low rate of wages is the frequently recurring disproportion hetween the num­
her of workers and the demand for work; contributing further to the problem is
the high concentration of workers population in certain centers of production . . . .
Give to workers the means . . . by which they can change their plaee of residence at
low cost; give them, too, the possibility of knowing where they will be able to find
work in the most favorable circumstances . . . . If workers begin traveling quickly
and, ahove all, cheaply, labor exchanges will soon arise." On the proposal to
create a labor report: (''"This proposal, which was published in Le Coun'ier
fraru;ais, edited by Xavier Durdeu, turned matters directly to the workers . . . :
'We would like . . . to render a service to workers by publishing in our columns,
next to the stock market quotations, a list of work available . . . . What is the
purpose of stock market quotations? They report, as we know, the rate of ex­
change of government securities and shares of stock . . . on various markets
around the world . . . . Without the aid of these market reports, the capitalists
would often have no idea where to invest their money; without these lists, they
would find themselves in the same situation as workers who . . . have no idea where
to go to find work . . . . The worker is a vendor of work, and, as such, he has a very
material interest in knowing what the market outlets are for his goods.'" Louis

Notable difference between Saint-Simon and Marx.The fomler fixes the number
of exploited as high as possible, reckoning among them even the entrepreneur
because he pays interest to his creditors. Marx, on the other hand, includes all
those who in any way exploit another-even though they themselves may be
victims of exploitation-anlong the bourgeoisie.                                [U4,2]

according to the provisions of this treaty, customs duties were considerably low­

��Saint-Simon lingers over the history of the fifteenth-eighteenth centuries, and
gives to the social classes of this period a more concrete and specifically economic
description. Hence, it is this part of Saint-Simon's system that is of' greatest impor­
tance for the genesis of' the theory of class struggle, and that exercises the strongest
influence on its subsequent development. . . . Although, for later periods, Saint­
Simon emphasizes the economic moment in his characterization of classes and the
causes of their growth and decline . . . , in order to be consistent he would have
had to see, in this economic activity, the true roots of' the social classes as well. Had
he taken this step, he would inevitably have attained to a materialist conception of
history. But Saint-Simon never took this step, and his general conception remains
idealist. . . . The second point that is so surprising in Saint-Simon 's class theory, in
view of its discrepancy with the actual relations among the classes of' the period, is
the representation of' the class of industrialists as homogeneous . . . . The mani­
festly essential differences that exist: between proletarians and entrepreneurs are
for him external, and their antagonism is grounded in mutual misunderstanding:
the interests of the directors of industrial enterprises, in reality, coincide with the
interests of the masses . . . . This entirely unfounded assertion resolves for Saint­
Simon the very real social contradiction, salvaging the unity of the indust.rial class
and, with it, the perspective on a peaceful building-up of the new social system."

individuals, for with a system in which the immediate goal is the well-being of the
many, there ought. not to be any energy wasted on maintaining power over these

ing order can then easily become . . . a task shared by all citizens � whether it be to

domination of men, the state system becomes a system for the administration of

so as, through the cult, to restructure humanity in the spirit of Christian morals."

"0 Poets! You have eyes, but you do not see-and ears, but you do not hear!
Great things are unfolding in your midst, and you give us war chants!" [There
follows a characterization of the warlike inspiration for "La Marseillaise;'] "This
hymn to blood, these frightful imprecations bear witness not to any danger that
might be threatening the country, but to the impotence of liberal poetry-poetry
without inspiration beyond that of war, stmggle, and endless complaint. ... 0
people! Sing, nonetheless, sing "La Marseillaise;' since your poets are silent or
can only recite a pale imitation of the hymn of your fathers.Sing! The harmony
of your voices will yet prolong the joy with which triumph had filled your soul;
for you, the days of happiness are few and far between! Sing! .. .Your joy is sweet
to those in sympathy with you! It has been so long since they heard anything but
moans and groans from your lipsP' "Religion Saint-SimomelU1e: La Marseillaise"
(extract from L'Organisateur, September 1 1 , 1830) [according to the catalogue of
the Bibliotheque Nationale, the author is Michel Chevalier], pp.3-4. The ani­
mating idea of this rhapsody is the conlrontation of the peaceful July Revolution
with the bloody Revolution of 1789. Hence, this observation: "Three days of
combat sufficed to overturn the throne of legitimacy and divine right....Victory
went to the people, who live from their labors-the rabble that crowds the
workshops, the populace that slaves in misery, proletarians who have no prop­
erly but their hands: it was the race of men so utterly despised by salon dandies
and proper folk. And why? Because they sweat blood and tears to get their bread,
and never strut about in the balcony of the Comic Opera. After forcing their way
into the heart of the palace, . . . they pardoned their prisoners . . .; they ban­
daged the wounded.. . . Then they said to themselves: 'Oh, who will sing of our
exploits? W ho will tell of our glory and our hopes?'" ("La Marseillaise;' as
above, p. 1).                                                                 [U7,31

From a reply to an unfriendly review (in La Revue de Paris) of Charles Pradier's
literary labors: "For three years now, we have been appearing daily on the city's
sidewalks, and you probably think we have grown accustomed to it all. . . .Well,
you are nustaken. In fact, every time we step up on OUf soapbox, we hesitate and
look around us for excuses; we find the weather unpropitious, the crowds inat­
tentive, the street too loud.We dare not admit that we ourselves lack daring....
And now, perhaps, you understand . ..why sometimes we exult in the thought of
our work; ... and why, seeing us filled with enthusiasm, . . . you-and others
with you-could take it for undue pride;' Ch.Pradier, "Reponse it La Revue de
Paris," in Le Boheme, Charles Pradier, editor-in-chief, vol. 1 , no. 8 ( June 10,
1855). The passage is entirely characteristic of the bearing-at once honest and
uncertain-of this newspaper, which did not make it past its initial year of publi­
cation. As early as the first issue, it marks itself off from the lax, morally emanci­
pated boheme and makes mention of the pious Hussite sect, the Freres Bohemes,
founded by Michel Bradacz, which it would like to ensure a literary posterity.

From a confrontation between the underclass intellectuals and the ruling-class

"Do me the kindness of walking through the gambling dens, the little restaurants

seem, to commend the hoasting of Dumas pere or to excuse the indifference of
some of his friends toward younger writers; but I declare to you that the greatest
enemies of those who have heen deprived of a literary legacy are not the writers of
renown, the monopolizers of the daily feuilleton, but rather the falsely disinher­

It is significant that Le Bohiime, which looks after the rights of the literary proletar­

fit, in an article entitled "Du Roman en general et du romancier moderne en

Paul Saulnier (vol. 1, no. 5), to condemn the practice of "slavers;' Monsieur de
Santis, as the novelist in vogue is named here, returns hOllle after a day spent in
idleness. "Directly upon his arrival home, Monsieur de Santis locks himself in . . .
and goes to open a little door hidden behind his bookcase.-He finds himself,
then, in a sort of little study, dirty and quite poorly lit. Here, with a long goose
quill in his hand, with his hair standing on end, is a man with a face at once
sinister and unctuous,-Oho! with this one, you can tell froll1 a mile away he's a

"In 1852 the brothers Pereire, two Portuguese Jews, founded the first great mod­

�'Boheme <bohemian> belongs to the vocabulary in use around 1840. In the lan­

it means someone who is light-hearted and unconcerned with the morrow, lazy and
boisterous." Gabriel Guillemot, Le Boheme (Paris, 1868), pp. 7-8; cited in Gisela

Gisela Freund (p. 64) underlines the difference hetween the first generation of'
hohemians-Gautier, Nerval, Nanteuil-who were often of solid hourgeois origin,
and the second: "'Murger was the son of' a concierge-tailor; Champfleury was the
son of a secretary in the town hall of Laon; Barhara, the son of a sheet-music
seller; Bouvin, the son of a village policeman; Delvau, the son of a tanner in the
Faubourg Saint-Marcel; and Courbet was the son of a quasi-peasant." To this
second genel'ation belonged N adar-the son of a poor printer. (He was later, for a

"M. de Martignac bequeathed . . a troubled legacy to the newspapers, with his
law of July 1828-a law that was more liheral, to he sure, hut which, by making
. . . dailies or periodicals more accessible to all, burdened them with certain finan­
cial ohligations . . . . 'What will we do to covel' the new expenses?' demanded the
newspapers. 'Well, you will run advertisements,' came the response . . . . The con­
sequences of advertising were quick to emerge and seemingly endless. It was all
very well to want to separate, in the pages of the newspaper, t.hat which remained
conscientious and independent from that which hecame partisan and mercenary;
but the houndary . . . was quickly crossed. The advertisement served as bridge.
How could one condemn, five minutes before, . . . what five minutes afterward
'"
00   proclaimed itself the wonder of the age? The fascination of capital letters, which
"'
were growing ever larger, carried advertising away: it was the magnetic mountain
that threw off the compass . . . . This wretched advertising had an influence no less
fatal to the hook trade. . . . Advertising represented . . . a doubling of ex-
penses . . . : one thousand francs for promoting a new work. Because of this rise in
costs, moreover, hook dealers merdlessly demanded from authors two volumes
inst.ead of one-volumes in octavo rather than in smaller format, for that did not
cost any morc to advertise . . . . Advertising . . . would require a whole history unto
itself: Swift, with his vitriolic pen, would be the one to write it." On the word
reclame < advertisement> , the following remark: �'For those who may not know the
facts, we merely observe that the reclame is the little notice slipped into the news­
paper near the end, and ordinarily paid for by the bookseller; inserted on the
same day as the advertisement, or on the day following, it gives in two words a
brief' and favorable judgment that helps prepare the way for that of the review."

Graphics from 1830 display readily, and often allegorically, the conflict of the
newspapers anlong one another. They love to show, in this smne period, what
happens when several people have to share in reading one newspaper. They
picture the struggle that arises on this occasion, whether it be over possession of
the paper or over the opinions it purveys. Cabinet des Estampes, a plate from

The idea that newspaper advertisements could be made to serve the distribution
not only of books but of industrial articles stems from Dr. Veron, who by this
means had such successes with his Pate de Regnauld, a cold remedy, that an
investment of 17,000 francs yielded him a return of 100,000. "One can say,
therefore, . . . that if it was a physician, Theophraste Renaudot, who invented
journalism in France . . . , it was Dr. Veron who, nearly balf a century ago,

him: '�There was among them a man of godlike comportment who was named

of cathedrals . . . . If it is true, as we hear, that the word �religion' comes from

"The government wanted, on its own, to eonstruct the railway system. There were
various disadvantages to this course of action, . . . but, in the end, it would have
given us railroads. The idea occasioned a terrific explosion; political rivalries
dominated the scene. Science itself . . . came ont in support of the spirit of system­

name to the plot against the railways. Construction by the state was thus rejected
by an overwhelming majority. This occurred in 1838. Favorably disposed, as it
was, toward the project, the government now turned to private industry. Take
these marvelous thoroughfares, it said; I am offering you the concession for them.
And no sooner were these words out than a new storm at'ose. What! The bankers,
the capitalists are going to reap a fortune from this venture! . . . It is feudalism
reborn from its own ashes!-The plans to offer concessions to companies were
accordingly withdrawn, . . . or else spiked with clauses that made aeceptance im­

Theory of art in Saint-Simoniamsm. It rests on the division of history "into Or­
ganic or religious ages and Critieal or irreligious ages . . . . The course of history
treated in this work comprises two organic ages-the first constituted under the
reign of Greek polytheism, the second under that of Christianity-and, in the
wake of these organic ages, two critical ages, of which one extends from the era of
Greek philosophy to the advent of Christianity, and the other from the end of the
fifteenth century to the present." [E. Barrault,] Au-x artistes: Du. Passe et de

Universal history appears, to the Saint-Simonian Barrault, as the new work of
art: "Shall we venmre to compare the last of the tragic or comic authors of Rome
with the Ghristian orators intoning their eloquent serruons? No, Gorneille, Ra­
cine, Voltaire, and Moliere will not come back to life; dramatic genius has accom­
plished its mission . . . . In the end, the novel will fail no less in respect of what it
has in common with these two genres as in its relations to the history of which it
is the counterfeit. . . . History, in fact, will again take on a powerful charm . . . ; it
will no longer be only a little tribe of the Orient that will make for sacred history;
the history of the entire world will merit this title. Such history will become a
veritable epic, in which the story of every nation will constitute a canto and the
story of every great man an episode;' [E. Barrault,] Aux artistes: Du Passe et de
I'avenir des beaux-arts (Paris, 1830), pp. 81-82. The epic belongs to the organic
age; the novel and drama, to the critical.                                        [U16,l}

Barrault already has a vague idea of the inlportance, for art, of secularized cultic
elements, altllough he puts the emphasis on periods that are consolidated
through cult: "Although Greece never fostered a religious caste system like that of
the Orient, its epic represented nothing less than an initial separation of poetry
from cult. . . . Should orthodox movements survive into the critical periods, the
course of these periods is imperceptibly drawn back into the bosom of ortho­
doxy." [E. Barrault,] Aux artistes: Du Passe et de I'avenir des beaux-arts (Paris,
1830), pp. 25-26.                                                           [U16,2]

With reference to Guizot, whose brochure, "Du Gouvernement de la France et

centuries-old struggle of a class (of course, his work De Ia Democratie [paris, 1849]
sees in the class struggle, which has meanwhile arisen between bourgeoisie and
proletariat, only a misformne) , Plekhanov portrays the visions of the socialist
utopians as, " theoretically no less than practically;' a great step backward. "The
reason for this lay in the weak development of the proletariat at that time;'

and it was due more to them than to the army that Louis Philippe was able to
remain on his throne . . . . Whatever the reason-whether simple old age or a
species of lassitude-it was always the bourgeoisie that wearied of this wasteful life
which made it necessary, every six months, for hosiers and cabinetmakers to take
up arms and shoot at each other. The hosiers, peaceful men, grew tired before the
cabinetmakers. This remark would suffice to explain the February Revolution."

"It goes without saying that the worker associations lost ground with the coup
d'etat of December 2, 1851 . . . . All the associations of workers, those who had
received subsidies from the government as well as the others, began by promptly
removing their signs, on which symbols of equality and the words 'Liberty, Frater­
nity, Equality' were inscribed; it was as though they had been shocked by the
blood of the coup. Hence, with the coup d'etat, there were still unquestionably
worker associations in Paris , but the workers no longer risked displaying t.his
name . . . . It would be difficult to trace the remaining associations, for it is not only
on the signboards hut also in the city's directory of addresses that the name
' Workers Association' is missing. Worker associations survive, after the coup
{Petat, only in the guise of ordinary commercial concerns. Thus, the former fra­
ternal association of masons is now going under the trade name 'Bouyer, Cohadon
& Co. ? ' the association of gilders that likewise once existed as such now operates as
the firm of 'Dreville, Thihout & Co.,' and, hy the same token, in every surviving
association of workers it is the managers who give their names to the business . . . .
Since the coup d'etat, not one of these associations has admitted a new memher;
any new memher would he regarded with undisguised suspicion. If even the cus­
tomers were each t.ime received with distrust, this was because one everywhere
sensed the presence of the police-and was the more justified in doing so as the
police themselves would often show up officially on one pretext or another." Sig-

offered his services as police agent to the government of Louis Philippe. It was
known that this poison of espionage in France had penetrated even into all the
pores of family life; but that a police agent, this most disgusting excrescence of the
old society, could have found his way to the leader of the vanguard of Icarians in
order t.o cause his ruin, and at the risk of going under himself, aroused consider­
ahle surprise. Hadn't police spies been seen in Paris fighting and dying on the

"With t.he development of proletarian conspiracies, the need arose for a division of
labor. The members were divided into occasional conspirators, conspirateurs
d occasion-that is, workers who engaged in conspiracy alongside their other em­
'



ployment, merely attending meetings and holding themselves in readiness to ap­
peal' at the pla(�e of assemhly at the leaders' eommand-and professional
conspirat.ors, who devoted all their energy to the conspiracy and made their living
from it . . . . The social situation of this class determines its entire character from
the outset. Proletarian conspiracy naturally affords them only very limited and
uncertain means of subsistence. They are therefore constantly obliged to dip into
the cash boxes of the conspiracy. A number of them also come into direct conflict
with civil society as such, and appear before the police courts with a greater or
lesser degree of dignity. Their precarious livelihood, dependent in individual cases
more on chance than on their activity, their irregulm' lives whose only fixed ports­
of-eall are the taverns of the marchands de vin (the conspirators' places of rendez­
vous), their inevitable acquaintanee with all kinds of dubious people, place them
in that social category which in Paris is known as the boheme. These democratic
hohemians of proletarian origin are therefore either workers who have given up
their work and have as a eonsequence become dissolute, or charaeters who have
emerged from the lumpenproletariat. and bring all the dissolute habits of that dass
with them into their new way of life . . . . The whole way of life of these professional
eonspirators has a most deeidedly hohemian character. Reeruiting sergeants for
the conspil'aey, t.hey go from marchand de vin to marchand de ·vin, feeling t.he
pulse of the workers, seeking out their men, cajoling them into the conspiracy and
getting either the society's treasury or their new friends to foot the bill for the liters
inevitably eonsumed in the process. Indeed, it is really the nwrchand de vin who
provides a roof over their heads. It is with him that. the eonspirator spends most of
his t.ime; it. is here he has his rendezvous with his eolleagues, with the members of
his section and with prospective reeruits; it is here, finally, that the secret meetings
of sections (groups) and seetion leaders t.ake plaee. The conspirator, highly san-
guine in character anyway like all Parisian proletarians, soon develops into an
absolute bwnbocheur <hoozer> in this continual tavern atmosphere. The sinister
conspirator, who in secret session exhibits a Spartan self-discipline, suddenly
thaws and is transformed into a tavern regular whom everybody knows and who
really understands how to enjoy his wine and women. This conviviality is further
intensified hy the constant dangers the conspirator is exposed to; at any moment
he may he called to the barricades, where he may be killed; at every turn the police
set snares for him which may deliver him to prison or even to the galleys . . . . At
the same time, familiarity with danger makes him utterly indifferent to life and
liberty. He is as at home in prison as in the wine shop. He is ready for the call to
action any day. The desperate recklessness which is exhibited in every insurrec­
tion in Paris is introduced precisely by these veteran professional conspirators,
the hammes de coups de main . They are the ones who throw up and command the
first barricades, who organize resistance, lead the looting of weapon-shops and the
seizure of arms and ammunition from houses ? and in the midst of the uprising
carry out. those daring raids which so often throw the government party into
confusion. In a word, they are the officers of the insurrection. It need scarcely be
added that these conspirators do not confine themselves to the general organizing
of the revolutionary proletariat. It is precisely their business to anticipate the
process of revolutionary development, to hring it. artificially to the crisis point, to
launch a revolution on the spur of the moment, without the conditions for a revo­
lution. For them, the only condition for revolution is t.he adequate preparation of
their conspiracy. They are the alchemists of the revolution, and are characterized
by exactly the same chaotic thinking and blinkered ohsessions as the alchemists of
old. They leap at inventions which are supposed to work revolutionary miracles:
incendiary hombs, dest.ruct.ive devices of magic effect, revolts which are expected
to be all t.he more miraculous and astonishing in effect as t.heir hasis is less ra­
tional. Occupied with such scheming, they have no other purpose than the most
immediate one of overthrowing the existing government, and. t.hey have the pro­
foundest contempt for the more t.heoret.ical enlightenment of the proletariat. ahout
their dass intercsts. Hence their pleheian rather than proletarian irritation at t.he
habits nairs ("'hlack frock cout.s")-people of a greater or lesser degree of educa­
tion who represent that aspect of the movement, hut from whom they can never
make themselves quite independent, since they are t.he official representatives of
the party. The habits noirs also serve, at times, as their source of money. It goes
without saying that the conspirators are ohliged to follow willy-nilly the develop­
ment of the revolutionary party. . . . The chief characteristic of the conspirators'
way of life is t.heir hattle with the police, to whom they have precisely the same
relationship as thieves and prostitutes." At. another point in this artide, we read
(in reference to Chenu �s report on Lucien de La Hodde that follows): "As we see,
this spy . . . turns out to be a political prostitute of t.he vilest kind who hangs ahout
in the street in the rain for the payment of his 'tip' hy the first offieer of the peace
who happcns to come along.?? '''On one of my noeturnal excursions,' recounts
Chenu, 'I noticed de La Hodde walking up and down the Quai Voltaire . . . . It was
raining in torrents, a circumstance which set me thinking. Was this deal' fellow de
La Hodde also helping himself from the cash box of the secret funds, by any
chance? . . . "Good evening, de -La Hodde, what on earth are you up to here at this
hour and in this fearful weather?" "'I am waiting for a t'ascal who owes me some
money, and since he passes this way every evening at this time, he is going to pay
me, or else" -and he struck the parapet of the embankment violently with his
stick. ' De La Hodde attempts to get rid of him and walks toward the Pont du
Carrousel. Chenu departs in the opposite direction, but only to conceal himself
under the arcades of the Institut <de France> . . . . 'A quarter of an hour later, I
noticed the carriage with two little green lamps . . . . A man got out; de La Hodde
went straight. up to him. They talked for H moment, and I saw de La Hodde make a
movement HS though putting money into his pocket. '" Marx and Engels, review of

The workers of 184<8 and the great Revolution: " Although the workers suffered
under the conditions created by t.he Revolution, they did not blame it for their
misery; they imagined that the Revolution had failed to bring about the happiness
of the masses because intriguers had perverted its founding principle. According
to their thinking, the gt'eat Revolut.ion was good in itself, and human misery could
be eliminated only if people were to resolve on a new 1793. Hence, they turned
away distrustfully from the socialists and felt drawn to the bourgeois republicans,
who conspired with the aim of estHblishing a republic by revolutionary means. The
secret soeieties in existence during the reign of Louis Philippe recruited a great
many of their most active members from the working class. " Paul Lafargue, "Del'
Klassellkampf in Frankreich," Die neue Zeit, 12, no. 2 (1894), p. 615.        [V3,1]

Marx on the "Communist League" : " 'As far as the secret doctrine of the I,eague is
concerned, it underwent all the transformations of French and English socialism
and communism, as well as their German versions . . . . The secret form of the
society goes hack to its Paris origins . . . . During my first. stay in Paris (from late
Octoher 1843 to February 1845), I established personal contact with t.he leaders of
the League living there, as well as with the leaders of the majorit.y of the secret
French worker associations-without, however, becoming a member of Hny of
them. In Brussels, . . . the London Cent.ral Authority entered into correspondence
with us and . . . sent . . . a watchmaker called Joseph Moll . . . to invite us to join
the League. Moll allayed our doubts . . . by revealing that the Central Authority
intended to convoke a Congress of the I,eague in London . . . . Accordingly? we
joined it. The Congress . . . took place, and, after heat.ed debate over several
weeks, it adopted the Man�festo o.fthe Communist Party, written hy Engels and
myself.' At. the t.ime Marx wrote these lines, he described their content as compris­
ing "histories long past and half forgotten.' . . . In 1860 the workers? movement,
suppressed by the counterrevolution of the 18508, was dormant. t.hroughout

movement's first period, which stretched from the July Revolution to the F    : ehru­
ary Revolution. . . . The most they could attain was theoretical clarification . . . . A
secret league of workers that, over the years, could accompany and intellectually
stimulate the English and French socialism of the day, as well as the reigning
German philosophy, will have displayed an energy of thought that deserves the
highest respect." "Ein Gedenktag des Kommunismus," Die neue Zeit, 16 , no. 1

" The practical programs of the communist conspirators of the period . . . set them
apart advantageously from the socialist utopians, thanks to the finn conviction
that the emancipation of the working class C"the people') is unthinkable without
struggle against the upper classes ("the aristocracy'). Of course, the struggle of a
handful of men who have hatched a conspiracy in the name of popular interests
can in no case be considered a class struggle. If, nevertheless, the majority of these
conspirators have come from the working class, then the conspiracy can be said to
constitute the germ of the revolutionary struggle of that class. And the conception
which the Society of Seasons:; has of the I. aristocracy' shows how closely the ideas
of the revolutionary communists in France, at that time, were connected to the
ideas of the bourgeois revolutionaries of the eighteenth century and the liberal
opposition during the Restoration . . . . Like Augustin Thierry, the French revolu­
tionary communists began with the idea that the struggle against the aristocracy
was necessarily in the interests of all the rest of society. But they rightly point out
that the aristocracy of birth has heen replaced by an aristocracy of money, and
that, as a result, the struggle . . . must be waged against the bourgeoisie." Georgi

"The Independents had their secret society, the Charbonnerie <Carbonari>, or­
ganized at the beginning of 1821 on the model of the Italian Carbonari. The
organizers were a wine merchant, Dugied, who had spent time in Naples, and a
medical student, Bazard. . . . Every member was required to contribute one franc
a month, to possess a gun and fifty bullets, and to swear to carry out blindly the
orders of his superiors. The Charbonnerie recruited among students and soldiers
in particular; it ended up numbering 2,000 sections and 40,000 adherents. The
Charbonniers wanted to overthrow the Bourbons, who had been 'brought back
by foreigners; and 'to restore to the nation the free exercise of its right to choose
a suitable government: They organized nine plots during the first six months of
1822; all failed." A. Malet and P. Grillet, XIX' Siede (Paris, 1919), p. 29. The
uprisings of the Carbonari were military revolts; they had, perhaps, a certain
analogy to those of the Decembrists.                                             [V4,1]

except for the military chiefs . . . . The Garde Nationale constituted . . . a veritable
army, numbering some 24.,000 men . . . ; this army was a police force . . . . Also,
care was taken to separate out the workers . . . . This was achieved by requiring
the Garde Nationale to wear uniforms and to pay its own expenses . . . . This bour­
geois guard, moreover, did its duty bravely in all circumstances. As soon as the
drums had sounded the call, each man would leave his place of work, while the
shopkeepers closed their stores, and, dressed in uniform, they would all go out to
j oin their battalion, not needing to muster." A. Malet and P. Grillet, XIX" Siecle

��The republicans had belonged, for the most part, to the Charbonnerie; against
Louis Philippe, they multiplied the number of secret societies. The most important
. . . was that of the Droits de l'Homme < Rights of Man>. Founded in Paris (where
it quickly grew to nearly 4,000 members), and modeled on the Charbonnerie, it
had branches in most of the major cities. It was this secret society that organized
the great insurrections in Paris and Lyons in June 1832 and April 1834. The
principal republican newspapers were La Tribune and Le National, the first di­
rected by Armand Marrast and the second by Armand Carrel. " Malet and Grillet,

Declaration of December 19, 1830, issued by students at the Ecole Polytechnique
to the editorial office of Le Constitutionnel: '''If any man among the agitators; they
say, 'is found wealing the uniform of the Ecole, that man is an impostor. . . . ' And
so they had these men tracked down wherever they appeared in the faubourgs in
the uniform of Polytechnicians, seeking to usurp the latter's influence. The best
way to recognize them, according to Bosquet, was to ask them the difforential qf
sine x or qflog x; 'if they respond appropriately, they are former students; if not,
we have them jailed:" G. Pinet, Histoire de l'Ecole polytechnique (Paris, 1887),
p. 187. Disturbances took place in connection with the trial against the ministers
of Charles X. G Pinet adds : "In supporting the interests of the bourgeoisie, those
with republican convictions seemed to fear they would be accused of deserting
the cause of the people" (p. 187). In a further proclamation, the school came out
decisively in favor of universal suffrage.                                  [V4a,1]


"The students go to their student societies, whether publicly or secretly organized,

The Societe des Droits de l'Homme < Society of the Rights of Man> employs, in its
pamphlets, the calendar of the great Revolution. In the month of Pluviose,9 year
42 of the Republican era, it counts 300 branch establishments throughout France,
163 in Paris alone, of which every one had its particular name. The wooing of the
proletarians by the bourgeoisie had the benefit �'that, instead of enlisting them
through humiliation or material services, through the offer of money or other
forms of assistance, it was by various attentions and tokens of respect, by joining
together in balls and fetes, that the leaders of the bourgeoisie worked to form
attachments with the workers." Charles Benoist, " L'Homme de 1848," part 1 ,

In the tightened organization of the secret societies after 1835, the mystagogic
element was intensified. The names of the days of the week and of the months
became codewords for assault detachments and commandos. An initiation cere­
mony influenced by freemasonry and reminiscent of the Vehme <medieval crimi­
nal tribunals> was introduced. According to de La Hodde, this ceremonial
already includes, among other things, the question: "Must one make a political
revolution, or a social revolution?" lO See Ch. Benoist, "L'Homme de 1848," part

compagnons, or tradesmen, and formed among themselves the core of a new soci­

Variously colored ribbons, worn in different ways, are insignia of the individual

(horseshoes, hammers, standard gauges, and the like), to which the different
trades lay exclusive claim. "The T-square and compass are emhlems of all the

was a sort of emissary of Prince Louis and so, in order t.o divert his attention and
to put an end to the conversation, I t.reated the whole affair as a joke. I asked him
what Louis Napoleon Gould give to Russia in return for the million he requil'es.­
"Every possible concession,' answered Mr. Campbell ? getting worked up. "Then

Adalbert von Bornstedt, who at that time was spying on radical writers and arti-

denouncing Marx and Hess, a gathering of this sort in the Avenue de Vincennes,
where regicide, hatred of the rich, and the aholition of private property were
openly advocated. ?? Gustav Mayer, Friedrich Engels, vol. 1 , Friedrich Engels in

Schlabrendorf gives an account of the popular comedian Bobeche, who could be
seen on the Boulevard du Temple. �'His stage is so narrow, however, that he has no
room to gesticulate when his brother-in-law, with whom he performs, is up there
with him. So he has to stick his hands in his pockets. The other day he exclaimed,
with reason: I must have a place, I absolutely must have a place!-But you surely
know that a place must be filled, that you must do some work and earn your

J . J . Weiss on the Club des HaIles: " The club met in a little room on t.he second
floor ahove a cafe; it had few members, and these were serious and thoughtful.
Think of the atmosphere of the Comedie Frallf;aise on days when Racine or Cor­
neille is performed; compare the audience on those days to the crowd that fills a
circus where acrobats are executing perilous leaps, and you will understand the
impression made on someone who ventured into this revolutionary club of Blan­
qui, compared with the impression made hy the two clubs in vogue with the party
of order, the club of the Folies-Bergere and that of the Salle Valentino. It was like
a chapel consecrated to the orthodox creed of classical conspiracy, where the
doors were open to all, but where you never felt like returning unless you helieved.
Mter the sullen parade of the oppressed who, every night, would present them­
selves at this tribunal in order always to denounce someone or something-the
conspiracy of hankers, an office manager, an administrator of the railroad-the
priest of the place would rise to his feet and, on the pl'etext of addressing the
sorrows of his congregation, the people (represented by the half-dozen furious
imbeciles who had just been heard), would clarify the situation. His appearance
was distinguished, his bearing irreproachable; his countenance was delicate, fine,
and composed, with a fierce and sinister flash that sometimes lit the small and
piercing eyes, which, in their usual state, were more benevolent than harsh. His
words were measured, colloquial, and precise; it was, along with that of M. Thiel's,
the least declamatory way of speaking I have ever heard. As to the content of his
speech, almost everything in it was just. . . . �Where, then, did Corneille learn the
art of war?' cried the Grand Conde at the first performance of Sertorius. Blanqui,
I would surmise, had no more studied war than had Corneille. But possessing, as
he did, the political faculty to a superlative degree, he could manage, . . . even in
military matters, all the signals that, when duly heeded, would have called forth
a salute." Cited in Gustave Geffroy, L 'Enfel'me (Paris, 1897), pp. 346-348.

January 1870, after the murder of Victor Noir: Blanqui has the Blanquists, pre­
sented by Granger, file by before him, without letting the fact be known. "He went
out, armed, bidding farewell to his sisters, and took up his post on the Champs­
Elysees. It was there, as Granger had announced to him, that he would find,
parading before him, the army of which he was the mysterious general. He recog­
nized the squadron leaders, as they came into view, and, behind each of them, he
saw the men grouped geometrically and marching in step, as though in regiments.
It was all done according to plan. Blanqui held his review-strange spectacle­
without arousing the slightest suspicion. Leaning against a tree, surrounded by the
crowd of onlookers, the vigilant old man saw his comrades pass by, orderly amid
the surging of the people, silent amid the steadily mounting uproar. Gustave

On the influence of Machiavelli, which Blanqui felt at Sainte-Pelagie: "In contrast
to the French Blanqui-so lucid, so intelligent, so ironic-there appeared, from
time to time, this old Italian Blanqui, denizen of Florence or of Venice, who put his
faith in tenebrous schemes and in the possible success of an act of force." Gustave

A type of conspirator characteristic of the 1840s: Daniel Bornle, a journeyman,
half crazy, but above all ambiguous. He worked on assigument from Vidocq,
who, for his part, took his orders from Caussidiere as much as from Louis
Napoleon. BOffile put the regiment of the Vesuvieffi1es on their feet; in 1848, he
was granted an audience, in the company of several Vesuvieffi1es, with Mme. de
Lamartine. Lamartine himself refused to have any dealings with the Vesuvien­
nes. There seems to have been a plan to set up workshops for them. BOlme
makes an appeal to the citoyennes on a poster dated February 28, 1848:
"To female citizens and patriots, my sisters in the Republic: . . . I have asked
the Provisional Goverrnnent to register you under the title of Vesuviennes. The
engagement will be for one year; to enlist, you must be between fifteen and
thirty, and unmarried. Apply at 14 Rue Sainte-Appoline, from noon to four

would announce their names. Blanqui saw in such perspicacity the mark of a

Each of these seekers after God
Takes an infinity upon his wing:

Sees nothing of their dreams.

'�The words of Jean Paul which I put at the head of this biography of Fourier-'Of
the fibers that vibrate in the human soul he cut away none, but rather harmonized
all'-these words apply admirably to this socialist, and in their fullest rcsonanee
apply only to him. One could not find a better way to characterize the phalanste­
dan philosophy." Ch. Pellarin, Notice bibliographique (1839), p . 60, cit.ed in

Fourier on his business career: " My hest. years were lost in the workshops of
falsehood, where from all sides t.he sinister augury rang in my ears: 'A very honest
boy! He will never be worth anything in business. ' Indeed, I was duped and
robbed in all that I undertook. But if I am wort.h nothing when it comes to pract.ic­
ing business, I am worth something when it comes to unmasking it." Charles
Fourier, 1820, Publication des manuscrits, vol. 1, p. 17, cited in A. Pintoche,
Fourier et Ie sociali$me (Paris, 1933), p. 1 5 . '                            [WI,2]

Fourier wanted '"'every woman to have, first of all, a husband with whom she could
conceive two children; second, a breeder (geniteur) with whom she could have
only one child; then, a lover (favorit) who has lived with her and retained this
title; fourth and last, mere possessors (possesseurs), who are nothing in the eyes of
the law. . . . A man who expressly says that a girl of eighteen who has not yet found
a man is entitled to prostitute herself; a man who directs that all girls he divided
into two classes, the juveniles (under eighteen) and the emancipated (over eight-
een), which last would have the right to take a lover and bear illegitimate children;
a man who . . . maintains that unmarried young women who give themselves up to
pleasure possess qualities superior to those of married women, . . . and describes
in great detail how an entire army of women should enter into prostitution under
the supervision of matrons-such a man does not understand the eternal bases of
humanity. " Sigmund EngHinder, Geschichte de,. franzosischen Arbeiter-Associa­
tionen (Hamburg, 1864), vol. 1 , pp. 245, 261-262.-In the same vein: '''What are
we to say of a system in whichfilles publiques are given the name bacchantes and in
which it is argued that they are just as necessary as vestal virgins, and that they
. . . exercise the virtue of fellowship? A system which describes in what manner
innocent young people are supposed to lose their innocence?" (ibid., pp. 245-24,6).

" Around 1803 or 1804, Fourier, who practiced the profession of commercial trav­
eler-or 'shop-sergeant,' as he preferred to call it-found himself in Paris. Hav­
ing before him a four-month wait for a position he had been promised, he looked
around for some means of occupying Iris time and hit upon the idea of searching
for a way to make all men happy. It was not with the expectation of obtaining any
practical results that he entered on this project, but purely as a jeu d 'esprit. "
Charles-M. Limousin, Le Fourierisme (Paris, 1898), p. 3 .                  [Wl,4]

"Fourier is so prodigal in his invention and his crazy descriptions that Lerminier
justifiably compares him to Swedenborg . . . . Fourier, too, was at home in all skies
and on all planets. After all, he calculated mathematically the transmigration of
the soul, and went on to prove that the human soul must assume 810 different
forms until it completes the circuit of the planets and returns to earth, and that, in
the course of these existences, 720 years must be happy, 45 years favorable, and 45
years unfavorable or unhappy. And has he not described what will happen to the
soul after the demise of our planet, and prophesied, in fact, that certain privileged
souls will retire to the sun? He reckons further that our souls will come to inhabit
all other planets and worlds, after spending 80,000 years on planet Earth. He
calculates, in addition, that this termination of the human race will occur only
after it has enjoyed the benefits of the boreal light: for 70,000 years. He proves that
by the influence, not of the boreal light, to be sure, hut of the gravitational force of
labor, . . . the climate of Senegal will become as moderate as summers in France
are now. He describes how, once the sea has turned to lemonade, men will trans­
port fish from the great ocean to t.h e inland seas, the Caspian, Aral, and Black
Seas, given that the horeal light reacts less potenlly with these salty seas; and so, in
this way, saltwater fish will accustom themselves gradually to the lemonade, until
finally they can be restored to the ocean. Fourier also says that, in its eighth
ascending period, humanity will acquire the capacity to live like fish in the water
and to fly like hirds in the air, and that, by then, humans will have reached a
height of seven feet and a life span of at least 144 years. Everyone, at that point,
will be able to transform himself into an amphibian; for the individual will have
the power of opening or closing at will the valve that connects the two chambers of
the heart, so as to bring the blood directly to the heart without having it pass
through the lungs . . . . Nature will evolve in such fashion, he maintains, that a time
will come when oranges blossom in Siberia and the most dangerous animals have
been replaced by their opposites. Anti-lions, anti-whales will be at man's service
then, and the calm will drive his ships. In this way, according to Fourier, the lion
will serve as the best of horses and the shark will be as useful in fishing as the dog
is in hunting. New stars will emerge to take the place of the moon, which already,
by then, will have begun to rot." Sigmund Englander, Geschichte der Jranzo­
sischenArbeiter-Associationen (Hamburg, 1864), vol. 1, pp. 240-244.              [WIa]

��Fourier, . . . in his last years, . . . wanted to found a phalanstery that would be
inhabited exclusively by dilldren aged three to fourteen, of which he aimed to
assemble 12 ,000; but his appeal went unheeded and the project was never real­
ized. In his writings he left a detailed plan, which specifically describes how the
ehildren must be raised so as to further the idea of association. From the moment
a child begins to walk, an attempt must be made to identify its tastes and passions,
and, by this means, to diseover its vocation. Children who show a liking for life in
the street, who make a racket and refuse to learn neatness and cleanliness, are
placed by Fourier in small bands which have eharge of the more unpleasant tasks
of the association. On the other side there are children in whom the taste for
elegance and luxury is inborn; these again Fourier arranges in a group, so that by
their presence on the scene the phalanx will not be lacking in luxury. . . . The
children are to become . . . great artists of song. Every phalanx, Fourier says, will
have 700 to 300 actors, musicians, and dancers, and the poorest canton in the Alps
or the Pyrenees will have an opera company at least as good as the Grand Opera of
Paris, if not much better. In order to foster the general sense for harmony, Fourier
would have the children already singing duets and trios in the nursery." Sigmund
Englander, Geschichte der franzosischen Arbeiter-Associationen (Hamburg,
1864), vol. 1 , pp. 242-243.                                                   [W2,I]

"Among the disciples of Fourier, one of the most entcrtaining was this Alphonse
Toussenel, who, in 1347 and 1352 respectively, published those works so popular
in their day, L 'Esprit des betes and Le Monde des oisectux . . . . Like Fourier, . . .
he sees in nature only animate beings: �The planets,' he affirms, �have great duties
to fulfill, first as members of the solar system, then as mothers of families. ' And he
voluptuously describes the amours of the Earth and the Sun: �As the lover dresses
in Iris most beautiful robes, and glosses his hair, and perfumes his language for the
visit of his love, thus every morning the Earth indues her richest attire to meet the
rays of her star beloved . . . . Happy, thrice happy the Earth, that no council of the
stars has yet thundcred its anathema against t.he immorality of the kisses of the
Sun!' . . . �Professors of the officially sanctioned physical sciences dare not speak
of the two sexes of electricity; they find it more moral to speak of its two poles . . . .
Such absurdities are beyond me . . . . If the fire of love did not kindle all beings,
metals and minerals as well as others, where, I ask, would be the reason for those
ardent affinities of potassium fot' oxygen, of hydrochloric acid for water?m

Fourier speaks "of the ascendancy of the principle of 'industrial passion' (fougue
industrielle), the universal enthusiasm that is ruled by the laws . . . of the 'com­
posite' or the ' coincident. ' On a cursory inspection, it might appear as though we
had reached this stage today. Industrial passion is represented by the rage to
speculate and the impulse to accumulate capital; the passion coi'ncidente (drive
toward incorporation), by the consolidation of capital, its increasing concentra­
tion. But even though the elements discovered by Fourier are present in this
relation, they are neither articulated nor regulated in the manner he envisioned
and anticipated." Charles Bonnier, " Das Fourier'sche Prinzip del' Anziehung,"

"We can see from his works that Fourier expected his theory to be accomplished
beginning in the year of their publication. In his Prowgomenes, he designates . . .
1822 as the year when the establishment of the experimental colony of the Harmo­
nian association was to be prepared. This colony was supposed to be actually
founded and put into practice the following year, whereupon 1824 would necessar­
ily see its general imitation by the rest of the civilized world. " Charles Bonnier,

"The political economists and politicians from whom the pre-1848 socialists had
learned were, in every case, opposed to strikes. They explained to the workers that
a strike, even though successful, would bring them no advantage, and that the
workers should put their money into cooperatives for production and consump­
tion rather than into plans for a strike." Proudhon "had . . . the ingenious idea of
inciting the workers to strike in order not to increase their wages but to lower
them . . . . In this way, the worker obtains two or three times more as a consumer
than he earns as a producer. �� < Paul> Lafargue, "Del' Klassenkampf in Frank­

" Fourier, Saint-Simon, and other reformers re(�ruited their followers ahnost ex­
clusively from the ranks of the artisans . . . and from the intellectual elite of the
bourgeoisie. With a few exceptions, it was educated people who gathered around
them, people who thought they had not received from society consideration
sufficient to their merits . . . . It was the declasses, those who had transformed
themselves into daring entrepreneurs, shrewd businessmen, or speculators . . . .
M. Godin, for example, . . . founded in Guise (in the departement of Aisne) a
Jamilistere according to Fourier's principles. In handsome buildings surrounding
a spacious, glass-covered square courtyard, he provided accommodations for nu­
merous workers from his plate-enameling factory; here they found, besides a
home, all necessary articles for daily use . . . , entertainments in a theater, con­
certs, schools for their children, and so on. In short, M. Godin saw to all their
physical and spiritual needs, and moreover realized . . . enormous profits. He
earned the reputation of being a benefactor of mankind, and died a multimillion­
aire. " Paul Lafargue, " Del' Klassenkampfin Frankreich, " Die neue Zeit, 12 � no. 2

Fourier on stocks and bonds: " In his T" aite de l'unite universelle, Fourier enu­
merates . . . the advantages which this form of property offers the capitalists: 'It
does not run the danger of being stolen or damaged through fire or earthquake.
. . . A minor never risks being taken advantage of in the administration of his
money, since that administration is the same for him as for every other share­
holdcr . . . ; a capitalist can realize his property at any moment, even though he
owned a hundred million'; and so forth . . . . On the other hand, 'the poor man,
though he have but one taler, can participate in the holding of public stock, which
is divided up into quite small portions, . . . and hence . . . can speak of our pal­
aces, onr storehouses, our wealth. ' Napoleon III and his cohorts in the coup el' etat
were very taken with these ideas; . . . they democratized state revenue, as one of
them put it, by making it possible to purchase bonds for five francs or even one
franc. By such methods, they thought to interest the masses in the solidity of
public credit and preclude political revolutions." Paul IJafargue, '''Marx' histor­

point (.June 15 , 1843): 'Yes, Pierre Leroux is poor, just as Saint-Simon and
Fourier were poor, and by the providential poverty of these great socialists the
world was enriched . . . . Fourier likewise had recourse to the charity of friends.
How often have I seen him scurrying past the columns of the Palais-Royal in his
shabby gray coat, both pockets laden so that out of one was peeping the neck of a
bottle and out of the other a long loaf of bread. The friend of mine who first
pointed him out to me drew my attention to the indigence of the man, who had to

"Herr Grun finds it an easy matter to criticize Fourier's treatment of love; he
measures Fourier's criticism of existing amorous relationships against the fanta­

German philistine, takes these fantasies seriously. Indeed, they are the only thing
which he does take seriously. It is hard to see why, if he wanted to deal with this
side of the system at all, Grun did not also enlarge upon Fourier's remarks con­

connection, the following: "When one considers the number of people in Paris

end of town to the other-one is rightly alarmed . . . . It must be recalled that, in

Fourier and Saint-Simon: " Fourier is more interest.ing and more diversified in his
economic analysis and in his crit.ique of the existing social order. But, t.hen, Saint­
Simon has the advantage over Fourier in his representations of future economic
development. Obviously, this development had to move . . . in t.he direct.ion of a
global economy . . . , and not in the direction of many self-sufficient little econo­
mies, such as Fourier imagined. Saint-Simon conceives the capitalist order . . . as
a step . . . , while Fourier rejects it in the name of the petty bourgeoisie." V. Volgin,

"In an exchange of views with the writer Camille Manclair, . . . Zola . . . declared
unequivocally that. he hore no love for collectivism; he found it smallhearted and
utopian. He was an anarchist rather than a socialist. . . . Utopian socialism, . . . as
he saw it, took its rise from the individual workshop, proceeded to the idea of the
association of producers, and aimed to achieve a communism of the general com-
munity. This was before 184·8 . . . . Zola, however, wanted to revive the method of
this period; he . . . took up the . . . ideas of Fourier, which were conditioned by the
embryonic relations of capitalist production, and attempted to ally them to the
modern form of this production, which had grown to gigantic proportions. ?? Franz

Fourier (in Le Nouveau Monde indus/n'el e/ socidaire, 1829) disapproves of the
contempt for gastronomy. "This gaucherie is yet another of those exploits of
morality calculated to turn us into enemies of our own senses, and into friends of
that commercial activity which serves merely to provoke the abuses of sensual
pleasure:' E. Poisson, Foun'er [contains selected texts] (Paris, 1932), p. 131. Thus,
Fourier here views immoral businesses as a complement to idealist morality. To
both he opposes his hedonistic materialism. His position recalls, from afar, that of
Georg Biichner. The words quoted above might have been spoken by Biichner's
Danton.                                                                        [W5,2]

"A phalanx does not sell a thousand quintals of flour of indifferent quality; it sells
a thousand quintals classified according to a scale of five, six, or seven varieties of
flavor, which it has tested in a hakery and distinguished in terms of the field where

nism will contrast sharply with the practices of our backward world, our civiliza­
tion so in need of perfecting. . . . We see among ourselves ? furthermore,
merchandise of inferior quality that is twenty times more abundant and more
easily sold than better-quality goods . . . . As a result of this circumstance, we can
no longer even recognize the inferior quality; morality accustoms the civilized to
eating the good and the bad indiscriminately. From this coarseness of taste follow
all the knaveries of mercantilism." TheOl'ie des quat1'e mouvements (1828), cited

"Knowing . . . that sometimes, in the region of the North Pole, there is generated
an electrical discharge which lights up those lands plunged in darkness for six
months of the year, Fourier announces that, when the earth shall have been ra­
tionally cultivated in all its parts, the aurora borealis will be continuous. Is this
absurd?" The author endeavors, following this, to provide an explanation: the
transformed earth will absorb less electricity from the SUll, and. whatever is not
absorbed will encircle it as a ring of Northern Lights. Charles-M. Limousin, Le

Worthy of note is the fact-to which Limonsin adverts-that, with Fourier, the
desire for possession is not a "passion:' This same commentator defines the
concept of passion mecanisante as that passion which govems the play of the
others. He remarks further (p. 15): "Fourier was surely wrong to make a joke of
duty;' Certainly apt is his observation (p. 17) that Fourier is more an inventor
than a scientist.                                                        [WSa,3]

On Fourier's machinal mode of conception. The table entitled "Mesh of the Lodg­
ments of Harmony" establishes, for apartments in street-galleries, twenty differ­
ent categories of rentals, priced from 50 to 1,000 francs, and offers, among others,
the following justification: ""This meshing of the six series is a law of the twelfth
passion. The simple progression, whether constantly increasing or decreasing,
would have very serious drawbacks. In principle, it would he false and deleteri­
ous, insofar as it was simple. . . . In application, it would he injurious, insofar as
. . . it gave to the hody of dwellings in the wings . . . the appearance of an inferior
class. Care must be taken to avoid this arrangement, which would be simple and
therefore detrimental to the meshing of the different classes."II Thus, within a
single section of the street-galleries, lodgers of different social standing will reside
together. "�I put off discussion of the stables . . . , about which I shall furnish . . .
ample dctails in special chapters to follow. For now, our concern is with lodg­
ments, of which one part alone-the street-gallery, the hall of universal linkage­
conclusively proves that, after 3,000 years of research into architecture, civilized
men have yet to learn anything about the bond of unity." Cited in E. Poisson,

Aspects of Fourierist number mysticism, according to Ferrari, "'Des Idees et de
l'ecole de Fourier" (Revu.e des deux mondes. 14" no. 3 [Paris, 1845]): ""Everything
indicates that Fourierism bases itself' on the Pythagorean harmony. . . . Its science
was the science of the ancients" (p. 397). '�Number reproduces its rhythm in the
evaluation of earnings'l (p. 398). The inhabitants of the phalanstery comprise 2 X
810 men and women; for "'the number 810 gives them a complete series of chords
corresponding to the multitude of cabalist assonances" (p. 396). ""If, with Fourier,
the science of the occult takes on a new form, that of industry, it should not be
forgotten that form per se counts for nothing in this airy poetry of the mys­
tagogies" (p. 405). �"Number groups all heings according to its symbolic laws; it
develops all the groups through series; the series distributes t.he harmonies
throughout. the universe . . . . For the series . . . is perfect throughout all of na­
ture . . . . Man alone is unhappy; hence, civilization inverts the number which
should govern him. Let us rescue it from civilization. . . . The order that domi­
nates physical movement-organic movement, animal movement-will thus radi­
ate in . . . passional movement; nature itself will organize the association"

"All his life, Fourier was engaged in thinking; but he never once asked himself
where his ideas came from. He portrays the hum�1ll being as a machine passion­

happiness." Ferrari, " Des Idees et de Pecole de Fourier," Revue des deux mondes,

world turns to its antitype, as dangerous and savage animals enter the service of
mankind: lions are used for delivering the mail. The aurora borealis reheats the
poles; the atmosphere, at the earth's surface, becomes clear as a mirror; the seas
grow calm; and four moons light up the night. In short, the earth renews itself
twenty-eight times, until the great soul of our planet (now enfeebled, exhausted)
passes on, with all its human souls, to another planet" (Ferrari, p. 401).    [W6,4]

Fourier's conception of the propagation of the phalansteries through "explo­

an innervation of the technical organs of the collective (analogy with the child

A take on the ideas of Fourier: <"King Clodomir, restored hy harmony to his natu­

of musk roses, of golden plums and fresh pineapples, and many another growing
thing . . . . He weds the vestal Antigone and follows her as trouhadour to join the
Hippocrene phalanx. ' And Louis XVI, instead of filling so pitiably the job of king
for which he was hardly cut out, makes magnificent door locks." Charles Louan­

"It is easy to understand that every 'interest' on the part of' the masses . . . goes far

these valueless relics, to reconstruct out of them a mass susceptible of being

Marx characterizes the insufficiency of Fourier, who conceived " a particular form

Fourierist pedagogy, like the pedagogy of Jean Paul, should be studied in the
context of anthropological materialism. In this, the role of anthropological mate­
rialism in France should be compared with its role in Germany. It might mm out
that there, in France, it was the human collective that stood at the center of
interests, while here, in Germany, it was the human individual. We must note, as
well, that anthropological materialism attained sharper definition in Germany
because its opposite, idealism, was more clearly delineated over there. The his­
tory of anthropological materialism stretches, in Germany, from Jean Paul to
Keller (passing through Georg Buchner and Gutzkow) ; in France, dle socialist
utopias and the physiologies are its precipitate.                           [W8,1]

hl cOlmection with Fourierist pedagogy, one should perhaps investigate the dia­

" According to him < Fourier> , souls transmigrate from hody to hody, and even
from world to world. Each planet possesses a soul, which will go to animate some
it   other, superior planet, carrying with it, as it does so, the souls of those people who
have inhabited it. It is thus that, before the end of our planet earth (which is
supposed to endure 81 ,000 years), the human souls upon it will have gone through
1,620 existences; they will have lived a total of 27,000 years on earth and 54,000
years on another planet. . . . In the exertions of its earliest infancy, the earth was
struck by a putrid fever that eventually spread to the moon, which died as a result.

Fourier's long-tailed men became the object of caricature, in 1849, with erotic
drawings by Emy in Le Rire. For the purpose of elucidating the Fourierist extrava­
gances, we may adduce the figure of Mickey Mouse, in which we find carried
out, entirely in the spirit of Fourier's conceptions, the moral ll10bilization of
nature. Humor, here, puts politics to the test. Mickey Mouse shows how right
Marx was to see in Fourier, above all else, a great humorist. The cracking open of
natural teleology proceeds in accordance with the plan of humor.           [W8a,5]

Affiliation of anti-Semitism with Fourierism. In 1845, LeJ Juifi rois <The Jewish

" The line . . . generally associated with the family group is the parabola. This
postulate is demonstrated in the work of the Old Masters, and above all in

results, in the oeuvre of Raphael, a hymn to the family, . . . masterful and . . .
divine. . . . The master thinker, who determined the analogies of the four conic
sections, has recognized the correspondence of the parahola and of familyism.

Raphael." D. Laverdant, De la Mission de l'art et du role des artistes: Salon de

Highly characteristic of the relation of the Fourierists to the Saint-Simonians is
Considerant's polemic against the railroads. 1ms polemic relies, for the most
part, on Hoene Wronski, Sur la Barbarie deJ chemins de fir et Jur la reforme
Jcienti/ique de la locomotion. Wronski's first objection is directed against the system
of iron rails; Considerant indicts "the process operating under the name 'railway
system; that is to say, the construction of very long flat roads equipped with
metallic rails and requiring enormous amounts of money and labor-a process
'not only opposed to the actual progress of civilization, but contrasting all the
more strongly with this progress in that it presents something truly ridiculous:
the barbarous contemporary reproduction of the massive and inert roadways of
the Romans' (Petition aux ChambreJ, p. 1 1);' Considerant opposes the "barbarous
means;' which is "simplistic," to the "scientific means," which is "composite"
(pp. 40-41). At another point, he says explicitly: "For this JimpliJme has led, just
as one would expect, to a result that is completely barbarian: that of the ever
more ineluctable leveling of roads" (p. 44). By the same token: "Horizontality is a
proper condition when it is a question of communications over water. The sys­
tem of terrestrial locomotion, on the other hand, evidently ought to be capable of
putting . . . different elevations in communication with one another" (p. 53). A
second and related objection of Wronski's is directed against travel on wheels,
which he describes as "a well-known and extremely vulgar process . . . , in use
since the invention of the chariot;' Here, too, he stresses the lack of any genuine
scientific and complex character. Victor Considerant, Deraisan et dangers de l'en­
gauement pour les chemins enflr (Paris, 1838). The contents first appeared, in large
part, in La Phalange.                                                        [W9,3]

Consi(H�rant argues that the work of engineers should he focused not on the im­
provement of the track hut on the improvement of the means of transport. Wron­
ski � to whom he refers, appears to be thinking primarily of an improved form of
wheel or of its replacement by something else. Thus, Considerant writes: "'Is it not
clear . . . that the discovery of a machine that would facilitate locomotion over
ordinary routes, and increase . . . the present speed of transportation on these
routes, would devastate, from top to hottom, the entire enterprise of' the rail­
roads? . . . Hence, a discovery not only possible but indeed probable can annihi­
late, at one blow and forever, the extraordinary amounts of capital that some
people have proposed be sunk into the railway system!" Victor Considerant,

Charles Gide on the "'divinatory genius" of Fourier : "'When he writes: "A certain
vessel from London arrives in China today; tomorrow the planet Mer(�ury, having
been advised of the arrivals and movements of ships by the astronomers of Asia,
will transmit the list to the astronomers of London,' and if we transpose this
prophecy into current vernacular so that it reads, 'When a ship arrives in China,
the T. S. F. will transmit the news to t.he Eiffel Tower or to London,? then it is clear,
I believe, that we have here an extraordinary anticipation. For what he means to
say is precisely this: the planet Mercury is there to represent a force, as yet un­
known, which would enahle the transmission of messages-a force of which he has
had a presentiment." Charles Gide, Fou.rier precurseur de la cooperation (Paris

Charles Gide on Fourier's nonsensical astrologi{�al speculations: "'He tells us that
the planets Juno, Ceres, and Pallas each produce a species of gooseherry, and that

lunacy is more amiable, bordering often on wisdom, abounding in fine and witty
observations, a bit like the harangues on the topic of the Golden Age that Don

On the theory of attraction: " Bernardin de Saint-Pierre denied the force of grav­
ity . . . because it signified an infringement on the free exercise of providence; and
the astronomer Laplace struggled . . . no less violently . . . against the fanciful
generalizations of this force. But that did not prevent the doctrines of an Azai's and
like-minded others . . . from finding their imitators. Henri de Saint-Simon . . . was
occupied for years with the elaboration of a system of 'universal gravitation,' and
in 1810 he came out with the following credo: 'I believe in God. I believe that God
created the universe. I believe that God made the universe subject to the law of
gravitation.' Fourier likewise founded . . . his . . . system on the 'force of universal
attraction,' of which sympathy between one man and another is said to be but a
special case." Ernst Robert Curtius, Balzac (Bonn, 1923), p. 45 (Azai's, 1766-

One readily grasps the importance of the culinary in Fourier; happiness has its
recipes like any pudding. It is realized on the basis of a precise measuring out of
different ingredients. It is an effect. Landscape, for example, signifies nothing to
Fourier. He has no feeling for its romantic aspect; the miserable huts of the
peasantry arouse his indignation. But let "composite agriculture" move into the
area, let the little "hordes" and the little "bands "2;1 spread out across it, let the
noisy military marches of the industrial army play over its surface, and we have
arrived at that proportion of elements needed for happiness to result.         [Wl l ,l]


The kinship between Fourier and Sade resides in the constmctive moment that is
proper to all sadism. Fourier conjoins the play of colors of the imagination in a
unique way with the play of numbers of his idiosyncrasy. It must be emphasized
that Fourier's harmonies are not dependent on any of the traditional number­
mysticisms, like that of Pythagoras or of Kepler. 1ney are altogether his concep­
tion, and they give to the harmony something inaccessible and protected: they
surround the hannoniens as though with barbed wire. The happiness of the
phalanstery is a bonheur barbele. On the other hand, I<ourierist traits can be
recognized in Sade. TIle experiences of the sadists, as presented in his 120 Jours
de Sod01ne, are, in their cmelty, exactly that extreme that is touched by the
extreme idyllic of Fourier. Les extremes se toue/zent. The sadist, in his experiments,
could chance on a partner who longs forjust those punishments and humiliations
which his tormentor inflicts. All at once, he could be standing in the midst of one
of those harmonies sought after by the Fourierist utopia.                      [W1 ! ,2J

" The sodal movement is the pattern for the three others. The animal, organic, and
material movements are coordinated with the social movement, which is primary.
This means that the properties of an animal, a vegetable, a mineral, or even a
vortex of' stars represent an effect of the human passions in the social order, and
that everything, from atoms to stars, is an image of the properties of the human
passions." Charles Fourier, Theorie des quatre mouvements (Paris, 184.1), p. 47.24

Very characteristic that Fourier waats much more to keep the father away from
the education of his children than the mother. "Disobedience toward the father

Fourier appears very suggestive before the background of the Empire in this
note: "The combined order will , from the outset, be as brilliant as it has been
long deferred. Greece, in the age of Solon and Pericles, was already in a position

organization." Armand and Maublanc, Fourier (Paris, 1937), vol. 1, pp. 261-262;

Work signal of the Little Hordes: "The charge of the Little Hordes is sounded in an

bulls. Then the Hordes, led by their Khans and Druids, rush forward with a great
shout, passing hefore the priests, who sprinkle them with holy water. . . . The

"'The individual . . . is a being essentially false, for neither by himself' alone nor

After 70,000 years comes the end of Harmony, in the form of a new period of
civilization, in descending tendency, which once more will give way to "obscure

"The "opera' stands at the forefront of educational directives . . . . The opera is a

horror of anything prejudicial to truth, preeision, and unity. At the opera, no
favor can exeuse the one whose note is false, whose timing, step, or gesture is off.
The prince's child who has a part in the dance or the choir must endure the truth,
must listen to the criticisms arising from the masses. It is at the opera that he
learns, in evcry move he makes, to subordinate himself to unitary proprieties, to
general accords ." Cited in .F. Armand and R. Mauhlanc, Fourier (Paris, 1937),

Fourier's texts are rich in stereotypical locutions comparable to the gradus ad
parnassum.,J() Almost every time he speaks of the arcades, it is to say that, under
present circumstances, even the king of France gets wet when he steps into his
carriage during a rainstorm.                                                    [W16,8]

Of the beauties of agriculture among the Harmoruans, Fourier gives an account
that reads like a description of color illustrations in children's books: "The socie­
tary state will be able to establish, down to the most unsavory functions, a
species-specific luxury. The gray overalls of a group of plowmen, the bluish
overalls of a group of mowers, will be enhanced by the borders, belts, and plumes
of their unifonn, by glossy wagons and inexpensively adorned harnesses, all
carefully arranged to protect the ornaments from the grime of work. If we should
see, in a pretty vale of the medleyed English sort, all these groups in action, well
sheltered by their colored tents, working in disseminated masses, circling about
with flags and instrnments, singing hynms in chorus while marching; and should
the region be sprinkled with manor houses and belvederes enlivened by colon­
nades and spires, instead of with thatched cottages, we would verily believe that
the landscape was enchanted, that it was a fairyland, an Olympian abode;' Even
the rape cutters, who lack high standing with Fourier, have a part in the splendor,
and are found "at work in the hills, raising their pavilions above thirty belvederes
crowned with golden rape;' Cited in Annand and Maublanc, Foun'er (Paris,
1937), vol. 2, pp. 203, 204.                                                 [WI6a,l]


Forming a mesh-for example, between herding, plowing, and gardening: " It is
not necessary that this interchange he total-say, that all of the twenty men en­
gaged in tending flocks from 5:00 to 6:30 go off as a group to work in the fields from
6:30 to 8:00. All that is necessary is for each series to provide the others with
several members takcn from its differcnt. groups. The cxchange of a few members
will suffice to establish a linkage or meshing between the different series."' Cited in
Armand and Mauhlanc, Pourier (Paris, 1937), vol. 2, pp. 160-161 (,'Essor de la
I.papillonncm).'11                                                            [W16a,2]

It is not just the despotism but also the moralism dmt Fourier hates in the great
Revolution. He presents the subde division of labor among Harmoniam as the
antidlesis of egalili, and their keen competition as an alternative to}i-aternili.
[WI6a,3]

In Le Nouveau Monde industriel (pp. 281-282), Fourier's rancor against Pestalozzi
is very evident. He says he took up Pestalozzi's "intuitive method" in his Traite
<de i 'association domestique-agricoie> of 1822 because of the great success it had had
with the public. Lacking such popular success, it would have created an unfavor­
able impression on its readers.-OfYverdon he recounts, at best, tales of scandal
calculated to prove d,at institutions of hamlony cannot be introduced with inlpu­
nity into civilization.                                                        [WI7, 1]

in conjunction with the amelioration of popular speech habits and of the musical
education of the people (worker-choirs of the theater of Toulouse!), Fourier treats
of measures to he taken against noise, He wants the workshops isolatcd and, for
the most part, transferred to the suburbs.                                 (W17,2]

Town-Planning: '"A man who wishes to have a hrilliant drawing room is keenly

and an antechamber provided with old and uncouth furnishings? , , . Why is it,
then, that the good taste evinced by each individual in the decOl'ation of his private
abode is not met with, as well, in our architects responsihle for those collcctivc

many other prescriptions for urhan planning, Fourier imagines some that would
allow one to recognizc, from the increasing or decreasing decoration on the huild­

Barharian, civilized, and harmonian town planning: " A harharian town is formed

arc the cities of France . . . . Civilized towns have a monotonous, imperfeet order,

carefully tests the people it shelters, allows the good their freedom, and detains thc
had for compulsory lahor. To what extent t.he artist was gripped by the reformist
ideas of those days ean be seen in the peculiar project of the 'oikema.' Already
quite eccentric in its outward aspect, this elongated building with its Greco-Roman
vestibule and windowless walls was to be the place where a new sexual ethic was
pioneered. To reach the goal of higher sexual morality, the spectacle of human
dissipation in the oikema, in the house of uninhibited passions, was supposed to
lead to the path of virtue and to 'Hymen's altar.' Later, the architect decided that
it would be better . . . to grant nature its rights . . . . A new, more liberated form of
marriage was to be instituted in the oikema, which the architect wanted to situate
in the most beautiful of landscapes." Emil Kaufmann, Von Ledoux bis Le Co,.­

'''The conclusion Marx draws for the capitalist economy: with the purchasing
power given him in the form of salary, the worker can purchase only a certain
amount of goods, whose production required just a fraction of the lahor he himself
has provided. In other words, if the merehandise he produees is to be sold by his
employer at a profit, he must always he expending surplus lahor. "" Henryk Gross­

A derivation of class hatred that draws on Hegel: ��The annulling of objectivity in
the form of estrangement (which has to advance from indifferent foreignness to

of the ohject but rather its ohjective character that is offensive and constitutes

Communism "in its first form." "Communism is . . . , in its first form, only a gener­

For it, the sole purpose of life and existence is direct, physical possession . The task
of the laborer is not done away with, but extended to all men. It wants to do away
by force with talent, and so forth . . . . It may be said that this idea of the commu­
nity ofwomen gives away the secret of this as yet completely crude and thoughtless
communism. Just as woman passes from marriage to general prostitution, so the
ent.ire world of wealth . . . passes from t.he relationship of exclusive marriage with
the owner of private property to a state of universal prostitution with the commu­

It would be an error to deduce the psychology of the bourgeoisie from the
attitude of the consumer. It is only the class of snobs that represents the stand­
point of the consmner. The foundations for a psychology of the bourgeois class
are much sooner to be found in the following sentence from Marx, which makes
it possible, in particular, to describe the influence which this class exerts, as model
and as customer, on art: "A certain stage of capitalist production dictates that the
capitalist be able to devote the whole of the time during which he functions as a
capitalist-that is, as personified capital-to the appropriation and therefore con­
trol of the labor of others, and to the selling of the products of tllls labor." Karl

can happen only with production of a very specific kind: capitalist production."

" This race of peculiar commodity-owners," as Marx at one point calls the prole­
tariat (Kapital <vol. 1 > , ed. Korsch, p. 173). Compare: " Natural instinct of the
commodity-owners" (ihid. , p. 97).111                                        [X3,5]

Marx opposes the idea that gold and silver are only imaginary values. "The fact
that money can, in certain functions, be replaced by mere symbols of itself gave
rise to that other mistaken notion: that it is itself a mere symbol. Nevertheless,
under this error lurked a presentiment that the money-form of an object is not an
inseparable part of that object hut. is simply t.he form lmder which certain social
relations manifest themselves. In this sense, every commodity is a symhol, since,
insofar as it is value, it is only t.he material envelope of the human labor spent upon
it. But if it he declared that . . . the material forms assumed hy the social qualities
of lahor under the regime of a definite mode of production are mere symbols, it is
in the same breath also declared that these characteristics are arhitrary fictions
sanctioned by the so-called universal consent of mankind. ?? Note after ';�spent upon
it": " "If we consider the concept of value � we must look on the thing itself as only a
symbol; it counts not as itself but as what it is worth' (Hegel � Rechtsphilosophie,

Private property as origin of the alienation of human beings from one another:
" Objects in themselves are external to man, and consequently alienable by him. In
order that tms alienation may be reciprocal, it is only necessary for men, by a tacit
understanding, to treat one another as private owners of those alienable objects,
and by implication as independent individuals . But such a stHte of' reciprocal
independence has no existence in a primitive society based on property in com­
mon . . . . The exchange of' commodities � therefore � first begins on the boundaries
of such communities." Karl Marx, Das Kapital <vol. 1 > , eel. Korsch (Berlin,
1932), p . 99 ("Del' Austauschprozell").2('                                   [X3a,1]

"In order that . . . objects may enter into relation with one another as commodi­
ties, their guardians must place themselves in relation to one another, as persons
whose will resides in those objects. �' Marx, Das Kapital <vol. 1 > , ed. Korsch

Marx recognizes a climax in the development, and in the transparency, of the
fetish character of the commodity: " The mode of production in which the product
takes the form of a commodity, or is produced directly for exchange, is the most
general and most embryonic form of bourgeois production. It therefore makes its
appearance at an early date in history, though not in the same predominating and
characteristic manner as nowadays. Hence, its fetish character is relatively easily
seen through. But when we come to more concrete forms, even this appearance of
simplicity vanishes." Marx, Das Kapital <vol. 1 > , ed. Korsch (Berlin, 1932), p. 94

The model according to which the polytechnical education demanded by Marx­
ism must orient itself: "There are . . . states of society in which one and the same
man does tailoring and weaving alternately, in which case these two forms of
labor are mere modifications of the labor of the same individual, and not special
and fixed functions of different persons" (Marx, Kapital, p. 57). These various
modified acts of labor on the part of one individual are not compared with one
another quantitatively, in temlS of duration; to the abstraction "mere labor,"
which we can educe from them, corresponds nothing real; they stand within a
unique concrete labor-context, the results of which bring no advantage to the
owner of commodities. Compare the following: "For a society based upon the
production of commodities, in which the producers in general enter into social
relations with one another by treating their products as commodities . . . ,
whereby they reduce their individual private labor to the standard of homogene­
ous human labor-for such a society, Christianity with its cuitUJ of abstract man
·   . . is the most fitting form of religion:' Marx, Kapital, p. 91 ("Fetischcharak­
ter")."                                                                         [X3a,4]

"111e body of the commodity, which serves as the equivalent, figures as the
materializatiou of human labor in the abstract, and is at the same time the
product of some specifically useful concrete labor.This concrete labor becomes,
therefore, the medium for expressing abstract human labor:' In this latter is
contained, as Marx believes, all the misery of the commodity-producing society.
\The passage is from Kapital, p. 7 0 ["Die Wertform oder del' Tauschwert"] .)'" In
addition, it is very inlportant that Marx in1mediately after this (p. 71) refers to
abstract human labor as the "opposite" of the concrete . -To formulate differ­
ently the misery at issue here, one could also say: it is the misery of the commod­
ity-producing society that, for it, "labor directly social in character" (p. 71) is
always merely abstract labor. If Marx, in his treatment of the equivalent form,
lays weight on the fact "that the labor of private individuals takes the form of its
opposite, labor directly social in form" (p. 71), then this private labor is precisely
the abstract labor of the abstract commodity-owning man.                         [X4,1]

Marx has the idea that labor would be accomplished voluntarily (as travail
passionnel if the commodity character of its production were abolished. The
reason, according to Marx, that labor is not accomplished voluntarily would
therefore be: its abstract character.                                            [X4,2]

" Value . . . converts every product into a social hieroglyphic. Later OIl, men try to
decipher the hieroglyphic, to get behind the secret of their own social products; for
the definition of the object of utility as value is just as much their social product as
language." Marx, Das Kapita1 <vol. I > ? p. 86 (,'Der Fetischcharakter del' Ware
und sein Geheimnis"),25                                                           [X4,3]

"The general value-form, which represents all products of labor as mere congela­
tions of undifferentiated human labor, shows by its very structure that it is the
social expression of the commodity world.Thus, it reveals that within this world
the generally human [that is, the inlpoverished and abstract] character of the
labor constitutes at the same time its distinguishing feature as social labor:' Marx,
Das Kapital <vol. 1>, p. 79 ("Die Wertform oder del' Tauschwert")."-The ab­
stract nature of the social labor and the abstract nature of tlle human being who
relates to fellow humans as an owner correspond to each other.                   [X4,4]

" How are we to express the fact that weaving creates the value of the linen not by
virtue of being weaving, as such, but by reason of its general property of being
human labor? Simply by opposing to weaving that other particular form of con­
crete labor (in this instance tailoring), which produces the equivalent of the prod­
uct of weaving. .Just as the coat in its bodily form became a direct expression of
value � so now does tailoring, a concrete form of labor, appear as the direct and
palpable embodiment of human labor generally" (Kapital <vol. 1 > , p. 71).27 This
is what Marx is referring to when he writes in the sentence preceding this passage:
�
"In the value-expression of the commodity, the tables are turned. ?? At this point a
note: " This inversion, whereby the sensuous-concrete counts only as a phenome­
nal form of the abstract-general-rather than the abstract-general as a property
of the concrete-is characteristic of the expression of value . . . . If I say: Roman
law and German law are both systems of' law, my statement is perfectly self-evi­
dent. But if I say: the law, that abstract concept, realizes itselfin Roman law and
in German law, those concrete legal systems, my context becomes mystical" (p. 71)

""When I state that coats or boots stand in a relation to linen because linen is the
universal incarnation of abstract human labor, the absurdity of the proposition is
manifest. Nevertheless, when the producers of coats and boots compare those
articles with linen, or, what is the same thing, with gold or silver, as the universal
equivalent, they express the relation between their own private labor and the
collective labor of society in precisely this absurd form." Karl Marx, Das Kapital,

" Political economy has . . . never . . . asked the question why labor is represented

formulas, which hear it stamped upon them in unmistakable letters that they

man, instead of being controlled by him-such formulas appear to the bourgeois
intellect to be as much a self-evident necessity imposed by nature as productive
labor itself." Marx, Das Kapital <vol. 1 > , ed. Korsch, p. 92-93 ("Del'

An extremely important passage relating to the concept of the "creative" is
Marx's comment on the beginning of the first paragraph of the Gotha Program,
"Labor is the source of all wealth and all culture": "The bourgeois have very
good grounds for falsely ascribing supernatural creative power to labor, since pre­
cisely from the fact that labor depends on nature, it follows that the man who
possesses no other property than his labor power must, in all conditions of
society and culture, be the slave of other men who have made themselves owners
of the material conditions of labo":' Karl Marx, Randglossen zum Programm der

"'Within the cooperative society based on common ownership of' the means of
production, the producers do not exchange their products; just as little does the
labor employed on the products appear here at the 'value of these products, as a
material quality possessed by them � since now, in contrast to capitalist society,
individual labor exists no longer in an indirect fashion, hut directly as a compo­
nent part of the total labor. The phrase 'proceeds of labor' . . . thus loses all
meaning." The passage refers to the demand for "a fair distribution of the pro-
ceeds of labor." Marx, Randglossen zum Progrmmn del' deutschen Arbeiterpartei

Korsch directs attention to a "scientific insight that is fundamental to the overall
understanding of Marxist communism, though today it is often looked upon by the
adversaries of Marxism, and even by many of its proponents, as 'meaningless'­
the insight, namely, that the wages of labor are not, as bourgeois economists like to
think, the value (or price) of the labor, but I. only a masked form of the value (or
price) of the labor power, which is sold as a commodity on the labor market well
before its productive utility (as labor) begins in the operation of the capitalist
proprietor." Karl Korsch, Introduction to Marx, Randglossen zum Pr'ogramm

"In the course of the labor process, labor passes continually out of a state of unrest
into a state of being, out of the form of motion into the form of objectivity. At the
end of one hour's spinning, that act is represented by a definite quantity of yarn;
in other words, a definite quantity of labor, namely that of one hour, has been
objectified in the cotton. We say I.labor' because the work of spinning counts here
only insofar as it is the expenditure oflabor power in general, and not insofar as it
is the specific work of the spinner. . . . Raw material and product appear here [in
the production of surplus value] in quite a new light, very different from that in
which we viewed them in the labor process pure and simple. The raw material
serves now merely as an absorbent of a definite quantity of labor. . . . Definite
quantities of product ? these quantities being determined by experience, now rep­
resent nothing but definite quantities of labor, definite masses of crystallizecl labor

The petty-bourgeois-idealist theory oflabor is given an unsurpassed fornmlation
in Sinunel, for whom it figures as the theory of labor per se. And with this, the
moralistic element-here in antimaterialist form-is registered very dearly.
"One filay . . . assert in very general temlS that . . . the distinction between filental
and manual labor is not one between mental and material nature; that, rather, the
reward is ultimately required in the latter case only for the internal aspect of
work, for the aversion to exertion, for the conscription of will power. Of course,
this intellectuality, which is, as it were, the thing-in-itselfbehind the appearance of
work . . . , is not really intellectual but resides in emotion and the will. It follows
from this that it is not coordinated with mental labor but rather is its basis. For at
first the objective content . . . , the result . . . , the demand for reward is produced
not in it but in . . . the expenditure ofenergy that it requires for the production of
this intellectual content. In that an act of the soul is revealed to be the source of
value . . . , physical and 'mental' labor contain a conunon (one might say, mor­
ally) value-grounding base, through which the reduction oflabor value as such to
physical labor loses its philistine and brutal materialistic appearance. This is
roughly the case with theoretical materialism, which acquires a completely new
and more seriously discussible basis if one emphasizes that matter itself is also a
conception, not an essence which, . . . in the absolute sense, stands opposed to the
soul but which in its cogrrizability is completely detemrined by the forms and
presuppositions oLour intellectual organization?' Of course, with these reflec­
tions « Philosophie des Geldes (Leipzig, 1900),> pp. 449-450), Sinunel is playing
devil's advocate, for he does not want to admit the reduction of labor to physical
labor. Indeed there is also, according to hinl, a valueless labor that still requires
an expenditure of energy. "Tills means, however, that the value of labor is
measured not by its amount but by the utility of its result!" Sinunel goes on to
reproach Marx, as it appears, for confusing a statement of fact with a demand.
He writes: "socialism, in fact, strives for a . . . society in which the utility value of
objects, in relation to the labor time applied to them, forms a constant" « ibid.,>
p. 451). "In the third volume of Capital, Marx argues that the precondition of all
value, of the labor theory too, is use value. Yet this means that so many parts of
the total social labor time are used in each product as come in relation to its
importance in use. . . . The approximation to this completely utopian state of
affairs seems to be technically possible only if, as a whole, nothing but the . . .
unquestionably basic life necessities are produced. For where this is exclusively
the case, one work activity is of course precisely as necessary and useful as the
next. In contrast, however, as long as one moves into the higher spheres in which,
on the one hand, need and estimation of utility are inevitably more individual
and, on the other, the intensity oflabor is more difficult to prove, no regulation of
the amounts of production could bring about a situation in which the relation­
ship between need and labor applied was everywhere the same. On these points,
all the threads of the deliberations on socialism intertwine. At this point, it is clear
that the . . . difficulty . . . increases in relation to the cultural level of the prod­
uct-a difficulty whose avoidance, of course, must limit production to that of the
nlost primitive, most essential, and most average objects!' Georg Sirnmel, PhiIOJO­
phie des Geldes (Leipzig, 1 9 00), pp. 451-453." With this critique, compare the
counter-critique of this standpoint by Korsch, X9,I.                            [X6;X6a]

" The individual significance of different objects of equal value is degraded
through their exchangeability-however indirectly or imaginary this may be . . . .
The disparagement of the interest in the individuality of a commodity leads to a
disparagement of individuality itself. If the two sides to a commodity arc its quality
and its price, then it seems logically impossible for the interest to be focused on
only one of these sides; for 'cheapness' is an empty word if it does not imply a low
price for a relatively good quality. . . . Yet this conceptual impossibility is psycho­
logically real and effective. The interest in the one side can be so great that its
logically necessary counterpart completely disappears. The typical instance of one
of these cases is the 'fifty-cent bazaar.' The principle of valuation in the modern
money economy finds its clearest expression here. It is not the commodity that is
the center of interest here but. the price-a principle that in former times not only
would have appeared shameless but would have been absolutely impossible. It has
heen rightly pointed out that the medieval town . . . lacked t.he extensive capital
economy, and that this was the reason for seeking the ideal of the economy, not so
much in the expansion (which is possihle only through cheapness) as in the quality
of t.he goods offered." Georg Simmel, Philosophie des Geldes (Leipzig, 1900),

threshold we are faced with the inscription: 'No admittance except on busi,

" What Marx . . . terms the 'fetishism of the world of commodities' is only a scien­
tific expression for the same thing that he had described earlier . . . as 'human
self-alienation.' . . . The most important substantive difference between this philo­
sophical critique of economic 'self-alienat.ion " and the later scientific exposition of
the same problem consists in the fact t.hat, in Das Kapital, Marx . . . gave his
economic critique a deeper and more general significance by tracing back the
delusive charact.er of all other economic categories to the fetish charact.er of t.he
commodity. Though even now that most obvious and direct form of the 'self-al­
ienation of the human being,' which occurs in the relation hetween wage labor and
capital, keeps its decisive importance for the practical attack on the existing order
of society, the fet.ishism of commodity labor power is, at. this stage, for theoretical
purposes regarded as a mere derivative form of the more general fetishism which is
contained in the commodity itself . . . . B y revealing all economic categories to be
mere fragments of one great fetish, Marx ultimately transcended all preceding
forms and phases of bourgeois economic and social theory. . . . Even the most
advanced classical economists remained caught in the . . . world of bourgeois ap­
pearance, or fell back into it, because t.hey had never succeeded in extending their
crit.ical analysis either to the derived forms of economic fetishism [unmasking of
the gold and silver fetishes , the physiocratic illusion that rent grows out of the
earth, the interpretation of interest and rent as mere fractions of' industrial profit]
or to that general fundamental form which appears in the value-form of' the labor
products as commodity and in the value-relations of the commodities themselves."

""From the bourgeois point of view, the individual citizen thinks of 'economic'
things and forces as of something entering into his private life from without. . . .
According to the new conception, however, individuals in all they do are moving,
from the outset, within definite social circumstances that arise from a given stage
in the development of material production. . . . Such high ideals of bourgeois
society as that of the free, self-determining individual, freedom and equality of all
citizens in the exercise of their political rights, and equality of all in the eyes of the
law are now seen to be nothing but correlative concepts to the fetishism of the
commodity. . . . Only by keeping the people unconscious of the real contents of
those basic relations of the existing social order . . . , only through the fetishistic
transformation of the social relations between the class of capitalists and the class
of wage laborers, resulting in the 'free and unhampered' sale of the "commodity
labor-power' to the owner of "capital,' is it possible in this society to speak of
freedom and equality." Korsch, Karl Marx, <vol. 2,> P l' . 75-77 ,'>,             (X8a,!]

individual labor-powers for a certain time to a capitalist entrepreneur are, as a
class, from the outset and forever, a common property of the possessing class,
which alone has the real means of labor at its disposal. It was therefore not the
whole truth that was revealed by Marx in the Communist Manifesto when he said
that the bourgeoisie had . . . replaced the veiled forms of exploitation practiced
during the . . . Middle Ages by an altogether 'unveiled exploitation. ? The bourgeoi­
sie replaced an exploitation embroidered with religious and political illusions by a
new and more refined system of concealed exploitation. Whereas in earlier epochs
the openly proclaimed relations of domination and servitude appeared as the
immediate springs of production, in the bourgeois period it is . . . , conversely,

On the doctrine of value: "The idea that there is an 'equality' inherent in all kinds
of labor, by which economists are entitled to regard qualitatively different kinds
of labor . . . as quantitatively different portions of a total quantity of 'general
labor,' which fonns the basis of the economic concept of value, is so little the
discovery of a natural condition underlying the production and excbange of
commodities that this 'equality' is, on the contrary, brought into existence by the
social fact that, under the conditions prevailing in present-day capitalist 'com­
modity production,' all labor products are produced as commodities for such
exchange. In fact, this 'equality' appears nowhere else than in the 'value' of the
commodities so produced. The full development of the economic theory of 'labor
value' coincided with a stage of the lristorical development when human lab01;
not just as a category but in reality, had long ceased to be, as it were, organically
connected with either the individual or with small productive communities and,
the barriers of the guilds having fallen under the new bourgeois banner of 'free­
dom of trade; every particular kind of labor was treated henceforth as equivalent
to every other particular kind of labor. It was precisely the advent of these
lristorical and political conditions that was expressed (unconsciously, of course)
by the classical economists when they traced back the 'value' appearing in the
exchange of commodities to the quantities of labor incorporated therein, though
most of them believed they had thus disclosed a natural law. . . . Those minor
followers in the wake of the great scientific founders of political economy, no
longer accustomed to such audacity of scientific thought, who have later patheti­
cally bewailed the 'violent abstraction' by wlrich the classical economists and
Marxism, in tracing the value relations of commodities to the amounts of labor
incorporated therein, have 'equaled the unequal; must be reminded of the fact
that this 'violent abstraction' results not from . . . economic science but from the
real character of capitalist commodity production. The commodity is a born leveler."
Korsch, Karl Marx, vol. 2, pp. 66-68. In "reality;' of course, the "particular kinds
of labor performed in the production of the various useful things are, according
to Marx, effectively different also under the regime of the law of value" (ibid.,
p. 68)." This in opposition to Simmel; compare X6a.                                 [Xg]


" Marx and Engels . . . pointed out that the equality-idea resulting from the epoch
of bourgeois commodity-production and expressed in the economic 'law of value'
is still bourgeois in its character. It is therefore only ideologically incompatible
with the exploitation of the working class through capital, but not in actual prac­
tice. The socialist Ricardians, . . . on the basis of the economic principle that 'it is
labor alone which bestows value,' . . . wanted to transform all men into actual
workers exchan6ring equal quantities of labor. . . . Marx replied that 'this equali­
tarian relation . . . is itself nothing hut the reilection of the actual world; and that
therefore it is totally impossible to reconstitute society on the basis of what is
merely an embellished shadow of it. In proportion as this shadow takes on sub­
stance again, we perceive that this substance, far from being the transfigurat.ion
dreamt of, is the actual hody of existing society. m The citation from I..Ia Misere de

Korsch: In the bourgeois epoch, " the production of the products oflahor is pretext
and cover for the . . . exploitation and oppression of the laborers. The scientific
method of concealing this state of affairs is called political economy." Its function:
to shift " responsibility for all the wast.e and hideousness which is already found at
the present stage of development of the productive forces of society, and which
emerges catastrophically during economic crises, from the realm of human action
to the sphere of so-called immutable, nature-ordained relations between things."

"'The distinction between use value and exchange value, in the abstract form in
which it had been made by the bourgeois economists, . . . did not provide any
useful starting point for an . . . investigation of bourgeois commodity produc­
tion . . . . With Marx, . . . use value is not defined as a use value in general, but as
the use value of a commodity. This use value inherent in commodities . . . is,
however, not merely an extra-economic presupposition of their "value. ' It is an
element of the value . . . . The mere fact that a thing has utility for any human
being-say, for its producer-does not yet give us the economic definition of use
value. Not until the thing has . . . utility "for other persons' . . . does the economic
definition of use value apply. Just as the use value of the commodity is economi-
cally defined as a social use value (use value "for others '), so is the . . . labor which
goes into the production of this commodity defined economically as . . . labor "for
others.' Thus, Marx's commodity-producing labor appears as social labor in a
twofold sense. It has . . . the general social character of being a "specifically useful
labor,' which goes to the production of a definite kind of social use value. It has, on
the other hand, the specific historical character of being a "generally social labor, '
which goes to the production of a definite quantity of exchange value. The capacity
of social labor to produce definite things useful to human beings . . . appears in the
use ·value of its product. Its capacity for the production of a value and a surplus
value for the capitalist (a particular characteristic of labor which derives from the
particular form of the social organization of the labor process . . . within the
present historical epoch) appears in the exchange value of its product. The fusion
of the two social characteristics of commodity-producing labor appears in the
"value-form' of the product of labor, or the form of comntodity." Korsch, Karl
Marx <vol. 2 > , pp. 42-44.'19                                                       [XIO]

" The earlier hourgeois economists, when speaking of labor as a source of wealth,
had likewise thought of 'labor' in terms of the various forms of real work, though
they did so only for the reason that their economic categories were still in the
process of separation from their original material contents . . . . Thus, the Mercan­
tilists, the Physiocrats, and so on successfully declared that the true source of
wealth lies in the labor expended in the export industries, in trade and shipping, in
agricultural labor, and the like. Even in Adam Smith-who, from the different
branches of labor, definitely advanced to the general form of commodity-produc­
ing labor-we find that concrete aspect retained, along with the new and more
formalistic definition which is also expressed in his system and was later to become
the exelusive definition of value in the work of Ricardo, and by which labor is
defined as an abstract and merely quantitative entity. This same abstract form of
labor, which he correctly defined as exchange-value-producing lahor, he at the
same time . . . declared to he the only source . . . of the material wealth of the
community, or use value. This doctrine, which still obstinately persists in "vulgar l
socialism . . . is, according to Marx l economically false." By its assumptions, "'it
would he difficult to explain why, in present day . . . society, just those persons are
poor who hitherto have had that unique source of all wealth at their exclusive
disposal, and even more difficult to account for the fact t.hat they remain unem­
ployed and poor, inst.ead of producing wealth hy t.heir labor. . . . But . . . in prais­
ing the creative power of' 'labor,' Adam Smith was thinking not so much of the
forced lahor of the modern wage laborer, which appears in the value of commodi­
ties and produces capitalistic profit, as of the general natural necessit.y of human
labor. . . . Likewise, his naive glorificat.ion of the 'division of labor' achieved in
t.hese 'great manufactures,' hy which he understood the whole of modern capital­
ist production, refers not so much to the extremely imperfect form of contempo­
rary capitalistic division of' labor . . . as to the general form of human labor
vaguely fused with it. in his theoretical exposition." Korsch, Karl Marx, vol. 2,
pp. 44--46. 5()                                                                  [X10a]

Decisive passage on surplus value, the final statement no doubt standing in need
of further clarification: "Similarly, the doctrine 0/ surplus value, which is usually
regarded as the more particularly socialist section of Marx's economic theory, is
neither a simple economic exercise in calculation which serves to check a fraudu­
lent statement of value received and expended by capital in its dealing with the
workers, nor a moral lesson drawn from economics for the purpose of reclainling
from capital the diverted portion of the 'full product of the worker's labor; The
Marxian doctrine, as an econollnc theory, starts rather from the opposite princi­
ple-that the industrial capitalist under 'normal' conditions acquires the labor­
power of the wage laborers by means of a respectable and businesslike bargain,
whereby the laborer receives the full equivalent of the 'commodity' sold by him ,
that is, of the 'labor-power' incorporated in himself. The advantage gained by the
capitalist in this business derives not from economics but from his privileged
social positioll as the lllonopolist owner of the material l11eans of production,
which permits him to exploit, for the production of commodities in his work­
shop, the specific use value of a labor-power which he has purchased at its eco­
nomic 'value' (exchange value) . Between the value a/the new commodities produced
by the use o/the labor-power in the workshop, and the prices paidfir this labor to its
sellers) there is) according to Marx) no economic or other rationally determinable relation
whatever. The measure of value produced by the workers in the shape of their
labor products over and above the equivalent of their wages (that is, the mass 0/
'surplus labor' expended by them in producing this 'surplus value') and the quan­
titative relation between this surplus labor and the necessary labor (that is, the
'rate o/sUJplus value' or the 'rate a/exploitation' holding good for a particular time
and a particular country) do not result from any exact economic calculation.
They result from a battle between social classes;' Korsch, Karl Marx, vol. 2,
pp. 71-72.51                                                                        [Xl!]

Sources for Marx and Engels: ""From the bourgeois historians of the French Resto­
ration, they took the concept of soeial class and of class struggle; from Ricardo,
the economic basis of the class antagonism; from Proudhon, the proclamation of
the model'll proletariat as the only real revolutionary class; from the feudal and
Christian assHilants of the new economic order . . . , the ruthless unmasking of the
liberal ideas of the bourgeoisie, the piercing hate-ftlled invective. Their ingenious
dissection of the unsolvahle contradictions of the modern mode of production they
took from the petty-bourgeois soeialism of Sismondi; the humanism and the phi­
losophy of action, from earlier companions among the left Hegelians, especially
from Feuerbach; the meaning of political struggle for the working class, from the
contemporary labor parties, French Social Democrats and English Chartists; the
doctrinc of revolutionary dictatorship, from the French Convention, and from
Blanqui and his followers. Finally, they took from Saint-Simon, Fourier, and
Owen the entire content of their socialist and communist agenda: the total up­
heaval of the foundations of existing capitalist society, the aholition of classes . . . ,
and the transformation of the state into a merc administration of production. "

"Through Hegel, the new materialism of proletarian theory linked itself to the sum
of hourgeois social thought of the preceding historical period. It did so in the same
antithetical form in which, on a practical level also, the social action of the prole­
tariat (jontinued the previous social movement of the bourgeois class." Korsch,

Korsch says very justly (and one might well tlunk of de Maistre and Bonald in
this connection): "To a certain extent, that . . . 'disenchantment' which, after the
conclusion of the great French Revolution, was first proclaimed hy the early
French theorists of the counterrevolution and by tile German Romantics . . . has
in fact exerted a considerable influence upon Marx mainly through Hegel, and
has thus directly entered into the . . . theory of the modern workers' movement:'
Korsch, Karl Marx, vol. 2, p. 36.5,;                                           [X12,3]

Concept of productive force: !.((Productive foree' is, in the first place, nothing else
than the real earthly lahor-power of living men: the force . . . by which . . . they
produce . . . , under capitalistic conditions, 'commodities .' . . . Everything t.hat
increases the productive effect of human lahor-power . . . is a new social 'produc­
tive force. ' To the material forces of production belong nature, technology, and
science; hut to these forees helong, above all, the social organization itself and the
. . . social forces created therein by cooperation and the industrial division of
lahor. �' Korsch, Karl Marx, vol. 3, pp. 54-55. ;(,
;                             [X12a,1]

Concept of productive force: ·'The Marxian concept. of 'social' productive forces
has nothing in common with the idealistic ahstractions of' the old and new "techno­
crats,' who imagine they can define and measure the productive powers of society
. . . in terms of natural science and technology. . . . 'Technocratic' prescriptions
are not sufftcient in themselves to remove the material ohst. acles whith oppose any
important change in present-day capitalistic society. . . . There is more power of
resistance in the mute force of economic conditions . . . than well-meaning techno-
crats have ever dreamt of." Korsch, Karl lJllal'x, vol. 3 , pp. 59-60.57    [X12a,2]

In Marx-"Das philosophische Manifest del' historischen Rechtsschule," Rhein­
ische Zeitung, 221 (1842)-therc appears, as a point of l'(�ference, " the correct
idea . . . that the primitive conditions are naive 'Dutch pictures' of the true condi­
tions." Cited in Korseh, vol. I , p. 35. ;;11                                 [X12a,3]

Against Proudhon, who looks on maclune and division of labor as antithetical to
each other, Marx emphasizes how much the division of labor has been refined
since the introduction of machinery. Hegel, for his part, emphasized that the
division of labor, in a certain sense, opened the way for the introduction of
maclllnery. "This parceling out of tlleir content . . . gives rise to the division of
labor. . . . The labor which thus becomes more abstract tends, on one hand, by its
uniformity, to make labor easier and to increase production; on another, to limit
each person to a single kind of technical skill, and thus produce more uncondi­
tional dependence on the social system. The skill itself becomes in tlus way
meffianical, and becomes capable of letting tile machine take the place of hu­
man labor:' Hegel, En�vklopiidie der jJhilosoPhischen WiJsenschajien im GrundrisJe
(Leipzig, 1920), p. 436 (paragraphs 525-526) .'"                              [X12a, 4]

The critique carried Ollt hy the young Marx on the "rights of man,'� as separated
from the "rights of the citizen." "'None of the so-called rights of man goes heyond
egoistic man . . . . Far from the rights of man conceiving of man as a species-being,
species-life itself, society, appears as a framework exterior to individuals . . . . The
only bond that holds them together is natural necessity, need and private interest,
the conservation of their property and egoistic person. It is . . . paradoxical . . .
that citizenship, the political community, is degraded by the political emancipa­
tors to a mere means for the preservation of these so-called rights of man; that the
citizen is declared to be the servant of egoistic man; that the sphere in which man
behaves as a communal being is degraded below the sphere in which man behaves
as a partial being; finally that it is not man as a citizen but man as a bourgeois who
is called the real and true man . . . . The riddle has a simple solution . . . . What was
the character of the old society? . . . Feudalism. The old civil society had a directly
political character. . . . The political revolution . . . abolished the political charac­
ter of civil society. It shattered civil society . . . on the one hand into individuals,
on the other hand into the material and spiritual elements that make up the . . .
civil position of these individuals . . . . The formation of the political state and the
dissolution of civil society into independent individuals, who are related by law
just as the estate and corporation men were related by privilege, is completed in
one and the same act. Man as member of civil society, unpolitical man, appears
necessarily as natural man. The rights of man appear as natural rights, because
self-conscious activity is concentrated upon political action. Egoistic man is the
passive, given result of the dissolved society, . . . a natural object. Political revolu­
tion's . . . attitude to civil society, to the world of need, to work, private interests,
and private law, is that they are . . . its natural basis. Finally, man as a member of
civil society counts for true man, for man as distinct from the citizen, because he is
man in his sensuous . . . existence, while political man is only the abstract . . .
man . . . . The abstraction of the political man is thus correctly described hy Rous­
seau: "He who dares to undertake the making of a people's institutions ought to
feel himself' capable . . . of changing human nature, of transforming each individ­
ual, who is by himself' a complete and solitary whole, into part of a greater whole
from which he . . . receives his life and being' (Contrat social [London, 1782], voL
2, p. 67). ?? Marx, -�Zur Judenfrage," in 'Marx and Engels, Gesamtausgabe, vol. 1,
# Section 1 , 1 (Frankfurt Am Main, 1927), Pp. 595-599.'"                             [X13]

The property appertaining to the commodity as its fetish character attaches as
well to the commodity-producing society-not as it is in itself, to be sure, but
more as it represents itself and thinks to understand itself whenever it abstracts
from the fact that it produces precisely commodities. The image that it produces
of itself in this way, and that it customarily labels as its culture, corresponds to the
concept of phantasmagoria (compare "Eduard Fuchs, Collector and Historian,"
# Section 3)." The Latter Is Defined By Wiesengrund "As A Consumer Item In Which
there is no longer anything that is supposed to remind us how it came into being.
It becomes a magical object, insofar as the labor stored up in it comes to seem
supernatural and sacred at the very moment when it can no longer be recognized
as labor" (T W Adorno, "Fragmente tiber Wagner;' Zeitschrffl }iir Sozia/for­
schung, 8, nos. 1-2 [1939], p. 17). In connection with this, from the manuscript on
Wagner (pp. 46-47) : "1'be art of Wagner's orchestration has banished . . . the
role of the immediate production of sound from the aesthetic totality. . . . Anyone
fully able to grasp why Haydn doubles the violins with a flute in piano might well
get an intuitive glimpse into why, thousands of years ago, men gave up eating
uncooked grain and began to bake bread, or why they started to smooth and
polish their tools. All trace of its own production should ideally disappear from
the object of consumption. It should look as though it had never been made, so as
not to reveal that the one who sells it did not in fact make it, bnt rather appropri­
ated to himself the labor that went into it. The autonomy of art has its origin in
the concealment of labor.""                                                   [XI3a]

Industrialization in literature. On Scribe. ""Although he made fUll ofthe big indus­

hi,s cagle eye that, in the last analysis, all wealth rests on the art 0 f getting others to
work for Uf). SO then, groul1dhreaking genius that he was, he transferred the
principle of the division of lahor from the workshops of tailors, cahinetmakers,
and manufacturers of pen nibs to the ateliers of dramati(� artists, who, before this
reform, working with only their one head and one pen, had earned merely the
�
proletarian wages of the isolated worker. An entire generation of theatrical gen-
iuses were in his debt for their training and development, their awards, and, not
infrequently, even their riches and reputation. Scribe chose the subject, sketched
out the main lines of the plot, indicated the places for special effects and brilliant
exits, and his apprentices would compose the appropriate dialogue or verses. Once
they had made some progress, their name would appear on the title page (next to
that of the firm) as a just recompense, until the best would break away and begin
turning out dramatical works of their own invention, perhaps also in their turn
recruiting new assistants. By these means, and under the protection afforded by

who made the famous expert report in favor of photography submitted, in that
same year (?), 1838, an unfavorable report on the railroad constlUction planned
by the government: "In 1838, when the government sent them the bill autho·
rizing construction of railroad lines from Paris to Belgium, to Ie Havre, and to
Bordeaux, the parliamentary reporter Arago reconnnended rejection, and his
reconnnendation was approved by a vote of 160 to 90. Among other arguments,
it was claimed that the difference in temperature at the entrance and exit of the
tunnels would bring on mortal chills and fevers." Dubech and d'Espezel, Histaire
de Pa.ris (paris, 1926), p. 386.                                          [Yla,5]

From Nadar's splendid description of his photographic work in the Paris cata­
combs: "With each new camera setup, we had to test our exposure time empiri­
cally; certain of the plates were found to require up to eighteen minutes.­
Remember, we were still, at that time, using collodion emulsion on glass nega­
tives . I had judgcd it advisahle to animate some of these scenes by the use of
.   .   .



a hUlnan figure-less from considerations of picturesqueness than in order to
give a sense of scale, a precaution too often neglected by explorers in this medium
and with sometimes disconcerting consequences. For these eighteen minutes of
exposure time, I found it difficult to obtain from a human being the absolute,
inorganic immobility I required. I tried to get round this difficulty by means of
mannequins, which I dressed in worknlan's clothes and positioned in the scene
with as little awkwardness as possible; this business did nothing to complicate
our task. . . . This nasty ordeal of photographing in the sewers and catacombs, it
must be said, lasted no less than three consecutive months . . . . Altogether, I
brought back a hundred negatives . . . . I made haste to offer the first hundred
prints to the collections of the City of Paris put together by the eminent engineer
of our subterranean constructions, M. Belgrand." Nadar, OEand .i'dais photo­

Nadar reproduces the Balzacian theory of the daguerreotype, which in turn
derives from the Democritean theory of the eidola. (Nadal' seems to be unac­
quainted with the latter; he never mentions it.) Gautier and Nerval would have
conformed to Balzac's opinion, "but even while speaking of specters, both of
them . . . were among the very first to pass before our lens;' Nadal; O.J:jandj'etais

The passage on photography from Lemerciel" s Lampelie et Dague,.,.e:
As, menaced by the hirdcatcher's pitiless nets,
The meadowlark, rousing the muses of morning,
Flutters and foolishly comes to alight on a
Lark-mirror, reef of its daltiances,
So Lampelie's (= sunlight's) flight is cut short
By the chemical snare of DaguetTe.
The face of a crystal, convex 01' concave,
Will reduce or enlarge every object it marks.
Its fine, lucid rays, through the depths of the trap,
Cat.ch the aspect of placcs in rapid inscription:
The image imprisoned within the glass plate,
Preserved from all threatening contact,
Retains its bright life; and certain reflections
Break through to the most. distant sphet·es.

"Photography . . . was first adopted within the dominant social class . . . : manu­
facturers, factory owners and bankers, statesmen, men of letters, and scientists."
Gisela Freund, "La Photographie au point de vue sociologique" (manuscript,
p. 32). Is this accurate? Shouldn't the sequence be reversed?                 [Y3,2]
Among the inventions that predate photography one should mention, in particu­
lar, the lithograph (invented in 1805 by A10is Senefelder and introduced into
France some years later by Philippe de Lasteyrie) and the physionotrace, which,
for its part, represents a mechanization of the process of cutting silhouettes.
"Gilles Louis Chretien, . . . in 1786, . . . successfully invented an apparatus which
. . . combined two different modes of making portraits : that of the silhouette and
that of the engraving. . . . The physionotrace was based on the well-known prin­
ciple of the pantograph. A system of parallelograms was articulated in such a way
as to be capable of transfer to a horizontal plane. With the aid of a dry stylus, the
operator traces the contours of a drawing. An inked stylus traces the lines of the
first stylus, and reproduces the drawing on a scale determined by the relative
position of the two styluses:' Gisela Freund, "La Photographie au point de vue
sociologique" (manuscript, pp. 1 9-20). The apparatus was equipped with a
viewfinder. Life-size reproductions could be obtained.                         [Y3,3]

11,e reproduction time with the physionotrace was one minute for normal sil­
houettes, three minutes for colored ones. It is characteristic that the begitmings of
the technologizing of the portrait, as instanced in this apparatus, set back the art
of the portrait qualitatively as much as photography later advanced it. "One can
see, on examining the quite enormous body of work produced with the
physionotrace, that the portraits all have the same expression: stiff, schematic,
and featureless . . . . Although the apparatus reproduced the contours of the face
with mathematical exactitude, this resemblance remained expressionless because
it had not been realized by an artist:' Gisela Freund, "La Photographie au point
de vue sociologique" (manuscript, p. 25). It would have to be shown here just
why this primitive apparatus, in contrast to the camera, excluded "artistry:'
[Y3a,1]

"In Marseilles, around 1850, there were at most four or five painters of' mini­
atures, of whom two, perhaps, had gained a certain reputation by executing fifty
portraits in the course of a year. These artists earned just enough to make a
living . . . . A few years later, there were forty to fifty photographers in Mar-
seilles . . . . They each produced, on the average, between 1,000 and 1,200 plates
per year, which they sold for 15 francs apiece; t.his made for yearly receipts of
18,000 francs, so that, together, they constituted an industry earning nearly a
�
million. And this same development can be seen in all the major cities of France. '

pp. 15-16), citing Vidal, Memoire de La seance du 1 5 novembre 1868 de La Societe

On the interlinking of technological inventions: (.�When he wanted to experiment
with lithography, Niepce, who lived in the country, ran into the greatest difficulties
in procuring the necessary stones. It was then that he got the idea of replacing the
stones with a metal plate and the crayon with sunlight." Gisela Freund, "La Pho-
tographie au point de vue sociologique�� (manuscript, p. 39), in reference to Victor
Fouque, Niepce: I.-a Verite sur l'invention de la photog,.apIH�e (Chfilons sur Saone,

Following Arago's report to the Chamher: " A few hours later� opticians' shops
were hesieged; there were not enough lenses, not enough camera ohscuras to sat­
isfy the zeal of so many eager amateurs. Thcy watched with regretful eye the
setting sun on the horizon, as it carried away the raw material of the exp{�riment.
But on thc morrow, during the first hours of the day, a great number of these
experimenters could he seen at their windows, striving, with all sorts of anxious
preealltions, to capture on a prepared plate the image of a dormer-window oppo­

Photography in the age of Disderi: "The characteristic accessories of a photo­
graphic studio in 1865 are the pillar, the curtall, and the pedestal table. Posed
there, leaning, seated, or standing np, is the subject to be photographed: full­
length, half-length, or bust. The background is filled, according to the social rank
of the model, with other paraphernalia, symbolic and picturesque." Further on
comes a very characteristic extract (without page reference) from L'Art de fa
f)hotogmjJhie (Paris, 1 862) , by Disderi, who says, among other things : "In making
a portrait, it is not a question only , . , of reproducing, with a n1athenlatical
accuracy, the f011ns and proportions of the individual; it is necessary also, and
above all, to grasp and represent, while justifying and embellishing, . . . the inten­
tions of nature toward this individual:' Gisela Freund, "La Photographie au
point de vue sociologique" (manuscript, pp. 106, 108).-The pillars : emblem of

Gisela Freund (manuscript, pp. 116-117) provides the follomng citation from Dis­
ded's L 'A rt de la photographie: " Could not the photographer who was a master of'
all the effects of lighting, who hall at his disposal a large and perfectly equipped
studio with hlinders and reflectors, who was pt'ovided with hackdrops of all kinds,
with settings, properties, costumes-could he not, given intelligent and skillfully
dressed models, compose tableaux d(� gem'e, historical scenes? Could he not aspire
to sentiment, like Scheffer, or to style, like Ingres? Could he not treat of history,
like Paul Del.roche in his painting The Death oithe Due de Guise?" At the world
exhibition of 1855, there were some photographs of this sort produced in England.
[Y4a,l]

The paintings of Delacroix escape the competition with photography, not only
because of the impact of their colors, but also (in those days, there was no instant
photography) because of the stormy agitation of their subject matter. And so a
benevolent interest in photography was possible for him.                     [Y4a,2]

VVhat makes the first photographs so incomparable is perhaps this: that they
present the earliest image of the encounter of machine and man.       [Y4a,3]

One of the-often unspoken-objections to photography: that it is impossible
for the human countenance to be apprehended by a machine. Tills the sentiment
ofDelacroix in particular.                                             [Y4a,4]

"Yvon, . . . pupil of Delaroche, . . . decided, one day, to reproduce the Battle of
Solferino . . . . Accompanied by the photographer Bisson, he goes to the Tuileries,
gets the emperor to strike the right sort of pose, has him turn his head, and bathes
everything in the light he wishes to reproduce. The painting that resulted in the
end was acclaimed under the title The Emperor in a Kepi." Following this, a
courtroom battle between the painter and Bisson, who had put his photo on the
market. He is convicted. Gisela Freund, ��La Photographie au point de vue soei­

There is a certain relation between the invention of photography and the inven­
tion of the mirror-stereoscope by Wheatstone in 1838. "It displays two different
images of the same object: to the right eye, an image representing the object in
perspective as it would be seen from the viewpoint of the right eye; to the left eye,
all image of the object as it would appear to the left eye. TIns gives rise to the

illusion that we have . . . before us a three-dimensional object" (Egon Friedel!,

l.'At the world exhibition of 1855, photography, despite its lively claims, could gain
no entry into the sanctuary of the hall on the Avenue Montaigne; it was condemned
to seek asylum in the immense bazaar of assorted products that Hlled the Palais de
PIndustrie. In 1859, under growing pressure, the museum committee . . . ac­
corded a place in the Palais de PIndustrie for the exhibition of photography; the
exhibition site was on a level with that made uvailahle to painting and engraving,
but it had a separate entrance and was set, so to speak, in a different key. " Louis
Figuier, La Photographie au Salon de 1859 (Paris, 1860), p. 2.                 [Y6a,2]

'"A skilliul photographer always has a distiIu�tive style, just like a draftsman or a
painter; . . . and, what's more, . . . the distinctive character of the artistic spirit of
each nation is clearly revealed . . . in the works produced in different coun-
tries . . . . A French photographer could never be confused . . . with one of his
colleagues from across the Channel. " Louis Figuier, La Photographie au Salon de
1859 (Paris, 1860), p. 5.                                                         [Y6a,3]

The beginnings of photomontage come out of the attempt to ensure that unages
of the landscape retain a painterly character. "M. Silvy has an excellent system
for producing his pictures. . . . Instead of linposing, on all his landscapes indiffer­
ently, one and the same sky fomled from a uniform negative, he takes the
trouble, wherever possible, of separately enhancing, one after tl,e otller, the view
of the landscape and that of the sky which crowns it. Here resides one of the
secrets of M. Silvy:' Louis Figuier, La Photographie au Salon de 1859 (Paris,
1860), p. 9.                                                                    [Y6a,4]

It is significant that Figuier's booklet on the Salou of Photography of 1859 begins
with a review of laudscape photography.                                      [Y6a,5]

Ai the Salon de Photographie of 1859, numerous "�voyages": to Egypt, to JCl'usa­

tical processes of photography on paper come to he understood than a whole hand
of operators rushed forth . . . in all directions, to hring us hack views of monu­

Among the works of reproduction to which Figuier gives special attention, in his
Photographie au Salon, are the reproduction of the Raphael cartoon from Hamp­

fourteenth century and kept, at that time, in the monastery of Mount Athos.

There were portraits specifically designed to be viewed through the stereoscope.
This fashion was current in England, above all.                            [Y7, 2]

Figuier (pp. 77-78) does not omit to mention the possibility that '"microscopic
photographs" could be used in time of war to transmit secret messages (in the form
of miniatul'e telegrams).                                                    [Y7, 3]

" One thing . . . made clear by a careful inspection of' the exhibition     . is the
present perfection . . . of the positive proof. Five or six years ago, photography
was almost exclusively concerned with the negative, . . . and it was rare indeed
that anyone gave thought to the utility of printing from a positive image." Louis
Figuier, La Photographic att Salon de 1859 (Paris, 1860), p. 83.               [Y7,4]

Symptom, it would seem, of a profound displacement: painting must submit to
being measured by the standard of photography: "We will be in agreement with
the public in admiring . . . the fine artist who . . . has appeared this year widl a
painting capable of holding its own, in point of delicacy, with daguerrian prints:'
This assessment of Meissonnier is from Auguste Galinlard, Examen du Salon de

" The first experiment t.o launch research into scientifically produced motion . . .
was that of Doctor Pares in 1825. The details arc well known: on one side of a small
square of cardhoard, he had drawn a cage, and on the ot.her side, a bird; by
turning the piece of cardhoanl briskly on an axis, . . . he cansed the two images to
appear in succession, yet the hird seemed to he in the cage, just as though there
had heen only one drawing. This phenomenon, which in itself is the hasis of all
cinema, depends on the pl'inciple of the persistence of retinal impressions . . . .
Once this principle is admitted, it is easy to understand that a movement decom­
posed, and presented in a rhythm of ten images or more per second, is perceived
by the eye as a perfectly continuous movement. The first apparatus that actually
wrought the miracle of artificial motion is the Phenakistiscope, constructed by the
Belgian physician Plateau as early as 1833. Still known today as an optical toy,
this apparatus . . . consisted of a disk on which were mounted dnnvings repre­
senting the suceessive phases of an action, whieh eould he observed as the disk was
rotated . . . . There . . . is an ohvious relation here to the animated cartoons of
today. . . . Researchers quickly saw . . . the interest in having . . . a succession of
photographs suhstituted I'ot, the drawings. Unfortunately, . . . only images running
at the minimum speed of a tenth of a second could work with such H design. For
this, we had to await the gelatinohromide plates that permitted the first instanta­
neous exposures. It was astronomy that initially provided an occasion for testing
chronophotography. On December 8, 1374, thanks to the passage of the planet
Venus past the sun, the astronomer <Pierre> Janssen was ahle to try out his
invention of a photographic revolver, which took a picture every seventy sec-
onds . . . . But the process of chronophotography was soon to become much more
rapid . . . . It was . . . when Professor Marey entered the lists with his photographic
rifle . . . that the result of twelve images per second was obtained . . . . All these
experiments were, up to then, purely scientifie (!) in character. The researchers
who conducted them . . . saw in chrollophotography a simple "means for analyzing
the movement.s of humans and animals. ' . . . At this point, in 1891, we meet with
. . . Edison, who had constructed two devices. One, the Kinetograph, was for
recording; the other, the IGnetoscope, was for pl'ojection . . . . Meanwhile, in 1891,
Marey's collahorator, < Georges> Demeny, had built a machine that allowed for the
recording of pictures and sound at the same time. His Phonoscope . . . was the !-irst
talkie. " Uoland Villiers, Le Cine,na et ses merveilles (Pal'is <1930» , pp. 9-16

« Let us take as an example of technical pl'ogress, which actually is regress, the
perfection of photographic devices. They are mueh more sensitive to light than the
old boxes with which daguerreotypes were produced. One hardly need eoncern
oneself ahout lighting when operating them now. They have a number of other
advantages to boot� especially where photographing faces is concerned� although
the portraits which one makes with them are doubtless much poorer than before.
With the older� less light-sensitive apparatus� multiple expressions would appear
on the plate� which was exposed for rather long periods of time; hence� on the final
image there would be a livelier and more universal expression, and this had its
function as well. Nevertheless, it would most certainly be false to regard the new
devices as worse than the older ones. Perhaps something is missing from them
which tomorrow will be found, and one can always do other things with them
besides photographing faces. Yet what of the faces? The newer devices no longer
work to compose the faces-but must 'faces be composed? Perhaps for these de­
vices there is a photographic method which would decompose faces. But we can be
quite sure of never finding this possibility realized . . . without first having a new
function for such photography." Brecht, Versuche <8-10 (Berlin, 1931» , p. 280

eleventh anniversary of the opening of their business-published in pamphlet
form a poem entitled, "Souvenir de la visite de Leurs Majestes l'Empereur et

��It is worth noting that the better photographers of our day are not concerned to
belabor the question . . . : 'Is photography an art?' . . . By their aptitude for
creating the evocative shock, [these photographers] prove their power of expres­
sion, and that is their revenge for the skepticism of Daumier." George Besson, La

The famous statement by Wiertz on photography can very likely be elucidated
through the following statement by Wey (of course, it becomes clear by this that
Wiertz's prognosis was mistaken) : "In reducing to naught whatever is inferior to
it, the heliograph predestines art to new forms of progress; in recalling the artist
to nature, it links him with a source of inspiration whose fecundity is unlimited:'

�'lf we consider only the practical side of divination� then to believe that previous
events in a man's life . . . can be directly represented by the cards he shuffles and
cuts, and which are then stacked by the fortuneteller in accordance with some
mysterious laws, is to believe the absurd. But this criterion of absurdity once ruled
out the harnessing of steam; it still rules out aerial navigation; it ruled out many
inventions: gunpowder, printing, the telescope, engraving, and also the most re­
cent great discovery of our time, the daguerreotype. If anyone had corne and told
Napoleon that a man or a building is incessantly, and at all hours, represented by
an image in the atmosphere, that all existing objects have there a kind of specter
which can be captured and pereeived, he would have consigned him to Charenton
as a lunatic. . . . Yet that is what Daguerre's discovery proved." Honore de Balzac,
Le Cousin Pons, in Oeuvres compl(�tes , vol. 18, La Comedie humaine: Scenes de la
vie parisienne, 6 (Paris, 1914), pp. 129-130. �\Just as physical objects in fact
project themselves onto the atmosphere, so that it retains this specter which the
daguerreotype can fix and capture, in the same way ideas . . . imprint themselves
on what we must call the atmosphere of the spiritual world, . . . and live on in it
spectrally (one must coin words in order to express unnamed phenomena). If that
be granted, certain creatures endowed with rare faculties are perfectly capahle of
discerning these forms or these traces of' ideas" (ibid . , p. 132).5         [Y8a,l ]

What author is being cited by Montesquiou in the following passage, whieh is taken
from a handwritten text forming part of a richly ornamented volume of memora­
hilia shown in a display case at the Guys exhibition, in Paris, in the spring of 1937?
"And that, in a few hasty words, is how it was: the Hrst exhibition of Constantin
Guys-newest surprise to be served up to us from his treasure-box of malice by
M. Nadar,r. the famous aeronaut and (should I say?) illustrious photographer.
Surely, this ingenious spirit, steeped in the past, has a right to that title, in its
noblest acceptation, and according to t.he admirable definition provided hy a pow­
erful and subtle thinker, in the course of some sublime pages: 'Humanity has also
invented, in its evening peregrinations-that is to say, in the nineteenth century­
the symbol of memory; it has invented what had seemed impossible; it has invented
a mirror that remembers. It has invented photography. '" <Ernest Hello, L 'Homme
(Paris 1872), p, 172>                                                           [Y8a,3]

"At no time in the past has art responded to aesthetic exigencies alone. The
Gothic sculptors served God in working for his faithful; the portraitists aimed at
verisimilitude; the peaches and the hares of a Chardin had their plaee in the
dining room, above the family dinner table, Individual artists in certain cases
(and they were few and far between, to be sure) may have suffered from this state
of affairs; art as a whole could only profit from it. This is the way it has been
throughout all the great artistic epoehs. In particular; the naive conviction that
they were only 'copying nature' was as salutar-y for the painters of those fortu­
nate epochs as it was theoretically unjustifiable, The old Dutch masters looked
upon themselves less as artists than as photographers, so to speak; it is only
today that the pbotographer is absolutely determined to pass for an artist. For­
merly, an engraving was above all a document, less exact (on tbe average) and
more artistic than a photograph, but having the same function, fulfilling by and
large the same practical role;' Together with this important insight we have, from
tills author, another no less important, according to whieh the pbotographer is
distinguished from the graphic artist not through the fundamentally greater real-
ism of his works, but through a more highly mechanized technique, which does
not necessarily dirninish his artistic activity. None of this prevents the author
from going on to say: "What is unfortuna.te [my italics] is not that today's photog­
rapher believes himself an a.rtist; what is unfortunate is that he actually has at
his disposal certain resources proper to the art of the painter:' Wladimir Weidk,
Les Abeilles d'Aristie (Paris), pp. 181-182, 184 ("I1Agonie de l'art") . Compare
Jochmann on the epic poem: "The general interest which such a poem excites,
the pride with which an entire people repeats it, its legislative authority over
opinions and sentiments-all this is grounded in the fact that it is nowhere taken
as a mere poem:' [Carl Gustav Jochmarm,] Uber die Sprache (Heidelberg, 1828),

In his " Morale du joujou" <Philosophy of Toys > , Baudelairc mentions, together
with thc stercoscope, the pheuakistiscope. ""The phenakistiscope, which is older, is
less well known. Imagine some movement or ot.her-for example, a dancer's or a
juggler's performance-divided up and decomposed into a certain numher of
movements. Imagine that eadI one of these movements-as many as twenty, if you
wish-is represented by a complete figure of the j uggler or dancer, and that these
are all printed round the edge of a circular piece of cardhoard.�' Baudelaire then
descrihes the mirror mechanism that enahles the viewer to see, in the twenty
openings of an outer circle, twenty little figurcs moving rhythmically in a continu­
ous action. Baudelaire, L )Art romantique (Paris), p. 146.7 Compare Y7a,1.

It was the pantograph, whose principle is equally at work in the physiognotrace,
that undertook to transcrihe automatically a linear scheme originally traced on
paper to a plaster mass, as required hy the process of photosculpture. Serving as
model in this process were twenty-four simultaneous views taken from differcnt
sides. Gautier foresees no threat to sculpture fro:m this process. What {�all prevent
the sculptor from artistically enlivening the mechanically produced figure and its
grouud? "But there is more: for all its extravagance, the ecntury remains economi­
(�al. Pure art seems to it something expensive. With t.he cheekiness of a parvenu, it
sometimes dares to haggle over masterworks. It is terrified of' marble and
hronze . . . . But photoseulpture is not so daunting as statuary . . . . Photoseulpturc

casts of stearin can be transposed into marble, into terracotta, into alabaster, or

demand in payment; it requests only the cost of materials." Theophile Gautier,

" He refined the illusionary art of the panormna and invented the diorama. He

the Temple of Solomon, Edinburgh in the sinister glow of a conflagration, and
Napoleon's Tomb transfigured naturally by the aureole of a rosy sunset: such are
the wonders that were shown here. A translator of Daguerre's own account of his
two inventions (1839) portrays very nicely the multiplicity of lights involved, great
and small, splendid, secret, and terrifying: �The spectator sits in a small amphi­
theater; the stage seems to him covered by a curtain which is still bathed in dark­
ness. Gradually, however, this darkness yields to a twilight. . . . : a landscape or
prospect emerges more clearly; the dawn is beginning. . . . Trees stand out from
the shadows; the contours of mountains, of' houses, become visible . . . ; the day
has broken. The sun climbs ever higher; through t.he open window of a house one
sees a kitchen stove slowly flaming up, while in a corner of the landscape a group of'
campers is ranged round a cooking pot, under which t.he campfire is beginning to
blaze; a forge becomes visible, its furnace g,iving off sparks as though . . . from
continuous stoking. Mter a while, . . . the daylight begins to wane, and the reddish
luster of t.he artiHcial flame grows stronger; once again there is advancing twilight,
and finally nocturnal gloom. Soon, however, the moonlight assert.s its rights, and
the region is visible anew in the soft tints of the illuminated night: a mariner's
lant.ern flares up on board a ship that is anchored in the foreground of a harbor; in
the background of an admirahle perspective of a church, the candles on the altar
are lighted, and the previously invisihle parishioners are now illuminated by the
rays streaming down from the altar; or grief-stricken men are standing at. the edge
of a landslide, its devastations lit up hy the moon at the very spot. where, shortly
before, the Ruffiherg had formed the hackground to the lovely Swiss landscape

The entrance of the temporal factor into the panoramas is brought about
through the succession of tin,es of day (with well-known lighting tricks). In this
way, the panorama transcends painting and anticipates photography. Owing to
its technological fonnation, the photograph, in contrast to the painting, can and
must be correlated with a well-defined and continuous segment of time (exposure
time) . In this chronological specifiability, the political significance of the photo­
graph is already contained in nuce.                                             [YIO,2]

" In these deplorable times, a new industry has developed, which has helped in no
small way to confirm fools in their faith and to ruin what vestige of the divine might
still have remained in the Fre;nch mind. Of course, this idolatrous multitude was
calling for an ideal worthy of itself and in keeping with its own nature. In the
domain of painting and statuary, the present-day credo of the worldly-wise . . . is
this: 'I believe . . . that art is, and can only be, the exact reproduction of na­
ture. . . . Thus, if an industrial process could give us a result identical to nature,
that would be absolute art.' An avenging God has heard the prayers of this multi­
tude. Daguerre was his messiah. And then they said to themselves: �Since photog­
raphy provides us with every desirable guarantee of exactitude' (they believe that,
poor madmen!), 'art is photography. ' From that moment onward, our loathsome
society rushed, like Narcissus, to contemplate its trivial image on the metallic
plate. A form of lunacy, an extraordinary fanaticism, took hold of these new
sun-worshippers. Strange abominations manifested themselves. By bringing to­
gether and posing a pack of rascals, male and female, dressed up like earnival­
time butchers and washerwomen, and in persuading these 'heroes' to 'hold' their
improvised grimaces for as long as the photographic process required, people
really believed they could represent the tragic and charming scenes of ancient
history. . . . It was not long before thousands of pairs of greedy eyes were glued to
the peepholes of the stereoscope, as though they were the skylights of the infinite.
The love of obscenity, which is as vigorous a growth in the heart of natural man as
self-love, could not let slip such a glorious opportunity for its own satisfaction . . . .

" The clever Parisienllcs . . . , in order to disseminate their fashions more easily,
made use of an especially conspicuous reproduction of their new creations­
namely, tailors' dummies . . . . These dolls, which still enjoyed considerahle impor­

They are the tme fairies o f these arcades (more salable and more worn than the
life-sized ones) : the fonnerly world-famous Parisian dolls, which revolved on
their musical socle and bore in their arms a doll-sized basket out of which, at the
salutation of the minor chord, a lambkin poked its curious muzzle. When Hack­
Hinder made use of this "newest invention of industrial luxury" for one of his
fairy tales, he too placed the marvelous dolls in the dangerous arcade which sister
Tinchen, at the behest of the fairy Concordia, has to wander in order finally to
rescue her poor brothers. "Fearlessly, Tinchen stepped across tile border into the
enchanted land, all tile while thinking only of her brothers. At first she noticed
notlring unusual, but soon the way led through an enonnous room entirely filled
with toys. She saw small booths stocked witll everything imaginable-carousels
with miniature horses and carriages, swings and rocking horses, but above all the
most splendid dollllouses. Around a small covered table, large dolls were sitting
on easy chairs ; and as Tinchen turned her gaze upon them, the largest and most
beautiful of tllese dolls stood up, made her a gracious bow, and spoke to her in a
little voice of exquisite refinement." The child may not want to hear of toys that
are bewitched, but the evil spell of this slippery path readily takes the form, even
today, of large animated dolls. D Advertising 0                               [Zl,2]

strongly suspect that in many of the eoaches, instead of the lady who would seem to
he seated inside, there was only a dummy which the owners of these fine vehicles
had dressed according to their own taste in shawls and satins and silks. " Karl

From the Ombres Chinoises <Chinese Shadows> of the PaIais-Royal: "'A . . .
demoiselle gave birth on stage, and the children could immediately "camper about
like moles. There were four of them, and they danced together a few moments after
the hirth in a pleasant quadrille. Another young woman started tossing her head
vigorously, and in the twinkling of an eye a second demoiselle had stepped fully
clothed from out of her head. This latter at once began dancing hut, the next
minute, was seized in turn with head-shaking; these were lahor pains, and a third
demoiselle stepped out of her head. She, too, immediately began dancing but soon
took to tossing her head like the others, and out of her arose the fourth demoiselle.
It continued in this manner until eight generations were there on the stage-all
related to one another through spontaneous generation, like lice." J. F. Benzen­

At a certain point in time, the motif of the doll acquires a sociocritical sig­
nificance. For example: "You have no idea how repulsive these automatons and

" In a shop on the Rue Legendre, in Batignolles, a whole series of female busts,
without heads or legs, with curtain hooks in place of arms and a perc aline skin of

onions, impaled on rods, or set out on tables . . . . The sight of this ehb tide of
bosoms, this Musee Curtius of breasts, puts one vaguely in mind of those vaults in
the Louvre where classical sculptures are housed, where one and the same torso,
eternally repeated, beguiles the time for those who look it over, with a yawn, on
rainy days . . . . How superior to the dreary statues of Venus they are-these dress­
makers' mannequins , with their lifelike comportment; how much more provoea­

:Marx explains that Hthe two material bases on which the preparations for ma­
chine-operated industry proceeded within manufal�ture during the period from
the sixteenth to the middle of the eighteenth century (the period in which manufac­
ture was developing from handicraft into large-scale industry proper) were the
clock and the mill (at first the corn mill, specifically, the water mill) . Both were
inherited from the ancients . . . . The clock was the first automatic device applied
to practical purposes; the whole theory of the production of regular motion was
developed through it. Its nature is such that it is hased on a comhination of semiar­
tistic handicraft and direct theory. Cardanus, for instance, wrote ahout (and gave
practical formulas for) the construction of clocks. German authors of the six­
teenth century (�alled clockmaking "learned (nonguild) handicraft' and it would he
possible to show from the development of the dock how entirely different the
relation between science and practice was in t.he context of handicraf't from what it
is, for instance, in modern large-scale industry. There is also no doubt thnt in the
eighteenth century the idea of applying automatic devices (moved by springs) to
production was first suggested by the clock. It can be proved historically that
Vaucanson's experiments along these lines had a tremendous influence on the
imagination of' English inventors. On the other hand, from the very beginning, as
soon as the water mill was invented, the mill possessed the essential elements of the
organism of a ma(�hine. The mechanicnl motive power. First., the motor, on which
it depends; then the transmission mechanism; and finally the working ma(�hine,
which deals with the material-each element existing independently of the others.
The theory of friction � and with it the investigations into the mathematical forms
of gear-wheels � cogs � and so forth, were all developed in connection with the mill;
the same applies to the theory of measurement of the degree of motive power� of the
best way of employing it � and so on. Almost all the great mathematicians since the
middle of the seventeenth century, so far as they dealt with practical mechanics
and worked out its theoretical side� started from the simple water-driven corn
mill. And indeed this was why the name Miihle, "mill,' which arose during the
manufacturing period, came to be applied to all mechanical forms of motive power
adapted to practical purposes. But in the case of the mill, as in that of the press,
the forge, the plough, and other implements, the work proper-that of beating,
crushing, grinding, pulverizing, and so on-has been performed from the very
first without human labor, even though the moving force was human or animal.
This kind of' machinery is therefore very ancient. . . . Hence, it is practically the
only maehinery found in the manufacturing period. The industrial revolution
begins as soon as mechanisms are employed where, from ancient times, the final
result has required human labor; hence not where, as with the tools mentioned
above, the material actually to be worked up has never been dealt with by the
human hand." Marx to Engels, January 28 � 1863 � from ]�ondon [in Karl Marx and

In his study <'La Mallte religieuse: Recherches sur la nature et Ia signification du

it, on account of its fateful significance, with the baneful automatons known to us
from myths. Thus Pandora: "'automaton fahricated by the blacksmith god for the
ruin of humankind, for that 'which all shaH I take to their hearts with delight, an
evil to love and embrace' (Hesiod, Works and Days, line 58).:1 We encotmtel' some­
thing similar in the Indian Krtya-those dolls, animated by sorcerers, which bring
about the death of men who embrace them. Our literature as welC in the motif of
femmes fatales, possesses the concept of a woman-machine, artificial, mechanical,
at variance with all living creatures, and above all murderous. No douht psycho­
analysis would not hesitate to explain this representation in its own terms by
envisaging the relations hetween death and sexuality and, more precisely, by

Episode of the February Hevolution. On the twenty-third, at eleven o � clock in the

extended, nearly immobile, as though to represent the Genius of Vengeance; lean­

''"The damage done to the morality of the improvident worker by the substitution

The devotion displayed in the wish to do well, in the concern for the interests of the
employer, or in the sacrifice of needs and desires irreconcilable with the regularity
of work is, in fact, more feasible for the worker than the devotion which would
lead to assisting his comrades with a sum of money. . . . The faculty of giving aid

Organization of the state workshops (ateliers nationaux) by Thomas. "It suffices
to mention that Emile Thomas divided the workers into brigades and companies,
and that their chiefs were elected by universal suffrage of the workers. Every
company had its flag, and Emile Thomas made use, for this organization, of other
civil engineers and of students from the Ecole Polytechnique, who, through their
youth, exerted a moral influence on the workers . . . . Nevertheless, although the
minister of public works ordered the state engineers to come up with proposals for
works . . . , the engineers in charge of bridges and roads decided not to comply with
the minister's order, for in France there had long been a great rivalry between
st.ate engineers and civil engineers, I and it was the latter who directed the national
workshops. Thomas was therefore left to his own resources, and he never could
assign to such an army of workers, whose ranks were daily swelling, any sort of
useful work. Thus, for example, he had trees from the outskirts of Paris brought
into the city to be planted along the boulevards, because during the struggles of
r ehruary the old trees on the boulevard had been cut down. The workers with the
....



trees paraded slowly across Paris, singing as they went . . . . Other workers, who
had the job, for example, of cleaning the railings of bridges, became an object of
derision for passersby, and so the majority of these workers also wound up passing
their time in mere cardplaying, singing, and the like . . . . The national workshops
before long became . . . the gathering place for all sorts of vagabonds and idlers,
whose lahor consisted exclusively in marching through the st.reets with their stan­
danl hearers, here and there mending the pavement or turning up earth, but on
the whok---singing and shouting, ragtag and unruly-doing whatever came into
t.heir heads . . . . One day, there suddenly appeared on the scene 600 actors, paint­
ers, artists, and agents, who together announced t.hat, since the republic was
guaranteeing work to all citizens, they too were putting forward their claim.

Episodes in the June Insurrection: '�Women were seen pouring boiling oil or hot
f2
water on the soldiers while shrieking and bellowing. In many places, insurgents
were given hrandy mixed with various ingl'edients , so that they would he excited to
madness . . . . Some women cut off the sexual organs of several imprisoned guards­
men, and we know that an insurgent dressed in woman"s clothing beheaded a
number of captured officers . . . ; people saw the heads of soldiers on pikes that
were planted atop harricades. Many things recounted were pure invention-for
example � that. the insurgents had pinioned captured guardsmen between two
hoards and sawed them, while alive, into pieces. On the other hand, things did in
fact occur that were no less horrihle . . . . Many insurgents used bullets of a type
that could not be removed from wounds after shooting, hecause a wire had heen
inserted into these bullets which sprang out. from the sides of them on impact.
Behind numerous barricades were spray guns, which were used to spray sulphuric
acid on attacking soldiers. It would be impossible to detail all the fiendish harllari­
ties perpetrated by both sides in this action; we shall merely ohserve that world
history can point to nothing comparable." EngHinder, vol. 2, pp. 288-289.

June Insurrection. �'On many closed shops, the insurgents would write: 'Respect
Property! Death to Thieves! ' Many Hags on the barricades bore the words: 'Bread
and Work.' On the Rue Saint-Martin, on the first day, a jeweler's shop stayed open
without being threatened by any sort of harm, while, a few steps beyond, a store
with a supply of scrap iron was plundered . . . . Many insurgents, during the bat.­
tle, had assemhled their wives and children on the barricades, and cried: ' Since we
can no longer feed them, we want at least to die all together! ' While the men
fought, the women made gunpowder and their children cast bullets, using every
piece of lead or tin that fell into their hands. Often the children molded the bullets
with thimbles. At night., while the combatants were sleeping, girls would drag
paving stones to the harricades." Englander, vol. 2 , pp. 291, 293.            [a2a,3]

"�In 1839, some workers in Paris founded a newspaper with the title La Ruche
populair·e . 2
•   •The editorial office of this puhlication was located in the poorest

section of the city, on the Rue des Quatre Fils. It. was one of the few worker-run
newspapers to have an audience among the genenll population, which can be
explained by the tendency it followed. That is, it took as its program the goal of
hringing hidden misery to the notiee of wealthy benefactors . . , . In the office of
this journal a register of misery lay open, in which every starveling eould inscribe
his name. It. was imposing, this register of misfortune, and since at this period Les
Mysteres de Pm'is, hy Eugene Sue, had hrought charity into fashion within high
sodety, one often saw private carriages pull up hefore the dirty premises of the
editorial office and blase ladies step forth to secure addresses of the unfortunate;
they would then deliver alms personally to these people and, in this way, derive a
novel stimulus for their jaded nerves. Each number of this workers' review began
with a summary enumeration of the poor people who had registered with the
editor; details of their plight could be found in the register itself. . . . Even after
the February Revolution, at a time when all social classes looked on one another
with distrust, . . . La Ruche populaire continued to facilitate personal contacts
between rich and poor. . . . This is all the more remarkahle in light of the fact that,
even during this period, all articles in La Ruche populaire were written by actual

HThe expansion achieved by industry in Paris during the past thirty years has
given a certain importance to the trade of ragpicker, which occupies the lowest
level on the industrial scale. Men, women, and children can all easily devote them­
selves to the practice of this trade, which requires no apprenticeship and ealls for
tools that are as simple as its methods-a basket, a hook, and a lantern comprising
the ragpieker's only equipment. The adult ragpicker, in order to earn 25-40 sous
per day (depending on the season), is ordinarily obliged to make three rounds, two
during the day and one at night; the first two take place from five o'clock in the
morning until nine o'cloek, and from eleven o'clock until [here, there are four
pages missing from the copy in the Bibliotheque Nationale! ] . Like salaried work­
ers, they have a habit of frequenting taverns . . . . Like them, and more than them,
they make a show of the expenditures which this habit entails. Among the older
ragpickers and particularly among the older women, spirits hold an attraction like
nothing else . . . . The ragpickers are not always content with ordinary wine in
these taverns; they like to order mulled wine, and they take great offense if this
drink does not contain, along with a strong dose of sugar, the aroma produced hy
the use of lemons." H.-A. Fregier, Des Classes dangereuses de la population

worst repute, and from whose circles emerges one Lacenaire, esteemed for his

(" The associated workers of Brighton consider machines to be absolutely

stead of dutifully serving, as the elves served the shoemaker in the German fairy
tale, the machines have behaved like Frankenstein's monster (German legend),

" If the vices of the lower classes were limited, in their effects, to those who in­
dulged in them, we may suppose that the upper classes would cease to concern
themselves with all these dismal questions, and would happily leave the world at
large to the sway of good and bad causes that rule over it. But . . . everything is
linked together. If poverty is the mother of vices, then vice is the father of crime;
and it is in this way that the interests of all the classes are conjoined." Eugene

" In the mind of the factory boss, workers are not men but forces, and expensive
ones at that-instruments more intractable and less economical than tools of iron
and fire . . . . Without being cruel, he can be completely indifferent to the suffer­

common. Douhtless Madame de Sevigm� was not an evil woman, . . . yet Madame

Brittany who had rioted over a tax, Madame de Sevigne, the impassioned mother,
speaks of hangings and of thrashings . . . in a light, cavalier tone that betrays not

��The Convention, organ of the sovereign people, aims to make mendicancy and
poverty disappear at a single stroke . . . . It guarantees work for all citizens who
need it . . . . Unfortunately, the section of the law that was designed specifically to
deal with mendicancy as a crime was more easily enforced than that which prom­
ised the benefits of national generosity to the poor. Repressive measures were
taken, and they have remained within the letter as well as the spirit of the law,

never existed, except in the decrees of the Convention!" E. Buret, De la Misere des

Hippolyte Passy, ex-minister, in a letter addressed to the temperance society of

needs, it is the capacity to encompass the future in his thoughts, that the poor man
lacks. His plight is due more to this lack than to any other." Cited in E. Buret, De

" There was a time, and it was not so long ago, when-all the while effusively
singing the praises of work-one never let on to the worker that the means by
which he derived his subsistence was not his freely willed labors but, in fact, a tax
levied on him by certain persons who fattened themselves by the sweat of his
brow . . . . It is what is called the exploitation of man by man. Something of this
sinister and deceptive doctrine has remained in the songs of the street. . . . Work is
still spoken of with respect, but tIus respect has something forced about it, some­
thing of a grimace . . . . It is nevertheless true that tIus way of viewing work is an
exception. More often, it is praised like a law of nature, a pleasure, or a benefit . . .
Against the lazy let us always do battle­
Great enemies of our society.
For if they complain of sleeping on straw,
It is only what they deserve.
In our stockyards, our factories, our mills,
Let us answer the call at day's dawning;
While we work our prodigious machines,
Let us hymn a fraternal refrain . . . "

weavers-the famous canuts-to eighteen sous for a workday of fifteen to sixteen
hours. The prefect had tried to induce the workers and bosses to agree to establish
a minimum salary level. The attempt having failed, an insurrection broke out on

I.I.A study of working conditions in the textile industry in 184,0 revealed that, for
one fifteen-and-a-half-hour day of active work, the average salary was less than
two francs for men and barely one franc for women. The suffering . . . got worse,
especially beginning in 1834, because, civil unrest being finally quelled, industrial
enterprises multiplied so rapidly that, within ten years, the population of the cities

hats in front of the Crucifix taken from the chapel and escorted it all the way to the

On December 8, 1831, the procapitalist Journal des debats takes a stand on the
Lyons insurrection. "The article in Le Journal des debats produced a great sensa-
tion. The enemy of the workers had brought into clear relief the international
significance of the Lyons symptom. Neither the republican nor the legitimist press,
however, wished to present the question in such dangerous terms . . . . The legiti­
mists . . . protested for purely demagogic reasons, since at that moment it was the
intention of this party to play the working class off against the Hberal bourgeoisie
in the interests of reestablishing the elder line of Bourbons; the republicans, on the
other hand, had an interest in playing down, as far as possible, the purely prole­
tarian cast of the movement . . . in order . . . not to lose the working class as a
future ally in the struggle against the July monarchy. Nevertheless, the immediate
impression produced by the Lyons uprising was so wholly incommensurable, so
painful for contemporaries, that for this renson alone it has already attained a
spedal place in history. The generation which had witnessed the July Revolution
. . . was thought, in effect, to have nerves of steel. Yet they saw in the Lyons
insurrection something entirely new . . . , which alarmed them an the more insofar
as the workers of Lyons themselves seemed manifestly not to see or understand this
new dimension." E. Tarle, I.�Der Lyoner Arbeiteraufstand," in Marx-Engels Ar­

If, in truth, a despicable mob,
Having fire and iron in its store,
Wants to shackle the body and soul
Of the people, truc child of God,
Reveal to these depraved,
o Republic, by foiling their plots,
Your great Medusa face
Ringed by t'ed lightning!


o tutelary Republic,
Do not ascend to the skies,
Ideal incarnated here on earth
By universal suffrage.

From the fourth verse:
Ah! Let no nocturnal surprise
Break in on the polls!
Stand guard round the ballot box:
'Tis the arch of our destiny.

Scene from the Fehruary Revolution. The Tuileries were plundered. "Neverthe­
less, the crowd had stopped, as a sign of respect, in front of the chapel. A student
took advantage of this moment to steal the sacred vessels, and in the evening he
had them taken to the EgHse Saint-Roell. He chose to carry� hy himself, the mag­
nificent sculpted Christ that found a place on the altar; a group of people followed
quietly in his steps, their hats removed and heads howed. This scene . . . was
reproduced on a stamp that could he seen, for a long time afterward, in the
windows of all the merchants who sell religious icons. The Polytechnician was
represented holding the Christ in his arms, displaying it hefore a kneeling crowd,
while he exclaimed: "Here is the master of us all!' These words were not actually
spoken, hut they conform to the sentiments of the population at a time when . . .

" The question of workers, like the question of the poor, was planted at the entry­
way to the Revolution. Since the children of the families of workers and artisans
could not cover the needs of a lahor-starved industry, factories made use of or­
phans as well. . . . The industrial exploitation of children and women . . . is one of
the most glorious achievements of philanthropy. Cheap food for workers, with a
. . . view to lowering wages, was likewise one of the favorite philanthropic notions
of the factory owners and political economists of the eighteenth century. . . . When
the French finally study the Revolution with a cold eye and without class preju­
dice, they will realize that the ideas which made for its greatness came from Swit­
zerland, where the bourgeoisie was already dominant: in fact, it was from Geneva
that A. P. Candolle imported the so-called "economic soup' . . . which created such
a furor in the Paris of the Revolution . . . . Even the dry and unblinking Volney
could not help being moved 'at the sight of this alliance of men of respectahle
position eagerly occupied in supervising a pot of' hoiling soup. '" Paul Lafargue,

"'Should three men happen to be in the street talking together about wages, or

of fear. . . . All I can say here is that . . . our grand Terrorists were by no means

Apropos of Cabet: " It is toward the end of 1848 that the discovery of the deposits
became known in Paris ? and almost immediately companies were formed to facili­

begun to operate. The 'Compagnie Parisienne' had the honor of transporting the
first group of travelers, and . . . these modern Argonauts entrusted themselves to a
blind Jason who had never even seen California: one Jacques Arago, . . . whose
account . . . of a voyage round the world was in part developed from another's
notes . . . . Newspapers were founded: La Californie, a general-interest paper on
the Pacific Oceanj the 'gold-bearing' Aurifere, monitor of the gold mines; L 'Echo

Revolutionary tactics and battles on the barricades, according to Les Misera.bles.
The night hefore the harricade fighting: "The invisible police of the entente
waH�hed everywhere, and maintained order-that is, night. . . . The eye which
might have looked from above into that mass of shadow would have caught a
glimpse in the distance here and there, perhaps, of indistinct lights, bringing out
broken and fantastic lines, outlines of singular constructions, something like
ghostly gleams coming and going among ruins; these were the barricades ." Oelt­

is from the chapter "'Faits (Pou l'histoire sort et que I'histoire ignot·e." "'The meet­
ings were sometimes periodic. At some, there were never more than eight or ten,
and always the same persons. In others, anybody who chose to entered, and the
room was so full that they were forced to stand. Some were there from enthusiasm
and passion; others because 'it was on their way to work. ' As in the time of the
Revolution, there were in these wine shops some female patriots, who embraced
the newcomers. Other expressive facts came to light. A man entered a shop, drank,
and went out, saying: "Wine merchant, whatever l owe, the revolution will pay.'
. . . A worker, drinking with a (,;omrade, made him put his hand on him to see how
warm he was; the other felt a pistol under his vest. . . . All this fermentation was
puhlic, we might almost say tranquil. . . . No singularity was wanting in this cri­
sis-still Imbterrallean, but already perceptible. Bourgeois talked quietly with
workers about the preparations. They would say, 'How is the uprising coming
along?' in the same tone in which they would have said, 'How is your wife?''' Vic­

Barri{�ade fighting in Les Miserubles. From the chapter '"Originalite de Paris. "
'"Outside of the insurgent qu.artiers, nothing is usually more strangely calm than
the physiognomy of Paris during an uprising . . . . There is firing at the streetcor­
ners, in an arcade, in a cul-de-sac; . . . corpses litter the pavement. A few streets
away, you call hear the clicking of hilliard halls in the cafes . . . . The carriages jog
along; people are going out to dine. Sometimes in the very quurti-e,. where there is
fighting. In 1831 a fusillade was suspendcd to let a wedding party pass hy. At: the
time of the insurrection of May 12, 1839, on the Rue Saint-Martin, a little infirm
old man, drawing a handcart l'mrmounted hy a tricolored rag, in which there were
decanters filled wit.h some liquid, went hack and forth from the harricade t.o the
troops and from the troops to the barricade, impartially offering glasses of co­
coa . . . . Nothing is more st.range; and this is thc peculiar characteristic of the
uprisings of Paris, which is not found in any ot.her capit.al. Two things are requisite

Patagonia. He gives a very poetical description of the land and its inhabitants.
"These men, the tallest on earth; these women, of whom the youngest are so
alluring after an hour's swim; these antelopes, these birds, these fish, these phos­
phorescent waters, this sky alive with clouds coursing to and fro like a flock of
wandering hinds . . .-all this is Patagonia, all this a virgin land rich and inde­

right to set foot on this part of the American continent? . . . Citizens, let England

he aims to reconcile the exercise of his profession with literary studies, he will
discover how uncongenial to intellectual development physical exhaustion can be"

disavows this relationship as little in his works in general as in these closing lines

The early inquests into workers' circumstances were conducted, for the most part,
by entrepreneurs, their agents, factory inspectors, and administrative officials.
"When the doctors and philanthropists who were conducting the inquest went to
visit the families of workers, they were generally accompanied by the entrepreneur
or his representative. Le Play, for example, advises one, when visiting the families
of workers, "to utilize the recommendation of a carefully chosen authority. ' He
counsels the adoption of utmost diplomacy in regard to individual members of the
family, and even the payment of small indemnities or the distribution of gifts: one

good behavior of the children, and, in suitahle fashion, dispense little presents to
all' (Les Oltvriers europeens [Paris], vol. 1, p. 223). In the course of the detailed
critique of inquest procedures which Audiganne promotes in the discussions of his
workers' circle, Le Play is spoken of in the following terms: 'Never was a falser
path marked out, despite the best intentions. It is purely a question of the system.
A mistaken point of view, an inadequate method of observation give rise to a
wholly arbitrary train of thought having no relation at all to the reality of society
and evincing, moreover, an incorrigible propensity for despotism and rigidity'
(Audiganne, p. 61). A frequent errol' in the conduct of the inquests, according to
Audiganne, is the air of ceremony with which the investigators carry out their
visits to the homes of the workers: 'If not a single special inquest undertaken
during the Second Empire yielded concrete results of any kind, the blame for this
rests, in large part, on the pomp with which the investigators paraded around'
(p. 93). Engels and Marx describe further the methods by which the workers were
induced to express themselves on the occasion of these recherches sociales and
even to present petitions against the reduction of their work time." Hilde Weiss,

Max Horkheimer, 5, no. 1 (Paris, 1936), pp. 83-84]. The passages from Audi­

In 1854, the affair of the carpenters took place. When the carpenters of Paris
decided to strike, proceedings were instituted against the leaders of the carpenters
for violation of the ban on coalitions. They were defended, in the first instance and
in the appeal, by Berryer. From his arguments before the court of appeals: �'It
cannot be this sacred resolve, this voluntary decision to abandon one's work
rather than not derive a just income from it, that has been marked out for punish­
ment by the law. No, it is the determination, instead, to restrain the freedom of
others; it is the interdiction of work, the hindering of others from going to their
place of work. . . . In order, then, for there to be a coalition, in the proper sense,
there must be some sort of restraint on the liberty of persons, a violence done to
the freedom of others. And, in fact, if this is not the true construction of' articles
415 and 416, would there not be, in our law, a monstrous inequality between the
condition of the workers and that of the entrepreneurs? The latter can take coun­
sel together to decide that the cost of labor is too high. . . . The law . . . punishes
the coalition of entrepreneurs only when their concerted action is unjust and
abusive . . . . Without reproducing the same set of words, the law reproduces the
same idea with respect to workers. It is by the sound interpretation of these arti­
cles that you will consecrate the equality of condition that ought to exist between
these two elasses of individuals." < Pierre-Antoine> Berryer, Oeuvres: Plaidoyers,

"If an agitator is to achieve lasting results, he must speak as the representative of

Marx on Proudhon: i.'The February Revolution certainly came at a very inconven­
ient moment for Proudhon, who had irrefutably proved only a few weeks before
that the 'era of revolutions l was ended forever. His speech to the National Assem­
bly, however little insight it showed into existing conditions, was worthy of every
praise. Coming after the June Insurrection, it was an act of great courage. In
addition, it had the fortunate consequence that Thiers-by his reply (which was
then issued as a special booklet), in which he opposed Proudhon's proposals­
proved to the whole of Europe what an infant.ile catechism formed the pedestal for
this intellect.ual pillar of the French bourgeoisie. Compared with Thiel's, Proud­
hon's stature indeed seemed that of an antediluvian colossus . . . . His attacks on
religion, the church, and so on were of great merit locally at a time when the
French socialists thought it desirable to showl by their religiosity, how superior
they were to the bourgeois Voltaireanism of the eighteenth century and the Ger­
man godlessness of the nineteenth. Just as Peter the Great defeated Russian har­
barism by barbarity, Proudhon did his best to defeat French phrase-mongering by
phrases." Marx to Schweitzer, London, January 24, 1865, in Karl Marx and Frie­

been previously advanced by the English economist Sadler in IB30. Proudhon
says: " "This immense power that results from the union and harmony of laborers,
from the convergence and simultaneity of their efforts, has not been recompensed
hy the capitalist. ' Thus it is that 200 grenadiers succeeded, within several hours,
in raising the obelisk of Luxor on the Place de la Concorde, whereas a single man
working for 200 days would have obtained no result at all. "Separate t.he laborers
from one another, and the amount paid daily to each would perhaps exceed the
value of each individual product, but this is not. what is at issue here. A force of a
thousand men working over a period of twenty days has been paid what a single
man would earn in fifty-five years; hut this force of a thousand has produced, in
twenty days, what the power of a single man, multiplied across a million centuries,
could not achieve. Is there equity in the marketplace?'" Cited in Armand Cuvil­

Barricades: "'At lline o'clock in the evening� on a beautiful summer night, Paris

its boulevards devastated, its dark streets deserted, Paris was like nothing ever
seen before. Thebes and Herculaneum are less sad. No noises, no shadows, no
living beings-except the motionless worker who gnarded the barricade with his
rifle and pistols. To frame it all: the hlood of the day preceding and the uncertainty

" It is impossible not to be struek hy two moral phenomena which arc like the
symptoms of a disease that today� in its own particular way� is ravaging the hody
and limbs of society: we are speaking of suicide and revolt. Impatient wit.h all law,
discontented with all posit.ion, t.he individual rises up equally against human na­
t.ure and against mankind, against himself and against societ.y. . . . The mall of our
time, and the Frenchman perhaps more than any ot.her, having violently broken
with the past . . . and looked with fear toward a fut.ure whose horizon already
seems to him so gloomy, kills himself if he is weak . . . , if he lacks faith in . . . t.he

good from evil." J. Tissot, De la Manie du suicide et de l'esprit de " evolte (Paris,

A paradoxical description of Daumier's art: "Caricature, for him, became a sort
of philosophic operation which consisted in separating a man from that which
society had made of him, in order to reveal what he was at bottom, what he
could have been under different circumstances. He extracted, in a word, the
latent self:' Edouard Drumont, Les Heros et les pitres (paris <1900» , p. 299 ("Dau­

��Many writers . . . acquired fame and fortune by mocking the faults and infirmi­

model: he planted himself before the mirror, listened to himself thinking and

The Pagan School is opposed not only to ti,e spirit of Christianity but also to the
spirit of 1110dernity. Baudelaire illustrates t±lls, in his essay "IJEcole palcrme," with
the aid of Daumier: "Daumier did a remarkable series of lithographs, L'Histoire
allcienne, which was, so to speak, the best paraphrase of the fmTIous saying, 'Who
will deliver us from the Greeks and Romans?' Daumier pounced brutally upon
antiquity and mythology, and spit on them. The hotheaded Achilles, the prudent
Ulysses, the wise Penelope, that great nitmy Telemachus, the beautiful Helen
who ruined cfi'oy, the ardent Sappho, patroness of hysterical women-all were
portrayed with a farcical homeliness that recallcd those old carcasses of classical
actors who take a pinch of snuff in the wings." Charles Baudelaire, L'Art roman­
tique, cd. Hachette (Paris), vol. 3 , p. 305.5                                     [b2,3]

""If we could have our wish . . . ' This desire, this regret-Baudelaire was the first
to interpret it, twice giving voice, in L 'Art romantique, to unexpected praise for a
poet of his day, the author of a "Chant des ouvriers," that Pierre Dupont who, he
tells us, "after 1848 . . . attained great glory.' The specification of this revolution­
ary date is very important here. Without tlus indication, we might have trouhle
understanding the defense of popular poetry, and of an art 'inseparahle from
utility,' I on the part of a writer who could pass for the chief architect of the
rupture of poetry and art with the masses . . . . 1848: that is the hour when the
street beneath Baudelaire's window begins in very truth to tremhle, when the
theater of the interior must yield him up in all magnificence, to the theater of the
exterior, as someone who incarnates, at the highest level, the concern for human
emancipation in all its forms, as well as the consciousness, alas, of everything that
is ridiculously ineffectual in this aspiration alone, wherehy the gift of the artist
and of the man becomes total-Baudelaire's anonymous collaboration on Le Salut
public of Fehruary 27 and 28 effectively proving the point. . . . This communion of
the poet, of the authentic artist, with a vast class of people impelled hy their ardent
hunger for freedom, even partial freedom, has every chance of emerging spontHne­
ously at times of great social ferment, when reservations can be laid aside. Rim­
haud, in whom the claims of the human tend, nonetheless, . . . to follow an infinite
course, places, from the outset, all his confidence and elan vital in the Commune.

On Victor Hugo: " He was . . . the poet not of his own sufferings . . . but of the
passions of those around him. The mournful voices of the victims of the Terror . . .
made their way into the Odes. Then the trumpet blasts of the Napoleonic victories
resounded in other odes . . . . Latcr on, he felt obliged to let the tragic cry of
militant democracy pass through him. And what is La Legerule des siecles . . . if
not the echo of the great turmoil of human history? . . . It often seems as though he
had collected the sighs of all families in his domestic verse, the hreath of all lovers
in his love poems . . . . It is for this reason that, . . . thanks to some mysterious
quality in him that is always collective and general, Victor Hugo's poetry possesses
an erie character." Paul Bourget, ohituary notice for Victor Hugo in Le ]onrnal
des debats [Victor lingo £levant l 'opinion (Paris, 1885), pp. 96-97] '         [d2a,4]

Victor Hugo hearkens to the inner voice of' the crowd of his ancestors: "'The crowd
to which he list.ened admiringly in himself, and which he heard as the herald of his
popularity, inclined him, in faet, toward the exterior crowd-toward the Idola
Fori,;' toward the inorgallie hody of the masses. . . . He searched in the tumult of
the sea for the roar of applause." ��He spent fifty years draping his love of confu­

From Baudelaire �s essay on Pierre Dupont: ��We had been waiting so many years
for some solid, real poetry! Whatever the party to which one belongs, whatever the
prejudices one has inherited, it is impossible not to be moved by the sight of that
sickly throng breathing the dust of the workshops, swallowing lint, becoming satu­
rated with white lead, mercury, and all the poisons necessary to the creation of
masterpieces, sleeping among vermin in the heart of districts where the humblest
and greatest virtues live side by side with the most hardened vices and with the
dregs from prisons. That sighing and languishing throng to which the earth owes
its marvels, which feels jlowing in its veins an ardent red blood, which looks long
and sadly at the sunshine and shade of the great parks and, for its only comfort
and consolation, bawls at the top of its voice its song of salvation: Let us love one
another . . ." -"'There will come a time when the accents of this worldngman's
Marseillaise will circulate like a Masonic password, and when the exiled � the aban­
doned, and the lost, whether under the devouring tropical sky or in the snowy
wilderness, will be able to say, �I have nothing more to fear-I am in France!' as he
hears this virile melody perfume the air with its primordial fragrance: �Nous dont

!.'Eugene Sue . . . was in certain respects . . . similar to Schiller-not only in his

On Victor Hugo: !"This Ancient, this unique genius, this unique pagan, this man of
unparalleled genius was ravaged by, at the very least, a double politician: a politi­

Romantic. This genius was corrupted by talent(s)." Charles Peguy, Oeu.vres com­

of Shakespeare's hirthday (April 23, 1864), he speaks of the "book by Victor Hugo
on Shakespeare, a book which-full of beauties and stupidities like all his books­
is almost certain to vex even the most ardent of his admirers" (cited in Barthou,
p. 50). And: "Hugo, priestlike, with his head always bent-too bent to see any­
thing except his navel" (cited in Barthou, p . 57) . "                       [d6,2]

The publishers of Balzac's Feuilleton des journau.x politiques offered certain
books at lower-than-official prices by bypassing book retailers. Balzac himself
takes pride in this initiative, which he defends against criticisms from without, and
which he expects will create the immediate bond between publisher and public that
was his aim. In a sample issue of the newspaper, Balzac sketehes the history of the
book trade and of publishing sinee the Revolution of 1789, to conclnde with the
demand: " We must finally see to it that a volume is produced exaet.ly like a loaf of
hread, and is sold like a loaf of bread, so that there would be no intermediary
between an author and a purchaser other than the bookseller. Then this business
mIl be the most seeure of all . . . . When a bookseller is required to lay out some
twelve thousand francs for every project, he will no longer engage in any that are
risky or ill-conceived. They will realize, then, that instruction is a necessity of
their profession. A elerk who has learned in what year Gutenberg printed the
Bihle will no longer imagine that being a bookseller is only a matter of having one's
name written over a shop." Honore de Balzac, Critique litteraire. introduction by

Fees. Victor Hugo receives 300,000 francs from Lacroix for Les Miserables, in
exchange for rights to the novel for twelve years. "It was the fi r st time Victor
Hugo had received such a sum. 'In twenty-eight years of furious labor; Paul
Souday has said, 'with an oeuvre of thirty-one volumes . . . , he had made a total
of about 553,000 francs. . .. He never earned as much as Lamartine, Scribe, or

�'When Eugene Sue, following upon . . . Les Mysteres de Londres <by Paul

propose to arouse the interest of the reader with a description of society's under­
world. He began by charact.erizing his novel as an histoirefantastique . . . . It was
a newspaper article that decided his fut.ure. La Phalange praised the bcginning of
the novel and opened t.he aut.hor's eyes: 'M. Sue has just. set out on the most
penet.rating critique of society. . . . Let us congratulate him for having recount.ed
. . . the fright.ful sufferings of the working class and the cruel indifference of soci­
ety. ' The author of this article . . . received a visit from Sue; they talked-and that
is how the novel already underway was pointed in a new direction. . . . Eugene Sue
convinced himself: he took part in the electoral hattIe and was elected . . .

Balzac (like Le Play) was opposed to the parceling out of large estates: "My God,
how could anyone fail to realize that the wonders of art are impossible in a
country without great fortunesl" (cited in Cbarles Calippe, p. 36). Balzac likewise
draws attention to the disadvantages that result when peasants and petty bour­
geois hoard their money, and calculates how many billions are in this way with­
drawn from circulation. On the other hand, the only remedy he can recommend
is for the individual, by hard work and wise economy, to become a landed

Jules Bertaut sees Balzac's importance in terms of the action of significant figures
in a milieu determined by the types of that day's society-which is to say, in terms
of character study permeated by the study of manners. Apropos of the latter, he
writes: "One need only peruse the innumerable physiologies . . . to see how far this
literary vogue has come. From the Schoolboy to the Stockbroker, and taking
account of the Dry Nurse, the Sergeant, and the Seller of Countermarks in be­
tween, it is an endless succession of petits portraits . . . Balzac knows the genre

'�'Victor Hugo,' says Eugene Spuller, 'had gone along with the views of the reac­

the national workshops, on June 20, 1848, he declares them a double error-from
a political as well as a financial standpoint. . . . In the Legislative Assembly, on the
other hand, he turns to the left, becoming one of its . . . most aggressive orators. Is
this because of an evolution . . . , or is it due to wounded pride and personal
bitterness against Louis Napoleon, under whom he supposedly wished-even ex­
pected-to become minister of public instruction?" E . Meyer, Victor Hugo it la

��Communism, . . . that . . . logic of democracy, is already boldly attacking society
in its moral assumptions? whence it is evident that the proletarian Samson, grown
prudent, will henceforth sap the pillars of society in the cellar, instead of shaking
them in the banquet hall. " Balzac, Les Paysans;H (cited in Abbe Charles Callppe,

Travel literature: ��It is France that first . . . reinforced its armies with a brigade of
geographers, naturalists, and archaeologists. The great achievements in Egypt . . .
marked the advent of an order of works previously unknown . . . . The Expedition
scientifique de Ia Moree and the Exploration scientifique de 1'Algerie are worthy
additions to this great line . . . . Whether scientific in spirit, serious or light, . . .
accounts by travelers . . . have, in our time, found a considerable vogue. Along
with novels, they form the staple fare in reading rooms, numbering, on average,
some eighty works per year, or twelve hundred publications in fifteen years."
This, on average, is not much more than in other fields of natural science. Charles

Travel literature. It finds an unexpected application during the Chamber's debate
on deportations (April 4, 1849). "'Farconet, who was the first to oppose the proj­
ect, brought up the question of the salubrity of the Marquesas Islands . . . . The
member who had presented the report replied by reading some travel accounts
which depicted the Marquesas as . . . a veritable paradise . . . . This, in turn, drew
. . . the angry response: 'To offer idylls and bucolics on a subject so grave is
ridiculous. '" Eo Meyer, Victor Hugo a la tribune (Chambery, 1927), p . 60. [d9,4]

The idea for La Comedie humaine came to Balzac in 1833 (the year in which Le
Mideein de campagne was published). The influence of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire's
dleory of types was decisive. To this was added, on ilie literary side, ilie influence
of Scott's and Cooper's cycles of novels.                                           [d9,5]

In its second year of publication, in 1851, the �'Almanach des reformateurs . . . ,

Derivation of ilie feuilleton novel, whose appearance in newspapers inlmediately
entailed dangerous competition for periodicals and a marked decline in ilie pro­
duction of literary criticism. The periodicals, in turn, had to decide wheilier to
publish novels in installments. rThe first to do so were La Revue de Paris (edited by
Veron?) and La Revue des deux mondes. "Under the old state of affairs, a journal
wiili a subscription rate exceeding eighty francs was supported by iliose whose
political convictions it expressed....Under the new arrangements, a journal had
to live by advertisements, . . . and in order to have lots of advertisements, the
fourth page, which had become a publicity display, had to pass before the eyes of
a great many subscribers.In order to have lots of subscribers, some bait had to be
found that would speak to all opinions at the same time, and that would substi­
tute, for political interest, an item of general interest. ... Tbis is how, by starting
from the forty-franc newspaper and proceeding on to the advertisement, we
arrive, almost inevitably, at the serial novel." Alfred Nettement, Hislaire de la
litteralurejran,aise saus Ie Gauvernemenl de Juillet (paris, 1859), vol. 1, pp. 301-

"'From time to time, one could read, III Le Journa.l des debuts, articles by
M. Michel Chevalier or M. Philarete Chasles, . . . articles of a socially progressive
tendency. . . . The progressive articles in the Debats were customarily published
during the fortnight preceding subscription renewals, which occurred every four
months. On the eve of large renewals, Le Journal des debuts could be found
flirting with radicalism. This helps to explain how Le Journal des debats could
undertake the hold publication of Les Mysteres de Paris . . . -but this time, that
imprudent newspaper had gone further than it realized. As a consequence, many
wealthy bankers withdrew their support for the Debats . . . in order to found a
new paper, . . . I�e Globe. This worthy predecessor of L 'Epoque . . . was aimed at
doing justice to the incendiary theories of M. Eugene Sue and of La Denwcratie

The boheme. "With Un Prince de la boheme (1840), Balzac wanted to portray a
. . . characteristic of this nascent boheme. The amorous preoccupations . . . of
Rusticoli de la Paiferine are only a Balzacian expansion upon the triumphs of
Marcel and Rodolphe, 15 which would soon follow. . . . This novel contains a gran­
diloquent definition of hohemianism , . . . the first . . . : �The boheme-what
should he called the doctrine of the Boulevard des ltaliens-consists of young
people, . . . all men of genius in their way? men as yet little known ? but soon to
become known . . . . Here one meets writers, administrators, soldiers? journalists,
artists! If the emperor of Russia purchased this bohemia for twenty million
francs, . . . and if it were subsequently deported to Odessa, then in a year Odessa
would be Paris.' . . . During this same period, George Sand . . . and Alphonse
Karr . . . initiated bohemian circles . . . . But these were imaginary bohemias; and
that of Balzac was entirely fantastic. The hohemianism of Theophile Gautier, on
the other hand, and that of Murger, have been talked about so much . . . that
today we can get an idea of what they were. To tell the truth, Gautier and his
friends . . . did not realize right away, in 1833, that they were bohemians; they
were content with calling themselves �Jeune France' <Young France> . . . . Their
poverty was merely relative . . . . This hohcmianism . . . was the boheme galante; it
could just as well be called gilded bohemianism, the boheme doree . . . . Ten or
fifteen years later, around 1843 , there was a new bohemia . . . , the true boheme.
Theophile Gautier, Gerard de Nerval, Arsene Houssaye were then approaching
forty; Murger and his friends were not yet twenty-five. This time, it was a genuine
intellectual proletariat. Murger was the son of a concierge tailor; ChampHeury's
father was a secretary at the town hall in Laon; . . . Delvau's father was a tanner in
the Faubourg Saint-Marcel; Com'bees family were quasi-peasants . . . . Champ­
Heury and Chintreuil wrapped packages in a bookstore; Bonvin was a working­
class typographer." Pierre Martino, Le Roman realiste saus le Second Empire

From Lamartine's "Lettre en vel'S a M. Alphonse Karl''':

Every man can proudly sell the sweat of his brow;
T sell my hunch of grapes as you do your flowers,
Happy when its nectar, under the crush of my foot.,
FLows in amher streams through all my works,
Producing for its master, drunk with its high price,
Much gold with which to buy much freedom!
Fate has reduced us to counting OUI' wages;
Day-wages you, night-wages me: two mercenaries.
But bread well earned is hread well broken, too:
o the glory of free men heholden to none for their salt!

VCllillot, who cites this text, has this to say: ��Until now, it was felt that the freedom
that can he purchased with money is not the sort that men of' conscience are in the
habit of pursuing . . . . What! . . . You don't know that the way to be free is to heap
scorn on gold? To secure this freedom acquired through gold, . . . you produce
your hooks in the same mercenary fashion as you produce vegetables and wine.
You will demand of your fa{�ulties a double or a triple harvest; you will start to
market your early produce; the muse will no longer visit voluntarily, but will toil
night and day like a drudge. . . . And in the morning, you will cast before the
public a page scribbled over in the course of your nocturnal lucubrations; you will
not even bother rereading the rubbish that covers it, though you will certainly
have counted the number of lines it contains. " Louis Veuillot, Pages choisies, ed.

" In vain Sainte-Beuve allows himself, out of a deep-rooted antipathy, to fly into a
rage against the author of La Comedie humaine. But he is right to observe that "the
vogue for serial publication, which required, with each new chapter, that the

extreme and desperate pitch. '" Cited in Fernand Baldensperger, ""Le Raffermisse­

Apropos of Lamartine and Hugo: "Instead of fostering the notion . . . that people
should follow devotedly in the steps of these sincere souls, we should investigate
the underside of all sincerity. But bourgeois culture and democracy are too greatly
in need of this value! The democrat is a man who wears his heart on his sleeve; his
heart is an excuse, a testimonial, a subterfuge. He is professionally heartwarming,
so he can dispense with being truthful." N. Guterman and H. Lcfebvre, La Con­

On Lamartine: ""The fatuity of t.he poet is indescrihable. Lamartine deems himself

convinced that he draws up from the depths of his soul ideas that he actuaHy

Alfred Delvau (1825-1867): "He was a child of the quartier Mouffetard . . . . In
1848, he hecame private secretary to Ledru-Rollin, who was then minister of the

himself to letters, making his debut with several newspaper articles . . . . In Le
Journal amusant, Le Figaro, and some other journals, he published articles deal­
ing mainly with Parisian customs and practices. For some time, at Le Siecle, his
special assignment was t.he Paris town council. " During the second half of the
1850s, he was in exile in Belgium , where he had fled to escape a prison sentence
incurred while he was editor of Le Rabelais. Later, he would endure prosecutions
for plagiarism. Information in Pierre Larousse, Grand Dictionnaire universel du

During the reign of Napoleon III, Benjamin Gastineau had already been twice
deported to Algeria. "Under the Paris Commune. M. Gastineau was named inspec­

Pierre Dupont: ""Ine poet, as he says in one of his little poems, 'listens, by turns,
to the forests and the crowd.' And in fact it is the great mstic symphonies, the
voices through which nature in its entirety speaks, as well as the clamor, the
griefs, the aspirations and lamentations of the crowd, that make for his double
inspiration. The song such as our fathers knew it ..., the drinking song or even
the simple ballad, is utterly foreigoto him." Pierre Larousse, < Grand> Dictionnaire

Gustave Simon descrihes the scenes that took place in front of Paguerre's hook­
shop when the second and t.hird parts of Les iWiserables were delivered: '''On May
15, 1862,' he writes, 'a little before 6:00 in the morning, a dense crowd was gather­
ing on the Rue de Seine before a shop that was still closed. The crowd kept growing
larger and, impatient with waiting, hecame noisy, even riotous . . . . The pavement
was obstructed by an impassable jumble of delivery carts, private carriages, cabs,
carioles, and even wheelbarrows. People had empty baskets on their hacks . . . . It
was not yet 6:30 when the crowd, hecoming more unruly by the minute, started
pushing against the shopfront, while those in the vanguard knocked with redou­
bled force on the door. Suddenly, a window was opened on the second fioor; a lady
appeared and exhorted the assemhled citizens to be more patient. . . . The shop to
which they were preparing to lay siege was quite inoffensive; only hooks were sold
there. It was Paguerre's hookshop. The people hurling t.hemselves at the building
were bookstore clerks, agents, huyers, and hrokers. The lady who spoke from her
second-floor window was Madame Paguerre. '" Alhert de Besancourt, Les Pam­

Perrot de Chezelles � in his pamphlet (.�Examen dn livre des Miserables de M. Victor
IIugo �� (Paris, 1863), makes this more general contrihution to the characterization
of Victor Hugo: " In his dt'amas and novels he takes for his heroes a lackey like Buy

Les Miserables depends, for its principal facts, on actual events. Underlying the
condemnation of Jean Valjean is a case in which a man who had stolen a loaf of
bread for his sister 's children was condemned to five years ' penal servitude.
Hugo documented such things with great exactitude .                               [d12,1]


A detailed representation of Lamartine 's behavior during the Fehruary Revolu­
tion is provided hy Pokrowski in an article that hases itself, in part, on diplomatic
reports hy KisseHov, the Russian ambassador to Pads at that time. These reports
are cited in the course of the article. '""Lamartine . . . admitted,' Kisseliov writes,
'that., for the time heing, France found itself in a situation that always tends to
arise when one government has just fallen and the other is not yet firmly in place.
He added, however, that the population had given proof of so lnnch good sense, of
such respect. for family and property, that lawful order in Paris would be pre­
served t.hrough the momentum of things in themselves and through the good will of
the masses . . . . In eight or ten days, continued Lamartine, a national guard of
200,000 men would be organized, in addition to which there were 15,000 mounted
police, whose spirits were exeeHent, and 20,000 front-line troops, who alreudy had
encircled Paris and were to march on the dty. ' Here we must pause for a moment.
It is wen known that the pretext for recalling the troops, which since Ii'ehruary had
heen stationed at a distance from Paris, was the workers' demonstration of April
16; the conversation between Lamartine and IGsseliov, however, took place on
April 6. How hrilliantly, therefore, Marx divined (in Die KI(1.ssenlriimpje in F1'Ctnli:­

(.(.By 1862, the year in which Victor Hugo publishes Les Miserables, the number of
illiterates has considerably diminished in France . . . . In proportion as an edu­
cated populace begins to patronize hookshops, authors begin choosing their he­
roes from the crowd, and the one in whom this phenomenon of socialization can
best be studied is Hugo himself, the first great poet who gave to his literary works
commonplace titles: Les MiserabIes, Les Travailleurs de ia mer." Pierre Hamp,

TI,ese remarks on Scott might be applied to V ictor Hugo: "He regarded rhetoric,
the art of the orator, as the immediate weapon of the oppressed . ... And it is odd
to reflect that he was, as an author, giving free speech to fictitious rebels while he
was, as a stupid politician, denying it to real ones. " G. K. Chesterton, Dickens)

The same holds for Victor Hugo as for Dickens: "Dickens stands first as a defiant
monument of what happens when a great literary genius has a literary taste akin
to that of the community. For this kinship was deep and spiritual.Dickens was
not like our ordinary demagogues and journalists. Dickens did not write what
the people wanted. Dickens wanted what the people wanted. .. . He died in
1870; and the whole nation mourned him as no public man has ever been
mourned; for prime ministers and princes were private persons compared with
Dickens.He had been a great popular king, like a king of some more primal age
whom his people could come and see, givingjudgment under an oak tree:' C. K.

detective fiction. Only, it must be borne in mind that the combinative procedure
of the detective stands opposed here to an empirical approach that is modeled on

'''Every time a serial novel threatened to carry off the prize, Balzac redouhled his

dominating the serial format, and it was just at that point that the series entitled
Splendeurs et miseres des courtisanes began. In 1842-184·3, Les Mysteres de Paris
appeared, and Balzac responded with A Combien l'Amour revient aux vieillards.

Nettement draws attention to the particular significance whim the period for
subscription renewal had for the newspapers. There was a tendency, at such
times, to begin publishing a new novel in the feuilletons even before the old one
had finished its run. In tins same period of development, the reaction of readers
to the novels started to make itself felt more inlmediately. Publishers took note of
this tendency and gauged their speculations beforehand according to the title of
the new novel.                                                               [dIS,2]

The novel published in installments can be seen as a precursor of the newspaper
feuilleton. In 1836, a periodical of Karr's for the first tinle undertook to publish
such instalhnents-whim later could be gathered under one cover-as a supple­
ment for its readers.                                                         [dIS, 3]


Political attitude of Romanticism, according to Baudelaire �s conception in "Petrus
Borel": "If' the Restoration had turned into a period of glory, Romanticism would
not have parted company with royalty." "'Later on, . . . a misanthropic republi-
canism joined the new school, and Petrus Borel was the . . . most paradoxical
expression of the spirit of the Bousingots . . . . This spirit, . . . contrary to the
democratic and bourgeois passion which later so cruelly oppressed us, was excited
both by an aristocratic hatred . . . for kings and the bourgeoisie, and by a general
sympathy . . . for all that . . . was . . . pessimistic and Byronic ." Charles Baude­

and nothing is more amusing than the explanations of this marvel that are offered
in all seriousness by our salon savants. M. Daguerre can rest easy, however, for

Dickens: "�There was a great deal of the actual and unbroken tradition of the

Prison there was a great deal of the capture of the Bastille. There was, above all, a
cel·tain reasonable impatience which was the essence of the old Republican, and
which is quite unknown to the Revolutionist in modern Europe. The old Radical
did not feel exactly that he was �in revolt'; he felt if anything that a number of

1852: ��The reputation of the author of Hernani had passed, by the peculiar con­
duits of bohemerie and utopianism, from the Latin Quarter to the faubourgs of
Paris. Then, suddenly, the great metaphorist had had the revelation of the dogma
of the sovereign people . . . . This revelation encompassed, at the same time, the
projects of Michelet and Quinet and many another writer of lesser ability, such as

Hugo: '�It was during one of those desolate excursions that the sight of a ship run
aground on a nameless rock, its keel in the ail', gave Hugo the idea for a new
Robinson Crusoe, which he would call Les Travailleurs de la mer <The Toilers of
the Sea> , lahor and the sea comprising the two poles of his exile . . . . Whereas in
. . . Les Contemplations he had lulled his agonizing regret for the loss of his eldest
daughter to the sea, he went on, in the prose of Les Travailleurs, to soothe the
sadness he felt for the daughter who had sailed away. This marine element, then,
was decidedly linked, by chains of black, to his destiny. " Leon Daudet, La

Juliette Dronet: " It is likely . . . that, beyond the question of' former lovers and of

From the record of the spiritualist sessions on Jersey (cited in Albert Beguin,
L'Ame Tomantique et Ie reve [Marseilles, 1937], vo!' 2), to which Beguin appends the
just remark (p. 397): "Hugo transports all that he takes up-,md which could
appear pure foolishness were reason alone to judge-into his mythology, a little
like the primitive savage initiated into tlle beauties of free and compulsory public
education. But his vengeance (and his destiny as well) will be to become, himself,
the myth of an age devoid of all mythic meaning:' Hence, Hugo transported
spiritualism into his world. "Every great spirit carries on in his life two works : the
work of the living person and the work of the phantom. . . . Whereas the living
man performs the first work, the pensive phantom-at nigbt, amid the universal
silence-awakes within the m,m. 0 terror! 'W11at: says the human being, 'that is
not alI?'-'No: replies the specter. 'Get up! Up! There is a great wind abroad, the
hounds and the faxes are yelping, darkness is everywhere, and nature shudders
and trembles under the whipcord of God; . . . The writer-specter sees the phan­
tom ideas. Words take fright, sentences shiver, . . . the willdowpane grows dim,
the lamp is afraid. . . . Take care, living man, 0 man of a century, 0 proscript of
a terrestrial idea! For this is madness, this is the tomb, this is the infinite-this is a
phantom idea" (p. 390). The "great spirit;' in the same context: "He encounters
certitude sometiInes as an obstacle on his path, and clarity sOllletimes as a fear"
(p. 391) .-From Post-Scriptum de rna vie: "There exists a hilarity of shadows.
Nocturnal laughter floats in the ail: There are merry specters" (p. 396).         [dI7,4]


Hugo fanlOusly intoxicates himself-and not only in William ShaliesjJeare-with
long lists of the names of great geniuses. In this regard, one should recall the
poees passion for imagining his own nanle writ large; we know he read an H in
the towers of Notre Dame. Another aspect of the matter is disclosed by his
spiritualistic experiences. The great geniuses whose naInes he tirelessly rehearses,
always in a different order, are his " avatars," incarnations of his own ego, and the
more present for being ranged so before it.                                     [dI7a,l]


Just as, during the writing of Notre-Dame de Parl:" Hugo every evening would
visit one of the towers of the cathedral, so on Guernsey (Jersey?) he sought out
the rocher des proscrits <exiles' rock>, from which every afternoon he would con­
template the ocean.                                                             [dI7a,2]

disgusting one hy one those men endowed with breadth of vision and generosity of
heart. Each, in his turn, disenchanted with the mendacious symbols that no longer
represent them, these men are going to congregate around ideas alone . . . . It is to
help hring forth conviction, to add one voice more to this political gronp, that I
temporarily renounce my solitude." Lamartine, �"Des Destinees de la poesie" [sec­
ond preface to Les Meditations], in Les Grand Ecrivains de la France: La­
martine, vol. 2 (Paris, 1915), pp. 422-423.                                   [d18,5J

On the serial novel in Sue's day: "'The need to which these fantasies respond is that
of discovering some relation among events that appear to he utterly random. Oh­
scm'ely, the imagination persuades itself that all these inequalities of sodal exist­
enee, these downfalls and ascents, constitute one and the same great action-in
other words, that they proceed from a single cause and are eonneeted one to
another. The development of the serial novel parallels the creation of the social
scienees. " Cassou, Quarante-huit (Paris < 1939» , p. 15.                    [dI8,6]

Casson on the " demol�ratie lyricism of Lamartine": '"We discover in this a secret
thought: our possessions, along with all their train of spiritual delights, accom­
pany us to the very threshold of immortality. Hardly broached in Milly, Oll fa terre
natale, this theme hursts forth in La Vigne et ia maison, expressing Lamartine's
supreme desire-that of living on in a realm of physical immortality where every
ohject preserves its perfect and savory reality. This eschatology, no doubt, differs
a little from t.he pure spiritualism of La Mort de Soc rate, with its 'Platonic inspira­
tion . . . . But it reveals the profound nature of this aristocratil� landowner."" Jean
Cassou, Quarante-huit (Paris), p. 173.                                           [d18a,l]
The gargoyles of Notre Dame must be just about contemporary with Victor
Hugo's novel. "Here Viollet-le-Duc, . . . whose work was so sharply criticized,
has accomplished something remarkable. TI,ese devils and monsters are actually
descendants of the grotesques created in the Middle Ages by the possessed inmgi­
nation, everywhere seeing demons, really seeing them;' Fritz Stahl, Paris (Berlin
<1929» , p. 72. We meet with the analogous phenomenon, it seems, in Hugo. At
stake here, perhaps, is a question, one that coincides with the question: Why is
the nineteenth century the century of spiritualism?                       [dl8a,2]

An inlportant relation between information and feuilleton is indicated by Laver­
dant (this, at any rate, is how the signet "Lm" is read by HUllt, Le Socialisme et Ie
romantisme en France [Oxford, 1935]): "The distressing disputes . . . between Ger­
many and France, the war in Africa-do not such facts deserve as much attention
as skillfully told stories of former times or of individual misfortunes? Tills being
the case, if the public . . . reads these great national novels chapter by chapter,
why do you wish to inlpose on it, all at one time, your tale or your doctrine? . .

"Napoleon represented the last onslaught of revolutionary terror against the
bourgeois society which had been proclaimed by this same Revolution, and against
its policy. Napoleon, of course, already discerned the essence of the modern state;
he understood that it is based on the unhampered development of bourgeois soci­
ety, on the free movement of private interest, and so forth. . . . Yet, at the same
time, he still regarded the state as an end in itself and civil life only as a purse-
bearer. . . . He perfected the Terror by substituting permanent war for permanent
revolution . . . . If he despotically suppressed the liberalism of bourgeois society-
the political idealism of its daily practice-he showed no more consideration for its
essential material interests, trade and industry, whenever they conflicted with his
political interests. His scorn for industrial hommes d'affaires was the complement
to his scorn for ideologues . . . . Just as the liberal bourgeoisie was opposed once
more by revolutionary terror in the person of Napoleon, so it was opposed once
more by counterrevolution during the Restoration, in the person of the Bourhons.
Finally, in 1830, the bourgeoisie put into effect. it.s wishes of the year 1789, the only
difference being that its political enlightenment. was now complete, that it. no
longer considered the constitutional represent.ative state as a means for achieving
the ideal of the state, the welfm'e of the world, and universal human aims hut, on
the contrary, had acknowledged it as the official expression of its own exclusive
power and the political recognition of its own special interests." Karl _Marx and
_Friedrich Engels, Die heilige Familie; cited in Die neue Zeit, 3 (Stuttgart, 1885),

Guizot ministry. "'Corrupting the elect.oral colleges was a simple matter. These
colleges generally comprised few electors; many contained less than 200, among
which were government bureaucrats. The latter obeyed the orders they were
given.; as to ordinary electors � one could buy them by giving their dependents and
favorites things like tobacco shops or scholarships, or by giving the elector himself
some important administrative post. In the Chamber, as in the electoral colleges,
government bureaucrats were quite numerous: more than a third of' the deputies
(184 out of 4,59, in 18l1,6) were prefects, magistrates � officials. The minister con­
trolled them by fueling their hopes for advancement . . . . To reach a majority,
thirty or forty deputies were needed. Guizot won them with concessions for large
state projects (tIris was in the early clays of railroad construction) or hy giving
them a share of the contract for supplies to the state. Corruption was thus built up
into a system of government, and the numerous scandals at the end of the reign
make glaringly clear that the underlings worked the system just as well as the
prime minister." A. MOllet and P. Grillet, XIX" Siecle (Paris, 1919), pp. 95, 97.
Lamartine spoke, at this time, of the danger of an ��electoral aristocracy" (1847).

Some light on Napoleon's relation to the hourgeoisie around 1814. ""The empcror
had evinced the greatest reluctance at the prospect of arnring the Paris population.
Fearing the revolutionary spirit, he had refused the services of 50,000 workers,
most of them former soldiers; he had wanted to organizc companies . . . made up
solely of citizens of the haute hourgeoisie-that is to say, those who wcre inclined
to regard the allies as liberators . . . . People cursed Napoleon's name. Witness a
letter to Colonel Greiner, second in command at the Ecole . . . : 'April 1 1 , 1314.a
Cowardly slave of an equally cowardly master! Give me hack my son! Bloodthirst­
ier even than the tyrant, you have outdone him in eruelty by delivering up to
enemy fire the children we entrusted to your l�are-we who helieve in the law that
guaranteed their education. Where are they? You will answer for this with your
head! All the mothers are marching against you, and I myseU'� I promise you, will
wring your neck with my own two hands if my son does not reappear soon. '"

��Protestantism . . . did away with the saints in heaven so as to be able to abolish
their feast days on earth. The Revolution of 1789 understood still better what it
was about. The reformed religion had held on to Sunday; but for the revolution­
ary bourgeois, that one day of rest coming every seven days was too much, and
they therefore substituted for the seven-day week the ten-day week < 1a decade > ,
so that the day of rest recurred but every ten days. And in order to bury all
memory of the ecclesiastical holy days . . . , they replaced the names of saints, in
the republican calendar, with the names of metals, plants, and animals." Paul

" In the first days of the Revolution, the question of the poor assumed . . . a very
distinct and urgent character. Bailly, who initially had been elected mayor of Paris
for the express purpose of alleviating the misery of the . . . workers, packed them
into masses and cooped them up-some 18,000 people-like wild animals, on the
hill of Montmartre. Those who stormed the Bastille had workers with cannons
emplaced there, lighted match in hand . . . . Had the war not drawn the unem­
ployed and destitute laborers from town and countryside . . . into the army, and
shuttled them off to the borders, . . . a popular uprising would have spread across
the whole of France." Paul Lafargue, " Die christliche Liebestatigkeit" [Die neue

" When, around 1829, M. de Saint-Cricq, director of Customs, announced the
commercial shutdown, . . . we were incredulous. It was so serious that it caused
the July Revolution. On the eve of February 1848 � during the harsh winter that
preceded it, the shutdown returned, and with it unemployment. 1wenty years
later, in 1869, here it is again. No one has any desire for enterprise. The current
government, with its Credit Mobilier and other companies, all so advantageous to
�   the Stock Exchange, diverted for ten years the agricultural and industrial capital
that earns c01nparativeiy little interest. Its free-trade treaty, opening France to

" The social philosophy of the art of lithography at its heginnings . . . After the
image makers of the Napoleonic legend, after the literary 3rtists of Romanticism,
came the chroniclers of the daily life of the French. The first group unwittingly
paved the way for political upheavals, the second hastened the evolution of litera­
ture, and the third contributed to the profound demarcation between the aristoc­
racy and the people." Henri Bonehot, La Lithographie (Paris <1895» , pp. 112,
114.                                                                          [il,l]

Pigal portrays the people; Monnier, the petty bourgeoisie ; Lami, the aristocracy.
[il,2]

The important contribution of amateurs can be observed in the early days of
lithography, exactly as it can later in photography.                               [il,3]


" The contest between lithography and stipple-engraving accelerates from day to
day, hut, since the end of 1817, the victory has belonged to lithography, thanks to
the existence of caricature." Henri Bonchot, La Lithographie (Paris < 1895» ,
p. 50.                                                                        [il ,4]

Bouchot looks on lithographs produced before 1817 as the incunabula of lithog­
raphy. From 1818 to 1825, lithographic production in France steadily expands.
Political circumstances made this upsurge much more visible there than in other
countries. Its decline, too, is in part conditioned by politics: it coincides with the
rise of Napoleon I I I. "-n,e fact is . . . that, of the illustrious number present under
the reign of Louis Philippe, there remained, in the early years of Napoleon III,
barely four or five exhausted, disoriented survivors." Henri Bouchot, La Lit1lOg­
mphie (Paris), p. 182.                                                             [iI ,S]

Lithography toward the end of the Second Empire: �"So many things worked
against it! The newly revived etching, the nascent heliographic processes, and to
some extent the burin. Materially, it foundered under the difficulties associated
with printing-the encumbrance of those very heavy stones, which the editors
refused to warehouse as before." Henri Bonchot, La Lithographie (Paris), p. 193.

1835-184.5: "It should . . . not be forgotten that the large-scale commercial opera­         •.



tion which, at that time, was underway in wood engraving very quickly . . . led to
mass-production techniques. A woodcutter would make only the heads or figures
in a work, while another less skilled, or an apprentice, would make the accesso­

The first attempt at introducing lithography into France, undertaken by Sene­
felder's associate Andre d'Offenbach, was a complete failure. ""He had . . . moved
to France solely with the intention of selling musical scores printed by means of
lithography. The patent had been taken out in his name in 1802, and he had
opened a shop, . . . little suspecting . . . what was in store for the discovery. . . . As
a matter of fact, it was not an auspicious moment for the minor arts of transcrip­
tion. The master David expressed only the haughtiest disdain for engraving; at
most, he had a few kind words for the copper-plate technique. Andre's enterprise
was very soon in jeopardy." Henri Bouchot, La Lithographie (Paris < 1895» ,

[The Commune]




"The history of the Paris Commune has hecome a touchstone of great importance
for the question: How should the revolutionary working class organize its tactics
and strategy in order to achieve ultimate victory? With the fall of the Commune,
the last traditions of the old revolutionary legend have lilmwise fallen forever; no
favorable tUrll of circumstances, no heroic spirit, no martyrdom CHn take the
place of the proletariat's clear insight into . . . the indispensable conditions of its
emancipation. What holds for the revolutions that were carried out hy minorities,
and in the interests of minorities, no longer holds for the proletarian revolu­
tion . . . . In the history of the Commune, the germs of this revolution were effec­
tively stifled by the creeping plants that, growing out of the bourgeois revolution of
the eighteenth centurYl overran the revolutionary workers' movement of the nine­
teenth century. Missing in the Commune were the firm organization of the prole­
tariat as a class and the fundamental clarity as to its world-historical mission; on
these grounds alone it had to succum}). " [F. Mehringl] '"Zum Gedachtnis del' Par­
iseI' Kommune," Die neue Zeit, 14, no. 1 (Stuttgart, 1896), pp. 739-740.         [kl,l]


" We ·wiH say hut two words about the lecture-presentations that have multiplied in
reoent years . . . . M. Ballande, who first thought of devoting Sunday afternoons to
the inexpensive performance of masterpieces or the exhibition of certain monu­
ments of art, preceded hy a historical and literary explication of the work, had hit
upon a happy and rewarding idea . . . . But success breeds imitation, and it is rare
that the imitations do not bring out the trouhlesome aspects of the things they
copy. This is indeed what happened. Daily presentations were organized at the
Chatclet and the Ambigu. In these performances, questions of artistry were rele­
gated to a position of secondary importance; politics predominated. Someone
fetched up Agnes de Meranie; another exhumed Calas and Charles IX, ou L 'Ecole
des rois . ' . . . From here, things could only go downhill; the most benign of works,
by a strange inflection of the political madness, provided material . . . for the most
heterogeneous declamations on the affairs of the day. Moliere and Louis XIV
would certainly have heen surprised, Ht times, by the attacks . . . for which they
served as pretexts. This type of 'theatrical' presentation completely defied all
control. "-I.'When revolutions break out, one often hears admissions that can be
highly instructive. Here is what was said in Le Mot d'ordre of May 17, 1871, on the
subject of the citizenship cards:2 'The overly assiduous reading of Le Chevalier de
Maison-Rouge and other novels hy Alexandre Dumas certainly inspired the mem­
bers of the Commune to come up with this decree. We regret having to inform them
that history is not made hy reading novels. Victor Hallays-Dahot, La Censu.re

"At several intersections, our path opened out unexpectedly into vast arched
domes . . . . Surely, each of these clandestine colosseums would provide a useful
stronghold for the concentration of forces in certain eventualities, just as the
infinity of subterranean networks, with its thousand galleries running under every
corner of the capital, provides a ready-made sap from which to attack the city
from helow. . . . The lightning bolt that annihilated the Empire did not leave it
time to act on this conception. It is harder to figure out why the leaders of the
Commune, . . . so resolute in everything, did not make use of this formidahle
means of destruction when faced with the appearance of troops. " Nadal', Qltand

';'If Rimbaud is in fact admirable, it is not for having fallen silent but for having
spoken. If he fell silent, it. was douhtless for lack of a true audience. It was hecause
the societ.y in which he lived could not offer him t.his audience. One ought. to keep
in mind the very simple fact that Arthur Rimhaud came to Paris in 1871, quite
naturally, to join the army of the Commune . . . . In the barracks of the Chatcau­

"The Commune, which accorded seats only to those elected from the workers'
districts, was formed of a coalition of revolutionaries without a common program.
Of the seventy-eight members, only a score were intent on projects of social re­

Within the Commune emerged the project of a Monument to the Accursed, which
was supposed to be raised in the corner of a public square whose center would be
occupied by a war memorial. All the official personalities of the Second Empire
(according to the draft of the project) were to be listed on it. Even Haussmann's
name is there. In this way, an "infernal history" of the regime was to be launched,
although the intention was to go back to Napoleon I, "the villain of Brumaire-the
chief of this accursed race of crowned bohemians vomited forth to us by Corsica,
this fatal line of bastards so degenerated they would be lost in their own native
land." The project, in the form of a printed placard, is dated April 1 5, 1871.

In France's First Empire � and especially its Second � Engels sees states that could

The desperate struggle of the Commune: <'"Delescluze then issued his famous proc­
lamation: 'Enough of this militarism! No more of these officers dripping gold hraid
and emhroidery! Make way for the people, for hare-armed fighters! The hour of
revolution has struck . . . . ' An impatient enthusiasm awakes in all hearts, and one
will go off to get oneself killed, as the Polish strategists intend>; Each man will
return to his neighborhood, his native turf, to the streetcorner where it is good to
live and. bravely die-the traditional barricade! This proclamation is the last cry
of Blanquism, the supreme leap of the nineteenth century. One still wants to be­
lieve. To believe in the mystery, the miracle, the feuilleton, the magic power of the
epic. One has not yet understood that the other class has organized itself scien­
tifically, has entrusted itself to implacable armies. Its leaders have long since ac­
quired a clear vision of the situation. Not for nothing had Haussmann built broad,
perfectly straight avenues to break up the swarming � tortuous neighborhoods, the
breeding grounds for mystery and for the feuilleton, the secret gardens of popular
conspiracy." Jean Cassou, " La Semaine sanglante," Vendredi, May 22, 1936.

Engels and the Commune: " As long as the central committee of the Garde Nation­
ale was directing the military operations, he remained hopeful. It was doubtless he
who gave the advice which Marx transmitted to Paris: 'to fortify the northern
slopes of Montmartre, the Prussian side . ' He feared that, othenvise, the uprising
�would land in a mousetrap.' But the Commune failed to heed tIns warning and, as
Engels regretfully confirmed, let the right moment for the offensive slip past. . . .
Initially, Engels believed that the struggle would drag on . . . . In the General
Council, he emphasized . . . that the Parisian workers were better organized mili­
tarily than in any earlier rebellion; that the street widening undertaken during the
administration of Napoleon HI would necessarily work to their advantage, should
the assault on the city succeed; that for the first time, the harricades would be
defended by cannons and regularly organized troops. " Gustav Mayer, Friedrich
Engels, vol. 2 , Engels und dm' Au/stieg der Arbeiterbewegung in Europa (Berlin
< 1933» , p. 227."                                                             [k3,2]

In 1884, Engels " admitted to Bernstein that Marx 'had upgraded the unconscious
tendencies of the Commune into more or less conscious proj eets,' and he added
that this improvement had been 'justified, even necessary, in the circumstances. '
, . . The majority of the participants in the uprising had heen Blanquists-that is
to say, nationalistic revolutionaries who placed their hopes on immediate political
action and the authoritarian dictatorship of a few resolute individuals. Only a
minority had belonged to the <First> International, which at that time was still
dominated by the spirit of Proudhon, and they could therefore not he deserihcd as
social revolutionaries, let alone Marxists. That did not prevent the governments
and thc bourgeoisie tht'oughout Europe from regarding this insurrection . . . as a
conspiracy hatched by the Gcncral Council of the International. " Gustav Maycr,

The first communio: the city. " The German emperors-Frederick I and Frederick

rationes, . . . quite in the spirit of the German Federal Diet. . . , It is quite amusing
that the word comnuutio was used as a term of ahuse, just as 'communism' is
today. The parson Guibert of Nogent writes, for instance: 'Col1unu.nio is a new and
cxtremely had word, ' There is frequently something rather dramatic about the
way in which the philistines of the twelfth century invite the pc as ants to flee to the

On the " nets of Saint-Cloud" we have the testimony of Mercier (Tableau. de Paris

nets of Saint-Cloud." There are many, such as Dulaure, who speak of these nets;
others, like Gozlan and Touchard-Lafosse, deny they ever existed. The archives of
the Seine make no mention of them. Tradition maintains that they stopped being
used in 1810. This according to Firmin Maillard, Recherches historiques et cri­

[Idleness]




Noteworthy conjunction: in ancient Greece, practical labor is branded and pro­
scribed. Although essentially left in the hands of slaves, it is condemned not least
because it betrays a base aspiration for earthly goods (riches). This view after­
ward plays a part in the denigration of the tradesman as the servant ofMannnon:
"Plato, in the Laws (VIII, 846), decrees that no citizen shall engage in a mechani­
cal trade; the word banausoJ) signifying 'artisan; becomes synonymous with 'con­
temptible' . . . ; everything relating to tradespeople or to handwork carries a
stigma, and deforms the soul together with the body. In general, those who
practice these professions . . . are busy satisfying . . . this 'passion for wealth . . .
which leaves none of us an hour's leisure:' Aristotle, for his part, opposes the
excess of the chrematistic to . . . the prudence of domestic economy. . . . In this
way, the scorn felt for the artisan is extended to the merchant: in comparison to
the liberal life, as absorbed in studious leisure (schole, olium), the affairs of trade
(neg-ot£um, ascholia}) 'business affairs; have mostly a negative value." Pierre­
Maxime Schulll, Machinisme el philosophie (Paris, 1938), pp. 11-12.              [m1 , 1]


Whoever enjoys leisure escapes Fortuna; whoever embraces idleness falls under
her power. The Fortuna awaiting a person in idleness, however, is a lesser god­
dess than the one that the person of leisure has fled. TI,is Fortuna is no longer at
home in the vila activa; her headquarters is the world at large.' "The artists of the
Middle Ages depict those men who pursue an active life as bound to the wheel of
fortune, ascending or descending according to the direction in which it turns,
while the contemplative man remains inunobile at the center." P.-M. Schuhl,

In bourgeois society, indolence-to take up Marx's word-has ceased to be
"heroic." (Marx speaks of the "victory . . . of industry over a heroic indolence."

In the figure of the dandy, Baudelaire seeks to find some use for idleness, just as
leisure once had a use. The vita contemplativa is replaced by something that could
be called the vita contemptiva. (Compare part 3 of my manuscript <"Das Paris des
Second Empire bei Baudelaire">.)                                             [mla,2]

Experience is the outcome of work; immediate experience is the phantasmagoria
of the idler."                                                               [mla,3]

In place of the force field that is lost to humanity with the devaluation of experi­
ence, a new field of force opens up in the form of planning. The mass of un­
known uniformities is mobilized against the confirmed multiplicity of the
traditional. To "plan" is henceforth possible only on a large scale. No longer on
an individual scale-and this means neitherfir the individual nor by the individ­
ual. Valery therefore says, with reason: "The long-hatched enterprises, the pro­
found designs of a Machiavelli or a Richelieu, would today have the reliability
and value of a good tip on the Stock Exchange." Paul Valery, Oeuvres completes,
J « Paris, 1938), p. 30>.                                                    [mla,4]

The intentional correlate of "immediate experience)) has not always remained the
same. In the nineteenth century, it was ('adventure!' In our day, it appears as
"fate;' Schicksal. In fate is concealed the concept of the "total experience" that is
fatal from the outset. War is its unsurpassed prefiguration. ("I am born German;
it is for this I die"-the trauma of birth already contains the shock that is mortal.
This coincidence <Koinzidenz> defines "fate:')                               [mla,S]

Would it be empathy with exchange value that first qualifies the human being for
a "total experience"?                                                        [mla,6]

With the trace <Spur>, a new dimension accrues to "irnmediate experience." It is
no longer tied to the expectation of " adventure"; the one who undergoes an
experience can follow the trace that leads there. Whoever follows traces must not
only pay attention; above all, he must have given heed already to a great many
things. (The hunter must know about the hoof of the animal whose trail he is on;
he must know the hour when that animal goes to drink; he must know the course
of the river to which it tums, and the location of the ford by which he himself can
get across.) In this way there comes into play the peculiar configuration by dint of
which long experience appears translated into the language of immediate experi­
ence.5 Experiences can, in fact, prove invaluable to one who follows a trace-but
experieuces of a particular sort. The hunt is the one type of work in which they
function intrinsically. And the hunt is, as work, very primitive. The experiences
<Erfohrungen> of one who attends to a trace result only very remotely from any
work activity, or are cut off from such a procedure altogether. (Not for nothing do
we speak of "fortune hunting.") They have no sequence and no system. They are
a product of chance, and have about them the essential interminability that
distinguishes the preferred obligations of the idler. The fWldamentally unfinish­
able collection of things worth knowing, whose utility depends on chance, has its
prototype in study.                                                       [m2,1]

Idleness has little about it that is representative, though it is far more widely
exhibited than leisure.The man of the middle class has begun to be ashamed of
labor. He to whom leisure no longer means anything in itself is happy to put his
idleness on display.                                                        [m2,2]

The intimate association between the concept of idleness and the concept of
study was emboclied in the notion of studio. Especially for the bachelor, the studio
becanle a sort of pendant to the boudoir.                                    [m2,3]

There are two social institutions of which idleness forms an integral part: tl,e
news service and nightlife. They require a specific form of work-preparedness.
This specific form is idleness.                                        [m2a,2]

News service and idleness.Feuilletonist, reporter, photographer constitute a gra­
dation in which waiting around, the "Get ready" succeeded by the "Shoot;'
becomes ever more important vis-a.-vis other activities.                 [m2a,3J

What distinguishes long experience from immediate experience is that the for­
mer is inseparable from the representation of a eontinnity, a sequence. TI,e
accent that falls on inlillediate experience will be the more weighty in proportion
as its substrate is remote from the work of the one having the experience-from
the work distinguished by the fact that it draws on long experience precisely
where, for an outsider, it is at most an inullediate experience that arises. [m2a,4]

In feudal society, leisure-freedom from labor-was a recognized privilege. In
bourgeois society, it is no longer so. What distinguishes leisure, as feudalism
understands it, is that it communicates with two socially important types of
behavior. Religious contemplation and court life represented, as it were, the
matrices through which the leisure of the grand seigneur, of the prelate, of the
warrior could be molded. These attitudes-that of piety no less than that of
representation-were advantageous to the poet. His work in tum benefited
them, at !east indirectly, insofar as it maintained contact with both the religion
and the life at court. (Voltaire was the first of the great literati to break with the
church; so much the less did he disdain to secure a place at the court of Frederick
the Great.) In feudal society, the leisure of the poet is a recognized privilege. It is
only in bourgeois society that the poet becomes an idler.                      [m2a,5]
Idleness seeks to avoid any sort of tie to the idler's line of work, and ultimately to
the labor process in general. That distinguishes it from leisure.                [m3,!]

Closely connected with the shattering of long experience is the shattering of
juridical certitudes. "In the liberalist period, economic predominance was gener­
ally associated with legal ownership of the means of production . . . . But after the
development of technology in the last century had led to a rapidly increasing
concentration . . . of capital, the legal owners were largely excluded from . . .
management. . . . Once the legal owners are cut off from the real productive
process . . . , their horizon narrows; . . . and finally the share which they still have
in industry due to ownership . . . comes to seem socially useless . . . . The idea of
a right with a fixed content, and independent of society at large, loses its impor­
tance." We finally arrive at "the loss of all rights with a determined content, a loss

Apropos of the idler: the archaic image of ships in Baudelaire.                  [m3,S]


The stringent work ethic and moral doctrine of Calvinism, it may be said, is most
intimately related to the development of the vita contemplativa. It sought to build
a dam to stem the melting of time into idleness, once such time was frozen in
contemplation.                                                                  [m3a,!]


On the feuilleton. It was a matter of injecting experience-as it were, intrave­
nously-with the poison of sensation; that is to say, highlighting within ordinary
experience the character of immediate experience.7 To this end, the experience of
the big-city dweller presented itself. The feuilletonist turns this to account. He
renders the city strange to its inhabitants. He is thus one of the first technicians
called up by the heightened need for immediate expel�ences. (The same need is
evinced in the theory of "modern beauty" expounded by Poe, Baudelaire, and
Berlioz. In this type of beauty, surprise is a ruling element.)    [m3a,2]

"TI,e process of the atropby of experience is already underway within manufac­
turing. In other words, it coincides, in its begillllings, with the begill11ings of
connnodity production. (Compare Marx, Das Kapital <vol. 1>, ed. Korsch <Ber­
lin, 1932>, p. 336.)8                                                        [m3a,3]

Phantasmagoria is the intentional correlate of innnediate experience.          [m3a,4]

Just as the industrial labor process separates off from handicraft, so the form of
communication corresponding to this labor process-information-separates off
from the forru of communication corresponding to the artisanal process of labor,
which is storytelling. (See <Walter Benjamin,> "Der Erzahler;' < Orient und Occi­
dent, new series, no. 3 (October 1936» p. 21, par. 3 through p. 22, par. 1, line 3;
p. 22, par. 3, line 1 through the end of the Valery citation.)" This cOll11ection must
be kept in mind if one is to form an idea of the explosive force contained within
information. lbis force is liberated in sensation. With the sensation, whatever
still resembles wisdom, oral tradition, or the epic side of truth is razed to the
ground.                                                                         [m3a,S]

For the relations which the idler loves to enter into with the demimonde, "study"
is an alibi. It may be asserted of the boheme, in particular, that throughout its
existence it studies its own milieu.                                       [m3a,6]

Idleness can be considered an early form of distraction or amusement. It consists
in the readiness to savoy, on one's own, an arbitrary succession of sensations. But
as soon as the production process began to draw large masses of people into the
field, those who "had the time" came to feel a need to distinguish themselves en
masse from laborers. It was to this need that the entertainment industry an­
swered; and it inlmediately encountered specific problems of its own. Before very
long, Saint-Marc Girardin was forced to conclude that "man is amusable only a
small part of the time." (The idler does not tire as quickly as the man who amuses
llinlself.)                                                                  [m4,1]

"Empathy" comes into being through a dedic, a kind of gearing action. With it,

God has the Creation behind him; he rests from it. It is this God of the seventh
day that the bourgeois has taken as the model for his idleness. In fl&nerie, he has
the omnipresence of God; in gambling, the omnipotence; and in study, it is God's
omniscience that is his.-Tills trinity is at the origin of the satanism in Baude­
laire.-The idler's resemblance to God indicates that the old Protestant saying,
"Work is the burgher's ornament;' has begun to lose its validity.             [m4,6]

The world exhibitions were training schools in which the masses, barred from
consuming, learned empathy with exchange value. "Look at everything; touch
nothing;'                                                                     [m4,7]

The classic description of idleness in Rousseau. Tills passage indicates, at one
and the same time, that the existence of the idler has something godlike about it,
and that solitude is a condition essential to the idler. In the last book of Les
Confissions, we read that "the age for romantic plans was past. I had found the
incense of vainglory stupefying rather than flattering. So the last hope I had left
was to live . . . eternally at leisure. Such is the life of the blessed in the other
world, and henceforth I thought of it as my supreme felicity in this. I 11,ose who
reproach me for my many inconsistencies will not fail to reproach me for this
one, too. I have said that the idleness of society made it unbearable to me; and
here I am, seeking for solitude solely in order to give myself up to idleness . . . .
The idleness of society is deadly because it is obligatory; the idleness of solitude
is delightful because it is free and voluntary;' JeanJacques Rousseau, Les Confis­
sions, ed. Hilsum (Paris <1931» , vo!' 4, p. 173."                           [m4a,1]

Among the conditions of idleness, particular importance attaches to solitude. It is
solitude, in fact, that first emancipates-virtually-individual experience from
every event, however trivial or inlpoverished: it offers to the individual experi­
ence, on the high road of empathy, any passerby whatsoever as its substrate.
Empathy is possible only to the solitary; solitude, therefore, is a precondition of
authentic idleness.                                                          [m4a,2]

When all lines are broken and no sail appears on the blank horizon, when no
wave of imnlcdiate experience surges and crests, then there remains to the iso­
lated subject in the grip of taedium vitae one last thing-and that is empathy.
[m4a,3]

We may leave the question undecided as to whether, and in what sense, leisure is
also determined by the order of production which makes it possible. We should,
however, try to show how deeply idleness is marked by features of the capitalist
economic order in which it flourishes. -On the other side, idleness, in the bour­
geois society that knows no leisure, is a precondition of artistic production. And,
""
o    often, idleness is the very thing which stamps that production with the traits that
00
make its relation to the economic production process so drastic.           [m4a,4]

The student "never stops learning" ; the gambler "never has enough"; for the
flaneur, "there is always something more to see," Idleness has in view an unlim­
ited duration, which fundamentally distinguishes it from simple sensuous pleas­
ure, of whatever variety. (Is it correct to say that the "bad infinity" that prevails in
idleness appears in Hegel as the signature of bourgeois society?)                [m5, 1]

The spontaneity common to the student, to the gambler, to the flaneur is perhaps
that of the hunter-which is to say, that of the oldest type of work, which may be
intertwined closest of all with idleness.                                   [m5,2]

Flaubert's "Few will suspect how depressed one had to be to undertake the
revival of Carthage" makes the connection between study and melencolia <sic>
transparent. (The latter no doubt threatens not only this form of leisure but all
forms of idleness.) Compare "My soul is sad and I have read all the books"
(Mallarme) ; "Spleen II" and "La Voix" (Baudelaire) ; "Here stand I, alas, Philoso­
phy / behind me" (Goethe) Y                                                  [m5,3]

Again and again in Baudelaire, the specifically modem is there to be recognized
as complement of the specifically archaic. In the person of the flaneur, whose
idleness carries him through an imaginary city of arcades, the poet is confronted
by the dandy (who weaves his way through the crowd without taking notice of
the jolts to which he is exposed) . Yet also in the flaneur a long-extinct creature
opens a dreamy eye, casts a look that goes to the heart of the poet. It is the "son
of the wildemess"-the man who, once upon a time, was betrothed, by a gener­
ous nature, to leisure. Dandyism is the last glinuner of the heroic in times of
decadence. Baudelaire is delighted to find in Chateaubriand a reference to Ameri­
can Indian dandies-testimony to the fonner golden age of these tribes. [m5,4]

On the hunter type in the Hauenr: '"The mass of tenants and lodgers begins to stray
from shelter to shelter in this sea of houses, like the hunters and shepherds of
prehistory. The intellectual education of the nomad is now complete." Oswald

produced in 32mo format suitable to be sold . . . to those out walking or driving, is
represented in 1836, in the Bibliographie de la France, by two volumes; in 1838
there are eight volumes listed; in 184,1 there are seventy-six; in 1842 � forty-four;
fifteen the year following; and hardly more than t.hree or four in the two years
since then. From the physiology of individuals , one moved to the physiology of
cities. There was Paris la nuit; Paris a table; Paris dans { 'eall; Paris a cheval;
Paris pittoresque; Paris bohfm-den; Paris litteraire; Paris 11ta.rie. Then came the
physiology of peoples: Les Fraru;ais; Les Anglais peints par eux-11til!nes . These
were followed by the physiology of animals: Les Animaux peints par eux-memes et

Rise of the physiologies: !.I.The burning political struggle of the years 1830-1835

out, politically speaking, by the September Laws. At a time, that is, when they had
fathomed aU the secrets of their art, they were suddenly restricted to a single
theater of operations: the description of bourgeois life . . . . This is the circum­
stance that explains the colossal revue of bourgeois life inaugurated around the
middle of the 1830s in France . . . . Everything came into the picture: . . . happy
days and sad days, work and recreation, marriage customs and bachelor habits,
family, house, child, school, society, theater, types, professions." Eduard Fuchs,

What sordidness once again, at the end of the century, in the representation of
physiological affairs! Characteristic of this is a description of impotence in Mail­
lard's book on the history of women's emancipation, which in its overall han­
dling of the matter lays bare, in drastic fashion, the reaction of the established
bourgeoisie to anthropological materialism. In connection with the presentation
of Claire Demar's doctrine, one finds that "she . . . speaks of the deceptions that
can result from that strange and enonnous sacrifice, at the risk of which, under a
torrid Italian sky, more than one young man tries his luck at becoming a famous
chanteur." Firmin Maillard, La Legende de fafimme emancipee (Paris), p. 98.

A key passage from the manifesto of Claire Demar: '!.The union of the sexes in the
future will have to be the result of . . . deeply meditated sympathies . . . ; this will
he the case even where the existence of an intimate, secret, and mysterious rapport
between two souls has been recognized . . . . All such relations could very well come
to nothing in the face of one last, indispensable, and decisive test: the TEST of
MATTER by MATTER, the ASSAY of FLESH by FLESH ! ! !  •   •Often enough, on the very
.
;::   threshold of the hedroom, a devouring flame has come to be extinguished; often
'"
enough, for more than one grand passion, the perfumed bedsheets have become a
death shroud, More than one person . . . who will read these lines has entered, at
night, into the bed of Hymen, palpitating with desires and emotions, only to
awaken in the morning cold and icy." Claire Demar, Ma Loi d'avenir (Paris,
1834), 1'1', 36-37.                                                         [p2,5]

Re anthropological materialism. Conclusion of Claire Demar's Ma Loi d 'avenir
<My Law of the Future > : "No more motherhood, no more law of blood, I say: no
more motherhood. And, in fact, the woman emancipated . . . from the man, who
then no longer pays her the price of her body, . . . will owe her existence . , . to her
works alone. }l"or this it is necessary that the woman pursue some work, fulfill a
function, And how can she do this if she is always condemned to give up a more or
less large part of her life to the care and education of one or more children'? . . .
You want to emancipate the woman? Well, then, take the newborn child from the
breast of the blood-mother and give it into the arms of the social mother, a nurse
employed by the state, and the child will be better raised. . . . Then, and then only,
will man, woman, and child be freed from the law of blood, from the exploitation
of humanity by humanity. " Claire Demar, Ma Loi d'avenir: Ouvrage posthume
pnblie par Snzanne (Paris, 1834), 1'1'. 58-59.                                   [p2a,11

��What! Because a woman would rather not take the public into her confidence
concerning her feelings as a woman; hecause, from among all the men who would
lavish their attentions upon her, . . . only she could say which one she prefers­
. . . is she then . . . to become . . , the slave of one man? . . . What! In such cases a
woman is exploited. . . . For if she were not afraid of seeing them tear themselves to
pieces, . . . she could give satisfaction to several men at once in their love, . . . I
believe, with M. James de Laurence, in the need . . . for a freedom without . . ,
limits , . . . a freedom founded on mystery, which for me is the basis of the new
morality." Claire Demar, Ma Loi d'avenir (Paris, 1834), pp. 31-32.                [p2a,2]

The demand for "mystery"-as opposed to "publicity"-in sexual relations is
closely cOlmected, in Demar, with the demand for more or less extended trial
periods. Of course, the traditional fonn of marriage would in general be sup'
planted by this more flexible fonn. It is logical, furthermore, that these concep'
tions should give rise to the demand for matriarchy.                             [p2a,3]

From the arguments directed against patriarchy: ��Ah, it is with a huge pile of
parricidal daggers at my side that, amid widespread groans of lamentation at the
very mention of the words �father' and �mother: I venture to raise my voice . . .
against the law of hlood, the law of generation!" Claire Demar� Ma Loi d'avenir

Caricature plays a considerable role in the development of the caption. It is

Several passages from ChOre Demar's work Ma Loi d'avenir may be cited by way
of characterizing her relation to James de Laurence. The first comes from the
foreword written by Suzanne and has its point of departure in Claire Demar's
refusal to contribute to La Tribune des jhnmes: "Up until the seventeenth issue,
she had consistently refused, saying that the tone of this periodical was too
moderate. . . . When this issue appeared, there was a passage in an article by me
which, by its fonn and its moderation, exasperated Claire.-She wrote to me that
she was going to respond to it.-But . . . her response became a pamphlet, which
she then decided to publish on its own, outside the framework of the peri·
odical. . . . Here, then, is the fragment of the article of which Claire has cited only
a few lines. 'There is still in the world a man who interprets . . . Christianity . . . in
a nlanner . . . favorable to our sex: I mean M. James de Laurence, the author of a
pamphlet entitled Les Enfonts de dieu, ou La Religion de }lfsus. . . . The author is
no Saint·SinlOnian; . . . he postulates . . . an inheritance through the mother.
Certainly this system . . . is highly advantageous to us; I am convinced that some
part of it will have a place . . . in the religion of the future, and that the principle
of motherhood will become one of the fundamental laws of the state'" (Claire
Demar, Ma loi d'avenir: Ouvrage posthume pub/itpar Suzanne [paris, 1834], pp. 14-
16). In the text of her manifesto, Claire Demar makes common cause with
Laurence against the reproaches leveled at him by La Tribune desfimmes, which
had clainled that he was advocating a form of "moral liberty . . . without rules or
boundaries;' something "which . . . would surely land us in a coarse and disgust·
ing disorder!' The blame for this is said to reside in the fact that in these things
Laurence propounds mystery as a principle; on the strength of such mystery, we
would have to render account in these things to a mystical God alone. La Tribune
des Femmes, on the contrary, believes that "the Society of the Future will be
founded not on mystery but on trust; for mystery merely prolongs the exploita·
tion of our sex!' Claire Demar replies: "Certainly, Mesdames, if, like you, I
confused trust with publicity, and considered mystery as prolonging the exploita·
tion of our sex, I would be bound to give my blessings to the times in which we
live!' She goes on to describe the brutality of the customs of these times: "Before
the mayor and before the priest, . . . a man and a woman have assembled a long
train of witnesses . . . . Voila! . . . The union is called legitimate, and the woman
may now without blushing affirm: 'On such and such a day, at such and such an
hour, I shall receive a nlan into my WOMAN'S BED!!/' . . . Contracted in the presence
of the crowd, the marriage drags along, across an orgy of wines and dances,
toward the nuptial bed, which has become the bed of debauchery and prostitu·
tion, inviting the delirious imagination of the guests to follow . . . all the details
. . . of the lubricious drama enacted in the name of the Wedding Day! If the
practice which thus converts a young bride . . . into the object of impudent
glances . . . , and which prostitutes her to unrestrained desires, . . . does not
appear to you a horrible exploitation, . . . then I know not what to say" (Ma Loi
d'avenir, pp. 29-30).                                                               [p3 , 1]

Maxims from James de Laurence, Les El�fants de dieu, ou La Religion de JeSu.s
reconciliee avec la philosophie (Paris, June 1831): ��It is more reasonahle to claim
that all children are made hy God than to say that all married couplcs are joined
together hy God" (p. 14.). The fact that Jesus does not condemn the woman taken
in adultery leads Laurence to conclude that hc did not approve of marriage: ��He
pardoned her hecause he considered adultery the natural consequence of mar­
riage, and he would have accepted it were it to he found among his disciples . . . .
As long as marriage exists, an adulterous woman will be found criminal because
she hurdens her hushand with the children of others. Jesus could not tolerate such
an injustice; his system is logical: he wanted children to belong to the mother.
Whence those remarkable words: �Can no man your father on earth, for you have
one Father, who is in heavenm:1 (p. 13). "'The children of God, as descended from
one woman, form a single family. . . . The religion of the Jews was that of pater­
nity, under which the patriarchs exercised their domestic authority. The religion
of Jesus is that of maternity, whose symhol is a mother holding a child in her arms;
and this mot.her is called the Virgin hecause, while fulfilling the duties of a mother,
she had not renounced the independence of a virgin" (pp. 13-14.).                [p3a)3]

had established the community of women." James de Laurence, Les Enfants de

the past few years have reached the final stage of the old civilization; the rapid
increase in crimes, robberies, and murders is their protest against the old social
organization. At night the streets are unsafe, the bourgeois are beaten up, knifed,
and rohbed. If the local proletarians develop according to the same laws as the
English proletarians, they will soon realize that it is useless to protest against the
social system in this manner . . . and will protest in their general capacity, as
human beings, by means of communism." Engels to Marx, October 1844., from

One of the later sectarian developments of the nineteenth century is the fusionist
religion. It was propagated by L. J. B. Tourei! (born in Year VIII, died 1863 [or
1868?]). The FOUl�erist influence can be felt in his periodization of history; from
Saint·Simon comes the idea of the Trinity as a unity of Mother·Father to which
Sister·Brother or Androgyne is joined. TI,e universal substance is determined in
its working by three processes, in the definition of which the inferior basis of this
doctrine comes to light. These processes are: "Emanation, . . . the property which
the universal substance possesses of expanding infinitely beyond itself; . . . Ab·
sorption, . . . the property which the universal substance possesses of turning
back infinitely upon itself; . . . Assimilation, . . . the property which the universal
substance possesses of being intimately pemleated with itself" (p. i).-A charac·
teristic passage from the aphorism "Pauvres, riches" <Rich Men, Poor Men>,
which addresses itself to the rich and speaks of the poor: "Moreover, if you refuse
to elevate them to your level and scorn to involve yourselves with them, why
then do you breathe the same air, inhabit the same atmosphere? In order not to
breathe in and assimilate their emanation . . . , it will be necessary for you to
leave this world, to breathe a different air and live in a different atmosphere"
(p. 267).-The dead are "multiform" and exist in many places on the earth at the
same time. For this reason1 people must very seriously coneenl thenlselves, dur�
ing their lifetime, with the betterment of the earth (p. 307). Ultimately, all unites
in a series of suns, which in the end, after they have passed through the station of
one light (unilumiere), realize the "universal light" in the "universalizing region:'

If, by chance, his ear should catch some sharp noise coming from a distant
manufacturing plant, or even the monotonous churning of a factory mill, then his
countenance immediately brightens ; he no longer notices the birdsongs or the
perfumes. The thick smoke escaping from the factory's high chinmey, the ringing
of the anvil, make him tremble withjoy. These things remind him of the good aIel

which had become attentive; he would simply pronounce the words, "Two hun­

into the street. At that very instant, one could see stepping forth from the walls

Michelet on the Ecole Polytechnique and the Ecole Normale: r.'Mter those great
trials, there seemed to be a moment of silence for all human passions; one might
have thought that there was no longer any pride, self-interest, or envy. The leading
men in the state and in science accepted the most humhle positions of puhlic
instruction. Lagrange and Laplace taught arithmetic. Fifteen hundred students­
grown men who were in some cases already famous-came . . . to take their seats
at the Ecole Normale and to learn to teach. They came as best they could, in the
depth of winter� at that time of poverty and famine . . . . A great citizen, Carnot,
. . . was the real founder of the Ecole Polytechnique. They learned with the zeal of
soldiers . . . . Watching the uninterrupted inventions of their teachers, the students
went on to invent as well. Imagine the spectacle of a Lagrange who suddenly
stopped short in the middle of his lecture and was lost in thought. The room waited
in silence. Finally he awoke and told t.hem of his glowing new discovery� harely
formed in his mind. . . . What a decline after t.hose days! . . . After the reports
made to the Convention � read those of Fourcroy and }l'ontanes; you sink . . . from
manhood to old age." J . Michelet, Le Peuple (Paris, 1846), PI'. 336-338.' [1'2a,l]

Ch. F. Vie!, as an adversary of engineering constmction, no less than as a royal­
ist, was necessarily also an adversary of the Ecole Polytechnique. He laments the
decline of architecture as art-a decline "that began with that terrible period when
the throne of our king was toppled;' Charles-Fran�ois Vie!, De la Clzute im.m.inente
de la science de la construction des bdtirnens en France, vol. 1 (paris, 1 818), p. 53. The
study of architecture as art is, according to him, more difficult than the mathe­
matical theory of construction; as proof, he cites the many prizes won in tlus field
by students of the Ecole Polytechnique. The author speaks contemptuously of
the new educational arrangements-"these new institutions professing everything
with everything e!se"-and he writes on the same page: "Let us pay homage here
to the govermnent that has judged so well of the difference between mathematics
and arclutecture, and which has preserved the special school in Paris for the
teaching of this art, and recreated the private boarding school of Rome;' Charles­
Fran�ois Vie!, De 11rnpuissance des rnatlzimatiques pour assurer la soliditl des bilti­
mens (paris, 1805), p. 63. Vie! emphasizes (ibid., pp. 31-32) the irrational element
in tl1e genuine study of arclutect1lre: "The forms preexist the constmction and
constitute essentially the theory of the art of building;' In 1819 (De la Clzute      .   .   .,
vol. 2, p. 120), he is still denouncing "the attitude of the century toward the fine
arts in general, which it puts in a class with the industrial arts."                [r2a,3]

From the tme of Napoleon I, tile Ecole Polytechluque was subject to continual
reproach for providing practical training with an overly broad theoretical founda­
tion. These criticisms led, in 1855, to proposals for refoml, against which Arago
took a most determined stand. At tl1e same tme, he disnlissed the charge tl1at the
school had become a breeding ground of revolutionary animus: "I have been
told of a reproam directed against polytechnical instruction, and according to
which tile matllematical disciplines-the study of differential calculus and of
integral calculus, for example-would have the effect of transfornling their stu­
dents into socialists of the worst stamp . . . . How has it escaped the author of such
a reproach that its immediate consequence is nothing less than to range the likes
of a Huygens, a Newton, a Leibniz, a Eulel; a Lagrange, a Laplace among the
most hot-headed of demagogues? It is tmly shameful that someone was led to
make comparisons of this kind;' <Fran�ois> Arago, Sur l'ancienne Ecole poi:yteclz­
nique (Paris, 1853), p. 42.                                                          [r3,1]
In Le Cure de village, which Balzac wrote in the years 1837 to 13!1.s, there are very
violent attacks on the Ecole Polytechnique (coming in the letter of Gregoire
Gerard to his patron, the banker Grossetete). Balzac fears that the forced study of
the exact sciences would have devastating effects on the spiritual constitution and
life span of the students. Still more characteristic are the following reflections: "I
do not believe that any engineer who ever left the Ecole could build one of the
miracles of architecture which Leonardo dOl Vinci erected-Leonardo who was at
once engineer, architect, and painter, one of the inventors of hydraulic science, the
indefatigable constructor of canals. They are so accustomed while not yet in their
teens to t.he bald simplicity of geometry, that by the time they leave the Ecole they
have quite lost all feeling for grace or ornament. A column, to their eyes, is a
useless waste of material. They return to the point where art begins-on utility
they take their stand, and stay there." H. de Balzac. Le Cu.re de village, ed. Siecle
(Paris) , p. 184.'                                                               [r3,2]


Arago's speech on the question of fortifications4 is directed against the report by
Thiel'S and against Lamartine. The speech is dated January 29, 1841. One of its
most important sections is headed: "The detached forts examined from the point
of view of their political significance. Is it true that governments have never re­
garded citadels as a means of subduing and suppressing populations?" From this
section: I.I.M. Thiel'S does not like to admit. that any government, in order to control
the population, would ever resort to bombarding the towns . . . This illusion cer­
tainly does honor to his humanity and to his taste for fine arts; but . . . few others
would share it. . . . And so . . . one may subscribe to the protestations of 1833
against the detached forts and the smaller fortresses without incurring the epithet
of 'philistine, ' or (,madman,' or other such compliments." Arago, Su.r les Forti­
fications de Paris (Paris, 1841), pp. 87, 92-94.                                    [r3,3]

Arago fights for the ('!'continuous enceinte" as opposed to the " detached forts":
" The goal we should strive for, in fortifying Paris, is clearly to give this gigantic
eity the means of defending itself solely with the aid of its Garde Nationale, its
workers, the population of surrounding areas, and some detachments of regular
army troops . . . . This point granted, the best ramparts for Paris will be those the
population finds to be best-the ramparts most intimately suited to the tastes,
customs, ideas, and needs of an armed bourgeoisie. To pose the question in this
manner is to reject out of hand the system of detached forts. Behind a continuous
surrounding wall, the Garde Nationale would have news of their families at all
times. The wounded would have access to care. In such a situation, the apprehen­
sive guardsman would be as good as the seasoned veteran. On the other hand, we
would he strangely deluded if we imagined that citizens under daily obligations as
heads of families and as heads of businesses would go, without great reluctance, to
shut themselves up -within the four walls of a fort-that they would be prepared to
sequester themselves at the very moment when circumstances of t.he most pressing
kind would demand their presence at the domestic hearth or at the counter, store,
or workshop. I can already hear the response to such imperious demands: the
forts will be occupied hy regular army troops! You admit then that, with a system
of forts, the population could not defend itself alone. This is . . . an immense, a
terrible admission." Arago, Sur les Fortifications de Paris (Paris, 1841), pp. 80-
81.                                                                          [r3a,l]

take the side of the oppressors ." Karl Marx, �'Dem Andenken del' Juni-Kampfee'

doux, are characterized by distinct block-like structures to which staircases and
pedestals are often appended in "standardized" fashion, One might discern in
this style a reflection of Napoleonic military strategy, With this goes the effort to
generate certain effects by means of structural massing. According to Kaufmann,
"Revolutionary architecture aimed to produce an impression through giant
masses, the sheer weight of the forms (hence the preference for Egyptian forms,
which predates the Napoleonic campaign), and also through the handling of
materials. The cyclopean embossment of the saltworks, the powerful ordon­
nance of the Palais de Justice at Aix, and the extreme severity of the prison
designed for this city . . . speak clearly of that aim:' Emil Kaufmann, Von Ledoux
bis Le em'busier (Vienna and Leipzig, 1933), p. 29.                            [r4,1]

Ledoux's planned toll-helt for Paris: "'From the beginning, he set his sights as high
as possible. His tollgates were intended to proclaim from afar the glory of the
capital. Of the more than forty guardhouses, not one resemhled any of the others,
and among his papers after his death were found a number of unfinished plans for
expanding the system." Emil Kaufmann, Von Ledoux bis Le Corbusier: Ursprung
und Entwicklung del' autonomenArchitektur (Vienna and Leipzig, 1933) , p . 27.

��Shortly after 1800, things were already so far along that the ideas which appear
in Ledoux and Boullee-elemental outbursts of passionate natures-were heing
propounded as official doctrine . . . . Only three decades separate the late work of
Blondel, which still . . . embodies the teachings of French classicism, from the
Precis des leqons d'architectnre of Durand, whose thinking had a decisive
influence during the Empire and in the period following. They are the three dec­
ades of Ledoux�s career. Durand � who announced the norm from his chair at the
Ecole Royale Polytechnique in Paris, . . . diverges from Blonde! on all essential
points. His primer hegins . . . with violent attacks on two famous works of classic
Baroque art. St. Peter�s in Rome� along with its square � and the Paris Pantheon
are invoked as counterexamples . . . . Whereas Blondel warns of 'monotonous
planimetl'Y � and would not he unmindful of the function of perspective � Durand
sees in the elementary schemata of the plan the only correct solutions." Emil

First Sketches
Paris Arcades < I >




These early sketches for 171e Arcades Prqject (Gesammelte Schrj/lt'll} vol.   5 [Frankfurt: Suhrkamp,
1982], pp. 991-1038) were written by Benjamin in a bound notebook that contains various other
notcs and drafts dating from mid-1927 to early 1930. Many of the sketches are crossed out in
Benjamin's manuscript, presumably because in most cases they were revised and transferred to the
manuscript of the convolutes; these canceled sketches are printed here in a smaller typesize, with
cross-references to the con"esponding entries in the convolutes and early drafts. (Some of the UllCatl­
celed sketches, in the larger typesize, were also transferred to the convolutes, and are accordingly
cross-referenced.) Cross-references should not be considered exhaustive. The numbering here, as in
"The Arcades of Paris;' is that of the German editor and bears no relation to the numbering of the
convolutes. TIle sig11 <x> indicates an illegible word.

When, as children, we were made a present of those great encyclopedic works­
World and Mankind or The Earth or the latest volume of the New Uiliverse­
wasn't it into the rIlulticolored "Carboniferous Landscape" or "European Annual
Kingdom of the Ice Age" that we plunged first of all, and weren't we, as though at
first sight, drawn by an indeterminate affinity between the ichthyosaurs and
bisons, the mammoths and the woodlands? Yet this same strange rapport and
primordial relatedness is revealed in the landscape of an arcade. Organic world
'Uld inorganic world, abject poverty and insolent luxury enter into the most
contradictory communication; the commodity intermingles and interbreeds as
promiscuously as images in the most tangled of dreams. Primordial landscape of
consumption. <See aO,3.>                                                                       <AD,S>
Trade and traffic are the two components of the street. Now, in the arcade the first of these
<error, corrected in A3a,7> has all but died out: the traffic there is TIldimentaTY. The
arcade is a street of lascivious commerce only; it is wholly adapted to arousing desires.
Thus, there is no mystery in the fact that whores feel spontaneously drawn there. Because
in this street all thejuices slow to a standstill, the commodity proliferates along the house
fronts and enters into new and fantastic combinations, like the tissue in tUmors. <A0 , 6 >


The will turns down the wide street into the teeth of pleasure and, as lust, drags
with it into its gloomy bed whatever it finds in the way of fetish, talisman, and
gage of fate across its path, drags with it the rotting debris of letters, kisses, and
names. Love presses forward with the inquisitive fingers of desire down the
winding street. Its way leads through the interior of the lover, which opens up to
him in the inlage of the beloved who passes lightly before him. 11ns inlage opens
up his interior to him for the first time. For, as the voice of the truly beloved
awakens in his heart an answering voice which he has never before heard in
himself, the words which she speaks awaken in him thoughts of tlns new, much
more hidden ego that reveals to him her mage, willie the touch of her hand
awakens <broken off>                                                                    <N,7]


Game in which children have to form a brief sentence out of given words. This

Maurice Renard, in his book Le Pen'l bleu, l has told how inhabitants of a distant planet
come to study the flora and fauna indigenous to the lower depths of the atmosphere-in
other words, to the surface of the earth. These interplanetary travelers see in human
beings the equivalent of tiny <?> deep-sea fish-that is to say, beings who live at the
bottom of a sea. We no more feel the pressure of the atmosphere than fish feel that of the
water; this in no way alters the fact that both sets of creatures reside on an ocean floor.
With the study of the arcades, a closely related reorientation in space is opened up. TIle
street itself is thereby manifest as <x> well-worn interior: as living space of the collective,
for true collectives as such inhabit the street. The collective is an eternally awake, eter­
nally agitated being that-in the space between the building fronts-lives, experiences,
understands, invents as much as individuals do within the privacy of their own four walls.
For it, for this collective, enalueled shop signs are a wall decoration as good as, if not
better than, the inexpensive oleograph above the hearth. Walls with their "Post No Bills"
are its writing desk, newspaper stands its libraries, display windows its glazed inaccessible
armoires, mailboxes its bronzes, benches its bedroom furniture, and the cafe terrace is the
balcony from which it looks down on its household. As with a railing where pavers hang
their coats before going to work, the vestibule is the hidden gateway which gives onto a
row of courtyards-is, for it, the corridor that daunts the stTangers and serves as the key
to its dwelling. <See dO,l and M3a,4.>                                                 <A° , 9 >

There is, to speak once more of restaurants, a nearly infallible criterion for determining
their rank. This is not, as one might readily assume, their price range. We find this
unexpected criterion in the color of the sound that greets us when <broken off>     <B ° , 1 >


The solemn, reflective, tranquil character of the Parisian mealtime is measured
less by the particular dishes served than by the stillness that surrounds you in the
restaurant, whether it be before uncovered tables and plain white walls or in a
carpeted and richly furnished dining room. Nowhere does one find the hubbub
of a Berlin restaurant, where patrons like to give themselves airs and where food
is only a pretext or necessity. I know a shabby, dark room in the very middle of
which, a few minutes past noon, milliners from nearby shops gather around long
marble tables. They are the only customers, keeping quite to themselves, and
they have little to say to one another during their short lunch break. And yet-it
is merely a whispering, from which the clinking of knives and forks (refined,
dainty, as though punctuated) continuously rises. In a "Chauffeurs' Rendez­
vous;' as the small bistros like to call themselves, a poet and tlunker can have his
breakfast and, in an international company of Russian, Italian, and French taxi
drivers, advance his thoughts a good distance. If he wants, however, to enjoy the
undivided sociable silence of a public repast, he will not turn his steps toward any
of tl,e venerable old Paris restaurants, and still less toward one of the newer chic
establishments; rather, he goes to seek out, in a remote quartier, the new Parisian
mosque. TI,ere he finds, along with the indoor garden and its fountains, along
with the obligatory bazaar full of carpets, fabrics, and copperware, three or four
medium-sized rooms furnished with stools and divans and lit by hanging lamps.
He must of course bid adieu not only to French cooking, which he exchanges for
a choice Middle Eastern cuisine, but above all to French wines. Nevertheless,
within months of its opening, the best Parisian society had already discovered the
"secrets of the nl0sque" and now takes its coffee in the little garden, or a late
supper in one of tl,e adjoining rooms.                                         <Bo ,2>

Dreams vary according to where you are, what area and what street, but above
all according to the time of year and the weather. Rainy weather in the city, in its
thoroughly treacherous sweetness and its power to draw one back to the days of
early childhood, can be appreciated only by someone who has grown up in the
big city. It naturally evens out the day, and with rainy weather one can do the
same thing day in, day out-play cards, read, or engage in argument-whereas
sunshine, by contrast, shades the hours and is furthemlore less friendly to the
dreamer. In that case, one must get around the day fronl morning on; above all,
one must get up early so as to have a good conscience for idleness. Ferdinand
Hardekopf, the only honest decadent which Cerman literature has produced,
and whom I hold to be, of all thc Ceffi1an poets now in Paris, the most unproduc·
tive and the most able, has in his "Ode vom seligen Morgen" <Ode to Blessed
Morning>;':J which he dedicated to Emmy Hell1ings, laid out for the dreamer the
best precautions to be taken for SUill1Y days. In the history of the jloetes maud£ts,
the chapter describing their battle against the sun is yet to be written; the fogs of
Paris, which is really what we are talking about here, were dear to Baudelaire

Every yem; one hears it said that the last Bastille Day did not measure up to
previous ones. Unfortunately, and by way of exception, it was trne this time. The
reasons: First, the cool weather. Second, the city this year had refused to grat1t the
usual funds to the holiday committee. Third, the franc has to some degree
stabilized." And cveryone knows what a splendid basis for popular festivals a
weakened currency is. Last year, when in July the frallc was in the midst of a
terrific slump, the currency cormnunicated its impetuosity to the desperate pub­
lic. People dat1ced as they had seldom done before. At the streetcomers you
could find the old inlage: long festoons of electric bulbs, platforms with musi­
cians, crowds of the curious. But the dyoamism of the tempos was undoubtedly
weaker, and tile tlnee-day-long festivities did not extend so late into the night as
in years past. On the otller hand, its aftereffect was longer. A small assemblage of

In the first half of the previous century, theaters too, by preference, found a place
in the arcades. In the Passage des Panoraxnas, the The.ltre des Varietes stands
next to the Children's Theater of M. Comte;' another theater, the Cymnase des
Enfants, was located in the Passage de FOpera, where later on, around 1896, the
commentating <?> naturalist theater of Chirac housed the The�tre de Verite, in
which one-act plays were performed by a nude couple. Today, one still finds in
the Passage Choiseul the Bouffes Parisiennes, and if the other theaters have had
to close their doors, the small bare booths of the ticket agents open <something>
like a secret passage to all theaters. But this gives no idea of how strict the
correlation between arcade and theater originally was. Under -, it was the
custom to name fancy-goods shops after the most snccessful vaudevilles of
the season. And since such shops, by and large, made up the most elegant part
of the arcades, the gallery was, in places, like the mockup of a theater. These
magasin.s de nouveautis played a particular role here.                         <co,3>


Claretie speaks of the "stifled perspective" of certain pictures and compares it to
the airlessness of the arcades. <See El,5.> But the perspective of the arcades can
itself be compared to this "suffocated" perspective, which is precisely that of the
stereoscope. The nineteenth century <broken off>                               <co,4>


Energies of repose (of tradition) which carry over from the nineteenth century.
Transposed historical forces of tradition. What would the nineteenth century be
to us if we were bound to it by tradition? How would it look as religion or
mythology? We have no tactile <taktiscll> relation to it. That is, we are trained to
view things, in the historical sphere, from a romantic distance. To account for the
directly transmitted inheritance is important. But it is still too early, for example,
to form a collection. Concrete, materialistic deliberation on what is nearest is
now required. "Mythology;' as Aragon says, drives things back into the distance.
Only the presentation of what relates to us, what conditions us, is important. The
nineteenth century-to borrow the Surrealists' terms-is the set of noises that
invades our dream, and which we interpret on awaking.                          <co,5>


A walk through Paris will begin with an aperitif-tllat is, between five and six
o'clock. I would not tie you down to this. You can take one of the great railroad
stations as your point of departure: the Gare du Nord, with trains leaving for
Berlin; the Gare de l'Est, with departures for Fraukfurt; the Gare Saint-Lazare,
where you can take off for London; and the Gare de Lyon, with its <xxxx> into
the P.L.M. If you want my advice, I'd recommend the Gare Saint-Lazare. There
you have half of France and half of Europe around you; names lil<e Le Havre,
Provence, Rome, Amsterdam, Constantinople are spread through the street lil<e
sweet filling through a torte. It is the so-called Quartier Europe, in which the
greatest cities of Europe have all commissioned a street as emblem of their
prestige. A rather precise and rigorous etiquette prevails in this diplomatic corps
of European streets. Each one is clearly set off against the others, and if they have
some business to transact with one another-at the conlers-they come together
very courteously, without the slightest ostentation. A foreigner who was unaware
of the fact would perhaps never notice tl1at he was in a royal household here.
Atop this particular throne, however, is the Gare Saint-Lazare itself, a robust and
dirty sovereign lady, a clanging puffing princess of iron and smoke. <See Ll ,'l.>
But we are by no means obliged to limit ourselves to railroad stations. Railroad
stations make good starting points, but they also serve very well as destinations,
1bink now of the city's squares. Here, certain distinctions are called for: some
are without history and without name, Thus, there is the Place de la Bastille and
the Place de la Republique, the Place de la Concorde and the Place Blanche, but
there are also others whose designers are unknown, and whose names are often
not to be found on any wall. TIlcse squares are lucky accidents, as it were, in the
urban landscape; they do not enjoy the patronage of history like the Place
Vendilme or the Place de Greve, are not the result of long planning, but instead
resemble architectural improvisations-those crowds ofhonses where the shabby
buildings collide in a jumble, In these squares, the trees hold sway; here the
smallest trees afford thick shade, At night, however, their leaves stand out ag'ainst
the gas-burning street lamps like transparent <x> fruits, These tiny hidden squares
are the nlture <?> Gardens of the Hesperides, <See Pl,2,> Let us suppose, then,
that at five o'clock we sit down to an aperitif on the Place SainteJulie, Of one
thing we may be sure: we will be the only foreigners and will have, perhaps, not
even one Parisian near us, And should a neighbor present himself, he will most
likely give the impression of being a provincial who has stopped in here at the
end of the day to have a beer, Now, here we have a little secret password of
freemasonry by which fanatical Paris-aficionados, French as well as foreign, rec­
ognize one another, This word is "province;' With a shmg of the shoulders, the

And this is the provinces, Here, perhaps, is tl,e secret of the gentle hegemony
which the city maintains over France: in the heart of its neighborhoods, and <that
is to say, its> provinces, it has welc0111cd the other into itself, and so possesses
more provinces than the whole of France, For it would be foolish to depend on
the bureaucratic division into arrondissements here: Paris has more than twenty of
them and comprises a multitude of towns and villagcs, A young Parisian author,

Surrealism-"wave of dreams" -new art of fianerie. New nineteenth-century
past-Paris its classic locale. Here, fashion has opened the place of dialectical
exchange between woman and ware. The clerk, death, tall and loutish, measures
the century by the yard, serves as mannequin himself to save costs, and manages
single-handedly the "liquidation" that in French is called "revolution." <See fO,l

Being past, being no more, is passionately at work in things. To this the historian
tmsts for his subject matter. He depends on this force, and knows things as they
are at the moment of their ceasing to be. Arcades are such monuments of being­
no-more. And the energy that works in them is dialectics. The dialectic takes its
way through the arcades, ransacking them, revolutionizing them, turns thein
upside down and inside out, converting theIn, since they no longer remain what
they are, from abodes of luxury to <x>. And nothing of them lasts except the
name: passages. And: Passage du Panorama <sic>. In the inmost recesses of these

All this is the arcade in our eyes. And it was nothing of all this earlier. <See aO,2
and C2a,9.> So long as the gas lamps, even the oil lamps were burning in them,
the arcades were fairy palaces. But if we want to think of them at the height of
their magic, we must call to mind the Passage des Panoramas around 1870 <?>: on
One side, there was gaslight; on the other, oil lamps still flickered. The decline sets
in with electric lighting. Fundamentally, however, it was no decline but, properly
speaking, a reversaL As mutineers, after plotting for days on end, take possession
of a fortified site, so the commodity by a lightning stroke seized power over the
arcades. Only then canle the epoch of commercial firms and figures. The inner
radiance of the arcades faded with the blaze of electric lights and withdrew into
their names. But their name was now like a filter which let through only the most
intimate, the bitter essence of what had been. (This strange capacity for distilling
the present, as inmost essence of what has been, is, for true travelers, what gives
to the name its exciting and mysterious potency.)                               <Do,G>

In the Passage de la Reunion there was once a courtyard; in the sixteenth cen­

The city made of markets. Thus Riga, when viewed from the other side of the

Music in arcades. It seems to have settled into these spaces only with the decline of dle
arcades-that is to say, only with the advent of mechanical music. (Gramophone. The
"theatrophone' in certain respects its forerumler.) Nevertheless, there was music dlat
conformed to the spirit of the arcades-a panoramic music, such as can be heard today
only in old-fashioned genteel concerts like those of the casino orchestra in Monte Carlo :
the panoramic compositions of David (Le Disert, Herculanum). <See HI,5.>               <Fo,3>

There is a wholly unique experience <Elfohrung> of dialectic. The compelling-the dras­
tic-experience, which refutes everything "gradual" about becoming and shows all seem­
ing "development" to be dialectical reversal, eminendy and thoroughly composed, is the
awakening from dream. For the dialectical schematism at the core of this magic process,
the Chinese have found, in their fairy tales and novellas, the most radical expression.
Accordingly, we present d,e new, the dialectical method of doing history: widl the inten­
sity of a dream, to pass through what has been, in order to experience the present as dle
waking world to which the dream refers! (And every dream refers to the waking world.
Everything previous is to be penetrated historically.) <See hO,4 and KI ,3.>           <FO ,6>


Awakening as a graduated process that goes on in the life of the individual as in that of the
generation. Sleep its initial stage. A generation'S experience of youth has much in com­
mon with the experience <Erfoh1"Ung> of dreams. Its historical configuration is a dream­
configuration. Every epoch has such a side tunlcd towal'd dreanls, the child's side. For the
previous century, it is the arcades. But whereas the education of earlier generations
explained these dreams for them in terms of tradition, of religious doctrine, present-day
education simply amounts to the "distraction" of children. What follows here is an
experiment in the technique of awakening. The dialectical-the Copernican-tunl of
remembrance < Wendung des Eingedenkens> (Bloch) . <See hO,4 and KI,I.>                 <Fo, 7 >


Boredom and dust. Dream a garment one carmot turn. On the outside, the gray boredom
(of sleep) . Sleep state, hypnotic, of the dusty figures in the Musee Grevin. A sleeper is not
a good subject for wax. Boredom <Langeweile> is always the external surface of uncon­
scious events. Therefore, it could appear to the great dandies as a mark of distinction. For
it is precisely <?> the dandy who despises new clothing: whatever he wears must appear
slightly frayed. As opposed to a theory of dreams that would reveal to us "psyches," the
world that comes to seem pointless. What about it? <See eO,2 and D2a,2.>              <Fo ,8>

There are, at bottom, two sorts of philosophy and two ways of noting down
thoughts. One is to sow them in the snow-or, if you prefer, in the fire clay-of
pages; Satum is the reader to contemplate their increase, and indeed to harvest
their flower (the meaning) or their fruit (the verbal expression) . The other way is
to bury them with dignity and erect as sepulcher above their grave the image, the
metaphor-cold and barren marble."                                            <P,12>


Most hidden aspect of the big cities: this historical object, the new metropolis, with its

arcades. <See M6a,4.>                                                                <Fo,13>

What the big city of modern times has made of the ancient conception of the
labyrinth. It has raised it, through the names of streets, into the sphere of lan­
guage, raised it from out of the network of streets in which the city <x> designated
<x> within language <X>.                                                      <Fo , 1 9 >
VVhat was otherwise reserved for only a very few words-a privileged caste of words, the
names-the city has made possible for all words, or at least a great many: to be elevated
to the noble status of name. And this supreme revolution in language was carried out by
what is most general: the street. And a vast order appears in the fact that all names in the
cities nm into one another without exercising any influence <?> on one another. Even
those much-overused names of great men, already half-congealed into concepts, here once
more pass through a filter and regain the absolute; through its street names, the city is
image of a linguistic cosmos. <See P3,5.>                                          <Fo,20>

Only the meeting of two different street names makes for the magic of the
"corner."                                                         <FO,21 >

Names of streets written vertically (when? <x> book? a t any rate German) . On

The structure of books like La Grande Ville, Le Diable Ii Paris, Les Franfais peints par
eux-memes is a literary phenomenon that corresponds to the stereoscopes, panoramas, and
so ford1. <See Q7,6.>                                                           <Fo,23>

TIle true has no windows. Nowhere does the hue look out to the universe. And the
interest of the panorama is in seeing the true city. "The city in the bottle"-the city
indoors. "What is found within the windowless house is the true. One such windowless
house is the theater; hence the eternal pleasure it affords. Hence, also, the pleasure taken
in those windowless rotundas, the panoramas. In the theater, after the beginning of the
perfonnance, the doors remain closed. Those passing through 8Tcades are, in a certain
sense, inhabitants of a panorama. The windows of this house open out on them. They can
be seen out these windows but cannot themselves look in. <See Q&a,7.>              <Fo,24>

rhytlun, there would be nothing "subsistent" for us, but instead everything would happen
right before our eyes ; everything would strike us. But this is precisely what occurs in
dreams. In order to understand the arcades from the ground up, we sink them into the
deepest stratum of the dream; we speak of them as though they had struck us. A collector
looks at things in much the same way. Things come to strike the great collectOl: How he
himself pursues and encounters them, what changes in the ensemble of items are effected
by a newly supervening item-all this shows him his affairs dissolved in constant flux, like
realities in the dream. <See H1a,5.>                                                 <Fo,34>

Ruckert: virgin forests in miniature.


To cultivate fields where, until now, only madness has reigned. Forge ahead with the
whetted axe of reason, looking neither right nor left so as not to succumb to the horror
that beckons from deep in the primeval forest. But every ground must at some point have
been turned over by reason, must have been cleared of the undergrowth of delusion and
myth. This is to be accomplished here for the terrain of the nineteenth century. <See
Nl ,4.>                                                                             <Go,13>


Microcosmic jounley which the dreamer makes through the regions of his own body. For
he has this in common with the madman: the noises emanating from within the body,
which for the salubrious individual converge in a steady surge of health and bring on
sound sleep if they are not overlooked, dissociate for the one who dreams. Blood pres­
sure, intestinal chum, heartbeat, muscle sensations become individually perceptible for
him and demand tbe explanation which delusion or dream image holds ready. This
sharpened receptivity is a feature of the dreaming collective, which settles into the arcades
as into the insides of its own body. We must follow in its wake in order to expound the
nineteenth century as its dream vision.29 <See Kl,4.>                           <GO ,14>

Modernity, the time of hell. The punislunents of hell are always the newest thing going in
this domain. VVhat is at issue is not that "the same thing happens over and over" (much
less is it a question here of eternal return) but rather that the face of the world, the
'
colossal head, precisely in what is newest never alters-that this "newest" remains, in
every respect, the same. This constitutes the etenlity of hell and the sadist's delight in
irmovation. To detennine the totalily of traits which define this "modernity" is to repre­
sent hell. <See 51,S.>                                                                <G°,!7>

Careful investigation into the relation between the optics of the myriorama and
the time of the modern, of the newest. They are related, certainly, as the funda­
mental coordinates of this world. It is a world of strict discontinuity; what is
always again new is not something old that remains, or something past that
recurs, but one and the same crossed by countless intermittences. ('Inus, the
gambler lives in intermittence.) Intermittence means that every look in space
meets with a new constellation. Intermittence the measure of time in film. And
what follows from this : time of hell, and the chapter on origin in tl,e book on
Baroque.so                                                                            <G°,19>

Physiology of beckoning. The nod of the gods (see introduction to Heinle's

has gone astray in the railroad station. On the other hand, the wave to strangers
passing by on a moving train. This above all with children, who are waving to
angels when tl,ey wave to the noiseless, unknown, never-returning people. (Of
course, they are also saluting the passing train.)                                    <Go,25>


Orpheus, Eurydice, Hermes at the train station. Orpheus the one who stays
behind. Eurydice in tl,e midst <?> of kisses. Hermes the statiomnaster with his
signal disk. <See Ll,4.> This a neoclassical motif. With the neoclassicism of
Cocteau, Stravinsky, Picasso, Chirico, and others, it has this in conunon: the
transitional space of awakening in which we now are living is, wherever possible,
traversed by gods. Tlus traversal of space by gods is to be understood as light­
lung-like_ And only certain of the gods may be thought of here. Above all,
Hermes, the masculine god. It is characteristic that, in neoclassicism, the muses
who are so important for classical humanism mean nothing whatsoever. More­
over, there is much in Proust that belongs in the contexts of neoclassicism: names
of gods. Also, the significance of homosexuality in Proust can be grasped from
this perspective alone. More generally, the progressive leveling of the difference
between masculine and feminine elements in love belongs in this space. But what
is important above all in Proust is the stake which the entire work has in the
supremely dialectical dividing point of life: waking up. Proust begins with a
presentation of the space of someone awakening.-Where neoclassicism is basi­
cally lacking is in the fact that it builds an architecture for the gods passing by
which denies the fundamental relations of their coming-to-appearance. (A bad,
reactionary architecture.)                                                        <Go,26>


It is one of the tacit suppositions of psychoanalysis that a clear-cut distinction between
sleeping and waking has no value for the human being or for the empirical impressions of
consciousness in general, but yields before an unending variety of conscious states deter­
mined, in each case, by the level of wakefulness of all psychic and corporeal centers. This
thoroughly fluctuating situation of a consciousness each time manifoldly divided between
waking and sleeping has to be transferred from the individual to the collective. Once this
is done, it becomes clear that, for the nineteenth century, houses are the dream configura­
tions of its deepest level of sleep. <See KI,5.>                                  <Go,27>




All collective architecture of the nineteenth century constitutes the house of the

To render the image of those salons where the gaze was enveloped i n billowing drapery,

On the rhythm of today, which determines this work. Very characteristic is the
opposition, in film, between the downright jerky rhythm of the image sequence,
which satisfies the deep-seated need of this generation to see the "flow" of "devel­
opment" disavowed, and the continuous musical accompaniment. To root out
every trace of "development" from the image of history and to represent becom­
ing-through the dialectical rupture between sensation and tradition-as a con­
stellation in being: that is no less the tendency of this project.                   <H",16>


Delimitation of the tendency of this project with respect to Aragon: whereas Al'agon
persists within the realm of dream, here the concelTI is to find the constellation of awaken­
ing. \Nhile in Al'agon there remains an impressionistic element, namely, the "mythology"
(and tIus impressiOlusm must be held responsible for the many vacuous philosophemes in
his book) , here it is a question of the dissolution of "mythology" into the space of history.
That, of course, can happen only through the awakening of a not-yet-conscious knowl­
edge of what has been. <See Nl,9.>                                                   <Ho,17>


Interiors of our childhood days as laboratories for the demonstration of ghostly

Uprising of the anecdotes. The epochs, currents, cultures, movements always concern the
bodily life in one and the same, identical fashion. TIlere has never been an epoch that did
not feel itself to be "modem" in the sense of most eccentric, and suppose itself to be
standing directly before an abyss. A desperately clear consciousness of gathering crisis is
something chronic in humanity. Every age llllavoidably seems to itself a new age. But the
"modernity" that concenlS men with respect to the bodily is as varied in its meaning as
the different aspects of one and the same kaleidoscope. -The constructions of history are
comparable to instructions that commandeer the hue life and confine it to barracks. On
the other hand: the street insurgence of the anecdote. 'The anecdote brings things near to
us spatially, lets them enter our life. It represents the strict antithesis to the sort of history
which demands "empathy:' which makes everything abstract.        "Ernpatll)! ": this is what
newspaper reading terminates in. The true method of making things present is: to represent
them in our space (not to represent ourselves in their space) . Only anecdotes can do this
for us. Thus represented, the dungs allow no mediating construction from out of "large
contexts."-It is, in essence, the same with the aspect of great things from the past-the
cathedral of Charh'es, the temple of Paestum: to receive them into our space (not to feel
empathy with their builders or their priests) . We don't displace our being into theirs: they
step into our life.-The same technique of nearness may be observed, calendrically, with
regard to epochs. Let us imagine that a man dies on the very day he turns fifty, which is
the day on which his son is born, to whom the same thing happens, and so on. The result
would be: since the birth of Christ, not forty men have lived. Purpose of this fiction: to
apply a standard to historical times that would be adequate and comprehensible to human
life. TIlls pathos of nearness, the hatred of the abstract configuration of human life in
epochs, has animated the great skeptics. A good example is Anatole France. On the
opposition between empathy and actualization: jubilees, Leopardi 13.33 <See Sla,4; Sla,3;

The rationalist theory of fashion appears very characteristically in Karr. It bears a resem­

foot. Or he denounces, as the origin of certain types of hats and certain hairstyles, the
'Wish to compensate for thin hair, <See Bl,7.>                                        <]°,6>

For the architectural unage of Paris the war of 1870 was perhaps a blessing, seeing that

Opposition of perspective and concrete, tactile nearness.

In the theory of collecting, the isolation, the segregation of every single object is very
important. A totality-whose integral character always stands as far removed as possible
from utility and, in preeminent cases, resides in a strictly defined, phenomenologically
quite remarkable type of "completeness" (which is diametrically opposed to utility) . <See

Historical and dialectical relation between diorama and photography.

Important in regard to collecting: the fact that the object is detached from all original
ftmctions of its utility makes it the more decided in its meaning. It functions now as a true
encyclopedia of all knowledge of the epoch, the landscape, the industry, and the owner
from which it comes. <See Hla,2.>                                                   <K°,lO>

First London exhibition of 185 1 brings together industries from around the world. Fol·

In 1903, in Paris, Emile Tardieu brought out a book entitled L'l!.rmui, in which all human
activity is shown to be a vain attempt to escape from boredom, but in which, at the same
time, what is, what was, and what will be appear as the inexhaustible nourishment of that
feeling. In view of such a portrait, one might suppose the work to be some mighty classical
monument of literature-a monument aere perenniuJ erected by a Roman to the taedium
vitae ,37 But it is only the self-satisfied, shabby scholarship of a new Homais, who aims to
tum the most serious matters-asceticism and martyrdom included-into documents of
his thoughtless, spiritually barren, petty-bourgeois discontent. <See Dl,5.>       <K° ,21 >


To be mentioned in connection with the fashion in shawls: the characteristic and, properly
speaking, sole decoration of the Biedenneier room "was afforded by the curtains,
which-extremely refined and compounded preferably from several fabrics of different
colors-were funushed by the upholsterer. For nearly a whole century afterward, interior
decoration amounts, in theory, to providing instructions to upholsterers for the tasteful
arrangement of draperies." Max von Boehn, Die Mode im XIX Jahrhundert) voL 2 (Mu­
nich, 1907), p. 130. <See El,l.>                                                   <Ko,22>

Within the fralnes of the pictures that hung on dining room walls, the advent of whiskey
advertisements, of Van Houten Cocoa, of . . . is gradually heralded. Naturally, one can
say that the bourgeois comfort of the dining room has survived longest in small cafes and
other such places ; but perhaps one can also say that the space of the cafe, within which
every square meter and every hour is paid for much more precisely than in apartment
houses, evolved out of the latter. Apartments laid out like cafes-in Frankfurt am Main,
something very characteristic of that town. Attempt to fonnulate what there was inside.

Empty, brightly lit streets as we enter cities at night. They surround us in fan-shaped
fomlation, travel out and away from us like rays of a mandorla. And the glance into a
room will always find a family at a meal or else occupied with some obscure niggling thing
at a table under a hanging lamp, its white glass globe set into a metal frame. Such eidola
are the genn cells of Katka's work. And this experience remains an inalienable possession
of his generation, his only-and therefore ours, because only for it do the horror-furnish­
ings of incipient high capitalism fill the scenes of its most luminous childhood experi­
ences.-Unexpectedly, the street emerges here such as we never otherwise experience it,
as way, as built-up thoroughfare. �See 13,3.>                                       �KO ,27>

Say something abollt the method of composition itself: how everything one is thinking at
a specific moment in time must at all costs be incorporated into the project then at hand.
Assume that the intensity of the project is thereby attested, or that one's thoughts, from
the very beginning, bear this project within them as their telos. So it is ,vith the present
portion of the work, which aims to characterize and to preserve the intervals of reflection,
the distances lying between the most essential parts of this work, which are turned most

The J-Iuman Comedy comprises a series of works which are not novels, in the ordinary
sense of the tenn, but something like epic transcription of the tradition from the first
decades of the Restoration. Entirely in the spirit of oral tradition is the interminability of
this cycle, the antithesis to F1auberes rigorous conception of form. No doubt about it-the
nearer a work stands to the collective forms of expression of the epic, the more it tends, in
varying and episodic development, to summon up the same recurrent circle of figures,
according to the eternal paradigm of Greek legend. Balzac had secured this mythic
constitution of his world through precise topographic contours. Paris is the breeding
ground of his mythology, Paris with its two or three great bankers (like Nucingen) , with
its continually reappearing doctor, with its enterprising merchant (Cesar Birotteau) , with
its four or five great courtesans, with its usurer (Gobseck) , with its sundry soldiers and
bankers. But above all-and we see this again and again-it is from the same streets and
comers, the same little rooms and recesses, that the figures of this world step into the light.
What else can this mean but that topography is the ground plan of every mythic space of
tradition, < Traditionsraum>, and that it can become indeed its key-just as it became the
key for Pausaruas in Greece, and just as the history, layout, distribution of the Paris
arcades are to become the key for the underworld of this century, into which Paris has
sunk. <See C1,7.>                                                                      <V,7>

Excursus on the Place du Maroc. Not only city and interior but city and open air can
become entwined, and this intertwining can occur much more concretely. There is the
Place du Maroc in Belleville: that desolate heap of stones with its rows of tenements
became for me, when I happened on it one Sunday afternoon, not only a Moroccan desert
but also, and at the same time, a monument of colonial imperialism; and topographic
vision was entwined -with allegorical meaning in this square, yet not for an instant did it
lose its place in the heart of Belleville. But to awaken such a view is something ordinarily
reserved for intoxicants . And in such cases, in fact, street names are like intoxicating
substances that make our perception more stratified and richer in spaces than it is in
everyday existence. The state into which these street names transport <us>, their vertu
evacatrice (but this is saying too little, for what is decisive here is not the association but the
interpenetration of images) ought also to be considered in connection -with certain cycloid
states. The patient who wanders the city at night for hours on end and forgets the way
home is perhaps under the sway of this power. <See Pla,2.>                                <Lo ,25>

The deepest enchantment of the collector: to put things under a spell, as though at a

not be assumed that the collector, the flaneur, would [md anything strange in the topas

types of things. He loses himself, assuredly. But in return, he has the strength to raise

Various of the Berlin arcades should be mentioned: the colonnade in the vicinity
of the Spittelmarkt (Leipziger Strasse), the colonnade in a quiet street of the
clothiers' district, the arcade, the colonnade at tbe Halle Gate, the railing at the
entry to private ways. Also to be kept in mind is the blue postcard of the Halle
Gate, whicb showed all the windows lit up beneath tbe moon, illuminated by
exactly the same light as came from the moon itself. Think further of the un­
touchable Sunday afternoon landscape that opens out somewhere at the end of a
forlorn secluded street of "faded gentility"; in its neatness, the houses of this
dubious neighborhood seem suddenly changed to palaces.                       <Mo , l >


Magic of cast iron: "Hahblle was able then to convince himself that the ring around this

Grandville's works aTe a veritable cosmogony of fashion. Equally important, perhaps, a
comparison between Hogarth and Grandville. A part of Grandville's work might be
entitled '�Fashion's Revenge on the Flowers:' Grandville's works are the sibylline books of
jJUbliciti. Everything that, with him, has its preliminary form as joke, or satire, attains its

The dreaming collective knows no history. Events pass before it as always identical and
always new. The sensation of the newest and most modem is, in fact, as much a dream
fonnation of events as the "eternal return of the same." The perception of space that
corresponds to this perception of time is superposition. Now, as these formations dissolve
within the enlightened consciousness, political-theological categories arise to take dieir
place. And it is only within the purview of these categories, which bring the flow of events
to a standstill, that history forms, at the interior of this How, as crystalline constellation.­
The economic conditions under which a society exists not only determine that society in
its material existence and ideological superstructure; they also come to expression. In the
case of one who sleeps, an overfull stomach does not find its ideological superstructure in
the contents of the dream-and it is exactly the same with the economic conditions of life
for the collective. It interprets these conditions ; it explains them. In the dream, they find
their expression; in the awakening, their interpretatz"on. <See S2,1 and K2,5.>     <Mo,14>


The man who waits-a type opposed to the flii.neur. The flii.neur's apperception
of historical time, set off against the time of one who waits. Not looking at his
watch. Case of superposition while waiting: the image of the expected woman
superimposes itself on that of some unknown woman. We are a dam holding
back the time which, when the awaited woman appears, breaks upon us in a
mighty torrent. "Tous les objets sont des maltres" (Edouard Karyade). <M",15>

The fact that we were children during this time belongs together 'VVith its objective image.
It had to be this way in order to produce this generation. That is to say: we seek a
teleological moment in the context of dreams. Which is the moment of waiting. The
dream waits secretly for the awakening; the sleeper surrenders himself to death only
provisionally, waits for the second when he will cunningly wrest himself from its clutches.
So, too, the dreaming collective, whose children provide the happy occasion for its own
awakening. <See Kla,2.>                                                             <Mo,16>


Look into the connection between colportage and pornography. Pornographic
picture of Schiller-a litho: with one hand he gestures, picturesquely posed, into

Schiller. The ghostly and lascivious monk; the long train of specters and de­
bauchery; in the Memoires des Saturnin, by Mme. de Pompadour, the lewd proces­
sion of monks, with the abbot and his cousin at the head.                <M" ,17>


We are bored when we don't know what we are waiting for. And that we do know, or

At the entrance to the skating rink, to the provincial pub, to the tennis court: penates. The
hen that lays the golden praline-eggs, the machine that stamps our names on nameplates,
slot machines, the mechanical fortuneteller-these guard the threshold. Oddly, such
machines don't flourish in the city but rather are a component of excursion sites, of
beer gardens in the suburbs. And when, in search of a little greenery, one heads for
these places on a Sunday afternoon, one is turning as well to the mysterious thresholds.

The gallery that leads to the Mothers is made of wood. Likewise, in the large-scale
renovations of the urban scene, wood plays a constant though ever-shifting role: amid the
modem traffic, it fashions, in the wooden palings and in the wooden planking over open

Threshold and boundary must be very carefully distinguished. The Schwelle <tlneshold>
is a zone. And indeed a zone of transition. Transformation, passage, flight <?> are in the
word schwellen <swell>, and etymology ought not to overlook dlese senses. On the other
hand, it is necessary to keep in mind the immediate tectonic framework that has brought
the word to its current meaning. We have grown very poor in threshold experiences,
"Falling asleep') is perhaps the only such experience that remains to us. But also the ebb
and flow of conversation and the sexual permutations of love, like the world of figures in
the dream, rise up over the threshold.-Out of the field of experience proper to the

The indestructibility of the highest life in all things. Against the prognosticators of de­
cline. One can make a film of Goethe's Faust. And yes, isn't it an outrage, and isn't there
a world of difference between the poem Faust and the fihn Faust? Certainly, there is. But
again, isn't there a whole world of difference between a bad film of Faust and a good one?
VVhat matter in culture are not the great contrasts but the nuances. <It is from them that>
the world <is> always <born anew>. <See N1a,4.>                                          <00,1>


Pedagogic side of this undertaking: "To educate the image�making medium within us,
raising it to a stereoscopic and dimensional seeing into the depths of historical shadows."
The words are <Rudolf> Borchardt's in Epilegomena zu Dante, voL 1 (Berlin, 1923),
pp. 56-57. <See N1,S.>                                                                   <0",2>


From the start, to keep this thought in view and to weigh its constructive value: the refuse­
and decay-phenomena as precursors, in some degree mirages, of the great syntheses that
follow. These new synthetic realities are to be looked for everywhere : advertising, film
reality) and so on. <See Yl,4.>                                                          <00,3>


Of vital interest to recognize, at a particular point of development, currents of thought at
the crossroads-namely, the new view on the historical world at the point where a
decision is forthcoming as to its reactionary or revolutionary application. In this sense,
one and the same phenomenon is at work in the Surrealists and in Heidegger. <See S1,6.>

It is said dlat the dialectical method consists in doing justice, at each moment, to the
concrete historical situation of its object. But that is not enough. For it is just as much a
matter of doingjustice to the concrete historical situation of the interest taken in the object.
And this situation is always so constituted as to be itself preformed in that object; above
all, however, the object is felt to be concretized in this situation itself and upraised from its
former being into the higher concretion of now�being <Jetztsein.>. In what way this now­
being (which is something other than the now-being of the present time <Jehheit» already
signifies, in itself, a higher concretion-this question, of course, can be entertained by the
dialectical method only within the purview of a philosophy of history that at all points has
overcome the ideology of progress. In regard to such a philosophy, one could speak. of an
increasing concentration (integration) of reality, such that everything past (in its time) can
acquire a higher grade of actuality than it had in the moment of its existing. How it adapts
to this, its own higher actuality, is something determined and brought to pass by the image
as which and in which it is comprehended.-To treat the past (better: what has been) in
accordance with a method that is no longer historical but political. To make political
categories into theoretical categories, insofar as one dared to apply them only in the sense
of praxis, because only to the present-that is the task. The dialectical penetration and
actualization of former contexts puts the truth of all present action to the test. This means,
however: the explosive materials latent in fashion (which always refers back to something
past) have to be ignited. <See K2,3.>                                                    <0",5>


On the figure of the collector. One may start from the fact that the true collector detaches
the object from its functional relations. But that is hardly an exhaustive description of this
remarkable mode of behavior. For isn't this the foundation (to speak with Kant and
Schopenhauer) of that "disinterested" contemplation by virtue of which the conector
attains to an tmequaled view of the object-a view which takes in more, and other, than
that of the profane owner and which we would do best to compare to the gaze of the great
physiognomist? But how his eye comes to rest on the object is a matter elucidated much
more sharply through <another> consideration. <See H2,7; H2a,l.>                         <00,6>
00   It must be kept in mind that, for the collector, the world is present, and indeed ordered, in
"'
00
each of his objects. Ordered, however, according to a surprising and, for the profane
understanding, incomprehensible cOlmection. This connection stands to the customary
ordering and schematization of things something as their arrangement in the dictionary
stands to a natural arrangement. We need only recall what importance a particular collec­
tor attaches not only to his object but also to its entire past, whether this concerns the
origin and objective characteristics of the thing or the details of its ostensibly external
history: previous owners, price of purchase, current value, and so on. All of these-the
"objective" data together with the other-come together, for the true collector, in every
single Oile of his possessions, to form a whole magic encyclopedia, a world order, whose
outline is the fole of his object. Here, therefore, within this circumscribed field, we can
understand how great physiognomists (and collectors are physiognomists of the world of
dungs) become interpreters of fate. It suffices to observe just one collector as he handles
the items in Ius showcase. No sooner does he hold them in his hands than he appears
inspired by them and seems to look through them into their distance, like an augur. (It
would be interesting to situate the bibliophile as the only type of collector who has not
Wlconditionally withdrawn his treasures from a functional context.) <See H2,7; H2a,I.>

Attempt to develop Giedion's thesis. "In the nineteenth century," he writes, "construction
plays the role of the subconscious."4-7 Wouldn't it be better to say "the role of bodily

work of physiological processes? <See KIa»                                           <0°,8>


Bear in mind that commentary on a reality (such as we are writing here) calls for a method

the collective. We must look into how it awakes. For example, in advertising. Would
awakening be the synthesis derived from the thesis of dream consciousness and the
antithesis of waking consciousness? <See K2a,4.>                                    <0° , 1 1 >

To be developed: motif of boredom amid half-finished material.

111e "ultimate allns" of socialism hardly ever so clear as in the case of Wiertz.
TI,e basis here in vulgar materialism.                                    <0°,16>
The grandiose mechanical-materialistic divinations of Wiertz have to be seen in
the context of the subjects of his painting-and, to be sure, not only the ideal
utopian subjects but those allied to colportage and the ghastly.                    <0°,17>


Advertisement by Wiertz: "Monsieur Wiertz requires a servant skilled in the
painting of medieval accessories to do all his research work, etcetera, etcetera,
such as <x>, etcetera." A.J. Wiertz, Oeuvres litteraires (Paris, 1870), p. 235.
<0°,18>


Of particular importance, the great "legend" with which Wiertz has accompanied his
Pensees et visions d'une tete coupee (1boughts and Visions of a Severed Head). The first
thing that strikes one about this magnetopathic experience is the grandiose sleight of hand
which the consciousness executes in death. "What a singular thing! The head is here
under the scaffoldl and it believes that it still exists above, fonning part of the body, and
continuing to wait for the blow that will separate it from the trunk." A.J. Wiertz, OeuV1-es
litteraires (Paris, 1870), p. 492. (At work here in Wiertz is the same inspiration that ani­
mates the unforgettable short story by Ambrose Bierce.,18 The rebel who is hanged from a
bridge over the river,) <See K2a,2.>                                                <0° , 1 9 >


Does fashion die because i t can no longer keep u p the tempo-at least in certain fields?
VVhile, on the other hand, there are fields in which it can follow the tempo and even
dictate it? <See B4,4.>                                                             <0° ,20>


Title of a painting by Wiertz: Les Choses du present devant les hommes de I'avenir
<The Things of the Present on Display before the Men of the Future>. Note­
worthy is the tendency of this painter toward allegory. For example, in the
catalogue description of the picture Une Second apres la mort, we read: "Consider
tlle idea of a book that has fallen from one's hands, and on its cover these words:
Difly Achievements ofHumanity." Oeuvres litteraires, p. 496. Figure of "civilization"

special rifle range for ladies and offering, as prize in the competition, a portrait of
the victorious heroine." Oeuvres litteraires, p. 501 (catalogue of works, edited by
the painter himself) .                                                              <0°,22>

Yard badge. TIlat was in the context of a conversation in which I was describing how this
work-comparable to the method of atomic fission, which liberates the enomlOUS ener­
gies bound up within the atom-is supposed to liberate the enormous energies of history
that are slumbering in the llonce upon a time" of classic historical narrative, The history
that was bent on showing things "as they really and truly were" was the strongest narcotic
of the nineteenth century, <See N3,4.>                                             <00,71>
Concretion extinguishes thought; abstraction kindles it. Every antithesis is ab­
stract; every synthesis, concrete. (Synthesis extinguishes thought.)                  <0°,72>


Formula: construction out of facts. Construction with the complete elimination
of theory. What only Goethe in his morphological writings has attempted.

On gambling. There is a certain structure of fate that can be recognized only in money,

The arcade as temple of Aesculapius. Medicinal spring. The course of a cure.
Arcades (as resort spas) in ravines. At Schuls-Tarasp, at Ragaz. The gorge as
landscape ideal in our parents' day. <See L3,1.> As with the impact of very distant
memories, the sense of smell is awakened. To me, as I stood before a shop
window in Saint-Moritz and looked on mother-of-pearl pocketknives as "memo­
ries;' it was as though at that moment I could smell them.                            <0°,75>


The things sold in the arcades are souvenirs <Andenken>. The "souvenir" is the
form of the commodity in the arcades. One always buys only mementos of the
commodity and of the arcade. Rise of the souvenir industry. As the manufacturer
knows it. The custom-house officer of industry. <SeeJ53,1.>                           <0°,76>


How visual memories emerge transformed after long years. The pocketknife that
came to me as I chanced upon one in a shop window in Saint-Moritz (with the
name of the place inscribed between sprigs of mother-of-pearl edelweiss) had a
taste and odor.                                                                       <0°,77>


Rather than pass the time, one must invite it in. To pass the time (to kill time, expel it): to
be drained. Type: gambler, time spills from his every pore.-To store time like a battery:
the type, flaneur. Finally, the synthetic type (takes in the energy "time" and passes it on in
altered fonn): he who waits. <See 03,4.>                                              <0°,78>


"Primal history of the nineteenth century"-this would be of no interest if it were W1der�
stood to mean that forms of primal history are to be recovered among the inventory of the
nineteenth century. Only where the nineteenth century would be presented as originary
form of primal history-as a form, that is to say, in which the whole of primal history so
renews itself that certain of its older traits would be recognized only as precursors of these
recent ones-only there does this concept of a primal history of the nineteenth centmy
have meaning. <See N3a,2.>                                                            <0°,79>


All categories of the philosophy of history must here be driven to the point of
indifference. No historical category without its natural substance, no natural
category without its historical filtration.                                           <0°,80>


Historical knowledge of the truth is possible only as overcoming the illusory
appearance <Aufhebung des Scheins>. Yet this overcoming should not siguify subli-
mation, actualization of the object but rather assume, for its part, the configura­
tion of a rapid image. The small quick figure in contrast to scientific complacency.
This configuration of a rapid image goes together with the recognition of the
"now" in thingS.57 But not the future. Surrealist mien of things in the now;
philistine mien in the future. The illusion overcome here is that an earlier time is
in the now. In truth: the now <is> the imuost image of what has been.        <0°,81>




For the flower section. Fashionjournals of the period contained instructions for preserving
bouquets. <See I4,2.>                                                                <po,l>

The mania for chamber and box. Everything came in cases, was covered and
enclosed. Cases for watches, for slippers, for thermometers-all with embroidery
on fine canvas. <See 14,4.>                                               <po ,2>

Analysis of dwelling. The difliculty here is that on dle one hand, in dwelling, the age­
old-perhaps etclual-has to be recognized: image of that abode of dlC hmnan being in
the matenml womb. And then, on the other hand, this motif of primal history notwith­
standing, we must understand dwelling in its most extreme [ann as a condition of nine­
teenth-century existence, one with which we have begun to break. The original fann of all
dwelling is existence not in the house but in the shelL TIle difference between the two:
<the latter> bears quite visibly the impression of its occupant. In the most extreme in­
stance, the dwelling becomes a shell. The nineteenth cenlury, like no other century, was
addicted to dwelling. It conceived the residence as the receptacle for the person, and it
encased him, with all his appurtenances, so deeply in the dwelling's interior that one
might be reminded of the inside of a compass case, where the instrument with all its
accessories lies embedded in deep, usually violet folds of velvet. It is scarcely possible
nowadays to think of all the things for which the nineteenth century invented etuis:
pocket watches, slippers, egg cups, thennometers, playing cards. What didn't it provide
with jackets, carpets, wrappers! The twentieth century, with its porosity and transparency,
its tendency toward the well-lit and airy, has nullified dwelling in the old sense. Jumping­
off point of things <?>, like the "homes for human beings" in Ibsen's Master Builder. Not
by chance a drcuna rooted inJugendstil, which itself unsettled the world of the shell in a
radical way. Today this world is highly precarious. Dwelling is diminished: for the living,
tl1Tough hotel rooms; for the dead, through the crematorium. <See 14,4.>              <po,3>

Dialectics at a standstill-this is the quintessence of the method.

"To dwell" as a transitive verb. For example, "indwelt spaces"-this gives a sense of the
hidden frenetic topicality of dwelling. This topicality consists in fashioning a shell. <See
14,5.>                                                                               <po,S>

Kitsch. Its economic analysis. In what way is manifest here: the overproduction
of commodities; the bad conscience of producers.                         <po,6>

Fashion. A sort of race for first place in the social creation. The running begins
anew at every instant. Contrast between fashion and unifornl.                <po,7>

was never really a friend of the great outdoors. VVhat mattered to him more than anything
else was the human being-cOlmnunication with, observations about, the simple sight of,
human beings. Whenever he went for a walk in summer, which in good weather hap­
pened every day toward evening, he always made for those public places where he would
run into people. On the way, there was scarcely a tavenl or pastry shop where he would
not look in to see whether anyone-and if so, who-might be there." <See M4a,2.>

We can be sure that the art of an earlier period-in its sociological sphere of
influence, in the hierarchies that were founded on it, in the lll,umer of its forma­
tion-was much more closely related to what today is fashion than to what today
is known as art. Fashion: aristocratic-esoteric origin of the most widely distrib�
uted articles of use.                                                        <�,14>

Misunderstanding as constitutive element in the development of fashion. No

On La Muelte de Portia.62 First performance 1828. An undulating musical extravaganza,
an opera made of draperies, which rise and subside over the words. Very evident the
success which this musical must have had at a time when fa dmjJene was beginning its
triumphal procession (at first, in fashion, as Turkish shawls) . ....The novarum rerum cupidus63
of the revolutionary is understood by tIns public to mean interest in fancy goods. With
good reason it was shown a revolt whose premier task is to protect the king from its own
effect. Revolution as drapery covering a slight reshuffle in the ruling circles, precisely what
occurred in 1830. <See B4,3.>                                                           <�,19>

On the dialectical image. In it lies time. Already with Hegel, time enters into
dialectic. But the Hegelian dialectic knows time solely as the properly historical, if
not psychological, time of thinking. The time differential <Zeitdifforential> in
which alone the dialectical image is real is still unknown to him. Attempt to show
this with regard to fashion. Real time enters the dialectical image not in natural
magnitude-let alone psychologically-but in its smallest gestalt. <See N1,2.>­
All in all, the temporal momentnm <daJ Zeitmoment> in the dialectical image can
be determined only through confrontation with another concept. This concept is
the "now of recognizability" <Jetzt der Erkennbarkeit>.                     <�,2 1>

What is "always the same thing" is not the event but the newness of the event,

Am I the one who is called W.B., or am I simply called w.B.? These are two sides
of a medallion, but the second side is worn and effaced, while the first is freshly
minted. This initial take on the question makes it evident that the name is object
of a mimesis. Of course, it is in the nature of the latter to show itself not in what
is about to happen, but always only in what has been-that is, in what has been
lived. The habitus of a lived life: this is what the name preserves, but also marks
out in advance. With the concept of mimesis, it is further asserted that the realm
of the name is the realm of the similar. And since similarity is the organon of
experience <Erfohrung;>, it may be said that the name can be recognized only in
the contexts of experience. Only in them is its essence-that is, linguistic es­
sence-recognizable.                                                          <Q:' ,24>


Point of departure for the foregoing considerations: a conversation with Wiesen­
grund on the operas Electra and Carmen. To what extent their names already
contain within themselves their distinctive character, and thus make it possible
for the child to have a presentiment of these works long before he comes to know
them. (Carmen appears to him in the shawl which his mother has around her on
evenings when she kisses him good night before going to the opera.) The knowl­
edge contained in the name is developed most of all in the child, for the mimetic
capability decreases with age in most people.                                <Q:',25>
## Early Drafts
Arcades




This brief essay, dating from the summer or fall of 1927 (Gesammelte SclmJtell, vol. 5, [Frankfurt:
Suhrkamp, 1982], pp. 1041-1043), is the only completed text we have from the earliest period of
work on The Arcades Prqjecl, when Benjamin was planning to write a newspaper article on the Paris
arcades in collaboration with Franz Hessel. TIle article may have been written by Benjamin and
Hessel together. (See "Materials for 'Arcades."')



On the Avenue Champs-Elysees, between modem hotels with Anglo-Saxon
names, arcades were opened recently and the newest Parisian passage made its
appearance. For its inaugural ceremonYl a monster orchestra in uniform per­
formed in front of flower beds and flowing fountains. The crowd broke, groan­
ing, over sandstone thresholds and moved along before panes of plate glass, saw
artificial rain fall on the copper entrails of late-model autos as a demonstration of
the quality of the materials, saw wheels tnrning around in oil, read on small black
plaques, in pastejewel figures, the prices of leather goods and gramophone re­
cords and embroidered kimonos. In the diffuse light from above, one skimmed
over flagstones. While here a new thoroughfare was being prepared for the most
fashionable Paris, one of the oldest arcades in the city has disappeared-the
Passage de I'Opera, swallowed up by the opening of the Boulevard Haussmann.
Just as that remarkable covered walkway had done for an earlier generation, so
today a few arcades still preserve, in dazzling light and shadowy comers, a past
become space. Antiquated trades survive within these inner spaces, and the
merchandise on display is unintelligible, or else has several meanings. Already
the inscriptions and signs on the entranceways (one could just as well say "exits,"
since, with these peculiar hybrid forms of house and street, every gate is simulta­
neously entrance and exit), already the inscriptions which multiply along the
walls within, where here and there between overloaded coatstands a spiral stair­
case rises into darkness-already they have about them something enigmatic.
''Albert at No. 83" will in all likelihood be a hairdresser, and "Theatrical Tights"
will be silk tights; but these insistent letterings want to say more. And who would
have the courage to take the ·dilapidated stairs up one flight to the beauty salon of
Professor Alfred Bitterlin? Mosaic thresholds, in the style of the old restaurants
of the Palais-Royal, lead to a diner de Paris; they make a broad ascent to a glass
door-but can there really be a restaurant behind it? And the glass door next to
it, which announces a casino and permits a glimpse of something like a ticket
booth with prices of seats posted-would it not, if one opened it, lead one into
darkness rather than a theater, into a cellar or down to the street? And on the
ticket booth hang stockings once again, stockings as in the doll hospital across
the way and, somewhat earlier, on the side table of the tavern.-In the crowded
arcades of the boulevards, as in the semi-deserted arcades of the old Rue Saint­
Denis, umbrellas and canes are displayed in serried ranks : a phalanx of colorful
crooks. Many are the institutes of hygiene, where gladiators are wearingorthope­
die belts and bandages wind round the white bellies of mamlequins. In the
windows of the hairdressers, one sees the last women with long hair; they sport
richly undulating masses, petrified coiffures. How brittle appears the stonework
of the walls beside them and above: cmmbling papier-m&che! "Souvenirs" and
bibelots takc on a hideous aspect; the odalisque lies in wait next to the inkwell;
priestesses in knitted jackets raise aloft ashtrays like vessels of holy water. A
bookshop makes a place for manuals of lovemaking beside devotional prints in
color; next to the memoirs of a chambermaid, it has Napoleon riding through
Marengo and, between cookbook and dreambook, old-English burghers tread­
ing the broad and the narrow way of the GospeL In the arcades, one comes upon
types of collar studs for which we no longer know the corresponding collars and
shirts. If a shoemaker's shop should be neighbor to a confectioner's, then his
festoons of bootlaces will resemble rolls of licorice. Over stamps and letterboxes
roll balls of string and of silk. Naked puppet bodies with bald heads wait for
hairpieces and attire. Combs swim about, frog-green and coral-red, as in an
aquarium; trumpets turn to conches, ocarinas to U111brella handles; and lying in
the fixative pans from a photographer's darkroom is birdseed. TI,e concierge of
the gallery has, in his loge, three plush-covered chairs with crocheted antimacas­
sars, but next door is a vacant shop from whose inventory only a printed bill
remains: "Will purchase sets of teeth in gold, in wax, and broken." I-Iere, in the
quietest part of the side-alley, individuals of both sexes can interview for a staff
position within the confines of a sitting room set up behind glass. On the pale-col­
ored wallpaper full of figures and bronze busts faIls the light of a gas lamp. An old
woman sits beside it, reading. For years, it would seem, she has been alone. And
now tl,e passage is becoming more empty. A small red tin parasol coyly points
the way up a stair to an umbrella ferrule factory; a dusty bridal veil promises a
repository of cockades for weddings and banquets. But no one believes it any
longer. Fire escape, gutter: I am in the open. Opposite is something like an arcade
again-an archway and, through it, a blind alley leading to a one-windowed
H6tel de Boulogoe or Bourgogoe. But I am no longer heading in that direction; I
am going up the street to the triumphal gate that, gray and glorious, was built in
honor of Louis the Great. Carved in relief on tl,e pyramids that decorate its
eolumns are lions at rest, weapons hanging, and dusky trophies.

These originally untitled texts (Gesammelte Schri
fien, vol. 5 , [Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1982], pp, 1044-
1059), written on loose sheets of expensive handmade paper folded in half, date from 1928 or, at the
latest, 1929, when Benjamin was planning to write an essay entitled HPariser Passagen: Eine dialek­
tische Feerie" (Paris Arcades: A Dialectical Fairyland) . In the manuscript they are followed by
citatioru which were largely tTansferred to the convolutes and which therefore are not reproduced in
the Gennan edition at this point. The ordering of the entries here is that of the Gennan editor, who
also gives their original order in the manuscript:

Ms. 1154 recto: aO, I ; aO,3; bO,I; bO,2.
Ms. 1154 verso: cO,3; eO,L
Ms, 1155 recto: cO,l; cO,4; dO,I; dO,2; cO,2,
Ms. 1155 verso: hO,5.
Ms. 1160 verso: hO, l ; aO,2; ro, l ; hO,2; hO,3; hO,4; aO,5.
Ms. 1161 verso: ro,2; eO,2; f',3; aO,4; gO,l.

These texts were among those from which Benjamin read to Adomo and Horkheimer at Konigstein
and Frankfurt in 1929. Prominent correspondences to entries in the convolutes and to the essay
''Arcades'' are indicated in cross-references.



"In speaking of the inner boulevards;' says the Illustrated Guide to Paris, a com­
plete picture of the city on the Seine and its environs from the year 1852, "we
have made mention again and again of the arcades which open onto them. TI,ese
arcades, a recent invention of industrial luxury, are glass-roofed, marble-paneled
corridors extending through whole blocks of buildings, whose owners have
joined together for such enterprises. Lining both sides of these corridors, which
get their light from above, are the most elegant shops, so that the arcade is a city,
a world in miniature, in which customers will find everything they need. During
sudden rainshowers, the arcades are a place of refuge for the unprepared, to
whom they offer a secure, if restricted, promenade-one from which the mer­
chants also benefit." The customers are gone, along with those taken by surprise.
Rain brings in only the poorer clientele without waterproof or mackintosh.
These were spaces for a generation of people who knew little of the weather and
who, on Sundays, when it snowed, would rather wanl1 themselves in the winter
gardens than go out skiing. Glass before its time, premature iron: it was one
single line of descent-arcades, winter gardens with their lordly palms, and
railroad stations, which cultivated the false orchid "adieu" with its fluttering
petals. They have long since given way to the hangar. And today, it is the same
with the human nlaterial on the inside of the arcades as -with the l11aterials of their
constnlction. Pnl1ps are the iron uprights of this street1 mld its glass breakables
are the whores. Here was the last refuge of those infant prodigies that saw the
light of day at the time of the world exhihitions: the hriefcase with interior
lighting, the meter-long pocket knife, or the patented umhrella hanclie with huilt­
in watch and revolver. And near the degenerate giant creatures, ahorted and
broken-down nlatter, We followed the narrow dark corridor to where-between
a discount bookstore, in which colorful tied-up bundles tell of all sorts of failure,
and a shop selling only buttons (mother-of-pearl and the kind that in Paris are
called defitn taisie)-there stood a sort of salon. On a pale-colored wallpaper full
of figures and busts shone a gas lamp. By its light, an old woman sat reading.
'They say she has been there alone for years, and collects sets of teeth "in gold, in
wax1 and broken," Since that daY1 moreovel; we know where Doctor Miracle got
the wax out of which he fashioned Olympia.' TIley are the tme fairies of these
arcades (more salable and more worn than the life-sized ones) : the fOffilerly
world-famous Parisian dolls, which revolved on their musical socle and bore in
their arms a doll-sized basket out of which, at the salutation of the minor chord, a
lambkin poked its curious muzzle. <See AI,I; F3,2; HI,I; ZI,2.>                 <a°,1>

All tills is the arcade in our eyes. And it was nothing of all tllls. They <the
arcades> radiated through the Paris of the Empire like grottoes. For someone
entering the Passage des Panoramas in 18 17, the sirens of gaslight would be
singing to him on one side, while oil-Ianlp odalisques offered enticements from
the other. With the killdling of electric lights, the irreproachable glow was extin­
guished in these galleries, which suddenly became more difficult to find-which
wrought a black magic at entranceways, and peered from blind windows into
their own interior, It was not decline but transformation. All at once1 they were
the hollow mold from which the image of "modenllty" was cast. Here, the
century 11urrored with satisfaction its 11lost recent past. Here was the retirement
home for infant prodigies . . . <See C2a,9; Tla,8; Sla,6>                      <ao,2>

When, as children, we were given those great encyclopedic works World and
Mankind, New Universe, The Earth, wouldn't our gaze always fall, first of all, on
the color illustration of a "Carboniferous Landscape" or on "Lakes and Glaciers
of the First Ice Age"? Such an ideal panorama of a barely elapsed primeval age
opens up when we look through the arcades that are found in all cities. Here
resides the last dinosaur of Europe, the consumer. On the walls of these caverns,
their imnlemorial flora, the commodit)\ luxuriates and enters1 like cancerous
tissue, into the most irregular combinations. A world of secret affinities : palm tree
and feather duster, hair dryer and Venus de Milo, prosthesis and letter-writing
manual come together here as after a long separation. The odalisque lies in wait
next to the inkwell, priestesses raise aloft ashtrays like patens. These items on
display are a rebus; and <how> one ought to read here the birdseed kept in the
fixative-pan from a darkroom, the flower seeds beside the binoculars, the broken
screws atop the musical score, and the revolver above the goldfish bowl-is right
on the tip of one's tongue. Nter all, nothing of the lot appears to be new. The
goldfish come perhaps from a pond that dried up long ago, the revolver will have
been a corpus delicti, and these scores could hardly have preserved their pre·
vious owner from starvation when her last pupils stayed away. <See R2,3.>



Never trust what writers say about their own writings. When Zola undertook to
defend his Therese Raquin against hostile critics, he explained that his book was a
scientific study of the temperaments. His task had been to show, in an example,
exactly how the sanguine and the nervous temperaments act on one another-to
the detriment of each. But this explanation could satisfy no one. Nor does it
explain the unprecedented admixture of colportage, the bloodthirstiness, the
cinematic goriness of ti,e action. W1lich-by no accident-takes place in an
arcade. If this book really expounds something scientifically, ti,en it's the death of
the Paris arcades, the decay of a type of architecture. The book's atmosphere is
saturated with the poisons of this process, and its people are destroyed by them.
<See Hl,3.>                                                                    <aO ,4>


One knew of places in ancient Greece where the way led down into the under­
world. Our waking existence likewise is a land which, at certain hidden points,
leads down into the underworld-a land full of inconspicuous places fi·om which
dreams arise. All day long, suspecting nothing, we pass them by, but no sooner
has sleep come than we are eagerly groping our way back to lose ourselves in the
dark corridors. By day, the labyrinth of urban dwellings resembles conscious­
ness; the arcades (which are galleries leading into the city's past) issue unre­
marked onto the streets. At night, however; under the tenebrous mass of the
houses, their denser darkness bursts forth like a threat, and the nocturnal pedes­
trian hurries past-unless, that is, we have emboldened him to tum into the
narrow hme. <See Cla,2.>                                                       <ao,5>


Falser colors are possible in the arcades; that combs are red and green surprises
no one. Snow White's stepmother had such things, and when tile comb did not
do its work, the beautifnl apple was there to help out-half red, half poison­
green, like cheap combs. Everywhere stockings play a starring role. Now tiley are
lying under phonographs, across the way in a stanlp shop; another time on the
side table of a tavern, where they are watched over by a girl. And again in front of
the stamp shop opposite, where, between the envelopes witil various stamps in
refined assortments, manuals of an antiquated art of life are lovelessly dis­
pensed-Secret Embraces and Maddening Illusions, introductions to outmoded
vices and discarded passions. The shop windows are covered with vividly col­
ored Epinal-style posters, on which Harlequin betroths his daughter; Napoleon
rides through Marengo, and, amid all types of standard artillery pieces, delicate
English burghers travel the high road to hell and the forsaken path of the Gospel.
No customer ought to enter this shop with preconceived ideas; on leaving, he
will be the more content to take home a volume: Malebranche's Recherche de fa
viriti, or Miss Daisy: The Journal oj an English Equestrienne. <See GIa,1 and
"Arcades. " >                                                                   <bO , 1 >


To the inhabitants of these arcades we are pointed now and then b y the signs and
inscriptions which multiply along the walls within, where here and there, be­
tween the shops, a spiral staircase rises into darkness. The signs have little in
common with the nameplates that hang beside respectable entryways but are
reminiscent of plaques on the cages at zoos, put there to indicate not so 11luch the
dwelling place as the origin and species of the captive animals. Deposited in the
letters of the metal or enameled signboards is a precipitate of all the forms of
writing that have ever been in use in the West. "Albert at No. 83" will be a
hairdresser, and "Theatrical Tights " will probably be silk tights, pink and light
blue, for young chanteuses and ballerinas; but these insistent letterings want to
say something more, sometlling different. Collectors of curiosities in the field of
cultural history have in their secret drawer broadsheets of a highly paid literature
which seem, at first sight, to be commercial prospectuses or theatrical bills, and
which squander dozens of different alphabets in disguising an open invitation.
These dark enanleled signs bring to mind the baroque lettering on the cover of
obscene books.-Recall the origin of the modern poster. In 1861, the first litho­
graphic poster suddenly appeared on walls here and there around London. It
showed the back of a woman in white who was thickly wrapped in a shawl and
who, in all haste, had just reached the top of a flight of stairs, where, her head half
turned and a finger upon her lips, she is ever so slightly opening a heavy door to
reveal ti,e starry sky. In this way Wilkie Collins advertised his latest book, one of
the greatest detective novels ever written, The Woman in White. Still color<less>,
the first drops of a shower of letters ran down the walls of houses (today it pours
unremittingly, day and night, on the big cities) and was greeted like the plagues of
Egypt.-Hence the arntiety we feel when, crowded out by those who actually
make purchases, wedged between overloaded coatstands, we read at the bottom
of the spiral staircase : "Institut de Beaute du Professeur Alfred Bitterlin. " And the
"Fabrique de Cravates au Deuxieme "-Are there really neckties there or not?
("111e Speckled Band" {i-om Sherlock Holmes?) Of course, the needlework will
have been quite inoffensive, and all the imagined horrors will be classified objec­
tively in the statistics on tuberculosis. As a consolation, these places are seldom
lacking institutes of hygiene. 'There gladiators wear orthopedic belts, and ban­
dages are wrapped round the white bellies of mannequins. Something induces
the owner of the shop to circulate among them on a frequent basis.-Many are
the aristocrats who know nothing of the A1manach de Gotlla : "Mme. de Con­
solis, Ballet Mistress-Lessons, Classes, Numbers.)) "MIne. de Zalma, Fortune­
teller. " And if, sometime in the mid-Nineties, <we had> asked for a prediction,
surely it would have been: the decline of a culture. <See Gl,6 and "Arcades:'>
<bO ,2>


Often these inner spaces harbor antiquated trades, and even those that are thor­
oughly up to date will acquire in tI,em something obsolete. They are the site of
information bureaus and detective agencies, which there, in the gloomy light of
the upper galleries, follow the trail of the past. In hairdressers' windows, you can
see the last women with long hair. They have richly undulating masses of hait;
which are "pernlanent waves;' petrified coiffures. They ought to dedicate small
votive plaques to those who made a special world of these buildings-to Baude·
laire and Odilon Redon, whose very name sounds like an all too well·turned
ringlet. Instead, they have been betrayed and sold, and the head of Salome itself
made into an ornament-if that which sorrows there in the console is not the
embalmed head of Anna Czyllak. And while these things are petrified, the rna'
sonry of the walls above has become brittle. Brittle, too, are the mosaic thresh­
olds that lead you, in the style of the old restaurants of the Palais-Royal, to a
"Parisian Dinner" for five francs; they mount boldly to a glass dom; but you can
hardly believe that behind this door is really a restaurant. The glass door adja­
cent promises a "Petit Casino" and allows a glimpse of a ticket booth and the
prices of seats; but were you to open it-would it open into anything? Instead of
entering the space of a theater, wouldn't you be stepping down to the street?
Where doors and walls are made of mirrors, there is no telling outside from in,
with all the equivocal illumination. Paris is a city of mirrors. The asphalt of its
roadways smooth as glass, and at the entrance to all bistros glass partitions. A
profusion of windowpanes and mirrors in cafes, so as to make the inside brighter
and to give all the tiny nooks and crannies, into which Parisian taverns separate,
a pleasing amplitude. Women here look at themselves more than elsewhere, and
from this comes the distinctive beauty of the Parisienne. Before any man catches
sight of her, she has already seen herself ten tinles reflected. But the man, too,
sees his own physiognomy flash by. He gains his inlage more quickly here than
elsewhere and also sees himself more quickly merged with this, his inlage. Even
the eyes of passersby are veiled mirrors. And over that wide bed of the Seine,
over Paris, the sky is spread out like the crystal mirror hanging over the drab
beds in brothels. <See H l a, l ; Rl,3; "Arcades.">                             <co,1>


Let two nriaors reflect each other; then Satan plays his favorite trick and opens
here in his way (as his partner does in lovers' gazes) the perspective on infinity. Be
it now divine, now satanic: Paris has a passion for mirror-lil<e perspectives. The
Arc de Triomphe, the San'e Coeur, and even the Pantheon appear, from a dis­
tance, like inlages hovering above the ground and opening, architecturally, a fata
morgana. Baron von Haussmann, when he undertook to transform Paris during
the period of the Third <correction: Second> Empire, was intoxicated wiili these
perspectives and wanted to multiply them wherever possible. In ilie arcades, ilie
perspective is lastingly preserved as in ilie nave of a church. And the windows in
ilie upper story are choir lofts in which ilie angels iliat men call "swallows" are
nesting.-"Hirondelles <-women> who work ilie window:' <See Rl,6 and
Ola,2.>                                                                        <co,2>


Ambiguity of the arcades as an ambiguity of space. Readiest access to this phe­
nomenon would be afforded by ilie multiple deployment of figures in the wax
museum. On the other hand, the resolute focus on the ambiguity of space, a
focus obtained in the arcades, has to benefit the theory of Parisian streets. The
outermost, merely quite peripheral aspect of the ambiguity of the arcades is
provided by their abundance of mirrors, which fabulously amplifies the spaces
and makes Ol�entation more difficult. Perhaps that isn't saying much. Neverthe­
less : though it may have many aspects, indeed infinitely many, it remains-in the
sense of mirror world-ambiguous, double-edged. It blinks, is always just this
one-and never nothing-out of which another iImnediately arises. The space
that transforms itself does so iI, the bosom of nothingness. In its tarnished, dirtied
mirrors, things exchange a Kaspar-Hauser-Iook with the nothing: it is an utterly
equivocal wink coming from nirvana. And here, again, we are brushed with icy
breath by the dandyish name of Odilon Redan, who caught, like no one else, this
look of things in the mirror of nothinguess, and who understood, like no one
else, how to join with things in their collusion with nonbeing. The whispering of
gazes fills the arcades. There is no thing here that does not, where one least
expects it, open a fugitive eye, blinking it shut agalll; and should you look more
closely, it is gone. To the whispering of these gazes, the space lends its echo :
"Now, what;' it blinks, "can possibly have come over lnc?" We stop short in
some sluprise. "V\That, indeed, can possibly have come over you?" Thus we
gently bounce the question back to it. Here, the coronation of Charlemague
could have taken place, as well as the assassiIlation of Henri IV; the death of
<Edward's> sons in the Tower, and the . . . That is why the wax museums are
here. This optical gallery of princes is their acknowledged capital. For Louis XI,
it is the throne room; for York, tl,e Tower of London; for Abdel Krim, the desert;
and for Nero, Rome. <See R2a,3 and Qf,2.>                                       <co,3>


Tbe innermost glowing cells of the ville tumiere, the old dioramas, nested in these
arcades, one of which today still bears the name Passage des Panoramas. It was,
in the very first moment, as though you had entered an aquarium. Along the wall
of the great darkened hall, broken at intervals by narrow joints, it stretched like a
land of illuminated water behind glass. The play of colors among deep-sea fauna
cannot be more fiery. But what carne to light here were open-air, atmospheric
wonders. Seraglios are mirrored on moolit waters; bright nights in deserted parks
loom large. In the moonlight you can recognize the chateau of Saint-Leu, where a
hundred years ago the last Conde was found hanged iI, a wllldow. A light is still
burning iI, a window of the chateau. A couple of tinles tl,e sun splashes wide in
between. In the clear light of a sunmler morning, one sees tlle rooms of the
Vatican as they would have appeared to the Nazarenes; not far beyond rises
Baden-Baden in its entirety, and were we not writing of 1860, one could perhaps
make out among its figurines, on a scale of 1 :10,000, Dostoevsky on the casino
terrace. But candlelight, too,- is honored. Wax tapers encircle the murdered due
de Berry in the dusky cathedral that serves as mortuary cbapel, arld hanging
lamps in the skies beside' practically put round Luna to shame. It was all unpar­
alleled experiment on the moonstmck magic night of Romanticism, and its noble
substance enlerged victorious fronl this ingenious trial. For anyone who was
inclined to linger before the transparent image of the old thermal baths of
Contrexeville, it was as though he had already wandered, in some previous life,
along this sunny way between poplars, had bmshed against the stone wall close
by-modest, magical effects for domestic use, such as otherwise would be expe­
rienced only in rare cases, as before Chinese groups in soapstone or Russian
lacquer-painting. <See Q?,2.>                                           <co,4>

Streets are the dwelling place of the collective. The collective is an eternally
wakeful, eternally agitated being that-in the space between the building
fronts-lives, experiences, understands, and invents as much as individuals do
within the privacy of their own four walls. For this collective, glossy enameled
shop signs are a wall decoration as good as, if not better than, an oil painting in
the drawing room of a bourgeois; walls wiel their "Post No Bills" are its writing
desk, newspaper stands its libraries, mailboxes its bronze busts, benches its bed­
room furniture, and the cafe terrace is the balcony from which it looks down on
its household. The section of railing where road workers hang their jackets is the
vestibule, and the gateway which leads from the row of courtyards out into the
open is the long corridor that daunts the bourgeois, being for the courtyards the
entry to the chambers of the city. Among these latter, the arcade was the drawing
room. More than anywhere else, the street reveals itself in the arcade as the
furnished and familiar intel�or of the masses. <See M3a,4.>                  <do, 1 >

The bourgeois who came into ascendancy with Louis Philippe sets store by the
transformation of near and far into the interior. He knows but a single scene: the
drawing room. In 1839, a ball is held at el,e British embassy. Two hundred rose
bushes are ordered. "The garden;' so runs an eyewitness account, "was covered
by an awning and had the feel of a drawing room. But what a drawing room! The
fragrant, well-stocked flower beds had turned into enormousjardinieres, the grav­
eled walks had disappeared under sumptuous carpets, and in place of the cast­
iron benches we found sofas covered in danlask and silk; a round table held
books and albums. From a distance, the strains of an orchestra drifted into this
colossal boudoir, and, along the triple gallery of flowers on the periphery, exuber­
ant yonng people were passing to and fro. It was altogether delightful!" TI,e
dusty fata morgana of the winter garden, the dreary perspective of the train
station, with the small altar of happiness at the intersection of the tracks-it all
molders, even today, under spurious constructions, glass before its time, prema­
ture iron. <Toward the> middle of the previous century, no one as yet understood
how to build with glass and iron. The problem, however, has long since been
solved by the hangar. <Now> it is the same with the human material on the inside
of the arcades as with the materials of their construction. PinlPS are the iron
uprights of this street, and its glass breakables are the whores. <See 14,1 ; F3,2;
Fl,2.>                                                                         <do,2>

For the flaneur, a transformation takes place with respect to the street: it leads
him through a vanished time. He strolls down the street; for him, every street is
o
00   precipitous. It leads downward-if not to the mythical Mothers, then into a past
00
that can be all the more profound because it is not his own, not private. Never­
theless, it always remains the past of a youth. But why that of the life he has
lived? The ground over which he goes, the asphalt, is hollow. His steps awaken a
surprising resonance; the gaslight that streams down on the paving stones throws
an equivocal light on this double ground. The figure of the llaneur advances over
the street of stone, with its double ground, as though driven by a clockwork
lllechanism. And within, where tIns l11cchanism is ensconced, a Inusic box is
palpitating <?> like some toy of long ago. It plays a tune: "From days of youth, /
from days of youth, / a song is with me still!' By this melody he recognizes what
is around h.iIn; it is not a past coming fronl his own youth, from a recent youth,
but a childhood lived before then tbat speaks to him, and it is all the same to him
whether it is the childhood of an ancestor or his own.-An intoxication comes
over the man who walks long and aimlessly through the streets. With each step,
the walk takes on greater momentum; ever weaker grow the temptations of
bistros, of shops, of smiling WOlllcn, ever luore irresistible the magnetism of the
next streetcorner, of a distant square in the fog, of the back of a woman walking
before him. Then comes hunger. He wants, however, nothing to do with the
myriad possibilities offered to sate his appetite, but like an animal he prowls
through unknown districts in search of food, in search of a woman, until, utterly
exhausted, he stumbles into his room, which receives him coldly and wears a
strange air. Paris created this type. VYhat is reularkable is that it wasn't Rome.
And the reason?Just this: does not dreaming itself take the high road in Rome?
And isn't that city too full of themes, of monuments, enclosed squares, national
shrines, to be able to enter tout entiere-with evety cobblestone, every shop sign,
every step, and every gateway-into the passerby's dream? The national charac­
ter of the Italians may also have much to do with this. For it is not the foreigners
but they themselves, the Parisians, who have made Paris the holy city of the
ll�neur-the "landscape built of sheer life;' as Hofmannsthal once put it. Land­
scape-that, in fact, is what Paris becomes for the flmeur. Or, more precisely, the
city neatly splits for him into its dialectical poles: it opens up to him as a land­
scape, even as it closes around hinl as a rOOlll.-Another tlllng: that anaIllnestic
intoxication in which the llaneur goes about the city not only feeds on the
sensory data taking shape before his eyes but can very well possess itself of
abstract knowledge-indeed, of dead facts-as something experienced and lived
through. This felt knowledge, as is obvious, travels above all by word of moutl1
from one person to another. But in the course of the nineteenth century, it was
also deposited in an immense literature. Even before Lefeuve (who quite aptly
made the following formula the title of his five-volume work), "Paris street by
street, house by house" was lovingly depicted as storied landscape forming a
backdrop to the dreaming idler. The study of these books was, for the Parisian,
like a second existence, one wholly predisposed toward dreaming; the knowledge
these books gave him took form and figure during an afternoon walk before the
aperitif. And wouldn't he necessarily have felt the gentle slope behind the church
of Notre Dame de Lorette rise all the more insistently under his soles if he
co
realized: here, at one time, after Paris had gotten its first omnibuses, the cheval de   co
�
renflrt was harnessed to the coach to reinforce the two other horses.<See Ml,2-
Ml ,5.>                                                                         <e",l>

Boredom is a wann gray fabric lined on the inside with the most lustrous and
colorful of silks. In this fabric we wrap ourselves when we dream. We are at home
then in the arabesques of its lining.But the sleeper looks bored and gray within
his sheath. And when he later wakes and wants to tell of what he dreamed, he
communicates, by and large, only this boredom. For who would be able at one
stroke to turn the lining of time to the outside? Yet to narrate dreams signifies
nothing else. And in no other way can one deal with the arcades-structures in
which we relive, as in a dream, the life of our parents and grandparents, as the
embryo in the womb relives the life of animals. Existence in these spaces flows
then without accent, like the events in dreams. Hanerie is the rhythmics of this
slumber. In 1839, a rage for tortoises overcame Paris.One can well imagine the
elegant set mimicking the pace of this creature more easily in the arcades than on
the boulevards. Boredom is always the extenml surface of unconscious events.
For that reason, it has appeared to the great dandies as a mark of distinction.<See
D2a,1 and D2a, 2.>                                                            <eo,2>

Here fashion has opened the business of dialectical exchange between woman
and ware. The clerk, death, tall and loutish, measures the century by the yard,
serves as mannequin himself to save costs, and manages single-handedly the
liquidation that in French is called "revolution;' For fashion was never anything
other than the parody of the motley cadaver, the provocation of death through
the woman, and bitter colloquy with decay whispered between loud outbursts of
mechanicaljubilation.TIns is why fashion changes so quickly: she titillates death
and is already something different, something new, as he casts about to crush her.
For a hlUldred years she holds her own against him. Now, finally, she is on tlle
point of quitting the field. But he erects on the banks of a new Lethe, which rolls
its asphalt strCaITI through arcades, the armature of the whores as a battle memo­
rial.<Sec Bl,4.>                                                              W,1>

W hen I-Iacklander made use of this "newest invention of industrial luxury" for
one of his fairy tales, he too placed the marvelous dolls in the dangerous arcade
which sister Tinchen, at the behest of the fairy Concordia, has to wander in
order finally to rescue her poor brothers."Fearlessly, Tinchen stepped across the
border into the enchanted land, all the while thinking only of her brothers. At
first she noticed nothing unusual, but soon the way led through an enormous
room entirely filled with toys. She saw small booths stocked with everytlnng
imaginable-carousels with 111iniature horses and carriages, swings and rocking
horses, but above all the most splendid dollhouses.Around a small covered table,
large dolls were sitting on easy chairs; and as Tinehen turned her gaze upon
tllem, the largest and most beautiful of these dolls stood up, made her a graeions
bow, and spoke to her in a little voice of exquisite refinement:' The child may not
want to hear of toys that are bewitched, but the evil spell of this slippery path
readily takes the form, even today, of large animated dolls. But who still remem­
bers, nowadays, where it was that in the last decade of the previous century
women would offer to men their most seductive aspect, the most intimate prom­
ise of their figure? In the asphalted indoor arenas where people learned to ride
bicycles. 'l1,e woman as cyclist competes with the cabaret singer for place of
honor on Cheret's posters (the afjiches) and gives to fashion its most daring line.

Few things in the history of humanity are as well known to us as the history of
Paris. Tens of thousands of volumes are dedicated solely to the investigation of
this tiny spot on the earth's surface. For many streets, we know about the fate of
every single house over a period of centuries. In a beautiful turn of phrase, Hugo
von Hofmalllsthal called this city "a landscape built of pure life." And at work in
the attraction it exercises on people is the kind of beauty that is proper to great
landscapes-more precisely, to volcanic landscapes. Paris is a counterpart in the
social order to what Vesuvius is in the geographic order: a menacing, hazardous
massif, an ever-active June of revolution. But just as the slopes of Vesuvius,
thanks to the layers oflava that cover them, have been transformed into paradisal
orchards, so the lava of revolution provides uniquely fertile ground for the blos­
soming of art, festivity, fashion. <See CI,6.>                                  <1",3>


Hasn't his eternal vagabondage everywhere accustomed him to reinterpreting
the image of the city? And doesn't he transfoml the arcade into a casino, into a
gambling den, where now and again he stal<es the red, blue, yellow jetons of
feeling on women, on a face that suddenly surfaces (will it return his look?), on a
mute mouth (will it speal<?) ? What, on the baize cloth, looks out at the gambler
from every number-luck, that is-here, from the bodies of all the women,
winks at him as the chimera of sexuality: as his type. TIns is notlliog otl,er than
the number, tl,e cipher, in whim just at that moment luck will be called by nanle,
in order to jump immediately to another number. His type-tlnt's the number
that blesses thirty-six-fold, the one on which, witllOut even trying, tl,e eye of tl,e
voluptuary falls, as the ivory ball falls into the red or black compartment. He
leaves the Palais-Royal with bulging pockets, calls to a whore, and once more
fnlds in her amlS the conlllunion with numbel; in which money and riches,
otherwise the Inost burdensome, most massive of things, come to him from the
fates like a joyous embrace returned to the full . For in gambling hall and bordello,
it is the same supremely sinful, supremely punishable delight: to challenge fate in
pleasure. That sensual pleasure, of whatever stripe, could determine the theologi­
cal concept of sin is something tl,at only an unsuspecting idealism can believe.
Detemlining the concept of debauchery in the theological sense is nothing else
but this wresting of pleasure from out of the course of life with God, whose
covenant with such life resides in the name. The name itself is the cry of nal<ed
lust. This holy thing, sobel; fateless in itself-the name-knows no greater ad­
versary than the fate that takes its place in whoring and that forges its arsenal in
00
superstition. Thus in gambler and prostitute that superstition which arranges the           00
w
figures of fate and fills all wanton behavior with fateful forwardness, fateful
concupiscence, bringing even pleasure to kneel before its throne. <See 0 1 , 1 .>

The father of Surrealism was Dada; its mother was an arcade. Dada, when the
two first met, was already old. At the end of 1 919, Aragon and Breton, out of
antipathy to Montparnasse and Montmartre, transferred the site of their meet­
ings with friends to a cafe in the Passage de l'Opera. Construction of the Boule­
vard Haussmann brought about the demise of the Passage de rOpera. Louis
Aragon devoted 135 pages to tlns arcade; in the sum of these three digits hides
tlle number nine-the number of muses who presided as midwives at the birth of
Surrealism. These stalwart muses are named Ballhorn, Lenin, Luna, Freud,
Mors, Marlitt, and Citroen. A provident reader will make way for them all, as
discreetly as possible, wherever they are encountered in the course of these lines.
In Paysan de Paris, Aragon conducts as touching a requiem for this arcade as any
man has ever conducted for the mother of his son. It is there to be read, but here
one should expect no more than a physiology and, to be blunt, an autopsy of
these parts of the capital city of Europe, parts that could not be more mysterious
or more dead. <See Cl,3.>                                                       <h' , 1 >


The Copenncan revolution in historical perception is as follows. Formerly it was
thought tlmt a fixed point had been found in "what has been;' and one saw the
present engaged in tentatively concentrating the forces of knowledge on this
ground. Now this relation is to be overturned, and what has been is to acquire its
dialectical fixation tllrough the synthesis which awakening achieves with the
opposing dream inmges. Politics attains prinlacy over lnstory. Indeed, historical
"facts" becOlne sOlnething that just now happened to us, just now struck us: to
establish them is the affair of memory. And awakening is the great exemplar of
memory-that occasion on which we succeed in remenlbering what is nearest,
most obvious (in the "I"). What Proust intends with the experimental rearrange­
ment of furniture, what Bloch recognizes as the darkness of the lived moment, is
nothing otl,er than what here is secured on the level of the lnstorical, and collec­
tively. There is a not-yet-conseious knowledge of what has been: its advancement
has tl,e structure of awakening. <See Kl,2.>                                    <h',2>


In this historical and collective process of fixation, colleeting plays a certain role.
Collecting is a fonn of practical memory, and of all tl,e profane matnfestations of
the penetration of " what has been" (of all the profane 111anifestations of "near­
ness") it is the most binding. Thus, in a certain sense, the smallest act of political
reflection makes for an epoch in the antiques business. We construct here an
alarm clock that rouses the kitsch of the previous eentury to "assemblY:' This
genuine liberation from an epoch has the stmcturc of awakening in the following
respect as well: it is entirely ruled by cunning." For awakening operates with
cuurring. Only witll cmuring, not without it, can we work free of tile realm of
dream. But there is also a false liberation, whose sign is violence. Here, too, that
law prevails by which the exertion brings about its opposite. This fmitless exer­
tion is represented, for the period in question here, byJugendstil. <See Hla,2 and
Gl,7.>                                                                       <h",3>


Dialectical stmcture of awakening: remembering and awiling are most inti­
mately related. Awakening is namely the dialectical, Copernican turn of remem­
brance <Eingedenken>. It is an eminently composed reversal from the world of
dreaming to the world of wiling. For the dialectical schematism at the core of
this physiological process, the Chinese have found, in their fairy tales and novel­
las, the most radical expression. The new, dialectical method of doing history
teaches us to pass in spirit-with the rapidity and intensity of dreams-tlrrough
what has been, in order to experience the present as waking world, a world to
which every dream at last refers. <See Kl,3.>                                <h",4>


These notes devoted to the Paris arcades were begun under an open sky of
cloudless blue that arched above the foliage and yet was dimmed by the millions
of leaves from which the fresh breeze of diligence, the stertorous breath of re­
search, the storm of youthful zeal, and the idle wind of curiosity have raised the
dust of centuries. The painted sky of summer that looks down from the arcades
in the reading room of the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris has stretched its
dreamy, unlit ceiling over the birth of their insight. And when that sky opened to
the eyes of this young insight, there in the foreground were standing not the
divinities of Olympus-not Zeus, Hephaestus, Hermes, or Hera, Artemis, and
Athena-but the Dioscuri." <See Nl,S.>                                        <h",5>
The Ring of Saturn
or
Some Remarks on Iron Construction


According to Gretel Adorno, this text (Gesammelte Schrjften, vol. 5 [Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1982],
pp. 1060�1063) was "one of the [ust pieces Benjamin read to us in <1929 in> Konigstein" (cited in
Gesammelte Schrffrell) vol. 5, p. 1350). Benjamin himself filed the text at the begimung of Convolute
G. Rolf Ticdemrull suggests that it may have been intended as a radio broadcast for young people,
but thinks it more likely to have been a newspaper or magazine article that was never published. TIle
piece was written in 1928 or 1929.



The beginning of the nineteenth century witnessed those initial experiments in
iron construction whose results, in conjunction with those obtained frolll experi­
ments with the steam engine, would so thoroughly transform the face of Europe
by the end of the century. Rather than attempt a historical account of this proc­
ess, we would like to focus SOme scattered reflections on a small vignette which
has been extracted from the middle of the century (as from the middle of the
thick book that contains it), and which indicates, although in grotesque style,
what limitless possibilities were seen revealed by construction in iron. The picture
comes from a work of 1844-Grandville's Another World-and illustrates the
adventures of a fantastic little hobgoblin who is trying to find his way around
outer space: ''A bridge-its two ends could not be embraced at a single glance
and its piers were resting on planets-led from one world to another by a cause­
way of wonderfully smooth asphalt. The three-hundred-tlnrty-three-thousandth
pier rested on Saturn. There our goblin noticed tllat the ring around this planet
was notlnng other than a circular balcony on which tlle inhabitants of Saturn
strolled in the evening to get a breatll of fresh air:'

Gas candelabra appear in our picture as well. They could not be overlooked, in
those days, when speaking of the achievements of technology. Whereas for us
gas lighting often has about it something dismal arid oppressive, in that age it
represented the height of luxury and splendor. When Napoleon was interred in
the church of Les Invalides, the scene lacked nothing: in addition to velvet, silk,
gold and silver, and wreaths of the inmlOrtals, there was an eternal lamp of gas
over the resting place. An engineer in Lancaster had invented a device that
people regarded as a veritable miracle-a mechatnsm by which the church clock
over the tomb was automatically illuminated by gaslight at dusk and by winch
the flanles were automatically extinguished at daybreak.
For the rest, people were accustomed to seeing gas in cOl�unction with cast iron
at those elegant establishments that were just then starting to appear: the arcades.
The leading fancy-goods stores, the chic restaurants, the best confectioners, and
so on found it necessary to secure a place in these galleries in order to presenre
their reputations. Out of these galleries emerged, a little later on, the great depart­
ment stores, of which the pioneering model, Au Bon MarchC, was designed by
the builder of the Eiffel Tower.

Iron construction began with winter gardens and arcades-that is, with genuine
luxury establishments. Very quickly, however, it found its true range of technical
and industrial application. What resulted were constructions that had no prece­
dent and that were occasioned by wholly new needs: covered markets, railroad
stations, exhibition halls. Engineers led the way. But poets, as well, displayed
amazing foresight. Thus, the French Romantic Gautier declares: "A proper archi­
tecture will be created the moment we begin making use of the new materials
furnished by the new industry. The advent of cast iron enables and calls for many
new forms, as we can see in railroad tenninals, suspension bridges, and the
arches of winter gardens:' Offenbach's Parisian Lift was the first theatrical piece
to be set in a railroad station. "Railway depots," they used to be called back then;
and they inspired the strangest notions. A decidedly progressive Belgian painter,
Antoine Wiertz, sought permission around midcentury to decorate tl,e halls of
railroad stations with frescoes.

Step by step, the technology of that era took possession of new fields; it did so in
the face of difficulties and objections of which today we can scarcely form a
conception. In the 1830s in England, for example, a bitter controversy arose over
the issue of iron rails. Under no circumstances, it was argued, could enough iron
ever be procured for the English railway system (at that time plal1l1ed on ouly the
smallest scale) . The "steam carriages" would have to nm on lanes of granite.

Alongside the theoretical battles were ongoing practical struggles with materials.
Tbe story of the bridge over the Firth ofTay is an especially memorable exanlple.
Six years were required for the construction of this bridge: 1872 to 1878. And
shortly before its completion, on February 2, 1877, a hurricane (of the particularly
violent sort that assail the inlet of the Tay and that also caused the catastrophe of
1879)1 blew down two of the biggest supporting piers. And not only bridge
construction made such denlands on the patience of engineers ; with turme1s, it
was no clifferent. When, in 1858, plans were afoot for the twelve-kilometer
tul1l1el through Mont Cenis, the estimated length of time for tl,e work was seven
years.

Thus, while in great things heroic efforts were expended on precedent-setting,
groundbreaking achievements, in little matters there was often-strange to say­
something motley. It is as though people, and "artists" in particular, did not quite
dare to acknowledge tlns new material, with all its possibilities. Whereas we
allow our steel furnishings of today to be what they are, shiny and clean, a
hundred years ago men took great pains, by means of subtle coating techniques,
to make it appear that iron furniture-which was already being produced by
then-was crafted from the finest wood. It was at this time that manufacturers
began to stake tlleir reputations on bringing out glasses that looked like porce­
lain, gold jewelry resembling leatller straps, iron tables with the look of wicker­
work, and other such things.


None of these efforts succeeded in covering over the chasm which the develop­
ment of technology had opened up between the builder of the new school and
the artist of the old type. Raging underneath was the battle between the academic
architect, with his concern for stylistic forms, and the engineer, who dealt in
formulas. As late as 1805, a leader of ti,e old school published a work witll the
title: "On the Uselessness of Mathematics for Assuring the Stability of Build­
ings:' 2 When this struggle finally, toward the end of the century, was decided in
favor of the engineers, a reaction set in: an effort to renew art on the basis of
technology's own rim store of forms. This was Jugendstil. At the same tinle,
however, that heroic age of technology found its monument in the incomparable
Eiffel Tower, of which the first historian of iron construction wrote: "Thus, the
plastic shaping power recedes here before a colossal span of spiritual energy. . . .
Every one of the twelve thousand metal fittings, each of the two and a half
million rivets, is machined to the millimeter. . . . On this work site, one hears no
chisel-blow liberatiog form from stone; here, thought reigns over muscle power,
which it transmits via cranes and secure scaffolding.":l

I. Fourier, or the Arcades




Chaque epoque reve la suivante.
�Miche1et, ''Avenir! AvenirJ"


Corresponding to the fonn of the new means of production, which in the begin­
ning is still ruled by the form of the old (Marx), are, in the social superstructure,
wish images in which the new and the old interpenetrate in fantastic fasbion.
TIlls interpenetration derives its fantastic character, above all, from the fact that
what is old in tbe current of social development never clearly stands out from
what is new, while tbe latter, in an effort to disengage from the antiquated,
regeneratcs arcbaic, primordial elements. TI,e utopian images whicb accompany
the emergence of tbe new always, at the same time, reach back to the primal past.
In the dream in which eacb epoch entertains images of its successor, the latter
appears wedded to elements of primal history. The reflections of the base by the
superstructure are therefore inadequate, not because they will have been con�
sciously falsified by the ideologues of tbe ruling class, but because the new, in
order to take the form of an image, constantly unites its elements with those of
the classless society. The collective unconscious has a greater share in them than
the consciousness of the collective. From the fmmer come tbe images of utopia
that have left their trace in a thousand configurations of life, from buildings to
fashions.
These relations are discernible in the utopia conceived by Fourier . . .



. . . In the dream in which each epoch entertains images of its successor, the latter
appears wedded to elements of primal history-that is, to elements of a classless
society. And the experiences of such a society-as stored in the unconscious of the
collective-{never come to rest on the threshold of the most ancient cultures, but
take up elcl11cnts of natural history into their nl0venlcnt. This movement engen­
ders,} engender, in combination with what is new, the utopia that has left its trace
in a thousand configurations of life, from enduring edifices to passing fashions.




HI. Grandville, or the World Exhibition



Fashion: " Madam Death! Madam Death!"
�Leopardi, "Dialogue between Fashion and Death"

World exhibitions propagate the universe of commodities. Grandville's late fan­
tasies confer a commodity character on the universe. They modernize it. Thus)
Saturn's ring becomes a cast-iron balcony on which the inhabitants of Saturn
take the evening ait: The literary counterpart to this graphic utopia is found in
the books of the Fourierist Toussenel. Fashion prescribes the ritual according to
which the commodity fetish demands to be worshipped. Grandville extends the
scope of fashion to objects of everyday use, as well as to the cosmos. In taking it
to an extreme, he reveals its nature, Fashion always stands in opposition to the
organic. Not the body but the corpse is the most perfect object for its art. It
defends the rights of the corpse before the living being, which it couples to the
inorganic world. The fetishism that succumbs to the sex appeal of the commod­
ity is its vital nerve. On the other hand, it is precisely fashion that triumphs over
death. It brings the departed with it into the present. Fashion is contemporary
with every past.
For the world exhibition of 1867, Victor Hugo issues a manifesto . . .




V. Baudelaire, or the Streets of Paris

[1] Baudelaire's genius, in its affinity for spleen and melancholy, is an allegori­
cal genius. "Tout pour rnoi devient allegorie:' Paris as object of allegorical
perception. The allegorical gaze as gaze of the alienated. Flaneur's lack of
participation.
The flaneur as counterpart of the "crowd;' The London crowd in Engels.
The man of the crowd in Poe. The consummate flaneur is a hohemian, a
deracine. He is at home not in his class but only in the crowd-which is to
say, in the city. Excursus on the bohbnien. His role in the secret societies.
Characterization of professional conspirateurs. The end of the old boheme.
Its dissociation into legal opposition and revolutionary opposition.

Baudelaire's ambivalent position. His flight into the asocial. He lives with a
prostitute. (The art theory of {'art pour {'art. It arises from the artist's pre­
monition that he will henceforth be obliged to create for the market.)

The motif of death in Baudelaire's poetry. It merges with his image of Paris.
Excursus on the chthonic side of the city of Paris. Topographic traces of
the prehistoric: the old bed of the Seine. The snbterranean waterways.
The catacombs. Legends of subterranean Paris. Conspirators and commu­
nards in the catacomhs. The undersea world of the arcades. Their impor­
tance for prostitution. Emphasis on the commodity character of the
woman in the market of love. The doll as wish symbol.

The phantasmagoria of the flaneur. The tempo of traffic in Paris. The city as
a landscape and a room. TI,e departulent store as the last promenade for
the flaneur. There his fantasies were materialized. The flanerie that began
as art of the private individual ends today as necessity for the masses.

Art at war with its own co:nmlOdity character. Its capitulation to the co:nmlod­
ity with {'art pour {'art. The birth of the Cesamtkurutwerk from the spirit of
t'artpour ['art. Baudelaire's fascination with Wagner.
[2] Baudelaire's genius, which is nourished on melancholy, is an allegorical
genins. "Tout pour moi devient allegorie." For the first time, with Baude­
laire, Paris becomes the subject of lyric poetry. Not as homeland; rather,
the gaze of the allegorist, as it falls on the city, is the gaze of the alienated
man.

TIle fLilleur is a lnan uprooted. He is at home neither in his class nor in his
homeland, but only in the crowd. The crowd is his element. The London
crowd in Engels. The man of the crowd in Poe. The phantasmagoria of the
flaneur. The crowd as veil through which the familiar city appears trans­
formed. The city as a landscape and a room. The department store is the
last promenade for the flaneur. There his fantasies were materialized.

The flaneur as boMmien. Excursus on the bohlimien. He comes into being at
the same time as the art market. He works for the wide anonymous public
of the bourgeoisie, no longer for the feudal patron. He forms the reserve
army of the bourgeois intelligentsia. His initial efforts on behalf of con­
spirators in the army give way, later, to efforts on behalf of working-class
insurgents. He becomes a professional conspirator. He lacks political
schooling. Uncertainty of class consciousness. "Political" and "social" revo­
lutions. The Communist Manifosto as their death certificate. The boheme dis-
solves into a legal opposition and an anarchist opposition. Baudelaire's am­
bivalent position between the two. His flight into the asocial.
The motif of death in Baudelaire's poetry penetrates the image of Paris. TI,e
"Tableaux parisiens;' the Spleen de Paris. Excursus on the cbthonic side of
the city of Paris. 11,e old bed of the Seine. The subterranean chalmels. Leg­
ends of subterranean Paris. Conspirators and cornmunards in the cata­
combs. Twilight in the catacombs. Their ambiguity. They stand midway
between house and street, between pavilion and hall. The undersea world
of the arcades. Their importance for prostitution. Emphasis on the com·
modity character of the woman in the market of love. The doll as wish
symbol.



Tout pour moi devient Allegorie.
-Baudelaire, "Le Cygne"

Baudelaire's genius, which is nourished on melancholy, is an allegorical genius.
For the first time, with Baudelaire, Paris became the subject of lyric poetry . . .




Facilis descensus Averill.
�Virgil

It is the unique disposition of Baudelaire's poetry that the image of the woman
and the image of death intermingle in a third: that of Paris. The Paris of his
poems is a sunken city, and more submarine than subterranean. It is the city of a
death-franght idyll. Yet the substrate of this idyll is nothing natural, and consists
in neither the subterranean channels of Paris nor its catacombs and the legends
that have grown up around them. It is, rather, a social, and that is to say, a
modern substrate. But precisely the modern, la rnoderniti, is always citing primal
history. Here, this occurs through the ambiguity peculiar to d,e social relations
and products of this epoch. The twilight of the arcades, which contemporaries
compared to an undersea landscape, lies over the society that built d,em. Their
construction itself is ambiguous. They stand midway between house and street,
on the one hand; between pavilion and hall, on the other. At the same time, this
ambiguity set the tone for the market of love. Prostitution, in which the woman
represents merchant and merchandise in one, acquires a particular significance.



Je voyage pour COIlllaltre ma geographie.

The last poem of Les Fleurs du mal: "Le Voyage." The last journey of the flfureur:
death. Its destination: the new. Newness is a quality independent of the use value
of the thing. It is the last word of fashion. It is the semblance that forms the
essence of the images which the dreaming subject of history engenders. The art
that doubts its task must make novelty into its highest value . . .


The press organizes the market in spiritual values, in which initially there is a
boom. Eugene Sue becomes the first celebrity of the fiuilleton. Nonconformists
rebel against the commodity character of art. They rally round the barmer of l 'art
pour l'art. From this watehword derives the eonception of the total work of art,
whieh would seal art off from the further development of technology. The Ce­
JamtkunJiwerk is a premature synthesis, which bears the seeds of death within it.
The solenm rite with whieh it is celebrated is the pendant to the distractions
which surround the apotheosis of the commodity. In their syntheses, both ab­
stract from the social existence of human beings. Baudelaire succumbs to the
rage for Wagner.

. . . increased the financial risks of Haussmannization.
The world exhibition of 1867 marked the high point of the regime and of
Haussmarm's power. Paris is confimled as capital of luxury and of fash­

tions leave intact the framework of domination. For those who are ruled,
it passes the time in which those who rule luxuriate. The insights of

Fais voir, en dejouant la ruse,
o republique, a ces pervers
Ta grande face de Moduse
Au milieu de rouges eclairs.
-Chanson d'ouvriers vel'S 1850


The barricade returns to life during the Commune. It is stronger and better
secured than ever. It stretches across the great boulevards and shields the
trenches behind it. If the Communist Maniftsto ends the age of professional con­
spirators, then the Commune puts an end to the phantasmagoria according to
which the proletariat and its republic are the fulfillment of 1789. This phantasma­
goria conditions the forty years lying between the Lyons insurrection and the
Paris Commune. The bourgeoisie did not share in this eITor . . .
[1] (Balzac was the first to speak of the ruins of the bourgeoisie. But he still
knew nothing about them. It was Surrealism which first got a glimpse of
the field of debris left behind by the capitalist development of d,e forces of
production. )
But it was Surrealism that first opened our eyes to them. These ruins became,
for Surrealism, the object of a research no less inlpassioned than that which the
humanists of the Renaissance conducted on the rellmants of classical antiqnity.
Painters like Picasso and Chirico allude to this analogy. This unrelenting con­
frontation of the recent past with the present moment is something new, histori­
cally. Other contiguous links in the chain of generations have existed within the
collective consciousness, but they were hardly distinguished from one another
within the collective. The present, however, already stands to the recent past as
the awakening stands to the dreanl. The development of the forces of produc­
tiou, in the course of the previous century, shattered that centuris wish synlbols
even before the monuments representing them had collapsed, and before the
paper on which they were rendered had yellowed. In the nineteenth century, this
development of the forces of production worked to emancipate d,e forms of
constnlction from art, just as in the sixteenth century the sciences freed them­
selves from philosophy. A start is made widl architecture as engineered consUUc­
tion. Then comes the reproduction of nature as photography. The creation of
fantasy prepares to become practical as commercial art. Literature submits to
montage in the feuilleton. All these products are on the point of entering the
market as commodities. But dley linger on the threshold. They stop halfway.
Value and commodity enter on a brief engagement before d,e market price
makes their union legitimate. From this epoch derive the arcades and interieurs,
the exhibition halls and panoranlas. They are residues of a dreanl world. But
given d,at the realization of dream elements, in the course of waking up, is the
paradigm of dialectical thinking, it follows that dialectical thinking is d,e organ of
historical awakening. Only dialectical thinking is equal to the recent past, because
it is, each time, its offspring. Every epoch, in fact, not only dreams the one to
follow but, in thus dreaming, precipitates its awakening. It bears its end within
itself and unfolds it-as Hegel already noticed-by cunning. The earliest monu­
ments of the bourgeoisie began to cmmble long ago, but we recognize, for the
first time, how they were destined for d,is end from the beginning.

Not-yet-conscious knowledge of what has been. Structure of what-has-been
at this stage. Knowledge of what has been as a becoming aware, one that
has the stmcture of awakening.

Not-yet-conscious knowledge on the part of the collective

All insight to be grasped according to the schema of awakening. And
shouldn't the "not-yet-conscious knowledge" have the structure of dream?

(Dream kitsch
Parisian chronicles)          (the terrifying knock on the door)
the ugliness of the object is the terrifying knock
on the door when we're asleep5

(We fashion an epoch in the history of the antiques trade and construct a
clock by which to tell when objects are ripe for collecting.)

We constmct an awakening theoretically-that is, we imitate, in the realm of
language, the trick that is decisive physiologically in awakening, for awak­
ening operates with cunning. Only with cunning, not without it, can we
work free of the realm of dream.

Awakening is the exemplary case of remembering: the weighty and momen­
tous case, in which we succeed in remembering the nearest (most obvious).

What Proust intends with the experimental rearrangement of furniture is no
different from what Bloch tries to grasp as darkness of the lived moment.

Here the question arises : In what different canonical ways can man behave
(the individual man, but also the collective) with regard to dreanling? And
what sort of comportment, at bottom, is adequate to tme waking being?

We conceive the dream (1) as historical phenomenon, (2) as collective phe­
nomenon.

Efforts <?> to shed light on the dreams of the individual with the help of the
doctrine of the historical dreams of the collective.
(We teach that, in the stratification of the dream, reality never simply is, but
rather dmt it strikes the dreamer. And I treat of the arcades precisely as
though, at hottom, they were something that has happened to me)
We have to wake up from the existence of our parents. In this awakening, we
have to give an account of the nearness of that existence. Obedience as
category of nearness in religious education. Collecting as profane category
of nearness; the collector interprets dreams of the collective.
Freud's doctrine of the drean1 as a phenomenon of nature. Drean1 as histori­
cal phenomenon.
Opposition to Aragon: to work through all this by way of the dialectics of
awakening, and not: to be lulled, through exhaustion, into "dream" or I\my_
thology!' What are the sounds of the awakening morning we have drawn
into our dreams? "Ugliness," the "old-fashioned" are merely distorted
morning voices that talk of our childhood.

Thesis and antithesis are to be drawn together into the dream-variation­
image < Traurn-Wandel-Bild>. The aspects of splendor and misery attaching
to the arcades are dream vision. The dialectical reversal in synthesis is
awakening. Its mechanism. How we free ourselves from the world of our
parents dlrough cunning. Antinomy of the sentimental. On the hallucina­
tory function of architecture. Dream images that rise up into the waking

No. 198

{The merit of this little volume lies in the evocation of the different districts
of a great city. It is not their picturesque aspect that concerns the author,
nor anything exterior. It is, rather, the unique character conferred on each
of these quartiers by the social strata informing them and the occupations
of the residents.}

If the speculative phenomena attendant on "Haussmannization" remain for
the most part in shadow, the tactical interests of the reform-interests
which Napoleon III willingly concealed behind his impel�al ambitions­
emerge more clearly. A contemporary apology for Haussmann's project is
comparatively frank on this subject. It commends the new streets for "not
subserving the customary tactics of the local insurrections." Before this,
Paris had already been paved in wood so as to deprive the revolution of its
building material. As Karl Gutzkow writes in his Pariser Bri'!ftn, "no one
builds barricades out of blocks of wood." To appreciate what is meant by
this, recall that in 1830 some six thousand barricades were counted in the
city.

Louis Philippe already had the nickname "Roi-Ma�on" <Mason King>. With
Napoleon III, the mercantile, hygienic, and military forces bent on trans­
forming tl,e city's image were allied with the aspiration to immortalize
<oneself> in monuments of lasting peace. In Haussmann he <x> found the
energy necessary for implementation of the plan. Putting the energy to
work was, of course, not easy for him.

The response ofIII: The dialectical image
The uncommon ephemerality of the genuine historical object (flame) com­
pared with ti,e fixity of the philological object. Where the text is itself the
absolute historical object-as in theology-it holds fast to the moment of
extreme ephemerality in the character of a "revelation."
The idea of a history of humanity as idea of the sacred text. In fact, the his-
tory of humanity-as prophecy-has, at all times, been read out of the sa­

Materials for "Arcades"




Among Benjamin's papers are the following materials, consisting of typewritten sheets with addi­
tions in his own and in Franz Hessel's hand. These notes and sketches (Gesammelte Schrjflen! vol. 5
[Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1982], pp. 1341-1347) evidently relate to the abortive collaboration with
Hessel on the arcades. Typewritten text is printed here in italics; Benjamin's longhand notations, in
underlined italics; and Hessel's longhand notations, in roman type. Passages that are crossed out in
the manuscript are in curved brackets ( } here.

Dialectics at a Standstill
Approaches to the Passagen-Werk.


By Rolf Tiedemann




There are books whose fate has been settled long before they even exist as books.
Benjamin's unfinished paJsagen-Werk is just such a case, Many legends have been woven
around it since Adorno first mentioned it in an essay published in 1950.1 Those legends
becalne even more complexly embroidered after a two-volume selection of Benjamin's
letters appeared, which abounded in statements about his intentions for the project. But
these statements were neither complete nor cohercnt.2 As a result, the most contradictory
rumors spread about a book that competing Benjamin interpreters persistently referred to
in the hope that it would solve the puzzles raised by his intellectual physiognomy. 111a1:
hope has remained um"ealized. The answer that the fraglnents of the Passagen-Werk. give to
its readers instead follows Mephisto's retort, "Many a riddle is made here," with Faust's
I�Many a riddle must be solved here."
In fact, for some years the texts that provide the most reliable information about the
project Benjamin worked on for thirteen years, from 1927 until his death in 1940, and
that he regarded as his masterpiece, have been available. Most of dle more important
texts he wrote during the last decade of his life are offshoots of the Passagen-Werk., If it had
been completed, it would have become nothing less than a materialist philosophy of the
history of dle nineteenth century. The expose entitled "PariSI the Capital of the Nine­
teenth CenL1Jry" (1935) provides us with a summary of the themes and motifs Benjamin
was concerned with in the larger work. TIle text introduces the concept of "historical
schematism" (5:1150),3 which was to serve as the basic plan for Benjamin's constmction
of the nineteenth century. On the other hand, "Das Kunstwerk lin Zeitalter seiner techni­
schen Reproduzierbarkeit" (The Work of Art in the Age of Technological Reproducibil­
ity;   1935-1936) has no thematic connection with the Passagen-Werk (dealing with
phenomena belonging to the twentieth rather than to the nineteenth century) , but is
nevertheless relevant from dle point of view of methodology. In that essay, Benjamin tries
to "pinpoint the precise spot in the present my historical construction would take as its
vanishing point' (Letters, 509), '"Dle greatl fragmentary work on Baudelaire, which came
into being in the years 1937-1939, offers a "miniature model" of The Arcades Prqject, TIle
methodological problems raised by the "Work of Art" essay were, in their turn, addressed
once more in the theses I�Ober den BegrifI der Geschichte" (On the Concept of History) .
In Adorno's opinion, dlese theses "more or less summarize the epistemological considera­
tions that developed concurrently with The Arcades Prqject."4 vVhat survives of this proj­
ect-the countless notes and excerpts that constitute the fifth volume of Benjaminls

Notes for tllis essay begin on page 1012.
Gesannnelte Schriften rarely go theoretically beyond positions that have been formulated

more radically in the texts mentioned above. Any study of the Passagen-Werk (Benjamin's
intentions hardly lay themselves open to a simple penlsal) must therefore deal with the
"Work of Art" essay, the texts devoted to Baudelaire, and the theses "On the Concept of
History." 111ese must always be present to the student's mind, even though they are
manifestly autonomous-writings either introductory to the Passagen-Werk or distinct
from it.
The published volumes of the Passagen- Werk begin with two texts in which Benjamin
presents the project in summary, first in 1935 and again in 1939. Together with the early
essay "Der Saturnring, oder Etwas vom Eisenbau" (The Ring of Saturn, or Some Re­
marks on Iron Constluction), these texts are the only ones belonging to the Arcades
complex that may be said to be complete. They were not, however, intended for publica­
tion. The earlier, German one was written for the Institut fUr Sozialforschung, which, as a
result, accepted the Passagen-Werk as one of its sponsored research projects. The other
text, written in French, came into being at Max Horkheimer's instigation: Horkheimer
hoped to make use of it to interest an American patron in Benjamin. TIle most important
part, as well as the lengthiest section, of Volume 5 of the Gesammelte Schrifien consists of
the manuscript of the "Aufzeichnungen und Materialien" (Notes and Materials; here
called the "Convolutes"), which is subdivided thematically. This is dIe manuscript that
had been hidden in the Bibliotheque Nationale during World War II.
Benjamin probably worked on this manuscript from the fall or winter of 1928 until the
end of 1929, and then again from the beginning of 1934. The last entries were made in
the spring of 1940, immediately before Bel�amin fled Paris. The present order of the
notes does not correspond to the order in which they were Oliginally composed. It seems
that Benjamin would begin a new convolute, or sheaf of notes, whenever a new theme
suggested itself and demanded to be h·eated. Within the different sheafs that were com­
posed simultaneously, the notes may evince the chronological order in which they were
written down. Yet even this chronology is not always identical with that of the notes'
actual conception. At the beginnings of those rubrics that had guided his research in its
earliest stage, we find notes Benjamin incorporated from older manuscripts. Here the
notes have been rearranged, and therefore the first pages of the respective collections of
material follow certain clear principles. By contrast, rubrics either added to or newly
begun from 1934 onward generally owe their order to the coincidences of Benjamin's
studies or, even more so, to his reading.5
The section "Erste Notizen" (5:991-1038), here called "First Sketches," consists of
consecutive notes that were begun about the middle of 1927 and terminated in December
1929 or, at the latest, by the beginning of 1930. "'-n1ey are published in their entirety, even
dlOugh their contents have for the most part been incorporated into the larger "Convo­
lutes" section. It is only with their help that we can trace the "transformation process" that
determined the transition from the lint stage of the work to the second. The first of the
"Friihe Entwiirfe" (Early Drafts) entitled "Passagen" (Arcades), dates back to the very
first phase of the work, mid-1927, when Ber�amin intended to collaborate with Franz
Hessel on ajournal article. The draft may well have been written by Bel�amin and Hessel
together. "Pariser Passagen II" (here called "The Arcades of Paris") shows Benjamin's
attempts in 1928 and 1929 to write the essay he thought the PasJagen-Werk would be­
come. Benjamin wrote these texts in a format totally unusual for him and on very
expensive handmade paper, which he never used before or after. One can easily imagine
that he approached their composition as he would a festive occasion. But he did not get
very far. The discrete texts, whose sequence he did not establish, are soon interspersed
with and finally overgrown by quotations and bibliographic notes, and in places with
commentary. Both the "Convolutes" and the "First Sketches" are published in extenso as
they are found in the manuscript, but "The ATcades of Paris" is treated in a different
manner. TIle notes and quotations in this manuscript were never really worked out: they
must have either been transferred to the "Convolutes" or been discarded. They have
therefore not been included in this edition. Only fully fonnulated texts have been publish­
ed; their order has been established by the editor. These texts, among the most important
and, in may say so, the most beautiful of Benjamin's texts, surface again at vaTious places
in the "Convolutes." Published as a whole, however, they convey an impression of the
essay Benjamin mulled over but never actually wrote. The last text, "The Ring of Saturn,
or Some Remarks on Iron Construction," also belongs to the first phase of his project. It
may, in fact, be a jounlal or newspaper article, an offshoot of the Passagen-Wed which
never made it into print.
'"The fragments of the Passagen-Werk can be compared to the materials used in building
a house, the outline of which has just been marked in the ground or whose foundations
are just being dug. In the two exposes that open the fifth volume of the C(:sammelte
Schrfften, Benjamin sketches broad outlines of the plan as he had envisaged it in 1935 and
in 1939. The five or six sections of each expose should have corresponded to the same
number of chapters in the book or, to continue the analogy, to the five or six floors of the
projected house. Next to the foundations we find the neatly piled excerpts, which would
have been used to constnlct the walls ; Bel�alnil1's own thoughts would have provided the
mortar to hold the building together. The reader now possesses many of these theoretical
and interpretive reflections, yet ill the end they almost seem to vanish beneath the very
weight of the excerpts. It is tempting to question the sense of publishing these oppressive
chunks of quotations-whether it would not be best to publish only those texts written by
Benjamin himself. These texts could have been easily arranged in a readable format, and
they would have yielded a poignant collection of sparkling aphorisms and disturbing
fragments. But this would have made it impossible to guess at the pluject attempted in the
Passagen-Werk, such as the reader can discern it behind these quotations. BeI�amin's
intention was to bring together theory and materials, quotations and interpretation, in a
new constellation compared to contemporary methods of representation. '"nle quotations
and the materials would bear the full weight of the project; theory and interpretation
would have to withdraw in an ascetic manner. Bel�31nin isolated a "central problem of
historical materialism," which he thought he could solve in the Passagell-Werk, n31nely:

In what way is it possible to conjoin a heightened graphicness <Anschaulichkeit> to
the realization of the Marxist method? TIle first stage in this undertaking will be to
carry over the principle of montage into history. That is, to assemble large-scale
constructions out of the smallest 311d most precisely cut components. Indeed, to
discover in the analysis of the small individual moment the crystal of the total event.
(N2,6)6

The components, the structural elements, are the countless quotations, and for dus reason
they carmot be omitted. Once familiar with the architecture of the whole, the reader will
be able to read the excerpts without great difficulty and pinpoint in almost every one that
element which must have fascinated Bel�amin. TIle reader will also be able to specify
wluch function an excerpt would have served in the global construction-how it nugbt
have been able to become a ��crystal" whose sparkling light itself reflects the total event.
The reader will, of course, have to draw on the ability to "interpolate into the infilutesi­
mally small;' as Benjamin defines the imagination in Einbalmstrasse (One-Way Street) '?
For the reader endowed with such an imagination, the dead letters Benjamin collected
from dle holdings of the Bibliotheque Nationale will come to life. Perhaps even the
building Benjamin did not manage to build will delineate itself before the imaginatively
speculative eye in shadowy outlines.
These shadows, which prevent us from making a surveyable, consistent drawing of the
architecture, are often traceable to problems of a philological nature. The fragments,
which are mostly short and often seem to abbreviate a thought, only rarely allow us to
glimpse how Benjamin planned to link them. He would often first write down ideas,
pointed scribbles. It is impossible to detennine whether he plalmed to retain them in the
course of his work. Some theoretical notes contradict each other; others al'e hardly
compatible. Moreover, many of Benjamin's texts are linked with quotations, and the mere
interpretation of those citations cannot always be separated from Benjarnin's mvn posi­
tion. Therefore, to assist the reader in finding his bearings in the labyrinth this volume
presents, I shall briefly sketch the essentials of Benjamin's intentions in his Passagen-Werk,
point out the theoretical nodes of his project, and try to approach explication of some of
its central categories.

The Passagen-Werk is a building with two completely different floor plans, each belonging
to a particular phase of the work. During the first phase, from about mid-1927 to the fall
of 1929, Benjalnin planned to write an essay entitled "PariseI' Passagen: Eine dialektische
Feerie" (paris Arcades: A Dialectical Fairyland).8 His earliest references to it in letters
characterize the project as a continuation of One-Way Street (Letters, 322), though Ben­
jamin meant a continuation less in terms of its aphoristic form than in the specific kind of
concretization he attempted there: "this extreme concreteness which made itself felt there
in some instances-in a children's game, a building, and a situation in life"-should now
be captured "for an epoch" (Letters, 348). BeI�amin's original intention was a philosophi­
cal one and would remain so for all those years: "putting to the test" {die Probe az!/das
ExempeO "to what extent you can be 'concrete' in historical-philosophical contexts" (Let­
ters, 333). He tried to represent the nineteenth century as " commentary on a reality')
(0° ,9), rather than construing it in tlle abstract. We can put together a kind of " catalogue
of themes" from the "First Sketches" about the Passagen-Werk. The catalogue shows us
what the work was supposed to treat at this level: streets and wal'ehouses, panoramas,
world exhibitions, types of lighting, fashion, advertising and prostitution, collectors, the
flaneur and the gambler, boredom. Here the arcades themselves are only one theme
among many. They belong to tllose urban phenomena that appeared in the early nine­
teenth century, witll the emphatic claim of the new, but they have meanwhile lost their
functionality. Benjamin discovered the signaulre of the early modern in the ever more
rapid obsolescence of the inventions and innovations generated by a developing capital­
ism's productive forces. He wanted to recover that feature from the appeal-ances of the
unsightly, intentione recta, the physiognomic way: by showing rags, as a montage of trash
(0°,36). In One-1iVcly Street his thinking had similarly lost itself in the concrete and partiCll­
lar and had tried to wrest his secret directly, without any theoretical mediation. Such a
surrender to singular Being is the distinctive feature of this thinking as such. It is not
affected by the rattling mechanisms of undergraduate philosophy, with its transcendental
tablets of commandments and prohibitions. Rather, it limits itself to the somewhat limit­
less pursuit of a kind of gentle empirical experience" (ftlnjJirie). Like Goethe's Empirie, it
does not deduce tlle essence behind or above the thing-it knows it in the things them­
selves.
'"The Surrealists were the first to discover the material world characteristic of the nine-
teenth century, and in it a specific r!lytllOlogi(� rnod(�rne. It is to that mode1TI mythology that
Aragon devotes the preface to his Paysan de Parify while Breton's Nadja reaches up into its
artificial sky. In his essay "Surrealism,') which he called an "opaque folding screen placed
before the Passagen-Werk" (Letters, 348), Benjamin praised the Surrealists as "the first to
perceive the revolutionary energies that appear in the 'outmoded; in the first iron con­
stnlCtions, the first factory buildings, the earliest photos, the objects that begin to be
extinct, grand pianos in the salon, the dresses of five years ago, fashionable restaurants
when the vogue has begun to ebb from them."g This stratum of material, the alluvium of
the recent past, also pertains to the Passagen-Werk.Just as Aragon, sauntering through the
Passage de POpcra, was pulled by a vagw� de rEves into strange, unglimpsed realms of the
Real, so Benjamin wanted to submerge himself in hitherto ignored and scoDled reaches of
history and to salvage what no One had seen before him.
TIle nearly depopulated aquarium llUlllaiu) as Aragon described the Passage de 1'0pera
in 1927, two years after it had been sacrificed to the completion of the inner circle of
boulevards-the ruins of yesterday, where today's riddles are solved-was mmlatched in
its influence on the Passagen-Werk (see Letters, 488). Benjamin kept quoting the lueur
glauque of Aragon's arcades: the light that objects are immersed in by dreams, a light that
makes them appear strange and vivid at the same time. If the concept of the concrete
formed one pole ofBel�amin's theoretical armature, then the Surrealist theory of dreams
made up the other. TIle divagations of the first Arcades "sketch)) take place in the field of
tension between concretization and the dream. to TIrrough the dream, the early Surrealists
deprived empirical reality of all its power; they maltreated empirical reality and its pur­
posive rational organization as the mere content of dreams whose language can be only
indirectly decoded. By turning tlle optics of the dream toward the waking world, one
could bring to birth the concealed, latent thoughts slumbering in that world's womb.
Bel�amin wanted to proceed similarly with the representation of history, by treating the
nineteenth-century world of things as if it were a world of dreamed things. Under capital­
ist relationships of production, history could be likened to the unconscious actions of the
dreaming individual, at least insofar as history is man-made, yet without consciousness or
design, as if in a dream. "In order to understand the arcades from the ground up, we sink
them into the deepest stratum of the dream" (FO,34). If the dreanl model is applied to the
nineteenth century, then it will strip the era of its completeness, of that aspect that is gone
forever, of what has literally become history. TIle means of production and way of life
dominant in tllat period were not only what they had been in their tiTne and place;
Bel�alnin also saw the image-making imagination of a collective unconscious at work in
them. TImt imagination went beyond its historical limits in the dream and actually
touched the present, by transferring "the thoroughly fluctuating situation of a conscious­
ness each time manifoldly divided between waking and sleeping," which he had discov­
ered in psychoanalysis, "from the individual to the collective" (Go,27). Bel�aInin wanted
to draw attention to the fact that architectonic constructions such as the aI'Cades owed
their existence to and served the industrial order of production, while at the same time
containing in themselves somedung unfulfilled, never to be fulfil ed within the confines of
capitalism-in tius case, the glass arclutecture of the future Benjamin often alludes to.
��Each epoch" has a "side turned toward dreaIlls, the cluld's side" (F°,7). The scrutiny this
side of history was subjected to in Benjamin's observation was designed to "liberate tile
enormous energles of lustory . . . that are slumbering in the �once upon a time' of classical
historical narrative" (0°,71).
Almost concurrently with his first notes for tlle Passagen- WerkJ Benjamin included in
Ius \'vritings many protocols of Ius own dreams ; tlus was also when he began to experi-
ment with dmgs. Both represented attempts to break the fixations and the encmstations
in which thinking and its object, subject and object, have been frozen under the pressure
of industrial productionY In dreams as in narcotic intoxication, Benjamin watched "a
world of particular secret affinities" reveal itself, a world in which things enter into lIthe
most contradictory communication" and in which they could display Ilindefinite affini­
ties" (A°,4-5). Intoxication and the dream seemed to urllock a realm of experiences in
which the Id still communicated mimetically and corporeally with things. Ever since his
earlier philosophical explorations, Benjamin sought a concept of experience that would
explode the limitations set by Kallt and regain "the fullness of the concept of experience
held by earlier philosophers," which should restore the experiences of theology.12 But the
experiences of the Surrealists taught him that it was a matter not of restoring theological
experience but of transporting it into the profane:

These experiences are by no means limited to dreams, hours of hashish eating or
opium smoking, It is a cardinal error to believe that, of "Surrealist experiences;' we
know only the religious ecstasies or the ecstasies of dnlgs . . . . But the uue, creative
overcoming of religious illumination certainly does not lie in narcotics. It resides in a
prqfone illumination, a materialistic, anthropological inspiration to which hashish,
opium, or whatever else can give a preliminary lesson. (SUI, 2:208-209)

Benjamin wanted to carry such profane illuminations into history by acting as an inter­
preter of the dreallls of the nineteenth-century world of things. The epistemic intention
manifest here seems to fit in vvith the context of Benjalnin's soon-to-be-formulated theory
of mimetic ability, which is, at its core, a theory of experience. 13 The dleory holds that
experience rests on the ability to produce and perceive similarities-an ability dlat under­
went significallt change in the course of species history. In the begimling a sensuous,
qualitative type of behavior of mcn toward things, it later transformed itself phylogeneti­
cally into a faculty for apperceiving nonsensuous similarities, which Benjamin identified
as the achievements of lallguage and writing, Vis-a.-vis abstracting cognition, his concept
of experience wanted to maintain immediate contact -widl mimetic behavior. He was
concerned about "palpable knowledge" (gifiihltes Wissen), which "not only feeds on the
sensory data taking shape before his eyes, but Call very well possess itself of abstract
knowledge-indeed, of dead facts-as something experienced and lived through" (eO,I),
Images take the place of concepts-the enigmatic and vexing dre<uu images which hide all
that falls through the coarse mesh of semiotics-and yet dlose images alone balance the
exertions of cognition, The nineteenth-century language of images represents that cen­
tury's "deepest level of slcep" (Go,27)-a sleep that should be awakened by the Passagen­
Werk.
Benjamin knew that tIns motif of awakening separated him fro111 the Surrealists, They
had tried to abolish the line of demarcation between life and art, to shut off poetry in
order to live writing or write life. For the eaTly Surrealists, both dream and reality would
unravel to a dreamed, um-eal Reality, from which no way led back to contemporary
praxis and its demands. Bel�annn criticized Aragon for "persisting within the realm of
dreams" alld for allowing mythology to I'remain" -with him (HO,l7). Aragon's mythology
remains mere mythology, unpenetrated by reason, Surrealist imagery evens out the differ­
ences separating Now from Then; instead of bringing the past into the present, it drives
Ilthings back into the distance again" and remains bound, Ilin the historical sphere, [to] a
romantic distance" (CO,S). Benjamin, on the odler hand, wanted "to [bring] things near,"
to allow them to "step into our lives" (1°,2). What linked his methods to Surrealist ones,
the immersion of what has been into layers of dreams, represented not an end in itself for
the Passagen- mrkJ but rather its methodological anangemel1t, a kind of experimental
setup, The nineteenth century is the dream we must wake up from; it is a nightmare that
will weigh on the present as long as its spell remains unbroken. According to Benjannl1,
the images of dreaming and awakening from the dream are related as expression is related
to interpretation. He hoped that the images, once interpreted, would dissolve the spelL
Be� annn's concept of awakening means the "genuine liberation from an epoch" (hO,3), in
the double sense of Hegel's Alifhebung: the nineteenth century would be transcended in
that it would be preserved, "rescued" for the present. Benjamin defines "the new, the
dialectical method of doing history" in these words: "with the intensity of a dreaIn, to pass
through what has been (dar Geweselle), in order to experience the present as the waking
world to which the dream refers" (F°,6). TIlls concept is based on a mystical conception of
Instory that Benjamin was never to abandon, not even in his late theses "On the Concept
of History?' Every present ought to be synchronic with certain moments of history, just as
every past becomes "legible" only in a certain epoch-"namely, the one in which human­
ity, nlbbing its eyes, recognizes just this particular dream unage as such. It is at this
moment that the historian takes up , , . the task of dream interpretation" (N4,1), Tow3Td
this end, we need not a dragging of the past UltO the mythological, but, on the contrary, a
"dissolution of 'mythology' Ul the space of history" (H°,l7). Benjamin demanded a "con­
crete, materialist meditation on what is nearest" (das Ndc/zste); he was interested "only in
the presentation of what relates to us, what conditions us" (CO ,5). In this way the Instorian
should no longer try to enter the past; radler, he should allow the past to enter his life. A
"pathos of nearness" should replace the vanishing "empathy" (1°,2). For the historian,
past objects and events would not then be fixed data, an unchangeable given, because
dialectical thinking "ransacks them, revolutionizes them, turns them upside down"
(D°,4); this is what must be accomplished by awakening from the dream of the nineteenth
century. That is why for Bel�amin the "effort to awaken from a dream" represents "the
best example of dialectical reversal" (D°,7),
TIle key to what may have been Benjamin's intention while working on the first phase
of the PasJtlgen-Werk may be found Ul the sentence, "Capitalism was a natural phenome­
non with which a new dream-filled sleep came over Europe, and, through it, a reactivation
of mytincal forces" (KIa,8), Benjamin shares his project the desire to ulVestigate capital­
)
ism, with historical materialism, from which he may well have appropriated the project in
the [rrst place. But the concepts he uses to define capitalism-nature, dream, and myth­
originate from the terminology of his ovvI1 metaphysically and theologically inspired
thought. 'nle key concepts of the young Benjamin's philosophy of history center around
a critique of myth as the ordained heteronomous which kept man banished Ul dumb
)
dependence throughout prehistory aIld which has since survived in the most dissimilar
forms, both as unmediated violence and in bourgeois jurisprudence. H The critique of
capitalism in the first Arcades sketch remaulS a critique of myth, sUlCe in it the nineteenth
century appears as a domain where "only madness has reigned until now." "But )) Ben­
)
jannll adds, "every ground must at some point have been turned over by reason, must
have been cleared of the undergrowth of delusion and myth. This is to be accomplished
here for the tenain of the nineteenth century" (Go,13). His interpretation recognizes
forms still unlnstorical, still unprisoned by myth, forms that are only preparing dlem­
selves, in such an interpretation, to awaken from myth and to take away its power.
Benjamin identifies them as the dominant forms of consciousness and the imagery of
incipient high capitalism: the "sensation of the newest and most modern,)) as well as the
image of the "eternal retmn of the same"-both are "dream formations of events,"
dreamed by a collective that "knows no history" (MO,14). He speaks in direct theological
terms in his interpretation of the modern as "the time of hell" :

What matters here is that the face of the world, the colossal head, precisely in what
is newest never itself changes-that this "newesC' remains in all respects the same.
This constitutes the eternity of hell and the sadisCs delight in irmovation. To deter­
mine the totality of traits which derme this " modernity" is to represent hell, (Go,17)

Since it is a " commentary on a reality," which sinks into the historical and interprets it as
it would a text, theology was called upon to provide the "scientific mainstay" of the
Passagen-Werk (0°,9), though at the same time politics was to retain its " primacy over
history" (hO ,2). At the time of the first Arcades sketch, Benjamin was concerned less with a
mediation of theological and political categories than with their identity. In this he was
very much like Emst Bloch in Geist der Utopie (Spirit of Utopia), which he explicitly took
as his model. He repeatedly had recourse to Blochian concepts to characterize his own
intentions, as in " fashion inheres in the darkness of dle lived moment, but in the collective
darkness" (O°,ll). Just as for Bloch the experiencing individual has not yet achieved
mastery over himself at the moment of experiencing, for Benjamin the historical phenom­
ena remain opaque, unilluminated for the dreaming collective. In Bloch's opinion, indi­
vidual experience is always experience of the immediate past; in the same way,
Ber�arnin's interpretation of the present refers to the recent past: action in the present
means awakening from the dream of history, an " explosion" of what has been, a revolu­
tionary Ulrn. He was convinced that " the whole set of issues with which this project is
concerned" would be "illuminated in the process of the proletariaes becoming conscious
of itself" (0° ,68). He did not hesitate to interpret these facts as part of the preparation for
the proletarian revolution. "The dialectical penetration and aCUlalization of former con­
texts puts the truth of all present action to the test" (0°,5). It is not the action itself but its
theory that is at stake here. TIus defines the task of the historian as " rescuing" the past or,
as BeI�amin formulated it with another concept taken from Bloch, "awakening a not-yet­
conscious knowledge of what has been)) (H°,17) by applying the "theory of not-yet­
conscious knowing . . . to the collective in its various epochs" (0°,50). At this stage,
Bel�a111in conceived of the Passagen-Werk as a mystical reconstitution: dialectical thinking
had the task of separating the future-laden, "positive" element from the backward "nega­
tive" element, after which I'a new partition had to be applied to this initially excluded,
negative component so that, by a displacement of the angle of vision . . . , a positive
element emerges anew in it too-something different from that previously signified. And
so on, ad infinitum, until the entire past is brought into the present in a historical apocatas­
tasis" (Nla,3). In this way, the nineteenth century should be brought into the present
within the Passagen-l#rk. Bel�amin did not think revolutionary praxis should be allowed
at any lesser price. For him revolution was, in its lughest fonn, a liberation of the past,
which had to demonstrate " the indestructibility of the highest life in all things" (0°,1). At
the end of the 1920s, theology and communism converged in Benjal1un's thought. TIle
metaphysical, lustorical-philosophical, and theological sources that had nurtured both his
esoteric early writings and his great aesthetic works until Ui:prung des deutJcllell Trauer­
sjJie/s (Origin of the German Trauerspiel) were still flowing and would also nurture dle
Passagen-Werk.

'"TIle Passagen-Werk was supposed to become all of that, and it becaIne none of that-to
echo a famous phrase of Bel�amin's (DO,6). He intclTupted work in the fall of 1929 for
various reasons. Retrospectively, he placed responsibility on problems of representation:
the "rhapsodic nature" of the work, which he had already announced in the first sketch's
subtitle, "a dialectical fairyland" (Letters, 488). "'The " illicit 'poeticm fonnulation he then
thought he was obliged to use was irreconcilable with a book that was to have "our
generation's decisive historical interests as its object" (Scholem Letters 165). Benjamin
)
believed that only historical materialism could safeguard those interests; the aporias he
encountered while composing the Passagen-Werk) then, undoubtedly culminated in the
project's position in relation to Marxist theory. Though Benjamin professed his commit­
ment to Communist party politics to begin with, he still had to convince himself of the
necessity to proceed from a political creed to the theoretical study of Marxism, which he
thought could be appropriated for his purposes even prior to his actual study. His inten­
tion was to secure the Passagen-Werk "against all objections . . . provoked by metaphys­
ics " ; "the whole mass of thought, originally set into motion by metaphysics;' had to be
subjected to a "recasting process" which would allow tlle author to "face with equanimity
the objects orthodox Marxism might mobilize against the method of the work" (Letters,
489). Benjamin traced the end of his "blithely archaic philosophizing, inlprisoned by
nature," which had been the basis of the "romantic form" and the "rhapsodic naivete" of
the first sketch, to conversations with Adorno and Horkheimer that he characterized as
"historic" (Letters, 488-489). These took place in September or October 1929, in Frank­
lint and Konigstein. In all probabilily, both Horkheimer and Adorno insisted in dis­
cussions of the submitted texts-mainly the "Early Drafts" published with the
Passagen- Werl{-that it was iInpossible to speak sensibly about the nineteenth century
without considering Marx's analysis of capital; it is entirely possible that Benjamin, who
at that time had read hardly anything by Marx, was influenced by such a suggestion. is Be
that as it may, Benjamin's letter to Scholem ofJanuary 20, 1930, contains tlle statement
that he would have to study certain features of both Hegelian philosophy and Capital in
order to complete his project (Letters, 359). Ber�amin had by no means concluded such
studies when he returned to the Passagen-Werk four years later. The "new face" (5:1103)
the work unveiled, due not a little to Benjamin's political experiences in exile, revealed
itself in an emphatic recourse to social history, which had not been wholly relinquished in
the first sketch but which had been concealed by that sketch's surrealist intentions. None
of the old motifs were abandoned, but the building was given stronger foundations.
Among the themes added were Haussmann's influence, the struggles on the barricades,
railways, conspiracies, cornpag'll onnage) social movements, the Stock Exchange, economic
history, the Commune, the history of sects, and the Ecole Polytechnique; moreover,
Benjamin began assembling excerpts on Marx, Fourier, and Saint-Simon. This thematic
expansion hardly meant that Benjamin was about to reserve a chapter for each theme (he
now planned to write a book instead of an essay). TIle book's subject was now defIned as
'�the fate of art in the nineteenth century" (Letters, 517) and thus seemed more narrowly
conceived than it had been. '111at should not be taken too literally, however: the 1935
expose, after all, in which Benjamin most clearly delineates his intentions in his work's
second stage, still lists every theme the Passagen-Werk was to treat from the outset: ar­
cades, panoramas, world exhibitions, interiors, and the streets of Paris. This expose's title,
"Paris, the Capital of the Nineteenth Century;' remained the definitive title and was
appropriated for another expose-a French prospectus-in 1939. This prospectus con­
tains a decisive reference to "the new and far-reaching sociological perspectives" of the
second sketch. Bel-Bamln wrote that these new perspectives would yield a "secure frame­
work of interpretive interconnections" (Letters, 490). But his interpretation was now
supposed to trace the book's subject matter-the cultural superstructure of nineteenth-
century France-back to what Marx had called the fetish character of commodities. In
1935 the "unfolding of this concept" would "constitute the center" of the projected work
(Scholem Letters, 159), and by 1938 the "basic categories" of the Passagm-Werk would
"converge in the determination of the fetish character of commodities" (5:1166), This
notion surfaces only once in the first sketch (0°,38) ; it was then by no means clear that
commodity fetishism was destined to form the central schema for the whole project.
"When Benjamin wrote the fiTSt expose in 1935, he was probably still unfamiliar with the
relevant discussion in Marx's writings, He apparently only began to "look around , , , in
the first volume of Capital" after completing the expose (5:1122). He was fmnihar with the
theory of commodity fetishism mainly in Lukac's version; like many other left-wing
intellectuals of his generation, Benjamin largely owed his Marxist competency to the
chapter on reification in Lukacs's Hist01Y and Class Consciousness.
Benjamin wished to treat culture in dle era of high capitalism like Lukac's translation
back into philosophy of the economic fact of commodity fetishism, as well as his applica­
tion of the category of reilication to the antinomies of bourgeois thought. Marx showed
that capitalist production's abstraction of value begets an ideological consciousness, in
which labor's social character is reflected as objective, thing-like characteristics of the
products of that labor. Benjamin recognized the same ideological consciousness at work in
the then-dominant "reified conception of culture:' which obfuscated the fact dlat "the
creations of the human mind . . . owe not just their origin, but also the ways in which they
have been handed down, to a continuing social labor" (5:1255). The fate of nineteenth­
century culture lay precisely in its connllodity character, which Berqamin thereupon
represented in "cultural values" as phantasmagoria. Phantasmagoria: a Blendwerk, a decep­
tive TInage designed to dazzle, is already the commodity itself, in which the exchange
value or value-form hides the usc value. Phantasmagoria is the whole capitalist produc­
tion process, which constitutes itself as a natural force against the people who carry it out.
For Bel�amin, cultural phantasmagorias express "the ambiguity peculial' to the social
relations and products of this epoch" (Expose of 1935, section V). In Marx, the same
ambiguity dermes "the economic world of capitalism": an ambiguity "exemplified quite
clearly in the machines which aggravate exploitation rather than alleviate the human lot"
(1<.3,5), Tbe concept of phantasmagoria that Bel�amin repeatedly employs seems to be
merely another term for what Marx called cOllullodity fetishism, Benjamin's term can
even be found in Marx's writings: in Capitars first chapter (on fetishism), in the famous
passage about the ��definite social relation" which molds labor under capitalist conditions
of production, that very relation is said to "assume . . . the phantasmagoric form of a
relation between things" for the people concerned.lii Marx had in mind the circumstances
of the bourgeois economy's "necessal'ily false" consciousness, which is no less false for
being necessary, Bel�amin's interest in culture was less for its ideological content, how­
ever, whose depth is uneardled TIl ideology critique, than for its surface or exterior, which
is both promising and deceptive, " TIle creations and life-styles that were mainly condi­
tioned by cOIIlmodity production and which we owe to the previous century" are �'sensu­
Dusly transfigured in their immediate presence" (5:1256). Bel�amin was interested in that
immediate presence; the secret he was tracking in the Passag,-en -Werk is a secret that comes
to appear, The "luster with which the commodity-producing society surrounds itself"
(5:1256) is phantasmagorical-a luster that hardly has less to do with the "beautiful
appearance" of idealist aesthetics than with commodity fetishism, Phantasmagorias al'e
the "centuris magic inlages" (1:1153); they are the WztJIschbildClj the wish symbols or
ideals, by which that collective tried "both to overCOIIle and to transfigure the immaturity
of the social product and the inadequacies in the social organization of production"
<D
(Expose of 1935, section I). To begin with, the phantasmagoria seems to have a transfigur­           W
<D
ing function: world exhibitions, for example, transform the exchange value of commodi�
ties by fading, as in a film, from the abstractness of their valuation. Similarly, the collector
transfigures things by divesting them of their commodity character. And in this same way,
iron construction and glass architecture are transfigured in the arcades becallse "the
century could not match the new technical possibilities with a new social order" (5:1257).
AI:. Benjamin in late 1937 came across Auguste BIanqui's L'Eternitipar les astres-a cosmo­
logical phantasmagoria written by the revolutionary while in prison-he reencountered
his own speculation about the nineteenth century as Hades. The semblance character
(Scheinluifle) of all that is new and that the century liked to show off as modern par
excellence was consummated in its highest concept, that of progress, which Blanqui
denounced as a Ilphantasmagoria of history," as "something so old it predates thinking,
which struts about in the clothes of the New," as the etenlal recun-ence of the same, in
which mankind figures lIas one of the danmed" (5:1256). Bel�amin learned from Blanqui
that the phantasmagoria embraced "the most bitter criticism;' the harshest indictment of
society" (5:1256-1257). TIle transfiguring aspects of phantasmagoria change to enlighten­
ment, into the insight "that mankind will remain under the power of mythical fear as long
as phantasmagoria has a place in that fear (5:1256). The century always transcends the
"old social order" in its cultural phantasmagoria. As llwish symbols," the arcades and
interiors, the exhibition halls and panoramas are llresidue of a dream world." They are
part of BIochian dreaming ahead, anticipating the future: IIEvery epoch, in fact, not only
dreams the one to follow, but, in dreaming, precipitates its awakening. It bears it<; end
within itself." Insofar as dialectical thinking tries to define as well as to expedite this end of
decaying bourgeois culture, it became for Bel�amin the llorgan of historical awakening"
(Expose of1935, section VI, end) .
lIThe property appertaining to the commodity as its fetish character attaches as well to
the commodity-producing society-not as it is in itself, to be sure, but more as it repre­
sents itself and thinks to understand itself whenever it abstracts ii'om the fact that it
produces precisely commodities" (X13a). That was hardly Marx's opinion. He identifies
the fetish character of the commodity through the fact that the features of man's labor
ap/Jear to hun as what they are: �Ias material relations betvveen persons and social relations
betvveen things." 17 The analysis of capital establishes the quid pro quo of commodity
fetishism as objective, not as a phantasmagoric. Marx would necessarily have rejected the
notion that the conmlodity-producing society might be able to abstract from the fact that
it produces con'lllOditics in any other way than by really ceasing to produce coml11odities
in the transition to a higher social formation. It is not difficult-though also not very
productive-to point out Bel�amin's miscomprehensions of Marxist theory.
Bel�amin showed little interest in a Marxist theory of art, which he considered Ilone
moment swaggering, and the next scholastic" (N4a,2). He valued three short sentences by
Proust more highly than most of what existed in the field of materialist analysis (K3,4).
TIle majority of Marxist art theorists explain culture as the mere reflection of economic
development; Bel�amin refused to join them. He viewed the docb:ine of aesthetic reflec­
tion as already undercut by Marx's remark tTh'lt lithe ideologies of the superstructure
reflect relations in a false and distorted mam1er." Benjamin followed this remark with a
question:

If the infrastructure in a certain way (in the materials of thought and experience)
determines the superstnlcture, but if such determination is not reducible to simple
reflection, then how should it be characterized'? As its expression. TIle superstnlC-
ture is the expression of the infrastnlCture. The economic conditions under which
society exists are expressed in the superstructure, precisely as, with the sleeper, an
overfull stomach finds not its reflection but its expression in the contents of dreams,
which, from a causal point of view, it may be said to "condition." (K2,5)

BeI�amin did not set out according to ideology critique;18 radler, he gave way to the
notion of materialist physiognomies, which he probably understood as a complement, or
an extension, of Marxist theory. Physiognomies infers the interior from the exterior; it
decodes the whole from the detail; it represents dIe general in the particular. Nominal­
istically speaking, it proceeds from the tangible object; inductively it commences in the
reahn of the intuitive. The Passagen.-Werk "deals fundamentally with the expressive char­
acter of the earliest industrial products, the earliest industrial architecture, the earliest
machines, but also dIe earliest department stores, advertisements, and so on" (Nla,7). In
that expressive character, Benjamin hoped to locate what eluded the immediate grasp: the
Sign.atu}� the mark, of the nineteenth century. He was interested in the "thread of expres­
sion": "the expression of the economy in its culture will be presented, not the economic
origins of culture" (Nla,6). Benjamin's trajectory from the first to the second sketch of the
Passagen-Werk documents his efforts to safeguard his work against the demands of histori­
cal materialism; in this way, motifs belonging to metaphysics and theology survived
undamaged in the physiognomic concept of the epoch's closing stage, 1'0 describe the
expression of economics in culture was an attempt " to grasp an economic process as
perceptible Ur�phenomenon, from out of which proceed all manifestations of life in the
arcades (and, accordingly, in the nineteenth century) " (Nla,6). Benjamin had already
enlisted Goethe's primal phenomenon (UljJilanomenj to explicate his concept of truth in
Orig7.·n if tlte German Trauerspiel:19 the concept of '�origin" in the Trauerspiel book would
have to be " a strict and compelling transfer of this Goethean first principle from the realm
of nature to that of history," In the Passagen-Werk! then:

I am equally concerned with fathoming an origin, To be specific, I pursue the origm
of the forms and mutations of the Paris arcades from their begimring to their decline,
and I locate this origin in the economic facts. Seen from the standpoint of causality,
however (and that means considered as causes), these facts would not be primal
phenomena; they become such only insofa1' as in their own individual develop­
ment-'\mfolding" might be a better term-they give rise to the whole series of the
arcade's concrete historical forms, just as the leaf unfolds from itself all the riches of
the empirical world of plants. (N2a,4)

Metaphysical subtleties and theological niceties reappear here in the theory of epistemol­
ogy, even though they seemed vanquished after they learned of their ironic mlllasking by
economics. How could Ur-phenomena, which represent themselves as the expression of
economic facts, distinguish themselves from those ideas in Benjamin's TrauersjJiel book
which represent themselves by empirical means? Benjamin resolves tlns problem with his
early notion of a monadological truth, winch presides at every phase of the Passagen-Werk
and remains valid even in the theses "On the Concept of History," vVhereas in the
TrauersjJiel book tlle idea as monad l�contains tlle image of the world" in itself,20 in the
Pa,rsagen-Wer/( the expression as [k-phenomenon contains the image of history in itself.
The essence of capitalist production would be comprehended vis-a�vis the concrete his­
torical forms in which the economy finds its cultural expression. TIle abstractions of mere
conceptual tlunking were insufficient to demystify this abhorrent state of affairs, such that
a mimetic-intuitive corrective was imposed to decipher the code of the universal in the
image . Physiognomic thought was assigned the task of "recognizing the monuments of
the bourgeoisie as ruins even before they have crumbled" (Expose of 1935, section VI,
end) .
The prolegomena to a materialist physiognomies that can be gleaned from the Pas­
Jagen.-Werk counts among Benjamin's most prodigious conceptions. It is the program­
matic harbinger of that aesthetic theory which Marxism has not been able to develop to
this day. Whether Benjamin's realization of rus program was capable of fi.llfilling its
promise, whether his physiognomies was equal to its materialist task, could have been
proven only by the actual composition of the PasJagen-JiVerk itself.

Modified concepts of history and of the writing of history are the link between both
ArcadeJ sketches. Their polemical barbs are aimed at the nineteenth-century notion of
progress. "Vith the exception of Schopenhauer (by no coincidence, his objective world
bears the name "phantasmagoria"), idealist philosophers had turned progress into the
"signature of historical process as a whole" (N13)) and by doing so had deprived it of its
critical and enlighteillilent functions. Even Marx's tnlst in the unfolding of the productive
forces hypostatized the concept of progress, and it must have appeal"ed untenable to
Benjamin in light of the experience of the twentieth century. Similarly, the political praxis
of the worker's movement had forgotten that progress in terms of proficiency and infor­
mation does not necessarily mean progress for humanity itself--and that progress in the
domination of nature corresponds to societal regress.21 In the first ArcadeJ sketch Ben­
jamin already demanded "a philosophy of history that at all points has overcome the
ideology of progress" (0°,5), one such as he later worked out in the historical-philosophi­
cal theses. TIlere the image of history reminds the reader more of Ludwig Klages's lethal
juggling with archetypal images (UrbildCl) and phantoms than of the dialectic of the forces
and the relations of production, It is that Angel of History who appears in one of the
theses as an allegory of the historical materialist (in Benjamin's sense)22 and who sees all
history as a catastrophe "which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front
of rus feet" (Illuminations, p. 259). The Angel abolishes all categories which until d,en
have been used for representing history: this materialist sees the "everything 'gradual'
about becoming" as refuted, and "development" is shown to be only "seeming') (1'°,6;
Kl,3). But more than anything else, he denounces the "establishment of a continuity"
(N9a,5) in history) because the only evidence of th:"1t continuity is that of horror, and the
Angel has to do with salvation and redemption. TIle Passagen-JiVerk was supposed to
bring nothing less than a "Copernican revolution" of historical perception (Fo 7 ; K1)1-3),
)
Past history would be grounded in the present, analogous to Kanes epistemological
grounding of objectivity in the depths of the subject. The frrst revolution occuncd in the
relationship in which subject and object, present and past meet in historical perception:

Fonnerly it was thought that a fixed point had been found in "what has been;) and
one saw the present engaged in tentatively concentrating the forces of knowledge on
this ground, Now this relation is to be overturned, and what has been is to become
the dialectical reversal-the irnlption of awakened consciousness. Politics attains
primacy over history. The facts become something that just now first happened to
us, first struck us; to establish them is the affair of memory, (K1,2)

The historical line of vision no longer falls from the present back onto history; instead it
travels from history forward. Be�jamin tried to "recognize today's life, today's forms in
the life and in the appaTently secondary, lost forms" of the nineteenth century (N1,U).
Our contemporary interest in a historical object seems "itself preformed in that object,
and, above ail," it feels "this object concretized in itself and upraised from its fonner being
into the higher concretion of now-being lYe"tseins] (waking being!)" (K2,3). The object of
history goes on changing; it becomes "historical" (in this word's emphatic sense) only
when it becomes topical in a later period. Continuous relationships in tllIle, with which
history deals, are superseded in Benjamin's thought by constellations in which the past
coincides with the present to such an extent that the past achieves a "Now" of its "recog­
nizability:' Benjamin developed this " Now of Recognizability;' which he sometilnes re­
ferred to as his theory of knowledge (5:1148), from a double frontal position against both
idealism and positivistic historicism. VVhile the latter tried to move the historical narrator
back into the past, so that he could comprehend "emphatically" (solely from within) the
whole of the Then, which filled "homogeneous, empty time" as a mere "mass of data"
(Illuminations) p. 264), idealist constructions of history, on the other hand, usurped the
prospect of the future and posited in history the existence of the natural plan of a process,
which runs on autonomously and can, in principle, never be completed. Both relegate
"everything about history that, from the very beginning, has been untimely, sorrowful,
unsuccessful"    ( TrauerJPiel) p 166) to forgetting. TIle object of that materialist historical
.



natrative Benjamin wanted to try out in the Passagen- Werk would be precisely what
history started but did not carry out. That the lineaments of the past are first detectable
after a certain period is not due to the historian's whim; it bespeaks an objective historical
constellation:

History is the object of a construct whose site is not homogeneous, empty time, but
time filled by now-time fJetztzeit]. Thus, to Robespierre ancient Rome was a past
charged with now-time, which he blasted out of the continuum of history. The
French Revolution viewed itself as Rome incanlate. It quoted ancient Rome. (Illumi­
Ilations, p. 263)
Bel�arnin wished to continue along tlus line i n the Passagen-Werk. The present would
provide the text of the book; history, the quotations in that text. "To VVTite history . . .
means to cite history" (Nll,3).
Benjamin's Copernican revolution of historical intuition also (and above all) meant that
the traditional concept of truth was to be turned on its head:

Resolute refusal of the concept of "timeless tnlth" is in order. Nevertheless) truth is
not-as Marxism would have it-a merely contingent function of knowing, but is
bound to a nucleus of time lying hidden witlun the knower and the known alike.
This is so tnle tllat the etenlal, in any case, is far more the ruffle on a dress than
some idea. (N3,2)

The temporal core of history carmot be grasped as really happening, stretching fortll in
the real dimension of time ; ratller it is where evolution halts for a moment, where the
d}Jl.amis of what is happening coagulates into stasis) where time itself is condensed into a
differential, and where a Now identifies itself as the "Now of a particular recognizabiliLy."
In such a Now, "tnlth is charged to the bursting point ·with tune" (N3,1). 11le Now would
have thus shown itself to be the "inmost image" (00,81) of tlle 8Tcades tllemselves , of
fashion, of tlle bourgeois interior-appeaxing as the linage of all that had been, and whose
cognition is tlle pith of the Pas.ragen-Werk. Benjamin invented tlle term "dialectical im­
ages)' for such configurations of the Now and the Then; he defined their content as a
"dialectic at a standstilL" Dialectical image and dialectic at the standstill are, without a
doubt, the central categories of the Passagen-Werk. Their meaning, however, remained
iridescent; it never achieved any terminological consistency.2:� We can distinguish at least
two meanings in Bel�amin's texts; they remain somewhat undivulged, but even so calmot
be brought totally in congruence. Once-in the 1935 expose, which in this regard sum­
marizes dIe motifs of the fint draft-Benjamin localized dialectical liuages as dream and
wish images in the collective subconscious, whose "image-making fantasy, which was
stimulated by the new" should refer back to the " Ut'-past": "In the dreaIIl, in which each
epoch entertains ilnages of its successor, the latter appears wedded to elements of Ur­
history-that is, to elements of a classless society. And the experiences of such a society­
as stored in the unconscious of the collective-engender, through interpenetration with
what is new, the utopia" (Expose of 1935, section I). "'TIle modem is said to quote
[h'-history "by means of the ambiguity peculiar to the social relations and products of this
epoch." In turn, "Ambiguity is the manifest imaging of dialectic, the law of dialectics at a
standstill. This standstill is utopia, and the dialectical image, therefore, dream image. Such
an image is afforded by the commodity per se: as fetish" (Expose of 1935, section V),
TIIese statements drew the resolute criticism o f Adorno, who could not concede that the
dialectical image could be "the way in which fetishism is conceived in the collective
consciousness;' since conunodity fetishism is not a ((fact of consciousness" (Letters, 495).
Under the influence of AdOlTIO's objections, BeI�amin abandoned such lliles of thought;
the corresponding passages in his 1939 expose were dropped as no longer satisfactory to
their author (see 5: 1 1 57). By 1 940, in the theses "On the Concept of History," "dialectic
at a standstill') seems to function almost like a heuristic principle, a procedure that enables
the historical materialist to maneuver his objects:

A historical materialist cannot do without the notion of a present which is not a
transition) but in which time stands still and has come to a stop. For this notion
defines the present in which he himself is vvriting history, . . . Materialist historiogra­
phy , . , is based on a constructive principle. Thinking involves not only the flow of
thoughts, but their arrest as welL "Where thilIking suddenly stops in a configuration
pregnant with tensions, it gives that configuration a shock, by which it crystallizes
into a monad. A historical materialist approaches a historical subject only where he
encounters it as a monad. In this structure he recognizes the sign of a messianic
cessation of happening, or, put differently, a revolutionary chance in dIe fight for the
oppressed past. (Illuminations, pp. 264-265)

In fact, Bel�amin's thinking was invariably in dialectical linages. As opposed to the
Marxist dialectic, which "regards every . . . developed social form as in fluid move­
ment;' 24 Benjamin's dialectic tried to halt the flow of the movement, to grasp each
becomlilg as beilig. In Adorno's words, Benjamin's philosophy "appropriates the fetish­
ism of commodities for itself: everything must metamorphoze into a clling in order to
break the catastrophic spell of things."25 His philosophy progressed imagistically, in that it
sought to ((read" historical social phenomena as if they were natural llistorical ones.
Images became dialectical for this philosophy because of the historical index of every
single image,   l�In the dialectical image" of this philosophy, "what has been within a
particular epoch is always simultaneously lwhat has been from time immemorial'" (N4,1).
By s o being, it remained rooted in the mythical. Yet at the same time, the historical
materialist who seized the linage should possess the skill to "fan the spark of hope in the
past;' to wrest historical tradition "anew , , , from a conformism that is about to over­
power it"   (Illuminations, p, 255), Through the irrunobilizlilg of dialectic, the historical
"victors" have theli" accounts with history canceled, and all pathos is shifted toward
salvation of the oppressed.
For Benjamin, freezing the dialectical image was obviously not a method the historian
could employ at any time, For him, as for Marx, historiography was inseparable from
political practice: the rescuing of the past through the writer of history remained bound to
the practical liberation of humanity, Contrasted with the Marxist conception, however,
according to which "capitalist production begets, with the inexorability of a law of nature,
its own negation;'26 Benjamin's philosophy preserves anaTchist and Blanquian elements:

In reality, there is not one moment that does not carry its own revolutionary oppor­
ttmity in itself. , , . The particular revolutionary opportunity of each historical mo­
ment is confIrmed for the revolutionary thinker by the political situation. But it is no
less confirmed for him by the power this moment has to open a very particular,
heretofore closed chanlber of the past. Entry into this chalnber coincides exactly
with political action. (1:1231)

Political action, "no matter how destnlctive," should always "reveal itself as messianic"
(1 :1231), Benjamin's historical materialism can hardly be severed from political meSSial'l­
ism. In a late note, perhaps written under the shock of the Hitler-Stalin pact, Benjamin
formulated as "the experience of our generation: that capitalism will not die a natural
death" (Xlla,3). In that case, the onset of revolution could no longer be awaited with the
patience of Marx; rather, it had to be envisaged as the eschatological end of history: "the
classless society is not the ultimate goal of progress in history but its rupture, so often
attempted and finally brought about (1:1231). Myth is liquidated in the dialectical image
to make room for the " dream of a thing" (1 : 1 174); this dream is the dialectic at a standstill,
the piecing together of what history has broken to bits (see Illuminations) p. 257), the
tikkun of the Lurian Kabbalah,27 Benjamin did quote the young Mal'x, who wanted to
show " that the world has long possessed the drealll of a thing that, made conscious, it
would possess in reality" (N5a,l). But for the interpreter of dialectical llllages, true reality
cannot be lluen-ed from existing reality, He undertook to represent tlIe imperative alId the
final goal of reality as "a preformation of the final goal ofhistoty" (N5,3). The awakening
from myth would follow the messianic model of a history immobilized in redemption as
the historian of the Passagen-Werk had imagined it. In his dialectical images, the bursting
of time coincides with lithe birth of authentic historical time, the time of truth" (N3,1).
Since the dialectical images belong III such a way to messianic time, or since they should
at least let that time reveal itself as a :Bash of lightning, messianism is llltroduced as a kind
of methodology of historical research-an adventtlresome undertaking if ever there was
one. " 'Tbe subject of historical knowledge is the struggling, oppressed class itself" (Illumi­
nations) p. 260); one may imagine the historian of the dialectic at a standstill as the herald
of that class, Bel�amin himself did not hesitate to call him "a prophet turned backward,"
borrowing a phrase from Friem'ich Schlegel (1 :1237): he did not dismiss the Old Testa­
ment idea that prophecy precedes the Messiah, that the Messiah is dependent on proph­
ecy. But Benjamin's historiographer is "endowed with a weak messianic power, a power to
which the past has a claim." Tbe historian honors that claim when he captures that
"image of the past that is not recognized by the present as one of its own concerns" and
thus " threatens to disappear ilTetrievably" (Illuminations) pp. 256-257). Benjamin was
able to recognize only the mythical Ever-Same (I7Ilmergleiclze) III historical evolutions and
was unable to recognize progress, except as a Sprung-a " tiger's leap into the pase' (Illumi­
natioJlJ) p. 263), which was in reality a leap out of history and the entry of the messianic
kingdom, He tried to match this mystical conception of history with a version of dialectics
in which mediation would be totally eclipsed by reversal, in which atonement would have
to yield to criticism and destruction, His " blasting" the dialectical image "out of the
continuum of historical process" (NIOa,3) was akin to that anarchistic impulse which tries
to stop history during revolutions by lllstituting a new calendar, or by shooting at church
clocks, as during theJuly revolution in Paris. The gaze, which exorcized images from
objects blasted loose from time, is the Gorgon gaze at the )(lcies hippocratica of history;'
the "petrified primordial landscape" of myth (Trauet:rpiel, p. 166). But in that mystical
moment when past and present enter "lightning-like" into a constellation-when the true
unage of the past "flashes" in the " now of its recognizabiliti' (N9,7)-that image becomes
a dialectically reversing unage, as it presents itself from the messianic perspective, or (in
materialistic terms) the perspective of the revolution.
From this perspective of '�messianic time," Benjamin defined the present as catastrophe
(1:1243), as the prolongation of that "one single catastrophe" which meets the Angelus
Novus when he looks back on past history. It might appear as if Benjamin vvished to
reintroduce the "large hyphen between past and future,"28 which was thought to be
eradicated after Marx. Yet even Benjamin's late work does not fully forgo historical
reference. Henri :Focillon defined the classical in art as "bonheur rajJl'de/' as the chairou
achme of the Greeks, and Benjamin wanted to use that definition for his own concept of
messianic standstill (see 1 :1229). TIle dialectic at a standstill, the final coming to rest, the
ending of the historical dynamic which Hegel, following Aristotle, wished to ascribe to
the state, was, for Benjamin, prefigured only in 8Tt. A " real definition" of progress,
therefore, could emerge only from the vantage pOUlt of an, as in the Passagen-Werll:
In every true work of art there is a place where, for one who removes there, it blows
cool like the wind of a coming dawn. From this it follows that art, which has often
been considered refractory to every relation with progress, can provide its tnle
definition. Progress has its seat not in the continuity of elapsing time but in its
interferences. (N9a,7)

In dlis sense, it may even be possible to save that problematic definition from the first
expose, accordulg to which in the dialectical unage the mythical, Ur-historical experiences
of the collective unconscious "engender, through interpenetration with what is new, the
utopia"-and that utopia "has left its trace in a thousand conEgurations of life, from
enduring edifices to passing fashions" (section I). Benjamin devised his dialectic at a
standstill in order to make such traces visible, to collect the " trash of history," and to
"redeem" them for its end. He undertook the equally paradoxical and astonishing task of
presenting history in the spirit of an anti-evolutionary understanding of history. As a
"messianic cessation of the event," it would have devolved upon the dialectic at a stand­
still to bring home in the PaJsagen-Werk the very insight Benjamin had long assullilated
when he began that project: "the profane . . . although not itself a category of this [messi­
anic] Kingdom, is at least a category, and one of the most applicable, of its quietest
approach." 29 Benjamin's concept of profane illumination would remain "illuminated" in
this way to the end; his materialist inspiration would be " inspired" in the same way, and
his materialism would prove theological in the same way, despite all "recasting processes."
Bel�am:in)s historical materialism was historically tnle only as the puppet, " which enlists
the services of theology." Nevertheless, it was supposed to " win" (Illuminations, p. 253).
One can be excused for doubting whether this intricate claim could ever be honored. In
that case, the reader, who has patiently followed the topography of the Passagen-Werk,
including all the detours and cul-de-sacs this edition does not veil, may think he is, in the
end, faced with ruins rather than with vlTginal building materials. What Benjamin wrote
about German Trauerspiel however, holds true for tlle Passagen-Werk: namely, that "in the
ruins of gTeat buildings the idea of the plan speaks more impressively than in lesser
buildings, however well preselved they are" ( Trauerspiel, p. 235).

The Story of Old Benjamin
By Lisa Fittko




This account was written in English, in November 1980, by Lisa Fittko, who accompanied Bel�aIllin
across the Pyrenees to the French-Spanish border at the end of September 1940 (and who later
settled in the United States). It is printed in English in Gesammelte Sdlljf!en, vol. 5 (Frankfurt:
Suhrkamp, 1982), pp. 1184-1194, widl supplementary material (letters) relating mainly to the un­
solved mystery of the "large black briefcase" which Benjamin was carrying. Included (p. 1203) is
Bel�amin's last letter, dated Port-Bou, September 25, 1940, and addressed both to Helmy Gurland,
who was with him at the end (see Gcrshom Scholem, f%lter Bel!jamin: The Story qf a Friendship,
trans. Harry 201111 [New York: Schocken, 1981], pp. 224-226), and to Theodor Adorno; it is in
French, in a form reconstructed from memory by Helmy Gurlalld, who had felt it necessary to
destroy the original: "In a situation presenting no way out, I have no olher choice but to make an end
of it. It is in a small village in the Pyrenees, where no one knows me, that my life will come to a close

the situation in which I find myself. llIere is not enough time remaining for me to write all the letters
I would like to write;'


This happened exactly forty years ago. I finally have to keep my promise to write down
the story. People keep saying:Just write it the way it was . . .
I do remember everything that happened; I think I do. TIlat is, I remember the facts.
But can I re-live those days'? Is it possible to step back and into those times when there was
no time for remembering what normal life was like, those days when we adapted to chaos
and stnlggled for survival . . . ?
111e distance of the years-forty of them-has put events for us into perspective, many
believe. It seems to me, though, that this perspective, under the pretense of insight, easily

September 25, 1940
Port-Vendres (Pyrenees Orientales) France}
I remember waking up in that narrow room under the roof where I had gone to sleep a
few hours earlier. Someone was knocking at the door. It had to be the little girl from
downstairs ; I got out of bed and opened the door. But it wasn't the child. I nlbbed my
half-closed eyes. It was one of our friends, Walter Bel�amin-one of the many who had
poured into Marseilles when the Gennans overran France. Old Benjanlln, as I usually
referred to him, I am not sure why-he was about forty-eight. Now, how did he get here?
"GJladige Frau," he said) "please accept my apologies for this inconvenience." The
world was coming apart, I thought, but not Benjamin's jJolitesse. '7ftr Herr Gemahl/) he
continued, "told me how to find you. He said you would take me across the border into
Spain." He said what? Oh well, yes, "rnein Herr Gemahl"-my husband-would say that.
He would assume that I could do it, whatever "ie' might be.
Benjamin was still standing in the open door because there was no room for a second
person between the bed and the wall. Q}lickly I told him to wait for me in the bistro on
the village square.
From the bistro, we went for a walk so that we could talk without being overheard. My
husband had no way of knowing, I explained, but since my arrival here at the border
region last week I had found a safe way to cross the frontier. I had started by going down
to the port and chatting with some of the longshoremen. One of them led me to the union
steward, who in tum directed me to Monsieur Azema, the mayor of the next village,
Banyuls-sur-Mer: the man, I had been told back in Marseilles, who would help me find a
safe road for those of our family and friends who were ready to cross over. An old
socialist, he was among those who had aided the Spanish republic by passing desperately
needed doctors, nurses, and medicine across the border during the Spanish civil war.
"'What a great person, this Mayor Azema, I went on to tell Benjamin. He had spent
hours 'With me working out every detail. Unfortunately, the famous road along the
cemetery walls of Cerberes was closed. It had been quite easy, and a good number of
refugees had used it for a few months, but now it was heavily guarded by the GaI·des
Mobiles. On orders of the German Commission, no doubt. The only truly safe crossing
that was left, according to the mayor, was (?a route Lister. JJ* "That meant that we had to
cross the Pyrenees farther west, at a greater altitude; it meant more climbing.
"That 'Will be all right," Bel�amin said, "as long as it is safe. I do have a heaI·t condi­
tion," he continued, " and I will have to walk slowly. Also, there are two more persons who
joined me on my trip from Marseilles and who also need to cross the border, a Mrs.
Gurland and her teenage son. Would you take them along?"
Sure, sure. "But Mr. Benjamin, do you realize that I am not a competent guide in this
region? I don't really know that road, I have never been up that way myself. I have a piece
of paper on which the mayor penciled a map of the route from his memory, and then he
described to me some details of tums to be taken, a hut on the left, a plateau with seven
pine trees which has to remain to our right or we will end up too faI' north; the vineyard
that leads to the ridge at the right point. You want to take the risk?"
"Yes," he said without hesitation. "The real risk would be not to go."


GlaIlCing at him, I remembered that this was not Benjamin's first attempt to get out of the
trap. Impossible for anyone who knew about his former try to forget it. TIle apocalyptic
atmosphere in Marseilles in 1940 produced its daily absurd story of attempted escape:
plans around fantasy boats and fable captains, visas for countries unknown to Atlas, and
passports from countries that had ceased to exist. One had become accustomed to learn­
ing through the Daily Grapevine which foolproof plan had suffered today the fate of a
House of Cards, We still were able to laugh-we had to laugh-at the comic side of some
of these tragedies. The laughter was irresistible when Dr. Fritz Fraenkel, 'With frail body
and gray mane, and his friend Walter Benjamin, with his sensitive scholar's head and
pensive eyes behind thick glasses, were, tlU'ough bribery, smuggled on a freighter, dressed
up as French sailors. They didn't get very faI�
Luckily, they did get away, though, due to the generalized state of confusion.


We agreed that we would try to see Mayor Azema once more, this time together, so dIat
we could both memorize every detail. I notified my sister-in-Iaw-she, the baby, and I

were going to cross the border and go to Portugal the next week-and I went to Banyuls
with Bel�jamiIl.
Here I have a lapse of memory. Did we dare to take the train in spite of the constant
border checks'( I doubt it. We must have walked the six or eight kilometers from Port-Ven­
dres on the rocky path which by now was familiar to me. I do remember fmding the
mayor in his office, how he locked dle door and then repeated his instructions and
answered our questions,
Two days before, alter he had drawn the sketch of the road for me, he and I had
stepped to the window and he had pointed out the directions, the far-away plateau with
the seven pine trees, and somewhere high up there the crest which we would have to
cross. ��On paper, it looked like an easy walk," I had said, ��but it seems that we have to
cross the high Pyrenees. , . ?" He had laughed: "That's where Spain is, on the other side
of the mountains."
He now suggested that we take a walk this afternoon and do dle first part of the route
to test whether we would find our way. "You go up to this clearing here:' he said pointing
it out on his sketch. "Then you return and check it out with me. You spend the night at the
inn and tomorrow morning around five o'clock, while it is still dark and our people go up
to their vineyards, you st31·t out again and go all the way to the Spanish border." BeI�amin
asked how far it was to the clearing. IILess than an hour . . . well, certainly not more than
two hours. Just a nice walk." We shook hands. '1e VOllS remercie irifiniment, Monsieur Ie
Maire/' I heard Bel�amin say. I can still hear his voice.
We got his companions who had been waiting at the inn and explained our plan. They
seemed to be cooperative, not the complaining kind that I dreaded so much in ticklish
situations. We walked slowly, like tourists enjoying the scenery. I noticed that Bel�amin
was carrying a large black briefcase which he must have picked up when we had stopped
at the inn. It looked heavy and I offered to help him carry it. "This is my new manu­
script," he explained. IIBut why did you take it for this walk?" lIyou must understand that
this briefcase is the most important thing to me;' he said. "l carmot risk losing it. It is the
manuscript that must be saved. It is more important than I am."
Tbis expedition won't be easy, 1 thought. Walter Benjamin and his puzzling ways.
TIlat's just what he is like. VVhen trying to pass for a sailor in the port of Marseilles, had
he toted the briefcase? But 1 better keep my mind on the road, I said to myself, and try to
figure out Azema's directions on the little map.
Here was the empty shed the mayor had mentioned, so we weren't lost . . . not yet.
Then we found the path with a slight turn to the left. And the huge rock he had described.
A clearing! 'D1at must be it. We had made it, after ahnost three hours.
This was about one third of dle total route, according to Azema. I don't remember it as
being difficult. We sat down and rested for a while. BeI�amin stretched out on the grass
and closed his eyes, and I thought it must have been tiring for him.
We were ready to start the descent, but he didn't get up. "Are you all right?" 1 asked.
"1 am fine," he answered, "you three go ahead."
"And you?'
��I am staying here. I am going to spend the night here, and you will join me in the
morning."
This was worse th311 I had expected. VVhat do 1 do now? All I can do is try and reason
widl him. This was wild mountain territory, there could be dangerous animals. As a
matter of fact, I knew that dlere were wild bulls. It was late September and he had nothing
with which to cover himself. There were smugglers around, and who knew what they
might do to him. He would have nothing to eat or drink. Anyhow, this was insane.
He said that his decision to spend the night at the clearing was unshakable since it was
based on simple reasoning. The goal was to cross the border so dmt he and his manuscript
would not fall into the hands of the Gestapo. He had reached one third of this goal. If he
had to return to the village and then do the entire way again tomorrow, his heart would
probably give out. Ergo, he would stay.
I sat down again and said: " Then I too -will stai'
He smiled. " Will you defend me against your wild bulls, gnadige Frau?"
My staying would not be reasonable, he explained quietly. It was essential that I check
back widl Azema and that I get a good night's sleep. Only dlen would I be able to guide
the Gurlands back before sunrise -without possible error or delay, and continue to the
border.
Of course, I knew all that. Above all, I had to get hold of some bread -widl0ut ration
stamps, and perhaps some tomatoes and black-market ersatz marmalade, to keep us going
during ilie day. I dlink I had only tried to shock Benjamin into abandoning his plan, but
of course it hadn't worked.

On the descent, I tried to concentrate on the road so that I would be able to find my way
in the dark the next monting. But my mind kept nagging: he shouldn't be up there alone,
this is all wrong. . . . Had he plamled it this way all along? Or had ilie walk exhausted him
so much that he had decided to stay only after we arrived? But there was this heavy
briefcase that he had taken along. Were his survival instincts intact? If in danger, what
would his peculiar way of reasoning tell him to do?

During the winter, before France's surrender, my husband and Benjamin had been
together in one of the camps where the French govenllIlent imprisoned the refugees from
Nazi Germany-together -with the Nazis. They were at the Camp de Vernuche, close to
Nevers. In one of their conversations Benjamin, a heavy smoker, revealed that he had quit
smoking a few days ago. It was painful, he added. "Wrong tinting," Hans told him. Seeing
Benjamin's inability to handle " the adversities of outer life which sometimes come . . . like
wolves"l-at Vernuche all of life was adversity-Hans had become used to helping him
cope.
He now tried to show Benjamin that in order to tolerate crises and keep one's sanity,
the fundamental rule was to look for gratifications, not punishments. Bel�amin ,mswered,
" I can bear the conditions in the camp only if I am forced to immerse my mind totally in
an effort. '10 quit smoking requires this effort, and it will therefore save me."

TIle next morning everything seemed to be going well. The danger of being seen by the
police or customs guards was greatest when leaving the village and starting up dle foot­
hills. Azema had insisted: start out before sunrise, mingle -with the vineyard workers on
your way up, don't carry anything except a musette, don't talk. That way the patrols can't
distinguish you from the villagers. Mrs. Gurland and her young son, to whom I had
explained these rules, carefully followed them, and I had no trouble finding the way.
The closer we came to the clearing, the more tense I grew. Will BeI�amin be there?
Will he be alive? My imagination started turning like a kaleidoscope.
Finally. Here is the clearing. Here is old Benjamin. Alive. He sits up and gives us a
friendly look. Then I stare at his face-what has happened? Those dark purple blotches
under his eyes-could they be a symptom of a heart attack?
He guessed why I stared. Taking off his glasses and wiping his face with a handker-
chief, he said: "Oh that. The morning dew, you know. The pads inside the ii'ames, see?
111ey stain when they get damp."
My heart stopped beating in my throat and slipped back down to where it belonged.


From here on, the ascent was steeper. Also, we began to be repeatedly in doubt about
which direction to take. To my surprise Benjamin was quite able to understand our little
map, and to help me keep our orientation and stick to the right road.
The word "road" became more and more sy:mbolic. There were stretches of a path, but
more often it became a hardly discernible trail among boulders-and then the steep
vineyard which I will never forget.
But first I have to explain what made this route so safe.
Following the initial descent, the path ran parallel to the widely known "official" road
along the crest of dIe mountain chain, which was quite passable. "Our" road-the Route
LiJter and an old, old smugglers' path-ran below and somewhat tucked inside the
overhang of the crest, out of the sight of the French border guards patrolling above. At a
few points the two roads approached each other closely, and there we had to keep silent.
Benjamin walked slowly and with an even measure. At regular intervals-I believe it
was ten minutes-he stopped and rested for about one minute. Then he went on, at the
same steady pace. He had calculated and worked this out during the night, he told me:
"With this timing I will be able to make it to the end. I rest at regular intervals-I must
rest bifore I become exhausted. Never spend yourself:1
What a strange man. A crystal-clear mind ; unbending inner strength; yet, a wooly­
headed bungler.


The nature of his strength, Walter Benjamin once wrote, is "patience, conquerable by
nothing." 2 Reading tlns years later, I saw him again walking slowly, evenly along the
mountain path, and the contraructions within him lost some of their absurdity.


Mrs. Gurland's son, Jose-he was about fifteen years old-and I took turns carrying the
black bag; it was awfully heavy. But, I recall, we all showed good spirits. There was some
easy, casual conversation, turning mostly around the needs of the moment. But mainly,
we were quiet, watching the road.
Today, when Walter Benjamin is considered one of the century's leading scholars and
critics-today I am sometimes asked: VVhat did he say about the manuscript? Did he
discuss the contents? Did it develop a novel philosophical concept?
Good God, I had my hands full steering my little group uphill; philosophy would have
to wait till the downward side of the mountain was reached. vVhat mattered now was to
save a few people from the Nazis ; and here I was with this-dtis-/wmig/Ler Kauz, ce dri5le
de rype-this curious eccentric. Old Benjamin: under no circumstances would he part with
his ballast, that black bag; we would have to drag the monster across the mountains.


Now back to the steep vineyard. There was no path. We climbed between the vines talks,
heavy with the ahnost ripe, dark and sweet Banyuls grapes . I remember it as an almost
vertical incline; but such memories sometimes distort the geometry. Here, for the first and
only time, Benjamin faltered. More precisely, he tried, failed, and then gave fonnal notice
that this climb was beyond his capability. Jose and I took him between us; with his arms
on our shoulders, we dragged him and the bag up the hill. He breathed heavily, yet he
made no complaint, not even a sigh. He only kept squinting in the direction of the black
bag.
Mter the vineY31-d, we rested on a narrow hillside-the same plateau where we met our
Greek a few weeks later, But that is another story. The sun had climbed high enough to
warm us, so it must have been about four to five hours since we had started out. We
nibbled on the food I had brought in my musette, but nobody ate much. Our stomachs had
shrunk during the last months-first the concentration camps, then the chaotic retreat­
fa pagaille, or The Total Chaos. A nation on the run, moving south; at our backs the
empty villages and ghost tuwns-lifeless, soundless, till the rattling of the German tanks
gulped up the stillness. But, again, that is another story, a very long one,
VVhile we rested, I thought that this road across the mountains had turned out to be
longer and more difficult than we could have guessed from the mayor's description. On
the other hand, if one were familiar with the terrain and didn't carry anything, and were
in good shape, it might really take considerably less time. Like all mountain people,
Monsieur Azema's ideas of distance and time were elastic. How many hours were "a few
hours" to him?
During the following winter months, when we did this border crossing sometimes
twice or even three times a week, I often thought of Benjamin's self-discipline. I thought of
it when Mrs. R. started whining in the middle of the mountains: " . . . don't you have an
apple for me . . . I want an apple . . .," and when Fraulein Mueller had a sudden fit of
screaming ("acro-dementia," we called it) ; and when Dr. H, valued his fur coat more than
his safety (and ours). But these again are different stories,
Right now I was sitting somewhere high up in the Pyrenees, eating a piece of bread
obtained with sham ration tickets, and Benj31Illn was requesting the tomatoes: "WIdl
your kind permission, may I . . . ?" Good old Benjarnin and his Castilian court ceremony.
Suddenly, I realized that what I had been gazing at drowsily was a skeleton, sun
bleached. Perhaps a goat? Above us, in the southern blue sky, two large black birds
circled. Must be vultures-I wonder what they expect from us, . . . How strange, I
thought; the usual me would not be so phlegmatic about skeletons and vultures.
We gathered ourselves up and began trudging on. '"The road now became reasonably
straight, ascending only slightly. Still, it was bumpy and, for Benj31nin, it must have been
strenuous. He had been on his feet since seven o'clock, after all. His pace slowed down
Some more and he paused a little langeI; but always in regular intervals, checking his
watch. He seemed to be quite absorbed by the job of timing himself.

TIlen we reached the peak. I had gone ahead and stopped to look around. The view came
on so sudden, for a moment it stnlck me like a fola morgana, Duwn there below, from
where we had come, the Mediterranean reappeared. On the other side) ahead, steep
cliffs-another sea? But of course, the Spanish coast. Two worlds of blueness. In our back,
to the north, Catalonia's Roussillon country. Deep down La Cole �r1lleille, the autumn
earth in a hundred shades of vermillion. I gasped: never had I seen anything so beautifuL

I knew that we were now in Spain, and that from here on the road would nm straight
until the descent into the town. I knew that now I had to tU1�l back. The others had
the necessary papers and visas, but I could not risk being caught on Spanish soil. But,
no, I could not yet leave this group to themselves, not quite yet. Just another short
stretch . . .

Putting down on paper the details which my memory brings back about this first time I
crossed the border on the Roule Lisle!; a nebulous picture surfaces from wherever it has
been buried all these years. 11nee women�two of them I know vaguely�crossing our
road; through a haze, I see us standing there and talking for a short while. They had come
up a different road, and they then continued their way down to the Spanish side sepa­
rately. The encounter did not particularly surprise or impress me, since so many people
were trying to escape over the mountains.


We passed a puddle. The water was greenish slimy and stank. Benjamin knelt down to
drink .
"You can't drink this water," I said, "it is filthy and surely contaminated." The water­
bottle I had taken along was empty by now, but thus far he hadn't mentioned that he was
thirsty.
"I do apologize," Benjamin said, "but I have no choice. If! do not drink, I might not be
able to continue to the end." He bent his head down towards the puddle.
"Listen to me," I said. "Will you please hold it for a moment and listen to me? We have
almost arrived; just a short while and you have made it. I know you can make it. But to
drink this mud is unthinkable. You will get typhus . .   ,"



"True, I might, But don't you see, the worst that can happen is that I die of typhus . . .
AFTER crossing the border. The Gestapo won't be able to get me, and the manuscript
will be safe. I do apologize."
He drank.
1ue road was now running gently downhill. It must have been about two o'clock in
the afternoon when the rocky wall gave way, and in the valley I saw the village, very
close.
"That is Port-Bou down there! TIle town with the Spanish border control where you
"'Will present yourselves. This street leads straight down. A real road!"
1wo o'clock. We had started out at five in the morning, Benjanrin at seven. A total of
almost nine hours.
" I have to go back now," I continued. "We are in Spain-we have been in Spain for
almost an hour. The descent won't take long; it's so close that you can see every house
from here. You -will go directly to the border post and show your documents : the travel
papers, the Spanish and Portuguese transit 'Visas. VVhen you have your entry stamp, you
take the next train to Lisbon. But you know all that . . . . I must go now, atif Wieder­
SdWll . . ."
For a moment, my eyes followed them as they were walking down the road. It's time
now for me to get out of here, I thought, and started to walk back. I walked on and felt:
TIus isn't alien country any more, I am no stranger here, as I was only this morning. It
also surprised me that I was not tired. Everything felt light, I was weightless and so was
the rest of the world. Benjamin and his companions must have made it by now. How
beautiful it was up here!
Within two hours I was back down in Banyttls. Nine hours uphill, two hours down.
During the following months, by the time we were able to find our way blindfolded, we
once made it up to the border in two hours, and a few times in three to four hours. That
was when our "freight" was young, strong, in good form and, above all, disciplined. I
have never seen these people again, but from time to time a name comes up and suddenly
something clicks. Henry Pachter, historian: Heinz and Ius friend, all-time record two
hours . Or Prof. Albert Hirsdmlan, economist at Princeton: young Hennant. I was criti­
cally ill when he came down to the border. He pressured a French hospital into admitting
me, then crossed over, guided by my husband, in about three hours. I will write that story
down another time.
For all that came later. l11en, back in Banyuls, after my first trip on the Lister route, I
thought: Good old Benjamin and his manuscript are safe, on the other side of the
mountains.


In about a week the word came: Walter Benjamin is dead. He took his life in Port-Bou the
night after his arrival.
The Spanish border authorities had informed the group that they would be retunled to
France. New orders, just received from Madrid: Nobody can enter Spain without the
French exit visa. (Several different versions* exist of the reason Spain gave this time for
closing the border: apatridest may not travel through Spain; or Spanish transit visas issued
in Marseilles were invalid.) Whatever the new di.Tective was, it was lifted soon. Had there
been time for the news to reach the French side of the frontier, crossings would have been
halted while watching developments. We were living in the l�ge of New Directives";
every governmental office in every country of Europe seemed to devote full time to
decreeing, revoking, enacting, and then lifting orders and regulations. You just had to
learn to slip through holes, to tmu, to wind, and to wriggle your way out of this ever­
changing maze, if you wanted to survive.
But Benjamin was not a wriggler . . .
". . . fout se debrouiller": one has to cut through the fog, work one's way out of the
general collapse-that had become the only possible way of life in France. To most, it
meant things like buying forged bread tickets or extra milk for the kids or obtaining some
kind, any kind of permit; in other words, to get something that didn't officially exist. To
some, it also meant to get such things by "collaborating.n For us, the apatndes) it was
primarily a matter of staying out of concentration camps and escaping from the Gestapo.
But Benjamin was no debrouillard . . .
In his remoteness, what counted was that his manuscript and he were out of the reach
of the Gestapo. The crossing had exhausted him and he didn't believe that he could do it
again-he had told me so during our climb. Here, too, he had calculated everything in
advance: he had enough morphine on him to take his life several times over.
Impressed and shaken by his death, the Spanish authorities let his companions con­
tinue their traveL

July 1980
During a recent conversation with Professor Abramsky from London, we talked about
Walter Bel�amin and his work, and I mentioned his last walk.
Tben I got a call from Professor Gershom Scholem, a trustee of Benjamin's literary
estate and his closest friend. He had heard from Abralllsky about our conversation and
wanted to lrnow more, I gave him a summarized description of the events on that day
almost forty years ago.
He asked for every detail concenling the manuscript:
"There is no manuscript;' he said. "Until now, nobody knew that such a manuscript
ever existed."
I am hearing: there is no manuscript. Nobody knows about the heavy black briefcase
carrying the papers that were more important to him than anything else.

Halmah Arendt has "Written about the "little hunchback" * whose threat Benjamin felt
throughout his life and against whom he took all precautions. Benjalnin's "system of pro­
visions against possible danger . . . invariably disregarded the real danger," she says.3
But it seems to me now that the "real danger" was not disregarded by Walter Benjamin
during that night in Port-Bou; it was just that his real danger, his reality, differed from
ours. He must have met again the little hunchback in Port-Bou . . . his very own, the
Benjamin hunchback, alld he had to come to tenns widl him.
Perhaps I will go to Port-Bou and try to pick up some tracks, to retrace what happened
on that side of the mountains forty years ago, with the help of some of our old friends
down there,
Perhaps there will be allother ending to this story.

Expose of 1939
The second expose, "Paris, Capitale du XIXemc siecle" (Gesammelte Sdlrifien, vol. 5,
pp. 60-77), was written by Benjamin in March 1939, in French, at the request of Max
Horkheirne1; who was attempting to enlist a New York banker named Frank Altschul as a
backer for The Arcades Prqject. For this expose, Benjamin added a theoretical Introduction
and Conclusion. In reformulating his Gennan expose in French, he made a number of
significant changes, particularly with regard to Fourier (A, II), Louis Philippe (C, II and
III), and Baudelaire (D, I I and III), wIllIe dropping much factual material. See Ills letter to
Horkheimer of March 13, 1939, in GS, vol. 5, p. 1171. In our translation of the second
expose, we have tried to reproduce the often subtle divergences from the wording of the
first, as well as the numerous verbal parallels (where it is a question of translating a
translation) .

Convolutes
The central portion of the manuscript of The Arcades Projeci (GS, vol. 5, pp. 79-989)
consists of 426 loose sheets of yellowish paper, each folded in half to form a 14 X 22 em.
folio, of which sides 1 and 3 are inscribed in Ber�jarnin's tiny handwriting, widl sides 2 and
4 left blank. These folios are gathered into thirty-six sheafs (the German word Konvolul
means "sheaf" or " bundle") in accordance with a set of themes keyed to the letters of the
alphabet. The titles of the convolutes, as well as the numbering of the individual entries,
derive from Benjamin. In regard to the ordering, the use of lowercase a (as in "Ala,!")
denotes the third page of a folio. The letters without corresponding titles in the Overview
may indicate that Ber�jamin plarmed further convolutes.
In addition to Benjamin's cross-references (signaled with small squares) to rubrics of
different convolutes, or to rubrics without convolutes, many of the citations and reflec­
tions in the manuscript are marked with a system of thirty-two assorted symbols (squares,
triangles, circles, vertical and horizontal crosses-in various inks and colors), which do
not appear in the published text. The symbols are linked to papers that Benjamin en­
trusted to Georges Bataille and that were discovered in the Bataille archive of the Bib­
liotheque Nationale in 1981. These papers contain a detailed plan for the Baudelaire book
on which Benjamin was working in 1937-1938; the encoded items from the convolutes
(more than 60 percent from Convolute J) are grouped there under a set of headings
representing themes of the Baudelaire book as a whole. About half of the material was
then further organized for the composition of the 1938 essay "Das Paris des Second
Empire bei Baudelaire" (Ibe Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire).
TIle convolutes were composed concurrently (rather tllan consecutively) in two stages:
from the fall or winter of 1928 to the end of 1929, and from the begirming of 1934 until
May 1940, The Gennan editor of the Passagen-Werk, Rolf Tiedemann, provides a more
specific dating of the entries on the basis of photocopies of manuscript pages made by
Benjamin inJune 1935 and December 1937 (GS, vol. 5, p. 1262). Witltin a particular
convolute, the entries follow a roughly chronological order (some having been written
earlier, then revised and b'ansferred to the manuscript of the convolutes).
On the typographic differentiation between Benjamin's reflections and Benjamin's
citations in the "Convolutes" section, see the Translators' Foreword.

3. Certain of these muses of Sunealism can be identified more precisely: Luna, the
moon; Kate Greenaway (1846-1901), English painter known for her illustrations of
children's books; Mars, death; Cleo de Merode (1875-1966), French dancer who
epitomized the demimonde; Dulcinea, the beloved of Don Qyixote and the image of
idealized woman; Libido, an allusion to Freud; Baby Cadum, publicity and advertis-
ing; Friederike Kempner (1836-1904), German poet and socialite. A comparison
with the two other "catalogues of muses" (see F°,4 and FO,IO in "First Sketches")
reveals that Dulcinea is a variant of Ibsen's Hedda Gabler, and that Benjamin thought
of adding the pamter Angelika Kauffrmum (1741-1807), a friend of Goethe's. An·
other list, presumably the earliest, is found in "The Arcades of Paris" (hO,I). [J.L.]
Countess Geschwitz, a lesbian artist, is a character in Frank Wedekind's Erdgeist and
Die Buchse der Pandora, plays which inspired Alban Berg's unfinished opera Lulu. The
identity of Tipse remains a mystery. When Benjamin writes that the mother of Sune­
alism was eine Passage, he plays on the feminine gender of the noun in German.

Benjamin might be alluding here to the hospitals of Paris, such as the Hotel-Dieu
(near Notre Dame), a laTge classical-style building with an inner courtyard, ornamen­
tal gardens, frescoes, and long arcaded galleries around the courtyard and in the
interior. "Corridors:' in this entry, translates Wandelhallen. "Turn into their recovery"

Q [Panorama1
1. Panoramas were introduced in France in 1799 by the American engineer Robert
Fulton. But it was a certainJaIues Thayer who, after acquiring the patent, developed
the two rotundas on the Boulevard Montmartre which were separated by the arcade
known as the Passage des Panoramas. These large circular tableaux, painted in
trompe-l'oeil and designed to be viewed from the center of the rotunda, displayed
scenes of battles and cities: "View of Paris," "Evacuation of Toulon by the English,"
<IEncampment at Boulogne," I�Rome," "Athens;) 'jelusulem." As the number of
panoramas increased and their popularity grew, new forms made their appearance:
the cosmorama at the Palais-Royal, later transfelTed to Rue Vivienne ; the neorama of
M. Allaux, with its interior scenes ; the georama, with its general and detailed views of
different parts of the world. But the decisive invention remains the diorama of Da�
guerre and Bouton, which was opened in 1822 on the Rue Sanson, near the Boule­
vard Saint-Martin, and then installed on the Boulevard de Bonne-Nouvelle. The
pictures were painted on cloth transparencies, which by 1831 were being used with
various lighting effects. TIle installation bUTIled down in 1839, together with the
laboratory where Daguerre and Niepce conducted their first experiments in photog­
raphy. [J.L.]

v [Conspiracies, Compagnonnage1

Compagnonnage refers to trade guilds, solidarity associations among workers. The word
comes from compagnon: "companion;' "workman;' '1ourneyman." A central feature of
cornpagnonnage, up through the middle of the nineteenth century, was the tour de P,"ance, in
which journeymen artisans traveled to various towns of France seeking employment in
order to complete their professional training. The tour generally lasted three to four years
and culminated in the production of a masterwork.

5. Societe des Saisons: name of a secret society established by Blanqui, in 1837, -with the
aid of two other young republicans. It utilized classical conspiratorial techniques to
form a tightly disciplined and hierarchical organization. Three years earlier, Blanqui
had founded its predecessor, the secret revolutionary Societe des Familles, and in
1832 he had been a member of the republican Societe des Anns du Peuple, which
espoused a Saint-Simonian doctrine,
6, In the aftermath of theJuly Revolution, the ministers of Charles X were arrested and,
in December, put on trial. Throughout the trial, troops of the Gal'de Nationale, led by
the marquis de Lafayette, were required to control the crowds who gathered in the
streets to demand the death sentence for the ministers, The latter were sentenced to
life imprisonment on December 24, 1830, but they were all granted anmesty in 1836.

members of the organization in 183 6-was answered: "One must make a social revo­
lution," See Alan B. Spitzer, The Revolutionary Theon'es o/Louis Auguste Blanqui (1957;
rpt. New York: AMS Press, 1970), pp. 90, 92. Marx, too, calls for a social revolution.
11,   Compagnon actually derives from the Old French word compaignon, which in tum
comes from the Vulgar Latin companio (com, "with" +- panis, " bread"), The word,
meaning originally "one who eats bread with another;' is unrelated to compas, " com­
pass,"
12. Related to the English word "vent," an obsolete term for liS ale;' "hostelry;' The
rrench word vente may have originally referred to a stand of timber.

leather in his shop and, in a caption, lauding Sue as "an eminent surgeon wielding the
scalpel" that will remove France's social ills-"scalpel" deriving from the Salne Latin
root as ec!wppe. The work is thus a poem in praise of Sue's scalpel from the idlOppe of

Materials for the Expose of 1935
1 . In Etienne Cabet's novel   Voyage en lear-ie (1839), the narrator learns that i n learia
" fasmon never changes; that there are only a certain number of different shapes for
hats-toques, turbans, and bonnets ; and that the model for each of these shapes had
been . , . decided upon by a committee."      Oeuvres d'Etienne Cabel, 3rd ed. (paris :
Bureau du Populaire, 1845), p. 13Z See B4,2.
2. See B2,5. See also section 3 of the " Expose of 1935, Early Version."
3 . Presumably a reference to Fourier.
4. See Franz Kafka, "The Cares of a Family Man," in Kafka, The Complete Stones (New
York: Schocken, 1971), pp. 427-429 (trans. Willa Muir and Edwin Muir). Odradek is
a diminutive creature, resembling a flat star-shaped spool for thread, who can stand
upright and roll around, but can never be laid hold of, and has no fixed abode. You
might think he was a broken-down remnant, but in his own way he is perfectly
finished. He can talk, but often remains mute.
5 . Could also be construed as lithe knocking that startles us out of sleep."
6. "Fateful date)): possibly an allusion to the dramatic Socialist gains, that year, in the
Chamher of Deputies.
7. "Traumkitsch" (first published in 1927) is in GS, vol. 2, pp. 620-622; in English in
S� vol. 2, pp. 3-5. Benjamin is concerned here with "distilling" the l'sentimentality
of our parents.))
8. The second stage of work on The Arcades Pr�ject began in early 1934, when Benjamin
was commissioned to write an article in French on Haussmann for Ie Monde, a
periodical edited at that time by Alfred Kurella. The article was never written, but
Benjamin's preliminary studies remain, in the form of the drafts and outline printed
here as No. 19. TIle first draft is in French; the second and third drafts are in German.
The outline begins in French and switches to Gennan after the second "embellisse­
ment strategique."
9. The schemes printed as Nos. 20 and 21 were preparatory to the drafting of the
expose of 1935. The first is dated by Benjamin himself; the second most likely dates
from the beginning of May 1935. The reflections contained in No. 22 appear to
belong to a more extended scheme, which has not been preserved.
10. Nos. 23, 24, and 25 apparendy date from after the drafting of the expose ofl935. No.
25 was written by Benjamin on the back of a letter of December 22, 1938, addressed
to 1:llin ; while clearly connected to central concerns of the Arcades complex, it could
relate as well to the project of a book on Baudelaire or to the theses "Ober den Begriff
der Geschichte" (On the Concept of History) .

6. According to Adorno, Benjam:in's intention was " to eliminate all overt commentary
and to have the meanings emerge solely through a shock-like montage of the mate­
rial. . . . His magnum opus, the crowning of his antisubjectivism, was to consist solely
of citations" (Adorno, Pnsms) 239). "nlOugh this thought may seem typical of Ben­
jamin, I an]. convinced that Ber�arnin did not intend to work in that fashion. There is
no remark in the letters attesting to this. Adorno supports his position with two
entries from the Passagen-Werk itself (see Nl,10 and Nla,8), which can hardly be
interpreted in that way. One of these already turned up in the "First Sketchesll of 1928
or 1929 (see 0°,36), at a time when Bel�amin stated that he was still considering an
essay, which he had begun in the ��Early Draftsll-by no means, however, in the form
of a montage of quotations.

1935: merely in quotation marks, so to speak. No single text is meant by "sketch"; the
"second sketch,ll especially, does not denote the 1935 expose. Benjamin had in mind
the concept of the work, such as it can be inferred from an interpretation of the
totality of the notes from both stages of his project.

15. In the 4'First Sketches;' in which economic categories are used either metaphysically
or in a desultory fashion, we fll1d uncommented references to two passages in the first
and third volumes of Capital, and these references are to the "original edition" (see
5:1036; Q',4), ' Ibis could be especially instructive in the case of the first volume,
whose first edition of 1867-the original edition refelTed to-is very rare and is
almost never cited. We may sUmllse that Horkheimer or Adorno referred Benjamin
to the pages in question during the "historical conversations" in the fall of 1929. The
library of the Institut mr Sozialforschung owned, at that time, a copy of the original
edition, and at least Horkheimer was wont to quote from scarce editions. This conjec­
ture is corroborated when one checks the relevant passage in the first edition of
Capital: it deals with the definitive fommlations of commodity fetishism-that is, the
very concept whose "unfolding" would be " the central core" of the second Passagen­
Werk sketch. Since the manuscript of the "First Sketches" was abandoned shortly
after this entry, it is very possible that Benjamin's abandoning the manuscript may
have been caused by the obstacles created by the suggestion that it was necessary for
him to read Capital. Finally, a letter from Adorno to Horkheimer ofJtme 8, 1935,
which is absent from the fifth volume because it was made available only after the
edition's publication, may well tum speculation into certainty. Adorno characterizes
the first expose as "an attempt to unlock the nineteenth century as 'style' by means of
the category of 'commodity as dialectical unage!" He adds: "This concept owes as
much to you as it is close to me (and as I have been beholden to it for many years). In
that memorable conversation in the Hotel Carlton [in Frankfurt) which you, Ben­
jamin, and I had about dialectical images, together with Asja Lacis and Gretel, it was
you who claimed that feature of a historical image as central for the commodity; since
that conversation, both Benjamin's and my thoughts on this matter have been reor­
ganized in a decisive way. The Kierkegaard book [by Adorno] contains their rudi­
ments, the 'Arcades' sketch embraces them quite explicitly."

23, Benjamin never brought himself to define these categories at length, yet they are the
basis of all his dlOUghts on the Passagen-WerkJ which he identified with dIe "world of
dialectical images" and for which dialectic at a standstill was to be " the quultessence
of the method" (P',4) , He apparently developed the theory of dialectical images
mainly in conversations with Adorno. Although both concepts are absent from Ben­
jamin's publications during his lifetime, the "dialectical image" appears-with refer­
ence to its Benjaminian origins-in Adorno's Habilitatio'l1Jschrjft on Kierkegaard,
which was published in 1933 (Adorno) Kierkegaard: Construction iftile Aesthetic) trarlS.
Robert Hullot-Kentor [Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1988]), I sball
here only allude to the fact that AdoTI10's ulterpretation of the concept differs from
Benjamids in more than mere nuances. In his Kierkegaard book, Adorno equated
the dialectical image with allegory, and later he also seems to liken it to phantasmago­
ria (see N5,2, and 5 : 1 136). Benjamin characterized Adorno's definition of the "antin­
omy of appearance and meaning" as "fundamental" for both allegory and
phantasmagoria, but he found it "confusing" in its application to the "dialectical
image" (1:1174) . The difference might be found in the cOlmection Bel�amin made
between the dialectical image and elements of messianism-a cOlmection to which
Adorno, the more scrupulous Marxist, could not accede. One may try to put it this
way: the phantasmagorias of the arcade or the collector as such are not dialectical
images in Benjamin's sense; both the arcades and the collector become dialectical
linages only when the historical materialist decip/u�rs them as phantasmagorias. But in
Benjamin's opinion, the key that allows the historical materialist to unlock the code
remains connected to the discovery of a messianic force in history (see 1 : 1232).
