### I {.h3}

The first regular money I earned -- I was a painter at the time -- was working for the Worker's Education Association in London. Three evenings a week I would take the tube to Edgware and talk with London Transport bus drivers and conductors about art. I was younger than any of them and had (for the epoch) outrageously long hair.

Some of the bus people painted as a hobby and would show me their work; others, for different reasons, were curious about how paintings are made and why. I think they put up with me because I seemed to them improbable. At the same time, they didn't disbelieve me. And so they accepted me as a kind of expert of the unexpected.

'You gave us a surprise last week,' they'd say. 'What have you got up your sleeve tonight?' I brought books with me and, drinking cups of tea and eating the cakes which one of the conductresses had baked, we turned the pages ...

[]{#preface.html_page_2}I received more from them than they did from me. I began to learn something about the space in their lives -- and for each one it was slightly different -- which they hoped their experience of art might fill. I began to see dimly how life can welcome art.

Years passed, and I became a writer. Some of the books I wrote were about painting and artists. My work owed a lot to certain philosophers and art historians -- to Wölfflin, Antal, Max Raphael, Klingender, Ortega y Gasset, Hauser, Berenson, Friedländer, Walter Benjamin, and others. Yet I'm no art historian. I am too impatient, and I live too much in the present.

When I want to get closer to works from the past, I do drawings from them. (As I have done drawings from Titian's paintings.) This is, however, a gestural approach, not an historical one. In drawing, you try to touch, if only for an instant -- like playing tag -- the master's vision.

What still intrigues me most is the question I first faced during those evenings in Edgware. How does a work of art, once created, re-enter life? Promising what?

About this there are still stories to be told and, as with any story, they have to be followed rather than invented.

Katya, my daughter, grew up surrounded by a lot of art books. Later she travelled and would visit museums and send me postcards. We didn't talk much about painting -- far more about places, films, animals, language. When she sent me []{#preface.html_page_3}the first card from Venice, I replied hoping that she would reply. She did, and this story began.

*John Berger*

PS Katya's letters were written in French, which is her first language; mine were in English. Much later, Katya translated my letters into French, and I did the same with hers into English. We have used my English translations for this book.

### II {.h3}

As long as I can remember, I have been used to looking at paintings. Without any fuss, a monograph on Caravaggio or the catalogue of a Poussin exhibition was dumped on my knees, and I was left alone to turn the pages. By a flaring paraffin lamp -- this was in a decrepit, out-of-the-way farmhouse in Provence where I spent the most luminous moments of my childhood -- I started, as I looked at these books, to dream -- a bit like one of those figures in a Chagall painting crossing the sky above the roofs of churches.

Stories were prompted by the contours of an angel playing a musical instrument. Others came panting from the clenched bodies of *The Rape of the Sabines*. Soon yet others were being whispered from between fruits in a still-life, from the borders of a colour, from the scratches of a texture.

[]{#preface.html_page_4}Several years later -- this was when I was earning my first wages working evenings at a McDonald's -- I realised how there's no communication more total than that between an object (preferably a work of art) and the one watching it. That painting over there, that story, that melody, but also that hairstyle or that expression -- each took me by the hand and led me into its forest. Many things stayed hidden, others spoke to all my senses. It was as if my own gaze took on flesh from contact with the thing seen and then blew on it with warm breath which was almost visible, as when one breathes into frozen air.

At about the same time, I came to understand that I was never more alive than when I was able to give myself, even if only partially, to such an exchange. The capacity to join myself to what I was looking at -- and particularly if it was something which had been created -- offered me nothing less than immortality -- for I left in this thing, destined to outlive me, some scrap of what I had lived.

A river painted by Courbet, containing something of my own experience of water flowing, of wetness, of the visible, was more intensely and permanently alive than I could ever be. And, what is more, it conferred upon me a little of its own immortality. It went beyond me and tugged me into the universal. A prelude by Bach, taking the same path as one of my dreams, but surpassing it in solidity and precision, would then miraculously lend my dream, retrospectively, its own grace.

At this age, too, I came upon my dearest wish: The best thing that might happen, I decided, would be to become []{#preface.html_page_5}entirely a painting, a novel, a quartet. Not as a protagonist, whose own life was built into art, but in a more diffused way, to become the under-canvas for a portrait of a gentleman, to become the recurring rhyme of a poem, or to become a description of people dancing at a ball. Thus I would breathe onto such creations and be materialised in them for ever.

At first, I invented a god who lived in the sky, surrounded by a committee of those who were timeless and who looked through a telescope to direct the story of my life! Later, my narcissism pared away by the years, I found enough comfort in the idea that with or without a telescope focused on me, a simple movement of a human face (mine or somebody else's) could be the equivalent of a work of art, and that it was the quality of seeing -- and, equally, the power of the invitation to look -- which offered that feeling of cosmic harmony which I had discovered when a painting welcomed me into its forest.

I started to hunt everywhere for promises of this magic, a magic which is both permanent and ephemeral, inimitable and universal. And so it was that I was led, with the passage of time, to become a film critic, still searching for this sudden solidity and swift incarnation which we call *meaning*.

*The Rape of the Sabines*, which I had goggled at long ago by the flaring paraffin lamp and which, for a fraction of a second, surrounded the whole world with its frame, had little by little shown me how art with its miraculous eye -- an eye which both fixes and liberates -- can seize the essential.

[]{#preface.html_page_6}When in 1990 I went to the Titian exhibition in Venice, I saw the old painter coming towards me, and I saw myself spread out in paint on a scrap of canvas. This is what made me want to start a dialogue with John: he who had hinted to me how life welcomes art, he who knew, as well as I do, that everything still escapes us.

*Katya Berger Andreadakis*

[]{#preface.html_page_7}'That's purity,' he said,

'It is the same on the slopes as in your entrails.'

And he spread his hands as would

an old experienced God creating clay

and heavenliness together.

PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE

*John*,

What do I think about Titian? In one word on a postcard: flesh.

*Love, Katya*

AMSTERDAM

*Kut*,

All right, flesh. First, I see his own, when he's old. Why do I immediately think of Titian as an old man? Out of solidarity -- given my own age? No, I don't think so. It's to do with our century and the bitterness of its experience. It's always searching for rage and wisdom rather than harmony. Late Rembrandts, late Goyas, Beethoven's last sonatas and []{#letters.html_page_10}quartets, late Titians ... Imagine the élan of a century whose old master was the young Raphael!

I think of the self-portraits painted when he was in his sixties or seventies. Or himself as the penitent Saint Jerome, painted when he was in his eighties. (Perhaps it's not a self-portrait; it's only my guess, but I feel he was thinking intensely about himself when he was painting it.)

What do I find? A man who is physically imposing and has considerable authority. You can't take liberties with him. With the late, decrepit Rembrandt it would have been easy. This one knows how power works, and he has exercised his own. He has turned the trade of being a painter into a profession -- like that of a General or an Ambassador or a Banker. He's the first to do this. And he has the confidence that goes with it.

And also a painterly confidence. In his late works, he is the first European painter to display -- rather than hide or disguise -- his manual gestures when putting the pigment onto the canvas. Thus he makes painting physically confident in a new way -- the act of the painting hand and arm becomes expressive in itself. Other artists like Rembrandt or van Gogh or Willem de Kooning will follow his example. At the same time, his originality and boldness were never foolhardy. His attitude to everything in Venice was realistic.

And yet, yet... the more I look at the way he painted himself, the more I see a frightened man. I don't mean a coward. He doesn't take risks, but he has courage. He does not normally []{#letters.html_page_11}show his fear. But his brush can't help but touch it. It's most evident in his hands. The're nervous like the hands of a money-lender. Yet his fears could not, I think, have been concerned with money.

A fear of death? The Plague was rampant in Venice. A fear leading to penitence? A fear of judgement? It may have been any of these, but they are too general to help us understand him or to get closer to him. He lives to be a very old man. The fear lasts a long time. And long-drawn-out fear becomes doubt.

What provoked this doubt in him? I suspect it was intimately connected with Venice, with the city's special kind of wealth and commerce and power. All of which, as you say, had to do with the flesh.

*Love, John*

GIUDECCA, VENICE

*John*,

Several times whilst I was wandering through the exhibition, I crossed paths with, was followed by, lost sight of, and then again found myself beside, an old man. He was alone and muttering to himself.

The first time I saw him, he was coming back from one of the last rooms and very decidedly making for the []{#letters.html_page_12}painting *Christ Carrying the Cross*. And there at my side he stopped.

'One uses painting', he suddenly said, 'to clothe oneself, to keep warm ...'

At first, I felt put out and scowled at him, but he went on, as if nothing had happened.

'Jesus carries his cross and, me, I carry the art of painting, I wear it like something woollen.'

He had won me over.

Now he was making for the *Rest on the Flight into Egypt*. In some way, I must have annoyed him, for he appeared to be angry, spitting out disconnected words.

'The fur, ough! The fur of my painting... stuff, stuff ...'

By *The Portrait of a Man*, he spoke directly to the sitter, poking his nose towards the painted nose.

'First I painted you all dressed up, then I did a whole painting of an animal's skin!'

He didn't need to turn round to know that I was following him, and as we passed a group of visitors who were listening to their guide, he said to me out of the corner of his mouth, as if it were a joke, 'Dogs, rabbits, sheep, they all have their fur to keep them warm and, me, I want to imitate them with my brushes!'

[]{#letters.html_page_13}When he next spoke, not without a little pride, I wasn't sure whether he was referring to the portrait of a Cardinal or to the *Portrait of a Man*.

'Nobody else has painted men's beards like that!' he said. 'They're soft as monkey's hair.'

I lost sight of him. A little later, the gallery's alarm siren started up. Given that my friend (we had by now smiled at each other) obviously knew little about the rules and routines of modern art exhibitions, I immediately thought of him. No sooner had I done so, than I saw a uniformed official remonstrating with the old man and indicating the statutory distance which must be respected before each canvas. The old man was saying 'You must surely see, velvet, you must see, velvet is my favourite material, and I can't resist its touch!'

From that moment on, he decided to stay with me. He followed wherever I went. He continued his monologue, however, and didn't attempt conversation.

Whilst I was looking at *Danaë*, he abruptly dragged me towards the Berlin *Self-Portrait*.

'It's a pity they didn't hang them in the same room,' he said. 'The hair on the body, the hair of the head, feathers, nobody can get more naked than that... I wash and wash my colours until they look like the coat of an animal. By working on clothes you can make them look worn, silky, clinging, almost like flesh.'

[]{#letters.html_page_14}After this, for him, long speech, he seemed a little discouraged. For half an hour he didn't say a word. In front of *Venus and Adonis*, he simply verified that I was studying the picture correctly. For my part, I showed my admiration by opening my eyes and mouth wide.

He seemed almost to have finished.

Before the *Flaying of Marsyas*, there was another splutter of words: 'When you skin an animal, you touch the truth about flesh.'

In front of the *Pietà*, he sat down. I think he sat there for a very long time. At first, I didn't know whether to wait, to greet him, or, to tell him my own impressions. He made a sign for me to come closer. Certainly, he knew that his remarks about fur had impressed me, for instead of talking about the famous mysterious hand imploring the saint's statue in the *Pietà* -- the hand I was staring at fixedly -- he went his own way and repeated 'Hair is to the body what painting is to the world!'

Then, with a deep laugh, he added something which made me think of you: 'You can burrow into it, you can look underneath it, you can lift it, or you can pull it -- but don't try to shave it -- it'll always grow again!'

Before turning away from him for good, I had a very clear image of my own body lying naked on a canvas in the exhibition: of moss underneath me, of a dog at my side, of my outlines scarcely separable from the surrounding landscape. A []{#letters.html_page_15}landscape which, later, Courbet might have walked over. With the grass, the clouds, and the soil, my flesh would then have been the earth's coat.

*Hugs, Katya*

HAUTE SAVOIE

*Kut*,

All that you say about fur makes me think of his dogs. Was the old man by any chance accompanied by a dog?

I think he loved dogs. Perhaps they calmed or encouraged him. Were they witnesses? Witnesses he could trust. Dumb, dumb witnesses. Perhaps it sometimes happened that, whilst painting with his right hand, his left ferociously stroked one of his dogs. The fur as company for his fingers, and the dog shifting its weight as his arm moved!

At that time, it was something of a fashion to put dogs into paintings. One finds them in Rubens, Velasquez, Veronese, Cranach, van Dyck ... amongst other things, they were a kind of go-between between men and women. Ambassadors of desire. They represented (according to their breed and size) both femininity and virility. They were almost human -- or they shared the privacy of humans -- and yet they were guileless. They were also randy. Randy, and nobody could raise their eyebrows -- because, after all, they were dogs!

[]{#letters.html_page_16}We see them in many of his paintings. In portraits of men and women and in mythological subjects. But nowhere more strangely than in the late picture *A Boy with Dogs*. There's no other painting like it, and I tend to agree with the experts who mostly dismiss the idea that this is a detail taken from a larger canvas. What we see is more or less what the old man meant us to see. A boy -- how old do you think he is? Three? Four at the most? -- alone in a dark landscape with two dogs and two young pups (perhaps four weeks old?). The boy puts his arm round the white dog -- who, I guess, is male -- for reassurance. The mother, the bitch, is the only one looking at us, and the pups have nosed their way through the fur to her teats.

Despite the dusk, the scene is calm, peaceful, *comblé* as the French would say. Nobody wants anything more.

The dogs are the boy's family. I would even say parents. The boy's legs and the two visible legs of the white dog are like four legs of the same table -- practically interchangeable. Everyone is waiting -- which is to say living.

Isn't waiting the essential occupation of dogs? Learnt maybe because of their proximity to humans. Waiting for the next event or the next arrival. Here the last important event, it seems, was birth. Pups and boy born into this bitch of a life. Born to wait for death. Yet meanwhile there's warmth, milk, the mysteries of the fur, and eyes which are speechless.

The old man, of course, wanted your sympathy. No, not sympathy, your interest. Because if you were interested, you []{#letters.html_page_17}would pose for him, and he wanted to paint you! Painting women, he forgot his doubt. But each time he forgot, he was adding to his worry. All the women he painted -- from Adriane to the Repentant Magdalene -- represented this worry, which wasn't about women. Each one consoled and at the same time reinforced his worry.

The painting with the dogs is about the consolation. It's a honeyed painting. It's about bliss. The pups have discovered bliss in the fur -- as Jove will never find it with Danaë or Danaë with Jove.

Meanwhile the other three (the boy and the two adult dogs) are waiting ... And the two waiting dogs, watching, are the old man's accomplices. They are the nearest he can find to what he has dreamt of painting and to what he paints with. They can bite and they are innocent.

*I love you, John*

ATHENS

*John*,

I try to find an answer to the question 'What made him paint?' And I can hear only one word, coming from all the chaos of physical matter, as if from the bottom of a black well.

Desire. His desire (as befits an eminently virile painter) was, if not to cut into appearances, at least to penetrate and lose himself []{#letters.html_page_18}in the skin of things. Yet, being human and being a painter, he came up against the impossibility of doing this: the heart of nature, the animal in humans, the world's pelt can never be seized, and, above all, they are unrepeatable, unreproducible. And so, for a while, like many of his contemporaries, he used his skill to show that everything was vanity, *vanitas vanitatis*: beauty, wealth, art.

The women in his pictures -- or rather *the* Titian woman, with her special simplicity and innocence -- is to him a relentless reminder of his artistic impotence and defeat. Him the master! Perhaps it was women who embodied the doubt you talk about? Naked, the colours of their flesh are for drowning in. Never have the painted bodies of women demanded as much as his do, to be touched, to be pressed with the hands -- as Mary Magdalene presses her hand through her hair against her own breast. Yet like all other bodies in paintings across the whole world, those painted by Titian can be neither touched nor plunged into.

Gradually, he came to understand that in the very impotence of his art (this art which continually underlined the virility of the men it depicted), there might be a hidden miracle. With the sables and bristles of his brushes -- instead of rendering the texture of the world's hide -- he could twist its limbs! Unable to reproduce, he could transform and transfigure. Instead of being the servant of appearances, obliged to lick their boots, he could impose his will upon them. Produce arms or hands which could never exist. Bend limbs against their nature. Fuzz objects to the point of their becoming unrecognisable. Make contours tremble so that they came to []{#letters.html_page_19}depict matter without any outline. Deny the difference between bodies and corpses. (I'm thinking of the last *Pietà*.)

I pack all kinds of questions concerning power, prestige, even the question of the dog, into this train of thought. The truth is that Titian's art is itself untouchable, inviolable. It calls out and then it forbids. We remain open-mouthed.

*Kisses, Katya*

PARIS

*Kut*,

*Vanitas vanitatis*. In 1575, the Plague ravaged Venice, killing almost a third of the city's inhabitants. The old man, aged nearly a hundred, died from the Plague in 1576. As did his son. After their deaths, their house on the Biri Grande, full of pictures and precious objects, was looted. And the following year, a fire in the Ducal Palace destroyed paintings by Bellini, Veronese, Tintoretto, and the old man.

I see you today, not in the Piazza San Marco, but on the terrace of your flat in Athens. In Gyzi, where all the kitchens and bedrooms overlook one another, and the washing hangs between telephone cables and hibiscus flowers. Perhaps Athens is the antipodes of Venice? Dry, makeshift, ungovernable. A city of merchants, national heroes, and the widows of heroes, where nobody dresses up.

[]{#letters.html_page_20}And I'm writing in a Paris suburb, and I've been to the Sunday market. I saw young couples there, pale, poorly dressed against the rain, wearing jeans, hair lacquered, with city acne, holding hands, pushing prams, teasing in argot, each one with a thin, crooked-toothed recipe for happiness. And as I watched them I asked myself: What would they say about the *Flaying of Marsyas*? Who knows? Everyone lives legends.

In the *Flaying of Marsyas*, a lapdog is licking drops of blood off the ground below where Marsyas is strung up. On the right, there's another dog, held by a boy, who is very like the one in the painting with the pups.

OK. Marsyas, the satyr-artist, entered a musical contest with the god Apollo and lost. Under the agreed conditions, the winner could do what he liked with the loser, and Apollo chose to flay the satyr alive! There are some convincing allegorical interpretations. But what interests me is why the old man chose this subject. It's very close to what he told you in the gallery. Satyrs were, by definition, creatures who revealed how skin was like fur, and both were the outer coverings of a mystery. A kind of clothing which one couldn't unbutton or unzip except with a killing knife.

The two men in the Marsyas canvas, with their blades and their precision (I have seen peasants skin goats with exactly the same gestures), are the precursors of Fontana and Saura, who, in our century, slashed the canvases they painted in pursuit of what lay beyond the skin of the canvas, deep in the wound.

[]{#letters.html_page_21}But even after one has acepted the subject und interpreted it, one finds oneself face to face with something more startling! The scene (which in life would be an abominable scene of torture) is bathed in a light of honey and an atmosphere of elegiac fulfilment.

You find exactly the same atmosphere in the *Nymph and Shepherd*, painted at the same time. Yet the *Nymph and Shepherd* is a love scene, and in it the shepherd is playing the pipes which cost Marsyas his life!

Find the old man in Athens and ask him what he meant.

It must be the season of pomegranates.

*Take care, John*

ATHENS

*John*,

You're right, it's the season for pomegranates. I'm looking at one now. Split open by the centrifugal energy of its own ripeness. He would have been able to paint its vivid blood and its granular flesh -- except that it's too exotic, too eastern for him. Rather, I see for him the stone of a peach. Enlarged enormously and flattened. In fact, I see such a stone as the ground of his painting, as a kind of lining to the canvas!

[]{#letters.html_page_22}Yesterday I was looking for the old man to ask him your question about why the light is so honeyed in the painting of Marsyas' torture. Instead I found a gathering of other old men in Akadimias Street, right in the centre of Athens.

Thousands of vehicles pass there every hour of the day and night. It's also the turn-around point of the city's principal bus lines. It's always crowded. It's where I pick up my bus to go to work every day. Bus no. 222. And there, two days ago, some people, waiting to get on their bus, met their deaths.

The bus -- which should have taken them home for their lunch break -- went out of control and ploughed into the crowd, laying low eight people before ramming into a barrier and stopping. The victims, who were mostly students, were suffocated, the bus on top of them. Screams, blood, chaos. The police and ambulance couldn't get through, for there were too many people. One hour later, the radio announced the victims' names. Everybody cried and crossed themselves. A tragedy. Yet it's the aftermath I want to tell you about, for it takes us to the heart of Greece.

When I got off my bus there yesterday (it was a bus no. 222 which caused the deaths), I saw a gathering of three or four hundred people, all men, mostly old-age pensioners -- those same men go every morning to the smoky *kafenios*, the cafés for male clients only, to play backgammon, sip their ouzos, and comment on what's happening in the world -- rather than trying to change it. In Akadimias Street, they were waving their arms about and shouting with great excitement.

[]{#letters.html_page_23}At first, I thought it must be a new meeting place for a political debate preceding the elections. But no. What these old men had come to do was to reconstitute the event. Each one had decided when he had awakened yesterday morning to make his way to the scene of the drama and try to see more clearly what had happened.

'The girl student was there. She wanted to run when she saw the bus coming towards her, but the crowd was too dense -- and there was also the bus shelter, which stopped her going in the other direction.'

'No, you've understood nothing! It was the ill-fated old pensioner who must have been standing here, because they said his legs were the first to be broken! Old bones break easily'

'I tell you, those who died were all further down there. The ones here escaped. Those over there against the barrier, they got it. The others were only wounded, and now they're in Evangelismos Hospital. They'll survive -- thank God. Think though of the families of those who, for no reason, died yesterday at 12.15, think of them!'

And so on. A chorus straight out of Aeschylus. Or perhaps, more exactly, the agora, the future Roman forum. The market-place where everybody met to discuss the affairs of the *polis*.

When tourists enthuse about the living heritage of ancient Greece, it makes me a little sick. It's too easy, too obvious. And it reminds one painfully of the political nullity into []{#letters.html_page_24}which Greek civilisation has fallen. But one thing has survived unquestionably, and that's the national proclivity for *comment*. To relive happenings, to make a synthesis of them, and to draw conclusions and lessons (which are usually forgotten the next day). Greek philosophy, in its ancient sense and in its contemporary, popular sense, comes exactly from this vision of the Chorus: to tell, to take account of the consequences, to measure the importance.

Today I passed by Akadimias Street again, I can't avoid it. A smaller crowd of men was still there, doing the same thing. Meanwhile women had clearly come yesterday afternoon, when the men were taking their siesta, for flowers had been placed all along the fatal barrier.

I think I'll never see him again in the form of an old man. In Venice, he was simply wearing one of his disguises. Just as Zeus transformed himself into a rain of gold to take Danaë, the old man continually transforms himself, according to the circumstances, the place, the desire.

If he shows himself to me here, it is in the rough walls darkened by the filthy air of Athens; or in the soil -- a dry earth slightly dampened by the rain -- or in a cloud in the sky, cottony, curdled, grey; or in the noise of a motorbike, farting, coughing, spitting.

Each time, I know it's him, for he tells me the same thing in the same voice. 'Scratch, scratch,' he says. 'Scratch everything you can scratch!' And the word boils in the depths of his throat.

[]{#letters.html_page_25}I heard this voice nearly every day during the six months I was confined to bed in Gyzi. On the wall beside the bed, there was a large poster of his painting of Danaë. During the interminable hours lying there, I could either look through my window, which gave on to a second window, beyond which another life was being lived, or I could look at the telly (beyond which there was the pretence of other lives being lived), or I could look at his painting: a woman, nude, always the same, lying on a sheet with cushions around her.

A woman painted as from the inside and only clothed in her skin afterwards. The opposite of what Goya did when he undressed the Maja. The old man first put himself inside -- or behind -- the canvas, and from there he burrowed his way towards the visible surface of the body. In the case of both painters, it is the breasts which are revealing. In the Titian, you have to imagine being inside the body to feel the fullness of her right breast: its imperceptible shadow is evoked so minimally that you feel nothing, if you don't feel it from the inside. Yet this makes it all the more real, all the more quivering, all the more desirable.

Whereas in the Goya, the protuberance, the swelling, is too clear, too held up by a corsage which has disappeared, too visible, and therefore, oddly, not carnal. No?

The old man was avid. For cash, for women, for power, for more years to live. He was jealous of God. Angry. So he started to imitate him. He didn't only reproduce, like so many other painters, the appearance of things created by God, but he started to give these things, as God had done, a skin, []{#letters.html_page_26}a hide of fur, hair, fat, an epidermis, folds, wrinkles. (Or he did the opposite, he took off the covering of flesh, as in the *Flaying of Marsyas;* he cut it open to demonstrate the skill of his own flesh-art.)

No other artist gets so close to making us believe in the palpitating life of what he paints. And he gets there not only by copying nature, but equally by knowing how to turn the spectator's brain. He knows where *we* place the life, the warmth, the tenderness in his painted bodies.

Titian worked like Shakespeare. You have the impression, before their works, that an arm or a word can say everything, because, like magicians, they knew exactly where the human spirit loves to drown itself. In a way, they are greater than God, for they know everything about their fellow men and women! Hence their vengeance.

I imagine a picture he might have painted, as you once imagined a non-existent Frans Hals. It would show Eve being created from Adam's rib. Flesh coming out of flesh. God placing his hands on matter and bringing another life to life. The setting would be a forest where there are tree-trunks and a lot of moss. Two inert, naked forms in the mud, whose substance seems to be alive. Finally, the act of painting, continually repeated like fornication, becomes a body. Not a body like Pygmalion's, whose body is washed marble. Here the body can sometimes be obscene.

Eve born of Adam as the universe was born of God, as painting []{#letters.html_page_27}is born of Titian, as life can be born of art, as I was born of you, as Chloé was born of me.

So I have to tell you I see him everywhere, the old man, I see him even in your granddaughter, who is more beautiful than light, sweeter than fire, gentler than water. Already she has won over our death ...

*Love, Katya*

HAUTE SAVOIE

*Darling Kut*,

I've been reading Erwin Panofsky's book on the old man. Apart from Panofsky's erudition, he had a love for what men left behind as signs of their thoughts and feelings -- like that of an astronomer for the stars. So reading him, you enter a kind of stellar peace.

And two notions struck me. One about perception in general and the other about the old man and his tricks.

Perception never only takes in a single fact or a single series of facts. It's always receiving messages from a circuit or a whole field of energy. It picks up waves rather than particles. This is particularly pronounced when it concerns the perception of a work of art -- which is already such a nexus of energy. But it's true of all perception. Look at an animal listening or smelling. Its attention never has a *single* focus but *scans* a []{#letters.html_page_28}whole area. Why do I say this? Perhaps it explains the 'coincidence' of even simple perceptions.

For instance, I said the old man's hands made me think of a money-lender. I learn from Panofsky that Jacopo Bassano painted a portrait of Titian as the money-lender in his *Purification of the Temple*!

For instance, you write: 'I imagine a picture he might have painted. It would show Eve being created from Adam's rib. Flesh coming out of flesh. God placing his hands on matter and bringing another life to life.' And Panofsky quotes Baschini, who wrote about the old man in Venice in 1600, saying that when painting he used his figures 'like God when he created man'.

For instance -- in relation to what the old man told you about fur -- it seems that Titian's personal seal (trademark) showed a she-bear licking her cub into shape! And his motto was *Natura potentior ars* (art is more powerful than nature).

I was in Vienna recently -- a city I don't like, but in which nevertheless I feel at home. The capital of reincarnations! Whilst there I went again -- of course! -- to look at his *Nymph and Shepherd*. And for the hundredth time, I watched the hand caressing the nymph's right arm. Caressing is not the right word. Scratching is better, like he told you. Lightly, lightly scratching. And for the hundredth time, I said to myself: It *isn't* her own hand. Its anatomical position, its gesture and the fact that it appears to have a cuff, []{#letters.html_page_29}make it impossible. It's a roving hand which belongs to nobody.

Perhaps it was going to be her hand, and the old man painted it differently, making it less and less her hand. If so, he did it for a reason -- it was not clumsiness or shortsightedness. The touching of this hand is the centre of the whole painting. It is what the painting *came* to be about.

An act which is a gesture of calling, of farewell, of greeting? Perhaps all three. In any case, it's an act that came from the old man, not from the nymph.

In *Walk Me Home*, the unfinished film which Nella and Tim Neat and I made, William, at the end, gets out of bed, dresses, adjusts his tie in the hotel mirror, and, before leaving for good, goes and stands by the bed where Cloud is still sleeping. He is old, and Cloud is a much younger woman. He knows he has to go. In five minutes (this he doesn't know), he'll be dead. He puts out his hand to touch Cloud for the last time. As you know, I played the role of William, and at this moment the gesture I made (I realise now, but I wasn't thinking of it then) was *exactly* the gesture of the hand in the Vienna painting.

I see you in your snake-dress.

*With all my love for Chloé and Oresters and Snake, John*

[]{#letters.html_page_30}ATHENS

*John*,

So, you've got it into your head to see me as (to turn me into?) a serpent. As you wish it, I'm willing. I can be a serpent or something else. I'll play, imitate, and make believe. Like in the field -- remember? -- when I was a kid, and we stopped to picnic on our Sunday walks in the Jura. And I would mimic for you whoever or whatever I thought might amuse you.

But it is best with animals. We can identify with them so deeply. They are just close enough and just far enough away for it to be easy. They are the *other*, a little more the *other* than another person. And so they're easier to understand; they demand imagination, aim, identification, whereas people demand intelligence, mental calculation, abstractions. And the meaner the human world becomes -- the more people slip into egoism and the greed of despair -- the more the animals align themselves with us, becoming brothers, closer than our human brothers. In fact, when this happens, even nature, even the inorganic, offers a shelter to our imaginations. Nature comes closer, just as those who are called the closest become more distant.

Maybe this is somewhat comparable to why you felt at home in Vienna, the capital of reincarnations, as you call it. No towns are more densely populated with the relics of other lives than the cities of art -- Venice, Florence -- even New York. So in a way, Vienna has an 'animal-effect'. The city encourages inward journeys, projections, flights of imagination.

[]{#letters.html_page_31}Serpents! There's a man painted by Titian who to me is an animal: something between a snake and a lamb. He's in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and some people attribute his portrait to Giorgione. (You?) The sweetness of the picture is indeed Giorgionesque, but its animal side and its cunning make me think of Titian.

Look at his hand -- it's made of the same stuff as the hide on his back. Look at the curls near his ears, and you think of cattle.

His face, of course, belongs to the family of men painted by Titian. You remember I had the same feelings of a blood likeness shared by the women Titian painted. (Magdelenes, Venuses, Nymphs, Girls ...) For some reason he was haunted by an archetypal man and woman, an original Adam and Eve from his own Creation!

The man in Munich holds the same glove in his hand as the *Man with a Glove* in the Louvre. But tell me, what is that snake-hat in the background? Isn't it a Serpent?

In the *Nymph and Shepherd*, the nymph is lying on a fur -- just as I dreamed of doing, just as I still dream of doing! Not only on a fur: on a whole animal specially stripped for me, Katya, on a just-skinned Marsyas.

Inside herself, she then becomes an animal, rejoins nature and is welcome there. Maybe William's hand belongs to the animal, to nature, to Creation?

[]{#letters.html_page_32}Anyway, I envy her, how I envy her! Lying half turned away, facing the other world -- the world of the peach stone. There for ever on a canvas, at peace, still, placid in the music of nothing. Already immortal without even having had to live! Existing to be seen, yes, but only as her Creator decides -- exhibited and protected at the same time! Focus of the craziest phantasms and interpretations, lending herself to other minds yet, at the same time, unalterable, immutable.

Supposing when we are dead we are able to reincarnate in paintings or music, and not only in other human beings. Wouldn't it be better? Come to think of it, you don't have to die to do this. It's enough to make the effort now of joining the universe of objects! And what could be more peaceful?

It seems that on Mount Athos, where no woman is allowed to set foot, there's an inscription on one of the monasteries:

::: block
![Image](images/ent.jpg){height="42" width="452"}
:::

'If you die before dying, you do not die at the moment of death.'

*Take care. All my love, Kut*

[]{#letters.html_page_33}PARIS

*Kut*,

With the rendezvous which you suggest -- half turned away, resting on your arm, facing another world (the world of the peach stones), lying on Marsyas, peaceful, still, without a sound in the music of nothing, a rendezvous on the far side of waking up, with this rendezvous you'd seduce any man! And maybe that's why it's so much a painting about seduction. Not the shepherd seducing the nymph, or the nymph the shepherd. It's the two of them with the old man seducing anyone who passes. Seducing with the promise of seduction.

Today I'm sending you two postcards which are also about seduction. The portrait of the young Isabella d'Este. The old man painted her from imagination and from other portraits of her, when she was in fact sixty! And the *Girl in a Fur*, a portrait of a 'Venetian Courtesan'. The model was one of Titian's favourites at the time. When he painted it, he was forty-seven years old.

*All my love, John*

ATHENS

*John*,

The painting of Isabella d'Este is to me more like a floral arrangement, a composition of textures, than a portrait of []{#letters.html_page_34}a real noblewoman, closer to Arcimboldo than to Velasquez. Is this the result of painting a portrait from imagination instead of from a model?

What makes it strange, however, is that its thrust is neither metaphysical (as with Arcimboldo) nor decorative. Once again, he wants us to touch the stuff, to put our hand inside -- like Saint Thomas into the wound of Christ. He wants to make us feel it as palpable. And this is why dressed figures are sometimes nearer to nakedness than certain undressed ones. The more palpable, the more naked.

The epitome of such 'palpability' is reached when he combines naked flesh with thick fur, as on the second postcard. Here we're at the height of pictorial eroticism. We drown in it.

The paleness of flesh against the darkness of fur, hair married to the pearls within it, the breast with its scarcely visible transparency and its discretion, which is nothing else but invitation, the eyes darker than jewels, and, finally, the slash in the sleeve, whose opening, pointed at by her fingers, is luminous and curly, artless and affected. Everything here implies pleasure -- including the ring on the finger and the metal bracelet round the plump wrist.

Jewels remind us, don't they, of the pleasure we'll lose when we're dead, and how they and their precious stones will still be here? They console a body for its vulnerability. Come on, say the jewels, wear us and we'll lend you some of our immutability.

[]{#letters.html_page_35}(The way she holds her waist is consoling, too -- as if she were very gently rocking herself. I do exactly this after suffering some humiliation or slight abuse.)

Jewels function a little like the old man's art. They make flesh more flesh, they defy the raw perfection of nature, they mock mortality and they almost -- but not quite alas! -- reach eternity, from which everything comes and to which everything returns. Both his art and jewels are a human response to the arrogance of God, to God's monopoly in Creation, to his implacable running of our destinies.

*Love, K*.

TRAIN: GENEVA -- PARIS

*Kut*,

Might it be that all flesh is feminine -- even the flesh of men? Maybe what is specifically male are men's fantasies, ambitions, ideas, obsessions. Could their flesh be female?

*Love, John*

ATHENS

*John*,

Titian, painter of flesh and guts, their rumblings and liquids. Painter of hair and the tamed beast in man. Painter of the skin []{#letters.html_page_36}as an entry or exit -- like the shining surface of water for the diver, the surface to which he comes back after his dive to the depths of the body and its hidden organs, comes back with the secret of a *personality*. (Just look how much his portraits of men say about their inner life!)

So, you have come to think that all flesh is feminine! The idea is, God knows, merely the result of a vast and ancient plot! Of course flesh is not only feminine! Maybe if women throughout the centuries have remained desirable -- and you haven't grown tired of it! -- this is partly due to this persistent lie, as old as the world, which proposes that flesh is a feminine attribute. But it's a pure convention, whereby men use the bodies of women to speak of their own passive desires, their desire to behave with abandon, to lie suppliant on a bed. Men have delegated to women this aspect of lust. The woman's body has become, not only the object but also the *ambassador* of masculine desire. Or, rather, simply of desire, regardless of gender. (The skin of men, where it is soft -- have you noticed? -- is softer than the skin of women ...)

Everywhere, female figures arch and wiggle themselves to embody something that transcends the sexes. Danaë, the nymphs, Venus, and even Mary, who poses piously as she receives Gabriel's message, but who expresses exactly the same thing in each and every *Annunciation*: the desire that calls out, that begs, that offers its own vulnerability, its neck, its veins, its health (as in Dracula), its 'virtue' as the prudes would call it. Marsyas is a violent and extreme expression of the same passion. Of a wild fantasy for fusion. Apollo couldn't bear his desire for the satyr any longer! Both were []{#letters.html_page_37}male, both musicians. They had to meet under the skin, if not under the sheets. There you are: that is my version of the story! In other words, what Marsyas' torturers are waiting to look at is what you call feminine flesh!

In other words, if flesh became synonymous with femininity it was, I guess, less because of its texture than because man needed its qualities to express a hidden side of his own desire. The reason men have painted so many nudes is not only to enjoy being voyeurs, but to confess the unconfessable about themselves!

I believe that women became more attractive, more sexy when they were made to reveal indirectly this unavowed desire that both male and female share. They became beautiful when this prescription of universal sexuality was tattooed upon their white and flabby flesh!

Titian was the painter of flesh which commands rather than invites. 'Take me.' 'Drink me,' it orders. He may have disguised himself for me as an old man or as a dog, but he also disguised himself in women. Titian as Mary Magdalene, as Aphrodite!

And here I think we come close to something concerning his power: he wore the disguise of everything he painted. He was trying to be everywhere. Competing with God. He wanted to create from his palette nothing less than life, and to rule over the universe. And his despair (the doubt you asked about) was that he couldn't, like Pan, *be everything*. He could only create pictorially and wear disguises. His fear []{#letters.html_page_38}was of being only a man, not a god as well, not a woman as well, not a forest as well, not a mist, not a lump of earth. Of being only a man!

Danaë's breast -- so marvellous, so suggestive, and so impalpable -- reveals, at one and the same time, all the limits and the triumph of his pictorial creation when compared with God's.

*I love you, Katya*

PARIS

*Kut*,

Do you remember me telling you about La Polonaise? Bogena, she's called. She comes from a farm in eastern Poland. She came to Paris to work as a cleaner in people's flats -- often the flats of well-off Russian émigrés. Now she lives with Robert, who is an engineer, also from eastern Poland. Here in Paris, he works as a builder. Black labour. They live together in a studio flat in a suburb. Fifth floor -- no lift. The flat, which is no bigger than a caravan, has seventy, eighty paraffin lamps arranged like ikons along the walls. All of them were bought in flea markets, then repaired, cleaned, polished and given new wicks. When he comes home in the evening, Robert lights four or five of them, and they sit for a moment to watch the flames.

Two evenings ago, Bogena and Robert came to spend the evening because it was the Russian New Year. They brought []{#letters.html_page_39}red, crystal glasses as a present. And sausages and wine. Sitting at the table whilst they spoke Russian, I tried to draw Bogena. Not for the first time. I always fail, because her face is very mobile and I can't forget her beauty. And to draw well, you have to forget that.

It was long past midnight when they left. As I was doing my last drawing, Robert said 'This is your last chance tonight, just draw her, John, draw her like a man!' When they had gone, I took the least bad drawing and started working on it with colours -- acrylic. With four tubes, water, and my fingers. Suddenly, like a weather-vane swinging round because the wind has changed, the portrait began to look like something. Her 'likeness' now was in my head -- and all I had to do was to draw it out, not look for it. The paper tore. I rubbed on paint sometimes as thick as ointment. Her face began to lend itself to, to smile at, its own representation. At four in the morning, it smiled back at me.

Next day, the frail piece of paper, heavy with paint, still looked good. In the daylight, there were a few nuances of tone to change. Colours applied at night sometimes tend to be too desperate -- like shoes pulled off without being untied. Now it was finished.

From time to time during the day, I'd go and look at it: Bogena's face had made a present of what it could leave behind of itself.

But if my drawing had been a great one, it would have been even closer to the energy of Bogena's face. When I say *closer*, []{#letters.html_page_40}I don't mean more naturalistic or more faithful. All great works, the works that can hold us in their thrall indefinitely, are similarly *close* to what they are after. The old man's painting of dogs, one of Rothko's late, large paintings of a coloured glow, or a Hokusai drawing of a couple fucking, are all equally *close* to their aim. *They are as close as one can get*.

In theory, something could be closer (the distance is still considerable), but then there would be, could be, no image -- because at a closer distance, you can no longer separate, no longer resist the colossal gravitational pull of the 'model' -- whatever that model is, a pup, transcendent light, or the act of fucking. When you are so close that you are touching all the time, there can be no art. And when you are really far away, there's no energy in what is made, it's merely a ritual object, because there's no touching at all.

Having said all this about the intimacy from which images may be born, I come to your point about TOUCH, about which the old man knew everything. In the *Entombment*, Christ's body palpitates from within in the same way as Danaë's. But the painting evokes Pity instead of Desire. Desire and Pity. Strangely, both provoke a similar kind of touching! The old man knew this, too.

*Je t'embrasse, John*

[]{#letters.html_page_41}ATHENS

*John*

What makes a body seduce you, or a written page absorb you till you drown in it, or a canvas live, move, speak, and radiate until it draws you into its own space is, in each case, their special way of being themselves, of being inseparable from themselves. Of not giving a damn about the onlooker. Of not waiting on anyone else. Of being themselves as if they were alone in the world.

Such a power to seduce has a stance which is practically that of scorn towards the spectator and towards all codes, manners, and measures. Every onlooker, in face of such a power, is, by definition, an intruder, somebody who has surprised something in a state of total intimacy with itself, in a state of both truth and transparency.

What delights a man about the sensuality of a woman -- whether or not it involves the act of love -- is the way her gestures, her intonations, her prescience, derive from the depths of her being, from her childhood perhaps, from what she is in her own dreams, from how she may be when she is asleep alone! The man is overjoyed to have witnessed this. (What I say about men may be true about women, too, but I've more often asked myself what it is that has delighted the man lying beside me than the other way around, to the point where it sometimes seems I know men better than I know myself.) He has received a gift, or, let's say, he has had the nous to have taken in something which was private, buried, virgin.

[]{#letters.html_page_42}Each gesture of a woman is the sum of all her secret gestures, and a man's pleasure is being in on the secret. And the opposite? It seems to me that the woman's pleasure has more to do with her secret being discovered, with something in her which was buried and asleep being awakened. Maybe this is where 'Snow White', 'Sleeping Beauty', and other stories begin.

Far more than a man, she is like the page which invites, the canvas which appeals. This is maybe why her body has so often been represented in art. Not just because most of the artists were men, but because here there is something essential in the relation between the sexes: the woman inseparable from herself, and the man looking over her, finding pleasure in her immediacy!

Pictures by Rothko and Titian, but also by Courbet, possess this quality. They are so completely themselves that they contain all the *vertical* depth of their being. They exclude any reference to rule or obedience. Snapping their fingers at others, they simply exist with us or without us. We have an interest in discovering their secret and their inner truth, but they, they don't give a fuck, tyrannical as they are, faithful only to themselves, inevitable. They owe their existence only to themselves, tautologically! A little like God. (Hence perhaps the 'fatality' of *femmes fatales?*)

Titian here is the god behind God; his painting, like nature, has its own laws, delivers -- or doesn't deliver -- its own unsharable secrets, so true to itself that it needs no justification, no explanation, no story! It's there in front of us, clear, enigmatic, []{#letters.html_page_43}as solid as a mass of irrefutable matter, a pure product of itself -- in all its verticality!

Does this make any sense to you?

I believe the success of a painting depends far less on any closeness to its model, to what it aims at and represents, than on its closeness to a self, to the self's memory and gaze and truth. A painter painting is like a canvas which radiates, a page which invites, a woman who glows: he's faithful to himself: he filters nothing, he must stick to his own perception and imagination and his own five senses. If he dams up nothing, his secret will open on the surface of the canvas, and it's this, in all its nakedness, which will entice. If an artist is true to what lies deepest in him, like the coal at the bottom of a mine, his work invites.

I'm not preaching some magic, occult theory whereby artists should ignore technique and everyone is really a potential Picasso. Far from it. Simply, we are all capable of sensuality, aren't we, and a kind of inner transparency might make each of us more desirable.

Here, and certainly in art, a certain savoir-faire is indispensable. The thing is to play with the techniques one has acquired to re-become naive, to unlearn as well as learn. A cat is spell-binding by virtue of her natural grace alone. A ham actor turns you off with his tricks.

Art attracts and sweeps away with its mastery, but it's mastery put to the service of something naked, secret, true, virgin, []{#letters.html_page_44}never-before-seen -- something which almost comes from a violation. And art does this involuntarily; it can't do otherwise. It makes a hole in the paper -- like you with your drawing of Bogena.

There are people who know how to live like that, too. They learn, they quote, they consult, and all the while they stay in touch with their own essence. There remains something untreated and unconscious about them. When they listen, they are like wells; when they speak, they do so like fountains. When they move, it's like hearing a voice, and when they concentrate (shaving or tightening a screw or copying a poem), they give off the same mystery as a priest does performing a liturgy. The old man I met was like this. And you are, too. (Here I give away the clue to our correspondence.)

To be intimate is to re-find in oneself that which is most hidden and private; intimacy can also imply a marvellous, narrow relationship between two people. To be intimate is a way of listening to one's internal sense, of listening to one's own dialogue between the said and the unsaid. The second jubilant intimacy, the one which is (occasionally) shared, implies two listenings, two dialogues which overlap and couple.

To put it differently, my argument is that such intimacy is the sine qua non for any [INVITATION]{.small}, whether it concerns art or bodies or (probably) souls. And without the first -- intimacy with oneself -- no other is possible ...

[]{#letters.html_page_45}The late paintings of Titian are, I'm sure, the fruits of an individual intimacy. For him, whatever his disguise, for him, the man of power, the intimacy of feeding his art came from keeping marvellously in touch with his own truth.

Show me -- it's a challenge -- a painting which is the fruit of a shared intimacy between two people. Could you?

*Love, Katya*

PARIS

*Kut*,

You end your letter by challenging me to name a painting in which we see or are allowed to feel a shared, double intimacy -- that of painter and model, simultaneously.

Yes, it's rare but not, I think, as rare as all that. The Rubens of his wife, Hélène, with just a fur coat round her shoulders? The Caravaggio of the young man posing provocatively as Cupid? Several of Picasso's paintings of Marie-Thérèse Walter? Each of these is about a shared sexual intimacy, and the act of love is very near.

If one interprets intimacy in the wider sense of a shared and complicit openness in both parties (but without a sexual connotation), then there are certain icons by Rublev and a number of portraits by van Gogh in which the *thereness* of []{#letters.html_page_46}the model is complicit with the specific thereness of the painter's vision, both so distinctly themselves that one thinks of them as being naked.

Sensuality, you say, comes from a physical integrity, from a fidelity to the self in the body, and this is what attracts us -- whether we are watching a lover, an animal, or a painting. Attraction begins with the surprise of coming upon the original, as it was before the world's usage. And the art of attraction is the art of knowing this and of preserving what you name so beautifully as the vertical truth. Thus genius is comparable with a kind of natural grace.

Yet I want to add something disconcerting about the nature of the painter's contract with the visual. A contract that is never drawn up in clauses and that only consists of hunches. The visible waits to be seen. The visible is the painter's first companion!

The impulse to paint comes neither from observation nor from the inner self, but from an encounter, the energy coming from both painter and model -- even if the model is a mountain or a shelf of empty bottles. I cannot explain this, I just know that it's true, which is why it's disconcerting.

*Kisses, John*

[]{#letters.html_page_47}ATHENS

*John*,

OK. You win -- a meeting takes place halfway between the painter and what he's looking at. The promise of this meeting depends on a secret contract drawn up between the two of them. The miracle comes from doors being unbolted, from lock-gates being opened, and a fertilisation taking place. I still insist, however, that to open the doors and locks, the one who is looking, just as much as the one being looked at, has to be in a state of harmony, of grace, yes?

Yesterday I started work again. The same bus, no. 222 or no. 235, the same dirt, the same stale air, the same inoffensive roughness, the same belligerent spirit of this city which is like no other, and the impression you have of people and vehicles pushing and jumping in panic on top of each other, like sheep do when loaded into a lorry.

In the office the usual chaos. I chat with the girls who are sunburnt and full of remarks. And then, I work casually on a borrowed computer for an hour or so before leaving to pick up Chloé after school.

When I leave the building, I'm enveloped by the early September heat with its white, even light and its slight breeze, and an idea comes to me like a friend who comes up behind you and puts his hands over your eyes and asks you to guess who he is: the idea that this heat and this light, which are the rule in Athens from May to mid-June and from []{#letters.html_page_48}September to mid-October, abolish the frontier between inside and outside.

Of buildings, of course, but also of bodies. It's the same temperature out of doors as in the intimacy of a bedroom or in the tunnels of your veins. There are no more barriers or outlines. The whole world (physical and psychic) is a huge, seamless sheet -- but a three-dimensional one in which you are submerged. An aquarium in which everything is at the same time the inhabitant, the water, and the glass.

I pursued this line of thought, for I realised it has something to do with my vision of this country. It helped me to formulate what I feel about the people, the climate, the land, and the Greek way of thinking. The inside and the outside are one here, communicating. The other and the self are united. No fundamental difference. Everything exists in a state of homogeneity, coherence, solidarity, consistency. This doesn't mean that all realities and relations are harmonious and trouble-free. On the contrary. But everything is comprehensible, near, share-able, easy to imagine; everything is part of the same flux. 'You understand me, I understand you, you live this today, I will live it tomorrow, you know what it's like, your body sweats, mine also, I know what you're going through ...'

The earth, the sea, and the sky have shared out their empire. Old men stroll in pyjamas along the filthy street. Every evening, from the balcony opposite mine, comes semi-oriental music for the whole neighbourhood! The same dust is everywhere. Everybody talks like a mother to a child. Tummy rumblings []{#letters.html_page_49}are something universal. People recognise one another, not in accordance with any particular respect due, but in accordance with the common reality of their human bodies.

Each body is one body among others and equal with them. If someone comes forward, it is usually to represent the others -- like the coryphaeus of an antique chorus. This lack of politeness and civility, which so shocks foreigners, comes directly from a notion of democracy first formulated in ancient Greece. Why bother with formal gestures and hypocritical compliments when everyone is familiar with the needs, the feelings, and the thoughts of everyone else? All are part of the same chain, and each is potentially in the skin of another. When people act selfishly, they do so allowing for the selfishness of others.

Greeks start from the principle that they know themselves (not with their brains, like the French, but because they've lived). Armed with Socratic sayings, they extend their knowledge towards others. They go out to meet the outside because they've come to terms with what's inside.

They have no need to make themselves pretty or to wrap things up: the polite bows, the fashionable clothes, all forms of dressing up here have either been imported or artifically brought in by the Church or the powers that be. Otherwise, the Greeks' awareness of their own collectivity encourages a unique minimalism, to be seen in their buildings, in their social relations, in their cooking (the butchers simply display dead flesh), and in their everyday philosophy. The very complexity []{#letters.html_page_50}of life is simple for them. Everything is in everything. Their vases communicate.

As I'm thinking this, the bus no. 222 crosses a large building site, where work is being done on the future metro line. I notice a huge cement mixer. It has the word *Titan* printed on it. Straightaway I take these letters to be a sign (or an appeal?) from the old man. He's trying to tell me something. Urgently. At this moment. What does the sign with the 'I' missing mean? How to read it?

The *Flaying of Marsyas*, the fur portraits, the men with their dogs, the Magdalenes clothed in their own curls, naked among the rocks, the nymphs adopted by the forest, the sleeping courtesans dressed in their nudity, the hairs, the canvases of 'peach stone' -- doesn't all this belong to the same 'homogeneity'?

I'm tempted to call it a Classic homogeneity, for the 'inside-outness' comes not only from climate and geography but also from the heritage of the Classic philosophers, from a certain view of the cosmos, a certain acceptance, lost over the centuries in other countries less attached to tradition and more open to dissidence, schisms, and Progress.

Finally, in the old man's art one finds a frankness, a familiarity, which is the consequence of going backwards and forwards between the inside and the outside and of a kind of contempt for the frontier, seen as a heresy. It's as if both Titian and the people of this country assume their role as sinners and at the same time avidly bite into every forbidden fruit!

[]{#letters.html_page_51}They insist on continual communication between the two sides of any barrier; they refuse divisions and distinctions. In this Promethean attitude, there's an arrogance, a defiance, even an aggression; they usurp the prerogatives of the gods, and they pummel everything with their hands, ignoring any hierarchy.

Thus the timeless old man of the south was so faithful to his own instinct and senses that he brushed the world as if it belonged to him -- as if it was his own beard.

You find the same magnificent arrogance in Mayakovsky, in Fellini, in Courbet, in all those who wanted to eat the universe, who communed by interfering, and who gave by seizing.

When Titian looked, he saw himself. When he painted, he painted himself. And vice versa! All the barriers are down. When he makes gold rain on Danaë, it floods the world. And his art begins -- against all rational argument -- with the equivalence between the act of receiving and the act of spilling.

Looking at his paintings and seeing this triumph, we feel a sense of relief. So much joy and such a promise of a cosmic reconciliation take nearly all the weight off our shoulders. With the barriers down, we are swept away and consoled.

Could it be that beauty -- as distinct from that which stimulates intellectually and feeds on differences, alternatives, paradoxes, conventions being knocked down and rebuilt, []{#letters.html_page_52}categories continually being redefined, every kind of line drawn in order to separate -- could it be that beauty is born of a soup of everything mixed together, gushing out without any order or priority, its arm round the waist of life, and with none of the primness which comes from classifying -- could it be that beauty is born of coloured stuff spread out for the love of life?

Just as our brain likes to follow lines traced by rational thought, so our senses and our soul need the communion which begins with the rubbing out of those lines, and the abolition of any frontier between inside and outside, the self and the world, the sea and the earth, the Creation by God and the creation by a simple titan.

## *G*. {.h2}

[Winner of the Booker Prize\
Winner of the Guardian Fiction Prize]{.size}

In this luminous novel, John Berger relates the story of G., a modern Don Juan forging an energetic sexual career in Europe during the early years of the last century as Europe teeters on the brink of war.

With profound compassion, Berger explores the hearts and minds of both men and women, and what happens during sex, top reveal the conditions of the libertine's success: his essential loneliness, the quiet cumlation in each of his sexual experiences of all of those that precede it, the tenderness that infuses even the briefest of his encounters, and the way women experience their own extraordinariness through the liaisons with him. Set against the turbulent backdrop of Garibaldi's attempt to unite Italy, the failed revolution of Milanese workers in 1898, the Boer War and the dramatic first flight across the Alps, *G*. is a brilliant novel about the search for intimacy in the turmoil of history.

'The most interesting novel in English I have read for many years ... It is one of the few serious attempts of our time to do for the novel what Brecht did for drama: to reshape it in the light of twentieth-century experience ... A fine, humane and challenging book'\
*New Republic*

'A rich and pleasurable reading experience'\
*Guardian*

'To read *G*. is to find a writer one demands to know more about. Not to sit at the feet of his aphorisms or unravel the tangles of his allusions, but to explore more fully an intriguing and powerful mind and talent'\
*New York Times*

## *Pig Earth* {.h2}

With this haunting first volume of his *Into Their Labours* trilogy, John Berger begins his chronicle of the eclipse of peasant cultures in the twentieth century. Set in a small village in the French Alps, *Pig Earth*, relates the stories of sceptical, hard working men and fiercely independent women; of calves born and pigs slaughtered; of a message of forgiveness from a dead father to his prodigal son; and of the marvellous, indomitable Lucie Cabrol, exiled to a hut high in the mountains.

'Brilliant ... These stories have a remarkable sense of celebration'\
*Sunday Telegraph*

'*Pig Earth* is a relentlessly realist work ... Doggedly scrupulous in its detail, its sheer unshowy knowledgeability ... Berger is one of the few English writers who can interleave poems and political essays of equivalent intricacy'\
*New Statesman*

## *Once in Europa* {.h2}

In *Once in Europa*, part of the acclaimed *Into Their Labours* trilogy, John Berger paints a vivid portrait of two worlds -- a small Alpine village bound to the earth and its age-old traditions, and the restless, ephemeral, future-driven culture that is invading it -- at their moment of collision. The main instrument of entrapment and conflict, in these stories, is love. Lives are lost and hearts are broken, and yet, sometimes, love is a transcending form of grace.

'Berger's prose homes in on an intense and grainy view of the details of local life, and somehow transposes them into the patterns of a wider world'\
*Financial Times*

'Berger writes in an ethereal style, each sentence full of poetic prose'\
*Observer*

## *Lilac and Flag* {.h2}

As Dickens and Balzac did for their time, so John Berger does for ours, rendering the movement of a people and the passing of a way of life. In *Lilac and Flag*, the Alpine village of the two earlier volumes of the *Into Their Labours* trilogy has been forsaken for the mythic city of Troy. Here, amidst shanty-towns, factories, opulent hotels, fading heritages and steadfast dreams, the children and grandchildren of rural peasants pursue meagre livings as best they can. And two young lovers embark upon a passionate, desperate journey of love and survival and find transcending hope both for themselves and for us as their witnesses.

'Remarkable ... Like all great novelists John Berger guides his characters and readers tenderly and with intimate humour'\
Michael Ondaatje

'A magnificent trilogy ... Moving in an almost unbearable way'\
Anthony Burgess

## *And Our Faces, My Heart, Brief As Photos* {.h2}

This book -- call it a book of love letter meditating on place, mortality, art, love and absence -- is as breathtaking and spare as we have come to expect of John Berger. From his lyrical description of the works of Caravaggio, or the sight of a spray of lilac on a windowsill, to profound explorations of death and immigration, this is a beautiful and intimate response to our century.

'He handles thoughts the way an artist handles paint. His mind is spattered with colour ... His writing has a physical reality'\
*The Times*

'John Berger is genius invisible. His life's work is synonymous with the creation of unforgettable living portraits'\
*Scotsman*

## *Photocopies* {.h2}

In his new book John Berger traces in words moments lived in Europe at the end of the millennium. These moments are not fiction. They happened. As he wrote them Berger sometimes imagined a frieze of 'photocopies' arranged side by side, giving future readers a panoramic view of what this moment in history was like when lived. Each 'photocopy' is about somebody for whom Berger felt a kind of love, but the book also becomes an unintentional portrait of the author as well.

'This beautiful book bring non-fiction writing close to drawing -- the sort of drawing that both records and investigates ... Berger makes you believe in goodness: not an impossible state out of our reach, but a capacity in all of us to do with honesty, not faking. This is a marvelous book'\
*New Statesman*

'Awe-inspiring ... All the writing has a still, insistent beauty ... Berger sometimes manages a moment of absolute and truthful emotion, which can be extraordinary'\
*Observer*

## *To the Wedding* {.h2}

With an introduction by Nadeem Aslam

'No one knows more about the necessity of love than John Berger: what love makes us capable of, and incapable of. This is a book of the most precise humanity. No one who reads it will forget what it makes us understand: every action has its twin, conscionable or unconscionable; every truth, its shadow in the world; everything lost, alive in love'\
Anne Michaels

A mother and father, estranged for years, are travelling across Europe to their daughter's wedding. Vibrant, beautiful Ninon has fallen in love with the young Italian Gino. She is twenty-three years old -- and she is dying of AIDS. As their wedding approaches, the story of Ninon and Gino unfolds. On their wedding day, Ninon will take off her shoes and dance with Gino: they will dance as if they will never tire; as if their happiness is eternal; as if death will never touch them. *To the Wedding* is a novel of devastating heartache, soaring hope and above all, love that triumphs over death.

'A great, sad, and tender lyric, a novel that is a vortex of community and compassion that somehow overcomes fate and death'\
Michael Ondaatje

'A wonderful book, one which yields immediate pleasure and promises to stay long in the mind'\
*Sunday Times*

'The finale, the wedding itself, is a masterpiece ... This is a novel that will haunt you'\
*Sunday Telegraph*

'One of the greatest and most honest love stories of our time'\
Colum McCann

## *Here is Where We Meet* {.h2}

No one appreciates the detail of being alive more than the dead. In Lisbon, a man encounters his mother sitting on a park bench who laughs with the impudence of a schoolgirl. She has been dead for fifteen years. In Krakow market he recognises Ken, his *passeur*, the most important person in his life between the ages of eleven and seventeen. They last met when Ken was sixty-five -- forty years ago. The number of lives that enter any one life is incalculable. In this nomadic and playful book, which travels through fictions across Europe, seemingly disparate stories reveal themselves to be linked, mislaid objects find their place and sensual memories penetrate the present.

'A triumph ... Magical ... Peppered with unforgettable images, it makes us stop and take a breath. It makes us see the world afresh'\
*Guardian*

'Is there anyone today who has done more to change the way we look at art and its relationship to time, landscape and social life than Berger? ... He has created a body of work unrivalled in the breadth of forms and genres it spans, its sensuous intelligence, its radical humanism and its ceaseless commitment to carrying out E. M. Forster's famous injunction: "Only connect"'\
*Daily Telegraph*

## *About Looking* {.h2}

As a novelist, essayist and cultural historian, John Berger is a writer of dazzling eloquence and arresting insight whose work amounts to a subtle but powerful critique of the canons of our civilization. In *About Looking* he explores our role as observers to reveal new layers of meaning in what we see. How do the animals we look at in zoos remind us of a relationship between man and beast all but lost in the twenty-first century? What is it about looking at war photographs that doubles their already potent violence? How do the nudes of Rodin betray the threats to his authority and the potency posed by clay and flesh? And how does solitude inform the art of Giacometti? In asking these and other questions, Berger alters the vision of everyone who reads his work.

'I admire and love John Berger's books. He writes about what is important, not just interesting ... A wonderful artist and thinker' Susan Sontag

'Berger is a writer one demands to know more about ... An intriguing and powerful mind and talent'\
*New York Times*

## *The Shape of a Pocket* {.h2}

'The pocket in question is a small pocket of resistance. A pocket is formed when two or more people come together in agreement. The resistance is against the inhumanity of the new world economic order. The people coming together are the reader, me and those the essays are about -- Rembrandt, Palaeolithic cave painters, a Romanian peasant, ancient Egyptians, an expert in the loneliness of hotel bedrooms, dogs at dusk, a man in a radio station. And unexpectedly, our exchanges strengthen each of us in our conviction that what is happening to the world today is wrong, and that what is often said about it is a lie. I've never written a book with a greater sense of urgency' John Berger

'An epic parable'\
*Independent*

'He handles thoughts the way an artist handles paint. His mind is spattered with colour. These essays smell of oil and resin and sweat, not only because they are about painters, but because his writing has a physical reality'\
*The Times*

## *John Berger: Selected Essays* {.h2}

[Edited by Geoff Dyer]{.size}

John Berger's diverse achievements as a writer are widely recognized. As well as plays, novels, short stories and poetry, he has always written essays, expressing more than forty years of tireless intellectual enquiry and fierce political engagement. Polemical, meditative, radical, always original ('The moment at which a piece of music begins provides a clue to the nature of all art') Berger's essays are also extremely wide-ranging. Photographers, artists, thinkers and peasants, zoos, museums and cities he has travelled to are among his subjects, sometimes within the space of a single essay.

The occasion of his seventy-fifth birthday in November 2001 provides the opportunity to pay tribute to the rich variety of Berger's ideas and concerns. Viewed chronologically, this collection does not simply show how his views have changed or his thought has evolved, it can also be seen as a kind of vicarious autobiography and a history of our time as seen through the prism of art.

The central concerns that have underpinned all Berger's writing are the enduring mystery of great art and the lived experience of the oppressed, preoccupations that are amply demonstrated here in Geoff Dyer's thoughtful selection from *Permanent Red, The Moment of Cubism, The Look of Things, About Looking, The White Bird* and *Keeping a Rendezvous*. If you have never read John Berger before, then this book is a good place to start.
