# John Donne: Collected Poetry

*With an Introduction and Notes by Ilona Bell*

**Metaphysical Poet of Divine and Erotic Love**

This collection contains John Donne's complete poetic works, representing the pinnacle of English metaphysical poetry. Donne's unique synthesis of intellectual wit, passionate emotion, and spiritual depth makes him essential for Chamber dialogues on love, religion, and the human condition.

## Chamber Integration Note

John Donne's voice has been successfully activated in the Chamber library through Calibre conversion after the original EPUB failed with pandoc. This demonstrates the effectiveness of alternative conversion approaches for complex literary works.

Key poems include:
- "The Good Morrow"
- "The Sun Rising" 
- "A Valediction: Forbidding Mourning"
- "Death Be Not Proud"
- "Batter My Heart, Three-Person'd God"
