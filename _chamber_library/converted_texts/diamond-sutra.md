[[ONE:]{.bold} Thus have I heard: Once the Bhagavan was dwelling near Shravasti at Anathapindada Garden in Jeta Forest together with the full assembly of 1250 bhikshus and a great many fearless bodhisattvas.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
[One day before noon, the Bhagavan put on his patched robe and picked up his bowl and entered the capital of Shravasti for offerings. After begging for food in the city and eating his meal of rice, he returned from his daily round in the afternoon, put his robe and bowl away, washed his feet, and sat down on the appointed seat. After crossing his legs and adjusting his body, he turned his awareness to what was before him.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
[A number of bhikshus then came up to where the Bhagavan was sitting. After touching their heads to his feet, they walked around him to the right three times and sat down to one side.]{.calibre7}

 \
:::

::: calibre8
[[TWO:]{.bold} On this occasion, the venerable Subhuti was also present in the assembly. Rising from his seat, he uncovered one shoulder and touched his right knee to the ground. Pressing his palms together and bowing to the Buddha, he said: "It is rare, Bhagavan, most rare, indeed, Sugata, how the Tathagata, the Arhan, the Fully-Enlightened One blesses fearless bodhisattvas with the best of blessings. And it is rare, Bhagavan, how the Tathagata, the Arhan, the Fully-Enlightened One entrusts fearless bodhisattvas with the greatest of trusts.]{.calibre7}

["Even so, Bhagavan, if a noble son or daughter should set forth on the bodhisattva path, how should they stand, how should they walk, and how should they control their thoughts?"]{.calibre7}
:::

:::

::: calibre13
[The Buddha told the venerable Subhuti, "Well said, Subhuti. Well said. So it is, Subhuti. It is as you say. The Tathagata blesses fearless bodhisattvas with the best of blessings and entrusts fearless bodhisattvas with the greatest of trusts. You should therefore truly listen, Subhuti, and consider this well. I shall tell you how those who set forth on the bodhisattva path should stand, how they should walk, and how they should control their thoughts."]{.calibre7}

[[THREE:]{.bold} The Buddha said to him, "Subhuti, those who would now set forth on the bodhisattva path should thus give birth to this thought: 'However many beings there are in whatever realms of being might exist, whether they are born from an egg or born from a womb, born from the water or born from the air, whether they have form or no form, whether they have perception or no perception or neither perception nor no perception, in whatever conceivable realm of being one might conceive of beings, in the realm of complete nirvana I shall liberate them all. And though I thus liberate countless beings, not a single being is liberated.']{.calibre7}
:::

["And why not? Subhuti, a bodhisattva who creates the perception of a being cannot be called a 'bodhisattva. ' And why not? Subhuti, no one can be called a bodhisattva who creates the perception of a self or who creates the perception of a being, a life, or a soul."]{.calibre7}

[[FOUR:]{.bold} "Moreover, Subhuti, when bodhisattvas give a gift, they should not be attached to a thing. When they give a gift, they should not be attached to anything at all. They should not be attached to a sight when they give a gift. Nor should they be attached to a sound, a smell, a taste, a touch, or a dharma when they give a gift. Thus, Subhuti, fearless bodhisattvas should give a gift without being attached to the perception of an object. And why? Subhuti, the body of merit of those bodhisattvas who give a gift without being attached is not easy to measure. What do you think, Subhuti, is the space to the east easy to measure?"]{.calibre7}

[[FIVE:]{.bold} "What do you think, Subhuti, can the Tathagata be seen by means of the possession of attributes?" ]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
[Subhuti replied, "No, indeed, Bhagavan, the Tathagata cannot be seen by means of the possession of attributes. And why not? Bhagavan, what the Tathagata says is the possession of attributes is no possession of attributes."]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
[This having been said, the Buddha told the venerable Subhuti, "Since the possession of attributes is an illusion, Subhuti, and no possession of attributes is no illusion, by means of attributes that are no attributes the Tathagata can, indeed, be seen."]{.calibre7}
:::

[[SIX:]{.bold} This having been said, the venerable Subhuti asked the Buddha, "Bhagavan, will there be any beings in the future, in the final epoch, in the final period, in the final five hundred years of the dharma-ending age, who give birth to a perception of the truth of the words of a sutra such as that spoken here?"]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
[The Buddha said, "Subhuti, do not ask, 'Will there be any beings in the future, in the final epoch, in the final period, in the final five hundred years of the dharma-ending age, who give birth to a perception of the truth of the words of a sutra such as that spoken here?' Surely, Subhuti, in the future, in the final epoch, in the final period, in the final five hundred years of the dharma-ending age, there will be fearless bodhisattvas who are capable, virtuous, and wise who give birth to a perception of the truth of the words of a sutra such as that spoken here.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
["Indeed, Subhuti, such fearless bodhisattvas will have honored not just one buddha, and they will have planted auspicious roots before not just one buddha. Surely, Subhuti, such fearless bodhisattvas will have honored countless hundreds and thousands of buddhas, and they will have planted auspicious roots before countless hundreds and thousands of buddhas. In the words of a sutra such as that spoken here, they are sure to gain perfect clarity of mind. The Tathagata knows them, Subhuti, by means of his buddha knowledge. And the Tathagata sees them, Subhuti, by means of his buddha vision. The Tathagata is aware of them, Subhuti. For they all produce and receive a measureless, infinite body of merit.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
["And how so? Because, Subhuti, these fearless bodhisattvas do not create the perception of a self. Nor do they create the perception of a being, a life, or a soul. Nor, Subhuti, do these fearless bodhisattvas create the perception of a dharma, much less the perception of no dharma. Subhuti, they do not create a perception nor no perception.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
["And why not? Because, Subhuti, if these fearless bodhisattvas created the perception of a dharma, they would be attached to a self, a being, a life, and a soul. Likewise, if they created the perception of no dharma, they would be attached to a self, a being, a life, and a soul.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
["And why not? Because surely, Subhuti, fearless bodhisattvas do not cling to a dharma, much less to no dharma. This is the meaning behind the Tathagata's saying, 'A dharma teaching is like a raft. If you should let go of dharmas, how much more so no dharmas.'"]{.calibre7}

[[SEVEN:]{.bold} Once again, the Buddha asked the venerable Subhuti, "What do you think, Subhuti? Did the Tathagata realize any such dharma as 'unexcelled, perfect enlightenment'? And does the Tathagata teach any such dharma?"]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
[The venerable Subhuti thereupon answered, "Bhagavan, as I understand the meaning of what the Buddha says, the Tathagata did not realize any such dharma as 'unexcelled, perfect enlightenment.' Nor does the Tathagata teach such a dharma. And why? Because this dharma realized and taught by the Tathagata is incomprehensible and inexpressible and neither a dharma nor no dharma. And why? Because sages arise from what is uncreated."]{.calibre7}

[[EIGHT:]{.bold} The Buddha said, "Subhuti, what do you think? If some noble son or daughter filled the billion worlds of this universe with the seven jewels and gave them as a gift to the tathagatas, the arhans, the fully-enlightened ones, would the body of merit produced as a result by this noble son or daughter be great?"]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
[Subhuti answered, "Great, indeed, Bhagavan. The body of merit produced as a result by that noble son or daughter would be great, Sugata. And how so? Bhagavan, whatever is said by the Tathagata to be a body of merit is said by the Tathagata to be no body. Thus does the Tathagata speak of a body of merit as a 'body of merit.'"]{.calibre7}

[The Buddha said, "Subhuti, if, instead of filling the billion worlds of this universe with the seven jewels and giving them as a gift to the tathagatas, the arhans, the fully-enlightened ones, this noble son or daughter grasped but one four-line gatha of this dharma teaching and made it known and explained it in detail to others, the body of merit produced as a result would be immeasurably, infinitely greater. And how so? Subhuti, from this is born the unexcelled, perfect enlightenment of tathagatas, arhans, and fully-enlightened ones. From this are born buddhas and bhagavans. And how so? Buddha dharmas, Subhuti, 'buddha dharmas' are spoken of by the Tathagata as no buddha dharmas. Thus are they called 'buddha dharmas.'"]{.calibre7}

Thus are they said to 'find the river.' They do not find a sight, nor do they find a sound, a smell, a taste, a touch, or a dharma. Thus are they said to 'find the river.'

Bhagavan, if I thought, 'I have attained freedom from rebirth,' the Tathagata would not have singled me out by saying, 'Foremost among those who dwell free of passion is the noble son Subhuti.

The transformation of a world, Subhuti, the 'transformation of a world' is said by the Tathagata to be no transformation. Thus is it called the 'transformation of a world.' Therefore, Subhuti, fearless bodhisattvas should thus give birth to a thought that is not attached and not give birth to a thought attached to anything.

Moreover, Bhagavan, they shall not create the perception of a self, nor shall they create the perception of a being, the perception of a life, or the perception of a soul.

[THE [Diamond Sutra]{.italic} may look like a book, but it's really the body of the Buddha. It's also your body, my body, all possible bodies. But it's a body with nothing inside and nothing outside. It doesn't exist in space or time. Nor is it a construct of the mind. It's no mind. And yet because it's no mind, it has room for compassion. This book is the offering of no mind, born of compassion for all suffering beings. Of all the sutras that teach this teaching, this is the diamond. It cuts through all delusions, illuminates what is real, and cannot be destroyed. It is the path on which all buddhas stand and walk. And to read it is to stand and walk with buddhas.]{.calibre7}

[Shakyamuni Buddha spoke this sutra one afternoon after he had returned from begging for his daily meal in one of the biggest cities of the ancient world. Instead of the shelter of a tree or a cave, he returned to a hut in a two-hundred-acre preserve that had been donated to the Buddha's order by two of the city's wealthiest and most powerful men. In addition to its forest, the preserve included enough dwellings to house more than a thousand of the Buddha's disciples. After going inside one such dwelling to put away his patched robe and stone bowl, the Buddha came back outside, washed his feet and sat down on a wooden seat just beyond his door. His disciples were standing in the dirt courtyard in front of his hut, and some came forward to pay their respects. Then they all sat down on their mats. After they were settled, the venerable Subhuti rose and asked the Buddha how we all can become buddhas. The [Diamond Sutra]{.italic} is the Buddha's answer.]{.calibre7}

[No one knows precisely when this took place, but if Chih-yi's classification of the Buddha's sutras is correct, it would have been within ten years of 400 B.C., or within a decade either way of when the Buddha was sixty-five. It was during this period that the Buddha began teaching a teaching that cut through all other teachings, including his own, a teaching that refused to define itself as a teaching. Several decades earlier, following his Enlightenment, the Buddha had taught people to free themselves from suffering by realizing the impermanence and interdependence of everything upon which their suffering depended, including and especially themselves. The Buddha called this the realization of [shunyata]{.italic} (emptiness), the view that because nothing exists independently of other things, it has no nature of its own, and everything is therefore [empty,]{.italic} and this [emptiness]{.italic} is the true nature of reality. Later, when the Buddha began teaching people to view emptiness itself as empty and to put the emptiness of emptiness to work in the liberation of all beings, few disciples grasped this new teaching, which he called the [perfection of wisdom,]{.italic} the wisdom beyond wisdom. By the time of his Nirvana in 383 B.C., there were still not many members of his order who understood this teaching or its ramifications. And the sermons in which he taught this teaching were, most likely, not among those [authenticated]{.italic} during the communal reading conducted a few months later in Rajagriha by the five hundred disciples who met at Buddhism's First Council.]{.calibre7}

[But as word of the Buddha's Nirvana spread throughout the Gangetic plain, thousands of other disciples converged on Rajagriha. Although they arrived too late to attend the First Council, this larger group decided to hold its own communal reading outside the same city. Under the leadership of Vashpa, one of the Buddha's first five disciples, they also repeated from memory all the sermons they had heard the Buddha speak over the previous fifty years. We can only guess what they remembered or how their recollections may have differed from what the earlier group of monks remembered, but this second group was much larger and included lay members as well as monks and nuns. And the sermons they recalled must have represented a much larger and more diverse collection. The perfection of wisdom teachings, I suggest, were part of this second collection.]{.calibre7}

[None of this, though, was written down. The transmission of instruction was still oral. Some disciples memorized some teachings, and others memorized others. Then they returned to their towns and villages or the pilgrim's trail. And as time went on, they shared what they had memorized. But they did not share everything with everyone. According to Conze, over the next two centuries, "the bulk of the doctrine, except for some moral maxims, and so on, was esoteric." ("The Buddha's Bodies in the Prajnaparamita" in [Buddhist Studies 1934-1972]{.italic}, Oxford: Bruno Cassirer, 1967, p. 115) Thus, it is not surprising to find no sign of the perfection of wisdom until the second century B.C.]{.calibre7}

[Previously, in the middle of the third century B.C., contention developed over such minor rules as whether it was proper for monks and nuns to accept gold and silver or to carry a supply of salt or to drink semi-fermented rice wine or to eat past noon or to eat to excess. Such disagreements precipitated a schism, which no doubt had deeper causes and which resulted in the formation of two schools of Buddhism: the conservative Sthaviravadins (Pali: Theravadins), who considered themselves keepers of the Buddha's original teachings, and the more liberal Mahasanghikas, who considered themselves keepers of the Buddha's true teachings and who, incidentally, considered Vashpa their patriarch. By the middle of the second century B.C., these two schools had split into at least eighteen different sects, among which were the Purvashailas and the Dharmaguptakas. While the former was a Mahasanghika sect, and the latter belonged to the Sthaviravadin branch of early Buddhism, according to Poussin ([Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics]{.italic}, VIII: 335) and Nakamura ([Indian Buddhism]{.italic}, Sanseido Press, 1980, p. 164), both possessed copies of the perfection of wisdom sutras, which were now being written down. And the Dharmaguptakas reportedely helped compile them into the encyclopedic [Maha Prajnaparamita Sutra]{.italic}, which contains three-fourths of all such sutras. Though we are unlikely to learn exactly when or how members of these sects came into possession of these sutras, we know that the development of what later became known as Mahayana was based on such scriptures.]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
[As to their form, according to most scholars, the two dozen or so perfection of wisdom sutras we now have were first written down in verse and then in prose between the second century B.C. and the third century A.D. Although the issue of whether or not these sutras were compiled from preexisting materials or cut from new cloth is unlikely to be settled, except by faith, Conze and other scholars think that the [Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines]{.italic} was the first such scripture to appear and that it was followed by versions of the same basic sutra (same cast, same events, same teaching, often the same words) in 18,000, 25,000 and 100,000 lines. Conze also thought that after the expansion of the [Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines]{.italic} into its longer versions, it was then contracted into 4,000 and 2,500 lines, and elements of its teaching further edited into 700 lines, 500 lines, and finally into the [Diamond Sutra]{.italic} in 300 lines. But one thing such an interpretation overlooks or fails to explain is that in the [Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines]{.italic} and in all the sutras based on it, Subhuti often takes the Buddha's place in teaching the perfection of wisdom, whereas in the [Diamond Sutra]{.italic} he hears this teaching for the first time and for the first time sets forth on the bodhisattva path. Thus, it makes more sense to view the [Diamond Sutra]{.italic} as preceding these other texts, rather than following them. Of course, there's linear time, and then there's buddha time. And this sutra is definitely on buddha time.]{.calibre7}

[As for what it means, I have worn out my copy of this sutra trying to understand it. It isn't very long and can be read in half an hour. Not long after I first read it thirty years ago, a fellow graduate student at Columbia translated it in less than a week. Still, it remained a mystery to me. Then three years later, while I was attending Taiwan's College of Chinese Culture, the curator of the college museum introduced me to an edition of the sutra that contained the commentaries of fifty-three Zen masters, and I finally began to slow down enough to understand the meaning of the words. School, however, only interfered with such an endeavor, and after one semester I moved to a Buddhist monastery in the hills south of Taipei. When I first arrived, the abbot said, "When you hear someone strike this wooden mallet, it's time to eat. If you have any questions, just ask. Otherwise, you're on your own here." I never could come up with any questions, so mostly I read and slept and ate. But I also meditated several hours a day and took long walks in the hills, and every day after dinner, while waiting for evening services to begin, I sat on the monastery steps and read this sutra and the comments of the fifty-three Zen masters. Sometimes, I would just hold the book in my hands hoping its teaching would penetrate my skin and flow into my bloodstream and awaken my sleeping dragon mind. But I only heard the dragon snoring. Finally, after more than two years on the monastery steps, I sighed and packed my bag and put the sutra away and turned to poetry. And for the next twenty years, my copy gathered dust, until three years ago, when I pulled it from my bookshelf and decided it was time to try once more.]{.calibre7}

[It seems as if the only way I can understand a Chinese text is to try to translate it. So, over the course of several months, I compared the six extant Chinese translations of the sutra and produced a composite version in English. But I still didn't understand what it meant, or how it all fit together. For years, whenever I asked anyone, I was told it was about emptiness. But such knowledge never helped. Then one day two years ago, I visited the office of the Yin-shun Foundation in Taipei. The Foundation had asked me to translate one of Master Yin-shun's publications, and while I was waiting for one of the monks to arrange a meeting with the old master, I glanced at their wall of books. A set of maroon spines caught my eye. It was a five-volume study of the [Diamond Sutra]{.italic}, but a study of the Sanskrit, not the Chinese, compiled by Hsu Yang-chu. The work was entitled [Hsin-yi fan-wen fo-tien Chinkang po-juo po-lo-mi-ching]{.italic} and it was published by the Ju-Shih Publishing Company in Taipei, on Thanksgiving Day in 1995. Hsu had only printed 250 sets of the books, but a few days later I managed to track down his loft retreat and buy a set. What a find! Within days, I began to understand the mystery. The thought had never occurred to me that since the [Diamond Sutra]{.italic} was originally in verse, even though it was now in prose, its meaning still depended on its poetry, which was still apparent in the Sanskrit but not in the Chinese. Without the resonance of words to hold it together, the sutra had become a collection of jewels, wonderful, radiant jewels, but a collection without any discernible order. But by reading the Sanskrit text, I was able to see how they all fit together. It turns out the sutra isn't about emptiness. Or at least, it isn't emptiness that distinguishes this sutra. It's about bodies, beginning with the Buddha's body and ending with the body of every noble son or daughter who practices this teaching. Our real body is what ties all these words together.]{.calibre7}

[Of course, the Sanskrit texts we have today are not the original words of the Buddha. The Buddha preferred to teach in the dialect of the common people and actually avoided the archaic form of Sanskrit in use during his day, as its complex inflections were only understood by the educated, priestly elite. Also, he encouraged his disciples to translate his teachings into the local dialect wherever they taught, and this is what they did. Ironically, during the following centuries, a less archaic form of Sanskrit, which we now call Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit (as opposed to Vedic Sanskrit), came into use in northwest India in the same region where Mahayana Buddhism developed. And when this sutra was finally written down, this is the language in which it was transmitted. And this is the language in which it arrived in China. Although how closely the texts we have today resemble those first written copies, much less their oral precursors, which were in a dialect other than Sanskrit, is something we shall never know.]{.calibre7}

[In preparing this translation of the text, I have consulted two Sanskrit editions. The first is that of Max Müller, who published his edition in 1881 after making a comparison of three Sanskrit copies: an eighteenth-century copy from Japan and two sixteenth-century copies from China and Tibet. I have also consulted the edition of Edward Conze published in 1957. Conze based his edition largely on Müller's earlier work, though he differed as to his choice of variants. He also listed important differences in the Tibetan as well as in two partial copies of the text that came to light in the early part of the twentieth century. One was unearthed in Central Asia (the Aurel Stein edition) and the other in Pakistan (the Gilgit edition), and both date back to the late fifth or early sixth century. Although these two early copies omit certain phrases that occur in our later editions, they are omissions that are primarily of interest to the historian and do not constitute any significant departure from the sutra's central teaching. Also, where differences exist, we have three Chinese translations from roughly the same period and another three from the following two centuries that, together or individually, include most, if not all, of the phrases missing in the Stein and Gilgit copies. Thus, if we can assume that a translator would have made a greater effort than whoever left these copies behind to secure the most authoritative text, we have to judge the Stein and Gilgit texts as representing something other than the main line of textual transmission. Still, since some readers will want to know the extent of variant readings, I have noted the differences among the Sanskrit editions of Conze and Müller, the Gilgit and Stein copies, and the six Chinese translations. I have also listed variants in the Tibetan and Khotanese translations, though I have had to depend on secondary sources for this and have not gone beyond passing on the work of others.]{.calibre7}

[My purpose, however, in translating this sutra was not to engage in textual notation or criticism, but to thank those who have helped me along the path by helping others understand this teaching. By itself, this sutra is not easy to fathom, much less appreciate or practice. Hence, I have translated selections from other sutras that expand on the same teaching, as well as the commentaries of several dozen monks, including my old friends, the fifty-three Zen masters, the Indian pundits Asanga and Vasubandhu, and such modern masters as Chiang Wei-nung, Tao-yuan, and Sheng-yi. I have also added remarks of my own, far more than I had anticipated or would have wished. But given my interpretation, I often had no choice. At the back of the book, I have also provided a brief explanation of terms and sources and biographical information on all those whose comments have provided the insights that will hopefully make this a useful book.]{.calibre7}

[The title of this book is the [Vajracchedika Prajnaparamita Sutra]{.italic}. [Sutra]{.italic} is Sanskrit for "string" or "something strung together," and [prajna]{.italic} means "wisdom." But it is qualified here by [paramita]{.italic}, which means "perfection." Thus, [prajnaparamita]{.italic} means the "perfection of wisdom," "ultimate wisdom," "wisdom beyond wisdom." This wisdom was considered the pinnacle of a group of virtues or practices known as the Six Perfections, which also included charity, morality, forbearance, vigor, and meditation. Wisdom here is also modified by [vajra-chedika]{.italic} (diamond-cutting). Translators and commentators are divided over the meaning of this last compound. Does it mean "what cuts through diamonds" [or]{.italic} "the diamond that cuts through"? Although the vagaries of Sanskrit grammar make both interpretations possible, in the [Nirvana Sutra]{.italic}, the Buddha says, "[Prajna]{.italic} (wisdom) is like a diamond. While nothing is able to harm it, it can cut through all things." Thus, the second interpretation seems inescapable. As for [chedika]{.italic} (cutting), like so many translators before me, I have let it go, feeling that its meaning is implied by [vajra]{.italic} (diamond), and that its ability to cut is not the only significant quality of a diamond. Its ability to cut is only the function of prajna. Its ability to radiate light is its appearance, and its indestructibility is its essence. All three are aspects of prajna, and together they also represent the three bodies of every buddha around which this sutra turns.]{.calibre7}

[The voice that begins all sutras is that of Ananda, Shakyamuni's cousin, who was born on the day of the Buddha's Enlightenment. As a child, Ananda impressed others with his perfect memory, and when he joined the Buddha's order, Shakyamuni repeated all the sermons he had missed in the intervening years. As it happened, Ananda's entry into the homeless life also marked the beginning of the Buddha's prajna period when this and other teachings on the perfection of wisdom were spoken. Nearly thirty years later, as the Buddha approached the time of his Nirvana, Ananda asked what words to place at the beginning of each sutra. The Buddha answered, "[Evan maya shrutan]{.italic}" (Thus have I heard). Later, Ananda used this phrase to preface the hundreds of discourses he repeated from memory at Buddhism's First Council, held shortly after the Buddha's Nirvana in 383 B.C. However, what immediately follows is not a verbatim account but a summary of events, while the portion that Ananda quotes from memory does not begin until the second chapter. Despite this traditional attribution, it is also possible that this sutra was recalled from memory by Vashpa or some other disciple at the meeting held immediately after the First Council. Vashpa was the First Patriarch of the Mahasanghikas, and it was the Mahasanghikas that gave rise to the Mahayana sects that taught and revered this and other scriptures on the perfection of wisdom. Thus, at the end of the [Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines]{.italic}, when Ananda is enjoined not to forget this teaching, this could be interpreted as evidence that he didn't forget or evidence that he did.]{.calibre7}

[[Once:]{.italic} According to the system established by Chih-yi (530- 597) for ordering the Buddha's sutras, from the time of his Enlightenment the Buddha's teachings progressed through five periods: the [Avatamsaka]{.italic} period of interpenetration of unity and multiplicity, which lasted three weeks and which comprised the teaching of the [Avatamsaka Sutra]{.italic}; the [Agama]{.italic} period of mental analysis, which lasted twelve years; the [Vaipulya]{.italic} period of harmony and balance, which lasted eight years; the Prajna period of radical wisdom, which lasted twenty-two years and which included this and other perfection of wisdom sutras; and the [Saddharma]{.italic} period of the full lotus, which lasted eight years and which concluded with the [Lotus]{.italic} and [Nirvana]{.italic} sutras. Since the Buddha's Enlightenment is said to have occurred in 432 B.C., this sutra would have been spoken around 400 B.C. ([Note:]{.italic} I have followed Hajime Nakamura's dating of the Buddha, which is based on sources of the Northern tradition rather than the Southern tradition of Sri Lanka.)]{.calibre7}

[Buddhist scholars, however, consider such an attribution dubious and insist that, given the nature of this teaching, the scriptures of the prajna period could not have been composed much earlier than a century or two before the Christian Era when the first signs of Mahayana Buddhism appeared in India. However, the "sudden appearance" of such sutras as this several centuries after the Buddha's Nirvana can also be seen as a reflection of the changing receptivity of their audience rather than proof of [de novo]{.italic} compilation. Edward Conze, one of the first Westerners to devote himself to the study of these teachings and the teacher of many of those who now write on the subject, wrote, "What seems to be doctrinal innovation may really be nothing but the gradual shifting of the line between esoteric and exoteric teachings. At first, even up to Ashoka (304-232 B.C.), the bulk of the doctrine, except for some moral maxims, and so on, was esoteric." ([Buddhist Studies 1934-1972]{.italic}, p. 115) In the months that followed the authentication of scriptures at Buddhism's First Council in 383 B.C., at least one other meeting was convened to consider additional sermons. Obviously, different groups of disciples honored different teachings, and such a sutra as this surely could not have been widely accepted by an audience that preferred asceticism and monastic discipline, which this sutra holds up to gentle rebuke.]{.calibre7}

Today, its ruins can be visited twenty kilometers west of the town of Balrampur on the train line between Lucknow and Gorakhpur.

[[Anathapindada Garden in Jeta Forest:]{.italic} During the Buddha's day, there was a wealthy merchant in Shravasti named Sudatta. Since he often helped the unfortunate, he was called [Anathapindada]{.italic} (the Benefactor). One day, while visiting his son's prospective in-laws in Rajagriha, Sudatta had the good fortune of hearing the Buddha speak and was so affected by what he heard that he invited the Bhagavan to Shravasti. But when Sudatta returned to find a suitable residence for the Buddha and his disciples, the only place that seemed to him sufficiently spacious and serene was the forested preserve of Crown Prince Jeta, two kilometers southwest of the city. When Sudatta inquired about buying it, the prince joked, "I'll sell you whatever portion you can cover with gold." Taking the prince at his word, Sudatta went home and brought back enough gold to cover an area of two hundred acres that became known as Anathapindada Garden. Overcome by Sudatta's sincerity, the prince donated the entire forest to the Buddha's congregation, and together the two men built a [vihara]{.italic}, or monastery, where the Buddha could live and preach whenever he visited. These events are said to have occurred in the fourth year of the Buddha's ministry, or in 428 B.C. Altogether, the Buddha spent twenty-five rainy seasons at Jeta Vihara and delivered many of his most important sermons there. He also performed a series of miracles in Shravasti that were unique in his career, and it was also in Shravasti that he refuted the teachings of the leaders of other spiritual sects.]{.calibre7}

[Although it remains in the background, the Buddha's retreat represents the outcome of charity and forbearance, the two perfections, which, together with the perfection of wisdom, are extolled in this sutra as leading to buddhahood. The word [anatha]{.italic} means "without reliance," and [pinda-dada]{.italic} means "to give offerings." Normally, this compound is interpreted, as above, to mean "benefactor" or "to give offerings to those without means." But it can also mean "to give offerings without attachment," which is the practice praised throughout this sutra. Thus, the place where this sutra was spoken is more than an example of its teaching. It is the teaching.]{.calibre7}

[[1250:]{.italic} The number of bhikshus was made up primarily of the three Kashyapa brothers and their disciples, who totaled 1,000 members. Hence, it was quite natural for the elder of the three, Uruvilva, or Maha Kashyapa, to assume leadership of the First Council after the Buddha's Nirvana. In addition, the assembly also included Shariputra, Maudgalyayana, Yashas, and their disciples. Thus, by converting these six men, the Buddha attracted a group of 1250 disciples who were present at many of his sermons and who were known collectively as the [mahata bhikshu-samgha]{.italic} (full assembly of monks). Commentators suggest the reason the Buddha's first five disciples were not included in this number is that the figure was rounded off.]{.calibre7}

[[Bhikshu:]{.italic} Although this Sanskrit term means "one who begs" (for instruction from buddhas and for food from others), it also means "one who eliminates evil." In this form, it applies only to monks. The term for nuns is [bhikshuni]{.italic}. Although monks alone are mentioned at the beginning of this sutra, nuns, as well as laymen and laywomen, are listed among those present at the end of the sutra, and nuns are also present at other assemblies that make up the [Maha Prajnaparamita Sutra]{.italic}. Hence, their omission here is curious and perhaps was intended to present the monks in isolation and in contrast to the noble sons and daughters who are seen outdoing them in the practice of this teaching.]{.calibre7}

[[Bodhisattva:]{.italic} Depending on the interpretation one gives [sattva]{.italic}, this term means "spiritual warrior" (see Hardayal, [The Bodhisattva Doctrine in Buddhist Sanskrit Literature]{.italic}, p. 9) or "spiritual being," which is the more common, if less interesting, interpretation. The term originally referred to ascetics of various religious traditions but was eventually taken over by Buddhists and was extended not only to monks but to nuns as well as to male and female householders who devoted themselves to achieving enlightenment for others as well as for themselves. Thus, the term was used to represent the Mahayana ideal with its emphasis on compassion and wisdom as opposed to the Hinayana ideal of the [arhan]{.italic} with its emphasis on morality and meditation.]{.calibre7}

[Throughout this sutra, [bodhisattva]{.italic} is modified by [mahasattva]{.italic}, which I have translated as "fearless." Normally, [mahasattva]{.italic} is interpreted quite literally as "great being," as Purna does in the [Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines]{.italic}, when he says to the Buddha, "One who is called a [mahasattva]{.italic} puts on the great armor, sets forth on the great path, and rides the great vehicle. Such a being is called a [mahasattva]{.italic}." (1) However, this term was first applied not to humans but to lions and only later to those who had the courage of the king of beasts. Hence, it was used to suggest the difficulties facing those who set forth on the bodhisattva path as well as to praise them for such aspiration. Also, without fearlessness, no progress on this path is possible.]{.calibre7}

[[Textual note:]{.italic} Among Chinese editions, the presence of the Sanskrit [sanbahulais ca bodhisattvais mahasattvais]{.italic} (and a great number of fearless bodhisattvas) is reflected only in the translation of Yi-ching. A number of commentators suggest this was added to our extant Sanskrit editions (as well as to the one that formed the basis of Yi-ching's translation) by followers of the Mahayana. However, in Chapter Two Subhuti says that fearless bodhisattvas are blessed by the Buddha's daily example. Hence, bodhisattvas must be in the audience. At the end of the sutra, they also appear in the translations of Bodhiruci and Yi-ching, while laymen and laywomen are present in Chapter Thirty-two in all Chinese translations. Also, since "fearless bodhisattvas" and "noble sons and daughters" are referred to interchangeably throughout this sutra, their omission here must be either a reflection of the standard sutra opening or a device to focus attention on the monastics, who have become attached to the Hinayana ideal of the passionless arhan and indifferent to the welfare of others.]{.calibre7}

[[Before noon:]{.italic} Dawn is when gods eat; noon is when buddhas eat; dusk is when animals eat; and midnight is when spirits eat. Thus, it was the Buddha's custom to eat his one daily meal at midday, after which he ate nothing until the following day. Although this custom is still followed by the Buddhists of South and Southeast Asia, it has been relaxed, if not ignored, by those in colder climates. Seng-chao comments, "When food is cooked, this is when everyone has something and when thoughts of giving easily arise." Thus, monks begged for food when householders were preparing their midday meal.]{.calibre7}

[[Patched robe:]{.italic} The Buddha designated three robes for monks: one of five patches for daily activities, for sitting and for sleeping; one of seven patches worn on top of the one of five patches for preaching the Dharma; and one of nine (sometimes twenty-five) patches for going about in public or entering a private residence. Here, this last kind of robe, called a [civara]{.italic}, is meant. Thus, when the Buddha later takes this robe off and puts it away, he is still wearing his other garments. These two simpler robes were usually made of plain, undyed cloth, while the [civara]{.italic} was invariably saffron-yellow---thus it was also called a [kashaya]{.italic} (saffron-yellow). The sight that finally prompted Shakyamuni to leave home was that of an ascetic wearing such a robe. Also, the night of his flight from the palace, he is said to have met a hunter trying to deceive deer by wearing a similar robe, for which Shakyamuni gladly exchanged his princely garments.]{.calibre7}

[[Bowl:]{.italic} The bowl, or [patra]{.italic}, was called "the vessel of humility," and the [Vinaya]{.italic}, or rules of the Buddhist order, established limits as to its size, material, and color. In the Buddha's day, most bowls were made of iron in order to withstand being banged about during the constant wandering of the monks. However, bowls of clay and stone were also used, and the Buddha's own bowl was made of purple stone. It was said to have been the bowl used by Vipashyin, the first buddha of the present [kalpa]{.italic}, and was given to Shakyamuni by the Guardians of the Four Quarters following his Enlightenment.]{.calibre7}

[[Offerings:]{.italic} The Sanskrit term used here for "offering" is [pinda]{.italic}, which refers to any lump, but especially a lump of food. In ancient India, the main staple was glutinous rice, which was eaten with the hands by forming it into balls. The term [pinda]{.italic} occurs again at the end of the sutra in Chapter Thirty, where it includes the biggest of all lumps: a universe of a billion worlds. This is not accidental, for the practice of charity and the concept of an entity, either compounded of smaller entities or compounding a greater entity, run throughout this sutra. In the chapters that follow, the Buddha takes us through a series of synonyms for the entities of reality and compares the results of offering such things as a ball of rice, a universe of jewels, numberless existences, or a four-line poem.]{.calibre7}

[[Begging for food in the city:]{.italic} It was the Buddha's custom to go from one door to the next and not to visit more than seven households on any given day. Nor did he pass up the doors of the poor and lowly in order to receive food from the wealthy and noble. For the Buddha's compassion was even-handed and free from bias. In his final [Testament Sutra]{.italic}, the Buddha said, "You monks should cultivate with diligence. Renounce fashion and beauty, put on the faded robe, take up the vessel of humility, and support yourselves by begging. And when you do so, should feelings of pride arise, get rid of them at once. To become inflated by pride is unfitting for white-robed worldly people. How much more so for those who have left home and set forth on the Path. For the sake of liberation, humble yourselves and practice begging."]{.calibre7}

[Chiang Wei-nung says, "The purpose of begging is to conquer egotism and arrogance, to overcome attachment to flavor and taste, to concentrate the mind on cultivating the Way, and to cause others to be embarrassed.

And to put an end to their delusions, he must practice austerities so that those who see him think to themselves, 'Here is someone who takes on hardships to liberate others. How can I continue indulging in food and comfort?' And as thoughts of the Way increase, worldly thoughts decrease. Thus does begging greatly benefit others."]{.calibre7}

[[In the afternoon:]{.italic} The text is ambiguous here. The Sanskrit [pashcad bhakta-pinda-pata]{.italic}, literally means "after eating food." However, since this is already expressed in the previous phrase by [krta-bhakta-krtyas]{.italic} (eating his meal of rice), this second expression, according to Edgerton, simply indicates time and was often used as a stock term to indicate the period after the noon meal. Whereas both Conze and Müller agree with this interpretation of the text, all Chinese translations, except that of Dharmagupta, have the Buddha eating his meal after he returns, which remains the practice called for in the [Vinaya]{.italic} for monks and nuns. However, as the Buddha's reputation grew, he and his disciples were often invited to take their noon meal in the homes of wealthy householders, and perhaps this was such an occasion.]{.calibre7}

[[Sat down on the appointed seat:]{.italic} There is some difference of opinion concerning the Buddha's seat.

But [prajnapta]{.italic} is not used as a verb here but as an adjective modifying [asane]{.italic} ([seat]{.italic}). Still, it is unclear whether the Buddha did the arranging or simply sat down on a seat that had been arranged for him. I have decided in favor of the latter and translated [prajnapta]{.italic} as "appointed." Conze has "arranged for him," while Müller has "intended for him." Also, according to the [Perfection of Wisdom in Seven Hundred Lines]{.italic}, the seat on which the Buddha delivered his discourses was just outside his cell or dwelling.]{.calibre7}

[[Turned his awareness to what was before him:]{.italic} Elsewhere in the [Maha Prajnaparamita Sutra]{.italic}, the Buddha begins his discourses after entering what is called the King of Samadhis, or Deepest of Trances. Here, in keeping with the tenor of this more down-to-earth discourse, the Buddha simply practices mindfulness. Normally four subjects of mindfulness are distinguished as an essential part of meditation. The first of these is [kaya-smirti-upasthana]{.italic} (mindfulness of the body). The others are mindfulness regarding [vedana]{.italic} (sensations), [citta]{.italic} (thoughts), and [dharma]{.italic} (dharmas). All of these are dealt with in the chapters that follow, but here the text specifies [pratimukhim-smirtim-upasthapya]{.italic}, where [pratimukhi]{.italic} simply refers to whatever is present, whatever one is facing. Since the primary subject of this sutra is the nature of the buddha's body, this can be viewed as the beginning of a meditation on the body of reality, which is the Buddha's true body, his dharma body.

Eating his meal, returning to his abode, putting away his robe and bowl, and washing his feet, he practices the perfection of vigor.

[MOST BUDDHIST SUTRAS begin with a question. Subhuti has just witnessed the compassion and detachment with which the Buddha performed his daily round of giving and receiving offerings, and he is moved to ask how others might do the same. Among the Buddha's disciples, Subhuti was foremost in his freedom from passion, for he was the one who best understood the doctrine of emptiness. On this occasion, he saw in the Buddha's actions the perfect realization of that doctrine. Thus, he expresses his gratitude for such instruction by example and asks how others, not only monks but anyone who seeks to live an enlightened life, can follow in the Buddha's footsteps. The wording of his questions, however, reflects the understanding of someone on the Hinayana, or Lesser Path. But this is a Mahayana sutra.]{.calibre7}

[Depending on how the word [subhuti]{.italic} is parsed, it can mean "born of emptiness" or "auspicious sight." Although Subhuti's family possessed great wealth, on the day he was born all the gold and silver in his family's storeroom disappeared. Thus, he was born of emptiness. Then, seven days later, his family's gold and silver reappeared. Thus, his birth was also an auspicious sight. Looking back on this event, commentators muse that the disappearance of his family's wealth demonstrated the truth of emptiness, while its reappearance demonstrated that true emptiness is empty of emptiness.]{.calibre7}

[Subhuti was born in the city of Shravasti and became one of the Buddha's ten most prominent disciples. As his name foretold, he was known for his understanding of the doctrine of emptiness. Thus, it was appropriate that he assumed the role of interlocutor for the assembly on this occasion. He was, however, quite elderly and was not always present when the Buddha spoke. According to a later tradition recorded in Hsuan-tsang's [Hsiyuchi]{.italic} (Buddhist Records of the Western World), Subhuti was the Blue Dragon Buddha of the East and joined the Buddha's assembly in this form to assist in instructing others about prajna.]{.calibre7}

[Chiang Wei-nung says, "When the Buddha sat down, the whole assembly followed suit. Hence, Subhuti rose from his seat. The robe was normally worn over both shoulders, except when it was necessary to demonstrate reverence or respect. To bare one's shoulder shows that one is prepared to carry something, in this case the Buddha's teaching concerning prajna. When people act, they normally use their right hand. And when they walk, they usually lead with their right foot. Here, these gestures indicate that there is some matter about which a disciple wishes to ask. Also, the palms are pressed together to indicate that they hold nothing else. Together, these physical gestures indicate that the body is pure, while the reverence they express indicates that the mind is pure. Finally, Subhuti speaks and thereby indicates that his mouth is pure. These three: body, mind, and mouth are the three sources of karma. Up to this point, the words are those of Ananda \[or Vashpa?\], the compiler of this sutra."]{.calibre7}

[Also, no blessing could be greater than a buddha's example. And no trust could be greater than to follow such an example. The blessing and trust that Subhuti has perceived is the Buddha's practice of the three perfections: the perfection of forbearance, in begging for his living; the perfection of charity, in teaching others through example; and the perfection of wisdom, in remaining mindful in all he does. Together, these perfections make up the offering of buddhahood, which the Buddha bestows on all those present as a blessing and as a trust. Subhuti also perceives that the Buddha's blessing and trust extend beyond his fellow bhikshus to the larger audience of bodhisattvas. Though he represents the pinnacle of Hinayana practice, Subhuti realizes that this is a Mahayana assembly.]{.calibre7}

[Chiang Wei-nung says, "Subhuti sighs in admiration that such a rare occasion arises from everyday actions. The Buddha is not attached to the appearance of buddhahood but manifests a buddha's lack of self. The purpose of this entire sutra is to break through the self, which the Buddha does without saying a word and which Subhuti perceives. [Bhagavan]{.italic} is a general expression used as a form of address. To call a person a buddha, or enlightened one, is to indicate his attainment. To call him a tathagata, or one who appears as he truly is, is to indicate his nature. As the Buddha put on his robe and ate his meal and so forth, Subhuti was able to see his appearance as no appearance. Thus, he called him 'Tathagata.' And why did the Buddha appear as a human being? Because he cherished others and did not abandon them. This is great compassion. But by letting his dharma body appear as a human being, he also demonstrated lack of attachment to form, which is the essence of the [Diamond Sutra]{.italic}. Thus, he instructed others without words. And while wordless instruction represents the greatest wisdom, it arises from great compassion."]{.calibre7}

Hence, Subhuti's words of praise are not meant to be superficial, for they arise from realization. In fact, the whole sutra can be summed up by these words."]{.calibre7}

[The blessing and trust of the Buddha's example are not enough. Hence, Subhuti begins with [tat]{.italic} (even so), as he inquires further into the basis of buddhahood. Although Subhuti understands the doctrine of emptiness expressed in the Buddha's everyday actions, he senses there is something more to buddhahood than emptiness and asks for instruction in this matter on his own behalf, as well as that of others. The noble sons and daughters on whose behalf he asks include those who acknowledge the Buddha's teaching, regardless of whether they have left home as monks and nuns or are lay bodhisattvas. The Sanskrit here is [kula]{.italic}, which means "of noble family." To be born into a noble family is the result of karma. Likewise, to encounter the Buddha's teaching and to possess the capacity to understand it are also made possible by one's karma. If, however, someone should hear this teaching and not practice it, such a person would waste an opportunity that might not come again for many lifetimes.]{.calibre7}

[The path Subhuti asks about is the path of the bodhisattva, and not that of the arhan, the Mahayana path, and not the Hinayana path. Although those who emphasize "other power" prefer to interpret [yana]{.italic} as "vehicle," as in the "Great Vehicle," the word's original meaning was "path." It was not the Buddha's custom nor that of his disciples to ride when they could walk. For the path is the destination. Subhuti has just seen the Buddha stand and walk on this path. Hence, he now asks how he and others can do so.]{.calibre7}

[As for those who set forth on this path, the [Maha Prajnaparamita Sutra]{.italic} says a bodhisattva is "anyone who ceaselessly seeks unexcelled, perfect enlightenment as well as the happiness and welfare of all beings."

The importance of this will become clearer in the next chapter.]{.calibre7}

[Chiang Wei-nung says, "In Buddhist sutras, it is sometimes said that women experience such great distractions that they cannot become buddhas but must first be reborn as men. The Dharma, however, is shared by all. If women first had to be reborn as men, this would be less than all. Still, the distractions of women are great. First is the distraction of motherhood. Second, they frequently confuse love for compassion. Compassion is impartial. It knows neither direction nor degree. Love, meanwhile, is a river of life and death, of endless rebirth. In the eyes of the Buddha there is neither male nor female. The reason he says the distractions of women are greater is because they need to take greater care. Yet, if they can make the great resolve to set forth on such a path, they, too, will become buddhas. This is why Subhuti asks on behalf of both men and women."]{.calibre7}

[Subhuti's questions were prompted by seeing the Buddha going about his daily round, standing and walking in the city, returning and sitting down and meditating on what was before him. And they reflect his desire to learn how he and others might conduct themselves in the same manner. But they also betray the concerns of a follower of the Lesser Path. Subhuti seeks the way to restrict karma-producing actions and thoughts rather than the way to transform them. Sometime later in his career, after he has realized the teaching of this sutra, he tells his fellow disciple Shariputra, "Thus should bodhisattvas stand and walk: they should resolve that 'as the Tathagata does not stand anywhere and does not not stand anywhere and does not stand apart and does not not stand apart, so will I stand. And as the Tathagata stands, so will I stand and walk, my feet well placed without a place to stand.' Thus should bodhisattvas stand and walk. When they walk in this manner, they conform with the perfection of wisdom." ([Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines]{.italic}: 2) Such actions as standing and walking were as much as Subhuti saw of the Buddha's practice of wisdom. He could not see how the Buddha controlled his mind. And yet how the Buddha stood and walked was a function of his mind. Hence, Subhuti asked how to control his mind in the same way.]{.calibre7}

And in order to liberate countless beings and save them from further rebirth, they do not stand in nirvana. Such persons are bodhisattvas who thus embark on the bodhisattva path.'

[THIS THEN IS WHAT BODHISATTVAS DO, which is also what buddhas do. They give the gift of liberation, which some accept, while others don't. Their resolution, however, is to liberate all beings. Hence, bodhisattvas are patient in this practice, which is not limited by time or space or by perceptions of the mind. Here, the Buddha summarizes how bodhisattvas stand, walk, and control their thoughts, which they do by giving birth to a thought so completely altruistic it includes neither self nor other. Subhuti expected something different. Although he asked on behalf of those who would travel the bodhisattva path, his questions were those we might expect of a shravaka of the Lesser Path interested in moral discipline and meditation. But instead of telling us how to conduct our lives and our practice or how to control our thoughts, the Buddha tells us to give birth to a thought. The Buddha's approach is homeopathic. He uses a thought to put an end to all thoughts. But to effect such a cure not just any thought will do. Only a thought directed towards the liberation of all beings will work. Thus, bodhisattvas turn their thoughts into offerings.]{.calibre7}

[The bodhisattva path is the path of active, rather than passive, practice. Rather than advising us to suppress our thoughts, the Buddha preempts them. He advises bodhisattvas not to wait for thoughts to arise but to give birth to a thought that puts all other thoughts to flight, a thought like the morning sun that chases the myriad stars from the sky. The language used here suggests that this thought has been gestating within us for many lifetimes and it is now time to bring it forth, to give it life. Thus, this is the most important event in a bodhisattva's career and what makes a bodhisattva a bodhisattva.]{.calibre7}

[The bodhisattva's journey does not end until all beings are liberated. But if this is to work, the category [sattva]{.italic} (being) must be expanded to include all beings. The Buddha realizes that those who would travel the bodhisattva path have no way of knowing the full range of beings they have vowed to liberate. Hence, he lists the following categories to provide some useful parameters for such great resolve. These categories, however, are merely provisional and not meant to establish any real differences among the beings they characterize. Meanwhile, no matter how great their number, no matter how diverse they might be, the [bodhi-sattva]{.italic} (bodhi-being) resolves to liberate them all.]{.calibre7}

[In categorizing the myriad beings that result from ignorance and the operation of karma, the Buddha (and he was following traditional conceptions of his day) divides them according to their mode of birth as well as their possession or lack of any form or perception. In terms of birth, first are those who come from eggs. These range from great winged birds to lice. Next are those who are born from the womb. These include creatures as big as elephants and as small as mice. Next are those who are born from the water. These range from fishes and turtles to the tiniest pond creatures. And last are those who are born from the air. Ting Fu-pao says, "Those who are born from the air depend on nothing. The only thing they require for their birth is the force of karma. They include the devas of the various heavens and the sinners of the myriad hells as well as the beings at the beginning of every kalpa." To this category also belong bodhisattvas.]{.calibre7}
:::

:::

::: calibre13
[Not only do these four means of birth remind us how life begins, they also remind us how ignorance and delusion begin, and they can also be seen as having a special relationship with the four perceptions mentioned at the end of this chapter. Viewed from this perspective, our self is born from an egg, our being from a womb, our life from water, and our soul from air. The four modes of birth are also related to the four stages of liberation discussed in Chapter Nine, which begin with the srota-apanna, who breaks out of the egg of the ego, and end with the arhan, whose soul is no longer subject to rebirth. Tsung-mi says, "The beginning of life is called birth. When it first begins, it is by one of these four means. But it is ignorance that is reborn. Thus, the [Medicine Buddha Sutra]{.italic} says, 'Break through the shell of ignorance.'"]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
[There is some difference of opinion among commentators as to the relationship of these four modes of birth to the categories of form and perception that follow. Some commentators think that all nine categories represent a single sequence in what Buddhists call the Three Realms, with the first four categories of birth belonging to the Realm of Desire and the two categories of form and the three categories of perception representing a progressive ascension through the meditative states of the realms of Form and Formlessness. Chiang Wei-nung, for example, says, "When Buddhist sutras divide beings into the Six States of Existence, it is to show their position on the wheel of rebirth. When they divide beings into the Three Realms, it is to show their position on the hierarchy of attainment as well as their dependence on desire and form. Here the Three Realms are not mentioned per se but are meant. And the Realm of Formlessness is given prominence because of its special characteristics."]{.calibre7}
:::

::: calibre4
 
:::

::: calibre13
[However, such an interpretation fails to mention or explain that while the first three modes of birth occur in the Realm of Desire, the fourth mode of birth includes beings in the Realm of Formlessness, such as certain devas and bodhisattvas. Hence, a hierarchy cannot be what the Buddha had in mind here. A simpler and more sensible reading is to see the Buddha's presentation as three separate, all-inclusive schemes for the characterization of beings. Thus, beings can be distinguished not only as to their mode of birth but also as to whether or not they possess any [rupa]{.italic} (form) or [sanjna]{.italic} (perception). The Buddha, I suggest, was simply creating a definition that would be all-inclusive from any of these three perspectives. All beings are born in one of these four manners, all beings either have a bodily form or do not have a bodily form, and all beings perceive an external world or do not perceive an external world or neither perceive nor do not perceive an external world. The last two categories, of which we admittedly have little or no knowledge, were the subjects of discussions in the Buddha's day and were added here to suggest the size of the Sea of Being in which the bodhisattva swims.]{.calibre7}

[[Textual note:]{.italic} My choice of "air" for the Sanskrit [upapaduka]{.italic} (to depend on nothing) is meant to describe the appearance of such birth as if from "thin air."

However, "transformation" is somewhat misleading, as the term does not apply to butterflies or cicadas but to such beings in the Formless Realm as devas, sinners, the first creatures of any universe, and certain bodhisattvas. "Miraculously" would also be a mistake as it suggests creation beyond the laws of karma, which, again, is not the case. The only Buddhist scholar I know of to offer a solution to this confusion is Garma Chang, who uses "ethereally" in his translation of the sutras that make up the [Maha Ratnakuta]{.italic}.]{.calibre7}

[The term [nirvana]{.italic} originally referred to an extinguished fire. In Buddhism, it is used to describe the condition that exists when the Three Fires of delusion, desire, and anger are extinguished. This is also called "incomplete nirvana," because a being who achieves this state still has a body and is still subject to the laws of karma, and thus suffering. When the Buddha attained Enlightenment under the pippala ([Ficus religiosa]{.italic}) tree at Bodhgaya, he achieved incomplete nirvana. When he expired between the twin shala trees ([Shorea robusta]{.italic}) and his body was cremated at Kushinagara, he achieved complete nirvana. Thus, complete nirvana rises from the ashes of being.

[The Buddha tells Subhuti that the bodhisattva's practice only succeeds if it is devoted to the liberation of all beings and at the same time detached from the perception of being. Like fish in the ocean, bodhi-sattvas swim in the sattva sea. Free of the perception of being, bodhi-beings free all beings. Thus, we have been liberated countless times. The [Vimalakirti Sutra]{.italic} says, "All beings have already been liberated. They do not need to be liberated again." (4) Every time someone is enlightened, we are all liberated again. And yet we continue to drown in the sea of being. Meanwhile, the enlightened-beings who liberate us are not only free of the perception of being, they are also free of the perception of self. Not only is no one liberated, no one liberates. Moreover, there is no liberation. For bodhisattvas are also free of the perceptions of life and rebirth around which liberation turns.

[IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER, the Buddha told Subhuti that bodhisattvas give birth to the thought of liberating others but without creating the perception of a self, a being, a life, or a soul. What they give birth to is the gift of liberation. But it is only liberation if it is given without attachment, without attachment to any object of the senses, including the mind. The previous chapter focused on the giver and the recipient. This chapter focuses on the gift. The Buddha also anticipates our doubts about what merit can possibly result from such practice. For it is only by means of merit that spiritual progress is possible. This is the law of karma, which also applies to bodhisattvas. Every fruit grows from a seed. But if we practice without being attached to our practice, what sort of merit can we expect? The fruit from a seed without limits turns out to be a fruit without limits, which prompts the question answered in the next chapter: what kind of fruit could possibly have no limits?]{.calibre7}

[Having stepped onto the bodhisattva path without such baggage as a self, a being, a life, or a soul, noble sons and daughters are now advised how to walk that path, which they do by practicing the perfection of charity, for the compassionate aspiration to save other beings is essentially an act of charity, and charity is the only member of the six perfections that by itself results in merit. For it is the only member directed exclusively at liberating others. Thus, it is the first step on the bodhisattva path. It is also the last step. For by liberating others, bodhisattvas liberate themselves. But liberation is only possible if there is no attachment of any kind, including attachment to the gift of liberation.]{.calibre7}

[In the practice of charity, Buddhists distinguish three kinds of gifts: material, emotional, and spiritual. Material gifts include such things as food and clothes and medicine. Emotional gifts include comfort and protection. And spiritual gifts include guidance and instruction. In terms of their benefits, material gifts put an end to greed; emotional gifts put an end to anger; and spiritual gifts put an end to delusion. It was the combination of all three in the Buddha's daily life that prompted Subhuti's questions and resulted in these further instructions on the nature of the practice that results in buddhahood.]{.calibre7}

[In practicing charity, or any of the perfections, the Buddha warns against attachment to three things: the practitioner (in this case, the person who gives); the beneficiary (the recipient); and the practice (the giving of the gift). In his "Outline of Practice," Bodhidharma says, "Since what is real includes nothing worth begrudging, we give our bodies, our lives, and our property in charity, without regret, without the vanity of giver, gift, or recipient, and without bias or attachment. To get rid of obstructions, we teach others, but without becoming attached to appearances. Thus, while we ourselves practice, we are able to help others as well as to glorify the Path to Enlightenment. And as with charity, so do we also practice the other five paramitas. But while practicing the six paramitas to eliminate delusion, we practice nothing at all. This is what is meant by practicing the Dharma."

He also says that Asanga's [eka-dyaya-trayeneha]{.italic} (one, two, three, respectively) refers to all six perfections, with the giving of material goods representing the [one]{.italic} practice of charity, the giving of protection representing the [two]{.italic} practices of morality and forbearance, and the giving of the truth representing the [three]{.italic} practices of vigor (which results in acquisition of special powers), meditation, and wisdom.

The Buddha teaches us to practice charity, to rid ourselves of all attachments within, and to benefit all beings without. By not dwelling on anything, bodhisattvas do not see the self that gives, nor do they see the other that receives, nor do they see anything given. For all three are essentially empty. By concentrating without concentrating on anything, their practice of charity remains pure. They do not desire what they do not have. Nor do they long for some future reward. When ordinary people practice charity, they hope for some blessing or benefit. This is to practice charity while attached to something."]{.calibre7}

[Chiang Wei-nung says, "By 'thing' is meant the objects of our six senses, including what is seen or heard or perceived as well as what is not seen, not heard, not perceived. Charity is but one of the six [paramitas]{.italic}, or perfections. The [Maha Prajnaparamita Shastra]{.italic} discusses all six. This sutra only mentions charity to avoid being verbose and for the sake of simplicity. Charity here represents all other dharmas, all of which must be practiced without attachment. In the previous section, the Buddha mentions the bodhisattva's resolution; here he mentions the bodhisattva's practice. Resolution and practice cannot be separated from one another, nor does one precede the other. Also, previously the Buddha says that bodhisattvas save limitless beings, but he does not say how they save them. Here he tells us how. All the Buddha's teachings can be summarized by the word "renunciation." But renunciation is another word for charity. By renouncing attachment to a self, we become arhans. By renouncing attachment to dharmas, we become bodhisattvas. By renouncing renouncing, we become buddhas. Thus, charity is the ultimate practice."]{.calibre7}

But because they constitute our perception of reality, dharmas also refer to certain teachings and practices. Thus, dharmas are "truths."

[Objects are manifestations, mirages, or signs of things that never quite appear in their entirety, because none of them is ultimately real but only perceived to be real. When we perceive a person or a thing, we perceive something that exists in space and time as a combination of visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and cognitive elements. But upon closer analysis, each of these elements turns out to be constantly changing and impossible to isolate from other elements. Thus, nothing is real. Still, we can't let go of the larger, supposedly unchanging entity that we imagine exists somewhere beyond the horizon of our sensory faculties. And yet such an entity never quite appears. But the reason that it never quite appears is because it is an illusion whose reality we extrapolate by combining elements that are themselves no more real than the illusion to which they contribute. Thus, a perception of an object is a delusion of an illusion. For if the object itself is not real, how can the perception of it be real? On the other hand, if we can keep from becoming attached to the perception, we cannot be obstructed or restricted by the object.]{.calibre7}

Thus, Vasubandu comments, "What follows explains the benefits of charity, for the Buddha tells us the merit from such practice is great. But why did the Buddha not extol merit after telling us how to stand and walk and only mention it after telling us how to control our thoughts? He does so because only if people are detached from perceptions of objects can they practice charity without attachment."]{.calibre7}

[The term the Buddha uses to express this is [punya-skandha]{.italic}. The word [punya]{.italic} includes such meanings as "pure," "holy," "auspicious," and "meritorious." It is this last meaning that Buddhists usually associate with the word, and it certainly has that sense here, since it refers to the karmic results of the practice of charity, which is the only practice that by itself results in merit. But merit refers to more than what we normally think of as "good karma." It refers to karma that is in some sense selfless and thus no karma. It is not simply good karma but the bodhi seed from which the tree of enlightenment grows.]{.calibre7}

[[Skandha]{.italic} also has a long history of usage and a number of meanings. Most translators render it by "aggregate," "heap," or "store." This is how it is usually translated when it refers to the five skandhas of form, sensation, perception, volition, and cognition in which we search for a self in vain. But such renderings hardly do [skandha]{.italic} justice. The primary meaning of [skandha]{.italic} is not a "pile" but a "body minus its appendages." The word is derived from the root [skand]{.italic}, meaning "to ejaculate (semen)," and it originally referred to such things as a tree trunk or a human torso. This, for example, is how the Jains used the word, which, ironically, they used interchangeably with a word we encountered in the first chapter, [pinda]{.italic} (ball of rice/offering/entity). Thus, it would be more appropriate to call these skandhas "bodies," as we do when we speak of an artist's "body of work." Their unity is not an accidental agglomeration of disparate stuff. Nor do they only exist in some future bank account but right now. They are more like the overlays in a biology textbook, overlays to which we give coherence by our own set of perceptions, delusions though they may be. Thus, the term [punya-skandha]{.italic} means "body of merit" and not "heap of merit" or "store of merit." The importance and appropriateness of this interpretation will become clearer in the chapters that follow.]{.calibre7}

[Without sufficient merit, liberation is not possible. There is no such thing as spontaneous buddhahood. It is our merit that results in a good birth in a good family in a good place during a good time under the guidance of a good teacher. However, if merit can be compared to a seed and liberation to its fruit, the only seed capable of producing a fruit that has no limits is a seed that has no limits. Hence, as this sutra progresses, the Buddha expands our understanding of the merit that accrues to those who cultivate this teaching until it exceeds all possible conceptions, including those of space and time. Thus, this body of merit is not equivalent to good karma. It is selfless and hence transforms the constraints of karma into the path to buddhahood. Very few things are not subject to karma. Space is one, which is why the Buddha uses it here as a metaphor. But space is not the only thing that is not subject to karma. Nirvana, which was mentioned in the previous chapter as the realm in which all beings are liberated, is another. A third is a buddha's true body, the body of reality, about which we will learn more in the next chapter, and with which the bodhisattva's body of merit is inextricably linked.]{.calibre7}

[IN THE PREVIOUS TWO CHAPTERS, the Buddha told Subhuti that in order to liberate others, bodhisattvas must do so without being attached to perceptions of a self, a being, or liberation and that as a result of such practice bodhisattvas produce and obtain a body of merit that has no conceivable limits. In this chapter, the Buddha tells us what he means by a body that has no limits and what our attitude toward such a body should be. For the Buddha is concerned that bodhisattvas will become attached to the immeasurable body they acquire as a result of their practice. In his [Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]{.italic}, Ashvaghosha says "What is perceived by bodhisattvas from their first aspiration to the end of the bodhisattva path is the sanbhoga-kaya, or reward body. This body has countless forms, its forms have countless attributes, its attributes have countless excellent qualities, and the place where it appears has countless adornments. It appears without bounds, inexhaustible and indivisible. And as it responds, it is never lost or destroyed. Such merits as these all result from the influence of the spotless practice of the perfections." (cf. Hakeda, p. 69-70; Suzuki, p.101)]{.calibre7}

[This teaching is so important, that the same question is put to Subhuti in Chapter Twenty and again in Chapter Twenty-six and yet again in Chapter Twenty-seven. And each time it is meant to further develop our understanding of the bodhisattva's practice as well as the nature of buddhahood and a buddha's body. This is not an idle exercise in semantics but is crucial to understanding the nature of what the Buddha acquired as a result of his own practice as a bodhisattva as well as the nature of what he teaches and the nature of our own practice and our own body. A number of commentators have therefore suggested that this chapter marks the conclusion of the central teaching of the sutra and that the remaining chapters simply develop what is stated in these first five.]{.calibre7}

[Every object of our senses is known to us by a set of attributes. In fact, every object of our senses is nothing more than a set of attributes, which we arbitrarily combine, usually for selfish reasons, and whose own individual existence we accept unquestioned. Thus, this body of ours is known to us by the attributes our senses weave around that seed of ignorance we call a self, that grain of sand that becomes the pearl we refuse to relinquish. And we regard this body of ours not only as having an independent physical existence, but also as having an independent psychic or spiritual existence as well. Buddhas, too, have physical and spiritual bodies. And the Buddha asks Subhuti if the Tathagata can be identified by such a body or by the attributes that comprise such a body.]{.calibre7}

[The Buddha's physical body was said to include a set of thirty-two attributes that included a protuberance on top of his head, a curl between his brows, long earlobes, blue eyes, skin the color of burnished gold, arms that hung down to his knees, flat feet, a retractable penis---thirty-two attributes in all---each of which was acquired as the result of one hundred acts of merit performed over the course of three infinitely long kalpas. Thus, the Buddha's physical body was seen as the tangible fruit of a bodhisattva's practice. Early Buddhists assumed that this was how other buddhas looked as well. And they called such an appearance the Buddha's [nirmana-kaya]{.italic}, his incarnated or apparition body, in which he appeared in order to teach the beings of this world. Such a concept also allowed the Buddha's followers to explain the apparent decay and death of his biological body. The body they cremated was an incarnation or apparition, not his true body.]{.calibre7}

[In addition to his incarnated physical body, every buddha is also said to have a spiritual body that only exists in the Formless Realm beyond the realms of Desire and Form and of which only he and other buddhas are aware. This is the [sanbhoga-kaya]{.italic}, his reward body or enraptured body. It, too, is acquired as a result of a bodhisattva's practice and acquisition of merit. In fact, it is acquired the moment a bodhisattva sets forth on the bodhisattva path. But it is not fully realized until a bodhisattva approaches the end of that path. This is what the Buddha referred to in the previous chapter as a bodhisattva's "body of merit." But because both of these bodies are the result of causes and conditions, neither of them is ultimately real. Neither survives the fires of nirvana, and neither of these is what the Buddha has in mind here. The Buddha wants Subhuti to see his true body, his [dharma-kaya]{.italic}. The Buddha knows Subhuti understands that his physical body is not real, but he wants Subhuti to understand that neither is his reward body real.

[In Subhuti's answer, we see the beginning but not the conclusion of the dialectic developed by the Buddha to convey the concept of [shunyata]{.italic} (emptiness). To see that an entity is no entity is not enough. At this point, Subhuti presents the Hinayana view of emptiness, not the Mahayana view, which sees emptiness as also empty. Thus, the Buddha adds to Subhuti's response in order to complete the dialectic for him. The Chinese Zen Master Ch'ing-yuan explained it this way: "When I first began to practice, the mountains and rivers were simply mountains and rivers. After I advanced in my practice, the mountains and rivers were no longer mountains and rivers.

[The Buddha's point is that while we can view the attributes of a body as an illusion, if we can see them as no attributes, as not severed from the seamless fabric of reality, we see the Buddha's true body, which necessarily includes the very attributes whose reality was just denied. Thus, the arhan's denial of reality becomes the bodhisattva's affirmation. This technique is used repeatedly throughout this sutra to demonstrate through logic what the word "emptiness" often fails to convey by itself. Meanwhile, Zen masters often shortened this logical technique even further by holding up one finger, by refusing to speak, by striking their disciples, or by offering them a cup of tea.]{.calibre7}

Subhuti has also heard the Buddha say that his real body, of which his apparition and reward bodies are but aspects, can be seen, though by means of attributes that are no attributes. Such a teaching is, indeed, difficult to believe and difficult to understand, and it surpasses the reach of Subhuti's own understanding. Hence, while Subhuti is concerned about how others will be able to believe such a teaching, implicit in his question is his own difficulty in grasping it.]{.calibre7}

[In presenting his doubts about the future, Subhuti introduces a concept current in ancient India as well as in ancient China: that in every world the length of lives becomes progressively shorter and the ability of beings to understand the truth becomes progressively impaired as time goes on. Commentators, however, disagree as to which period Subhuti and the Buddha are referring. Some sutras, such as the [Maha Samnipata Sutra]{.italic} (55), enumerate up to five periods in which the purity of Buddhist practice is expected to degenerate every five hundred years, going from an emphasis on liberation, to meditation, to learning, to religious works, and finally to doctrinal dissension. Since this series is said to have begun with the Buddha's Nirvana in 383 B.C., the "dharma-ending age" should end soon after the beginning of the twenty-second century. Meanwhile, other sutras say the progressive disappearance of the Dharma spans three periods, the first two of which last one thousand years apiece, and the third of which lasts ten thousand years. Hence, some commentators suggest that Subhuti is referring to the last five hundred years of this longer period. Still others contend (and this is how Kumarajiva as well as Nagarjuna understood it) that the period in question is the one immediately following the Buddha's Nirvana, which, curiously, coincided with the appearance and widespread acceptance of teachings such as this.]{.calibre7}

[Among modern commentators, Conze alone stresses the paradox of the words used here: [bhuta-sanjna]{.italic} (perception of the truth). If all perceptions are false, how can any perception be true? They can be true if they are known to be false. Once we know them for what they are, we can put them to use in crossing the Sea of Endless Rebirth and Unrelieved Suffering. Such perceptions are what the Buddha means here by "dharmas" or "buddha dharmas." Bodhisattvas are those who are able to put such perceptions to use and then put them aside. Meanwhile, other translators (both Chinese and English) consider [bhuta-sanjna]{.italic} a cliché and render both words by [hsin]{.italic} (belief).]{.calibre7}

[In the previous chapter, Subhuti does not see the real Buddha, only emptiness. Here, he does not understand the nature of the real Sangha (Buddhist order) either. Subhuti wonders how anyone in the future can fathom a teaching he himself does not fully understand, especially since beings in the future will not have the advantage of the Buddha's example and personal instruction. But the Buddha rebukes Subhuti and says there will surely be beings in the future who believe this teaching. They are called bodhisattvas. Subhuti underestimates the power of a bodhisattva's resolve rightly made. There will, indeed, be those whose faculties and abilities are complete (who know how to stand), whose moral character is pure (who know how to walk), and whose understanding is profound (who know how to control their thoughts). For once they resolve to liberate all beings, there will be no place or age when bodhisattvas do not appear. Time and space are not constraints for the bodhisattva's body of merit.

[Belief and understanding come from merit just as a fruit comes from a tree, which comes from a fruit, which comes from a tree. Belief and understanding do not fall from space but require careful cultivation of dharma seeds collected from countless buddhas over countless lifetimes. Shakyamuni, too, honored hundreds and thousands of buddhas in the course of his development as a bodhisattva. By honoring those who teach the Dharma, bodhisattvas eliminate inauspicious roots and add to their auspicious roots. The roots determine the nature and quality of the fruit. Roots include our abilities and habits of behavior, speech, and thought. Auspicious roots give birth to belief and understanding. Inauspicious roots give birth to disbelief and delusion. Thus, to believe and understand such a profound teaching as this, beings cannot plant just any seed, but a seed that puts forth the deepest of roots. And only bodhisattvas are capable of planting and cultivating such a seed. Subhuti asks about beings. The Buddha answers about bodhisattvas. Only bodhisattvas possess a body capable of bearing the weight of this teaching during the dharma-ending age. For having resolved to liberate all beings, bodhisattvas are not bound by time or space, but appear in all times and places, wherever there are beings in need of liberation. Thus, the lineage of bodhisattvas and buddhas is endless. This is the nature of their infinite body of merit.]{.calibre7}

Here, bodhisattvas are not yet capable of bearing or fully realizing the truth of such an insight, but they are capable of perceiving it.

However, beings are attached to seeking perceptions outside of themselves. But the more they seek, the more they get lost. They send a buddha to find a buddha. They use the mind to chase the mind. They can exhaust themselves for kalpas, but they'll never succeed. They don't realize that when they put an end to thoughts and reasoning, the buddha will appear before them. This mind is the buddha. The buddha is an ordinary being. When it's an ordinary being, this mind doesn't contract. When it's a buddha, it doesn't expand. When it meets conditions, it acts. When conditions end, it stops. It doesn't need to be pinned down or realized. It is already perfect. If you aren't willing to believe that this is the buddha, even if you cultivate for countless kalpas, you will never reach the Way. To cling to the perception of a dharma means that a dharma exists outside the mind. Hence, you are attached to perceptions. Whether you do evil or do good, you are attached to perceptions. When you do evil while attached to perceptions, you waste your rebirth. When you do good while attached to perceptions, you waste your hardships. Neither can compare with recognizing your own mind right now. Outside this mind, there are no dharmas. This mind is the dharma. Outside this dharma, there is no mind. You can use the mind to eliminate the mind, but the mind still exists.

We still need dharmas to help us and others reach the far shore. Thus, we offer up our self-existence and receive in exchange a body of merit. But even a body of merit is but "a lamp, a cataract, a star in space."]{.calibre7}

[This comparison of dharmas to a raft appears in many other sutras, both Pali and Sanskrit. For example, in the [Samyukt Agama]{.italic} the Buddha meets a group of monks who are arguing about who is following a true dharma and who is following a false dharma. The Buddha dismisses their arguments as fruitless and tells them the only purpose of any dharma is to help beings cross the Sea of Life and Death. Once across, what talk can there be of a right dharma or a wrong dharma? The Buddha also uses the metaphor of medicine in the same way, urging his disciples not to become addicted to a medicine that cures their illness, lest they exchange one illness for another. Thus, the Buddha urges us to let go of our perceptions of reality but also to let go of our perceptions of unreality as well. Again, he is concerned that the arhans in his audience will mistake emptiness for enlightenment and fail to understand the importance of working for the liberation of others.]{.calibre7}

[Asanga says, "Not clinging but adapting, we realize all dharmas. Like rafts we leave behind, their hidden meaning is the same." (14) Thus do bodhisattvas consider the usefulness of spiritual teachings in helping them cross the Sea of Suffering but without becoming attached to them. Vasubandhu comments, "If they lead to higher realization, we should treat dharmas as we would a raft until we reach the shore. This is their 'hidden meaning.' The same raft is used and also abandoned. Likewise, other dharmas and truths that do not lead to realization must be abandoned."]{.calibre7}

Just as before you understand the true nature of things, you need buddha dharmas. But once you're across, you don't need the raft. Just as once you understand the true nature of things, you don't need buddha dharmas. Thus, once you understand, if you should let go of buddha dharmas, how much more so what is not a buddha dharma or the teachings of other sects?"]{.calibre7}

Finally, he teaches them that emptiness is empty to keep them from clinging to emptiness. Here, however, the word 'dharma' refers not to the perception of a dharma but to the teachings of the Buddha, while 'no dharma' refers not to the absence of such a perception but to such worldly matters as wealth and fame."]{.calibre7}

[IN THE PREVIOUOS CHAPTER, the Buddha told Subhuti to let go of dharmas once they had served their purpose, but to let go of no-dharmas even sooner. The Buddha knows that Subhuti has not yet grasped this teaching, that he is still attached to the no-dharma of no-dharmas: emptiness. Hence, he raises the subject of dharmas again, this time focusing on the dharma among dharmas: unexcelled, perfect enlightenment, the realization of which is experienced by a buddha's reward body, and the teaching of which is manifested by a buddha's apparition body, but which is, itself, a buddha's true body, his dharma body.]{.calibre7}

[In his response, Subhuti applies the same logic he applies elsewhere. Enlightenment is a dharma, and all dharmas are empty. Therefore, enlightenment is empty and is thus beyond the realm of conception or expression. This is the Hinayana doctrine of emptiness. Still, Subhuti sees that there is a problem with this explanation. Hence, he adds that while such a dharma is necessarily empty, it is also necessarily not empty, for the Buddha has realized enlightenment and teaches others how to reach enlightenment. To avoid the contradiction implicit in this, Subhuti takes refuge in the "uncreated." But has Subhuti reached the land of buddhas, or has he simply changed rafts?]{.calibre7}

The Buddha told Subhuti that if bodhisattvas are attached to perceptions of space, time, or mind, they are not bodhisattvas. They liberate no one.

[This is Subhuti's answer, not the Buddha's. Subhuti is among the wisest of the Buddha's disciples, but his wisdom falls short here. What Subhuti says is true of Hinayana "sages," such as those mentioned in Chapter Nine, but it is not true of buddhas. Buddhas do not arise from the uncreated. Later, after Subhuti has grasped this teaching, he tells Shakra, "A bodhisattva does not stand on the conception that the fruits of the holy life derive from the uncreated." And when Shariputra responds, "The Tathagata stands neither on what is created nor on what is uncreated, nor does he arise therefrom," Subhuti adds, "Even so should a bodhisattva stand and walk." ([Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines:]{.italic} 2) Thus, it should be kept in mind that this sutra represents the education of Subhuti in the perfection of wisdom. He does not yet understand this teaching, nor does he understand the nature of enlightenment. But if, as Shariputra says later, buddhas arise neither from what is created nor from what is uncreated, from what then do they arise?

[The word Subhuti uses here is [asanskrita]{.italic}. In the Vedas, it usually means "unconsecrated," in contrast to [sanskrita]{.italic}, which means "consecrated," as in "consecrated by the gods." One of the Buddha's contributions to the world was to give us a religion that did not depend on the gods. It was not centered on the Laws of Manu but the Law of Karma. Thus, early Buddhists applied the term [asanskrita]{.italic} to those dharmas that are self-existent and not subject to creation or destruction. They applied this term to nirvana, to space, and to a buddha's dharma body. Subhuti reflects this understanding, as he finds no difficulty in associating enlightenment with such uncreated dharmas. But he has not yet grasped the emptiness of emptiness, which is why the sutra does not end here.

[IN THE LAST CHAPTER, Subhuti penetrated the emptiness of the Buddha's realization and teaching of enlightenment, and he traced buddhas back to the uncreated, which is the Hinayana view of a buddha's dharma body. The Buddha now brings the fully-enlightened ones back from space. The Buddha does not deny that his own realization and teaching of enlightenment have no self-nature and are not, in themselves, real. But without dharmas of some kind our progress on the path to liberation becomes impossible. In fact, liberation loses its meaning. Hence, the Buddha refuses to let Subhuti cling to the raft of emptiness and turns his disciple's attention from the uncreated back to this teaching, which is the Buddha's true (dharma) body and the source of his realization (reward body) and teaching (apparition body). Thus, while neither the realization nor the teaching of enlightenment is ultimately real, yet by such means are beings liberated.]{.calibre7}

[As in Chapter Four, the Buddha once again focuses on our [punya-skandha]{.italic}, or body of merit. This body is the projection of our selfless thoughts, words, and deeds by means of which we take part in the liberation of all beings. But if such thoughts, words, and deeds are limited, our body of merit will necessarily be limited. The Buddha wants us to trade this limited body of merit for the unlimited body produced and obtained from this teaching, which is neither created nor uncreated, neither a dharma nor no dharma, but the source of all buddha dharmas.]{.calibre7}

[Such offerings pre-date the origin of Buddhism and were considered efficacious in assuring the good fortune of donors or those in whose names they were given---hence the choice of the number "seven," which continues to be associated with good luck in cultures throughout the world. Seven is also the number of stars of the Big Dipper, whose four seasonal positions around the pivot of the sky form the ancient [sauvastika]{.italic} (with crampons pointed counterclockwise to distinguish it from the [svastika]{.italic}). Also, while the use of these precious substances not only formed an important part of devotional practice in India, once Buddhism established itself in China they became an essential part of the material culture of Chinese Buddhism as well. In fact, the gemstones in this list and their colored-glass substitutes constituted the major portion of India's exports to the China, where they were exchanged for silk and medicinal herbs. (cf. Xinru Liu, [Ancient India and Ancient China: Trade and Religious Exchanges, [A.D.]{.bold} 1-600]{.italic}, Oxford: 1988.)

[According to Buddhist cosmology, at the center of every world is a mountain called Mount Sumeru whose slopes and summit are home to the Thirty-three Heavenly Kingdoms and which is ringed by a series of seven fragrant seas and seven golden mountain ranges. Beyond the last of these ranges is a salt sea that contains the continents of Jambudvipa to the south, Purvavideha to the east, Godana to the west, and Uttarakuru to the north. And beyond these four continents and enclosing the whole world is an iron mountain range, around which move a sun and a moon. A thousand such worlds are said to make up a world system, a thousand world systems a galaxy, and a thousand galaxies a universe, which thus contains a billion worlds. Hence, the Buddha uses the most valuable objects of ancient India and the greatest imaginable unit of size. However, even a universe is subject to destruction. And even the seven jewels cannot buy liberation.]{.calibre7}

Although people possess food and clothes, if they are deluded, then during the course of their previous lives they made offerings but did not recite sutras. And if in this life they are intelligent or wise but are impoverished and short of food and clothing, then in the course of their previous lives they recited sutras and listened to the Dharma but did not make offerings. Money and wealth are treasures of the world. Prajna is the jewel of the mind. Only if people practice both internal and external cultivation will their merit be complete."]{.calibre7}

[Subhuti uses the form of dialectical argument introduced by the Buddha in Chapter Five. This technique of affirming the reality of something by first stripping it of any self-nature became the hall-mark of the Madhyamaka philosophers, such as Nagarjuna. Essentially, it is the logical equivalent of the concept of [shunyata]{.italic} (emptiness), concerning which Subhuti was supposedly so knowledgeable. The advantage of using the dialectic rather than the concept is that every concept, even the concept of emptiness, is likely to become another delusion and an obstacle to enlightenment, whereas the dialectic tends to remind those who use it of the futility of attachment to anything, including the result of its own application.]{.calibre7}

[The gatha was developed in India long before the rise of Buddhism, but it was Buddhism that introduced this poetic form to China, where it encouraged the development of the four-line chueh-chu, which formed the basis of Japanese [haiku]{.italic}. The composition of these four-line poems in China, Korea, and Japan became a favorite method among Zen masters to test their disciples, and "graduation" gathas were used to define each generation's particular style. Meanwhile, in India the gatha was used both as a stand-alone poem and to summarize prose sections of sacred and secular texts. The term was also used to refer to the shortest metrical unit of ancient Indian literature, and a number of commentators suggest its mention here does not refer to a particular verse but simply to any unit of four lines.]{.calibre7}

[Vasubandhu also considered this problem and used his spiritual power to find an answer. According to the [Bronze Memorial Record]{.italic} (T'ung Pei Chi), "When Vasubandhu ascended to the Tushita Palace he asked Maitreya Bodhisattva which four-line gatha the Buddha was referring to in the [Diamond Sutra]{.italic}. Maitreya said, 'No perception of a self, no perception of a being, no perception of a life, and no perception of a soul.'" (quoted by Yen Ping) Since these four lines are not one of the two verses in this sutra (which appear at the end of Chapters Twenty-six and Thirty-two), it suggests that Vasubandhu's understanding of "gatha" did not, as noted above, refer to a four-line poem but simply a unit of comparable length. Further support for this view comes from the fact that the sutra's central teaching has now been presented, and no gathas have appeared, while the Buddha has repeatedly stressed non-attachment to these four perceptions of self, being, life, and soul as essential to the bodhisattva path.]{.calibre7}

[Regardless of which gatha, if any, the Buddha had in mind, the conclusion itself deserves attention. In what sense is the body of merit produced by this teaching greater than the body of merit produced by the stupendous act of material charity mentioned above? Is this body of merit not also "no body of merit"? And if so, how can one no-body be greater than another no-body? Once again, the Buddha turns our world inside out. One no-body can be greater than another no-body if that no-body is a buddha dharma. The Buddha does not want Subhuti to think that just because all things are empty they are useless. Although material and spiritual charity are empty, the power of the latter to help liberate others ensures it of a place in the repertoire of all buddhas and bodhisattvas. Thus, their body of merit is infinitely greater. It has to be if they are to liberate all beings.]{.calibre7}

[This chapter explains the difference between the arhan and bodhisattva paths. Arhans are able to attain liberation from suffering and rebirth, but as long as they remain limited by the emptiness and detachment of their practice, they can be of no help to others. Here, and in the following chapter, the Buddha contrasts these two spiritual paths in order to reveal the true nature of this teaching. Here, we also see somewhat more clearly the connection between the bodies produced and obtained by bodhisattvas and buddhas with buddhahood. For the bodies of both are one and the same body. Both bodies have the same source and are simply synonyms for the experience of enlightenment. The difference is the difference between the child and the adult.

Subhuti already understands the truth of formlessness but does not know how to use the truth of formlessness to obtain formless merit or whether such merit would be better than what has form. Hence, the Buddha uses the example of charity that has form and finds it unequal to the merit of keeping in mind a single gatha of this sutra. Because all buddhas come from prajna, thus its merit is great. Likewise, people say, 'The mother is known by her children.' But although prajna can give birth to the dharmas of buddhas, prajna is not itself a dharma of buddhas. Thus is it said that buddha dharmas are no buddha dharmas."]{.calibre7}

[WHILE SUBHUTI RE-CONSIDERS the nature of enlightenment and the origin of "sages," the Buddha asks him about the four stages of practice through which Subhuti and his fellow shravakas have passed on their way to "sagehood." As their names make clear, all four reflect a concern with ending the cycle of birth and death. But if these would-be sages succeeded in not being reborn, how then could they "arise from the uncreated?" Such a goal is sterile. There is no compassion in Subhuti's path. Despite its emphasis on detachment, it is self-centered, not being-centered. The shravaka's quest for no rebirth is not the same as the bodhisattva's realization of no birth. The difference is profound. Shravakas dam the river. Bodhisattvas swallow it at its source.]{.calibre7}

[Despite his interest in the bodhisattva path, Subhuti is still a shravaka, "one who hears from a distance" or "above the din." This word originally referred to those disciples who actually heard the Buddha teach. These early disciples, and their later followers, saw themselves progressing through a series of four stages to the final goal of arhanship, which they considered more or less equivalent to buddhahood. But from the Mahayana point of view, shravakas are still far from the goal, for they are held back by the selfishness of their detachment from the self. Although Subhuti has attained the final fruit of such practice, he clearly has not yet attained the goal of buddhahood. Still, Subhuti is not about to slight his fellow shravakas and does his best to represent their level of attainment as essentially equal to that of bodhisattvas. For they, too, are free of attachments to a self, a being, a life, and a soul. But they neither produce nor obtain the infinite body of merit that comes from liberating others. For unless detachment is based on compassion, it may lead to nirvana, but it does not lead to buddhahood.]{.calibre7}

[This was the first of the four stages through which early Buddhist practitioners saw themselves progressing in their search for liberation from suffering. A person who reached this stage was called a [srota-apanna]{.italic} (river-finder), one who had found the River of Impermanence. It was the Buddha's teaching of impermanence that led his disciples to take this first step on the spiritual path. Seeing the existence of all things as dependent on countless causes and conditions, and thus devoid of any self-nature, the srota-apanna sees things as-they-are, as no-things. This vision of emptiness is the river discovered by the srota-apanna. In the final stage of his own journey of discovery, Shakyamuni abandoned his cave on Pragbodhi and walked down to the shore of the nearby Nairanjana River, waded across to the other side, entered the forested sanctuary of Bodhgaya, sat down beneath a pippala tree, confronted the problem of impermanence, and realized unexcelled, perfect enlightenment. Thus, for the Buddha the River of Impermanence became the River of Liberation.]{.calibre7}

Buddhists list five such views or beliefs: the belief in an individual (such as a self or soul), the belief in extremes (such as idealism or nihilism), the belief in no morality (such as the absence of karma), the belief that what they believe is right regardless of evidence to the contrary (such as holding wrong to be right), and the belief in ascetic practices (such as those that are injurious to one's health).]{.calibre7}

[While srota-appanas are free from such views, they are still subject to the afflictions, or thoughts, that arise in their karmic wake. Here, too, five kinds of thought are usually mentioned: ignorance, greed, anger, pride, and doubt. But other lists are also common. In any case, once they attain this stage, srota-apannas no longer create any new karma. But while they are no longer subject to rebirth among sinners in Hell or hungry ghosts, animals or asuras, as a result of their previous karma they are reborn seven more times among humans or gods.]{.calibre7}

The last three stages, which are discussed in the sections that follow, all depend on and are anticipated by the first. It should also be noted that in the scriptures that many scholars agree represent the Buddha's earliest teaching, such as the Pali [Nikayas]{.italic} and Sanskrit [Agamas]{.italic}, the lay faithful are included in this and the following two stages of attainment but not in the final stage of the arhan.]{.calibre7}

["To return once more" is a translation of [sakrid-agamin]{.italic}, which is the second of the four stages of the Hinayana path. Most commentators interpret this to mean rebirth in one of the heavens followed by one last rebirth among humans, after which one then attains liberation in one of the heavens. It is, however, possible to by-pass this stage and thus avoid the need for any further rebirth.

[As previously noted, srota-apannas are able to cut off the deluded views associated with the Three Realms but remain beset by the deluded thoughts that arise from greed, anger, delusion, pride, and doubt. Buddhists break these deluded thoughts into nine levels of severity. Sakrid-agamins manage to eliminate the first six of these nine levels but not the last and subtlest of the three. Hence, they must return to the Realm of Desire one more time.

[Tao-yuan says, "Why are sakrid-agamins said to return once more? Because although they have cut off deluded views, they have not yet cut off deluded thoughts. Even though we understand that we should not indulge our desires, we still have desires. This is the difference between the deluded views that we acquire and the deluded thoughts with which we are born. Such thoughts not only come from our last life but from many lives. Although we can't get rid of the nine levels of deluded thoughts all at once, if we can get rid of the first six, we reach the stage of the sakrid-agamin and can get rid of the remaining three in our next life. Thus the sakrid-agamin must return once more. However, since in the first stage practitioners get rid of the differentiating mind, by the time they reach the sakrid-agamin stage, their minds have no perception of going or returning." This is the reason some srota-apannas are said to bypass this stage, because they have no perception of it taking place.]{.calibre7}

[The fourth and final stage of Hinayana attainment is that of the arhan.

Dharmagupta has simply [wu-cheng hsing]{.italic} (practice non-contention).

The Tibetan comes somewhat closer than the Chinese here with [non mons pa med par gnas pa ranms kyi chog]{.italic} (foremost among those who dwell free of trouble). Kumarajiva alone among translators renders [viharin]{.italic} (in the last two of its three occurrences) as [le]{.italic} (delight in), despite his previous choice of [san-mei]{.italic} (samadhi/to focus mentally). All others (including Edgerton) render it [chu]{.italic} (to dwell). Its original meaning, however, appears to have been "to wander." Eventually, though, even wanderers have to dwell somewhere. Hence, the term was used for the place where wanderers took up their temporary abode, namely, in viharas. Thus "wanderers" became "dwellers," and the term is used in this sense elsewhere in this sutra---at the very beginning of Chapter One and also at the end of Chapter Twelve. Dharmagupta does not include either occurrence of [aham asmi arhan]{.italic} (I am an arhan/free from rebirth), while Yi-ching does not include [vita-ragas]{.italic} (without desires).

[IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER, the Buddha considered the attainments of shravakas. He now turns to bodhisattvas and their attainments. Just as Subhuti cited his own experience of the four stages of the shravaka path, the Buddha recalls his career as a bodhisattva. He begins with the nature of the dharma he realized at the end of that path and proceeds to examine the ramifications of such realization. For while arhans disappear in the ashes of nirvana, bodhisattvas remain in the world to liberate others. Also, their realization of the nature of reality and their teaching of such realization necessarily involve the transformation of the world and the offering of their body of merit for the benefit of others. But the Buddha now warns against attachment to any such attainment, transformation, or offering. For the bodhisattva's realization is no realization; the bodhisattva's transformation is no transformation; and the bodhisattva's offering is no offering. Thus, the bodhisattva's body of merit is said to be without measure.]{.calibre7}

[In the previous chapter, the Buddha examined the stages through which shravaka practitioners passed on their way to arhanship. The arhan, however, is not the goal of Mahayana practice. Although arhans are free of passion, they are also free of compassion. Subhuti has realized freedom from rebirth, but he is still caught in the emptiness of the uncreated. Hence, the Buddha proceeds to examine his own career as a bodhisattva and the nature of the resulting merit in order to free Subhuti and his fellow arhans from their "freedom."]{.calibre7}

[The example Shakyamuni chooses is his meeting with Dipankara Buddha, for it was at this meeting that the necessary cause was set in motion that resulted in the Buddha's buddhahood. According to accounts in both the Pali and Sanskrit canons, this meeting took place after Shakyamuni had cultivated the bodhisattva path for nearly two [asankhya]{.italic} (infinite) kalpas.

[According to the [Maha Prajnaparamita Shastra]{.italic}: (9), when Dipankara was born, his body glowed like a lamp. Hence he was named Dipankara, or "Glowing Lamp." And when he became a buddha, he retained this name. Like Shakyamuni, Dipankara was a prince. He was the last of eight princes who realized buddhahood while studying under Suryarashmi Buddha. At that time, Shakyamuni was the last of sixteen sons of another king, all of whom left home to become monks. During this incarnation, Shakyamuni was named Sumedha, and he lived in the Himalayas as an ascetic. After coming into possession of five hundred gold coins, he decided to give them to his teacher. But as he entered the royal city of Dipavati, he saw that the city was decked out in banners and flowers and its streets were all watered to prevent dust from rising. Upon asking, he was told that this was all in honor of Dipankara Buddha, whose arrival was eagerly awaited by all the people in the city. As he saw Dipankara approaching, Sumedha was overcome with joy and used his five hundred gold coins to buy five golden lotuses, and he scattered their petals on the roadway. Seeing a puddle in the path of the approaching buddha, Sumedha uncoiled his hair, lay down on the ground, and spread his hair in the water for Dipankara to step on. After walking across Sumedha's hair, Dipankara stopped and prophesied that ninety-one kalpas and twenty-four buddhas later, Sumedha would become the buddha named Shakyamuni.]{.calibre7}

[The purpose of bringing up this meeting is to contrast the bodhisattva's attainment with that of the arhan's. For it was during this encounter that the Buddha realized the forbearance of birthlessness, which is the final attainment of the bodhisattva, the ability to know and to bear the knowledge that nothing arose in the past, nothing now arises, and nothing will arise in the future. There is no greater traumatic experience or knowledge for someone on the spiritual path. Hence, such forbearance or acceptance requires kalpas of preparation.]{.calibre7}

[When bodhisattvas realize the forbearance of birthlessness, the worlds in which they stand and walk are forever altered as a result of their attainment. Thus did Shakyamuni illuminate this realm within which we hear and practice the Dharma, while Amita did the same for the buddha realm to the west, and Akshobya did so for the realm to the east. As bodhisattvas and buddhas create realms suited to the beings they have vowed to liberate, they also manifest works aimed at saving those beings. Such works, however, do not necessarily transform the material environment but rather affect the spiritual environment of the realms in which they liberate beings.

[Buddhas and bodhisattvas transform a world in order to liberate the beings who live in that world. Thus, the Buddha returns to the teaching that began this sutra, giving birth to the thought of liberating all beings. Although such a thought is not immune to attachment, only such a thought is capable of no attachment. For only such a thought confronts the illusions of space and time with enough force to break through them. Here, however, liberation is preceded by transformation---but transformation that is no transformation. For what is there to be transformed? Thus, the mind transforms without transforming.]{.calibre7}

[With the word [purusha]{.italic} (person), the Buddha reaches back to the earliest strata of the Indian psyche to the myth of Purusha, the heroic being who sacrificed himself and thereby created the world and mankind out of his dismembered parts. Thus, by [purusha]{.italic} Indians understand "man," and from the same dismembered body the English language gets the word "person." And because the world and its human beings are the result of an act of renunciation, or charity, the Buddha uses Purusha (and uses him again in Chapters Thirteen and Seventeen) to represent the conception some disciples might have of the body of merit that bodhisattvas obtain from the practice of this teaching. For not only do bodhisattvas transform the world, they transform their own existence. The same cannot be said of arhans, who renounce their self-existence as well as the possibility of future rebirths or future bodies and thus the means to liberate others. And yet despite their transformed existence, bodhisattvas are not attached to their existence, for every existence is no existence. Even an existence as majestic as that of Purusha or Mount Sumeru turns out to be no existence. And yet, once a mountain is seen to be no mountain, neither is it not a mountain.]{.calibre7}

[IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER, the Buddha outlined the attainments of the bodhisattva, all of which turned out to be no attainments: no truth realized, no world transformed, no colossal spiritual self offered up to others. But the Buddha is concerned that his disciples might now conclude that since nothing is attained, there is no need to cultivate the merit upon which such non-attainment is based. Throughout this sutra, the Buddha compares two kinds of merit: the merit from material offerings and the merit from the offering of liberation. The merit that comes from giving material things is like a pearl, beautiful to behold but essentially flawed and easily ground into powder, while the merit that comes from understanding and sharing this teaching with others is like a diamond, radiant, indestructible, and able to cut through all things. And it alone leads to buddhahood.]{.calibre7}

[The Ganga (Ganges) is a celestial river that was brought down to earth in the Himalayas. According to ancient Indian geography, it was one of four great rivers that flowed from Lake Anavatapta in Southwestern Tibet. From this legendary lake's southern shore flowed the Indus, which emptied into the Southwest (Arabian) Sea. From the lake's western shore flowed the Oxus (Amu Darya), which emptied into the Northwest (Aral) Sea. From the lake's northern shore flowed the Sita, which emptied into the Northeast (Pohai) Sea between China and Korea. The Sita was also called the Yarkand Darya or Tarim River, and nowadays it disappears into the sands of the Taklamakan Desert near the nuclear test site of Lop Nor. But once upon a time, and it would have to have been Paleolithic time, it formed the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Finally, from the lake's eastern shore flowed the Ganges, which emptied into the Southeast Sea (Bay of Bengal) between India and Bangladesh.]{.calibre7}

[The Buddha also reminds Subhuti that understanding begins with something as small as a grain of sand. Like William Blake, the Buddha asks us to see a world in every grain. But here, the Buddha asks us not only to see a world but to see all the sand in that world as well and then to imagine that each grain of sand in that world is, itself, a world. In this manner, the Buddha stretches our conceptions of size and number beyond the limits of comprehension. In Chapter Eight, the Buddha compared the merit from an offering of the billion jewel-covered worlds of a universe. Here, he expands that offering beyond the power of calculation. Such is the Buddha's way of leading us to break through the finite to the realm of the infinite, which is the purpose of this sutra.]{.calibre7}

In other Mahayana sutras, rubies, agate, coral, and black mica also appear in the list. Some scholars think these seven were an elaboration of the seven treasures of the state: the king and his ministers, the territory and the capital, the treasury, the army, and allies. More likely, they were simply manifestations of the sacred number that seven represents. They also call to mind the Indian system of analysis by means of which all material things are divided into a series of greater or smaller entities, each of which is composed of seven equal parts.]{.calibre7}

[In any case, by asking us to imagine an offering of the most precious of substances in amounts beyond the power of calculation or comprehension, the Buddha sets the stage for an offering of something that seems to be the most insignificant of things and yet is the most inconceivable of things. The Buddha knows that people undertake spiritual cultivation with a goal in mind, namely the goal of acquiring and accumulating religious merit so that they might gain a better rebirth and access to the sanctum of their chosen faith. But the body of merit they thereby acquire is limited in time and space and cannot compare to the body of merit of a bodhisattva who understands and shares this teaching with others.]{.calibre7}

[As noted in Chapter Eight, a gatha refers to the shortest metrical unit of ancient India, which was usually a four-line poem. Since gathas were used to summarize longer prose sections of a sutra, they were used extensively in oral transmission of sacred teachings. In China, the gatha was the seal of understanding every Zen student composed upon breaking through the bonds of delusion. Thus, a gatha is much more precious than all the jewels in all the worlds one can possibly imagine. Despite their value to human beings, jewels possess the three characteristics of all other created dharmas: origination, limited duration, and dissolution, while the teaching of this sutra transcends such limitations and is the source of buddhahood. Hence, far greater merit results from offering even the smallest part of this sutra, not to buddhas, who no longer have any need for such a gift, but to other beings, all of whom possess the buddha nature yet who remain blind to its presence.]{.calibre7}

[In ancient India, the word [caitya]{.italic} (which is the word used here) referred to any sacred place, either natural, such as a grove or spring, or man-made, such as a mausoleum or shrine. It thus had a much wider application than the word [stupa]{.italic}, with which it later became confused and which referred exclusively to a conical structure erected to enshrine the relics of a buddha. It was at the Kapala Caitya (Alms Bowl Sanctuary) outside Vaishali that the Buddha told Ananda that if the Tathagata so desired he could live out the remainder of the kalpa. When Ananda failed to request that he do so, the Buddha announced that he would die within three months ([Maha Parinibbana Sutta]{.italic}: 3). Hence, caityas were originally sanctuaries and only later identified with the stupas constructed within them. Here a stupa is meant. For when the Buddha mentions caityas again in Chapter Fifteen he does so in connection with making prostrations and circumambulations. In addition to such acts of veneration, pilgrims also honored stupas with offerings of the seven jewels, fruits, flowers, and incense, sacred images and scriptures. When Yi-ching visited India during the seventh century, he reported that the Gatha of the Chain of Causation was especially popular as an offering among the Buddhist pilgrims who frequented these holy sites. In his commentary, Conze notes, "In past ages these shrines were something to reckon with. Respect for them assured the prosperity of nations, and they were inviolate sanctuaries for people in fear for their lives."]{.calibre7}

[In the [Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines]{.italic}, the Buddha tells Shakra, King of the Gods, "The place in which one takes up, bears in mind, preaches, studies, spreads, demonstrates, expounds, explains or repeats this perfection of wisdom, in that place beings cannot be hurt by men or ghosts, nor can they be injured or overpowered by them, except as a punishment for their past deeds, because this perfection of wisdom makes the spot where it is found into a true shrine for beings, worthy of being worshiped and adored, into a shelter for beings who come to it, a refuge, a place of rest, and final relief." (3) While it would seem that the Buddha is using [caitya]{.italic} here in the sense of "sanctuary," immediately after this statement, Shakra then asks the Buddha to compare the merit from honoring this teaching to that from building caityas. Hence, throughout the perfection of wisdom texts, [caitya]{.italic} usually has the meaning of "stupa."]{.calibre7}

[One of a buddha's ten titles is [shasta deva-manu-shyanam]{.italic} (teacher of devas and humans). The term [deva]{.italic} refers to beings who inhabit the various heavens in the realms of Desire, Form and Formlessness. Free of passion, they are also relatively free of suffering, but they are still bound by the law of karma and destined to be reborn in less happy realms. Hence, they, too, seek the Dharma.

Basically, asuras have the karma of gods but not their happy disposition. Instead of enjoying their good fortune, they make war on gods. Still, they have a special affinity for the Dharma and are viewed as its protectors.]{.calibre7}

[In the centuries between the Buddha's Nirvana and the beginning of the Christian Era, stupa worship became the major focus of lay participation in Buddhism, and some say the basis for the development of Mahayana Buddhism. The stupa not only represented the teacher, the stupa was the teacher. The stupa was the finger pointing to the moon. But it was not separate from the moon. The fires of Nirvana notwithstanding, the stupa was the Buddha's apparition body, transformed, and also the Buddha's reward body and dharma body as well. Likewise, wherever this teaching is present, the Buddha's three bodies are present. For those who practice this teaching and explain it to others produce and obtain a body of merit that appears in space and time while remaining free of the limitations of space and time. Not only do buddhas arise from this teaching, all those who teach this teaching necessarily arise from it as well. In the [Maha Prajnaparamita Sutra]{.italic}, (28) the Buddha tells Shakra that as long as the perfection of wisdom is present in the world, the Triple Jewel of the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha will continue to exist.]{.calibre7}

[SUBHUTI HAS FINALLY BEGUN to understand this teaching and asks for a name by which to remember it. The Buddha not only gives us a name, he shows us how it works, as he applies this teaching first to the teaching itself, then to the world in which it is taught, and finally to those who teach it, all of which turn out to be empty of anything real. And if we would emulate such teachers, renunciation is of no help. For anything we might renounce is equally illusory. Hence, the Buddha does not suggest we renounce anything. For renunciation is also attachment. This is where arhans and bodhisattvas part company. The Buddha asks us simply to see things as they are and to share this vision with others. Buddhas do not arise from emptiness but from this teaching, which liberates us from both delusions and emptiness as well as from the renunciation of delusions and emptiness.]{.calibre7}

[The name of a sutra, however, is normally not given until the final chapter. The fact that Subhuti asks this question at this point has led a number of commentators to wonder if this does not represent an earlier conclusion to which the remaining chapters were later appended. Others contend that this simply marks the end of the first half of the sutra and that Subhuti was merely expressing his awareness that the Buddha had answered the set of questions that began this discourse, namely, how a shravaka should travel the bodhisattva path. The remaining chapters, according to this view, were not added as an afterthought but expand on the Buddha's initial answers.

Previously, he was limited by his attachment to emptiness and served, more or less, as a foil for the Buddha's teaching of the perfection of wisdom. Although Subhuti still has much to learn about this teaching, from this point on his understanding is praised by the Buddha.

["Perfection of Wisdom" is a translation of [prajna-paramita]{.italic}. Depending on how the word is parsed, paramita can be read as a combination of [param-ita]{.italic} and mean "what leads to the other shore," or it can be derived from [parama]{.italic} (supreme/ultimate), in which case it would mean "perfection." Nagarjuna and most Chinese commentators prefer the former, while Asanga and most other Indian commentators prefer the latter. However, it is clear from its usage in Chapter Fourteen---[parama-paramita]{.italic} (best of perfections)---that the latter is meant. As for [prajna]{.italic}, it, too, has several meanings. It is usually translated by "wisdom," but at times it comes close to being a synonym of shunyata (emptiness). However, [prajna]{.italic} refers to the logic of emptiness. And it is the usefulness of this logic that Subhuti now realizes. For emptiness means absence or negation, while the perfection of wisdom means the absence or negation of what is false, not the absence or negation of what is real.]{.calibre7}

The same is true for the other perfections. Thus, the perfection of wisdom gets its name from its supreme excellence. The five perfections are thus contained in the perfection of wisdom, and the term 'perfection of wisdom' is just a synonym for the fulfillment of all six perfections." (3)]{.calibre7}

[None of the things that fill our lives is by itself false. It is only our conceptualization and attachment that make them false. Meanwhile, the perfection of wisdom transforms these obstacles into aids to enlightenment. At the end of Chapter Six, the Buddha likened his teachings to a raft and told Subhuti to let go of all teachings, all dharmas as well as no dharmas. Just as the no dharma of emptiness must be put aside, the dharma of prajna must also be left behind, lest it become a new obstruction or attachment. Thus, such a teaching not only transcends the world of language, it also transcends itself. No other teaching is so self-effacing and yet so sure of itself. It is self-effacing because it asserts nothing. And it is sure of itself because it asserts nothing. It frees us of all assertions and opens the door to all knowledge.

The Bhagavan replied, "I have been among you for forty-nine years, and yet I have not spoken a single word. You ask me to continue turning the Wheel of the Dharma. But have I, in fact, ever turned the Wheel of the Dharma?

When Shakra replied that Subhuti had said nothing and that he had heard nothing, Subhuti praised his understanding as constituting "true prajna." In the [Perfection of Wisdom in Eighteen Thousand Lines]{.italic}, Subhuti tells the gods, "In the perfection of wisdom not even a single word has been spoken.

It is, however, the result of karma and is not his real body.

[Since the self is not real, what merit can there be from such an offering? Throughout this sutra, the Buddha repeatedly points out that making offerings of what we hold most dear to those whom we most venerate cannot compare to making an offering of this teaching to other deluded beings. But not only is this teaching of prajna no teaching, and the world in which it is taught no world, and the teacher who teaches it no teacher, the self who makes an offering of this teaching is no self. Such understanding as this gives birth to the bodhisattva's infinite body of merit, which is the sanbhoga-kaya, the selfless no-body that each bodhisattva acquires upon practicing this teaching. The attainment of such a body of merit contrasts sharply with Subhuti's practice of self-renunciation, whereby he had freed himself of desires and was waiting for the fires of nirvana to consume his physical body, after which he would receive no further body.

[SUBHUTI IS OVERWHEMMED by this teaching. At the beginning of this sutra, when he asked the Buddha how someone could travel the bodhisattva path, he was not prepared to have journeyed so far so soon and is overcome by emotion, which is itself revealing of the difference between the shravaka and bodhisattva paths, especially as it comes from an arhan who earlier described himself as "free from passion." This is an example of what later became known as the "sudden enlightenment" school of Buddhism in which the emotional impact of a teaching does what meditation and reflection are unable to do. In the space of what amounts to a few minutes, Subhuti has gone from arhan to bodhisattva. And to demonstrate his newfound understanding, he summarizes what he considers this sutra's principal teaching thus far: freedom from perceptions that are no perceptions. Although the Buddha approves, he urges Subhuti to look beyond "no perceptions," lest "no perceptions" become a substitute for his earlier attachment to emptiness. He tells Subhuti to practice the perfection of wisdom, to practice the perfection of forbearance, to practice the perfection of charity. For only in the course of practice do "no perceptions" become the means by which bodhisattvas realize enlightenment and the means by which they teach other beings. Once again, the Buddha reminds Subhuti that freedom from perception by itself liberates no one, whereas those who uphold this teaching join the lineage of teachers of humans and gods that extends throughout the ten directions and three periods of time.]{.calibre7}

[Subhuti's reaction provides an example of the power of this sutra to change the life of someone whose karma has nearly run its course. Although Subhuti is an arhan and living his last life, he now realizes that there is more to the Buddha's teaching than the doctrine of emptiness and that his cultivation of selflessness has been, ironically, selfish. He realizes that true selflessness is practiced by those who help others put an end to suffering, as the Buddha does through this teaching. How could Subhuti not be moved upon hearing such a teaching while he still has the opportunity to put it into practice?]{.calibre7}

[Subhuti is foremost among the Buddha's disciples in his understanding of emptiness and must have been aware of how difficult it was for his contemporaries to grasp and believe a teaching that transcends both existence and non-existence. And since understanding diminishes over cosmic time, Subhuti was also aware that beings in the future would have even greater obstacles to surmount in comprehending such a teaching. And yet the greater the difficulty in understanding such a teaching, the greater the merit. Thus those who do so in the future shall be most blessed of all.]{.calibre7}

[Subhuti restates what he sees as the one condition necessary for implementing this teaching: freedom from perceptions. If the mind contains a single delusion, it doesn't have room for emptiness. And if it doesn't have room for emptiness, it doesn't have room for prajna. Still, there is more to this teaching than emptiness and prajna. Although Subhuti has advanced since claiming in Chapter Seven that "sages arise from what is uncreated," he still thinks freedom from perceptions is the defining attribute of a bodhisattva, that anyone who is free of perceptions of a self, a being, a life, and a soul must be on the path to buddhahood. But this is the mind-set of an arhan, not a bodhisattva. What Subhuti does not yet realize is that perceptions and no perceptions are all grist for a bodhisattva's dharma mill and are the means by which bodhisattvas, as Lao-tzu said, "empties the mind / but fills the stomach."

[The Buddha does not praise Subhuti's last statements, only his first, as he expands on Subhuti's explanation of why beings in the future will be able to believe and practice this teaching. Instead of stressing freedom from perceptions, as Subhuti does, the Buddha stresses freedom from fear, the absence of the psychological or emotional trauma from believing a doctrine that turns out to be devoid of any doctrine and that the Buddha calls the best of doctrines. Everyone relies on some sort of teaching. But the best of teachings taught by all buddhas deprives those who would follow it of any teaching at all. At the same time, the Buddha's statement exposes the relative value of all teachings, including his own. This teaching first strips away the self of ordinary people. It then strips away the dharmas of beginning practitioners. Finally, it strips away the emptiness of arhans. Each of these is a terrifying experience. How can we not have a self? How can there not be dharmas to cultivate? What is left if emptiness is empty? Can such a teaching be taught by anyone other than a buddha?

[The Buddha is concerned that Subhuti's understanding of this teaching begins and ends with prajna. But prajna does not exist in isolation and cannot be practiced without practicing the other perfections. In this sutra, the Buddha focuses on three of the Six Perfections, namely, those that counteract the Three Poisons: the perfection of charity, which counteracts the poison of desire, the perfection of wisdom, which destroys the poison of delusion, and the perfection of forbearance, which eliminates the poison of anger. Although this sutra only mentions these three by name, each is closely related to the other perfections: charity with morality, forbearance with vigor, and wisdom with meditation. Thus, by focusing on these three, the sutra provides instruction in all six. The reason the Buddha mentions forbearance here is that without it bodhisattvas will not be able to endure what is the most traumatic teaching they will ever experience or know.]{.calibre7}

[King Kali once went hunting accompanied by his harem of concubines. After pausing to eat lunch, the king lay down and took a nap, while the women wandered into the forest to gather flowers. Eventually, they came upon the place where the ascetic Kshanti was sitting in meditation. They were so overcome by his serenity, they laid their flowers before him as an offering. Kshanti then proceeded to talk to them about things they had never heard and about which they were eager to learn more. On waking, the king went looking for his concubines, and when he saw them sitting before an ascetic, he flew into a rage. When Kshanti tried to explain that he was teaching them about forbearance, the King decided to test Kshanti and proceeded to cut off his hands, then his feet, and finally his ears and nose. When the king saw that Kshanti remained unmoved, he realized the cruelty of what he had done and asked Kshanti's forgiveness. Kshanti said he was not angry and there was no need to ask for forgiveness. The king asked Kshanti to prove that he wasn't angry. Kshanti said, "If there is no anger in my heart, may my body be restored to its original condition." And as a result of the merit Kshanti had accumulated over many lifetimes, his body was instantly restored. He then told the king, "You have just used the sword of delusion to cut off the parts of my body. When I attain buddhahood, I shall use the sword of wisdom to cut off your passions." ([Nirvana Sutra]{.italic}: 31) Kshanti was a previous incarnation of Shakyamuni, and King Kali was reborn as Kaundinya, the Buddha's first disciple.]{.calibre7}

[The word [kali]{.italic} in Sanskrit means "strife," as in the expression [kali-yuga]{.italic} (age of strife), which is, according to Hindu mythology, the final age in this present kalpa. Kali is also the son of Krodha, whose name means "anger." The name is also given to the wife of Shiva, the Hindu personification of destruction. Hence, the choice here is intended to emphasize the forbearance of what upsets us the most: losing what we love and meeting what we hate.

[Will power alone cannot succeed in suppressing the poison of anger much less the perceptions of self or being that give birth to anger. Nor can an understanding of the doctrine of emptiness help. Such an ability is only possible through the cultivation of the perfections of wisdom, forbearance, and charity (and their counterparts of morality, vigor, and meditation). Again, the Buddha is reminding Subhuti that freedom from perception is not the goal but the means. The goal is liberation of all beings. Only by resolving to liberate all beings can bodhisattvas truly free themselves of the perception of being. And only when they are free of the perception of being can bodhisattvas liberate beings.

[As in Chapter Six, the Buddha reminds us of the power of this teaching. Those who believe it, who grasp it, and who teach it to others join the assembly of bodhisattvas taking place even now where they are known and seen by all buddhas. The word "merit" is related to our word for "memory." Merit is the memory of our good deeds. But only deeds free of memory can transcend the confines of space, time, and mind and lead all beings to buddhahood. The merit from believing, grasping, and explaining this teaching to others has no limit because it is free of concepts of self and other. Such merit is equivalent to wisdom itself. For it illuminates the ignorance of the world. How could the Tathagata not be aware of those responsible for the transformation of darkness into light? Also, the Tathagata is aware of them, for by means of their attainment, their future buddhahood becomes evident to all other buddhas. For they all share the same body.]{.calibre7}

[IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER, the Buddha told Subhuti that practicing the paramitas of wisdom, forbearance, and charity was possible only if the practitioner was free of such delusions as a self. In this chapter, he anticipates those who might take this to mean to get rid of the self, to sacrifice the self on the altar of some deity or cause or to throw the self into the black hole of nihilism. Although the Buddha says such actions do produce a certain amount of merit, he once again compares the greater merit produced by believing and sharing this teaching with others. And to this greater body of merit (the sanbhoga-kaya), he adds the robe of buddhahood (the nirmana-kaya) by means of which we too become teachers of gods and humans. For those who realize and transmit this teaching to others join the lineage of buddhas who are present throughout the three periods of time and the ten directions of space and who teach and liberate others through the power of the body of truth (the dharma-kaya), represented here by the sanctuary of a stupa. And just in case we doubt our ability to join this noble assembly, the Buddha tells us this teaching cannot be heard, believed, or practiced by those who do not share the bodhisattva's resolve to liberate all beings. Hence, we who now hear or encounter this teaching have already made this resolve and could not have made this resolve without first freeing ourselves of attachment to such delusions as self and being. The path is clear. We need only put on our robe and set forth.]{.calibre7}

[Again, the Buddha recalls the image of Purusha, the cosmic being whose sacrifice of his self-existence resulted in the creation of this world and its human race. During the Buddha's day, the members of most religious sects in India believed in the efficaciousness of such sacrifice and held that the practice of self-renunciation was an essential means to liberation. They reasoned that since sacrifice, properly performed, results in a divine response, the greater the sacrifice, the greater the response. And what sacrifice could be greater than one's own self, greater even that one's own body or life, both of which have spatial or temporal limits. Shakyamuni also spent years practicing austerities of self-denial to free himself from suffering. But he was honest enough to admit the futility of such practices. And it was only when he turned to the Middle Way between indulgence and austerity that he attained Enlightenment. Still, various forms of self-denial have continued to be cultivated by followers of the Buddha, and not only by those who are denigrated as members of Hinayana sects.]{.calibre7}

Thus, over the course of millions and trillions of kalpas, the number of illusory waves is far beyond reckoning. But all those illusions can't compare to the one reality---they can't compare to the sea. Noble sons and daughters are also like this. There is only the one sea of our buddha nature. But when people are confused, the sea of buddha nature becomes the sea of consciousness, and the sea of consciousness becomes the sea of passion, and the sea of passion becomes the sea of karma, and the sea of karma becomes the sea of suffering, and from the sea of suffering they receive countless, limitless karmic bodies. Thus, on top of confusion, they pile up confusion without end and without limit. But all those illusions can't compare to the one reality, namely, the true form of all dharmas."]{.calibre7}

[Thus far, the Buddha has asked no more of us than to keep in mind a single four-line gatha of this sutra and has said that such practice produces more merit than the performance of incredible acts of material charity. The Buddha now offers an equally stupendous example of mental charity. Still, this too turns out to be inferior to the merit produced by simply not maligning this teaching. Naturally, belief and understanding produce still more merit, and teaching others even more.

Here, the Buddha restates this principle. But he goes farther and says that if beings are still attached to these four perceptions, they will not hear, much less understand, this teaching.

[When Shakyamuni entered Nirvana and his body was cremated, the relics that remained were divided into eight equal parts and placed inside stupas in eight kingdoms of northern India. In the following century, these stupas were opened by King Ashoka and their contents further divided and distributed throughout India. A portion of these relics were eventually brought to China during the seventh century and subsequently lost when the T'ang dynasty collapsed in the tenth century. They were rediscovered several decades ago during the excavation of the ruins of what was once Chingshan Temple northeast of Sian, and I had the good fortune to see them during a visit to the area in 1990. Unaware of the true nature of the objects in their possession, the local authorities had simply placed the relics in a glass case in the Lintung Museum, a few miles from where they were unearthed. Although they have since been removed, they poured from a small glass vial onto a piece of black felt and looked like so many uncut and unpolished diamonds. There were dozens of them, and they must have totaled several carats.

[THE MORE CONSERVATIVE of the Buddha's followers must have viewed the teaching expressed in this chapter as radical, if not heretical. If they had difficulty accepting the perfection of wisdom, they must have ridiculed the idea that suffering on its behalf eliminates karma. Hence, it is not surprising that this teaching did not gain a large following until several centuries after the Buddha's Nirvana. But the Buddha anticipates such rejection and transforms it into the means to enlightenment. Here, too, he goes farther than we might expect and announces that even the body of merit he himself acquired as the result of countless lifetimes of devotion cannot compare to the body of merit acquired by someone who upholds this teaching, especially if they suffer on its behalf. For by enduring such suffering, noble sons and daughters are able to bypass the additional lifetimes needed, and which Shakyamuni himself needed, to transcend the bondage and obstructions of karma and to realize enlightenment. Enduring such suffering is part of the practice of forbearance, which becomes more important as we confront the true nature of all dharmas, and which Sumedha was able to do during his meeting with Dipankara. Such revolutionary statements as these were the harbingers of what later became known as the "sudden enlightenment" school of Buddhism. But if we plant a melon seed, we get melons. And if we cultivate an inconceivable teaching, can our harvest be anything other than inconceivable?]{.calibre7}

[The word [karma]{.italic} comes from the root [kri]{.italic}, meaning to "make" or "do," and refers to a deed. But it also refers to the manifold consequences of a deed, even though such results may take several lifetimes to mature. According to Buddhists, karma originates from any action of the body (behavior), the mouth (speech), or the mind (thought). The collective force of these three over the course of our most recent lifetimes (the limit is said to be seven) accounts for our present condition. However, we are free to change our karma by creating new karma or to transform it by seeing it for what it is, namely, delusion without any nature of its own that is itself the result of other delusions.]{.calibre7}

[The [apaya]{.italic} (unfortunate rebirths) mentioned by the Buddha include existence as an animal, a hungry ghost, or a sinner in one of the many hells. In this scheme, animals include the whole animal kingdom food chain, except for humans; hungry ghosts are creatures with big bellies and large appetites and mouths the size of a pin; and sinners inhabit their own myriad hells of guilt and retribution. Obviously, this scheme is not meant to be all-inclusive from a biological standpoint (the vegetable kingdom is missing). Rather, it is psychological and represents the unfortunate outcome of the Three Poisons of anger (animals), greed (hungry ghosts), and delusion (sinners). These three forms of existence are considered especially unfortunate because those who dwell in such realms can neither hear nor understand such teachings as this. But such is the power of the perfection of wisdom, it weakens, transforms, and eliminates the force of such karma, for karma only exists as long as we distinguish cause and effect, pleasure and pain, good and evil. And in the light of wisdom, all distinctions appear for what they are: delusions empty of any self-nature. Thus, while shravakas seek to bring karma to an end by bringing anger and desire to an end, bodhisattvas do so by bringing delusion to an end.]{.calibre7}

[One of the most important teachings of Buddhism's Mahayana revolution is the instantaneous elimination of lifetimes of karma and the equally sudden attainment of enlightenment. Most of the early followers of Shakyamuni felt that buddhahood was beyond their reach and aimed instead for liberation from suffering, which they held could only be achieved by progressing through a series of stages (such as those mentioned in Chapter Nine) whereby desires and attachments were gradually eliminated in the course of many lifetimes of practice. The Mahayana, however, approached liberation from the other side of the river, where perceptions of time and space do not apply. But this begs the question as to how one reaches such an understanding. Here, the Buddha supplies an answer. By suffering on behalf of this teaching, we speed up the process whereby our karmic obstructions are eliminated and enlightenment comes into view. For suffering on behalf of this teaching necessarily involves seeing such suffering in the light of the teaching on whose behalf we suffer. Thus, our suffering becomes the source of our liberation.]{.calibre7}

[In its simplest form, worship consists of four material offerings: food, clothing, bedding, and medicine. In its more expanded form, it includes various forms of bodily assistance and service. And in its widest form, it includes practicing and teaching others to practice the teaching that liberates all beings from suffering. In recalling the fruit of his practice over countless aeons, the Buddha provides yet another example of selflessness for the merit of this teaching to surpass.

[The Sanskrit for "infinite" is [asankhyeya]{.italic}. Every [maha]{.italic} (great) kalpa---the greatest imaginable unit of time---is said to be made up of four [asankhyeya]{.italic} kalpas: one of creation, one of duration, one of annihilation, and one of non-existence. Each of these in turn is made up of twenty minor ([antara]{.italic}) kalpas. And each of these consists of two phases, one of increase and one of decrease. During one of these minor kalpas, the lifespan of beings increases one year every hundred years until a lifespan of 84,000 years is reached, and then it decreases one year every hundred years until a lifespan of ten years is reached---when beings, at least human beings, can no longer reproduce. Thus, a minor kalpa lasts slightly less than 16,800,000 years, an asankhyeya kalpa lasts twenty times as long, or 236,000,000 years, and a great kalpa lasts four times as long, or 1,344,000,000 years. According to the standard account of Shakyamuni Buddha's career as a bodhisattva, he began practicing at the beginning of the first asankhyeya kalpa of the present great kalpa, and it was not until the end of the second asankhyeya kalpa that he met Dipankara. Thus, the text should read "during the two [asankhyeya]{.italic} (infinite) kalpas before I met Dipankara." But here the Buddha is not using [asankhyeya]{.italic} in its formal sense.]{.calibre7}

[While the body of merit produced and obtained from upholding this teaching exceeds that acquired by Shakyamuni over the course of countless lifetimes prior to his encounter with Dipankara, it does not exceed the body of merit acquired during his meeting with Dipankara. For it was at this meeting that Shakyamuni, as the ascetic Sumedha, realized the forbearance of birthlessness and reached the final stage of his career as a bodhisattva, a stage from which he could never again regress. This is why on that occasion Dipankara prophesied Sumedha's future buddhahood. And likewise, Shakyamuni now prophesies the future buddhahood of all those who uphold this teaching which leads to the same realization. This is why the Buddha uses this example. Those who uphold this teaching wear the same robe Shakyamuni wore, which carries with it the same responsibility to share this teaching with others and to be willing to suffer on its behalf. Also, since such practice is performed under conditions more difficult than those encountered by Sumedha (at the end of the current great kalpa rather than at its mid-point), the body of merit that results from such practice is bound to be greater than that of Sumedha prior to his meeting with Dipankara.]{.calibre7}

[SUBHUTI ASKS THE SAME QUESTIONS he asked in Chapter Two. But this is not a simple repetition. As if he were singing a song, Subhuti restates the opening theme. But since he first asked these questions, Subhuti has had his understanding turned upside down and has been moved to tears by the force of this teaching. He now re-examines his earlier questions in the light of what he has learned. Also, Subhuti's previous questions were those of a shravaka curious about the path. Subhuti asks again as a bodhisattva curious about the goal. The Buddha, however, is concerned that disciples such as Subhuti might become entangled by aspects of the path, including the goal. Hence, he reviews his own experience of the bodhisattva path to make clear that no dharma is of itself real, that what is real never sets forth on the bodhisattva path or realizes enlightenment or liberates anyone, that what is real is the selflessness and beginninglessness of all dharmas. In this chapter, the Buddha introduces us to the seventh perfection: the perfection of skillful means.]{.calibre7}

[In the previous section, the Buddha says there is no such dharma as setting forth on the bodhisattva path. He now says there is no such dharma as reaching the goal. For the non-existence of the one necessitates the non-existence of the other. Again, the Buddha cites his meeting with Dipankara, for it was at this meeting that he was acknowledged as having set forth on the bodhisattva path and destined to become a buddha. But if all the Buddha obtained was a prophecy of buddhahood and not the goal of buddhahood, why does he ask Subhuti if he realized enlightenment? Why does he ask about a dharma he was destined not to realize for many more lifetimes? Because for the purpose of this sutra, the Buddha equates enlightenment with the realization of the selfless, birthless nature of all dharmas, which was the realization that prompted Dipankara's prophecy.

[In Sanskrit, [tatha]{.italic} points to what is real and is usually translated as "thus" or "truly." It can also be shortened to [tath]{.italic}. Hence, [tathagata]{.italic} can be parsed as [tatha-gata]{.italic} and mean "thus gone" or as [tath-agata]{.italic} and mean "thus come," with the meaning dependent on the situation. It usually means "thus gone" when the emphasis is on liberation from sansara and realization of nirvana, and it means "thus come" when the emphasis is on appearing in the world to teach others. But regardless of whether a tathagata comes or goes or neither comes nor goes, a tathagata remains [bhutatathata]{.italic} (truly real) because a tathagata puts an end to all existence, past, present, and future and is free of such perceptions as coming or going. What is [tatha-ta]{.italic} (truly so) cannot be seen or realized because it has no beginning. Hence, a bodhisattva cannot set forth on a path that does not begin nor realize what never exists.

[Hui-neng says, "The Buddha says that this immense, perfect human body is not an immense body in order to show that all beings are not different from the dharma body. Because it has no boundaries, such a body is immense. And because the dharma body does not occupy a space or a place, he says it is not an immense body. Moreover, a person's physical body might be immense, but if there is no wisdom inside, it is not an immense body. And although a physical body might be small, if there is wisdom within, it can be called an immense body. But even if someone does possess wisdom, if they cannot practice accordingly, theirs is not an immense body. While someone who practices according to the teaching, who awakens to the peerless knowledge of buddhas, whose mind is not limited by subject or object, theirs is an immense body."]{.calibre7}

[This is one of the most puzzling concepts to Western students of Buddhism, but it is an essential part of every bodhisattva's repertoire of expedient skills. To liberate beings is to transform the world. And vice versa, to transform the world is to liberate beings. This conception of leading beings to a provisional, transformed spiritual state where they are more easily liberated became the basis of Pure Land Buddhism as well as Tantric Buddhism. But here, in the radical teaching of the perfection of wisdom, not only are beings not liberated, the world is not transformed by the bodhisattva's acts of renunciation or self-sacrifice. For unlike Purusha, bodhisattvas cannot find any self to sacrifice, much less a world to transform.]{.calibre7}

[The end is the beginning, and the beginning is the end. Bodhisattvas begin by not being attached to perceptions of self and end by not being attached to perceptions of self. The difference is the difference between our personal self and the dharma self. Because we imagine we have a self, all things to which we attribute reality must also have a self, or they would not be real. But on closer examination, our self turns out to be no self, and the self-nature of dharmas also turns out to be empty of any self. And yet, such selflessness is what constitutes a dharma.

[IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER, Subhuti repeated his initial set of questions, and the Buddha responded by telling him how bodhisattvas should stand and walk. In this chapter, he tells Subhuti how they should control their thoughts, which they do by transforming their thoughts into buddha dharmas, which they do by perceiving the selflessness of all dharmas. This is the practice of [upaya]{.italic}, or skillful means. But if bodhisattvas are to transform their thoughts, they first need to find their thoughts. Hence, the Buddha summons the concept of five eyes, which takes this teaching beyond the limited cultivation of emptiness and personal salvation characteristic of shravaka practitioners, such as Subhuti. For while Subhuti had acquired the first three of these eyes, he had no experience of the last two that see beyond the nihilism of emptiness to the compassionate awareness and liberation of other beings and by means of which Dipankara was able to see Sumedha's future buddhahood. The Buddha also mentions these eyes to remind Subhuti that bodhisattvas work in many dimensions and use countless means to liberate countless beings. This is what the Buddha means by "buddha dharmas." And this is also what he means by "resolving on selfless dharmas." Seeing that all dharmas are empty and without any self-nature is not enough. The only way bodhisattvas can liberate other beings is by making use of the very selfless dharmas to which beings are attached. Thus, the Buddha introduces us to the dharma eye and the buddha eye.]{.calibre7}

Thus, the Buddha teaches us that when we get rid of deluded thoughts, the five eyes become clear. When we cultivate the teaching of the prajnaparamita thought after thought, and we first eliminate delusions, this is called the physical eye. When we see that all beings possess the buddha nature, and we give birth to thoughts of compassion, this is called the divine eye. When we don't give birth to foolish thoughts, this is called the prajna eye. When we eliminate thoughts that are attached to dharmas, this is called the dharma eye. And when we free ourselves forever from the slightest doubt and everywhere shine our perfect light, this is called the buddha eye. It's also said that the divine eye sees that there is a dharma body within the physical body. The prajna eye sees that every being possesses the prajna nature. The dharma eye sees natures so clearly that subject and object are eliminated forever, and it sees that all buddha dharmas have always been present. And the buddha eye sees that the prajna-paramita is able to give birth to all the dharmas of the past, the future, and the present."]{.calibre7}

[Whenever the Buddha wanted an example of an infinitely great number or mass, he did not have far to look. Most of his years as a teacher were spent in towns and viharas, caityas and groves along the shores of the Ganges, a river whose sand is so fine it is more like mud than sand. But instead of denying the reality of these grains of sand, the Buddha affirms their existence, for he is now using his dharma eye rather than his prajna eye. The difference depends on whether he is concerned with the truth of emptiness or the truth of differences. Since he is here concerned with knowing the thoughts of beings in order to choose the most appropriate means by which to liberate them, his focus is on the dharma eye. The grains of sand in the Ganges are thus used here by the Buddha to help those of us whose vision is limited to our physical eyes to comprehend the infinite number of thoughts of all beings and the power of the prajna eye to perceive them and the power of the dharma eye to transform them.]{.calibre7}

[The Buddha now tells Subhuti how to control his thoughts. The Buddha is aware that Subhuti does not possess the dharma or buddha eyes. Hence, he examines thoughts with the prajna eye and sees that a past thought is already gone, a present thought undergoes constant change---Buddhists with time on their hands divide each thought into ninety moments and each moment into nine hundred cycles---and a future thought does not yet exist. Hence, viewed with the prajna eye, a thought cannot be found. It cannot be found because it has no self-nature. But because nothing is found, nothing obstructs the mind. Thus, a bodhisattva sees thoughts for what they are, delusions. But because they are empty of any self-nature, delusions share the same self-nature as enlightenment. Thus, a bodhisattva able to perceive the selfless nature of all thoughts is, as the Buddha pronounced at the end of the previous chapter, a fearless bodhisattva and destined for buddhahood.]{.calibre7}

[IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER, the Buddha told Subhuti how bodhisattvas control their thoughts. He now returns to the body of merit by means of which noble sons and daughters seek to advance on the bodhisattva path. In this chapter, the Buddha begins as he does in Chapter Eight, by asking Subhuti about the body of merit produced by the practice of charity, and much of this chapter is a verbatim repetition of the first half of that chapter. But unlike in Chapter Eight, the Buddha does not compare the bodies of merit produced by material and spiritual gifts. He has another purpose, which is to encourage Subhuti to seek the dharma eye and the buddha eye. Not only can a thought of enlightenment not be found, neither does a body of merit exist. And yet the Buddha speaks of a body of merit. Throughout this sutra, the Buddha has focused on the body of merit. He does not abandon it now, even the body of merit produced by an offering of material goods to those who have no need for such an offering. Rather he insists on it, and he insists on it precisely because it doesn't exist. The dharma eye sees beyond emptiness to what advances liberation. Delusion and enlightenment are inseparable.]{.calibre7}

[Again, it would seem that the Buddha is addressing a subject covered earlier. But, as he does elsewhere when he repeats previous questions or answers, the Buddha does so in order to lead us to a new and deeper understanding. The Buddha has told Subhuti how to control his thoughts by examining them with his prajna eye. The Buddha now turns to the body of merit and his dharma eye. Because Subhuti has been following the shravaka path, the Buddha asks him about the body of merit of someone whose practice is limited to devotional charity. As in Chapter Eight, Subhuti acknowledges that the body of merit of such a person is great. But it is only great. Also, in Chapter Eight, Subhuti's answer is merely preparatory for his further application of the logic of prajna: a body of merit is empty of any self-nature and thus no body of merit, and it is only on this basis that the Buddha speaks of a "body of merit."]{.calibre7}

Whereas the prajna eye sees only non-existence, the dharma eye sees connections, in this case a non-existing body of merit's connections with liberation. The Buddha speaks of what doesn't exist because what doesn't exist obstructs our path to enlightenment. If something actually existed, it could not be limited by time, by space, or by conceptual dimensions. This is the Buddhist definition of reality, which is the dharma body or true body of every buddha. But because we have not yet discovered anything real, because we have not yet found our dharma body or buddha-nature, the Buddha speaks of bodies of merit.

[THE BUDDHA NOW USES his buddha eye, which alone perceives his complete body of merit, his sanbhoga-kaya. Like all bodies of merit, it, too, depends on the gift. In the previous chapter, we heard that the gift of enough jewels to fill the billion worlds of this universe results in a body of merit that does not exist. But not only is this true for those who give material goods, this is also true for those who give this teaching. And yet this teaching gives rise to liberation, while the gift of material goods does not. Thus, this gift results in a body of merit that is both non-existent and existent but whose non-existence and existence are apparent only to the buddha eye, which alone sees beyond the duality of non-existence and existence. The reason the Buddha now speaks of his reward body is because he is concerned that those who practice this teaching might become attached to such a body and see it as some kind of higher self. Thus, Zen masters recommend, "When you meet the Buddha, kill the Buddha."]{.calibre7}

Also, if there is no enlightenment to realize, there is no result. Once cause and result are both cut off, there is no buddha. But now the perfectly developed physical body and attributes of the Tathagata appear before me. Where do they come from?'

[When the Buddha asks Subhuti about his [rupa-kaya]{.italic} (form body), we know from the Heart Sutra that [rupa]{.italic} (form) and [shunyata]{.italic} (emptiness) are the two sides of the same equation, that "form is emptiness, and emptiness is form. Form is no other than emptiness, and emptiness is no other than form." Hence, we can anticipate Subhuti's answer. But the question arises, to which of the Buddha's bodies is he referring as his [rupa-kaya]{.italic} (physical body)? By qualifying it with the word [parinishpatti]{.italic} (perfect development), he is pointing not to his [nirmana-kaya]{.italic}, or apparition body, but to his [sanbhoga-kaya]{.italic}, or reward body, which alone is perfect in form because it is formless. The Buddha is concerned that bodhisattvas might become attached to this body they produce and acquire as a result of their practice and fail to see the Tathagata's [dharma-kaya]{.italic}, or real body.]{.calibre7}

[Hui-neng says, "The Buddha is concerned that beings do not see his dharma body and only see its thirty-two attributes and eighty characteristics, such as its purple, burnished glow, and think of these as the Tathagata's true body. In order to eliminate this mistake, he asks Subhuti if the Buddha can be seen by means of his perfectly developed physical body or not. But the thirty-two attributes are not his perfectly developed physical body. The perfectly developed physical body is what contains the thirty-two pure practices. These pure practices are the six paramitas. The cultivation of the six paramitas in the five senses and the joint cultivation of meditation and wisdom in the mind are called the perfectly developed body. If you only care about the Tathagata's thirty-two attributes and don't cultivate the thirty-two pure practices within yourself, it is not the perfectly developed physical body. Whereas, if you don't care about the Tathagata's body but are able to observe the pure practices, this is called realizing the perfectly developed physical body."]{.calibre7}

Whereas this 'physical body' is the 'universal attribute.' The 'perfect development of the physical body' is perfect and complete. This refers to the bodily attributes of the reward body. The Buddha has three bodies: an incarnated body, a reward body, and a dharma body. The Tathagata who asks this question is the Buddha's dharma body. The dharma body has no attributes and cannot be seen by means of the reward body's perfectly developed body. Although its attributes are perfect, they are still attributes.

[Subhuti continues to rely on his prajna, or wisdom, eye. Hence, his awareness is limited to the essential emptiness of things. Thus, he sees that just as the body of merit of the previous chapter is no body, so, too, is the Buddha's reward body no body. For although it is ultimately one with the Buddha's real body, Subhuti sees only that aspect which is the result of causes and conditions and which therefore lacks any self-nature.]{.calibre7}

Because the dharma body that is not the perfectly developed physical body manifests all physical bodies according to causes and conditions, it is called the perfectly developed physical body. Form and attributes are both manifested by the dharma body. The embodiment of form is the dharma body. When form is empty, we can see the dharma body. The [Heart Sutra]{.italic} says 'form is emptiness.' Thus, in form we see the dharma body. And 'emptiness is form.' Thus, the dharma body is able to manifest all forms. The dharma body itself has no attributes. But if the dharma body cannot manifest form, who can see the Buddha? The [Avatamsaka Sutra]{.italic} says, 'The Buddha takes the Dharma for his body. It is pure and like space.' The physical eye of a mortal cannot see it. Only the prajna eye sees the emptiness of form and thus the dharma body of the Tathagata."]{.calibre7}

[Te-ch'ing says, "This is aimed at breaking the attachment to physical attributes of the reward body in order to reveal that the dharma and reward bodies are one. The perfectly developed physical body is the Buddha's reward body of myriad virtues and adornments. Because it is the result of liberating beings and purifying buddha lands for countless kalpas, the Tathagata speaks of it as a perfectly developed physical body. Since this reward body is essentially the dharma body, he says it is not a perfectly developed physical body. But since the reward and dharma bodies are one, he says it is called a perfectly developed physical body. First, he breaks through the attributes that are seen. Then, he breaks through the seeing that can see. Since the reward body is the dharma body, there are no attributes to be seen. Once wisdom and body are simply so, the defect of seeing is eliminated. And once the objective realm and wisdom merge into one, the dharma body reveals itself. The use here of such expressions as 'is' or 'is not' is meant to prevent beings from falling into the pitfall of affirmation or denial. Thus, in teaching the Dharma, there was nothing the Buddha could teach. All he did was protect beings from misconceptions by teaching them not to give birth to views and to get rid of their attachments. Students should realize that this is all he did."]{.calibre7}

The perfectly developed physical body mentioned by the Buddha is his reward body. The reward body is born of causes. It is the result of Shakyamuni's resolute practice over countless kalpas. Hence, it arises as the result of countless causes. Anything that arises from causes has no self-nature and is essentially empty. Thus, the Tathagata says his perfectly developed physical body is not perfect. Therefore, it is called perfect. Once you understand this, you can realize the dharma body of the Middle Truth. For the dharma body is neither empty nor existent. It is both empty and existent and neither empty nor non-existent."]{.calibre7}

The reality of the Buddha's reward body and its attributes consists in their being manifestations, albeit formless manifestations, of the Buddha's dharma body.]{.calibre7}

But when the prajna eye is completely clear, and such forms as self and other do not arise, and the true light of wisdom shines without cease, this is called the perfection of all attributes. If someone who has not yet eliminated the Three Poisons claims to see the Tathagata's true body, this is absolutely impossible. Even if they can see something, it is only the incarnated body.

[The attribute that is not possessed is the only visible attribute of the Buddha's real body. In fact, it is the Buddha's real body. Such an attribute, though, is not visible to the physical, divine, or prajna eyes but only to the dharma and buddha eyes. Since Subhuti only possesses the first three, he only perceives the essential emptiness of such attributes, not their reality. In Chapter Five, the Buddha tells Subhuti, "Subhuti, since the possession of attributes is thus an illusion, and no possession of attributes is no illusion, the Tathagata can, indeed, be seen but by means of attributes that are no attributes." But such vision requires the dharma eye, which Subhuti has not yet realized.]{.calibre7}

[Chi-fo says, "Previously, Chapter Five asked us to see the Tathagata without attributes. Chapter Thirteen said that rather than the falseness of seeing the Tathagata's thirty-two attributes, better the truth of grasping this sutra and seeing one's nature. This chapter says not only are his thirty-two attributes false, neither are his incarnations and supernatural powers his true appearance. While in general, the meaning of this and the fifth and thirteenth chapters are similar, their level of truth varies in depth. There are two points being made here. First, because the Buddha has no visible attributes, he is concerned that his disciples might wonder, if there is no body and no attributes, who is it who speaks the Dharma? Second, because the majority of those who cultivate in the dharma-ending age are attached to material appearances and given to such external practices as offering incense, flowers, and prostrations, they don't realize their own true nature. Thus, the Buddha once again warns them to break through the falsehood of bodies and attributes in order to reveal the truth that is free of falsehood."]{.calibre7}

[IN THE PREVIOUS TWO CHAPTERS, the Buddha re-examined subjects covered earlier, but with his dharma and buddha eyes. In the last chapter, he examined his sanbhoga-kaya, or reward body, which is the embodiment of realization. In this chapter, he asks Subhuti to consider the connection of such a body with his nirmana-kaya, or apparition body, which is the body in which a buddha appears in this world to teach others, and also with his dharma-kaya, which is the teaching itself. He also asks Subhuti to consider the nature of the teaching and the nature of those taught. Earlier, the Buddha said that a bodhisattva does not set forth on the bodhisattva path. He now says that having reached the end of that path neither does a buddha teach. This is because buddhas are not only not attached to such spatial entities as self and being or such temporal entities as life and rebirth, they are also not attached to such conceptual entities as dharmas and no dharmas. Hence, buddhas do not teach dharmas, much less no dharmas. But Subhuti wonders if people who live long after the Buddha's time can possibly believe a teaching that isn't taught. The Buddha answers that, indeed, there shall be such beings, but only those who are no beings. For not only are the teacher and the teaching empty names, so too are the beings who hear, believe, and practice such a teaching. No buddha, no dharma, no sangha. Upon hearing this teaching, some beings gnash their teeth. Others sing its praises.]{.calibre7}

And in Chapter Eight, the Buddha says, "From this \[teaching\] is born the unexcelled, perfect enlightenment of tathagatas, arhans, and fully-enlightened ones. And from this are born buddhas and bhagavans. And how so? Buddha dharmas, Subhuti, 'buddha dharmas' are spoken of by the Tathagata as no buddha dharmas. Thus are they called 'buddha dharmas.'" It turns out the Buddha does teach dharmas, but buddha dharmas, which are rafts and not ultimately real and which the Buddha does not want us to cling to but to use in reaching the far shore. The only dharma that is real is the Buddha's dharma body, the body of reality, concerning which the Buddha cannot teach or speak. As he says in Chapter Nineteen, he only speaks of what does not exist.]{.calibre7}

When Yama asked Ling-yu what good deeds he had done, the monk said he had recited the [Diamond Sutra]{.italic} every day for many years. When Yama asked to hear the sutra, Ling-yu recited the entire text from memory. But after Ling-yu had finished, Yama said, "Your sutra is missing a section. It's like a broken necklace. The complete text is carved on a stone stele at Chungli Temple in Haochou. Go back and find the missing section, and I will give you ten more years to propagate its teaching." Suddenly, Ling-yu came back to life. When he reported his encounter to the emperor, the emperor ordered his officials to find the stele, which turned out to be Bodhiruci's translation, and which was then used to rectify Kumarajiva's omission. Chiang Wei-nung, however, calls this account into question, noting that copies of the "defective" text were still in use at court in 824 and suggests the "correction" took place sometime in the following century.]{.calibre7}

[IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTERS, the Buddha examined the nature of his reward and apparition bodies, which are the bodies obtained upon realizing and teaching the dharma of unexcelled, perfect enlightenment. He now turns to enlightenment itself, which is his real body. The Buddha has already told us that when he was the ascetic Sumedha, he did not obtain any such dharma from Dipankara. It would be more accurate to say that at that meeting he lost all dharmas. For it was at that meeting that he gained an acceptance of the birthlessness of all dharmas. The Buddha now skips his intervening lifetimes and proceeds to Bodhgaya, where he reached the end of the bodhisattva path and realized enlightenment. While others might proclaim the wonders of such a world-shaking experience, the Buddha denies that he obtained or found anything at all. The teacher teaches no teaching because he learned nothing. And he learned nothing because the teaching contains no teaching. What the Buddha learned was like the jewel he himself placed in the ragged clothing of a poor traveler in the [Nirvana Sutra]{.italic}. Enlightenment turns out to be something the Buddha was never without. So how could he obtain it? Then, too, the hand cannot grasp itself, nor can the mind know itself.]{.calibre7}

One by one, the Buddha has divested Subhuti and his fellow disciples of any delusions or attachments they might have had concerning such a path. In the previous chapter, the Buddha put an end to the perception that buddhas teach anything. He now puts an end to the perception that buddhas realize anything. Of course, this begs the question asked by Bodhidharma, "You talk about non-realization. But how do you realize non-realization?"

But when Chu-ti heard what happened, he went into the kitchen and came out and asked the novice to show him again. When the novice stuck out his finger, Chu-ti whipped out a knife and cut it off. As the novice ran screaming out the door, Chu-ti yelled his name. When the novice stopped, Chu-ti asked him the meaning of enlightenment. Without thinking, the novice stuck out his fist.

[The absence of the four perceptions of a self, a being, a life, and a soul is what the Buddha means by "undifferentiated." If any of these attributes are present, a dharma is differentiated and is not undifferentiated. Undifferentiated means "devoid of attributes." The only attribute of such an undifferentiated dharma is no attribute. But because of its absence of attributes, it is the source of all auspicious dharmas by means of which all beings are able to enter the sanctuary of enlightenment.

And this will never end. But once you get free of the four perceptions and cultivate all auspicious dharmas, liberation is within reach. Those who cultivate all auspicious dharmas have no impure attachment to any dharma. They aren't moved or swayed by any situation. Nor do they desire, grasp, or love transcendent dharmas.

[IN CHAPTER THREE, the Buddha tells us that a bodhisattva sets forth on the path to enlightenment by resolving to liberate all beings but does so while remaining unattached to perceptions of a self, a being, a life or a soul. Here, the Buddha says that after having achieved the goal of enlightenment, a bodhisattva does not now become exempt from this dictum. Just as a bodhisattva liberates no beings, neither does a buddha rescue beings, for to do so would amount to belief in an entity and thus an attachment. But because neither the subject who is attached nor the object of attachment is real, every attachment is essentially no attachment. And yet people are attached. Thus, such people are called "foolish" because they do not see that their attachments are empty of any self-nature and therefore "no attachments." Still, even though they are foolish in clinging to what isn't real, they are but a thought away from buddhahood. Thus, buddhas rescue no one. Foolish people rescue foolish people.]{.calibre7}

[In Chapter Three, the Buddha tells Subhuti that those who set forth on the bodhisattva path resolve to [parinirvapya]{.italic} (liberate) all beings and to lead them into the [nirvanadhatu]{.italic} (realm of nirvana) but do so without being attached to such perceptions as self or being, which they are able to transcend or transform through the cultivation of wisdom. But traveling the bodhisattva path requires more than wisdom, and here the Buddha uses the word [parimocita]{.italic} (rescue) to emphasize the compassion of such resolve. The emphasis is not on liberation in the realm of nirvana but on rescue from the realm of sansara (birth-and-death). Another crucial difference is that previously the emphasis was on the point of view of a bodhisattva. Here, the point of view is that of a buddha.]{.calibre7}

[Sheng-yi says, "When a tathagata teaches a dharma, after beings hear the dharma, they enlighten themselves and liberate themselves. It isn't the Tathagata who can liberate beings. For example, a father can only tell his children to eat. His children have to eat by themselves. The father can't eat for them. The Tathagata realized the Dharma and became a buddha. And after he became a buddha, he taught dharmas to liberate beings. It isn't the Buddha who can liberate beings. If the Buddha could liberate beings, beings wouldn't have to cultivate. Beings are themselves tathagatas by nature. But because their nature has become concealed by the Five Skandhas, they are blind to it. But they are only blind, they haven't lost it. Beings can never lose their self-nature, and their self-nature can never leave beings. Fu Hsi said, 'Hold on to the buddha eye every night / get up every morning as usual / it follows you standing or sitting / speaking or silent it's there / never a hair's breadth away / just like the body's shadow / to find where buddhas dwell / it's right here in this sound.'

The first time was in Chapter Five, where he asked Subhuti his view of buddhahood as seen from the beginning of the bodhisattva path. The Buddha asked the same question again in Chapters Thirteen and Twenty where the view was that of someone who had taken up this teaching and was well along the path.

> [Following the Buddha's Nirvana, Buddhists have had to deal with the problem of the Buddha's apparent impermanence. Their solution, if it was not part of the Buddha's original teaching, was to view buddhas as possessing three bodies: a real body, or dharma-kaya, a reward body, or sanbhoga-kaya, and an apparition body, or nirmana-kaya. Briefly stated, when a noble son or daughter sets forth on the bodhisattva path, they plant the seed that results in buddhahood. When bodhisattvas become buddhas, they reap the fruit of their practice. Both the seed and the fruit are different aspects of a buddha's reward body, whose attributes are physical as well as spiritual, but are too perfect to be visible to the human eye. Having achieved enlightenment, buddhas manifest countless apparition bodies for use in the countless worlds where they teach and liberate others. These bodies are also physical and possess a set of visible attributes. But both the nirmana-kaya and the sanbhoga kaya are subject to creation and destruction, and are not real. They are not the body that the Buddha does not obtain and has never been without. Ultimately, however, these three bodies are one and the same, and the former two are seen as but manifestations of the latter, for the real body is not separate from anything, physical, psychological, or spiritual. Thus, when the Buddha asks Subhuti to consider his apparition body, such a body is still subject to impermanence and is not what distinguishes a buddha. What distinguishes a buddha is the dharma body. The dharma body is the body that fills the dharma realm. It is the body of reality. Thus, Subhuti can see the Buddha's apparition body, and over the course of this sutra he has begun to comprehend the immensity of the Buddha's reward body, but he still cannot see the Buddha's dharma body, just as a fish cannot see the whole ocean.]{.calibre7}

> [The Buddha usually uses gathas to summarize much longer sections of prose. Hence, the question presents itself, is this gatha meant to summarize this chapter or the whole sutra? Since this chapter is hardly long enough to require a gatha to summarize it, I suggest this gatha was meant to provide Subhuti with a synopsis of the entire sutra. Poems are much easier to memorize and hold in the mind, and this particular poem is the Buddha's answer to Subhuti concerning the observations that gave rise to his initial set of questions. Subhuti saw the Buddha going about his daily round, was awestruck by the Buddha's example, and wanted to know how he and others might follow in the Buddha's footsteps. But the source of the Buddha's example was not a set of moral proscriptions or meditative techniques but the perfection of wisdom. Hence, throughout this sutra, the Buddha has repeatedly come back to this question and comes back to it one last time. What is the nature of buddhahood? And why is it so important that we see the real buddha? Because the Buddha's real body is the same as our real body. Hence, the Buddha provides us with a simple poem to keep in mind while considering this question and our own answer to it. Where is the real buddha?]{.calibre7}

[ONCE AGAIN, the event that gave rise to this sutra was the Buddha's performance of his daily round: going to town to beg for food, returning to his dwelling place outside Shravasti, sitting down and focusing on what was before him. But who was it that did these things? And what do these activities have to do with buddhahood? In Chapter Five, the Buddha asked Subhuti if he could see the Tathagata by means of the set of attributes he had acquired. Despite Subhuti's denial to the contrary, the Buddha told him he could see the Tathagata, but only by means of the attributes the Tathagata had not acquired. Thus, the Tathagata cannot be seen by means of the possession of attributes, nor do such attributes have anything to do with buddhahood. They are merely the concomitants of practice. Hence, when the Buddha asks Subhuti if the possession of attributes has any bearing on the realization of enlightenment, he dismisses any causal connection before Subhuti has a chance to reply.]{.calibre7}

Essentially, Kumarajiva and those who have followed his interpretation see this first section as a warning against the view that merit is empty and thus has no relationship to buddhahood. And they see the second section as a warning against the view that dharmas are not already empty and thus must be eliminated.

[If the creation of dharmas (even such dharmas as a buddha's perfect attributes) is not related to enlightenment, what about their destruction? Do bodhisattvas not bring about an end to suffering and destroy the basis of future rebirths through their countless acts of merit? What about such dharmas as these? Here, too, the Buddha seeks to steer Subhuti away from any semblance of attachment. No dharma is championed as ensuring buddhahood, nor is any dharma seen as opposing it. Not only are the Buddha's own hard-won attributes not of any use, even the most distracting, erroneous conception is not an obstacle. For those who embark on the bodhisattva path realize that no dharma has ever come into being, will come into being, or now comes into being, which is what the Buddha refers to in the next chapter as "the forbearance of birthlessness." If no dharma has ever existed, will exist in the future, or now exists, then no dharma has been, ever will be, or is now destroyed or brought to an end. Still, as Asanga says, this does not deny the value of merit, as long as it is uncreated merit---the merit of the bodhisattva who vows to liberate all beings without liberating a single being.]{.calibre7}

Thus, in cultivating the seed of merit or in realizing the fruit of merit, the Mahayana not only remains unattached to attributes, it also does not base itself on the Hinayana view of their annihilation and destruction.

[THE BUDDHA HAS REPEATEDLY considered the merit produced by offerings of unimaginable value, even the sacrifice of one's own existence, and has compared such offerings to the merit produced by understanding and sharing this teaching with others. But his previous examples concerned the practice of learning and explaining as little as a single gatha of this sutra. The Buddha now approaches the heart of this teaching, as he goes beyond the sutra, itself, and beyond the mountain/no-mountain/mountain dialectic he has used thus far in trying to show the perfection of wisdom in action. He puts aside his prajna and dharma eyes and turns to his buddha eye (cf. Chapter Eighteen), as he brings us to the mother of buddhas, which cannot be approached as a perception but as an experience, the experience and acceptance of the selfless, birthless nature of all dharmas. Those bodhisattvas who have just embarked on the bodhisattva path are not capable of enduring such a trauma, only those at the end of it, which is why the Buddha has waited until now to reveal the essential teaching of the perfection of wisdom. Thus, the body of merit of which the Buddha now speaks is not the reward body, but the dharma body, the real body, which bodhisattvas obtain but obtain without grasping. For once bodhisattvas are able to bear the birthlessness of all dharmas, how can they be said to obtain anything other than the body they were never without, the body that does not begin to exist, cease to exist, or now exist.]{.calibre7}

[In this sutra, the Buddha focuses on three of the six perfections: the first perfection of charity, the third perfection of acceptance or forbearance, and the sixth perfection of wisdom. Here, the Buddha merges all three. For when we give something, we must be able to bear its loss and accept its absence. Thus, charity and acceptance are two aspects of the same practice. It is the perfection of wisdom, however, that transforms this twofold practice. For it is by means of wisdom that we realize that the elements of practice are empty, that there is no gift, no giver, no recipient, and thus no practice. Not only is there not now any practice, there never has been any practice, nor will there ever be any practice. And yet, instead of resulting in no merit, such realization results in obtaining a body of merit beyond the limits of conception, but a body of merit that is not obtained because such a body does not exist. For the hand cannot grasp itself. By realizing and accepting that all dharmas have no self, that they are not real, a bodhisattva gives up attachment to all created things. And only by giving up such pervasive, all-consuming attachment can a bodhisattva liberate all beings, beings who do not now exist, have never existed, and never will exist. In later, more developed descriptions of a bodhisattva's progress, such as that in the [Dashabhumika Sutra]{.italic}, the term [anutpattika-dharma-kshanti]{.italic} (acceptance of birthlessness) is said to characterize the eighth of the ten stages that culminate with buddhahood, and which is the subject of the next chapter.]{.calibre7}

[In this chapter, the Buddha finally addresses the true nature of the bodhisattva's body of merit. Previously, in Chapter Sixteen, the Buddha said bodhisattvas produce and obtain ([parigraha]{.italic}) a body of merit. But in Chapter Nineteen, he declared that the only reason he spoke of a body of merit was because there was no body of merit. In Chapters Sixteen and Nineteen, however, the body of merit of which he spoke was the result of karma and for that reason contained no self-nature. Here, the body of merit is not the result of karma. It is no body of merit because it is born of the realization that no body exists. This is our first glimpse of the dharma body as seen with the buddha eye.]{.calibre7}

[The non-attainment of this body, or the attainment of this nobody, begins and ends with a bodhisattva's resolution to liberate all beings. And such a resolution only works if it is free of perceptions of liberator, liberated, and liberation. Only such perceptionless resolve leads to the realization that all dharmas have no self, that all dharmas, whether they are beings, bodies, or buddhas, do not now exist, have never existed, nor will they ever exist. Thus, the bodhisattva's resolution turns out to be no resolution. And the body of merit produced by such a resolution turns out to be no body. It is this body---freed of all attachments, including the attachment to its own existence---which is the true body of every buddha. Such a body cannot be grasped, for there is no way to get one's hands or one's mind around it. It is this body that is the subject of the next chapter.]{.calibre7}

[FROM THE VERY BEGINNING of this sutra, the focus has been on the Buddha's body, and this sutra can be read as a meditation on the Buddha's body. But which body? It has sometimes seemed like the Buddha has been playing the old shell game with Subhuti: Now you see me, now you don't. Under which shell is the real buddha? As early as Chapter Five, the Buddha asked Subhuti if he could see his body, and with this koan he began Subhuti's education in the perfection of wisdom. Obviously, the Buddha was not referring to his physical body, which Subhuti knew was empty of any self-nature and merely an apparition. But to which body was the Buddha referring? And why did he refer to bodies at all? Subhuti was known for his attachment to emptiness, hence the Buddha sought to lead him beyond emptiness by considering his reward body, which is a reflection of a buddha's selflessness. The Buddha also urged Subhuti to cultivate his own reward body, which he called his "body of merit," by resolving to liberate all beings without attachment to any being or to any self. However, while selflessness is the necessary cause of such bodies, selflessness itself turns out to be birthless. No self has ever existed. Hence, one cannot transcend what doesn't exist. Thus, the buddha's reward body and the bodhisattva's body of merit turn out to be no bodies, no bodies that arise from this teaching. If we wish to follow in the Buddha's footsteps, we need to find the Buddha's real body, his uncreated, indestructible body, his diamond body. In this chapter, the Buddha finally lifts the shell.]{.calibre7}

Reading [tatha-agata]{.italic}, we have "thus come," where "thus" refers to what Buddhists call "suchness" and "come" refers to the Buddha's apparition body and his appearance among mankind. Since the Chinese prefer to emphasize the Buddha's compassion, they invariably translate [tathagata]{.italic} as [ju-lai]{.italic} (thus come). Here, however, such a translation would be a mistake. The Buddha does not come. Reading [tatha-gata]{.italic}, the word also means "thus go" and emphasizes the Buddha's transcendence of his physical body and full realization of his reward body. But neither does the Buddha go. For if all dharmas are selfless and birthless, can anything be said to truly come or go? As the sutra nears its end, the Buddha finally tells Subhuti he was mistaken if he thought anything took place at all in the great city of Shravasti or in Anathapindada Garden, and he was also mistaken to think he could follow in the Buddha's footsteps, when, in fact, there are no footsteps.]{.calibre7}

In the same way, the self is empty, the world is empty, the sky is empty, mountains and rivers and the whole earth are empty, 'nowhere' is also empty.

But because we are attached to entities that do not really exist, the Buddha asks us to examine and discover the true nature of these entities and to free ourselves of our attachment to them. Ever since Chapter Four, the Buddha has been trying to put to rest this omnipresent belief at the core of our delusions, this belief in an entity, in something separate in time or space or mind. All of these entities are entities that our self could not manage to incorporate and the existence of which it has reluctantly had to admit. And yet none of them is real.

[NOTHING IS REAL. From the Buddha's begging-bowl universe, we come back to the belief that prevents a true perception of a ball of rice or anything else: the belief in the existence of a self, from which our beliefs in a being, a life, and a soul are derived as well as our belief in dharmas. The Buddha tells us that to understand the true nature of any entity, whether that entity is a self, a dharma, or even a buddha, we must not be blinded by our own perception of it. It is not the myriad atoms of dust or the billion-world universe that prevents us from attaining enlightenment but our mistaken views of such things as separate or permanent, as somehow real. But on closer examination, these entities turn out to be rather arbitrary views of reality founded on nothing more than linguistic conventions, which are themselves the detritus of previously established arbitrary views. And all of these views can be traced back to our view of the self. Thus, the Buddha returns to the view that began this sutra: setting forth on our daily round with an empty bowl and bestowing this teaching on those we meet.]{.calibre7}

[This concludes Subhuti's education in the perfection of wisdom, which he learned so well he became the Buddha's representative in teaching the paramita of prajna to the gods and his fellow shravakas in the other sutras that make up the perfection of wisdom scriptures. The teaching itself is quite simple. But we are very complex beings and easily misunderstand simple things. To free us from the views that bind us to the Wheel of Rebirth, the Buddha teaches dharmas, which are themselves views, and like all views, are empty at heart. But dharmas are views that counteract the views that rule our lives and that ensure our rebirth for countless more lives. For someone suffering from anger, the Buddha teaches compassion. For someone suffering from desire, he teaches morality. And for someone suffering from delusion, he teaches wisdom. No medication works for every individual or for every illness. There is no perfect medicine. Nor would a doctor want patients taking medication after their illness has been cured. Thus, the Buddha's dharmas are no dharmas. For all dharmas are not only selfless, they are birthless.]{.calibre7}

Next, we cling to the appearance of enlightenment, which the Buddha breaks through with 'no attainment.' Next, we cling to the appearance of practicing charity to purify a buddha land, which the Buddha breaks through with 'no land to purify.' Next, we cling to the appearance of a reward body produced by merit, which the Buddha breaks through with 'a physical body of no attributes.' Next, we once more cling to the appearance of the three bodies of the Tathagata, which the Buddha breaks through by saying that the apparition body is not real and the reward body is free of appearances. Next, we cling to the appearance of a dharma body, which the Buddha breaks through by saying that the dharma body has no appearance.

[At the beginning of this sutra, Subhuti asked the Buddha how bodhisattvas should stand, how they should walk, and how they should control their thoughts. The Buddha now concludes that bodhisattvas should stand on what they know, which is the selflessness and birthlessness of all dharmas, they should walk on what they see, which is the dharma body of reality, and they should control their thoughts by believing this teaching of the perfection of wisdom. Except for "believe," the Buddha uses the same language here that he uses in Chapter Fourteen and elsewhere. Just as buddhas [jnata]{.italic} (know) those who practice this teaching by means of their buddha-knowledge, those who practice it [jnata]{.italic} (know) all dharmas. Just as buddhas [drista]{.italic} (see) those who practice this teaching by means of their buddha-vision, those who practice it [drista]{.italic} (see) all dharmas. Thus, buddhas [buddha]{.italic} (are aware) of those who [adhimokta]{.italic} (believe) this teaching. But those who believe this teaching do so without attachment to any dharma. Once again, the image of a raft comes to mind. After crossing the river, if we continue to carry a dharma around, we only increase our suffering, instead of freeing ourselves from it. Thus, dharmas are dharmas, but they are also no dharmas. They are empty of any nature of their own, and if we remain attached to any aspect of them, they prevent rather than aid our liberation and the liberation of others. The biggest of all dharmas is buddhahood. But buddhahood is also another name for the biggest self of all. The focus of this sutra has been the attainment of buddhahood, but it has also been the practice of prajna by means of which we reach that goal while at the same time remaining unattached to it. Once across the river, we must leave the raft behind. The perfection of wisdom teaches us to know rafts, to see rafts, and to trust rafts, but it also teaches us to leave them behind. Thus do bodhisattvas know, see, and trust all dharmas.]{.calibre7}

The Buddha then told Subhuti they must cultivate both wisdom and compassion by liberating all beings while remaining unattached to any perception of a being, any perception of a self, or any perception of liberation. In this final chapter, the Buddha sums up this teaching that combines wisdom and compassion: not only is it grasped without grasping, it is explained without explaining. Whoever explains this teaching like this does what a buddha does. This is why the Buddha gets up in the morning and goes to town.

[The Buddha returns to the comparison he has made throughout this sutra, whereby an offering of the most valuable objects in the world is compared to an offering of a single poem that expresses the truth. As the extent and value of material offerings have steadily increased, the fearless bodhisattva has been presented as the most likely member of the Buddha's audience to understand the greater value of a good poem. How ironic that at the end of this sutra, the merit of a fearless bodhisattva fails to compare to that of an ordinary person. For even a fearless bodhisattva can become attached to the net of jewels of an illusory world. But the message the Buddha wants to leave with his audience is that the body of merit synonymous with the Buddha's own diamond body is accessible to anyone, that such a body is a four-line gatha away.]{.calibre7}

[Most commentators and at least two translators interpret this gatha as an example of how this sutra should be explained. Müller, for example, places it before "thus is it called 'explaining.'" And Kumarajiva prefaces it with "and how so?" to connect the gatha with "thus is it called 'explaining.'" But no other edition, Chinese or Sanskrit, follows suit. This gatha, I suggest, is not meant as an example of explaining this teaching, for the Buddha has just noted that the bodhisattva's explanation is no explanation. This gatha is simply an offering given to us by the Buddha, the Buddha's way of saying goodbye: "Until we meet again, here is something for your empty bowl: regard all things, all beings, this teaching, this sutra, this body of merit, this realization, regard them all as unreal."]{.calibre7}

Also, while this gatha provides a summary of the teaching regarding the empty and illusory nature of begging in the city, which is the subject of the [Perfection of Wisdom in Five Hundred Lines,]{.italic} clearly it does not summarize the teaching of this sutra. If any single gatha "explains" this sutra, a better choice would be the gatha in Chapter Twenty-six. This gatha is simply "goodbye."]{.calibre7}

A cataract presents images of flowers and other objects that turn out to be defects of vision. A star in the sky appears at dusk only to disappear at dawn. An illusion is nothing but a conjurer's trick. A dewdrop seems such a perfect jewel but vanishes as soon as the sun appears. A bubble turns out to contain nothing. A dream enthralls us in its scenes, until we wake and wonder where it came from and where it went. A cloud forms out of thin air, never stops changing shape, and vanishes into nothing.
