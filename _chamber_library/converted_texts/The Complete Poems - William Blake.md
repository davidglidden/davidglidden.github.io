WILLIAM BLAKE:  
THE COMPLETE POEMS



WILLIAM BLAKE was born in Broad Street in 1757, the son of a London hosier. Having attended Henry Parr’s drawing school in the Strand, he was in 1772 apprenticed to Henry Basire, engraver to the Society of Antiquaries, and later was admitted as a student to the Royal Academy, where he exhibited in 1780. He married Catherine Boucher in 1782 and in 1783 published *Poetical Sketches*. The first of his ‘illuminated books’ was *Songs of Innocence* \(1789\), which, like *The Book of Thel* \(published in the same year\), has as its main themes the celebration of innocence and its inviolability.



Blake sets out his ideas more fully in his chief prose work, *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell* \(1791\), which proclaims his lifelong belief in the moral primacy of the imagination. But in *Songs of Experience* \(1794\) he recognizes the power of repression, and in a series of short narrative poems he looks for mankind’s redemption from oppression through a resurgence of imaginative life. By 1797 he was ready for epic; *Vala* was never finished, but in *Milton* and *Jerusalem* he presents his renewed vision of reconciliation among the warring fragments of humanity. Other striking poems of his middle years are the lyrics of the Pickering Manuscript, and *The Everlasting Gospel*, but in the last years of his life he expressed himself in drawing rather than poetry.



Little of Blake’s work was published on conventional form. He combined his vocations as poet and graphic artist to produce books that are visually stunning. He also designed illustrations of works by other poets and devised his own technique for producing large watercolour illustrations and colour-printed drawings. Blake died in 1827, ‘an Old Man feeble & tottering but not in Spirit & Life not in the Real Man The Imagination which Liveth for Ever’.

## ***********Preface***



William Blake is the rebel *par excellence* of English poetry, who sets his face against convention and restriction of every sort, glorifies untrammelled inspiration and defends the artist’s liberty, in matters of literary format as well as in his religious, political and social ideas. Almost none of his work was published in conventional printed form. Pursuing his vocations as poet and graphic artist simultaneously, he printed most of it himself, with text \(in his own orthography\) and illustrations commonly intertwined, by a method of etching he invented for the purpose. Copies of individual works often vary, not only in the character of the water-colour timings he gave them, but also in the order of the plates and in words or lines which appear in some copies but are deleted in others. Blake’s spelling, punctuation and grammar obey his individual temperament. Many of his poems, including some major ones, exist only in much-revised manuscript form.

No conventionally type-set edition of Blake’s poetry can compete, either in beauty or in clarity, with the original illuminated books produced by the poet; neither can it suggest the full complexity of the texts in manuscript. Given these limitations, however, the intention of this edition is to reproduce the work with as much fidelity as possible to the forms in which he wrote it. ‘Improvement makes strait roads; but the crooked roads without Improvement are roads of Genius,’ Blake remarked. Intrigued readers may be lured onward to the originals, or to the many excellent facsimile editions of them which fortunately exist today.

*Spelling, grammar, punctuation*. Most readers will not be troubled by Blake’s often archaic or eccentric spelling, his frequent use of capitalization for emphasis, his predilection for the rapid ‘&’ as opposed to the conventional ‘and’, and his sometimes crude grammar. These peculiarities have usually been accepted by Blake’s editors and readers alike as quirky but charming. A greater stumbling-block is Blake’s punctuation, which is at all times idiosyncratic, and at some times, particularly in the manuscript poems, virtually non-existent. Most standard editions of Blake have supplied a conventional punctuation, but to alter in this matter is clearly to distort. I have therefore followed the procedure of David V. Erdman in *The Poetry and Prose of William Blake*, retaining the poet’s punctuation and non-punctuation intact. As a rule, any punctuation mark may be taken simply as a sign for a greater or lesser *pause* in the flow of language, rather than as an indicator of grammatical relationships. With a little relaxation and practice, the reader will find that this is less difficult than it appears at first, and finally that it may create a sense of freedom and buoyancy, and an openness of syntactic construction, which bring considerable aesthetic and intellectual pleasure.

*Revisions*. In the presentation of textual variations, emendations, revisions, etc., a distinction is made between Blake’s manuscript poems and his finished work. For poems which Blake published \(or had published or printed for him\) in any form, and which we may thus suppose to be finished, the relatively few variations which exist are presented in the Notes. For poems which exist only in manuscript form, this material is incorporated in the text through italics and brackets, reproducing as far as possible the condition of the texts in their ‘workshop’ state, with successive stages of revision evident as one reads along. The assumption here is that unfinished poems should not be presented to the eye as if they were finished, and vice versa; and that the reader will benefit from an opportunity to sense Blake’s verse both as working process and as completed product. In this respect, the innovative and successful procedure of Geoffrey Keynes’s Nonesuch and Oxford editions of the *Complete Writings* is followed with gratitude.

*Texts*. The texts on which the present edition is based are those of David V. Erdman, *The Poetry and Prose of William Blake*, Doubleday, 1970. This volume should be consulted for complete detail in regard to Blake’s revisions, and for full discussion of textual complexities. There are some changes, particularly in punctuation. The marks ‘\!’, ‘?’, ‘:’ and ‘;’ are often difficult to distinguish in Blake’s calligraphy. Erdman commonly transcribes ‘\!’ where I find a colon or semi-colon. Blake’s full stops and commas are also difficult to tell apart, and he is rather skimpy about the latter. Thus in works where both ‘.’ and ‘,’ appear, they are retained \(but the readings sometimes disagree with Erdman’s\). In works where ‘.’ alone appears, and is evidently doing service for both conventional ‘.’ and conventional ‘,’ in the original, the present text follows what normal grammar and syntax would require. Another change is that Night VII \[b\] of *The Four Zoas*, which Erdman believes was ‘supplanted by VII \[a\]’, is here placed within the text rather than as an appendix, following the argument made by several scholars that Blake never definitively rejected this portion of the manuscript. A final alteration is that the *Songs of Experience*, which Blake printed in 1794, are here placed just after the *Songs of Innocence* \(1789\), for the reader’s convenience.

*Notes and Dictionary of Proper Names*. The Notes attempt to clarify what is difficult in Blake’s poetry, and to indicate where passages from the Bible, Milton and other sources seem necessary to explain a text or enrich our understanding of its implications. The Dictionary of Proper Names defines recurrent terms in Blake’s symbolic systems.

To express my gratitude to the multitude of Blake scholars who have shaped my comprehension of his poetry would be impossible. I have at each step walked particularly in the tracks of Geoffrey Keynes, David Erdman, G. E. Bentley, Jr, S. Foster Damon, Northrop Frye, Harold Bloom and W. H. Stevenson, and have gained knowledge and insight from many other commentators. I owe special thanks to Professor Erdman for assistance with texts and guidance through the labyrinths of the Notebook; to Morton Paley for advice on *Jerusalem*; and to James McGowan for the use of unpublished research on *Poetical Sketches*.

**********POETICAL SKETCHES



### *******Miscellaneous Poems***

TO SPRING

O thou, with dewy locks, who lookest down  
Thro’ the clear windows of the morning; turn  
Thine angel eyes upon our western isle,  
Which in full choir hails thy approach, O Spring\!

The hills tell each other, and the list’ning  
Vallies hear; all our longing eyes are turned  
Up to thy bright pavillions: issue forth,  
And let thy holy feet visit our clime.  

Come o’er the eastern hills, and let our winds

10     Kiss thy perfumed garments; let us taste

Thy morn and evening breath; scatter thy pearls  
Upon our love-sick land that mourns for thee.

O deck her forth with thy fair fingers; pour  
Thy soft kisses on her bosom; and put  
Thy golden crown upon her languish’d head,  
Whose modest tresses were bound up for thee\!

TO SUMMER

O thou, who passest thro’ our vallies in  
Thy strength, curb thy fierce steeds, allay the heat  
That flames from their large nostrils\! thou, O Summer,  
Oft pitched’st here thy golden tent, and oft  
Beneath our oaks hast slept, while we beheld  
With joy, thy ruddy limbs and flourishing hair.

Beneath our thickest shades we oft have heard  
Thy voice, when noon upon his fervid car  
Rode o’er the deep of heaven; beside our springs

10     Sit down, and in our mossy vallies, on

Some bank beside a river clear, throw thy  
Silk draperies off, and rush into the stream:  
Our vallies love the Summer in his pride.

Our bards are fam’d who strike the silver wire:  
Our youth are bolder than the southern swains:  
Our maidens fairer in the sprightly dance:  
We lack not songs, nor instruments of joy,  
Nor echoes sweet, nor waters clear as heaven,  
Nor laurel wreaths against the sultry heat.

TO AUTUMN

O Autumn, laden with fruit, and stained  
With the blood of the grape, pass not, but sit  
Beneath my shady roof, there thou may’st rest,  
And tune thy jolly voice to my fresh pipe;  
And all the daughters of the year shall dance\!  
Sing now the lusty song of fruits and flowers.

‘The narrow bud opens her beauties to  
‘The sun, and love runs in her thrilling veins;  
‘Blossoms hang round the brows of morning, and

10   ‘Flourish down the bright cheek of modest eve,

‘Till clust’ring Summer breaks forth into singing,  
‘And feather’d clouds strew flowers round her head.

‘The spirits of the air live on the smells  
‘Of frait; and joy, with pinions light, roves round  
‘The gardens, or sits singing in the trees.’  
Thus sang the jolly Autumn as he sat,  
Then rose, girded himself, and o’er the bleak  
Hills fled from our sight; but left his golden load.

TO WINTER

O Winter\! bar thine adamantine doors:  
The north is thine; there hast thou built thy dark  
Deep-founded habitation. Shake not thy roofs,  
Nor bend thy pillars with thine iron car.

He hears me not, but o’er the yawning deep  
Rides heavy; his storms are unchain’d; sheathed  
In ribbed steel, I dare not lift mine eyes;  
For he hath rear’d his sceptre o’er the world.

Lo\! now the direful monster, whose skin clings

10   To his strong bones, strides o’er the groaning rocks:

He withers all in silence, and his hand  
Unclothes the earth, and freezes up frail life.

He takes his seat upon the cliffs, the mariner  
Cries in vain. Poor little wretch\! that deal’st  
With storms; till heaven smiles, and the monster  
Is driv’n yelling to his caves beneath mount Hecla.

TO THE EVENING STAR

Thou fair-hair’d angel of the evening,  
Now, while the sun rests on the mountains, light  
Thy bright torch of love; thy radiant crown  
Put on, and smile upon our evening bed\!  
Smile on our loves; and, while thou drawest the  
Blue curtains of the sky, scatter thy silver dew  
On every flower that shuts its sweet eyes  
In timely sleep. Let thy west wind sleep on  
The lake; speak si\[l\]ence with thy glimmering eyes,

10   And wash the dusk with silver. Soon, full soon,

Dost thou withdraw; then the wolf rages wide,  
And the lion glares thro’ the dun forest:  
The fleeces of our flocks are cover’d with  
Thy sacred dew: protect them with thine influence.

TO MORNING

O holy virgin\! clad in purest white,  
Unlock heav’n’s golden gates, and issue forth;  
Awake the dawn that sleeps in heaven; let light  
Rise from the chambers of the east, and bring  
The honied dew that cometh on waking day.  
O radiant morning, salute the sun,  
Rouz’d like a huntsman to the chace; and, with  
Thy buskin’d feet, appear upon our hills.

FAIR ELENOR

The bell struck one, and shook the silent tower;  
The graves give up their dead: fair Elenor  
Walk’d by the castle gate, and looked in.  
A hollow groan ran thro’ the dreary vaults.

She shriek’d aloud, and sunk upon the steps  
On the cold stone her pale cheek. Sickly smells  
Of death, issue as from a sepulchre,  
And all is silent but the sighing vaults.

Chill death withdraws his hand, and she revives;

10   Amaz’d, she finds herself upon her feet,

And, like a ghost, thro’ narrow passages  
Walking, feeling the cold walls with her hands.

Fancy returns, and now she thinks of bones,  
And grinning skulls, and corruptible death,  
Wrap’d in his shroud; and now, fancies she hears  
Deep sighs, and sees pale sickly ghosts gliding.

At length, no fancy, but reality  
Distracts her. A rushing sound, and the feet  
Of one that fled, approaches – Ellen stood,

20   Like a dumb statue, froze to stone with fear.

The wretch approaches, crying, ‘The deed is done;  
‘Take this, and send it by whom thou wilt send;  
‘It is my life – send it to Elenor: –  
‘He’s dead, and howling after me for blood\!

‘Take this,’ he cry’d; and thrust into her arms  
A wet napkin, wrap’d about; then rush’d  
Past, howling: she receiv’d into her arms  
Pale death, and follow’d on the wings of fear.

They pass’d swift thro’ the outer gate; the wretch,

30   Howling, leap’d o’er the wall into the moat,

Stifling in mud. Fair Ellen pass’d the bridge,  
And heard a gloomy voice cry, ‘Is it done?’

As the deer wounded Ellen flew over  
The pathless plain; as the arrows that fly  
By night; destruction flies, and strikes in darkness,  
She fled from fear, till at her house arriv’d.

Her maids await her; on her bed she falls,  
That bed of joy, where erst her lord hath press’d:  
‘Ah, woman’s fear\!’ she cry’d; ‘Ah, cursed duke\!

40   ‘Ah, my dear lord\! ah, wretched Elenor\!

‘My lord was like a flower upon the brows  
‘Of lusty May\! Ah, life as frail as flower\!  
‘O ghastly death\! withdraw thy cruel hand,  
‘Seek’st thou that flow’r to deck thy horrid temples?

‘My lord was like a star, in highest heav’n  
‘Drawn down to earth by spells and wickedness:  
‘My lord was like the opening eyes of day,  
‘When western winds creep softly o’er the flowers:

‘But he is darken’d; like the summer’s noon,

50   ‘Clouded; fall’n like the stately tree, cut down;

‘The breath of heaven dwelt among his leaves.  
‘O Elenor, weak woman, fill’d with woe\!’

Thus having spoke, she raised up her head,  
And saw the bloody napkin by her side,  
Which in her arms she brought; and now, tenfold  
More terrified, saw it unfold itself.

Her eyes were fix’d; the bloody cloth unfolds,  
Disclosing to her sight the murder’d head  
Of her dear lord, all ghastly pale, clotted

60   With gory blood; it groan’d, and thus it spake:

‘O Elenor, behold thy husband’s head,  
‘Who, sleeping on the stones of yonder tower  
‘Was ’reft of life by the accursed duke\!  
‘A hired villain turn’d my sleep to death\!

‘O Elenor, beware the cursed duke,  
‘O give not him thy hand, now I am dead;  
‘He seeks thy love; who, coward, in the night,  
‘Hired a villain to bereave my life.’

She sat with dead cold limbs, stiffen’d to stone;

70   She took the gory head up in her arms;

She kiss’d the pale lips; she had no tears to shed;  
She hugg’d it to her breast, and groan’d her last.

SONG

How sweet I roam’d from field to field,

And tasted all the summer’s pride,

’Till I the prince of love beheld,

Who in the sunny beams did glide\!

He shew’d me lilies for my hair,

And blushing roses for my brow;

He led me through his gardens fair,

Where all his golden pleasures grow.

With sweet May dews my wings were wet,

10        And Phoebus fir’d my vocal rage;

He caught me in his silken net,

And shut me in his golden cage.

He loves to sit and hear me sing,

Then, laughing, sports and plays with me;

Then stretches out my golden wing,

And mocks my loss of liberty.

 



SONG

My silks and fine array,

My smiles and languish’d air,

By love are driv’n away;

And mournful lean Despair

Brings me yew to deck my grave:

Such end true lovers have.

His face is fair as heav’n,

When springing buds unfold;

O why to him was’t giv’n,

10        Whose heart is wintry cold?

His breast is love’s all worship’d tomb,

Where all love’s pilgrims come.

Bring me an axe and spade,

Bring me a winding sheet;

When I my grave have made,

Let winds and tempests beat:

Then down I’ll lie, as cold as clay.

True love doth pass away\!



SONG

Love and harmony combine,  
And around our souls intwine,  
While thy branches mix with mine,  
And our roots together join.

Joys upon our branches sit,  
Chirping loud, and singing sweet;  
Like gentle streams beneath our feet  
Innocence and virtue meet.

Thou the golden fruit dost bear,

10   I am clad in flowers fair;

Thy sweet boughs perfume the air,  
And the turtle buildeth there.

There she sits and feeds her young,  
Sweet I hear her mournful song;  
And thy lovely leaves among,  
There is love: I hear his tongue.

There his charming nest doth lay,  
There he sleeps the night away;  
There he sports along the day,

20   And doth among our branches play.

SONG

I love the jocund dance,

The softly-breathing song,

Where innocent eyes do glance,

And where lisps the maiden’s tongue.

I love the laughing vale,

I love the echoing hill,

Where mirth does never fail,

And the jolly swain laughs his fill.

I love the pleasant cot,

I love the innocent bow’r.

10   Where white and brown is our lot,

Or fruit in the mid-day hour.

I love the oaken seat,

Beneath the oaken tree,

Where all the old villagers meet,

And laugh our sports to see.

I love our neighbours all,

But, Kitty, I better love thee;

And love them I ever shall;

20      But thou art all to me.

SONG

Memory, hither come,

And tune your merry notes;

And, while upon the wind,

Your music floats,

I’ll pore upon the stream,

Where sighing lovers dream,

And fish for fancies as they pass

Within the watery glass.

I’ll drink of the clear stream,

10      And hear the linnet’s song;

And there I’ll lie and dream

The day along:

And, when night comes, I’ll go

To places fit for woe;

Walking along the darken’d valley,

With silent Melancholy.

MAD SONG

The wild winds weep,

And the night is a-cold;

Come hither, Sleep,

And my griefs infold:

But lo\! the morning peeps

Over the eastern steeps,

And the rustling birds of dawn

The earth do scorn.

Lo\! to the vault

10      Of paved heaven,

With sorrow fraught

My notes are driven:

They strike the ear of night,

Make weep the eyes of day;

They make mad the roaring winds,

And with tempests play.

Like a fiend in a cloud

With howling woe,

After night I do croud,

And with night will go;

20   I turn my back to the east,

From whence comforts have increas’d;  
For light doth seize my brain  
With frantic pain.

SONG

Fresh from the dewy hill, the merry year  
Smiles on my head, and mounts his flaming car;  
Round my young brows the laurel wreathes a shade,  
And rising glories beam around my head.

My feet are wing’d, while o’er the dewy lawn,  
I meet my maiden, risen like the morn:  
Oh bless those holy feet, like angels’ feet;  
Oh bless those limbs, beaming with heav’nly light\!

Like as an angel glitt’ring in the sky,

10   In times of innocence, and holy joy;

The joyful shepherd stops his grateful song,  
To hear the music of an angel’s tongue.

So when she speaks, the voice of Heaven I hear  
So when we walk, nothing impure comes near;  
Each field seems Eden, and each calm retreat;  
Each village seems the haunt of holy feet.

But that sweet village where my black-ey’d maid,  
Closes her eyes in sleep beneath night’s shade:

Whene’er I enter, more than mortal fire

20    Burns in my soul, and does my song inspire.

SONG

When early morn walks forth in sober grey;  
Then to my black ey’d maid I haste away,  
When evening sits beneath her dusky bow’r,  


And gently sighs away the silent hour;  
The village bell alarms, away I go;  
And the vale darkens at my pensive woe.

To that sweet village, where my black ey’d maid  
Doth drop a tear beneath the silent shade,  
I turn my eyes; and, pensive as I go,

10   Curse my black stars, and bless my pleasing woe.

Oft when the summer sleeps among the trees,  
Whisp’ring faint murmurs to the scanty breeze,  
I walk the village round; if at her side  
A youth doth walk in stolen joy and pride,  
I curse my stars in bitter grief and woe,  
That made my love so high, and me so low.

O should she e’er prove false, his limbs I’d tear,  
And throw all pity on the burning air;  
I’d curse bright fortune for my mixed lot,

20   And then I’d die in peace, and be forgot.

TO THE MUSES

Whether on Ida’s shady brow,

Or in the chambers of the East,

The chambers of the sun, that now

From antient melody have ceas’d;

Whether in Heav’n ye wander fair,

Or the green corners of the earth,

Or the blue regions of the air,

Where the melodious winds have birth;

Whether on chrystal rocks ye rove,

10        Beneath the bosom of the sea

Wand’ring in many a coral grove,

Fair Nine, forsaking Poetry\!

How have you left the antient love

That bards of old enjoy’d in you\!

The languid strings do scarcely move\!

The sound is forc’d, the notes are few\!

GWIN, KING OF NORWAY

Come, Kings, and listen to my song,

When Gwin, the son of Nore,

Over the nations of the North

His cruel sceptre bore:

The Nobles of the land did feed

Upon the hungry Poor;

They tear the poor man’s lamb, and drive

The needy from their door\!

The land is desolate; our wives

10      And children cry for bread;

Arise, and pull the tyrant down;

Let Gwin be humbled.

Gordred the giant rous’d himself

From sleeping in his cave;

He shook the hills, and in the clouds

The troubl’d banners wave.

Beneath them roll’d, like tempests black,

The num’rous sons of blood;

Like lions’ whelps, roaring abroad,

20      Seeking their nightly food.

Down Bleron’s hills they dreadful rush,

Their cry ascends the clouds;

The trampling horse, and clanging arms

Like rushing mighty floods\!

Their wives and children, weeping loud,

Follow in wild array,

Howling like ghosts, furious as wolves

In the bleak wintry day.

‘Pull down the tyrant to the dust,

30        ‘Let Gwin be humbled,’

They cry; ‘and let ten thousand lives

‘Pay for the tyrant’s head.’

From tow’r to tow’r the watchmen cry,

‘O Gwin, the son of Nore,

‘Arouse thyself\! the nations black,

‘Like clouds, come rolling o’er\!’

Gwin rear’d his shield, his palace shakes,

His chiefs come rushing round;

Each, like an awful thunder cloud,

40      With voice of solemn sound.

Like reared stones around a grave

They stand around the King;

Then suddenly each seiz’d his spear,

And clashing steel does ring.

The husbandman does leave his plow,

To wade thro’ fields of gore;

The merchant binds his brows in steel,

And leaves the trading shore:

The shepherd leaves his mellow pipe,

50       And sounds the trumpet shrill;

The workman throws his hammer down

To heave the bloody bill.

Like the tall ghost of Barraton,

Who sports in stormy sky,

Gwin leads his host as black as night,

When pestilence does fly.

With horses and with chariots –

And all his spearmen bold,

March to the sound of mournful song,

60       Like clouds around him roll’d.

Gwin lifts his hand – the nations halt;

‘Prepare for war,’ he cries –

Gordred appears\! – his frowning brow

Troubles our northern skies.

The armies stand, like balances

Held in th’ Almighty’s hand; –

‘Gwin, thou hast fill’d thy measure up,

‘Thou’rt swept from out the land.’

And now the raging armies rush’d,

70       Like warring mighty seas;

The Heav’ns are shook with roaring war,

The dust ascends the skies\!

Earth smokes with blood, and groans, and shakes,

To drink her children’s gore,

A sea of blood; nor can the eye

See to the trembling shore\!

And on the verge of this wild sea

Famine and death doth cry;

The cries of women and of babes.

80      Over the field doth fly.

The King is seen raging afar;

With all his men of might;

Like blazing comets, scattering death

Thro’ the red fev’rous night.

Beneath his arm like sheep they die,

And groan upon the plain;

The battle faints, and bloody men

Fight upon hills of slain.

Now death is sick, and riven men

90       Labour and toil for life;

Steed rolls on steed, and shield on shield,

Sunk in this sea of strife\!

The god of war is drunk with blood,

The earth doth faint and fail;

The stench of blood makes sick the heav’ns;

Ghosts glut the throat of hell\!

O what have Kings to answer for,

Before that awful throne\!

When thousand deaths for vengeance cry,

100     And ghosts accusing groan\!

Like blazing comets in the sky,

That shake the stars of light,

Which drop like fruit unto the earth,

Thro’ the fierce burning night;

Like these did Gwin and Gordred meet,

And the first blow decides;

Down from the brow unto the breast

Gordred his head divides\!

Gwin fell; the Sons of Norway fled,

110      All that remain’d alive;

The rest did fill the vale of death,

For them the eagles strive.

The river Dorman roll’d their blood

Into the northern sea;

Who mourn’d his sons, and overwhelm’d

The pleasant south country.

AN IMITATION OF SPEN\[S\]ER

Golden Apollo, that thro’ heaven wide

Scatter’st the rays of light, and truth’s beams\!

In lucent words my darkling verses dight,

And wash my earthy mind in thy clear streams,

That wisdom may descend in fairy dreams:

All while the jocund hours in thy train

Scatter their fancies at thy poet’s feet;

And when thou yields to night thy wide domain,

Let rays of truth enlight his sleeping brain.

10  For brutish Pan in vain might thee assay

With tinkling sounds to dash thy nervous verse,

Sound without sense; yet in his rude affray,

\(For ignorance is Folly’s Ieesing nurse,  
And love of Folly needs none other curse;\)

Midas the praise hath gain’d of lengthen’d eares,

For which himself might deem him ne’er the worse

To sit in council with his modern peers,

And judge of tinkling rhimes, and elegances terse.

And thou, Mercurius, that with winged brow

20        Dost mount aloft into the yielding sky,

And thro’ Heav’n’s halls thy airy flight dost throw,

Entering with holy feet to where on high

Jove weighs the counsel of futurity;

Then, laden with eternal fate, dost go

Down, like a falling star, from autumn sky,

And o’er the surface of the silent deep dost fly.

 

If thou arrivest at the sandy shore,

Where nought but envious hissing adders dwell,

Thy golden rod, thrown on the dusty floor,

30 Can charm to harmony with potent spell;

Such is sweet Eloquence, that does dispel

Envy and Hate, that thirst for human gore:

And cause in sweet society to dwell

Vile savage minds that lurk in lonely cell.

 

O Mercury, assist my lab’ring sense,

That round the circle of the world wou’d fly\!

As the wing’d eagle scorns the tow’ry fence

Of Alpine hills round his high aery,

And searches thro’ the corners of the sky,

40      Sports in the clouds to hear the thunder’s sound,

And see the winged lightnings as they fly,

Then, bosom’d in an amber cloud, around

Plumes his wide wings, and seeks Sol’s palace high.

 

And thou, O warrior maid, invincible,

Arm’d with the terrors of Almighty Jove\!

Pallas, Minerva, maiden terrible,

Lov’st thou to walk the peaceful solemn grove,

In solemn gloom of branches interwove?

Or bear’st thy Egis o’er the burning field,

50      Where, like the sea, the waves of battle move?

Or have thy soft piteous eyes beheld

The weary wanderer thro’ the desert rove?

Or does th’ afflicted man thy heav’nly bosom move?



BLIND-MAN’S BUFF

When silver Snow decks Susan’s cloaths,  
And jewel hangs at th’ shepherd’s nose,  
The blushing bank is all my care,  
With hearth so red, and walls so fair;  
‘Heap the sea-coal; come, heap it higher,  
‘The oaken log lay on the fire:’  
The well-wash’d stools, a circling row,  
With lad and lass, how fair the show\!  
The merry can of nut-brown ale,

10   The laughing jest, the love-sick tale,

’Till tir’d of chat, the game begins,  
The lasses prick the lads with pins;  
Roger from Dolly twitch’d the stool,  
She falling, kiss’d the ground, poor fool\!  
She blush’d so red, with side-long glance  
At hob-nail Dick, who griev’d the chance.  
But now for Blind-man’s Buff they call;  
Of each incumbrance clear the hall –  
Jenny her silken ’kerchief folds,

20   And blear-ey’d Will the black lot holds;

Now laughing, stops, with ‘Silence\! hush\!’  
And Peggy Pout gives Sam a push. –  
The Blind-man’s arms, extended wide,  
Sam slips between; – ‘O woe betide  
Thee, clumsy Will\!’ – but titt’ring Kate  
Is pen’d up in the corner strait\!  
And now Will’s eyes beheld the play,  
He thought his face was t’other way. –  
‘Now, Kitty, now; what chance hast thou,

30  ‘Roger so near thee, Trips; I vow\!\[’\]

She catches him – then Roger ties  
His own head up – but not his eyes;  
For thro’ the slender cloth he sees,  
And runs at Sam, who slips with ease  
His clumsy hold; and, dodging round,  
Sukey is tumbled on the ground\! –  
’See what it is to play unfair\!  
‘Where cheating is, there’s mischief there.’  
But Roger still pursues the chace, –

40  ‘He sees\! he sees\!’ cries softly Grace;

‘O Roger, thou, unskill’d in art,  
‘Must, surer bound, go thro’ thy part\!’  
Now Kitty, pert, repeats the rhymes,  
And Roger turns him round three times;  
Then pauses ere he starts – but Dick  
Was mischief bent upon a trick:  
Down on his hands and knees he lay,  
Directly in the Blind-man’s way –  
Then cries out, ‘Hem\!’ Hodge heard, and ran

50   With hood-wink’d chance – sure of his man;

But down he came. – Alas, how frail  
Our best of hopes, how soon they fail\!  
With crimson drops he stains the ground,  
Confusion startles all around\!  
Poor piteous Dick supports his head,  
And fain would cure the hurt he made;  
But Kitty hasted with a key,  
And down his back they strait convey  
The cold relief – the blood is stay’d,

60   And Hodge again holds up his head.

Such are the fortunes of the game,  
And those who play should stop the same  
By wholesome laws; such as all those  
Who on the blinded man impose,  
Stand in his stead; as long a-gone  
When men were first a nation grown;  
Lawless they liv’d – till wantonness  
And liberty began t’ increase;  
And one man lay in another’s way,

70   Then laws were made to keep fair play.

SCENE \[1\]

*The Coast of France, King Edward and Nobles.  
The Army*.

KING: O thou, to whose fury the nations are

But as dust\! maintain thy servant’s right.  
Without thine aid, the twisted mail, and spear,  
And forged helm, and shield of seven times beaten brass,  
Are idle trophies of the vanquisher.  
When confusion rages, when the field is in a flame,  
When the cries of blood tear horror from heav’n,  
And yelling death runs up and down the ranks,  
Let Liberty, the charter’d right of Englishmen,

10  Won by our fathers in many a glorious field,

Enerve my soldiers; let Liberty  
Blaze in each countenance, and fire the battle.  
The enemy fight in chains, invisible chains, but heavy;  
Their minds are fetter’d; then how can they be free,  
While, like the mounting flame,  
We spring to battle o’er the floods of death?  
And these fair youths, the flow’r of England,  
Vent’ring their lives in my most righteous cause,  
O sheathe their hearts with triple steel, that they

20   May emulate their father’s virtues.

And thou, my son, be strong; thou fightest for a crown  
That death can never ravish from thy brow,  
A crown of glory: but from thy very dust  
Shall beam a radiance, to fire the breasts  
Of youth unborn\! Our names are written equal  
In fame’s wide trophied hall; ’tis ours to gild  
The letters, and to make them shine with gold  
That never tarnishes: whether Third Edward,  
Or the Prince of Wales, or Montacute, or Mortimer,

30   Or ev’n the least by birth, shall gain the brightest fame,

Is in his hand to whom all men are equal.  
The world of men are like the num’rous stars,  
That beam and twinkle in the depth of night,  
Each clad in glory according to his sphere; –  
But we, that wander from our native seats,  
And beam forth lustre on a darkling world,  
Grow larger as we advance\! and some perhaps  
The most obscure at home, that scarce were seen  
To twinkle in their sphere, may so advance,

40   That the astonish’d world, with up-turn’d eyes,

Regardless of the moon, and those that once were bright,  
Stand only for to gaze upon their splendor\!  
*He here knights the Prince, and other young Nobles*.

Now let us take a just revenge for those  
Brave Lords, who fell beneath the bloody axe  
At Paris. Thanks, noble Harcourt, for ’twas  
By your advice we landed here in Brittany –  
A country not yet sown with destruction,  
And where the fiery whirlwind of swift war  
Has not yet swept its desolating wing. –

50   Into three parties we divide by day,

And separate march, but join again at night:  
Each knows his rank, and Heav’n marshal all.

*Exeunt*.



SCENE \[2\]

*English Court; Lionel, Duke of Clarence; Queen Philippa, Lords, Bishop, &c*.

CLARENCE: My Lords, I have, by the advice of her

Whom I am doubly bound to obey, my Parent  
And my Sovereign, call’d you together.  
My task is great, my burden heavier than  
My unfledg’d years;  
Yet, with your kind assistance, Lords, I hope  
England shall dwell in peace; that while my father  
Toils in his wars, and turns his eyes on this  
His native shore, and sees commerce fly round

10   With his white wings, and sees his golden London,

And her silver Thames, throng’d with shining spires  
And corded ships; her merchants buzzing round  
Like summer bees, and all the golden cities  
In his land, overflowing with honey,  
Glory may not be dimm’d with clouds of care.  
Say, Lords, should not our thoughts be first to commerce?  
My Lord Bishop, you would recommend us agriculture?

BISHOP: Sweet Prince\! the arts of peace are great,

And no less glorious than those of war,

20   Perhaps more glorious in the ph\[i\]losophic mind.

When I sit at my home, a private man,  
My thoughts are on my gardens, and my fields,  
How to employ the hand that lacketh bread.  
If Industry is in my diocese,  
Religion will flourish; each man’s heart  
Is cultivated, and will bring forth fruit:  
This is my private duty and my pleasure.  
But as I sit in council with my prince,  
My thoughts take in the gen’ral good of the whole,

30   And England is the land favour’d by Commerce;

For Commerce, tho’ the child of Agriculture,  
Fosters his parent, who else must sweat and toil,  
And gain but scanty fare. Then, my dear Lord,  
Be England’s trade our care; and we, as tradesmen,  
Looking to the gain of this our native land.

CLAR: Oh my good Lord, true wisdom drops like honey

From your tongue, as from a worship’d oak\!  
Forgive, my Lords, my talkative youth, that speaks  
Not merely what my narrow observation has

40   Pick’d up, but what I have concluded from your lessons:

Now, by the Queen’s advice, I ask your leave  
To dine to-morrow with the Mayor of London:  
If I obtain your leave, I have another boon  
To ask, which is, the favour of your company;  
I fear Lord Percy will not give me leave.

PERCY: Dear Sir, a prince should always keep his state,

And grant his favours with a sparing hand,  
Or they are never rightly valued.  
These are my thoughts, yet it were best to go;

50    But keep a proper dignity, for now

You represent the sacred person of  
Your father; ’tis with princes as ’tis with the sun,  
If not sometimes o’er-clouded, we grow weary  
Of his officious glory.

CLAR: Then you will give me leave to shine sometimes, My Lord?

LORD: Thou hast a gallant spirit, which I fear

Will be imposed on by the closer sort\! \[*Aside*.

CLAR: Well, I’ll endeavour to take

60      Lord Percy’s advice; I have been used so much

      To dignity, that I’m sick on’t.

QUEEN PHIL: Fie, Fie, Lord Clarence; you proceed not to business,

But speak of your own pleasures.  
I hope their Lordships will excuse your giddiness.

CLAR: My Lords, the French have fitted out many

Small ships of war, that, like to ravening wolves,  
Infest our English seas, devouring all  
Our burden’d vessels, spoiling our naval flocks.  
The merchants do complain, and beg our aid.

70    PERCY: The merchants are rich enough;

Can they not help themselves?

BISH: They can, and may; but how to gain their will,

Requires our countenance and help.

PERCY: When that they find they must, my Lord, they will:

Let them but suffer awhile, and you shall see  
They will bestir themselves.

BISH: Lord Percy cannot mean that we should suffer

This disgrace; if so, we are not sovereigns  
Of the sea; our right, that Heaven gave

80   To England, when at the birth of nature

She was seated in the deep, the Ocean ceas’d  
His mighty roar; and, fawning, play’d around  
Her snowy feet, and own’d his awful Queen.  
Lord Percy, if the heart is sick, the head  
Must be aggriev’d; if but one member suffer,  
The heart doth fail. You say, my Lord, the merchants  
Can, if they will, defend themselves against  
These rovers: this is a noble scheme,  
Worthy the brave Lord Percy, and as worthy

90   His generous aid to put it into practice.

PERCY: Lord Bishop, what was rash in me, is wise

In you; I dare not own the plan. ’Tis not  
Mine. Yet will I, if you please,  
Quickly to the Lord Mayor, and work him onward  
To this most glorious voyage, on which cast  
I’ll set my whole estate.  
But we will bring these Gallic rovers under.

QUEEN PHIL: Thanks, brave Lord Percy; you have the thanks

Of England’s Queen, and will, ere long, of England.

*Exeunt*.



SCENE \[3\]

*At Cressey. Sir Thomas Dagworth and Lord Audley, meeting*.

AUD: Good morrow, brave Sir Thomas; the bright morn

Smiles on our army, and the gallant sun  
Springs from the hills like a young hero  
Into the battle, shaking his golden locks  
Exultingly; this is a promising day.

DAGW: Why, my Lord Audley, I don’t know.

Give me your hand, and now I’ll tell you what  
I think you do not know – Edward’s afraid of Philip.

AUD: Ha, Ha, Sir Thomas\! you but joke;

10   Did you eer see him fear? At Blanchetaque,

When almost singly he drove six thousand  
French from the ford, did he fear then?

DAGW: Yes, fear; that made him fight so.

AUD: By the same reason I might say, ’tis fear  
That makes you fight.

DAGW: Mayhap you may; look upon Edward’s face –

No one can say he fears. But when he turns  
His back, then I will say it to his face,  
He is afraid; he makes us all afraid.

20   I cannot bear the enemy at my back.

Now here we are at Cressy; where, to-morrow,  
To-morrow we shall know. I say, Lord Audley,  
That Edward runs away from Philip.

AUD: Perhaps you think the Prince too is afraid?

DAGW: No; God forbid\! I’m sure he is not –

He is a young lion. O I have seen him fight,

And give command, and lightning has flashed  
From his eyes across the field; I have seen him  
Shake hands with death, and strike a bargain for

30   The enemy; he has danc’d in the field

Of battle, like the youth at morrice play.  
I’m sure he’s not afraid, nor Warwick, nor none,

None of us but me; and I am very much afraid.

AUD: Are you afraid too, Sir Thomas?

I believe that as much as I believe  
The King’s afraid; but what are you afraid of?

DAGW: Of having my back laid open; we turn

Our backs to the fire, till we shall burn our skirts.

AUD: And this, Sir Thomas, you call fear? Your fear

40   Is of a different kind then from the King’s;

He fears to turn his face, and you to turn your back. –  
I do not think, Sir Thomas, you know what fear is.

                                                   *Enter Sir John Chandos*.

CHAND: Good morrow, Generals; I give you joy;

Welcome to the fields of Cressy. Here we stop,  
And wait for Philip.

DAGW: I hope so.

AUD: There, Sir Thomas; do you call that fear?

DAGW: I don’t know; perhaps he takes it by fits.

Why, noble Chandos, look you here –

50   One rotten sheep spoils the whole flock;

And if the bell-weather is tainted, I wish  
The Prince may not catch the distemper too.

CHAND: Distemper, Sir Thomas\! what distemper?

I have not heard.

DAGW: Why, Chandos, you are a wise man,

I know you understand me; a distemper  
The King caught here in France of running away.

AUD: Sir Thomas, you say, you have caught it too.

DAGW: And so will the whole army; ’tis very catching,

60   For when the coward runs, the brave man totters.

Perhaps the air of the country is the cause. –  
I feel it coming upon me, so I strive against it;  
You yet are whole, but after a few more  
Retreats, we all shall know how to retreat  
Better than fight. – To be plain, I think retreating  
Too often, takes away a soldier’s courage.

CHAND: Here comes the King himself; tell him your thoughts

Plainly, Sir Thomas.

DAGW: I’ve told him before, but his disorder

70  Makes him deaf.

*Enter King Edward and Black Prince*.

KING: Good morrow, Generals; when English courage fails,

Down goes our right to France;  
But we are conquerors every where; nothing  
Can stand our soldiers; each man is worthy  
Of a triumph. Such an army of heroes  
Ne’er shouted to the Heav’ns, nor shook the field.  
Edward, my son, thou art  
Most happy, having such command; the man  
Were base who were not fir’d to deeds

80   Above heroic, having such examples.

PRINCE: Sire\! with respect and deference I look

Upon such noble souls, and wish myself  
Worthy the high command that Heaven and you  
Have given me. When I have seen the field glow,  
And in each countenance the soul of war  
Curb’d by the manliest reason, I have been wing’d  
With certain victory; and ’tis my boast,  
And shall be still my glory. I was inspir’d  
By these brave troops.

90   DAGW: Your Grace had better make

Them all Generals.

KING: Sir Thomas Dagworth, you must have your joke,

And shall, while you can fight as you did at  
The Ford.

DAGW: I have a small petition to your Majesty.

KING: What can Sir Thomas Dagworth ask, that Edward Can refuse?

DAGW: I hope your Majesty cannot refuse so great

A trifle: I’ve gilt your cause with my best blood,

100   And would again, were I not forbid

By him whom I am bound to obey: my hands  
Are tied up, my courage shrunk and wither’d,  
My sinews slacken’d, and my voice scarce heard;.  
Therefore I beg I may return to England.

KING: I know not what you could have ask’d, Sir Thomas,

That I would not have sooner parted with  
Than such a soldier as you have been, and such a friend;  
Nay, I will know the most remote particulars  
Of this your strange petition; that, if I can,

110   I still may keep you here.

DAGW: Here on the fields of Cressy we are settled,

’Till Philip springs the tim’rous covey again.  
The Wolf is hunted down by causeless fear;  
The Lion flees, and fear usurps his heart;  
Startled, astonish’d at the clam’rous Cock;  
The Eagle, that doth gaze upon the sun,  
Fears the small fire that plays about the fen;  
If, at this moment of their idle fear,  
The Dog doth seize the Wolf, the Forester the Lion,

120   The Negro in the crevice of the rock,

Doth seize the soaring Eagle; undone by flight,  
They tame submit; such the effect flight has  
On noble souls. Now hear its opposite:  
The tim’rous Stag starts from the thicket wild,  
The fearful Crane springs from the splashy fen,  
The shining Snake glides o’er the bending grass,  
The Stag turns head\! and bays the crying Hounds;  
The Crane o’ertaken, sighteth with the Hawk;  
The Snake doth turn, and bite the padding foot;

130  And, if your Majesty’s afraid of Philip,

You are more like a Lion than a Crane:  
Therefore I beg I may return to England.

KING: Sir Thomas, now I understand your mirth,

Which often plays with Wisdom for its pastime,  
And brings good counsel from the breast of laughter,  
I hope you’ll stay, and see us fight this battle,  
And reap rich harvest in the fields of Cressy;  
Then go to England, tell them how we fight,  
And set all hearts on fire to be with us.

140   Philip is plum’d, and thinks we flee from him,

Else he would never dare to attack us. Now,  
Now the quarry’s set\! and Death doth sport  
In the bright sunshine of this fatal day.

DAGW: Now my heart dances, and I am as light

As the young bridegroom going to be married.  
Now must I to my soldiers, get them ready,  
Furbish our armours bright, new plume our helms,  
And we will sing, like the young housewives busied  
In the dairy; my feet are wing’d, but not

150   For flight, an please your grace.

KING: If all my soldiers are as pleas’d as you,

’Twill be a gallant thing to fight or die;  
Then I can never be afraid of Philip.

DAGW: A raw-bon’d fellow t’other day pass’d by me;

I told him to put off his hungry looks –  
He answer’d me, ‘I hunger for another battle.’  
I saw a little Welchman with a fiery face;  
I told him he look’d like a candle half  
Burn’d out; he answer’d, he was ‘pig enough

160  ‘To light another pattle.’ Last night, beneath

The moon I walk’d abroad, when all had pitch’d  
Their tents, and all were still,  
I heard a blooming youth singing a song  
He had compos’d, and at each pause he wip’d  
His dropping eyes. The ditty was, ‘if he  
‘Return’d victorious, he should wed a maiden  
‘Fairer than snow, and rich as midsummer.’  
Another wept, and wish’d health to his father.  
I chid them both, but gave them noble hopes.

170  These are the minds that glory in the battle,

And leap and dance to hear the trumpet sound.

KING: Sir Thomas Dagworth, be thou near our person;

Thy heart is richer than the vales of France:  
I will not part with such a man as thee.  
If Philip came arm’d in the ribs of death,  
And shook his mortal dart against my head,  
Thoud’st laugh his fury into nerveless shame\!  
Go now, for thou art suited to the work,  
Throughout the camp; enflame the timorous,

180  Blow up the sluggish into ardour, and

Confirm the strong with strength, the weak inspire,  
And wing their brows with hope and expectation:  
Then to our tent return, and meet to council.

*Exit Dagworth*.

CHAND: That man’s a hero in his closet, and more

A hero to the servants of his house  
Than to the gaping world; he carries windows  
In that enlarged breast of his, that all  
May see what’s done within.

PRINCE: He is a genuine Englishman, my Chandos,

190  And hath the spirit of Liberty within him.

Forgive my prejudice, Sir John; I think  
My Englishmen the bravest people on  
The face of the earth.

CHAND: Courage, my Lord, proceeds from self-dependence;

Teach man to think he’s a free agent,  
Give but a slave his liberty, he’ll shake  
Off sloth, and build himself a hut, and hedge  
A spot of ground; this he’ll defend; ’tis his  
By right of nature: thus set in action,

200  He will still move onward to plan conveniences,

’Till glory fires his breast to enlarge his castle,  
While the poor slave drudges all day, in hope  
To rest at night.

KING: O Liberty, how glorious art thou\!

I see thee hov’ring o’er my army, with  
Thy wide-stretch’d plumes; I see thee  
Lead them on to battle;

210  I see thee blow thy golden trumpet, while

Thy sons shout the strong shout of victory\!  
O noble Chandos\! think thyself a gardener,  
My son a vine, which I commit unto  
Thy care; prune all extravagant shoots, and guide  
Th’ ambitious tendrils in the paths of wisdom;  
Water him with thy advice, and Heav’n  
Rain fresh’ning dew upon his branches. And,  
O Edward, my dear son\! learn to think lowly of  
Thyself, as we may all each prefer other –  
’Tis the best policy, and ’tis our duty.

*Exit King Edward*.

PRINCE: And may our duty, Chandos, be our pleasure –

220   Now we are alone, Sir John, I will unburden,

And breathe my hopes into the burning air,  
Where thousand deaths are posting up and down,  
Commission’d to this fatal field of Cressy;  
Methinks I see them arm my gallant soldiers,  
And gird the sword upon each thigh, and fit  
Each shining helm, and string each stubborn bow,  
And dance to the neighing of our steeds.  
Methinks the shout begins, the battle burns;  
Methinks I see them perch on English crests,

230  And roar the wild flame of fierce war, upon

The thronged enemy\! In truth, I am too full;  
It is my sin to love the noise of war.  
Chandos, thou seest my weakness; strong nature  
Will bend or break us; my blood, like a springtide,  
Does rise so high, to overflow all bounds  
Of moderation; while Reason, in his  
Frail bark, can see no shore or bound for vast  
Ambition. Come, take the helm, my Chandos,  
That my full-blown sails overset me not

240  In the wild tempest; condemn my ’ventrous youth,

That plays with danger, as the innocent child,  
Unthinking, plays upon the viper’s den:  
I am a coward, in my reason, Chandos.

CHAND: You are a man, my prince, and a brave man,

If I can judge of actions; but your heat  
Is the effect of youth, and want of use;  
Use makes the armed field and noisy war  
Pass over as a summer cloud, unregarded,  
Or but expected as a thing of course.

250  Age is contemplative; each rolling year

Brings forth fruit to the mind’s treasure-house;  
While vacant youth doth crave and seek about  
Within itself, and findeth discontent:  
Then, tir’d of thought, impatient takes the wing,  
Seizes the fruits of time, attacks experience,  
Roams round vast Nature’s forest, where no bounds  
Are set, the swiftest may have room, the strongest  
Find prey; till tir’d at length, sated and tired  
With the changing sameness, old variety,

260  We sit us down, and view our former joys

With distaste and dislike.

PRINCE: Then if we must tug for experience,

Let us not fear to beat round Nature’s wilds,  
And rouze the strongest prey; then if we fall,  
We fall with glory; I know the wolf  
Is dangerous to fight, not good for food,  
Nor is the hide a comely vestment; so  
We have our battle for our pains. I know  
That youth has need of age to point fit prey,

270  And oft the stander-by shall steal the fruit

Of th’ other’s labour. This is philosophy;  
These are the tricks of the world; but the pure soul  
Shall mount on native wings, disdaining  
Little sport, and cut a path into the heaven of glory,  
Leaving a track of light for men to wonder at.  
I’m glad my father does not hear me talk;  
You can find friendly excuses for me, Chandos;  
But do you not think, Sir John, that if it please  
Th’ Almighty to stretch out my span of life,

280  I shall with pleasure view a glorious action,

Which my youth master’d.

CHAND: Considerate age, my Lord, views motives,

And not acts; when neither warbling voice,  
Nor trilling pipe is heard, nor pleasure sits  
With trembling age; the voice of Conscience then,  
Sweeter than music in a summer’s eve,  
Shall warble round the snowy head, and keep  
Sweet symphony to feather’d angels, sitting  
As guardians round your chair; then shall the pulse

290  Beat slow, and taste, and touch, and sight, and sound, and smell,

That sing and dance round Reason’s fine-wrought throne,  
Shall flee away, and leave him all forlorn;  
Yet not forlorn if Conscience is his friend.

*Exeunt*.



SCENE \[4\]

*In Sir Thomas Dagworth’s Tent. Dagworth and William his Man*.

DAGW: Bring hither my armour, William;  
Ambition is the growth of ev’ry clime.

WILL: Does it grow in England, Sir?

DAGW: Aye, it grows most in lands most cultivated.

WILL: Then it grows most in France; the vines here  
Are finer than any we have in England.

DAGW: Aye, but the oaks are not.

WILL: What is the tree you mentioned? I don’t think  
I ever saw it.

10  DAGW: Ambition.

WILL: Is it a little creeping root that grows in ditches?

DAGW: Thou dost not understand me, William.

It is a root that grows in every breast;  
Ambition is the desire or passion that one man  
Has to get before another, in any pursuit after glory;  
But I don’t think you have any of it.

WILL: Yes, I have; I have a great ambition to know every thing, Sir.

DAGW: But when our first ideas are wrong, what follows

20 must all be wrong of course; ’tis best to know a little, and to know that little aright.

WILL: Then, Sir, I should be glad to know if it was not ambition that brought over our King to France to fight for his right?

DAGW: Tho’ the knowledge of that will not profit thee much, yet I will tell you that it was ambition.

WILL: Then if ambition is a sin, we are all guilty in coming with him, and in fighting for him.

30 DAGW: Now, William, thou dost thrust the question

home; but I must tell you, that guilt being an act of the mind, none are guilty but those whose minds are prompted by that same ambition.

WILL: Now I always thought, that a man might be guilty of doing wrong, without knowing it was wrong.

DAGW: Thou art a natural philosopher, and knowest truth by instinct; while reason runs aground, as we have run our argument. Only remember, William, all have it in their power to know the motives of their own actions, and ’tis a sin to act without some reason.

40  WILL: And whoever acts without reason, may do a great

deal of harm without knowing it.

DAGW: Thou art an endless moralist.

WILL: Now there’s a story come into my head, that I will tell your honour, if you’ll give me leave.

DAGW: No, William, save it till another time; this is no time for storytelling; but here comes one who is as entertaining as a good story.

*Enter Peter Blunt*.

PETER: Yonder’s a musician going to play before the King; it’s a new song about the French and English, and the

50    Prince has made the minstrel a ’squire, and given him I

don’t know what, and I can’t tell whether he don’t mention us all one by one; and he is to write another about all us that are to die, that we may be remembered in Old England, for all our blood and bones are in France; and a great deal more that we shall all hear by and by; and I came to tell your honour, because you love to hear war-songs.

DAGW: And who is this minstrel, Peter, do’st know?

PETER: O aye, I forgot to tell that; he has got the same

60   name as Sir John Chandos, that the prince is always

with – the wise man, that knows us all as well as your honour, only e’nt so good natur’d.

DAGW: I thank you, Peter, for your information, but not for your compliment, which is not true; there’s as much difference between him and me, as between glittering sand and fruitful mold; or shining glass and a wrought diamond, set in rich gold, and fitted to the finger of an emperor: such is that worthy Chandos.

PETER: I know your honour does not think any thing of

70    yourself, but every body else does.

DAGW: Go, Peter, get you gone; flattery is delicious, even from the lips of a babbler.

*Exit Peter*.

WILL: I never flatter your honour.

DAGW: I don’t know that.

WILL: Why you know, Sir, when we were in England, at the tournament at Windsor, and the Earl of Warwick was tumbled over, you ask’d me if he did not look well when he fell? and I said, No, he look’d very foolish; and you was very angry with me for not flattering you.

80  DAGW: You mean that I was angry with you for not flattering

the Earl of Warwick.

*Exeunt*.



SCENE \[5\]

*Sir Thomas Dagwort’s Tent. Sir Thomas Dagworth – to him*.

*Enter Sir Walter Manny*.

SIR WALTER: Sir Thomas Dagworth, I have been weeping  
Over the men that are to die to-day.

DAGW: Why, brave Sir Walter, you or I may fall.

SIR WALTER: I know this breathing flesh must lie and rot,

Cover’d with silence and forgetfulness. –  
Death wons in cities’ smoke, and in still night,  
When men sleep in their beds, walketh about\!  
How many in walled cities lie and groan,  
Turning themselves upon their beds,

10   Talking with death, answering his hard demands\!

How many walk in darkness, terrors are round  
The curtains of their beds, destruction is  
Ready at the door\! How many sleep  
In earth, cover’d with stones and deathy dust,  
Resting in quietness, whose spirits walk  
Upon the clouds of heaven, to die no more\!  
Yet death is terrible, tho’ borne on angels’ wings\!  
How terrible then is the field of death,  
Where he doth rend the vault of heaven,

20   And shake the gates of hell\!

O Dagworth, France is sick\! the very sky,  
Tho’ sunshine light it, seems to me as pale  
As the pale fainting man on his death-bed,  
Whose face is shewn by light of sickly taper\!  
It makes me sad and sick at very heart,  
Thousands must fall to-day\!

DAGW: Thousands of souls must leave this prison house,

To be exalted to those heavenly fields,  
Where songs of triumph, palms of victory,

30   Where peace, and joy, and love, and calm content,

Sit singing in the azure clouds, and strew  
Flowers of heaven’s growth over the banquet-table:  
Bind ardent Hope upon your feet like shoes,  
Put on the robe of preparation,  
The table is prepar’d in shining heaven,  
The flowers of immortality are blown;  
Let those that fight, fight in good stedfastness,  
And those that fall shall rise in victory.

SIR WALTER: I’ve often seen the burning field of war,

40   And often heard the dismal clang of arms;

But never, till this fatal day of Cressy,  
Has my soul fainted with these views of death\!  
I seem to be in one great charnel-house,  
And seem to scent the rotten carcases\!  
I seem to hear the dismal yells of death,  
While the black gore drops from his horrid jaws:  
Yet I not fear the monster in his pride. –  
But O the souls that are to die to-day\!

DAGW: Stop, brave Sir Walter; let me drop a tear,

50   Then let the clarion of war begin;

I’ll fight and weep, ’tis in my country’s cause;  
I’ll weep and shout for glorious liberty.  
Grim war shall laugh and shout, decked in tears,  
And blood shall flow like streams across the  
meadows, That murmur down their pebbly channels, and  
Spend their sweet lives to do their country service:  
Then shall England’s verdure shoot, her fields shall smile,  
Her ships shall sing across the foaming sea,  
Her mariners shall use the flute and viol,

60  And rattling guns, and black and dreary war,

Shall be no more.

SIR WALTER: Well; let the trumpet sound, and the drum beat;  
Let war stain the blue heavens with bloody banners,  
I’ll draw my sword, nor ever sheath it up,  
’Till England blow the trump of victory,  
Or I lay stretch’d upon the field of death\!

*Exeunt*.



SCENE \[6\]

*In the Camp. Several of the Warriors met at the King’s Tent with a Minstrel, who sings the following Song*:

O sons of Trojan Brutus, cloath’d in war,  
Whose voices are the thunder of the field,  
Rolling dark clouds o’er France, muffling the sun  
In sickly darkness like a dim eclipse,  
Threatening as the red brow of storms, as fire  
Burning up nations in your wrath and fury\!

Your ancestors came from the fires of Troy,  
\(Like lions rouz’d by light’ning from their dens,  
Whose eyes do glare against the stormy fires\)

10   Heated with war, fill’d with the blood of Greeks,

With helmets hewn, and shields covered with gore,  
In navies black, broken with wind and tide\!

They landed in firm array upon the rocks  
Of Albion; they kiss’d the rocky shore;  
‘Be thou our mother, and our nurse,’ they said;  
‘Our children’s mother, and thou shalt be our grave;  
‘The sepulchre of ancient Troy, from whence  
‘Shall rise cities, and thrones, and arms, and awful  
pow’rs.’

Our fathers swarm from the ships. Giant voices

20   Are heard from the hills, the enormous sons

Of Ocean run from rocks and caves: wild men,  
Naked and roaring like lions, hurling rocks,  
And wielding knotty clubs, like oaks entangled  
Thick as a forest, ready for the axe.

Our fathers move in firm array to battle,  
The savage monsters rush like roaring fire;  
Like as a forest roars with crackling flames,  
When the red lightning, borne by furious storms,  
Lights on some woody shore; the parched heavens

30   Rain fire into the molten raging sea\!

The smoaking trees are strewn upon the shore,  
Spoil’d of their verdure\! O how oft have they  
Defy’d the storm that howled o’er their heads\!  
Our fathers, sweating, lean on their spears, and view  
The mighty dead: giant bodies, streaming blood,  
Dread visages, frowning in silent death\!

Then Brutus spoke, inspir’d; our fathers sit

40   Attentive on the melancholy shore: –

Hear ye the voice of Brutus – ‘The flowing waves  
‘Of time come rolling o’er my breast,’ he said;  
‘And my heart labours with futurity:  
‘Our sons shall rule the empire of the sea.

‘Their mighty wings shall stretch from east to west,  
‘Their nest is in the sea; but they shall roam  
‘Like eagles for the prey; nor shall the young  
‘Crave or be heard; for plenty shall bring forth,  
‘Cities shall sing, and vales in rich array  
‘Shall laugh, whose fruitful laps bend down with fulness.

‘Our sons shall rise from thrones in joy,

50  ‘Each one buckling on his armour; Morning

‘Shall be prevented by their swords gleaming,  
‘And Evening hear their song of victory\!  
‘Their towers shall be built upon the rocks,  
‘Their daughters shall sing, surrounded with shining spears\!

‘Liberty shall stand upon the cliffs of Albion,  
‘Casting her blue eyes over the green ocean;  
‘Or, tow’ring, stand upon the roaring waves,  
‘Stretching her mighty spear o’er distant lands;  
‘While, with her eagle wings, she covereth  
‘Fair Albion’s shore, and all her families’



### ***********Dramatic Fragments***

PROLOGUE, INTENDED FOR A DRAMATIC PIECE OF KING EDWARD THE FOURTH

O For a voice like thunder, and a tongue  
To drown the throat of war\! – When the senses

Are shaken, and the soul is driven to madness,  
Who can stand? When the souls of the oppressed  
Fight in the troubled air that rages, who can stand?  
When the whirlwind of fury comes from the  
Throne of God, when the frowns of his countenance  
Drive the nations together, who can stand?  
When Sin claps his broad wings over the battle,

10   And sails rejoicing in the flood of Death;

When souls are torn to everlasting fire,  
And fiends of Hell rejoice upon the slain,  
O who can stand? O who hath caused this?  
O who can answer at the throne of God?  
The Kings and Nobles of the Land have done it\!  
Hear it not, Heaven, thy Ministers have done it\!

PROLOGUE TO KING JOHN

Justice hath heaved a sword to plunge in Albion’s breast; for Albion’s sins are crimson dy’d, and the red scourge follows her desolate sons\! Then Patriot rose; full oft did Patriot rise, when Tyranny hath stain’d fair Albion’s breast with her own children’s gore. Round his majestic feet deep thunders roll; each heart does tremble, and each knee grows slack. The stars of heaven tremble: the roaring voice of war, the trumpet, calls to battle\! Brother in brother’s blood must bathe, rivers of death\! O land, most hapless\!

10    O beauteous island, how forsaken\! Weep from thy

silver fountains; weep from thy gentle rivers\! The angel of the island weeps\! Thy widowed virgins weep beneath thy shades\! Thy aged fathers gird themselves for war\! The sucking infant lives to die in battle; the weeping mother feeds him for the slaughter\! The husbandman doth leave his bending harvest\! Blood cries afar\! The land doth sow itself\! The glittering youth of courts must gleam in arms\! The aged senators their ancient swords assume\! The trembling sinews of old age must work the work of death

20    against their progeny; for Tyranny hath stretch’d his

purple arm, and ‘blood,’ he cries; ‘the chariots and the horses, the noise of shout, and dreadful thunder of the battle heard afar\!’ – Beware, O Proud\! thou shalt be humbled; thy cruel brow, thine iron heart is smitten, though lingering Fate is slow. O yet may Albion smile again, and stretch her peaceful arms, and raise her golden head, exultingly\! Her citizens shall throng about her gates, her mariners shall sing upon the sea, and myriads shall to her temples crowd\! Her sons shall joy as

30   in the morning\! Her daughters sing as to the rising year\!



A WAR SONG TO ENGLISHMEN

Prepare, prepare, the iron helm of war,  
Bring forth the lots, cast in the spacious orb;  
Th’ Angel of Fate turns them with mighty hands,  
And casts them out upon the darken’d earth\!

         Prepare, prepare.

Prepare your hearts for Death’s cold hand\! prepare  
Your souls for flight, your bodies for the earth\!  
Prepare your arms for glorious victory\!  
Prepare your eyes to meet a holy God\!

10                                                   Prepare, prepare.

Whose fatal scroll is that? Methinks ’tis mine\!  
Why sinks my heart, why faultereth my tongue?  
Had I three lives, I’d die in such a cause,  
And rise, with ghosts, over the well-fought field.

          Prepare, prepare.

The arrows of Almighty God are drawn\!  
Angels of Death stand in the low’ring heavens\!  
Thousands of souls must seek the realms of light,  
And walk together on the clouds of heaven\!

Soldiers, prepare\! Our cause is Heaven’s cause;  
Soldiers, prepare\! Be worthy of our cause:  
Prepare to meet our fathers in the sky:  
Prepare, O troops, that are to fall to-day\!

Prepare, prepare.

Alfred shall smile, and make his harp rejoice;  
The Norman William, and the learned Clerk,  
And Lion Heart, and black-brow’d Edward, with  
His loyal queen shall rise, and welcome us\!

### *******Poems Written in a Copy of*** Poetical Sketches

SONG 1ST BY A SHEPHERD

Welcome stranger to this place,  
Where joy doth sit on every bough,  
Paleness flies from every face,  
We reap not what we do not sow.

Innocence doth like a Rose,  
Bloom on every Maidens cheek;  
Honor twines around her brows,  
The jewel Health adorns her neck.

SONG 2ND BY A YOUNG SHEPHERD

When the trees do laugh with our merry wit,  
And the green hill laughs with the noise of it,  
When the meadow laughs with lively green,  
And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene;

When the greenwood laughs with the voice of joy,  
And the dimpling stream runs laughing by,  
When Edessa, and Lyca, and Emilie,  
With their sweet round mouths sing Ha, Ha, He.

When the painted birds laugh in the shade

10   Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread,

Come live and be merry and join with me,  
To sing the sweet chorus of Ha, Ha, He.

SONG 3RD BY AN OLD SHEPHERD

When silver snow decks Sylvio’s cloaths  
And jewel hangs at shepherd’s nose,  
We can abide life’s pelting storm  
That makes our limbs quake, if our hearts be warm.

Whilst Virtue is our walking staff,  
And Truth a lantern to our path;  
We can abide life’s pelting storm  
That makes our limbs quake, if our hearts be warm.

Blow boisterous Wind, stern Winter frown,

10   Innocence is a Winter’s gown;

So clad, we’ll abide life’s pelting storm  
That makes our limbs quake, if our hearts be warm.



## ********SONGS FROM ‘AN ISLAND IN THE MOON’





*From* CHAP 3d

In the Moon as Phebus stood over his oriental Gardening O ay come Ill sing you a song said the Cynic, the trumpeter shit in his hat said the Epicurean & clapt it on his head said the Pythagorean

Ill begin again said the Cynic  
Little Phebus came strutting in  
With his fat belly & his round chin  
What is it you would please to have  
Ho Ho

10  I wont let it go at only so & so

\*

Then the Cynic sung  
Honour & Genius is all I ask  
And I ask the Gods no more  
![Image](images/000005.jpg)  
Here Aradobo suckd his under lip

*From* CHAP 6

Ah said Sipsop, I only wish Jack \[*Hunter*\] Tearguts had had the cutting of Plutarch he understands anatomy better than any of the Ancients hell plunge his knife up to the hilt in a single drive and thrust his fist in, and all in the space of a Quarter of an hour. he does not mind their crying – tho they cry ever so hell Swear at them & keep them down with his fist & tell them that hell scrape their bones if they done lay still & be quiet – What the devil should the people in the hospital that have it done for

10  nothing, make such a piece of work for

Hang that said Suction let us have a Song  
Then \[*Sipsop sang*\] the Cynic sang

When old corruption first begun  
Adornd in yellow vest  
He committed on flesh a whoredom  
O what a wicked beast



2  
From them a callow babe did spring  
And old corruption smild  
To think his race should never end

20  For now he had a child



3  
He calld him Surgery & fed  
The babe with his own milk  
For flesh & he could neer agree  
She would not let him suck



4  
And this he always kept in mind  
And formd a crooked knife  
And ran about with bloody hands  
To seek his mothers life



5  
And as he ran to seek his mother

30  He met with a dead woman

He fell in love & married her  
A deed which is not common



6  
She soon grew pregnant & brought forth  
Scurvy & spotted fever  
The father grind & skipt about  
And said I’m made for ever



7  
For now I have procurd these imps  
Ill try experiments  
With that he tied poor scurvy down

40  & stopt up all its vents



8  
And when the child began to swell  
He shouted out aloud  
Ive found the dropsy out & soon  
Shall do the world more good



9  
He took up fever by the neck  
And cut out all its spots  
And thro the holes which he had made  
He first discovered guts

*From* CHAP 8

Hear then the pride & knowledge of a Sailor  
His sprit sail fore sail main sail & his mizen  
A poor frail man god wot I know none frailer  
I know no greater sinner than John Taylor

\*

Phebe drest like beauties Queen  
Jellicoe in faint peagreen  
Sitting all beneath a grot  
Where the little \[*lambs do*\] lambkins trot

Maidens dancing loves a sporting

10   All the country folks a courting

Susan Johnny Bet & Joe  
Lightly tripping on a row

Happy people who can be  
In happiness compard with ye  
The Pilgrim with his crook & hat  
Sees your happiness compleat



CHAP 9

I say this evening \[*we’d*\] we’ll all get drunk. I say dash, an Anthem an Anthem, said Suction

Hail Matrimony made of Love

80    To thy wide gates how great a drove

On purpose to be yok’d do come  
Widows & maids & Youths also  
That lightly trip on beauty’s toe  
Or sit on beauty’s bum

Hail fingerfooted lovely Creatures  
The females of our human Natures  
Formed to suckle all Mankind  
Tis you that come in time of  
need Without you we shoud never Breed

90     Or any Comfort find

For if a Damsel’s blind or lame  
Or Nature’s hand has crooked her frame  
Or if she’s deaf or is wall eyed  
Yet if her heart is well inclined  
Some tender lover she shall find  
That panteth for a Bride

The universal Poultice this  
To cure whatever is amiss  
In damsel or in Widow gay

100    It makes them smile it makes them skip

Like Birds just cured of the pip  
They chirp & hop away

Then come ye Maidens come ye Swains  
Come & be eased of all your pains  
In Matrimony’s Golden cage –

I \[*None of*\] Go & be hanged said Scopprel how can you have the face to make game of Matrimony \[*What you skipping flea how dare ye? Ill dash you through your chair says the Cynic This Quid \(cries out Miss Gittipin\) always*

110  *spoils good company in this manner & its a shame*\]

Then Quid calld upon Obtuse Angle for a Song & he wiping his face & looking on the corner of the cieling Sang

To be or not to be  
Of great capacity  
Like Sir Isaac Newton  
Or Locke or Doctor South  
Or Sherlock upon death  
Id rather be Sutton

For he did build a house

120   For aged men & youth

With walls of brick & stone  
He furnished it within  
With whatever he could win  
And all his own

He drew out of the Stocks  
His money in a box  
And sent his servant  
To Green the Bricklayer  
And to the Carpenter

130   He was so fervent

The chimneys were three score  
The windows many more  
And for convenience  
He sinks & gutters made  
And all the way he pavd  
To hinder pestilence

Was not this a good man  
Whose life was but a span  
Whose name was Sutton

140   As Locke or Doctor South

Or Sherlock upon Death  
Or Sir Isaac Newton

The Lawgiver was very attentive & begd to have it sung over again & again till the company were tired & insisted on the Lawgiver singing a song himself which he readily complied with

This city & this country has brought forth many mayors

To sit in state & give forth laws out of their old oak  
chairs

With face as brown as any nut with drinking of strong ale

150 Good English hospitality O then it did not fail

With scarlet gowns & broad gold lace would make a  
yeoman sweat

With stockings rolld above their knees & shoes as black  
as jet

With eating beef & drinking beer O they were stout and  
hale

Good English hospitality O then it did not fail

Thus sitting at the table wide the Mayor & Aldermen

Were fit to give law to the city each eat as much as ten

The hungry poor enterd the hall to eat good beef & ale

Good English hospitality O then it did not fail

Here they gave a shout & the company broke up



     *From* CHAP 11

Upon a holy thursday their innocent faces clean

The children walking two & two in grey & blue & green

Grey headed beadles walkd before with wands as white  
as snow

Till into the high dome of Pauls they like thames water  
flow

O what a multitude they seemd, these flowers of  
London town

Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own

The hum of multitudes were there but multitudes of  
lambs

\[*And all in order sit waiting the chief chanters commands*\]

Thousands of little girls & boys raising their innocent hands

10  \[*When the whole multitude of innocents their voices raise*

*Like angels on the throne of heaven raising the voice of  
praise*\]

\[*Let Cherubim & Seraphim now raise their voices high*\]

Then like a mighty wind they raise to heavn the voice of song

Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heavn among

Beneath them sit the revrend men the guardians of the poor

Then cherish pity lest you drive an angel from your door

After this they all sat silent for a quarter of an hour \[&  
*Mrs Sigtagatist*\] & Mrs Nannicantipot said it puts me in  
Mind of my \[*grand*\] mothers song

   \[*The voice/The tongues*\] When the tongues of children are

20       heard on the green

And laughing \[*upon*\] is heard on the hill  
My heart is at rest within my breast  
And every thing else is still

Then come home \[*children the sun is down*\] my children  
 the sun is gone down  
And the dews of night arise  
Come Come leave off play & let us away  
Till the morning appears in the skies

No No let us play for it is yet day  
And we cannot \[*sleep till its dark*\] go to sleep

30       \[*The flocks are at play & we cant go away*\]

Besides in the Sky the little birds fly  
And the meadows are coverd with Sheep

Well Well go & play till the light fades away  
And then go home to bed  
The little ones leaped & shouted & laughd  
And all the hills ecchoed

Then \[*Miss Gittipin*\] \[*Tilly Lolly sung*\] \[*Quid*\] sung  
Quid

O father father where are you going  
O do not walk so fast

40    O speak father speak to your little boy

Or else I shall be lost

The night it was dark & no father was there  
And the child was wet with dew  
The mire was deep & the child did weep  
And away the vapour flew

Here nobody could sing any longer, till Tilly Lally pluckd up a spirit & he sung.

O I say you Joe  
Throw us the ball

50    Ive a good mind to go

And leave you all  
I never saw saw such a bowler  
To bowl the ball in a \[*turd*\] tansey  
And to clean it with my handkercher  
Without saying a word

That Bills a foolish fellow  
\[*To hit me with the bat*\]  
He has given me a black eye  
He does not know how to handle a bat

60    Any more than a dog or a cat

He has knockd down the wicket  
And broke the stumps  
And runs without shoes to save his pumps

         Here a laugh began and Miss Gittipin sung

Leave O leave \[me\] to my sorrows  
Here Ill sit & fade away  
Till Im nothing but a spirit  
And I lose this form of clay  
Then if chance along this forest

70    Any walk in pathless ways

Thro the gloom he’ll see my shadow  
Hear my voice upon the Breeze

The Lawgiver all the while sat delighted to see them in such a serious humour Mr Scopprell said he you must be acquainted with a great many songs. O dear sir Ho Ho Ho I am no singer I must beg of one of these tender hearted ladies to sing for me – they all declined & he was forced to sing himself

Theres Doctor Clash

80    And Signior Falalasole

O they sweep in the cash  
Into their purse hole  
Fa me la sol La me fa Sol

And the shout of his thousands fills his heart with  
rejoicing & victory  
And the shout of his thousands fills his heart with

## **********THERE IS NO NATURAL RELIGION**





\[a\]

The Argument. Man has no notion of moral fitness but from Education. Naturally he is only a natural organ subject to Sense.

I Man cannot naturally Percieve. but through his natural or bodily organs.

II Man by his reasoning power. can only compare & judge of what he has already perciev’d.

III From a perception of only 3 senses or 3 elements none could deduce a fourth or fifth

IV None could have other than natural or organic thoughts if he had none but organic perceptions

V Mans desires are limited by his perceptions. none can desire what he has not perciev’d

VI The desires & perceptions of man untaught by any thing but organs of sense, must be limited to objects of sense.

Conclusion. If it were not for the Poetic or Prophetic character the Philosophic & Experimental would soon be at the ratio of all things, & stand still unable to do other than repeat the same dull round over again



\[b\]

I Mans perceptions are not bounded by organs of perception. he percieves more than sense \(tho’ ever so acute\) can discover.

II Reason or the ratio of all we have already known. is not the same that it shall be when we know more.

\[III lacking\]

IV The bounded is loathed by its possessor. The same dull round even of a univer\[s\]e would soon become a mill with complicated wheels

V If the many become the same as the few when possess’d, More\! More\! is the cry of a mistaken soul, less than All cannot satisfy Man.

VI If any could desire what he is incapable of possessing, despair must be his eternal lot.

VII The desire of Man being Infinite the possession is Infinite & himself Infinite

Application. He who sees the Infinite in all things sees God. He who sees the Ratio only sees himself only.

Therefore God becomes as we are, that we may be as he is



## **********ALL RELIGIONS ARE ONE**



The Voice of one crying in the Wilderness





The Argument. As the true method of knowledge is experiment the true faculty of knowing must be the faculty which experiences. This faculty I treat of.

PRINCIPLE1st That the Poetic Genius is the true Man. and that the body or outward form of Man is derived from the Poetic Genius. Likewise that the forms of all things are derived from their Genius, which by the Ancients was call’d an Angel & Spirit & Demon.

PRINCIPLE 2d As all men are alike in outward form, So \(and with the same infinite variety\) all are alike in the Poetic Genius

PRINCIPLE 3d No man can think write or speak from his heart, but he must intend truth. Thus all sects of Philosophy are from the Poetic Genius adapted to the weaknesses of every individual

PRINCIPLE 4 As none by travelling over known lands can find out the unknown. So from already acquired knowledge Man could not acquire more. therefore an universal Poetic Genius exists

PRINCIPLE 5 The Religeons of all Nations are derived from each Nation’s different reception of the Poetic Genius which is every where call’d the Spirit of Prophecy.

PRINCIPLE 6 The Jewish & Christian Testaments are An original derivation from the Poetic Genius. this is necessary from the confined nature of bodily sensation

PRINCIPLE 7th As all men are alike \(tho’ infinitely various\) So all Religions & as all similars have one source.

The true Man is the source he being the Poetic Genius



## ********THE BOOK OF THEL





PLATE i

THEL’S MOTTO

Does the Eagle know what is in the pit?  
Or wilt thou go ask the Mole:  
Can Wisdom be put in a silver rod?  
Or Love in a golden bowl?

PLATE I

THEL

I

The daughters of Mne Seraphim led round their sunny flocks,

All but the youngest. she in paleness sought the secret air.

To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day:

Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard:

And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew.

O life of this our spring\! why fades the lotus of the water?

Why fade these children of the spring? born but to smile & fall.

Ah\! Thel is like a watry bow, and like a parting cloud,

Like a reflection in a glass. like shadows in the water.

10  Like dreams of infants. like a smile upon an infants face,

Like the doves voice, like transient day, like music in the air;

Ah\! gentle may I lay me down, and gentle rest my head.

And gentle sleep the sleep of death. and gentle hear the voice

Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time.

The Lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass  
Answer’d the lovely maid and said: I am a watry weed,  
And I am very small, and love to dwell in lowly vales;  
So weak, the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head  
Yet I am visited from heaven. and he that smiles on all.  
Walks in the valley. and each morn over me spreads his  


20    hand

Saying, rejoice thou humble grass, thou new-born lilly flower,

Thou gentle maid of silent valleys. and of modest brooks;

For thou shalt be clothed in light, and fed with morning manna:

Till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs

To flourish in eternal vales: then why should Thel complain,



PLATE 2

Why should the mistress of the vales of Har, utter a sigh.

She ceasd & smild in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine.

Thel answerd. O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley.  
Giving to those that cannot crave, the voiceless, the o’ertired.

Thy breath doth nourish the innocent lamb, he smells thy milky garments,

He crops thy flowers. while thou sittest smiling in his face,

Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints.

Thy wine doth purify the golden honey, thy perfume,

Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs

10  Revives the milked cow, & tames the fire-breathing steed.

But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun:

I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place.

Queen of the vales the Lilly answerd, ask the tender cloud,

And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky,

And why it scatters its bright beauty thro’ the humid air.

Descend O little cloud & hover before the eyes of Thel.

The Cloud descended, and the Lilly bowd her modest head:

And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass.



PLATE 3

II

O little Cloud the virgin said, I charge thee tell to me,

Why thou complainest not when in one hour thou fade away:

Then we shall seek thee but not find; ah Thel is like to Thee.

I pass away. yet I complain, and no one hears my voice.

The Cloud then shew’d his golden head & his bright form emerg’d,

Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel.

O virgin know’st thou not. our steeds drink of the golden springs

Where Luvah doth renew his horses: look’st thou on my youth,

And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more.

10  Nothing remains; O maid I tell thee, when I pass away,

It is to tenfold life, to love, to peace, and raptures holy:

Unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers;

And court the fair eyed dew. to take me to her shining tent;

The weeping virgin, trembling kneels before the risen sun,

Till we arise link’d in a golden band, and never part;

But walk united, bearing food to all our tender flowers

Dost thou O little Cloud? I fear that I am not like thee;

For I walk through the vales of Har. and smell the sweetest flowers:

But I feed not the little flowers: I hear the warbling birds.

20  But I feed not the warbling birds. they fly and seek their food;

But Thel delights in these no more because I fade away.

And all shall say. without a use this shining woman liv’d

Or did she only live. to be at death the food of worms.

The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answer’d thus.

Then if thou art the food of worms, O virgin of the skies,

How great thy use. how great thy blessing; every thing that lives,

Lives not alone. nor for itself: fear not and I will call

The weak worm from its lowly bed, and thou shalt hear its voice.

Come forth worm of the silent valley, to thy pensive queen.

30  The helpless worm arose, and sat upon the Lillys leaf,

And the bright Cloud saild on, to find his partner in the vale.



PLATE 4

III

Then Thel astonish’d view’d the Worm upon its dewy bed.

Art thou a Worm? image of weakness. art thou but a Worm?

I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf:

Ah weep not little voice, thou can’st not speak. but thou can’st weep;

Is this a Worm? I see thee lay helpless & naked: weeping,

And none to answer, none to cherish thee with mothers smiles.

The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice, & raisd her pitying head;

She bow’d over the weeping infant. and her life exhal’d

In milky fondness. then on Thel she fix’d her humble eyes.

10  O beauty of the vales of Har. we live not for ourselves,

Thou seest me the meanest thing, and so I am indeed;

My bosom of itself is cold. and of itself is dark,



PLATE 5

But he that loves the lowly. pours his oil upon my head.

And kisses me, and binds his nuptial bands around my breast.

And says; Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee.

And I have given thee a crown that none can take away

But how this is sweet maid, I know not. and I cannot know,

I ponder. and I cannot ponder; yet I live and love.

The daughter of beauty wip’d her pitying tears with her  
white veil,

And said. Alas\! I knew not this, and therefore did I weep:

That God would love a Worm I knew. and punish the evil foot

10  That wilful, bruis’d its helpless form: but that he cherish’d it

With milk and oil, I never knew; and therefore did I weep.

And I complaind in the mild air, because I fade away.

And lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot.

Queen of the vales, the matron Clay answerd; I heard thy sighs,

And all thy moans flew o’er my roof. but I have call’d them down:

Wilt thou O Queen enter my house. ’tis given thee to enter,

And to return; fear nothing. enter with thy virgin feet.



PLATE 6

IV

The eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar:

Thel enter’d in & saw the secrets of the land unknown;

She saw the couches of the dead, & where the fibrous roots

Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists:

A land of sorrows & of tears where never smile was seen.

She wanderd in the land of clouds thro’ valleys dark, listning

Dolours & lamentations: waiting oft beside a dewy grave

She stood in silence. listning to the voices of the ground,

Till to her own grave plot she came. & there she sat down.

10  And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.

Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction?

Or the glistning Eye to the poison of a smile\!

Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn,

Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie?

Or an Eye of gifts & graces, show’ring fruits & coined gold\!

Why a Tongue impress’d with honey from every wind?

Why an Ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?

Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling & affright

Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy\!

10  Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire?

The Virgin started from her seat, & with a shriek.

Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har

The End



## **********TIRIEL**





1

And Aged Tiriel. stood before the Gates of his beautiful palace

\[*But dark were his once piercing eyes*\]

With Myratana. once the Queen of all the western plains

But now his eyes were darkned. & his wife fading in death

They stood before their once delightful palace. & thus the Voice

Of aged Tiriel. arose. that his sons might hear in their gates

Accursed race of Tiriel. behold your \[*aged*\] father

Come forth & look on her that bore you. come you accursed sons.

In my weak \[*aged*\] arms. I here have borne your dying mother

10  Come forth sons of the Curse come forth. see the death of

Myratana

His sons ran from their gates. & saw their aged parents stand

And thus the eldest son of Tiriel raisd his mighty voice

Old man unworthy to be calld. the father of Tiriels race

For evry one of those thy wrinkles. each of those grey hairs

Are cruel as death. & as obdurate as the devouring pit

Why should thy sons care for thy curses thou accursed man

Were we not slaves till we rebeld. Who cares for Tiriels curse

His blessing was a cruel curse. His curse may be a blessing

He ceast the aged man raisd up his right hand to the heavens

20  His left supported Myratana \[*living/ ?shriecking*\] shrinking in

pangs of death

The orbs of his large eyes he opend. & thus his voice went forth

Serpents not sons. wreathing around the bones of Tiriel

Ye worms of death feasting upon your aged parents flesh

Listen & hear your mothers groans. No more accursed Sons

She bears. she groans not at the birth of Heuxos or Yuva

These are the groans of death ye serpents. These are the groans of death

Nourished with milk ye serpents. nourishd with mothers tears & cares

Look at my eyes blind as the orbless scull among the stones

Look at my bald head. Hark listen ye serpents \[*all*\] listen

30 What Myratana. What my wife. O Soul O Spirit O fire

What Myratana. art thou dead. Look here ye serpents look

The serpents sprung from her own bowels have draind her dry as this

Curse on your ruthless heads. for I will bury her even here

So saying he began to dig a grave with his aged hands

But Heuxos calld a son of Zazel. to dig their mother a grave

Old cruelty desist & let us dig a grave for thee

Thou hast refusd our charity thou hast refusd our food

Thou hast refusd our clothes our beds our houses for thy dwelling

Chusing to wander like a Son of Zazel in the rocks

40  Why dost thou curse. is not the curse now come upon your head

Was it not you enslavd the sons of Zazel. & they have cursd

And now you feel it. Dig a grave & let us bury our mother

There take the body. cursed sons. & may the heavens rain wrath

As thick as northern fogs. around your gates. to choke you up

That you may lie as now your mother lies. like dogs. cast out

The stink. of your dead carcases annoying man & beast

Till your white bones are bleachd with age for a memorial.

No your remembrance shall perish. for when your carcases

Lie stinking on the earth. the buriers shall arise from the east

50  And. not a bone of all the sons of Tiriel remain

Bury your mother but you cannot bury the curse of Tiriel

He ceast & darkling oer the mountains sought his pathless way



2  
He wanderd day & night to him both day & night were dark

The sun he felt but the bright moon was now a useless globe

Oer mountains & thro vales of woe. the blind & aged man

Wanderd till he that leadeth all. led him to the vales of Har

And Har & Heva like two children sat beneath the Oak

Mnetha now aged waited on them. & brought them food & clothing

But they were as the shadow of Har. & as the years forgotten

Playing with flowers. & running after birds they spent the day

And in the night like infants slept delighted with infant dreams

10  Soon as the blind wanderer enterd the pleasant gardens of Har

\[*The aged father & mother saw him as they sat at play*\]

They ran weeping like frighted infants for refuge in Mnethas arms

The blind man felt his way & cried peace to these open doors

Let no one fear for poor blind Tiriel hurts none but himself

Tell me O friends where am I now. & in what pleasant place

This is the valley of Har said Mnetha & this the tent of Har

Who art thou poor blind man. that takest the name of Tiriel on thee

Tiriel is king of all the west. who art thou I am Mnetha

And this is Har & Heva. trembling like infants by my side

20  I know Tiriel is king of the west & there he lives in joy

No matter who I am O Mnetha. if thou hast any food

Give it me. for I cannot stay my journey is far from hence

Then Har said O my mother Mnetha venture not so near him

For he is the king of rotten wood & of the bones of death

He wanders. without eyes. & passes thro thick walls & doors

Thou shalt not smite my mother Mnetha O thou eyeless man

\[*O venerable O most piteous O most woeful day*\]

A wanderer. I beg for food. you see I cannot weep

\[*But I can kneel down at your door. I am a harmless man*\]

30  I cast away my staff the kind companion of my travel

And I kneel down that you may see I am a harmless man

He kneeled down & Mnetha said Come Har & Heva rise

He is an innocent old man & hungry with his travel

Then Har arose & laid his hand upon old Tiriels head

God bless thy poor bald pate. God bless. thy hollow winking eyes

God bless thy shriveld beard. God. bless. thy many wrinkled forehead

Thou hast no teeth old man & thus I kiss thy sleek bald head

Heva come kiss his bald head for he will not hurt us Heva

Then Heva came & took old Tiriel in her mothers arms

40  Bless thy poor eyes old man. & bless the old father of Tiriel

Thou art my Tiriels old father. I know thee thro thy wrinkles

Because thou smellest. like the figtree. thou smellest like ripe figs

How didst thou lose thy eyes old Tiriel. bless thy wrinkled face

\[*The aged Tiriel could not speak his heart was full of grief He strove against his rising passions. but still he could not speak*\]

Mnetha said come in aged wanderer tell us of thy name

Why shouldest thou conceal thyself from those of thine own flesh

I am not of this region. said Tiriel dissemblingly

\[*Fearing to tell him who he was. because of the weakness of Har*\]

50  I am an aged wanderer once father of a race

Far in the north. but they were wicked & were all destroyd

And I their father sent an outcast. I have told you all

Ask me no more I pray for grief hath seald my precious sight

O Lord said Mnetha how I tremble are there then more people

More human creatures on this earth beside the sons of Har

No more said Tiriel but I remain on all this globe

And I remain an outcast. hast thou any thing to drink

Then Mnetha gave him milk & fruits. & they sat down together



3  
They sat & eat & Har & Heva smild on Tiriel

Thou art a very old old man but I am older than thou

How came thine hair to leave thy forehead how came thy face so brown

My hair is very long my beard. doth cover all my breast

God bless thy piteous face. to count the wrinkles in thy face

Would puzzle Mnetha. bless thy face for thou art Tiriel

\[*Tiriel could scarce dissemble more* & *his tongue could scarce refrain*

*But still he feard that Har & Heva would die of joy & grief.*\]

Tiriel I never saw but once I sat with him & eat

10  He was as chearful as a prince & gave me entertainment

But long I staid not at his palace for I am forcd to wander

What wilt thou leave us too said Heva thou shalt not leave us too

For we have many sports to shew thee & many songs to sing

And after dinner we will walk into the cage of Har

And thou shalt help us to catch birds. & gather them ripe cherries

Then let thy name be Tiriel & never leave us more

If thou dost go said Har I wish thine eyes may see thy folly

My sons have left me did thine leave thee O twas very cruel

No venerable man said Tiriel ask me not such things

20  For thou dost make my heart to bleed my sons were not like thine

But worse O never ask me more or I must flee away

Thou shalt not go said Heva till thou hast seen our singing birds

And heard Har sing in the great cage & slept upon our fleeces

Go not for thou art so like Tiriel. that I love thine head

Tho it is wrinkled like the earth parchd with the summer heat

Then Tiriel rose up from the seat & said god bless these tents

\[*God bless my benefactors. for I cannot tarry longer*\]

My Journey is oer rocks & mountains. not in pleasant vales

I must not sleep nor rest because of madness & dismay

30   \[*Then Mnetha led him to the door & gave to him his staff*

*And Har & Heva stood & watchd him till he enterd the wood*

*And then they went & wept to Mnetha but they soon forgot their tears*\]

And Mnetha said Thou must not go to wander dark. alone

But dwell with us & let us be to thee instead of eyes

And I will bring thee food old man. till death shall call thee hence

Then Tiriel frownd & answerd. Did I not command you saying

Madness & deep dismay posses\[s\] the heart of the blind man

The wanderer who \[*runs*\] seeks the woods leaning upon his staff

Then Mnetha trembling at his frowns led him to the tent door

40  And gave to him his staff & blest him. he went on his way

But Har & Heva stood & watchd him till he enterd the wood

And then they went & wept to Mnetha. but they soon forgot their tears



4  
Over the weary hills the blind man took his lonely way

To him the day & night alike was dark & desolate

But far he had not gone when Ijim from his woods come down

Met him at entrance of the forest in a dark & lonely way

Who art thou Eyeless wretch that thus obstructst the lions path

Ijim shall rend thy feeble joints thou tempter of dark Ijim

Thou hast the form of Tiriel but I know thee well enough

Stand from my path foul fiend is this the last of thy deceits

To be a hypocrite & stand in shape of a blind beggar

10  The blind man heard his brothers voice & kneeld down on his knee

O brother Ijim if it is thy voice that speaks to me

Smite not thy brother Tiriel tho weary of his life

My sons have smitten me already. and if thou smitest me

The curse that rolls over their heads will rest itself on thine

Tis now seven years Since in my palace I beheld thy face

\[*Seven years of sorrow then the curse of Zazel*\]

Come thou dark fiend I dare thy cunning know that Ijim scorns

To smite the\[e\] in the form of helpless age & eyeless policy

Rise up for I discern thee & I dare thy eloquent tongue

20  Come I will lead thee on thy way & use thee as a scoff

O Brother Ijim thou beholdest wretched Tiriel

Kiss me my brother & then leave me to wander desolate

No artful fiend. but I will lead thee dost thou want to go

Reply not lest I bind thee with the green flags of the brook

Ay now thou art discoverd I will use thee like a slave

When Tiriel heard the words of Ijim he sought not to reply

He knew twas vain for Ijims words were as the voice of Fate

And they went on together over hills thro woody dales

Blind to the pleasures of the sight & deaf to warbling birds

30  All day they walkd & all the night beneath the pleasant Moon

Westwardly journeying till Tiriel grew weary with his travel

O Ijim I am faint & weary for my knees forbid

To bear me further. urge me not lest I should die with travel

A little rest I crave a little water from a brook

Or I shall soon discover that I am a mortal man

And you will lose your once lovd Tiriel alas how faint I am

Impudent fiend said Ijim hold thy glib & eloquent tongue

Tiriel is a king. & thou the tempter of dark Ijim

Drink of this running brook. & I will bear thee on my shoulders

40  He drank & Ijim raisd him up & bore him on his shoulders

All day he bore him & when evening drew her solemn curtain

Enterd the gates of Tiriels palace. & stood & calld aloud

Heuxos come forth I here have brought the fiend that troubles Ijim

Look knowst thou aught of this grey beard. or of these blinded eyes

Heuxos & Lotho ran forth at the sound of Ijims voice

And saw their aged father borne upon his mighty shoulders

Their eloquent tongues were dumb & sweat stood on their trembling limbs

They knew twas vain to strive with Ijim they bowd & silent stood

What Heuxos call thy father for I \[*must*\] mean to sport to night

50  This is the hypocrite that sometimes roars a dreadful lion

Then I have rent his limbs & left him rotting in the forest

For birds to eat but I have scarce departed from the place

But like a tyger he would come & so I rent him too

Then like a river he would seek to drown me in his waves

But soon I buffetted the torrent anon like to a cloud

Fraught with the swords of lightning. but I bravd the vengeance too

Then he would creep like a bright serpent till around my neck

While I was Sleeping he would twine I squeezd his poisnous soul

Then like a toad or like a newt. would whisper in my ears

60    Or like a rock stood in my way. or like a poisnous shrub

At last I caught him in the form of Tiriel blind & old

And so Ill keep him fetch your father forth Myratana

They stood confounded. and Thus Tiriel raisd his silver voice

Serpents not sons \[*you see and know your father*\] why do you stand fetch hither Tiriel

Fetch hither Myratana & delight yourselves with scoffs

For poor blind Tiriel is returnd & this much injurd head

Is ready for your bitter taunts. come forth sons of the curse

Mean time the other sons of Tiriel ran around their father

Confounded at the terrible strength of Ijim they knew twas vain

70  Both spear & shield were useless & the coat of iron mail

When Ijim stretchd his mighty arm. the arrow from his limbs

Rebounded & the piercing sword broke on his naked \[*limbs*\] flesh

\[*Then Ijim said Lotho. Clithyma. Makuth fetch your father*

*Why do you stand confounded thus. Heuxos why art thou silent*

*O noble Ijim thou hast brought our father to*\(*the gates*\) *our eyes*

*That we may tremble & repent before thy mighty knees*

*O we are but the slaves of Fortune. & that most cruel man*

*Desires our deaths. O Ijim \(tis one whose aged tongue*\)

\(*Decieve the noble & xxxx\) if the eloquent voice of Tiriel*

*Hath workd our ruin we submit nor strive against stern fate*

*He spoke & kneeld upon his knee. Then Ijim on the pavement*

*Set aged Tiriel. in deep thought whether these things were so*\]

Then is it true Heuxos that thou hast turnd thy aged parent

To be the sport of wintry winds. \(said Ijim\) is this true

It is a lie & I am \[*torn*\] like the tree torn by the wind

Thou eyeless fiend. & you dissemblers. Is this Tiriels house

It is as false \[*as*\] Matha. & as dark as vacant Orcus

Escape ye fiends for Ijim will not lift his hand against ye

So saying. Ijim gloomy turnd his back & silent sought

90  The \[*gloom*\] secret forests & all night wanderd in desolate ways



5  
And aged Tiriel stood & said where does the thunder sleep

Where doth he hide his terrible head & his swift & fiery daughters

Where do they shroud their fiery wings & the terrors of their hair

Earth thus I stamp thy bosom rouse the earthquake from his den

\[*Display thy*\] To raise his dark & burning visage thro the cleaving \[*world*\] ground

To thrust these towers with his shoulders. let his fiery dogs

Rise from the center belching flames & roarings. dark smoke

Where art thou Pestilence that bathest in fogs & standing lakes

Rise up thy sluggish limbs. & let the loathsomest of poisons

10  Drop from thy garments as thou walkest. wrapt in yellow

clouds

Here take thy seat. in this wide court. let it be strown with dead

And sit & smile upon these cursed sons of Tiriel

Thunder & fire & pestilence. here you not Tiriels curse

He ceast the heavy clouds confusd rolld round the lofty towers

Discharging their enormous voices. at the fathers curse

The earth trembled fires belched from the yawning clefts

And when the shaking ceast a fog possest the accursed clime

The cry was great in Tiriels palace his five daughters ran

And caught him by the garments weeping with cries of bitter woe

20  Aye now you feel the curse you cry. but may all ears be deaf

As Tiriels & all eyes as blind as Tiriels to your woes

May never stars shine on your roofs may never sun nor moon

Visit you but eternal fogs hover around your walls

Hela my youngest daughter you shall lead me from this place

And let the curse fall on the rest & wrap them up together

He ceast & Hela led her father from the noisom place

In haste they fled while all the sons & daughters of Tiriel

Chaind in thick darkness utterd cries of mourning all the night

And in the morning Lo an hundred men in ghastly death

30  The four daughters \[*& all the children in their silent beds*\]

stretchd on the marble pavement silent all

\[*And*\] falln by the pestilence the rest moped round in \[*ghastly*\] guilty fears

And all the children in their beds were cut off in one night

Thirty of Tiriels sons remaind. to wither in the palace

Desolate. Loathed. Dumb Astonishd waiting for black death



6  
And Hela led her father thro the silent of the night

Astonishd silent. till the morning beams began to spring

Now Hela I can go with pleasure & dwell with Har & Heva

Now that the curse shall clean devour all those guilty sons

This is the right & ready way I know it by the sound

That our feet make. Remember Hela I have savd thee from death

Then be obedient to thy father for the curse is taken off thee

I dwelt with Myratana five years in the desolate rock

And all that time we waited for the fire to fall from heaven

10  Or for the torrents of the sea to overwhelm you all

But now my wife is dead & all the time of grace is past

You see the parents curse. Now lead me where I have commanded

O Leagued with evil spirits thou accursed man of sin

True I was born thy \[*child*\] slave who askd thee to save me from death –

Twas for thy self thou cruel man because thou wantest eyes

True Hela this is the desert of all those cruel ones

Is Tiriel cruel look. his daughter & his youngest daughter

Laughs at affection glories in rebellion. scoffs at Love:–

I have not eat these two days lead me to Har & Hevas tent

20  Or I will wrap the\[e\] up in such a terrible fathers curse

That thou shalt feel worms in thy marrow creeping thro thy bones

Yet thou shalt lead me. Lead me I command to Har & Heva

O cruel O destroyer O consumer. O avenger

To Har & Heva I will lead thee then would that they would curse

Then would they curse as thou hast cursed but they are not like thee

O they are holy. & forgiving filld with loving mercy

Forgetting the offences of their most rebellious children

Or else thou wouldest not have livd to curse thy helpless children

Look on my eyes Hela & see for thou hast eyes to see

30  The tears swell from my stony fountains wherefore do I weep

Wherefore from my blind orbs art thou not siezd with poisnous stings

Laugh serpent youngest venomous reptile of the flesh of Tiriel

Laugh. for thy father Tiriel shall give the\[e\] cause to laugh

Unless thou lead me to the tent of Har child of the curse

Silence thy evil tongue thou murderer of thy helpless children

I lead thee to the tent of Har not that I mind thy curse

But that I feel they will curse thee & hang upon thy bones

Fell shaking agonies. & in each wrinkle of that face

Plant worms of death to feast upon the tongue of terrible curses

40  Hela my daughter listen. thou \[*child*\] art the daughter of Tiriel

Thy father calls. Thy father lifts his hand unto the \[*air*\] heavens

For thou hast laughed at my tears. & curst thy aged father

Let snakes rise from thy bedded locks & laugh among thy curls

He ceast her dark hair upright stood while snakes infolded round

Her madding brows. her shrieks appalld the soul of Tiriel

What have I done Hela my daughter fearst thou now the curse

Or wherefore dost thou cry Ah wretch to curse thy aged father

Lead me to Har & Heva & the curse of Tiriel

Shall *\(fall*\) fail. If thou refuse howl in the desolate mountains



7  
She howling led him over mountains & thro frighted vales

Till to the caves of Zazel they approachd at even tide

Forth from their caves \[*the sons of Zazel*\] old Zazel & his sons ran. \[&\] when they saw

Their tyrant prince blind & his daughter howling & leading him

They laughd & mocked some threw dirt & stones as they passd by

But when Tiriel turnd around & raisd his awful voice

\[*They fled away* \(& *hid themselves*\) *but some stood still & thus scoffing began*\]

Some fled away but Zazel stood still & thus began

Bald tyrant, wrinkled cunning \[*wretch*\] listen to Zazels chains

10  Twas thou that chaind thy brother Zazel where are now

thine eyes

Shout beautiful daughter of Tiriel. thou singest a sweet song

Where are you going. come & eat some roots & drink some water

Thy crown is bald old man. the sun will dry thy brains away

And thou wilt be as foolish as thy foolish brother Zazel

The blind man heard. & smote his breast & trembling passed on

They threw dirt after them. till to the covert of a wood

\[*They*\] The howling maiden led her father where wild beasts resort

Hoping to end her \[*life*\] woes. but from her cries the tygers fled

All night they wanderd thro the wood & when the sun arose

20  They enterd on the mountains of Har at Noon the happy tents

Were frighted by the dismal cries of Hela on the mountains

But Har & Heva slept fearless as babes. on loving breasts

Mnetha awoke she ran & stood at the tent door \[*in*\]& saw

The aged wanderer led towards the tents she took her bow

And ehose her arrows then advancd to meet the terrible pair



8  
And Mnetha hasted & met them at the gate of the lower garden

Stand still or from my bow recieve a sharp & winged death

Then Tiriel stood. saying what soft voice threatens such bitter things

Lead me to Har & Heva I am Tiriel King of the west

And Mnetha led them to the tent of Har. and Har & Heva

Ran to the door. when Tiriel felt the ankles of aged Har

He said. O weak mistaken father of a lawless race

Thy laws O Har & Tiriels wisdom end together in a curse

\[*Thy God of love thy heaven of joy*\]

10  Why is one law given to the lion & the \[*Ox*\] patient Ox

\[*Dost thou not see that men cannot be formed all alike*

*Some nostrild wide breathing out blood. Some close shut up*

*In silent deceit, poisons inhaling from the morning rose*

*With daggers hid beneath their lips & poison in their tongue*

*Or eyed with little sparks of Hell or with infernal brands*

*Flinging flames of discontent & plagues of dark despair*

*Or those whose mouths are graves whose teeth the gates of eternal death*

*Can wisdom be put in a silver rod or love in a golden bowl*

*Is the son of a king warmed without wool or does he cry with a voice*

20  *Of thunder does he look upon the sun & laugh or stretch*

*His little hands into the depths of the sea, to bring forth*

*The deadly cunning of the \(scaly tribe\) flatterer & spread it to the morning*\]

And why men bound beneath the heavens in a reptile form

A worm of sixty winters creeping on the dusky ground

The child springs from the womb. the father ready stands to form

The infant head while the mother idle plays with her dog on her couch

The young bosom is cold for lack of mothers nourishment & milk

Is cut off from the weeping mouth with difficulty & pain

The little lids are lifted & the little nostrils opend

The father forms a whip to rouze the sluggish senses to act

And scourges off all youthful fancies from the new-born  30 man

Then walks the weak infant in sorrow compelld to number footsteps

Upon the sand. &c

And when the \[*foolish crawling*\] drone has reachd his crawling length

Black berries appear that poison all around him. Such \[*is*\] was Tiriel

\[*Hypocrisy the idiots wisdom & the wise mans folly*\]

Compelld to pray repugnant & to humble the immortal spirit

Till I am subtil as a serpent in a paradise

Consuming all both flowers & fruits insects & warbling birds

And now my paradise is falln & a drear sandy plain

40  Returns my thirsty hissings in a curse on thee O Har

Mistaken father of a lawless race my voice is past

He ceast outstretchd at Har & Hevas feet in awful death



## ********SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND OF EXPERIENCE

Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul



### *******Songs of Innocence***

INTRODUCTION

Piping down the valleys wild  
Piping songs of pleasant glee  
On a cloud I saw a child.  
And he laughing said to me.

Pipe a song about a Lamb;  
So I piped with merry chear,  
Piper pipe that song again –  
So I piped, he wept to hear.

Drop thy pipe thy happy pipe

10   Sing thy songs of happy chear,

So I sung the same again  
While he wept with joy to hear

Piper sit thee down and write  
In a book that all may read –  
So he vanish’d from my sight.  
And I pluck’d a hollow reed.

And I made a rural pen,  
And I stain’d the water clear,  
And I wrote my happy songs

20   Every child may joy to hear

THE SHEPHERD

How sweet is the Shepherds sweet lot,  
From the morn to the evening he strays:  
He shall follow his sheep all the day  
And his tongue shall be filled with praise.

For he hears the lambs innocent call.  
And he hears the ewes tender reply.  
He is watchful while they are in peace.  
For they know when their Shepherd is nigh.

THE ECCHOING GREEN

The Sun does arise,  
And make happy the skies.  
The merry bells ring  
To welcome the Spring.  
The sky-lark and thrush,  
The birds of the bush,  
Sing louder around.  
To the bells chearful sound.  
While our sports shall be seen

10    On the Ecchoing Green.

Old John with white hair  
Does laugh away care,  
Sitting under the oak,  
Among the old folk,  
They laugh at our play,  
And soon they all say.  
Such such were the joys.  
When we all girls & boys,  
In our youth-time were seen,

20   On the Ecchoing Green.

Till the little ones weary  
No more can be merry  
The sun does descend.  
And our sports have an end:  
Round the laps of their mothers,  
Many sisters and brothers,  
Like birds in their nest,  
Are ready for rest;  
And sport no more seen,

30   On the darkening Green.

THE LAMB

   Little Lamb who made thee

   Dost thou know who made thee

Gave thee life & bid thee feed.  
By the stream & o’er the mead;  
Gave thee clothing of delight,  
Softest clothing wooly bright;  
Gave thee such a tender voice,  
Making all the vales rejoice:

          Little Lamb who made thee

10      Dost thou know who made thee

   Little Lamb I’ll tell thee,

   Little Lamb I’ll tell thee:

He is called by thy name,  
For he calls himself a Lamb:  
He is meek & he is mild,  
He became a little child:  
I a child & thou a lamb,  
We are called by his name.

          Little Lamb God bless thee.

20       Little Lamb God bless thee.

THE LITTLE BLACK BOY

My mother bore me in the southern wild,  
And I am black, but O\! my soul is white;  
White as an angel is the English child:  
But I am black as if bereav’d of light.

My mother taught me underneath a tree  
And sitting down before the heat of day,  
She took me on her lap and kissed me,  
And pointing to the east began to say.

Look on the rising sun: there God does live

10   And gives his light, and gives his heat away.

And flowers and trees and beasts and men recieve  
Comfort in morning joy in the noon day.

And we are put on earth a little space,  
That we may learn to bear the beams of love,  
And these black bodies and this sun-burnt face  
Is but a cloud, and like a shady grove.

For when our souls have learn’d the heat to bear  
The cloud will vanish we shall hear his voice.  
Saying: come out from the grove my love & care,

20   And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.

Thus did my mother say and kissed me,  
And thus I say to little English boy.  
When I from black and he from white cloud free,  
And round the tent of God like lambs we joy:

Ill shade him from the heat till he can bear,  
To lean in joy upon our fathers knee.  
And then I’ll stand and stroke his silver hair,  
And be like him and he will then love me.

THE BLOSSOM

Merry Merry Sparrow  
Under leaves so green  
A happy Blossom  
Sees you swift as arrow  
Seek your cradle narrow  
Near my Bosom.

Pretty Pretty Robin  
Under leaves so green  
A happy Blossom

10   Hears you sobbing sobbing

Pretty Pretty Robin  
Near my Bosom.

THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER

When my mother died I was very young,  
And my father sold me while yet my tongue,  
Could scarcely cry weep weep weep weep.  
So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep.

Theres little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head  
That curl’d like a lambs back, was shav’d, so I said.  
Hush Tom never mind it, for when your head’s bare,  
You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.

And so he was quiet, & that very night,

10   As Tom was a sleeping he had such a sight,

That thousands of sweepers Dick, Joe Ned & Jack  
Were all of them lock’d up in coffins of black

And by came an Angel who had a bright key,  
And he open’d the coffins & set them all free.  
Then down a green plain leaping laughing they run  
And wash in a river and shine in the Sun.

Then naked & white, all their bags left behind,  
They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind.  
And the Angel told Tom if he’d be a good boy,

20   He’d have God for his father & never want joy.

And so Tom awoke and we rose in the dark  
And got with our bags & our brushes to work.  
Tho’ the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm,  
So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.

THE LITTLE BOY LOST

Father, father, where are you going  
O do not walk so fast.  
Speak father, speak to your little boy  
Or else I shall be lost,

The night was dark no father was there  
The child was wet with dew.  
The mire was deep, & the child did weep  
And away the vapour flew.

THE LITTLE BOY FOUND

The little boy lost in the lonely fen,  
Led by the wand’ring light,  
Began to cry, but God ever nigh,  
Appeard like his father in white.

He kissed the child & by the hand led  
And to his mother brought,  
Who in sorrow pale, thro’ the lonely date  
Her little boy weeping sought.

LAUGHING SONG

When the green woods laugh, with the voice of joy  
And the dimpling stream runs laughing by,  
When the air does laugh with our merry wit,  
And the green hill laughs with the noise of it.

When the meadows laugh with lively green  
And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene,  
When Mary and Susan and Emily,  
With their sweet round mouths sing Ha, Ha, He.

When the painted birds laugh in the shade

10   Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread

Come live & be merry and join with me,  
To sing the sweet chorus of Ha, Ha, He.

A CRADLE SONG

Sweet dreams form a shade,  
O’er my lovely infants head.  
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.  
By happy silent moony beams.

Sweet sleep with soft down,  
Weave thy brows an infant crown.  
Sweet sleep Angel mild,  
Hover o’er my happy child.

Sweet smiles in the night,

10   Hover over my delight.

Sweet smiles Mothers smiles  
All the livelong night beguiles.

Sweet moans, dovelike sighs,  
Chase not slumber from thy eyes.  
Sweet moans, sweeter smiles.  
All the dovelike moans beguiles.

Sleep sleep happy child.  
All creation slept and smil’d.  
Sleep sleep happy sleep.

20   While o’er thee thy mother weep

Sweet babe in thy face,  
Holy image I can trace.  
Sweet babe once like thee,  
Thy maker lay and wept for me

Wept for me for thee for all.  
When he was an infant small.  
Thou his image ever see.  
Heavenly face that smiles on thee.

Smiles on thee on me on all,

30   Who became an infant small,

Infant smiles are his own smiles.  
Heaven & earth to peace beguiles.

THE DIVINE IMAGE

To Mercy Pity Peace and Love,  
All pray in their distress:  
And to these virtues of delight  
Return their thankfulness.

For Mercy Pity Peace and Love,  
Is God our father dear:  
And Mercy Pity Peace and Love,  
Is Man his child and care.

For Mercy has a human heart

10   Pity, a human face:

And Love, the human form divine,  
And Peace, the human dress.

Then every man of every clime,  
That prays in his distress,  
Prays to the human form divine  
Love Mercy Pity Peace.

And all must love the human form,  
In heathen, turk or jew.  
Where Mercy, Love & Pity dwell

20   There God is dwelling too.

HOLY THURSDAY

Twas on a Holy Thursday their innocent faces clean

The children walking two & two in red & blue & green

Grey headed beadles walkd before with wands as white as snow

Till into the high dome of Pauls they like Thames waters flow

O what a multitude they seemd these flowers of London town

Seated in companies they sit with radiance all their own

The hum of multitudes was there but multitudes of lambs

Thousands of little boys & girls raising their innocent hands

Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song

10  Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among

Beneath them sit the aged men wise guardians of the poor

Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door

NIGHT

The sun descending in the west  
The evening star does shine.  
The birds are silent in their nest,  
And I must seek for mine,  
The moon like a flower,  
In heavens high bower;  
With silent delight,  
Sits and smiles on the night.

Farewell green fields and happy groves,

10   Where flocks have took delight;

Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves  
The feet of angels bright;  
Unseen they pour blessing,  
And joy without ceasing,  
On each bud and blossom,  
And each sleeping bosom.

They look in every thoughtless nest,  
Where birds are coverd warm;  
They visit caves of every beast,

20   To keep them all from harm;

If they see any weeping,  
That should have been sleeping  
They pour sleep on their head  
And sit down by their bed.

When wolves and tygers howl for prey  
They pitying stand and weep;  
Seeking to drive their thirst away,  
And keep them from the sheep.  
But if they rush dreadful;

30   The angels most heedful,

Recieve each mild spirit,  
New worlds to inherit.

And there the lions ruddy eyes,  
Shall flow with tears of gold:  
And pitying the tender cries,  
And walking round the fold:  
Saying: wrath by his meekness  
And by his health, sickness,  
Is driven away,

40   From our immortal day.

And now beside thee bleating lamb,  
I can lie down and sleep;  
Or think on him who bore thy name,  
Grase after thee and weep.  
For wash’d in lifes river,  
My bright mane for ever.  
Shall shine like the gold.  
As I guard o’er the fold.

SPRING

Sound the Flute\!  
Now it’s mute.  
Birds delight  
Day and Night.  
Nightingale  
In the dale  
Lark in Sky  
Merrily  
Merrily Merrily to welcome in the Year

10   Little Boy

Full of joy.  
Little Girl  
Sweet and small,  
Cock does crow  
So do you.  
Merry voice  
Infant noise  
Merrily Merrily to welcome in the Year

Little Lamb

20   Here I am,

Come and lick  
My white neck.  
Let me pull  
Your soft Wool.  
Let me kiss  
Your soft face.  
Merrily Merrily we welcome in the Year

NURSE’S SONG

When the voices of children are heard on the green  
And laughing is heard on the hill,  
My heart is at rest within my breast  
And every thing else is still

Then come home my children, the sun is gone down  
And the dews of night arise  
Come come leave off play, and let us away  
Till the morning appears in the skies

No no let us play, for it is yet day

10   And we cannot go to sleep

Besides in the sky, the little birds fly  
And the hills are all covered with sheep

Well well go & play till the light fades away  
And then go home to bed  
The little ones leaped & shouted & laugh’d  
And all the hills ecchoed

INFANT JOY

I have no name  
I am but two days old. –  
What shall I call thee?  
I happy am  
Joy is my name, –  
Sweet joy befall thee\!

Pretty joy\!

10   Sweet joy but two days old.

Sweet joy I call thee:  
Thou dost smile.

I sing the while  
Sweet joy befall thee.



A DREAM

Once a dream did weave a shade,  
O’er my Angel-guarded bed,  
That an Emmet lost it’s way  
Where on grass methought I lay.

Troubled wilderd and folorn  
Dark benighted travel-worn,  
Over many a tangled spray  
All heart-broke I heard her say.

O my children\! do they cry

10   Do they hear their father sigh.

Now they look abroad to see,  
Now return and weep for me.

Pitying I drop’d a tear:  
But I saw a glow-worm near:  
Who replied. What wailing wight  
Calls the watchman of the night.

I am set to light the ground,  
While the beetle goes his round:  
Follow now the beetles hum,

20   Little wanderer hie thee home.

ON ANOTHERS SORROW

Can I see anothers woe,  
And not be in sorrow too.  
Can I see anothers grief,  
And not seek for kind relief.

Can I see a falling tear,  
And not feel my sorrows share,  
Can a father see his child,  
Weep, nor be with sorrow fill’d.

Can a mother sit and hear,

10   An infant groan an infant fear –

No no never can it be.  
Never never can it be.

And can he who smiles on all  
Hear the wren with sorrows small,  
Hear the small birds grief & care  
Hear the woes that infants bear –

And not sit beside the nest  
Pouring pity in their breast,  
And not sit the cradle near

20   Weeping tear on infants tear.

And not sit both night & day,  
Wiping all our tears away.  
O\! no never can it be.  
Never never can it be.

He doth give his joy to all.  
He becomes an infant small.  
He becomes a man of woe  
He doth feel the sorrow too.

Think not, thou canst sigh a sigh,

30   And thy maker is not by.

Think not, thou canst weep a tear,  
And thy maker is not near.

O\! he gives to us his joy,  
That our grief he may destroy  
Till our grief is fled & gone  
He doth sit by us and moan



### *******Songs of Experience***



INTRODUCTION

Hear the voice of the Bard\!  
Who Present, Past, & Future sees  
Whose ears have heard,  
The Holy Word,  
That walk’d among the ancient trees.

Calling the lapsed Soul  
And weeping in the evening dew:  
That might controll,  
The starry pole;

10   And fallen fallen light renew\!

O Earth O Earth return\!  
Arise from out the dewy grass;  
Night is worn,  
And the morn  
Rises from the slumberous mass.

Turn away no more:  
Why wilt thou turn away  
The starry floor  
The watry shore

20   Is giv’n thee till the break of day.

EARTH’S ANSWER

Earth rais’d up her head,  
From the darkness dread & drear.  
Her light fled:  
Stony dread\!  
And her locks cover’d with grey despair.

Prison’d on watry shore  
Starry Jealousy does keep my den  
Cold and hoar  
Weeping o’er

10   I hear the Father of the ancient men

Selfish father of men  
Cruel jealous selfish fear  
Can delight  
Chain’d in night  
The virgins of youth and morning bear.

Does spring hide its joy  
When buds and blossoms grow?  
Does the sower?  
Sow by night?

20   Or the plowman in darkness plow?

Break this heavy chain,  
That does freeze my bones around  
Selfish\! vain,  
Eternal bane\!  
That free Love with bondage bound.

THE CLOD & THE PEBBLE

Love seeketh not Itself to please,  
Nor for itself hath any care;  
But for another gives its ease,  
And builds a Heaven in Hells despair.

So sang a little Clod of Clay,  
Trodden with the cattles feet:  
But a Pebble of the brook,  
Warbled out these metres meet.

Love seeketh only Self to please,

10   To bind another to its delight;

Joys in anothers loss of ease,  
And builds a Hell in Heavens despite.

HOLY THURSDAY

Is this a holy thing to see,  
In a rich and fruitful land,  
Babes reduced to misery,  
Fed with cold and usurous hand?

Is that trembling cry a song?  
Can it be a song of joy?  
And so many children poor?  
It is a land of poverty\!

And their sun does never shine.

10   And their fields are bleak & bare.

And their ways are fill’d with thorns.  
It is eternal winter there.

For where-e’er the sun does shine,  
And where-e’er the rain does fall:  
Babe can never hunger there,  
Nor poverty the mind appall.

THE LITTLE GIRL LOST

In futurity  
I prophetic see,  
That the earth from sleep,  
\(Grave the sentence deep\)

Shall arise and seek  
For her maker meek:  
And the desart wild  
Become a garden mild.

In the southern clime,

10   Where the summers prime,

Never fades away;  
Lovely Lyca lay.

Seven summers old  
Lovely Lyca told.  
She had wanderd long,  
Hearing wild birds song.

Sweet sleep come to me  
Underneath this tree;  
Do father, mother weep. –

20  ‘Where can Lyca sleep’.

Lost in desart wild  
Is your little child.  
How can Lyca sleep,  
If her mother weep.

If her heart does ake,  
Then let Lyca wake;  
If my mother sleep,  
Lyca shall not weep.

Frowning frowning night,

30   O’er this desart bright,

Let thy moon arise,  
While I close my eyes.

Sleeping Lyca lay;  
While the beasts of prey,  
Come from caverns deep,  
View’d the maid asleep

The kingly lion stood  
And the virgin view’d,  
Then he gambold round

40   O’er the hallowd ground:

Leopards, tygers play,  
Round her as she lay;  
While the lion old,  
Bow’d his mane of gold.

And her bosom lick,  
And upon her neck,  
From his eyes of flame,  
Ruby tears there came;

While the lioness,

50   Loos’d her slender dress,

And naked they convey’d  
To caves the sleeping maid.

THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND

All the night in woe  
Lyca’s parents go:  
Over vallies deep,  
While the desarts weep.

Tired and woe-begone,  
Hoarse with making moan:  
Arm in arm seven days,  
They trac’d the desart ways.

Seven nights they sleep,

10   Among shadows deep:

And dream they see their child  
Starv’d in desart wild.

Pale thro pathless ways  
The fancied image strays,  
Famish’d, weeping, weak  
With hollow piteous shriek

Rising from unrest,  
The trembling woman prest,  
With feet of weary woe;

20   She could no further go.

In his arms he bore,  
Her arm’d with sorrow sore;  
Till before their way,  
A couching lion lay.

Turning back was vain,  
Soon his heavy mane,  
Bore them to the ground;  
Then he stalk’d around,

Smelling to his prey.

30   But their fears allay,

When he licks their hands;  
And silent by them stands.

They look upon his eyes  
Fill’d with deep surprise:  
And wondering behold,  
A spirit arm’d in gold.

On his head a crown  
On his shoulders down,  
Flow’d his golden hair.

40   Gone was all their care.

Follow me he said,  
Weep not for the maid;  
In my palace deep,  
Lyca lies asleep.

Then they followed,  
Where the vision led:  
And saw their sleeping child,  
Among tygers wild.

To this day they dwell

50   In a lonely dell

Nor fear the wolvish howl,  
Nor the lions growl.

THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER

A little black thing among the snow:  
Crying weep, weep. in notes of woe\!  
Where are thy father & mother? say?  
They are both gone up to the church to pray.

Because I was happy upon the heath.  
And smil’d among the winters snow:  
They clothed me in the clothes of death.  
And taught me to sing the notes of woe.

And because I am happy. & dance & sing.

10   They think they have done me no injury:

And are gone to praise God & his Priest & King  
Who make up a heaven of our misery.

NURSES SONG

When the voices of children, are heard on the green  
And whisperings are in the dale:  
The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,  
My face turns green and pale.

Then come home my children, the sun is gone down  
And the dews of night arise  
Your spring & your day, are wasted in play  
And your winter and night in disguise.

THE SICK ROSE

O Rose thou art sick.  
The invisible worm,  
That flies in the night  
In the howling storm:

Has found out thy bed  
Of crimson joy:  
And his dark secret love  
Does thy life destroy.



THE FLY

Little Fly  
Thy summers play,  
My thoughtless hand  
Has brush’d away.

Am not I  
A fly like thee?  
Or art not thou  
A man like me?

For I dance

10   And drink & sing;

Till some blind hand  
Shall brush my wing.

If thought is life  
And strength & breath;  
And the want  
Of thought is death;

Then am I  
A happy fly,  
If I live,

20   Or if I die.



THE ANGEL

I Dreamt a Dream\! what can it mean?  
And that I was a maiden Queen:  
Guarded by an Angel mild;  
Witless woe, was ne’er beguil’d\!

And I wept both night and day  
And he wip’d my tears away  
And I wept both day and night  
And hid from him my hearts delight

So he took his wings and fled:

10   Then the morn blush’d rosy red:

I dried my tears & armd my fears,  
With ten thousand shields and spears.

Soon my Angel came again:  
I was arm’d, he came in vain:  
For the time of youth was fled  
And grey hairs were on my head.



THE TYGER

Tyger Tyger, burning bright,  
In the forests of the night:  
What immortal hand or eye,  
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

In what distant deeps or skies  
Burnt the fire of thine eyes\!  
On what wings dare he aspire?  
What the hand, dare sieze the fire?

And what shoulder, & what art,

10   Could twist the sinews of thy heart?

And when thy heart began to beat,  
What dread hand? & what dread feet?

What the hammer? what the chain,  
In what furnace was thy brain?  
What the anvil? what dread grasp,  
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

When the stars threw down their spears  
And water’d heaven with their tears:  
Did he smile his work to see?

20   Did he who made the Lamb make thee?

Tyger, Tyger burning bright,  
In the forests of the night:  
What immortal hand or eye,  
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

MY PRETTY ROSE TREE

A flower was offerd to me;  
Such a flower as May never bore.  
But I said I’ve a Pretty Rose-tree.  
And I passed the sweet flower o’er.

Then I went to my Pretty Rose-tree;  
To tend her by day and by night.  
But my Rose turned away with jealousy:  
And her thorns were my only delight.



AH\! SUN-FLOWER

Ah Sun-flower\! weary of time.  
Who countest the steps of the Sun:  
Seeking after that sweet golden clime  
Where the travellers journey is done.

Where the Youth pined away with desire,  
And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow:  
Arise from their graves and aspire,  
Where my Sun-flower wishes to go.



THE LILLY

The modest Rose puts forth a thorn:  
The humble Sheep, a threatning horn:  
While the Lilly white, shall in Love delight,  
Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright

THE GARDEN OF LOVE

I went to the Garden of Love.  
And saw what I never had seen:  
A Chapel was built in the midst,  
Where I used to play on the green.

And the gates of this Chapel were shut,  
And Thou shalt not. writ over the door;  
So I turn’d to the Garden of Love,  
That so many sweet flowers bore.

And I saw it was filled with graves,

10   And tomb-stones where flowers should be:

And Priests in black gowns, were walking their rounds,  
And binding with briars, my joys & desires.

THE LITTLE VAGABOND

Dear Mother, dear Mother, the Church is cold.  
But the Ale-house is healthy & pleasant & warm;  
Besides I can tell where I am use’d well,  
Such usage in heaven will never do well.

But if at the Church they would give us some Ale.  
And a pleasant fire, our souls to regale;  
We’d sing and we’d pray, all the live-long day;  
Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray,

Then the Parson might preach & drink & sing.

10   And we’d be as happy as birds in the spring:

And modest dame Lurch, who is always at Church,  
Wou’ld not have bandy children nor fasting nor birch.

And God like a father rejoicing to see,  
His children as pleasant and happy as he:  
Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the Barrel  
But kiss him & give him both drink and apparel.

LONDON

I wander thro’ each charter’d street,  
Near where the charter’d Thames does flow.  
And mark in every face I meet  
Marks of weakness, marks of woe.

In every cry of every Man,  
In every Infants cry of fear,  
In every voice: in every ban,  
The mind-forg’d manacles I hear

How the Chimney-sweepers cry

10   Every blackning Church appalls,

And the hapless Soldiers sigh,  
Runs in blood down Palace walls

But most thro’ midnight streets I hear  
How the youthful Harlots curse  
Blasts the new-born Infants tear  
And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse



THE HUMAN ABSTRACT

Pity would be no more,  
If we did not make somebody Poor:  
And Mercy no more could be,  
If all were as happy as we;

And mutual fear brings peace;  
Till the selfish loves increase.  
Then Cruelty knits a snare,  
And spreads his baits with care.

He sits down with holy fears,

10   And waters the ground with tears:

Then Humility takes its root  
Underneath his foot.

Soon spreads the dismal shade  
Of Mystery over his head;  
And the Catterpiller and Fly,  
Feed on the Mystery.

And it bears the fruit of Deceit,  
Ruddy and sweet to eat;  
And the Raven his nest has made

20   In its thickest shade.

The Gods of the earth and sea,  
Sought thro’ Nature to find this Tree  
But their search was all in vain:  
There grows one in the Human Brain



INFANT SORROW

My mother groand\! my father wept.  
Into the dangerous world I leapt:  
Helpless, naked, piping loud;  
Like a fiend hid in a cloud.

Struggling in my fathers hands:  
Striving against my swadling bands:  
Bound and weary I thought best  
To sulk upon my mothers breast.



A POISON TREE

I was angry with my friend:  
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.  
I was angry with my foe:  
I told it not, my wrath did grow.

And I watered it in fears.  
Night & morning with my tears:  
And I sunned it with smiles.  
And with soft deceitful wiles.

And it grew both day and night.

10   Till it bore an apple bright.

And my foe beheld it shine.  
And he knew that it was mine.

And into my garden stole.  
When the night had veild the pole;  
In the morning glad I see;  
My foe outstretchd beneath the tree.



A LITTLE BOY LOST

Nought loves another as itself  
Nor venerates another so.  
Nor is it possible to Thought  
A greater than itself to know:

And Father, how can I love you,  
Or any of my brothers more?  
I love you like the little bird  
That picks up crumbs around the door.

The Priest sat by and heard the child.

10   In trembling zeal he siez’d his hair:

He led him by his little coat:  
And all admir’d the Priestly care.

And standing on the altar high,  
Lo what a fiend is here\! said he:  
One who sets reason up for judge  
Of our most holy Mystery.

The weeping child could not be heard.  
The weeping parents wept in vain:  
They strip’d him to his little shirt.

20   And bound him in an iron chain.

And burn’d him in a holy place,  
Where many had been burn’d before:  
The weeping parents wept in vain.  
Are such things done on Albions shore.



A LITTLE GIRL LOST

   *Children of the future Age,*

*Reading this indignant page:  
Know that in a former time,  
Love\! sweet Love\! was thought a crime*.

In the Age of Gold,  
Free from winters cold:  
Youth and maiden bright,  
To the holy light,  
Naked in the sunny beams delight.

10  Once a youthful pair

Fill’d with softest care:  
Met in garden bright,  
Where the holy light,  
Had just remov’d the curtains of the night.

There in rising day,  
On the grass they play:  
Parents were afar:  
Strangers came not near:  
And the maiden soon forgot her fear.

20  Tired with kisses sweet

They agree to meet,  
When the silent sleep  
Waves o’er heavens deep;  
And the weary tired wanderers weep.

To her father white  
Came the maiden bright:  
But his loving look.  
Like the holy book,  
All her tender limbs with terror shook.

Ona\! pale and weak\!  
To thy father speak:  
O the trembling fear\!  
O the dismal care\!  
That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair



TO TIRZAH

Whate’er is Born of Mortal Birth,  
Must be consumed with the Earth  
To rise from Generation free;  
Then what have I to do with thee?

The Sexes sprung from Shame & Pride  
Blow’d in the morn: in evening died  
But Mercy changd Death into Sleep;  
The Sexes rose to work & weep.

Thou Mother of my Mortal part

10   With cruelty didst mould my Heart,

And with false self-decieving tears,  
Didst bind my Nostrils Eyes & Ears.

Didst close my Tongue in senseless clay  
And me to Mortal Life betray:  
The Death of Jesus set me free,  
Then what have I to do with thee?



THE SCHOOL BOY

I love to rise in a summer morn,  
When the birds sing on every tree;  
The distant huntsman winds his horn,  
And the sky-lark sings with me.  
O\! what sweet company.

But to go to school in a summer morn  
O\! it drives all joy away;  
Under a cruel eye outworn,  
The little ones spend the day,

10   In sighing and dismay.

Ah\! then at times I drooping sit,  
And spend many an anxious hour.  
Nor in my book can I take delight,  
Nor sit in learnings bower,  
Worn thro’ with the dreary shower

How can the bird that is born for joy,  
Sit in a cage and sing.  
How can a child when fears annoy,  
But droop his tender wing,

20   And forget his youthful spring.

O\! father & mother, if buds are nip’d,  
And blossoms blown away,  
And if the tender plants are strip’d  
Of their joy in the springing day,  
By sorrow and cares dismay,

How shall the summer arise in joy  
Or the summer fruits appear  
Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy  
Or bless the mellowing year,

30   When the blasts of winter appear.



THE VOICE OF THE ANCIENT BARD

Youth of delight come hither:  
And see the opening morn,  
Image of truth new born  
Doubt is fled & clouds of reason  
Dark disputes & artful teazing.  
Folly is an endless maze,  
Tangled roots perplex her ways,  
How many have fallen there\!  
They stumble all night over bones of the dead;

10  And feel they know not what but care;

And wish to lead others when they should be led.



## ********NOTEBOOK POEMS AND FRAGMENTS, ***c***. 1789–93





A flower was offerd to me  
Such a flower as may never bore  
But I said Ive a pretty rose tree  
And I passed the sweet flower oer

Then I went to my pretty rose tree  
\[*In the silent of the night*\]  
To tend it by day & by night  
But my rose \[*was turnd from me/was filld*\] turnd away with Jealousy  
And her thorns were my only delight

\*

\[*Never* \(*seek*\) *pain to tell thy love  
Love that never told can be  
For the gentle wind does move  
Silently invisibly*\]

I told my love I told my love  
I told her all my heart  
Trembling cold in ghastly fears  
Ah she doth depart

Soon as she was gone from me  
A traveller came by  
Silently invisibly  
\[*He took her with a sigh*\]  
O was no deny

\*

Love seeketh not itself to please  
Nor for itself hath any care  
But for another gives its ease  
And builds a heaven in hells despair

So sung a little clod of clay  
Trodden with the cattles feet  
But a pebble of the brook  
Warbled out these metres meet

Love seeketh only self to please  
To bind another to its delight  
Joys in anothers loss of ease  
And builds a hell in heavens despite

\*

I laid me down upon a bank  
Where love lay sleeping  
I heard among the rushes dank  
Weeping Weeping

Then I went to the heath & the wild  
To the thistles & thorns of the waste  
And they told me how they were beguild  
Driven out & compeld to be chaste

\*

I went to the garden of love  
And I saw what I never had seen  
A chapel was built in the midst  
Where I used to play on the green

And the gates of the chapel were shut  
And thou shalt not writ over the door  
\[*And*\] So I turned to the garden of love  
That so many sweet flowers bore

And I saw it was filled with graves

10   And tomb-stones where flowers should be

And priests in black gounds were walking their rounds  
And binding with briars my joys & desires

\*

I saw a chapel all of gold  
That none did dare to enter in  
And many weeping stood without  
Weeping mourning worshipping

I saw a serpent rise between  
The white pillars of the door  
And he forcd & forcd & forcd  
\[*Till he broke the pearly door*\]  
Down the golden hinges tore

10   And along the pavement sweet

Set with pearls & rubies bright  
All his slimy length he drew  
Till upon the altar white

Vomiting his poison out  
On the bread & on the wine  
So I turned into a sty  
And laid me down among the swine

\*

I asked a thief \[*if he’d*\] to steal me a peach  
\[*And*\] He turned up his eyes  
I askd a lithe lady to lie her down  
\[*And*\] Holy & meek she cries

As soon as I went An angel came  
\[*And*\] He winkd at the thief  
And \[*he*\] smild at the dame

And without one word \[*spoke*\] said

10   Had a peach from the tree

\[*And twixt earnest &* \(*game*\) *joke*\] And still as a maid  
\[*He*\] Enjoy’d the \[*da*\] lady.

\*

I heard an Angel singing  
When the day was springing  
Mercy Pity \[&\] Peace  
Is the worlds release

Thus he sung all day  
Over the new mown hay  
Till the sun went down  
And haycocks looked brown

I heard a Devil curse

10   Over the heath & the furze

Mercy could be no more  
If there was nobody poor

And pity no more could be  
If all were as happy as we  
\[*Thus he sang &*\] At his curse the sun went down  
And the heavens gave a frown

\[\(*And*\) *Down pourd the heavy rain  
Over the new reapd grain  
And Mercy & Pity & Peace descended*

20   *The Farmers were ruind & harvest was ended*\]

\[*And Mercy Pity & Peace*      \[*And by distress increase*

*Joyd at their increase*            *Mercy Pity Peace*

*With Povertys Increase*          *By Misery to increase*

*Are*\]                                   *mercy Pity Peace*\]

And Miseries increase  
Is Mercy Pity Peace

A CRADLE SONG

1    3  Sleep Sleep; in thy sleep  
         \[*Thou wilt every secret keep*\]  
        \[*Canst*\] \[*Thou canst any secret keep*\]

      4    Little sorrows sit *&* weep

      1    Sleep Sleep beauty bright  
          \[*Thou shalt taste the joys of night*\]

      2    Dreaming oer the joys of night  
          \[*Yet a little while the moon Silent*\]

10   3 As thy softest limbs I \[*touch/stroke*\] feel

Smiles as of the morning \[*broke*\] steal  
Oer thy cheek & oer thy breast  
Where thy little heart does rest

4      O the cunning wiles that creep

In thy little heart asleep  
When thy little heart does wake  
Then the dreadful lightnings break

2     Sweet Babe in thy face

20   Soft desires I can trace

Secret joys & secret smiles  
\[*Such as burning youth beguiles*\]  
Little pretty infant wiles

5      From thy cheek & from thy eye

Oer the youthful harvests nigh  
\[*Female*\] Infant wiles & \[*female*\] infant smiles  
Heaven & Earth of peace beguiles

CHRISTIAN FORBEARANCE

I was angry with my friend  
I told my wrath my wrath did end  
I was angry with my foe  
I told it not my wrath did grow

And I waterd it in fears  
Night & morning with my tears  
And I sunned it with smiles  
And with soft deceitful wiles

And it grew by day & night

10   Till it bore an apple bright

\[*And I gave it to my foe*\]  
And my foe beheld it shine  
And he knew that it was mine

And into my garden stole  
When the night had veild the pole  
In the morning Glad I see  
My foe outstretchd beneath the tree

\*

I feard the \[*roughness*\] fury of my wind  
Would blight all blossoms fair & true  
And my sun it shind & shind  
And my wind it never blew

But a blossom fair or true  
Was not found on any tree  
For all blossoms grew & grew  
Fruitless false tho fair to see

\*

\[*THAMES*\]

Why should I care for the men of thames  
Or the cheating waves of charterd streams  
Or shrink at the little blasts of fear  
That the hireling blows into my ear

Tho born on the cheating banks of Thames  
Tho his waters bathed my infant limbs  
\[*I spurnd his waters away from me*\]  
The Ohio shall wash his stains from me  
I was born a slave but I \[*long*\] go to be free

\*

INFANT SORROW

My mother groand my father wept  
Into the dangerous world I leapt  
Helpless naked piping loud  
Like a fiend hid in a cloud

Struggling in my fathers hands  
Striving against my swaddling bands  
Bound & weary I thought best  
To sulk upon my mothers breast

When I saw that rage was vain

10   And to sulk would nothing gain

\[*I began to so/Seeking many an artful wile*\]  
Turning many a trick or wile  
I began to soothe & smile

And I \[*grew/smild*\] soothd day after day  
Till upon the ground I stray  
And I \[*grew*\] smild night after night  
Seeking only for delight

\[*But upon the nettly ground*

20   *No delight was to be found*\]  
      And I saw before me shine

Clusters of the wandring vine  
\[*And beyond a mirtle tree*\]  
And many a lovely flower and tree  
Stretchd \[*its*\] their blossoms out to me

\[*But a Priest/But many a*\] My father then with holy look  
In \[*his/their*\] hands a holy book  
Pronouncd curses on \[*his*\] my head  
\[*Who the fruit or blossoms shed*\]  
And bound me in a mirtle shade

30   \[*I beheld the* \(*Priest*\) *Priests by night*

\(*He*\) *They embracd* \(*my mirtle*\) *the blossoms bright  
Like a serpent in the*\] Like to holy men by day  
Underneath \[*my*\] the vines \[*he*\] they lay

So I smote \[*him*\] them & \[*his*\] their gore  
Staind the roots my mirtle bore  
But the time of youth is fled  
And grey hairs are on my head

\*

Silent Silent Night  
Quench the holy light  
Of thy torches bright

For possessd of Day  
Thousand spirits stray  
That sweet joys betray

Why should joys be sweet

10   Used with deceit

Nor with sorrows meet

But an honest joy  
Does itself destroy  
For a harlot coy

\*

O lapwing thou fliest around the heath  
Nor seest the net that is spread beneath  
Why dost thou not fly among the corn fields  
They cannot spread nets where a harvest yields

\*

Thou hast a lap full of seed  
And this is a fine country  
Why dost thou not cast thy seed  
And live in it merrily

\[*Oft Ive*\] Shall I cast it on the sand  
And \[*turnd*\] turn it into fruitful land  
\[*But*\] For on no other ground  
Can I sow my seed

10   Without \[*pulling*\] tearing up

Some stinking weed

\*



\[*THE*\] EARTHS ANSWER

Earth raisd up her head  
From the darkness dread & drear  
Her \[*eyes/orbs*\] \[*fled/dead*\] light fled  
Stony dread;  
And her locks coverd with grey despair:

Prisond on watry shore  
Starry Jealousy does keep my den  
Cold & hoar  
Weeping oer

10    I hear the \[*father of the*\] ancient \[*father of*\] men

\[\(*Cruel*\) *Selfish father of men*

*Cruel jealous* \(*wintry*\) *selfish fear  
Can delight  
\(Closd\) Chaind in night  
The virgins of youth & morning bear*\]

Does spring hide its \[*delight*\] joy  
When buds & blossoms grow  
Does the sower \[*sow  
His seed*\] Sow by night

20   Or the plowman in darkness plow

Break this heavy chain  
That does \[*close*\]  
freeze my bones around  
Selfish vain  
\[*Thou my*\] Eternal bane  
\[*Hast my*\] That free love with bondage bound

\*



IN A MIRTLE SHADE

\[*To a lovely mirtle bound  
Blossoms showring all around*\]

2     O how sick & weary I

Underneath my mirtle lie

Like to dung upon the ground  
Underneath my mirtle bound

1   Why should I be bound to thee

O my lovely mirtle tree  
Love free love cannot be bound

10   To any tree that grows on ground

3     Oft my mirtle sighd in vain

To behold my heavy chain  
Oft \[*the priest beheld*\] my father saw us sigh  
And laughd at our simplicity

So I smote him & his gore  
Staind the roots my mirtle bore  
But the time of youth is fled  
And grey hairs are on my head

\*



LONDON

I wander thro each dirty street  
Near where the dirty Thames does flow  
And \[*see*\] mark in every face I meet  
Marks of weakness marks of woe

In every cry of every man  
In \[*every voice of every child*\] every infants cry of fear  
In every voice in every ban  
The \[*german forged links*\] mind forgd manacles I hear

\[*But most*\] How the chimney sweepers cry

10   \[*Blackens oer the churches walls*\]

Every blackning church appalls  
And the hapless soldiers sigh  
Runs in blood down palace walls

\[*But most the midnight harlots curse  
From every dismal street I hear  
Weaves around the marriage hearse  
And blasts the newborn infants tear*\]

But most \[*from every*\] thro wintry streets I hear

20   How the midnight harlots curse

Blasts the newborn infants tear

And \[*hangs*\] smites with plagues the marriage hearse

But most the shrieks of youth I hear  
But most thro midnight &c  
How the youthful

\*



TO NOBODADDY

Why art thou silent & invisible  
\[*Man*\] Father of Jealousy  
Why dost thou hide thyself in clouds  
From every searching Eye

Why darkness & obscurity  
In all thy words & laws  
That none dare eat the fruit but from  
The wily serpents jaws  
Or is it because secresy gains \[*feminine*\] females loud applause

\*

The \[*rose puts envious*\] \[*lustful*\] modest rose puts forth a thorn  
The \[*coward*\] humble sheep a threatning horn  
While the lilly white shall in love delight  
\[*And the lion increase freedom & peace*\]  
\[*The prist loves war & the soldier peace*\]  
Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright

\*

When the voices of children are heard on the green  
And whisprings are in the dale  
The \[*desires*\] days of my youth rise fresh in my mind  
My face turns green & pale

Then come home my children the sun is gone down  
And the dews of night arise  
Your spring & your day are wasted in play  
And your winter & night in disguise

\*

Are not the joys of morning sweeter  
Than the joys of night  
And are the vigrous joys of youth  
Ashamed of the light

Let age & sickness silent rob  
The vineyards in the night  
But those who burn with vigrous youth  
Pluck fruits before the light

In the forests of the night  
What immortal hand \[*&*\] or eye  
\[*Could/Dare*\] frame thy fearful symmetry

2     \[*In what/Burnt in*\] distant deeps or skies

\[*Burnt the/The cruel*\] fire of thine eyes  
On what wings dare he aspire  
What the hand dare sieze the fire

3    And what shoulder & what art

10    Could twist the sinews of thy heart

And when thy heart began to beat  
What dread hand & what dread feet

\[*Could fetch it from the furnace deep  
And in \(the\) thy horrid ribs dare steep  
In the well of sanguine woe  
In what clay & in what mould  
Were thy eyes of fury rolld*\]

4     \[*What/Where*\] the hammer \[*what/where*\] the chain

In what furnace was thy brain  
What the anvil what \[*the arm/grasp/clasp*\] dread grasp 20  
\[*Could*\] Dare its deadly terrors \[*clasp/grasp*\] clasp

In thee forests of the night  
What immortal hand & eye  
Dare\[*form*\] frame thy fearful symmetry

5  3  And \[*did he laugh*\] dare he \[*smile/laugh*\] his work to see

\[*What the shoulder* \(*ankle*\) *what the knee*\]

    4  \[*Did*\] Dare he who made the lamb make thee

30 1  When the stars threw down their spears

    2  And waterd heaven with their tears



\[SECOND VERSION\]

Tyger Tyger burning bright  
In the forests of the night  
What Immortal hand \[*or*\] & eye  
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry

Burnt in distant deeps or skies  
The cruel fire of thine eyes  
Could heart descend or wings aspire  
What the hand dare sieze the fire

And what shoulder & what art

10   Could twist the sinews of thy heart

And when thy heart began to beat  
What dread hand & what dread feet

When the stars threw down their spears  
And waterd heaven with their tears  
Did he smile his work to see  
Did he who made the lamb make thee

Tyger Tyger burning bright  
In the forests of the night  
What immortal hand & eye  
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry

\*

\[*How came pride in Man  
From Mary it began  
How Contempt & Scorn  
What a world is Man  
His Earth*\]

\*



THE HUMAN IMAGE

\[*Mercy*\] Pity could be no more  
\[*If there was nobody poor*\]  
If we did not make somebody poor  
And Mercy no more could be  
If all were as happy as we

And mutual fear brings Peace  
Till the selfish Loves increase  
Then Cruelty knits a snare  
And spreads his \[*nets*\] baits with care

10   He sits down with holy fears

And waters the ground with tears  
Then humility takes its root  
Underneath his foot

Soon spreads the dismal shade  
Of Mystery over his head  
And the caterpillar & fly  
Feed on the Mystery

And it bears the fruit of deceit  
Ruddy & sweet to eat  
And the raven his nest has made

20   In its thickest shade

The Gods of the Earth & Sea  
Sought thro nature to find this tree  
But their search was all in vain  
\[*Till they sought in the human brain*\]  
There grows one in the human brain  
They said this mystery never shall cease  
The prest \[*loves*\] promotes war and the soldier peace

There souls of men are bought & sold

30   And \[*cradled*\] milk fed infancy \[*is sold*\] for gold

And youth\[*s*\] to slaughter houses led  
And \[*maidens*\] beauty for a bit of bread

\*



\[*HOW TO KNOW LOVE FROM DECEIT*\]

Love to faults is always blind  
Always is to joy inclind  
\[*Always*\] Lawless wingd & unconfind  
And breaks all chains from every mind

Deceit to secresy \[*inclind*\] confind  
\[*Modest prudish & confind*\]  
Lawful cautious \[*changeful and*\] & refind  
\[*Never is to*\] To every thing but interest blind  
\[*And chains & fetters every mind*\]  
And forges fetters for the mind

THE WILD FLOWERS SONG

As I wanderd the forest  
The green leaves among  
I heard a wild \[*thistle*\] flower  
Singing a song

I \[*mas found*\] slept in the \[*dark*\] Earth  
In the silent night  
I murmurd my fears  
And I felt delight

In the morning I went

10   As rosy as morn

To seek for new Joy  
But I met with scorn

\*



THE SICK ROSE

O Rose thou art sick  
The invisible worm  
That flies in the night  
In the howling storm

Hath found out thy bed  
Of crimson joy  
\[*O dark secret love  
Doth life destroy*\]  
And \[*his*\] her dark secret love  
Does thy life destroy

\*



SOFT SNOW

I walked abroad in a snowy day  
I askd the soft snow with me to play  
She playd & she melted in all her prime  
\[*Ah that sweet love should be thought a crime*\]  
And the winter calld it a dreadful crime

\*



AN ANCIENT PROVERB

Remove away that blackning church  
Remove away that marriage hearse  
Remove away that \[*place*\] man of blood  
\[*Twill*\] Youll quite remove the ancient curse

TO MY MIRTLE

 5    Why should I be bound to thee

 6    O my lovely mirtle tree

       \[*Love free love cannot be bound*

       *To any tree that grows on ground*\]

 1     To a lovely mirtle bound

 2     Blossoms showring all around

       \[*Like to dung upon the ground*

Underneath my mirtle bound\]

 3     O how sick & weary I

10 4     Underneath my mirtle lie

Naught loves another as itself  
Nor venerates another so  
Nor is it possible to Thought  
A greater than itself to know

\[*Nor*\] Or any of my brothers more  
I love \[*myself so does the bird*\] you like the little bird  
That picks up crumbs around the door

The Priest sat by and heard the child

10   In trembling zeal he seizd his hair

\[*The mother followed weeping loud  
O that I such a fiend should bear  
Then*\] He led him by the little coat  
\[*To show his zealous priestly care*\]  
And all admird his priestly care

And standing on the altar high  
Lo what a fiend is here said he  
One who sets reason up for judge  
Of our most holy mystery

20   The weeping child could not be heard

The weeping parents wept in vain  
\[*They bound his little ivory limbs  
In a cruel Iron chain  
And*\] They strip’d him to his little shirt  
& bound him in an iron chain

\[*They*\] And burnd him in a holy \[*fire*\] place  
Where many had been burnd before  
The weeping parents wept in vain  
Are Such things \[*are*\] done on Albions shore

THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER

A little black thing among the snow  
Crying weep weep in notes of woe  
Where are thy father & mother say  
They are both gone up to Church to pray

Because I was happy upon the heath  
And smild among the winters \[*wind*\] snow  
They clothd me in the clothes of death  
And taught me to sing the notes of woe

And because I am happy and dance and sing

10    They think they have done me no injury

And are gone to praise God & his Priest & King  
\[*Who wrap themselves up in our misery*\]  
Who make up a heaven of our misery

\*



MERLINS PROPHECY

The harvest shall flourish in wintry weather  
When two virginities meet together  
The King & the Priest must be tied in a tether  
Before two virgins can meet together

\[*THE MARRIAGE RING*\] THE FAIRY

Come hither my sparrows  
My little arrows  
If a tear or a smile  
Will a man beguile  
If an amorous delay  
Clouds a sunshiny day  
If the \[*tread*\] step of a foot  
Smites the heart to its root  
Tis the marriage ring

10    Makes each fairy a king

So a fairy sung  
From the leaves I sprung  
He leapd from the spray  
To flee away  
\[*And*\] But in my hat caught  
He soon shall be taught  
Let him laugh let him cry  
Hes my butterfly  
\[*And a marriage ring  
Is a foolish thing/Is a childs play thing*\]  
For I’ve pulld out the Sting  
Of the marriage ring

But could not make the sickle yield

But Desire Gratified  
Plants fruits of life & beauty there

\*

In a wife I would desire  
What in whores is always found  
The lineaments of Gratified desire

\*

If you \[*catch*\] trap the moment before its ripe  
The tears of repentance youll certainly wipe  
But if once you let the ripe moment go  
You\[*ll*\] can never wipe off the tears of woe

THE LITTLE \[*A PRETTY*\] VAGABOND

Dear Mother Dear Mother the church is cold  
But the alehouse is healthy & pleasant & warm  
Besides I can tell where I am usd well  
\[*Such usage in heaven makes us all go to hell*\]  
The poor parsons with wind like a blown bladder swell

But if at the Church they would give us some Ale  
And a pleasant fire our souls to regale  
We’d sing and we’d pray all the livelong day  
Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray

10   Then the parson might preach & drink & sing

And wed be as happy as birds in the spring  
And Modest dame Lurch who is always at Church  
Would not have bandy children nor fasting nor birch

Then God like a father \[*that joys for*\] rejoicing to see  
His children as pleasant & happy as he  
Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the Barrel  
\[*But shake hands & kiss him & thered be no more hell*\]  
But kiss him & give him both \[*food*\] drink & apparel

AN ANSWER TO THE PARSON

Why of the sheep do you not learn peace  
Because I dont want you to shear my fleece

\*



HOLY THURSDAY

Is this a holy thing to see  
In a rich & fruitful land  
Babes reducd to misery  
Fed with cold & usurous hand

Is that trembling cry a song  
Can it be a song of joy  
And so great a number poor  
Tis a land of poverty

And their sun does never shine

10   And their fields are bleak & bare

And their ways are filld with thorns  
Tis eternal winter there

But whereeer the sun does shine  
And whereeer the rain does fall  
Babe can never hunger there  
Nor poverty the mind appall

\[*THE ANGEL*\]

I dreamt a dream what can it mean  
And that I was a maiden queen  
Guarded by an angel mild  
Witless woe was neer beguild

And I wept both night and day  
And he wiped my tears away  
And I wept both day & night  
And hid from him my hearts delight

So he took his wings & fled

10    Then the morn blushd rosy red

I dried my tears & armd my fears  
With ten thousand shields & spears

Soon my angel came again  
I was armd he came in vain  
\[*But*\] For the time of youth was fled  
And grey hairs were on my head

The look of love alarms  
Because tis filld with fire  
But the look of soft deceit

Soft deceit & idleness  
These are beauties sweetest dress

\[*Woe alas my guilty hand  
Brushed across thy summer joy  
All thy gilded painted pride  
Shatterd fled*\]

Thy summer play  
My \[*guilty hand*\] thoughtless hand  
Hath brushd away

10   \[*The cut worm*

*Forgives the plow  
And dies in peace  
And so do thou*\]

2   Am not I

A fly like thee

Or art not thou  
A man like me

3   For I dance

And drink & sing  
Till some blind hand

20   Shall brush my wing

5   Then am I

A happy fly  
If I live  
Or if I die

\[*4   Thought is life*

30   And strength & breath

*But the want* \(*of*\)  
*Of Thought is death*\]

4   If thought is life

30 And strength & breath

And the want \[*of*\]  
Of Thought is death

MOTTO TO THE SONGS OF INNOCENCE & OF EXPERIENCE

The Good are attracted by Mens perceptions

   And Think not for themselves

   Till Experience teaches them to catch

   And to cage the Fairies & Elves

And then the Knave begins to snarl  
And the Hypocrite to howl  
And all his good Friends shew their private ends  
And the Eagle is known from the Owl

\*

Her whole Life is an Epigram smack smooth & neatly pend

Platted quite neat to catch applause with a sliding noose at the end

An old maid early eer I knew  
Ought but the love that on me grew  
And now Im coverd oer & oer  
And wish that I had been a Whore

O I cannot cannot find  
The undaunted courage of a Virgin Mind  
For Early I in love was crost  
Before my flower of love was lost

AN ANCIENT PROVERB

Remove away that blackning church  
Remove away that marriage hearse  
Remove away that – of blood  
Youll quite remove the ancient curse

1    1  Let the Brothels of Paris be opened  
      2 With many an alluring dance  
      3 To awake the \[*Pestilence*\] Physicians thro the city  
      4 Said the beautiful Queen of France

4    9  The King awoke on his couch of gold  
     10 As soon as he heard these tidings told  
     11 Arise & come both fife & drum  
     12 And the \[*Famine*\] shall eat both crust & crumb

For the links of a dungeon floor

3      O who would smile on the wintry seas

\[*Or*\] & Pity the stormy roar

THE FRENCH REVOLUTION

BOOK THE FIRST

The dead brood over Europe, the cloud and vision descends over chearful France;

O cloud well appointed\! Sick, sick: the Prince on his couch, wreath’d in dim

And appalling mist; his strong hand outstretch’d, from his shoulder down the bone

Runs aching cold into the scepter too heavy for mortal grasp. No more

To be swayed by visible hand, nor in cruelty bruise the mild flourishing mountains.

     Sick the mountains, and all their vineyards weep, in the eyes of the kingly mourner;

Pale is the morning cloud in his visage. Rise, Necker: the ancient dawn calls us

To awake from slumbers of five thousand years. I awake, but my soul is in dreams;

From my window I see the old mountains of France, like aged men, fading away.

PAGE 2

10   Troubled, leaning on Necker, descends the King, to his chamber of council; shady mountains

In fear, utter voices of thunder; the woods of France embosom the sound;

Clouds of wisdom prophetic reply, and roll over the palace roof heavy.

Forty men: each conversing with woes in the infinite shadows of his soul,

Like our ancient fathers in regions of twilight, walk, gathering round the King;

Again the loud voice of France cries to the morning, the morning prophecies to its clouds.

For the Commons convene in the Hall of the Nation. France shakes\! And the heavens of France

Perplex’d vibrate round each careful countenance\! Darkness of old times around them

Utters loud despair, shadowing Paris; her grey towers groan, and the Bastile trembles.

In its terrible towers the Governor stood, in dark fogs list’ning the horror;

20   A thousand his soldiers, old veterans of France, breathing red clouds of power and dominion,

Sudden seiz’d with howlings, despair, and black night, he stalk’d like a lion from tower

To tower, his howlings were heard in the Louvre; from court to court restless he dragg’d

His strong limbs; from court to court curs’d the fierce torment unquell’d,

Howling and giving the dark command; in his soul stood the purple plague,

Tugging his iron manacles, and piercing through the seven towers dark and sickly,

Panting over the prisoners like a wolf gorg’d; and the den nam’d Horror held a man

Chain’d hand and foot, round his neck an iron band, bound to the impregnable wall.

In his soul was the serpent coil’d round in his heart, hid from the light, as in a cleft rock;

And the man was confin’d for a writing prophetic: in the tower nam’d Darkness, was a man

30   Pinion’d down to the stone floor, his strong bones scarce cover’d with sinews; the iron rings

Were forg’d smaller as the flesh decay’d, a mask of iron on his face hid the lineaments

PAGE 3

Of ancient Kings, and the frown of the eternal lion was hid from the oppressed earth.

In the tower named Bloody, a skeleton yellow remained in its chains on its couch

Of stone, once a man who refus’d to sign papers of abhorrence; the eternal worm

Crept in the skeleton. In the den nam’d Religion, a loathsome sick woman, bound down

To a bed of straw; the seven diseases of earth, like birds of prey, stood on the couch,

And fed on the body. She refus’d to be whore to the Minister, and with a knife smote him.

In the tower nam’d Order, an old man, whose white beard cover’d the stone floor like weeds

On margin of the sea, shrivel’d up by heat of day and cold of night; his den was short

40   And narrow as a grave dug for a child, with spiders webs wove, and with slime

Of ancient horrors cover’d, for snakes and scorpions are his companions; harmless they breathe

His sorrowful breath: he, by conscience urg’d, in the city of Paris rais’d a pulpit,

And taught wonders to darken’d souls. In the den nam’d Destiny a strong man sat,

His feet and hands cut off, and his eyes blinded; round his middle a chain and a band

Fasten’d into the wall; fancy gave him to see an image of despair in his den,

Eternally rushing round, like a man on his hands and knees, day and night without rest:

He was friend to the favourite. In the seventh tower, nam’d the tower of God, was a man

Mad, with chains loose, which he dragg’d up and down; fed with hopes year by year, he pined

For liberty; vain hopes: his reason decay’d, and the world of attraction in his bosom

50   Center’d, and the rushing of chaos overwhelm’d his dark soul. He was confin’d

For a letter of advice to a King, and his ravings in winds are heard over Versailles.

But the dens shook and trembled, the prisoners look up and assay to shout; they listen,

Then laugh in the dismal den, then are silent, and a light walks round the dark towers.

PAGE 4

For the Commons convene in the Hall of the Nation; like spirits of fire in the beautiful

Porches of the Sun, to plant beauty in the desart craving abyss, they gleam

On the anxious city; all children new-born first behold them; tears are fled,

And they nestle in earth-breathing bosoms. So the city of Paris, their wives and children,

Look up to the morning Senate, and visions of sorrow leave pensive streets.

But heavy brow’d jealousies lower o’er the Louvre, and terrors of ancient Kings

60   Descend from the gloom and wander thro’ the palace and weep round the King and his Nobles.

While loud thunders roll, troubling the dead, Kings are sick throughout all the earth,

The voice ceas’d: the Nation sat: And the triple forg’d fetters of times were unloos’d.

The voice ceas’d: the Nation sat: but ancient darkness and trembling wander thro’ the palace.

As in day of havock and routed battle, among thick shades of discontent,

On the soul-skirting mountains of sorrow cold waving: the Nobles fold round the King,

Each stern visage lock’d up as with strong bands of iron, each strong limb bound down as with marble,

In flames of red wrath burning, bound in astonishment a quarter of an hour.

Then the King glow’d: his Nobles fold round, like the sun of old time quench’d in clouds;

In their darkness the King stood, his heart flam’d, and utter’d a with’ring heat, and these words burst forth:

70   ‘The nerves of five thousand years ancestry tremble, shaking the heavens of France;

‘Throbs of anguish beat on brazen war foreheads, they descend and look into their graves.

PAGE 5

‘I see thro’ darkness, thro’ clouds rolling round me, the spirits of ancient Kings

‘Shivering over their bleached bones; round them their counsellors look up from the dust,

‘Crying: “Hide from the living\! Our b\[a\]nds and our prisoners shout in the open field,

‘“Hide in the nether earth\! Hide in the bones\! Sit obscured in the hollow scull.

‘“Our flesh is corrupted, and we \[wear\] away. We are not numbered among the living. Let us hide

‘“In stones, among roots of trees. The prisoners have burst their dens,

‘“Let us hide; let us hide in the dust; and plague and wrath and tempest shall cease.”’

He ceas’d, silent pond’ring, his brows folded heavy, his forehead was in affliction,

80   Like the central fire: from the window he saw his vast armies spread over the hills,

Breathing red fires from man to man, and from horse to horse; then his bosom

Expanded like starry heaven, he sat down: his Nobles took their ancient seats.

Then the ancientest Peer, Duke of Burgundy, rose from the Monarch’s right hand, red as wines

From his mountains, an odor of war, like a ripe vineyard, rose from his garments,

And the chamber became as a clouded sky; o’er the council he stretch’d his red limbs,

Cloth’d in flames of crimson, as a ripe vineyard stretches over sheaves of corn,

The fierce Duke hung over the council; around him croud, weeping in his burning robe,

A bright cloud of infant souls; his words fall like purple autumn on the sheaves.

‘Shall this marble built heaven become a clay cottage, this earth an oak stool, and these mowers

90   ‘From the Atlantic mountains, mow down all this great starry harvest of six thousand years?

‘And shall Necker, the hind of Geneva, stretch out his crook’d sickle o’er fertile France,

PAGE 6

‘Till our purple and crimson is faded to russet, and the kingdoms of earth bound in sheaves,

‘And the ancient forests of chivalry hewn, and the joys of the combat burnt for fuel;

‘Till the power and dominion is rent from the pole, sword and scepter from sun and moon,

‘The law and gospel from fire and air, and eternal reason and science

‘From the deep and the solid, and man lay his faded head down on the rock

‘Of eternity, where the eternal lion and eagle remain to devour?

‘This to prevent, urg’d by cries in day, and prophetic dreams hovering in night,

‘To enrich the lean earth that craves, furrow’d with plows; whose seed is departing from her;

100  ‘Thy Nobles have gather’d thy starry hosts round this rebellious city

‘To rouze up the ancient forests of Europe, with clarions of \[loud\] breathing war;

‘To hear the horse neigh to the drum and trumpet, and the trumpet and war shout reply;

‘Stretch the hand that beckons the eagles of heaven; they cry over Paris, and wait

‘Till Fayette point his finger to Versailles; the eagles of heaven must have their prey.’

The King lean’d on his mountains, then lifted his head and look’d on his armies, that shone

Through heaven, tinging morning with beams of blood, then turning to Burgundy troubled:

PAGE 7

‘Burgundy, thou wast born a lion\! My soul is o’ergrown with distress

‘For the Nobles of France, and dark mists roll round me and blot the writing of God

‘Written in my bosom. Necker rise, leave the kingdom, thy life is surrounded with snares;

110   ‘We have call’d an Assembly, but not to destroy; we have given gifts, not to the weak;

‘I hear rushing of muskets, and bright’ning of swords, and visages redd’ning with war,

‘Frowning and looking up from brooding villages and every dark’ning city;

‘Ancient wonders frown over the kingdom, and cries of women and babes are heard,

‘And tempests of doubt roll around me, and fierce sorrows, because of the Nobles of France;

‘Depart, answer not, for the tempest must fall, as in years that are passed away.’

He ceas’d, and burn’d silent, red clouds roll round Necker, a weeping is heard o’er the palace;

Like a dark cloud Necker paus’d, and like thunder on the just man’s burial day he paus’d;

Silent sit the winds, silent the meadows, while the husbandman and woman of weakness

And bright children look after him into the grave, and water his clay with love,

120   Then turn towards pensive fields; so Necker paus’d, and his visage was cover’d with clouds.

Dropping a tear the old man his place left, and when he was gone out

He set his face toward Geneva to flee, and the women and children of the city

Kneel’d round him and kissed his garments and wept; he stood a short space in the street,

Then fled; and the whole city knew he was fled to Geneva, and the Senate heard it.

But the Nobles burn’d wrathful at Necker’s departure, and wreath’d their clouds and waters

In dismal volumes; as risen from beneath the Archbishop of Paris arose,

In the rushing of scales and hissing of flames and rolling of sulphurous smoke.

‘Hearken, Monarch of France, to the terrors of heaven, and let thy soul drink of my counsel;

‘Sleeping at midnight in my golden tower, the repose of the labours of men

130   ‘Wav’d its solemn cloud over my head. I awoke; a cold hand passed over my limbs, and behold

‘An aged form, white as snow, hov’ring in mist, weeping in the uncertain light,

PAGE 8

‘Dim the form almost faded, tears fell down the shady cheeks; at his feet many cloth’d

‘In white robes, strewn in air censers and harps, silent they lay prostrated;

‘Beneath, in the awful void, myriads descending and weeping thro’ dismal winds,

‘Endless the shady train shiv’ring descended, from the gloom where the aged form wept.

‘At length, trembling, the vision sighing, in a low voice, like the voice of the grasshopper whisper’d:

‘“My groaning is heard in the abbeys, and God, so long worshipp’d, departs as a lamp

‘“Without oil; for a curse is heard hoarse thro’ the land, from a godless race

‘“Descending to beasts; they look downward and labour and forget my holy law;

140   ‘“The sound of prayer fails from lips of flesh, and the holy hymn from thicken’d tongues:

‘“For the bars of Chaos are burst; her millions prepare their fiery way

‘“Thro’ the orbed abode of the holy dead, to root up and pull down and remove,

‘“And Nobles and Clergy shall fail from before me, and my cloud and vision be no more;

‘“The mitre become black, the crown vanish, and the scepter and ivory staff

‘“Of the ruler wither among bones of death; they shall consume from the thistly field,

‘“And the sound of the bell, and voice of the sabbath, and singing of the holy choir,

‘“Is turn’d into songs of the harlot in day, and cries of the virgin in night.

‘“They shall drop at the plow and faint at the harrow, unredeem’d, unconfess’d, unpardon’d;

‘“The priest rot in his surplice by the lawless lover, the holy beside the accursed,

150   ‘“The King, frowning in purple, beside the grey plowman, and their worms embrace together.”

‘The voice ceas’d, a groan shook my chamber; I slept, for the cloud of repose returned,

‘But morning dawn’d heavy upon me. I rose to bring my Prince heaven utter’d counsel.

‘Hear my counsel, O King, and send forth thy Generals, the command of Heaven is upon thee;

‘Then do thou command, O King, to shut up this Assembly in their final home;

PAGE 9

‘Let thy soldiers possess this city of rebels, that threaten to bathe their feet

‘In the blood of Nobility; trampling the heart and the head; let the Bastile devour

‘These rebellious seditious; seal them up, O Anointed, in everlasting chains.’

He sat down, a damp cold pervaded the Nobles, and monsters of worlds unknown

Swam round them, watching to be delivered; When Aumont, whose chaos-born soul

160   Eternally wand’ring a Comet and swift-falling fire, pale enter’d the chamber;

Before the red Council he stood, like a man that returns from hollow graves.

‘Awe surrounded, alone thro’ the army a fear and a with’ring blight blown by the north;

‘The Abbe de S\[i\]eyes from the Nation’s Assembly. O Princes and Generals of France,

‘Unquestioned, unhindered, awe-struck are the soldiers; a dark shadowy man in the form

‘Of King Henry the Fourth walks before him in fires, the captains like men bound in chains

‘Stood still as he pass’d, he is come to the Louvre, O King, with a message to thee;

‘The strong soldiers tremble, the horses their manes bow, and the guards of thy palace are fled.’

Up rose awful in his majestic beams Bourbon’s strong Duke; his proud sword from his thigh

Drawn, he threw on the Earth\! the Duke of Bretagne and the Earl of Borgogne

170   Rose inflam’d, to and fro in the chamber, like thunder-clouds ready to burst.

‘What, damp all our fires, O spectre of Henry,’ said Bourbon; ‘and rend the flames

‘From the head of our King\! Rise, Monarch of France; command me, and I will lead

‘This army of superstition at large, that the ardor of noble souls quenchless,

‘May yet burn in France, nor our shoulders be plow’d with the furrows of poverty.’

PAGE 10

Then Orleans generous as mountains arose, and unfolded his robe, and put forth

His benevolent hand, looking on the Archbishop, who changed as pale as lead;

Would have risen but could not, his voice issued harsh grating; instead of words harsh hissings

Shook the chamber; he ceas’d abash’d. Then Orleans spoke, all was silent,

He breath’d on them, and said, ‘O princes of fire, whose flames are for growth not consuming,

180   ‘Fear not dreams, fear not visions, nor be you dismay’d with sorrows which flee at the morning;

‘Can the fires of Nobility ever be quench’d, or the stars by a stormy night?

‘Is the body diseas’d when the members are healthful? can the man be bound in sorrow

‘Whose ev’ry function is fill’d with its fiery desire? can the soul whose brain and heart

‘Cast their rivers in equal tides thro’ the great Paradise, languish because the feet

‘Hands, head, bosom, and parts of love, follow their high breathing joy?

‘And can Nobles be bound when the people are free, or God weep when his children are happy?

‘Have you never seen Fayette’s forehead, or Mirabeau’s eyes, or the shoulders of Target,

‘Or Bailly the strong foot of France, or Clermont the terrible voice, and your robes

‘Still retain their own crimson? mine never yet faded, for fire delights in its form.

190   ‘But go, merciless man\! enter into the infinite labyrinth of another’s brain

‘Ere thou measure the circle that he shall run. Go, thou cold recluse, into the fires

‘Of another’s high flaming rich bosom, and return unconsum’d, and write laws.

‘If thou can’st not do this, doubt thy theories, learn to consider all men as thy equals,

‘Thy brethern, and not as thy foot or thy hand, unless thou first fearest to hurt them.’

The Monarch stood up, the strong Duke his sword to its golden scabbard return’d,

The Nobles sat round like clouds on the mountains, when the storm is passing away.

PAGE II

‘Let the Nation’s Ambassador come among Nobles, like incense of the valley.’

Aumont went out and stood in the hollow porch, his ivory wand in his hand;

A cold orb of disdain revolv’d round him, and covered his soul with snows eternal.

200   Great Henry’s soul shuddered, a whirlwind and fire tore furious from his angry bosom;

He indignant departed on horses of heav’n. Then the Abbe de S\[i\]eyes rais’d his feet

On the steps of the Louvre, like a voice of God following a storm, the Abbe follow’d

The pale fires of Aumont into the chamber, as a father that bows to his son;

Whose rich fields inheriting spread their old glory, so the voice of the people bowed

Before the ancient seat of the kingdom and mountains to be renewed.

‘Hear, O Heavens of France, the voice of the people, arising from valley and hill,

‘O’erclouded with power. Hear the voice of vallies, the voice of meek cities,

‘Mourning oppressed on village and field, till the village and field is a waste.

‘For the husbandman weeps at blights of the fife, and blasting of trumpets consume

210   ‘The souls of mild France; the pale mother nourishes her child to the deadly slaughter.

‘When the heavens were seal’d with a stone, and the terrible sun clos’d in an orb, and the moon

‘Rent from the nations, and each star appointed for watchers of night,

‘The millions of spirits immortal were bound in the ruins of sulphur heaven

‘To wander inslav’d; black, deprest in dark ignorance, kept in awe with the whip,

‘To worship terrors, bred from the blood of revenge and breath of desire,

‘In beastial forms; or more terrible men, till the dawn of our peaceful morning,

‘Till dawn, till morning, till the breaking of clouds, and swelling of winds, and the universal voice,

PAGE 12

‘Till man raise his darken’d limbs out of the caves of night, his eyes and his heart

‘Expand: where is space\! where O Sun is thy dwelling\! where thy tent, O faint slumb’rous Moon.

220   ‘Then the valleys of France shall cry to the soldier, “throw down thy sword and musket,

‘“And run and embrace the meek peasant.” Her Nobles shall hear and shall weep, and put off

‘The red robe of terror, the crown of oppression, the shoes of contempt, and unbuckle

‘The girdle of war from the desolate earth; then the Priest in his thund’rous cloud

‘Shall weep, bending to earth embracing the valleys, and putting his hand to the plow,

‘Shall say, “No more I curse thee; but now I will bless thee: No more in deadly black

‘“Devour thy labour; nor lift up a cloud in thy heavens, O laborious plow,

‘“That the wild raging millions, that wander in forests, and howl in law blasted wastes,

‘“Strength madden’d with slavery, honesty, bound in the dens of superstition,

‘“May sing in the village, and shout in the harvest, and woo in pleasant gardens,

230   ‘“Their once savage loves, now beaming with knowledge, with gentle awe adorned;

‘“And the saw, and the hammer, the chisel, the pencil, the pen, and the instruments

‘“Of heavenly song sound in the wilds once forbidden, to teach the laborious plowman

‘“And shepherd deliver’d from clouds of war, from pestilence, from night-fear, from murder,

‘“From falling, from stifling, from hunger, from cold, from slander, discontent and sloth;

‘“That walk in beasts and birds of night, driven back by the sandy desart

‘“Like pestilent fogs round cities of men: and the happy earth sing in its course,

‘“The mild peaceable nations be opened to heav’n, and men walk with their fathers in bliss.”

‘Then hear the first voice of the morning: “Depart, O clouds of night, and no more

‘“Return; be withdrawn cloudy war, troops of warriors depart, nor around our peaceable city

240   ‘“Breathe fires, but ten miles from Paris, let all be peace, nor a soldier be seen\!”

PAGE 13

He ended; the wind of contention arose and the clouds cast their shadows, the Princes

Like the mountains of France, whose aged trees utter an awful voice, and their branches

Are shatter’d, till gradual a murmur is heard descending into the valley,

Like a voice in the vineyards of Burgundy, when grapes are shaken on grass;

Like the low voice of the labouring man, instead of the shout of joy;

And the palace appear’d like a cloud driven abroad; blood ran down the ancient pillars,

Thro’ the cloud a deep thunder, the Duke of Burgundy, delivers the King’s command.

‘Seest thou yonder dark castle, that moated around, keeps this city of Paris in awe.

‘Go command yonder tower, saying, “Bastile depart, and take thy shadowy course.

250   ‘“Overstep the dark river, thou terrible tower, and get thee up into the country ten miles.

‘“And thou black southern prison, move along the dusky road to Versailles; there

‘“Frown on the gardens”, and if it obey and depart, then the King will disband

‘This war-breathing army; but if it refuse, let the Nation’s Assembly thence learn,

‘That this army of terrors, that prison of horrors, are the bands of the murmuring kingdom.’

Like the morning star arising above the black waves, when a shipwreck’d soul sighs for morning,

Thro’ the ranks, silent, walk’d the Ambassador back to the Nation’s Assembly, and told

The unwelcome message; silent they heard; then a thunder roll’d round loud and louder,

Like pillars of ancient halls, and ruins of times remote they sat.

Like a voice from the dim pillars Mirabeau rose; the thunders subsided away;

PAGE 14

260   A rushing of wings around him was heard as he brighten’d, and cried out aloud,

‘Where is the General of the Nation?’ the walls reecho’d: ‘Where is the General of the Nation?’

Sudden as the bullet wrapp’d in his fire, when brazen cannons rage in the field,

Fayette sprung from his seat saying, Ready\! then bowing like clouds, man toward man, the Assembly

Like a council of ardors seated in clouds, bending over the cities of men,

And over the armies of strife, where their children are marshall’d together to battle;

They murmuring divide, while the wind sleeps beneath, and the numbers are counted in silence,

While they vote the removal of War, and the pestilence weighs his red wings in the sky.

So Fayette stood silent among the Assembly, and the votes were given and the numbers numb’red;

And the vote was, that Fayette should order the army to remove ten miles from Paris.

270   The aged sun rises appall’d from dark mountains, and gleams a dusky beam

On Fayette, but on the whole army a shadow, for a cloud on the eastern hills

Hover’d, and stretch’d across the city and across the army, and across the Louvre,

Like a flame of fire he stood before dark ranks, and before expecting captains

On pestilent vapours around him flow frequent spectres of religious men weeping

In winds driven out of the abbeys, their naked souls shiver in keen open air,

Driven out by the fiery cloud of Voltaire, and thund’rous rocks of Rousseau,

They dash like foam against the ridges of the army, uttering a faint feeble cry.

PAGE 15

Gleams of fire streak the heavens, and of sulphur the earth, from Fayette as he lifted his hand;

But silent he stood, till all the officers rush round him like waves

280   Round the shore of France, in day of the British flag, when heavy cannons

Affright the coasts, and the peasant looks over the sea and wipes a tear;

Over his head the soul of Voltaire shone fiery, and over the army Rousseau his white cloud

Unfolded, on souls of war-living terrors silent list’ning toward Fayette,

His voice loud inspir’d by liberty, and by spirits of the dead, thus thunder’d.

‘The Nation’s Assembly command, that the Army remove ten miles from Paris;

‘Nor a soldier be seen in road or in field, till the Nation command return.’

Rushing along iron ranks glittering the officers each to his station

Depart, and the stern captain strokes his proud steed, and in front of his solid ranks

Waits the sound of trumpet; captains of foot stand each by his cloudy drum;

290   Then the drum beats, and the steely ranks move, and trumpets rejoice in the sky.

Dark cavalry like clouds fraught with thunder ascend on the hills, and bright infantry, rank

Behind rank, to the soul shaking drum and shrill fife along the roads glitter like fire.

The noise of trampling, the wind of trumpets, smote the palace walls with a blast.

Pale and cold sat the King in midst of his peers, and his noble heart sunk, and his pulses

Suspended their motion, a darkness crept over his eye-lids, and chill cold sweat

Sat round his brows faded in faint death, his peers pale like mountains of the dead,

Cover’d with dews of night, groaning, shaking forests and floods. The cold newt

PAGE 16

And snake, and damp toad, on the kingly foot crawl, or croak on the awful knee,

Shedding their slime, in folds of the robe the crown’d adder builds and hisses

300   From stony brows; shaken the forests of France, sick the kings of the nations,

And the bottoms of the world were open’d, and the graves of arch-angels unseal’d;

The enormous dead, lift up their pale fires and look over the rocky cliffs.

A faint heat from their fires reviv’d the cold Louvre; the frozen blood reflow’d.

Awful up rose the king, him the peers follow’d, they saw the courts of the Palace

Forsaken, and Paris without a soldier, silent, for the noise was gone up

And follow’d the army, and the Senate in peace, sat beneath morning’s beam.

## **********THE MARRIAGE OF HEAVEN AND HELL**





PLATE 2

THE ARGUMENT

Rintrah roars & shakes his fires in the burdend air;  
Hungry clouds swag on the deep

Once meek, and in a perilous path,  
The just man kept his course along  
The vale of death.  
Roses are planted where thorns grow.  
And on the barren heath  
Sing the honey bees.

Then the perilous path was planted:

10     And a river, and a spring

On every cliff and tomb;  
And on the bleached bones  
Red clay brought forth.

Till the villain left the paths of ease,  
To walk in perilous paths, and drive  
The just man into barren climes.

Now the sneaking serpent walks  
In mild humility.  
And the just man rages in the wilds

20     Where lions roam.

Rintrah roars & shakes his fires in the burdend air;  
Hungry clouds swag on the deep.

PLATE 3

As a new heaven is begun, and it is now thirty-three years since its advent: the Eternal Hell revives. And lo\! Swedenborg is the Angel sitting at the tomb; his writings are the linen clothes folded up. Now is the dominion of Edom, & the return of Adam into Paradise; see Isaiah XXXIV & XXXV Chap:

Without Contraries is no progression. Attraction and Repulsion, Reason and Energy, Love and Hate, are necessary to Human existence.

10     From these contraries spring what the religious call Good & Evil. Good is the passive that obeys Reason\[.\] Evil is the active springing from Energy.

Good is Heaven. Evil is Hell.



PLATE 4

THE VOICE OF THE DEVIL

All Bibles or sacred codes. have been the causes of the following Errors.

1. That Man has two real existing principles Viz: a Body & a Soul.

2. That Energy. calld Evil. is alone from the Body. & that Reason. calld Good. is alone from the Soul.

3. That God will torment Man in Eternity for following his Energies.

But the following Contraries to these are True

10       1 Man has no Body distinct from his Soul for that calld Body is a portion of Soul discernd by the five Senses, the chief inlets of Soul in this age

2 Energy is the only life and is from the Body and Reason is the bound or outward circumference of Energy.

3 Energy is Eternal Delight

PLATE 5

Those who restrain desire, do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained; and the restrainer or reason usurps its place & governs the unwilling.

And being restraind it by degrees becomes passive till it is only the shadow of desire.

The history of this is written in Paradise Lost. & the Governor or Reason is call’d Messiah.

And the original Archangel or possessor of the command of the heavenly host, is calld the Devil or Satan

10       and his children are call’d Sin & Death

But in the Book of Job Miltons Messiah is call’d Satan.

For this history has been adopted by both parties

It indeed appear’d to Reason as if Desire was cast out, but the Devils account is, that the Messi\[PL.6\]ah fell. & formed a heaven of what he stole from the Abyss

This is shewn in the Gospel, where he prays to the Father to send the comforter or Desire that Reason may have Ideas to build on, the Jehovah of the Bible being no other than he, who dwells in flaming fire. Know that after Christs death, he became Jehovah.

But in Milton; the Father is Destiny, the Son, a Ratio of the five senses. & the Holy-ghost, Vacuum\!

10       Note. The reason Milton wrote in fetters when he wrote of Angels & God, and at liberty when of Devils & Hell, is because he was a true Poet and of the Devils party without knowing it



A MEMORABLE FANCY

As I was walking among the fires of hell, delighted with the enjoyments of Genius; which to Angels look like torment and insanity. I collected some of their Proverbs: thinking that as the sayings used in a nation, mark its character, so the Proverbs of Hell, shew the nature of Infernal wisdom better than any description of buildings or garments.

When I came home; on the abyss of the five senses, where a flat sided steep frowns over the present world. I saw a mighty Devil folded in black clouds, hovering on the sides of the rock, with cor\[PL.7\]roding fires he wrote the following sentence now percieved by the minds of men, & read by them on earth.

    How do you know but ev’ry Bird that cuts the airy way, Is an immense world of delight, clos’d by your senses five?



PROVERBS OF HELL

In seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy.  
Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead.  
The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.  
Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity.

10     He who desires but acts not, breeds pestilence.

The cut worm forgives the plow.  
Dip him in the river who loves water.  
A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.  
He whose face gives no light, shall never become a star.  
Eternity is in love with the productions of time.  
The busy bee has no time for sorrow.  
The hours of folly are measur’d by the clock, but of wisdom: no clock can measure.  
All wholsom food is caught without a net or a trap.  
Bring out number weight & measure in a year of dearth.

20     No bird soars too high. if he soars with his own wings.

A dead body. revenges not injuries.  
The most sublime act is to set another before you.  
If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise  
Folly is the cloke of knavery.  
Shame is Prides cloke.

PLATE 8

Prisons are built with stones of Law, Brothels with bricks of Religion.

The pride of the peacock is the glory of God.  
The lust of the goat is the bounty of God.  
The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.  
The nakedness of woman is the work of God.  
Excess of sorrow laughs. Excess of joy weeps.  
The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword. are portions of eternity too great for the eye of man.  
The fox condemns the trap, not himself.  
Joys impregnate. Sorrows bring forth.

10     Let man wear the fell of the lion. woman the fleece of the sheep.

The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship.  
The selfish smiling fool. & the sullen frowning fool. shall be both thought wise. that they may be a rod.  
What is now proved was once, only imagin’d.  
The rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbet; watch the roots, the lion, the tyger, the horse, the elephant, watch the fruits.  
The cistern contains: the fountain overflows  
One thought. fills immensity.  
Always be ready to speak your mind, and a base man will avoid you.  
Every thing possible to be believ’d is an image of truth.  
The eagle never lost so much time. as when he submitted to learn of the crow.

PLATE 9

The fox provides for himself. but God provides for the lion.

Think in the morning, Act in the noon, Eat in the evening, Sleep in the night.

He who has sufferd you to impose on him knows you.

As the plow follows words, so God rewards prayers.

The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction

Expect poison from the standing water.

You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough.

Listen to the fools reproach\! it is a kingly title\!  
The eyes of fire, the nostrils of air, the mouth of water, the beard of earth.

10     The weak in courage is strong in cunning.

The apple tree never asks the beech how he shall grow, nor the lion, the horse, how he shall take his prey.  
The thankful reciever bears a plentiful harvest.  
If others had not been foolish, we should be so.  
The soul of sweet delight, can never be defil’d,  
When thou seest an Eagle, thou seest a portion of Genius. lift up thy head\!  
As the catterpiller chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on, so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys.  
To create a little flower is the labour of ages.  
Damn. braces: Bless relaxes.  
The best wine is the oldest. the best water the newest.

20     Prayers plow not\! Praises reap not\!

Joys laugh not\! Sorrows weep not\!

PLATE 10

The head Sublime, the heart Pathos, the genitals Beauty, the hands & feet Proportion.

As the air to a bird or the sea to a fish, so is contempt to the contemptible.

The crow wish’d every thing was black, the owl, that every thing was white.

Exuberance is Beauty.

If the lion was advis’d by the fox. he would be cunning.

Improve\[me\]nt makes strait roads, but the crooked roads without Improvement, are roads of Genius.

Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires

Where man is not nature is barren.

Truth can never be told so as to be understood, and not be believ’d.

10                            Enough\! or Too much

PLATE II

The ancient Poets animated all sensible objects with Gods or Geniuses, calling them by the names and adorning them with the properties of woods, rivers, mountains, lakes, cities, nations, and whatever their enlarged & numerous senses could percieve.

And particularly they studied the genius of each city & country. placing it under its mental deity.

10       Till a system was formed, which some took advantage of & enslav’d the vulgar by attempting to realize or abstract the mental deities from their objects; thus began Priesthood.

Choosing forms of worship from poetic tales.

And at length they pronounced that the Gods had orderd such things.

Thus men forgot that All deities reside in the human breast.

PLATE 12

A MEMORABLE FANCY

The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel dined with me, and I asked them how they dared so roundly to assert. that God spake to them; and whether they did not think at the time, that they would be misunderstood, & so be the cause of imposition.

10       Isaiah answer’d. I saw no God. nor heard any, in a finite organical perception; but my senses discover’d the infinite in every thing, and as I was then perswaded, & remain confirm’d; that the voice of honest indignation is the voice of God, I cared not for consequences but wrote.

Then I asked: does a firm perswasion that a thing is so, make it so?

He replied. All poets believe that it does, & in ages of imagination this firm perswasion removed mountains; but many are not capable of a firm perswasion of any thing.

Then Ezekiel said. The philosophy of the east taught the first principles of human perception some nations held one principle for the origin & some another, we of Israel taught that the Poetic Genius \(as you now call it\)

20   was the first principle and all the others merely derivative, which was the cause of our despising the Priests & Philosophers of other countries, and prophecying that all Gods \[PL.13\] would at last be proved to originate in ours & to be the tributaries of the Poetic Genius, it was this. that our great poet King David desired so fervently & invokes so patheticly, saying by this he conquers enemies & governs kingdoms; and we so loved our God. that we cursed in his name all the deities of surrounding nations, and asserted that they had rebelled; from these opinions the vulgar came to think that all nations would at last be subject to the jews.

10       This said he, like all firm perswasions, is come to pass, for all nations believe the jews code and worship the jews god, and what greater subjection can be

I heard this with some wonder, & must confess my own conviction. After dinner I ask’d Isaiah to favour the world with his lost works, he said none of equal value was lost. Ezekiel said the same of his.

I also asked Isaiah what made him go naked and barefoot three years? he answered, the same that made our friend Diogenes the Grecian.

20       I then asked Ezekiel. why he eat dung, & lay so long on his right & left side? he answerd. the desire of raising other men into a perception of the infinite this the North American tribes practise. & is he honest who resists his genius or conscience. only for the sake of present ease or gratification?

![Image](images/000000.jpg)

PLATE 14

The ancient tradition that the world will be consumed in fire at the end of six thousand years is true. as I have heard from Hell.

For the cherub with his flaming sword is hereby commanded to leave his guard at tree of life, and when he does, the whole creation will be consumed, and appear infinite. and holy whereas it now appears finite & corrupt.

This will come to pass by an improvement of sensual enjoyment.

10       But first the notion that man has a body distinct from 10 his soul, is to be expunged; this I shall do, by printing in the infernal method. by corrosives, which in Hell are salutory and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid.

If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.

For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro’ narrow chinks of his cavern.

PLATE 15

A MEMORABLE FANCY

I was in a Printing house in Hell & saw the method in which knowledge is transmitted from generation to generation.

In the first chamber was a Dragon-Man, clearing away the rubbish from a caves mouth; within, a number of Dragons were hollowing the cave,

In the second chamber was a Viper folding round the rock & the cave, and others adorning it with gold silver and precious stones.

10       In the third chamber was an Eagle with wings and 10 feathers of air, he caused the inside of the cave to be infinite, around were numbers of Eagle like men, who built palaces in the immense cliffs.

In the fourth chamber were Lions of flaming fire raging around & melting the metals into living fluids.

In the fifth chamber were Unnam’d forms, which cast the metals into the expanse.

20       There they were reciev’d by Men who occupied the sixth chamber, and took the forms of books & were arranged in libraries.

![Image](images/000000.jpg)

PLATE 16

The Giants who formed this world into its sensual existence and now seem to live in it in chains, are in truth. the causes of its life & the sources of all activity, but the chains are, the cunning of weak and tame minds. which have power to resist energy, according to the proverb, the weak in courage is strong in cunning.

Thus one portion of being, is the Prolific. the other, the Devouring: to the devourer it seems as if the producer was in his chains, but it is not so, he only takes

10   portions of existence and fancies that the whole.

But the Prolific would cease to be Prolific unless the Devourer as a sea recieved the excess of his delights.

Some will say, Is not God alone the Prolific? I answer, God only Acts & Is, in existing beings or Men.

These two classes of men are always upon earth, & they should be enemies; whoever tries \[PL.17\] to reconcile them seeks to destroy existence.

Religion is an endeavour to reconcile the two.

Note. Jesus Christ did not wish to unite but to separate them, as in the Parable of sheep and goats\! & he says I came not to send Peace but a Sword.

Messiah or Satan or Tempter was formerly thought to be one of the Antediluvians who are our Energies.

A MEMORABLE FANCY

An Angel came to me and said O pitiable foolish young man\! O horrible\! O dreadful state\! consider the

10   hot burning dungeon thou art preparing for thyself to all eternity, to which thou art going in such career.

I said. perhaps you will be willing to shew me my eternal lot & we will contemplate together upon it and see whether your lot or mine is most desirable

So he took me thro’ a stable & thro’ a church & down into the church vault at the end of which was a mill: thro’ the mill we went, and came to a cave. down the winding cavern we groped our tedious way till a void

20   boundless as a nether sky appeard beneath us. & we held by the roots of trees and hung over this immensity, but I said, if you please we will commit ourselves to this void, and see whether providence is here also, if you will not I will? but he answerd, do not presume O young-man but as we here remain behold thy lot which will soon appear when the darkness passes away

So I remaind with him sitting in the twisted \[PL. 18\] root of an oak. he was suspended in a fungus which hung with the head downward into the deep;

By degrees we beheld the infinite Abyss, fiery as the smoke of a burning city; beneath us at an immense distance was the sun, black but shining\[;\] round it were fiery tracks on which revolv’d vast spiders, crawling after their prey; which flew or rather swum in the infinite deep, in the most terrific shapes of animals sprung from corruption. & the air was full of them, & seemd composed

10   of them; these are Devils. and are called Powers of the air, I now asked my companion which was my eternal lot? he said, between the black & white spiders

But now, from between the black & white spiders a cloud and fire burst and rolled thro the deep blackning all beneath, so that the nether deep grew black as a sea & rolled with a terrible noise: beneath us was nothing now to be seen but a black tempest, till looking east between the clouds & the waves. we saw a cataract of blood mixed with fire and not many stones throw from us appeard and sunk again the scaly fold of a monstrous serpent\[.\] at last

20   to the east, distant about three degrees appeard a fiery crest above the waves slowly it reared like a ridge of golden rocks till we discoverd two globes of crimson fire, from which the sea fled away in clouds of smoke, and now we saw, it was the head of Leviathan, his forehead was divided into streaks of green & purple like those on a tygers forehead: soon we saw his mouth & red gills hang just above the raging foam tinging the black deep with beams of blood, advancing toward \[PL. 19\] us with all the fury of a spiritual existence.

My friend the Angel climb’d up from his station into the mill; I remain’d alone, & then this appearance was no more, but I found myself sitting on a pleasant bank beside a river by moon light hearing a harper who sung to the harp, & his theme was, The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water, & breeds reptiles of the mind.

10       But I arose, and sought for the mill, & there I found my Angel, who surprised asked me, how I escaped?

I answerd. All that we saw was owing to your metaphysics: for when you ran away, I found myself on a bank by moonlight hearing a harper, But now we have seen my eternal lot, shall I shew you yours? he laughd at my proposal; but I by force suddenly caught him in my arms, & flew westerly thro’ the night, till we were elevated above the earths shadow: then I flung myself with him directly into the body of the sun, here I clothed

20   myself in white, & taking in my hand Swedenborgs volumes sunk from the glorious clime, and passed all the planets till we came to saturn, here I staid to rest & then leap’d into the void. between saturn & the fixed stars.

Here said I\! is your lot, in this space, if space it may be calld, Soon we saw the stable and the church, & I took him to the altar and open’d the Bible, and lo\! it was a deep pit, into which I descended driving the Angel before me, soon we saw seven houses of brick, one we enterd; in it were a \[PL. 20\] number of monkeys, baboons, & all of that species chaind by the middle, grinning and snatching at one another, but witheld by the shortness of their chains: however I saw that they sometimes grew numerous, and then the weak were caught by the strong and with a grinning aspect, first coupled with & then devourd, by plucking off first one limb and then another till the body was left a helpless trunk. this after grinning & kissing it with seeming fondness they devourd too; and

20   here & there I saw one savourily picking the flesh off his own tail; as the stench terribly annoyd us both we went into the mill, & I in my hand brought the skeleton of a body, which in the mill was Aristotles Analytics.

So the Angel said: thy phantasy has imposed upon me & thou oughtest to be ashamed.

I answerd: we impose on one another, & it is but lost time to converse with you whose works are only Analytics

Opposition is true Friendship.

![Image](images/000000.jpg)

PLATE 21

I have always found that Angels have the vanity to speak of themselves as the only wise; this they do with a confident insolence sprouting from systematic reasoning:

Thus Swedenborg boasts that what he writes is new: tho’ it is only the Contents or Index of already publish’d books

A man carried a monkey about for a shew. & because he was a little wiser than the monkey, grew vain. and conciev’d himself as much wiser than seven men. It is so

10   with Swedenborg; he shews the folly of churches & exposes hypocrites, till he imagines that all are religious. & himself the single \[PL. 22\] one on earth that ever broke a net.

Now hear a plain fact: Swedenborg has not written one new truth: Now hear another: he has written all the old falshoods.

And now hear the reason. He conversed with Angels who are all religious, & conversed not with Devils who all hate religion, for he was incapable thro’ his conceited notions.

10       Thus Swedenborgs writings are a recapitulation of all superficial opinions, and an analysis of the more sublime. but no further.

Have now another plain fact: Any man of mechanical talents may from the writings of Paracelsus or Jacob Behmen, produce ten thousand volumes of equal value with Swedenborg’s. and from those of Dante or Shakespear, an infinite number.

But when he has done this, let him not say that he knows better than his master, for he only holds a candle in sunshine. 20

A MEMORABLE FANCY

Once I saw a Devil in a flame of fire. who arose before an Angel that sat on a cloud. and the Devil utterd these words.

The worship of God is. Honouring his gifts in other men each according to his genius. and loving the \[PL. 23\] greatest men best, those who envy or calumniate great men hate God, for there is no other God.

The Angel hearing this became almost blue but mastering himself he grew yellow, & at last white pink & smiling. and then replied,

Thou Idolater, is not God One? & is not he visible in Jesus Christ? and has not Jesus Christ given his sanction to the law of ten commandments and are not all other men fools, sinners, & nothings?

10       The Devil answer’d; bray a fool in a morter with wheat, yet shall not his folly be beaten out of him: if Jesus Christ is the greatest man, you ought to love him in the greatest degree; now hear how he has given his sanction to the law of ten commandments: did he not mock at the sabbath, and so mock the sabbaths God? murder those who were murderd because of him? turn away the law from the woman taken in adultery? steal the labor of others to support him? bear false witness when he omitted making a defence before Pilate? covet

20   when he pray’d for his disciples, and when he bid them shake off the dust of their feet against such as refused to lodge them? I tell you, no virtue can exist without breaking these ten commandments ∴ Jesus was all virtue, and acted from im \[PL. 24\] pulse. not from rules.

When he had so spoken: I beheld the Angel who stretched out his arms embracing the flame of fire & he was consumed and arose as Elijah.

Note. This Angel, who is now become a Devil, is my particular friend: we often read the Bible together in its infernal or diabolical sense which the world shall have if they behave well

I have also: The Bible of Hell: which the world shall

20   have whether they will or no.

One Law for the Lion & Ox is Oppression

1. The Eternal Female groand\! it was heard over all the Earth:

2. Albions coast is sick silent; the American meadows faint\!

3. Shadows of Prophecy shiver along by the lakes and the rivers and mutter across the ocean? France rend down thy dungeon;

4. Golden Spain burst the barriers of old Rome;

5. Cast thy keys O Rome into the deep down falling,

10   even to eternity down falling,

6. And weep

7. In her trembling hands she took the new born terror howling:

8. On those infinite mountains of light now barr’d out by the atlantic sea, the new born fire stood before the starry king\!

9. Flag’d with grey brow’d snows and thunderous visages the jealous wings wav’d over the deep.

10. The speary hand burned aloft, unbuckled was the

20   shield, forth went the hand of jealousy among the flaming hair, and \[PL. 26\] hurl’d the new born wonder thro’ the starry night.

11. The fire, the fire, is falling\!

12. Look up\! look up\! O citizen of London. enlarge thy countenance; O Jew, leave counting gold\! return to thy oil and wine; O African\! black African\! \(go. winged thought widen his forehead.\)

13. The fiery limbs, the flaming hair, shot like the sinking sun into the western sea.

10      14. Wak’d from his eternal sleep, the hoary element roaring fled away:

15. Down rushd beating his wings in vain the jealous king; his grey brow’d councellors, thunderous warriors, curl’d veterans, among helms, and shields, and chariots\[,\] horses, elephants: banners, castles, slings and rocks,

16. Falling, rushing, ruining\! buried in the ruins, on Urthona’s dens.

17. All night beneath the ruins, then their sullen flames faded emerge round the gloomy king,

20      18. With thunder and fire: leading his starry hosts thro’ the waste wilderness \[PL. 27\] he promulgates his ten commands, glancing his beamy eyelids over the deep in dark dismay,

19. Where the son of fire in his eastern cloud, while the morning plumes her golden breast.

20. Spurning the clouds written with curses. stamps the stony law to dust, loosing the eternal horses from the dens of night, crying

Empire is no more\! and now the lion & wolf shall cease.

PLATE iii

THE ARGUMENT

I loved Theotormon  
And I was not ashamed  
I trembled in my virgin fears  
And I hid in Leutha’s vale\!

I plucked Leutha’s flower,  
And I rose up from the vale;  
But the terrible thunders tore  
My virgin mantle in twain.

PLATE I

VISIONS

Enslav’d, the Daughters of Albion weep: a trembling lamentation

Upon their mountains; in their valleys, sighs toward America.

For the soft soul of America, Oothoon wanderd in woe,

Along the vales of Leutha seeking flowers to comfort her;

And thus she spoke to the bright Marygold of Leutha’s vale

Art thou a flower\! art thou a nymph\! I see thee now a flower;

Now a nymph\! I dare not pluck thee from thy dewy bed\!

The Golden nymph replied; pluck thou my flower Oothoon the mild

Another flower shall spring, because the soul of sweet delight

10  Can never pass away. she ceas’d & closd her golden shrine.

Then Oothoon pluck’d the flower saying, I pluck thee from thy bed

Sweet flower. and put thee here to glow between my breasts

And thus I turn my face to where my whole soul seeks.

Over the waves she went in wing’d exulting swift delight;

And over Theotormons reign, took her impetuous course.

Bromion rent her with his thunders. on his stormy bed

Lay the faint maid, and soon her woes appalld his thunders hoarse

Bromion spoke. behold this harlot here on Bromions bed,

And let the jealous dolphins sport around the lovely maid;

20  Thy soft American plains are mine, and mine thy north & south:

Stampt with my signet are the swarthy children of the sun:

They are obedient, they resist not, they obey the scourge:

Their daughters worship terrors and obey the violent:

PLATE 2

Now thou maist marry Bromions harlot, and protect the child

Of Bromions rage, that Oothoon shall put forth in nine moons time

Then storms rent Theotormons limbs; he rolld his waves around.

And folded his black jealous waters round the adulterate pair

Bound back to back in Bromions caves terror & meekness dwell

At entrance Theotormon sits wearing the threshold hard

With secret tears; beneath him sound like waves on a desart shore

The voice of slaves beneath the sun, and children bought with money.

That shiver in religious caves beneath the burning fires

10  Of lust, that belch incessant from the summits of the earth

Oothoon weeps not: she cannot weep\! her tears are locked up;

But she can howl incessant writhing her soft snowy limbs.

And calling Theotormons Eagles to prey upon her flesh.

I call with holy voice\! kings of the sounding air,

Rend away this defiled bosom that I may reflect.

The image of Theotormon on my pure transparent breast.

The Eagles at her call descend & rend their bleeding prey;

Theotormon severely smiles. her soul reflects the smile;

As the clear spring mudded with feet of beasts grows pure & smiles.

20  The Daughters of Albion hear her woes. & eccho back her sighs.

Why does my Theotormon sit weeping upon the threshold;

And Oothoon hovers by his side, perswading him in vain:

I cry arise O Theotormon for the village dog

Barks at the breaking day. the nightingale has done lamenting.

The lark does rustle in the ripe corn, and the Eagle returns

From nightly prey, and lifts his golden beak to the pure east;

Shaking the dust from his immortal pinions to awake

The sun that sleeps too long. Arise my Theotormon I am pure.

Because the night is gone that clos’d me in its deadly black.

30  They told me that the night & day were all that I could see;

They told me that I had five senses to inclose me up.

And they inclos’d my infinite brain into a narrow circle.

And sunk my heart into the Abyss, a red round globe hot burning

Till all from life I was obliterated and erased.

Instead of morn arises a bright shadow, like an eye

In the eastern cloud: instead of night a sickly charnel house;

That Theotormon hears me not\! to him the night and morn

Are both alike: a night of sighs, a morning of fresh tears;

PLATE 3

And none but Bromion can hear my lamentations.

With what sense is it that the chicken shuns the ravenous hawk?

With what sense does the tame pigeon measure out the expanse?

With what sense does the bee form cells? have not the mouse & frog

Eyes and ears and sense of touch? yet are their habitations.

And their pursuits, as different as their forms and as their joys:

Ask the wild ass why he refuses burdens: and the meek camel

Why he loves man: is it because of eye ear mouth or skin

Or breathing nostrils? No. for these the wolf and tyger have.

10  Ask the blind worm the secrets of the grave, and why her spires

Love to curl round the bones of death; and ask the rav’nous snake

Where she gets poison: & the wing’d eagle why he loves the sun

And then tell me the thoughts of man, that have been hid of old.

Silent I hover all the night, and all day could be silent.

If Theotormon once would turn his loved eyes upon me;

How can I be defild when I reflect thy image pure?

Sweetest the fruit that the worm feeds on. & the soul prey’d on by woe

The new wash’d lamb ting’d with the village smoke & the bright swan

By the red earth of our immortal river: I bathe my wings.

20  And I am white and pure to hover round Theotormons breast.

Then Theotormon broke his silence. and he answered.

Tell me what is the night or day to one o’erflowd with woe?

Tell me what is a thought? & of what substance is it made?

Tell me what is a joy? & in what gardens do joys grow?

And in what rivers swim the sorrows? and upon what mountains

PLATE 4

Wave shadows of discontent? and in what houses dwell the wretched

Drunken with woe forgotten. and shut up from cold despair.

Tell me where dwell the thoughts forgotten till thou call them forth

Tell me where dwell the joys of old? & where the ancient loves?

And when will they renew again & the night of oblivion past?

That I might traverse times & spaces far remote and bring

Comforts into a present sorrow and a night of pain

Where goest thou O thought\! to what remote land is thy flight?

If thou returnest to the present moment of affliction

10  Wilt thou bring comforts on thy wings, and dews and honey and balm;

Or poison from the desart wilds, from the eyes of the envier.

Then Bromion said: and shook the cavern with his lamentation

Thou knowest that the ancient trees seen by thine eyes have fruit;

But knowest thou that trees and fruits flourish upon the earth

To gratify senses unknown? trees beasts and birds unknown:

Unknown, not unpercievd, spread in the infinite microscope,

In places yet unvisited by the voyager, and in worlds

Over another kind of seas, and in atmospheres unknown:

Ah\! are there other wars, beside the wars of sword and fire\!

20  And are there other sorrows, beside the sorrows of poverty\!

And are there other joys, beside the joys of riches and ease?

And is there not one law for both the lion and the ox?

And is there not eternal fire, and eternal chains?

To bind the phantoms of existence from eternal life?

Then Oothoon waited silent all the day. and all the night,

PLATE 5

But when the morn arose, her lamentation renewd,

The Daughters of Albion hear her woes, & eccho back her sighs.

O Urizen\! Creator of men\! mistaken Demon of heaven:

Thy joys are tears\! thy labour vain, to form men to thine image.

How can one joy absorb another? are not different joys

Holy, eternal, infinite\! and each joy is a Love.

Does not the great mouth laugh at a gift? & the narrow eyelids mock

At the labour that is above payment, and wilt thou take the ape

For thy councellor? or the dog, for a schoolmaster to thy children?

10  Does he who contemns poverty, and he who turns with abhorrence

From usury: feel the same passion or are they moved alike?

How can the giver of gifts experience the delights of the merchant?

How the industrious citizen the pains of the husbandman.

How different far the fat fed hireling with hollow drum;

Who buys whole corn fields into wastes, and sings upon the heath:

How different their eye and ear\! how different the world to them\!

With what sense does the parson claim the labour of the farmer?

What are his nets & gins & traps. & how does he surround him

With cold floods of abstraction, and with forests of solitude,

20  To build him castles and high spires. where kings & priests may dwell.

Till she who burns with youth. and knows no fixed lot; is bound

In spells of law to one she loaths: and must she drag the chain

Of life, in weary lust: must chilling murderous thoughts, obscure

The clear heaven of her eternal spring? to bear the wintry rage

Of a harsh terror driv’n to madness, bound to hold a rod

Over her shrinking shoulders all the day; & all the night

To turn the wheel of false desire: and longings that wake her womb

To the abhorred birth of cherubs in the human form

That live a pestilence & die a meteor & are no more.

30  Till the child dwell with one he hates. and do the deed he loaths

And the impure scourge force his seed into its unripe birth

E’er yet his eyelids can behold the arrows of the day.

Does the whale worship at thy footsteps as the hungry dog?

Or does he scent the mountain prey, because his nostrils wide

Draw in the ocean? does his eye discern the flying cloud

As the ravens eye? or does he measure the expanse like the vulture?

Does the still spider view the cliffs where eagles hide their young?

Or does the fly rejoice, because the harvest is brought in?

Does not the eagle scorn the earth & despise the treasures beneath?

But the mole knoweth what is there, & the worm shall tell it thee.

40  Does not the worm erect a pillar in the mouldering church yard?

PLATE 6

And a palace of eternity in the jaws of the hungry grave

Over his porch these words are written. Take thy bliss O Man\!

And sweet shall be thy taste & sweet thy infant joys renew\!

Infancy, fearless, lustful, happy\! nestling for delight

In laps of pleasure; Innocence\! honest, open, seeking

The vigorous joys of morning light; open to virgin bliss,

Who taught thee modesty, subtil modesty\! child of night & sleep

When thou awakest. wilt thou dissemble all thy secret joys

Or wert thou not, awake when all this mystery was disclos’d\!

10  Then com’st thou forth a modest virgin knowing to dissemble

With nets found under thy night pillow, to catch virgin joy,

And brand it with the name of whore; & sell it in the night,

In silence. ev’n without a whisper, and in seeming sleep:

Religious dreams and holy vespers, light thy smoky fires:

Once were thy fires lighted by the eyes of honest morn

And does my Theotormon seek this hypocrite modesty\!

This knowing, artful, secret, fearful, cautious, trembling hypocrite.

Then is Oothoon a whore indeed\! and all the virgin joys

Of life are harlots: and Theotormon is a sick mans dream

20  And Oothoon is the crafty slave of selfish holiness.

But Oothoon is not so, a virgin fill’d with virgin fancies

Open to joy and to delight where ever beauty appears

If in the morning sun I find it: there my eyes are fix’d

PLATE 7

In happy copulation; if in evening mild. wearied with work;

Sit on a bank and draw the pleasures of this free born joy.

The moment of desire\! the moment of desire\! The virgin

That pines for man; shall awaken her womb to enormous joys

In the secret shadows of her chamber; the youth shut up from

The lustful joy. shall forget to generate. & create an amorous image

In the shadows of his curtains and in the folds of his silent pillow.

Are not these the places of religion? the rewards of continence?

The self enjoyings of self denial? Why dost thou seek religion?

10  Is it because acts are not lovely, that thou seekest solitude,

Where the horrible darkness is impressed with reflections of desire.

Father of Jealousy. be thou accursed from the earth\!

Why hast thou taught my Theotormon this accursed thing?

Till beauty fades from off my shoulders darken’d and cast out,

A solitary shadow wailing on the margin of non-entity.

I cry, Love\! Love\! Love\! happy happy Love\! free as the mountain wind\!

Can that be Love, that drinks another as a sponge drinks water?

That clouds with jealousy his nights, with weepings all the day:

To spin a web of age around him. grey and hoary\! dark\!

20  Till his eyes sicken at the fruit that hangs. before his sight.

Such is self-love that envies all\! a creeping skeleton

With lamplike eyes watching around the frozen marriage bed.

But silken nets and traps of adamant will Oothoon spread,

And catch for thee girls of mild silver, or of furious gold;

I’ll lie beside thee on a bank & view their wanton play

In lovely copulation bliss on bliss with Theotormon:

Red as the rosy morning, lustful as the first born beam,

Oothoon shall view his dear delight, nor e’er with jealous cloud

Come in the heaven of generous love; nor selfish blightings bring.

30  Does the sun walk in glorious raiment. on the secret floor

PLATE 8

Where the cold miser spreads his gold? or does the bright cloud drop

On his stone threshold? does his eye behold the beam that brings

Expansion to the eye of pity? or will he bind himself

Beside the ox to thy hard furrow? does not that mild beam blot

The bat, the owl, the glowing tyger, and the king of night.

The sea fowl takes the wintry blast. for a cov’ring to her limbs:

And the wild snake, the pestilence to adorn him with gems & gold.

And trees. & birds. & beasts. & men. behold their eternal joy.

Arise you little glancing wings, and sing your infant joy\!

10  Arise and drink your bliss, for every thing that lives is holy\!

Thus every morning wails Oothoon. but Theotormon sits

Upon the margind ocean conversing with shadows dire.

The Daughters of Albion hear her woes, & eccho back her sighs.

The End



## ********AMERICA

A PROPHECY





PLATE 1



PRELUDIUM

The shadowy daughter of Urthona stood before red Orc.

When fourteen suns had faintly journey’d o’er his dark abode;

His food she brought in iron baskets, his drink in cups of iron;

Crown’d with a helmet & dark hair the nameless female stood;

A quiver with its burning stores, a bow like that of night,

When pestilence is shot from heaven; no other arms she need:

Invulnerable tho’ naked, save where clouds roll round her loins,

Their awful folds in the dark air; silent she stood as night;

For never from her iron tongue could voice or sound arise;

10   But dumb till that dread day when Orc assay’d his fierce embrace.

Dark virgin; said the hairy youth, thy father stern abhorr’d;

Rivets my tenfold chains while still on high my spirit soars;

Sometimes an eagle screaming in the sky, sometimes a lion,

Stalking upon the mountains, & sometimes a whale I lash

The raging fathomless abyss, anon a serpent folding

Around the pillars of Urthona, and round thy dark limbs,

On the Canadian wilds I fold, feeble my spirit folds.

For chaind beneath I rend these caverns; when thou bringest food

I howl my joy\! and my red eyes seek to behold thy face

20   In vain\! these clouds roll to & fro, & hide thee from my sight.

PLATE 2

Silent as despairing love, and strong as jealousy,

The hairy shoulders rend the links, free are the wrists of fire;

Round the terrific loins he siez’d the panting struggling womb;

It joy’d: she put aside her clouds & smiled her first-born smile;

As when a black cloud shews its light’nings to the silent deep.

Soon as she saw the terrible boy then burst the virgin cry.

I know thee, I have found thee, & I will not let thee go;

Thou art the image of God who dwells in darkness of Africa;

And thou art fall’n to give me life in regions of dark death.

10   On my American plains I feel the struggling afflictions

Endur’d by roots that writhe their arms into the nether deep:

I see a serpent in Canada, who courts me to his love;

In Mexico an Eagle, and a Lion in Peru;

I see a Whale in the South-sea, drinking my soul away.

O what limb rending pains I feel, thy fire & my frost

Mingle in howling pains, in furrows by thy lightnings rent;

This is eternal death; and this the torment long foretold.

The stern Bard ceas’d, asham’d of his own song; enrag’d he swung

His harp aloft sounding, then dash’d its shining frame against

20   A ruin’d pillar in glittring fragments; silent he turn’d away,

And wander’d down the vales of Kent in sick & drear lamentings.

PLATE 3

A PROPHECY

The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent,

Sullen fires across the Atlantic glow to America’s shore:

Piercing the souls of warlike men, who rise in silent night,

Washington, Franklin, Paine & Warren, Gates, Hancock & Green;

Meet on the coast glowing with blood from Albions fiery Prince.

Washington spoke; Friends of America look over the Atlantic sea;

A bended bow is lifted in heaven, & a heavy iron chain

Descends link by link from Albions cliffs across the sea to bind

Brothers & sons of America, till our faces pale and yellow;

10   Heads deprest, voices weak, eyes downcast, hands work-bruis’d,

Feet bleeding on the sultry sands, and the furrows of the whip

Descend to generations that in future times forget. –

The strong voice ceas’d; for a terrible blast swept over the heaving sea;

The eastern cloud rent; on his cliffs stood Albions wrathful Prince

A dragon form clashing his scales at midnight he arose,

And flam’d red meteors round the land of Albion beneath\[.\]

His voice, his locks, his awful shoulders, and his glowing eyes,

PLATE 4

Appear to the Americans upon the cloudy night.

Solemn heave the Atlantic waves between the gloomy nations,

Swelling, belching from its deeps red clouds & raging Fires\!

Albion is sick\! America faints\! enrag’d the Zenith grew.

As human blood shooting its veins all round the orbed heaven

Red rose the clouds from the Atlantic in vast wheels of blood

And in the red clouds rose a Wonder o’er the Atlantic sea;

Intense\! naked\! a Human fire fierce glowing, as the wedge

Of iron heated in the furnace; his terrible limbs were fire

10   With myriads of cloudy terrors banners dark & towers

Surrounded; heat but not light went thro’ the murky atmosphere

The King of England looking westward trembles at the vision

PLATE 5

Albions Angel stood beside the Stone of night, and saw

The terror like a comet, or more like the planet red

That once inclos’d the terrible wandering comets in its sphere.

Then Mars thou wast our center, & the planets three flew round

Thy crimson disk; so e’er the Sun was rent from thy red sphere;

The Spectre glowd his horrid length staining the temple long

With beams of blood; & thus a voice came forth, and shook the temple

PLATE 6

The morning comes, the night decays, the watchmen leave their stations;

The grave is burst, the spices shed, the linen wrapped up;

The bones of death, the cov’ring clay, the sinews shrunk & dry’d.

Reviving shake, inspiring move, breathing\! awakening\!

Spring like redeemed captives when their bonds & bars are burst;

Let the slave grinding at the mill, run out into the field:

Let him look up into the heavens & laugh in the bright air;

Let the inchained soul shut up in darkness and in sighing,

Whose face has never seen a smile in thirty weary years;

10   Rise and look out, his chains are loose, his dungeon doors are open.

And let his wife and children return from the opressors scourge;

They look behind at every step & believe it is a dream.

Singing. The Sun has left his blackness, & has found a fresher morning

And the fair Moon rejoices in the clear & cloudless night;

For Empire is no more, and now the Lion & Wolf shall cease.

PLATE 7

In thunders ends the voice. Then Albions Angel wrathful burnt

Beside the Stone of Night; and like the Eternal Lions howl

In famine & war, reply’d. Art thou not Orc; who serpent-form’d

Stands at the gate of Enitharmon to devour her children;

Blasphemous Demon, Antichrist, hater of Dignities;

Lover of wild rebellion, and transgresser of Gods Law;

Why dost thou come to Angels eyes in this terrific form?

PLATE 8

The terror answerd: I am Orc, wreath’d round the accursed tree:

The times are ended; shadows pass the morning gins to break;

The fiery joy, that Urizen perverted to ten commands,

What night he led the starry hosts thro’ the wide wilderness:

That stony law I stamp to dust: and scatter religion abroad

To the four winds as a torn book, & none shall gather the leaves;

But they shall rot on desart sands, & consume in bottomless deeps;

To make the desarts blossom, & the deeps shrink to their fountains,

And to renew the fiery joy, and burst the stony roof.

10   That pale religious letchery, seeking Virginity,

May find it in a harlot, and in coarse-clad honesty

The undefil’d tho’ ravish’d in her cradle night and morn:

For every thing that lives is holy, life delights in life;

Because the soul of sweet delight can never be defil’d.

Fires inwrap the earthly globe, yet man is not consumd;

Amidst the lustful fires he walks: his feet become like brass,

His knees and thighs like silver, & his breast and head like gold.

PLATE 9

Sound\! sound\! my loud war-trumpets & alarm my Thirteen Angels\!

Loud howls the eternal Wolf\! the eternal Lion lashes his tail\!

America is darkned; and my punishing Demons terrified

Crouch howling before their caverns deep like skins dry’d in the wind.

They cannot smite the wheat, nor quench the fatness of the earth.

They cannot smite with sorrows, nor subdue the plow and spade.

They cannot wall the city, nor moat round the castle of princes.

They cannot bring the stubbed oak to overgrow the hills.

For terrible men stand on the shores, & in their robes I see

10   Children take shelter from the lightnings, there stands Washington

And Paine and Warren with their foreheads reard toward the east

But clouds obscure my aged sight. A vision from afar\!

Sound\! sound\! my loud war-trumpets & alarm my thirteen Angels:

Ah vision from afar\! Ah rebel form that rent the ancient

Heavens; Eternal Viper self-renew’d, rolling in clouds

I see thee in thick clouds and darkness on America’s shore.

Writhing in pangs of abhorred birth; red flames the crest rebellious

And eyes of death; the harlot womb oft opened in vain

Heaves in enormous circles, now the times are return’d upon thee,

20   Devourer of thy parent, now thy unutterable torment renews.

Sound\! sound\! my loud war-trumpets & alarm my thirteen Angels\!

Ah terrible birth\! a young one bursting\! where is the weeping mouth?

And where the mothers milk? instead those ever-hissing jaws

And parched lips drop with fresh gore; now roll thou in the clouds

Thy mother lays her length outstretch’d upon the shore beneath.

Sound\! sound\! my loud war-trumpets & alarm my thirteen Angels\!

Loud howls the eternal Wolf: the eternal Lion lashes his tail\!

PLATE 10

Thus wept the Angel voice & as he wept the terrible blasts

Of trumpets, blew a loud alarm across the Atlantic deep.

No trumpets answer; no reply of clarions or of fifes,

Silent the Colonies remain and refuse the loud alarm.

On those vast shady hills between America & Albions shore;

Now barr’d out by the Atlantic sea: call’d Atlantean hills:

Because from their bright summits you may pass to the Golden world

An ancient palace, archetype of mighty Emperies,

Rears its immortal pinnacles, built in the forest of God

10   By Ariston the king of beauty for his stolen bride,

Here on their magic seats the thirteen Angels sat perturb’d

For clouds from the Atlantic hover o’er the solemn roof.

PLATE 11

Fiery the Angels rose, & as they rose deep thunder roll’d

Around their shores: indignant burning with the fires of Orc

And Bostons Angel cried aloud as they flew thro’ the dark night.

He cried: Why trembles honesty and like a murderer,

Why seeks he refuge from the frowns of his immortal station\!

Must the generous tremble & leave his joy, to the idle: to the pestilence\!

That mock him? who commanded this? what God? what Angel\!

To keep the gen’rous from experience till the ungenerous

Are unrestraind performers of the energies of nature;

10   Till pity is become a trade, and generosity a science,

That men get rich by, & the sandy desart is giv’n to the strong

What God is he, writes laws of peace, & clothes him in a tempest

What pitying Angel lusts for tears, and fans himself with sighs

What crawling villain preaches abstinence & wraps himself

In fat of lambs? no more I follow, no more obedience pay.

PLATE 12

So cried he, rending off his robe & throwing down his scepter.

In sight of Albions Guardian, and all the thirteen Angels

Rent off their robes to the hungry wind, & threw their golden scepters

Down on the land of America, indignant they descended

Headlong from out their heav’nly heights, descending swift as fires

Over the land; naked & flaming are their lineaments seen

In the deep gloom, by Washington & Paine & Warren they stood

And the flame folded roaring fierce within the pitchy night

Before the Demon red, who burnt towards America,

10   In black smoke thunders and loud winds rejoicing in its terror

Breaking in smoky wreaths from the wild deep, & gath’ring thick

In flames as of a furnace on the land from North to South

PLATE 13

What time the thirteen Governors that England sent convene

In Bernards house; the flames coverd the land, they rouze they cry

Shaking their mental chains they rush in fury to the sea

To quench their anguish; at the feet of Washington down fall’n

They grovel on the sand and writhing lie, while all

The British soldiers thro’ the thirteen states sent up a howl

Of anguish: threw their swords & muskets to the earth & ran

From their encampments and dark castles seeking where to hide

From the grim flames; and from the visions of Orc: in sight

10    Of Albions Angel; who enrag’d his secret clouds open’d

From north to south, and burnt outstretchd on wings of wrath cov’ring

The eastern sky, spreading his awful wings across the heavens;

Beneath him roll’d his num’rous hosts, all Albions Angels camp’d

Darkend the Atlantic mountains & their trumpets shook the valleys

Arm’d with diseases of the earth to cast upon the Abyss,

Their numbers forty millions, must’ring in the eastern sky.

PLATE 14

In the flames stood & view’d the armies drawn out in the sky

Washington Franklin Paine & Warren Allen Gates & Lee:

And heard the voice of Albions Angel give the thunderous command:

His plagues obedient to his voice flew forth out of their clouds

Falling upon America, as a storm to cut them off

As a blight cuts the tender corn when it begins to appear.

Dark is the heaven above, & cold & hard the earth beneath;

And as a plague wind fill’d with insects cuts off man & beast;

And as a sea o’erwhelms a land in the day of an earthquake:

10  Fury\! rage\! madness\! in a wind swept through America

And the red flames of Orc that folded roaring fierce around

The angry shores, and the fierce rushing of th’inhabitants together:

The citizens of New-York close their books & lock their chests;

The mariners of Boston drop their anchors and unlade;

The scribe of Pensylvania casts his pen upon the earth;

The builder of Virginia throws his hammer down in fear.

Then had America been lost, o’erwhelm’d by the Atlantic,

And Earth had lost another portion of the infinite,

But all rush together in the night in wrath and raging fire

20  The red fires rag’d\! the plagues recoil’d\! then rolld they  
       back with fury

PLATE 15

On Albions Angels; then the Pestilence began in streaks of red

Across the limbs of Albions Guardian, the spotted plague smote Bristols

And the Leprosy Londons Spirit, sickening all their bands:

The millions sent up a howl of anguish and threw off their hammerd mail,

And cast their swords & spears to earth, & stood a naked multitude.

Albions Guardian writhed in torment on the eastern sky

Pale quivring toward the brain his glimmering eyes, teeth chattering

Howling & shuddering his legs quivering; convuls’d each muscle & sinew

Sick’ning lay Londons Guardian, and the ancient miter’d York

10 Their heads on snowy hills, their ensigns sick’ning in the sky

The plagues creep on the burning winds driven by flames of Orc,

And by the fierce Americans rushing together in the night

Driven o’er the Guardians of Ireland and Scotland and Wales

They spotted with plagues forsook the frontiers & their banners seard

With fires of hell, deform their ancient heavens with shame & woe.

Hid in his caves the Bard of Albion felt the enormous plagues.

And a cowl of flesh grew o’er his head & scales on his back & ribs;

And rough with black scales all his Angels fright their ancient heavens

The doors of marriage are open, and the Priests in rustling scales

20 Rush into reptile coverts, hiding from the fires of Orc,

That play around the golden roofs in wreaths of fierce desire,

Leaving the females naked and glowing with the lusts of youth

For the female spirits of the dead pining in bonds of religion;

Run from their fetters reddening, & in long drawn arches sitting:

They feel the nerves of youth renew, and desires of ancient times,

Over their pale limbs as a vine when the tender grape appears

PLATE 16

Over the hills, the vales, the cities, rage the red flames fierce;

The Heavens melted from north to south; and Urizen who sat

Above all heavens in thunders wrap’d, emerg’d his leprous head

From out his holy shrine, his tears in deluge piteous

Falling into the deep sublime\! flag’d with grey-brow’d snows

And thunderous visages, his jealous wings wav’d over the deep;

Weeping in dismal howling woe he dark descended howling

Around the smitten bands, clothed in tears & trembling shudd’ring cold.

His stored snows he poured forth, and his icy magazines

10 He open’d on the deep, and on the Atlantic sea white shiv’ring.

Leprous his limbs, all over white, and hoary was his visage.

Weeping in dismal howlings before the stern Americans

Hiding the Demon red with clouds & cold mists from the earth;

Till Angels & weak men twelve years should govern o’er the strong:

And then their end should come, when France reciev’d the Demons light.

Stiff shudderings shook the heav’nly thrones\! France Spain & Italy,

In terror view’d the bands of Albion, and the ancient Guardians

Fainting upon the elements, smitten with their own plagues

They slow advance to shut the five gates of their lawbuilt heaven

20 Filled with blasting fancies and with mildews of despair

With fierce disease and lust, unable to stem the fires of Orc;

But the five gates were consum’d, & their bolts and hinges melted

And the fierce flames burnt round the heavens, & round the abodes of men

FINIS

\[CANCELLED PLATES\]

PLATE \[b\]

Reveal the dragon thro’ the human; coursing swift as fire

To the close hall of counsel, where his Angel form renews.

In a sweet vale shelter’d with cedars, that eternal stretch

Their unmov’d branches, stood the hall; built when the moon shot forth,

In that dread night when Urizen call’d the stars round his feet;

Then burst the center from its orb, and found a place beneath;

And Earth conglob’d, in narrow room, roll’d round its sulphur Sun.

To this deep valley situated by the flowing Thames;

Where George the third holds council. & his Lords & Commons meet:

10 Shut out from mortal sight the Angel came; the vale was dark

With clouds of smoke from the Atlantic, that in volumes roll’d

Between the mountains, dismal visions mope around the house.

On chairs of iron, canopied with mystic ornaments

Of life by magic power condens’d; infernal forms art-bound

The council sat; all rose before the aged apparition;

His snowy beard that streams like lambent flames down his wide breast

Wetting with tears, & his white garments cast a wintry light.

Then as arm’d clouds arise terrific round the northern drum;

The world is silent at the flapping of the folding banners;

20 So still terrors rent the house: as when the solemn globe

Launch’d to the unknown shore, while Sotha held the northern helm,

Till to that void it came & fell; so the dark house was rent,

The valley mov’d beneath; its shining pillars split in twain,

And its roofs crack across down falling on th’ Angelic seats.

PLATE \[c\]

\[*Then Albions Angel rose*\] resolv’d to the cove of armoury:

His shield that bound twelve demons & their cities in its orb,

He took down from its trembling pillar; from its cavern deep,

His helm was brought by Londons Guardian, & his thirsty spear

By the wise spirit of Londons river: silent stood the  
    King breathing \[*with flames/hoar frosts*\] damp mists:

And on his \[*shining*\] aged limbs they clasp’d the armour of terrible gold.

Infinite Londons awful spires cast a dreadful \[*gleam*\] cold

Even on rational things beneath, and from the palace walls

Around Saint James’s \[*glow the fires/till by the freeze*\]  
chill & heavy, even to the city gate.

10 On the vast stone whose name is Truth he stood, his cloudy shield

Smote with his scepter, the scale bound orb loud howld;  
th’ \[*eternal*\] ancie\[nt\] pillar

Trembling sunk, an earthquake roll’d along the mossy pile.

In glittring armour, swift as winds; intelligent as \[*flames*\] clouds;

Four winged heralds mount the furious blasts & blow their trumps

Gold, silver, brass & iron \[*ardors*\] clangors clamoring rend the shores.

Like white clouds rising from the deeps, his fifty-two armies

From the four cliffs of Albion rise, \[*glowing*\] mustering  
  around their Prince;

Angels of cities and of parishes and villages and families,

In armour as the nerves of wisdom, each his station holds.

20 In opposition dire, a warlike cloud the myriads stood

In the red air before the Demon; \[*seen even by mortal men:*

*Who call it Fancy, or shut the gates of sense* & *in their chambers*,

*Sleep like the dead.*\] But like a constellation ris’n and blazing

Over the rugged ocean; so the Angels of Albion hung

\[*Over the frowning shadow, like a King*\]

a frowning shadow, like an aged King in arms of gold,

Who wept over a den, in which his only son outstretch’d

By rebels hands was slain; his white beard wav’d in the wild wind.

On mountains & cliffs of snow the awful apparition hover’d;

30 And like the voices of religious dead, heard in the mountains:

When holy zeal scents the sweet valleys of ripe virgin bliss;

Such was the hollow voice that o’er \[*the red demon*\] America lamented.

\[FRAGMENT\]

As when a dream of Thiralatha flies the midnight hour:

In vain the dreamer grasps the joyful images, they fly

Seen in obscured traces in the Vale of Leutha, So

The British Colonies beneath the woful Princes fade.

And so the Princes fade from earth, scarce seen by souls of men

But tho’ obscur’d, this is the form of the Angelic land.

A PROPHECY





PLATE iii

Five windows light the cavern’d Man; thro’ one he breathes the air;

Thro’ one, hears music of the spheres; thro’ one, the eternal vine

Flourishes, that he may recieve the grapes; thro’ one can look.

And see small portions of the eternal world that ever groweth;

Thro’ one, himself pass out what time he please, but he will not;

For stolen joys are sweet, & bread eaten in secret pleasant.



So sang a Fairy mocking as he sat on a streak’d Tulip,

Thinking none saw him: when he ceas’d I started from the trees\!

And caught him in my hat as boys knock down a butterfly

How know you this said I small Sir? where did you

10   learn this song

Seeing himself in my possession thus he answered me:

My master, I am yours. command me, for I must obey.



Then tell me, what is the material world, and is it dead?

He laughing answer’d: I will write a book on leaves of flowers,

If you will feed me on love-thoughts, & give me now and then

A cup of sparkling poetic fancies; so when I am tipsie,

I’ll sing to you to this soft lute; and shew you all alive

The world, when every particle of dust breathes forth its joy.

I took him home in my warm bosom: as we went along

Wild flowers I gatherd; & he shew’d me each eternal

20   flower:

He laugh’d aloud to see them whimper because they were pluck’d.

They hover’d round me like a cloud of incense: when I came

Into my parlour and sat down, and took my pen to write:

My Fairy sat upon the table, and dictated EUROPE.



PLATE 1

PRELUDIUM

The nameless shadowy female rose from out the breast of Orc:

Her snaky hair brandishing in the winds of Enitharmon;

And thus her voice arose.



O mother Enitharmon wilt thou bring forth other sons?

To cause my name to vanish, that my place may not be found.

For I am faint with travel\!

Like the dark cloud disburdend in the day of dismal thunder.



 My roots are brandish’d in the heavens. my fruits in earth beneath

Surge, foam, and labour into life, first born & first consum’d\!

10  Consumed and consuming\!

Then why shouldst thou accursed mother bring me into life?



 I wrap my turban of thick clouds around my lab’ring head;

And fold the sheety waters as a mantle round my limbs.

Yet the red sun and moon,

And all the overflowing stars rain down prolific pains.



PLATE 2

Unwilling I look up to heaven\! unwilling count the stars\!

Sitting in fathomless abyss of my immortal shrine.

I sieze their burning power

And bring forth howling terrors, all devouring fiery kings.



 Devouring & devoured roaming on dark and desolate mountains

In forests of eternal death, shrieking in hollow trees.

Ah mother Enitharmon\!

Stamp not with solid form this vig’rous progeny of fires.



I bring forth from my teeming bosom myriads of flames.

And thou dost stamp them with a signet, then they

10   roam abroad

And leave me void as death:

Ah\! I am drown’d in shady woe, and visionary joy.



And who shall bind the infinite with an eternal band?

To compass it with swaddling bands? and who shall cherish it

With milk and honey?

I see it smile & I roll inward & my voice is past.

She ceast & rolld her shady clouds  
    Into the secret place.



PLATE 3

A PROPHECY

          The deep of winter came;  
          What time the secret child,

Descended thro’ the orient gates of the eternal day:

War ceas’d, & all the troops like shadows fled to their abodes.

Then Enitharmon saw her sons & daughters rise around.

Like pearly clouds they meet together in the crystal house:

And Los, possessor of the moon, joy’d in the peaceful night:

Thus speaking while his num’rous sons shook their bright fiery wings



 Again the night is come

10 That strong Urthona takes his rest,  
And Urizen unloos’d from chains  
Glows like a meteor in the distant north  
Stretch forth your hands and strike the elemental strings\!  
Awake the thunders of the deep,

PLATE 4

The shrill winds wake\!

Till all the sons of Urizen look out and envy Los:

Sieze all the spirits of life and bind

Their warbling joys to our loud strings

Bind all the nourishing sweets of earth

To give us bliss, that we may drink the sparkling wine of Los

And let us laugh at war,

Despising toil and care,

Because the days and nights of joy, in lucky hours renew.

10 Arise O Orc from thy deep den,

First born of Enitharmon rise\!

And we will crown thy head with garlands of the ruddy vine;

For now thou art bound;

And I may see thee in the hour of bliss, my eldest born.



The horrent Demon rose, surrounded with red stars of fire,

Whirling about in furious circles round the immortal fiend.

Then Enitharmon down descended into his red light,

And thus her voice rose to her children, the distant heavens reply:



PLATE 6

Now comes the night of Enitharmons joy\!  
Who shall I call? Who shall I send?  
That Woman, lovely Woman\! may have dominion?  
Arise O Rintrah thee I call\! & Palamabron thee\!  
Go\! tell the Human race that Womans love is Sin\!  
That an Eternal life awaits the worms of sixty winters  
In an allegorical abode where existence hath never come:  
Forbid all Joy, & from her childhood shall the little  
    female  
Spread nets in every secret path.

10 My weary eyelids draw towards the evening, my bliss is yet but new.



PLATE 8

Arise O Rintrah eldest born: second to none but Orc:  
O lion Rintrah raise thy fury from thy forests black:  
Bring Palamabron horned priest, skipping upon the  
    mountains:  
And silent Elynittria the silver bowed queen:  
Rintrah where hast thou hid thy bride:  
Weeps she in desart shades?  
Alas my Rintrah\! bring the lovely jealous Ocalythron.



Arise my son: bring all thy brethren O thou king of fire.

Prince of the sun I see thee with thy innumerable race:

10 Thick as the summer stars:

But each ramping his golden mane shakes,  
And thine eyes rejoice because of strength O Rintrah  
    furious king



PLATE 9

Enitharmon slept,  
Eighteen hundred years: Man was a Dream\!  
The night of Nature and their harps unstrung:   
She slept in middle of her nightly song,  
Eighteen hundred years, a female dream\!

![Image](images/000000.jpg)



Shadows of men in fleeting bands upon the winds:

Divide the heavens of Europe:  
Till Albions Angel smitten with his own plagues fled  
    with his bands  
The cloud bears hard on Albions shore:

10 Fill’d with immortal demons of futurity:

In council gather the smitten Angels of Albion  
The cloud bears hard upon the council house; down  
    rushing  
On the heads of Albions Angels.



One hour they lay buried beneath the ruins of that hall;

But as the stars rise from the salt lake they arise in pain,  
In troubled mists o’erclouded by the terrors of  
    strugling times.

PLATE 10

In thoughts perturb’d. they rose from the bright ruins silent following

The fiery King, who sought his ancient temple serpent-form’d

That stretches out its shady length along the Island white.

Round him roll’d his clouds of war; silent the Angel went,

Along the infinite shores of Thames to golden Verulam.

There stand the venerable porches that high-towering rear

Their oak-surrounded pillars, form’d of massy stones, uncut

With tool; stones precious; such eternal in the heavens,

Of colours twelve. few known on earth, give light in the opake,

Plac’d in the order of the stars, when the five senses

10 whelm’d

In deluge o’er the earth-born man; then turn’d the fluxile eyes

Into two stationary orbs, concentrating all things.

The ever-varying spiral ascents to the heavens of heavens

Were bended downward; and the nostrils golden gates shut

Turn’d outward, barr’d and petrify’d against the infinite,



Thought chang’d the infinite to a serpent; that which pitieth:

To a devouring flame; and man fled from its face and hid

In forests of night; then all the eternal forests were divided

Into earths rolling in circles of space, that like an ocean rush’d

20 And overwhelmed all except this finite wall of flesh.

Then was the serpent temple form’d, image of infinite

Shut up in finite revolutions, and man became an Angel;

Heaven a mighty circle turning; God a tyrant crown’d.



Now arriv’d the ancient Guardian at the southern porch,

That planted thick with trees of blackest leaf, & in a vale

Obscure, enclos’d the Stone of Night; oblique it stood, o’erhung

With purple flowers and berries red; image of that sweet south,

Once open to the heavens and elevated on the human neck,

Now overgrown with hair and covered with a stony roof,

Downward ’tis sunk beneath th’ attractive north, that

30 round the feet

A raging whirlpool draws the dizzy enquirer to his grave:

PLATE II

    Albions Angel rose upon the Stone of Night.  
    He saw Urizen on the Atlantic;  
    And his brazen Book,  
    That Kings & Priests had copied on Earth  
    Expanded from North to South.



PLATE 12

And the clouds & fires pale rolld round in the night of Enitharmon

Round Albions cliffs & Londons walls; still Enitharmon slept\!

Rolling volumes of grey mist involve Churches, Palaces, Towers:

For Urizen unclaspd his Book\! feeding his soul with pity

The youth of England hid in gloom curse the paind heavens; compell’d

Into the deadly night to see the form of Albions Angel

Their parents brought them forth & aged ignorance preaches canting,

On a vast rock, percievd by those senses that are clos’d from thought:

Bleak, dark, abrupt, it stands & overshadows London city

They saw his boney feet on the rock, the flesh consum’d in

10 flames:

They saw the Serpent temple lifted above, shadowing the Island white:

They heard the voice of Albions Angel howling in flames of Orc,

Seeking the trump of the last doom



Above the rest the howl was heard from Westminster louder & louder:

The Guardian of the secret codes forsook his ancient mansion,

Driven out by the flames of Orc; his furr’d robes & false locks

Adhered and grew one with his flesh, and nerves & veins shot thro’ them

With dismal torment sick, hanging upon the wind: he fled

Groveling along Great George Street thro’ the Park gate; all the soldiers

Fled from his sight: he drag’d his torments to the

20   wilderness.



Thus was the howl thro Europe\!

For Orc rejoic’d to hear the howling shadows

But Palamabron shot his lightnings trenching down his wide back

And Rintrah hung with all his legions in the nether deep



Enitharmon laugh’d in her sleep to see \(O womans triumph\)

Every house a den, every man bound; the shadows are filld

With spectres, and the windows wove over with curses of iron:

Over the doors Thou shalt not; & over the chimneys Fear is written:

With bands of iron round their necks fasten’d into the walls

30 The citizens: in leaden gyves the inhabitants of suburbs

Walk heavy: soft and bent are the bones of villagers



Between the clouds of Urizen the flames of Orc roll heavy

Around the limbs of Albions Guardian, his flesh consuming.

Howlings & hissings, shrieks & groans, & voices of despair

Arise around him in the cloudy

Heavens of Albion, Furious

PLATE 13

The red limb’d Angel siez’d, in horror and torment;

The Trump of the last doom; but he could not blow the iron tube\!

Thrice he assay’d presumptuous to awake the dead to Judgment.

A mighty Spirit leap’d from the land of Albion,

![Image](images/000000.jpg)

Nam’d Newton; he siez’d the Trump. & blow’d the enormous blast\!

Yellow as leaves of Autumn the myriads of Angelic hosts,

Fell thro’ the wintry skies seeking their graves;

Rattling their hollow bones in howling and lamentation.



       Then Enitharmon woke, nor knew that she had slept

10 And eighteen hundred years were fled

As if they had not been  
She calld her sons & daughters  
To the sports of night,  
Within her crystal house;  
And thus her song proceeds.



Arise Ethinthus\! tho’ the earth-worm call;

Let him call in vain;  
Till the night of holy shadows  
And human solitude is past\!

PLATE 14

Ethinthus queen of waters, how thou shinest in the sky:

My daughter how do I rejoice\! for thy children flock around

Like the gay fishes on the wave, when the cold moon drinks the dew.

Ethinthus\! thou art sweet as comforts to my fainting soul:

For now thy waters warble round the feet of Enitharmon.



Manathu-Vorcyon\! I behold thee flaming in my halls,

Light of thy mothers soul\! I see thy lovely eagles round;

Thy golden wings are my delight, & thy flames of soft delusion.



Where is my lureing bird of Eden\! Leutha silent love\!

10 Leutha, the many colourd bow delights upon thy wings:

Soft soul of flowers Leutha\!  
Sweet smiling pestilence\! I see thy blushing light:  
Thy daughters many changing,  
Revolve like sweet perfumes ascending O Leutha silken  
   queen\!

Where is the youthful Antamon. prince of the pearly dew.

O Antamon. why wilt thou leave thy mother Enitharmon?

Alone I see thee crystal form.

Floting upon the bosomd air:

With lineaments of gratified desire.

20 My Antamon the seven churches of Leutha seek thy love.



I hear the soft Oothoon in Enitharmons tents:

Why wilt thou give up womans secrecy my melancholy child?

Between two moments bliss is ripe:

O Theotormon robb’d of joy, I see thy salt tears flow

Down the steps of my crystal house.



Sotha & Thiralatha, secret dwellers of dreamful caves,

Arise and please the horrent fiend with your melodious songs.

Still all your thunders golden hoofd, & bind your horses black.

Orc\! smile upon my children\!

30 Smile son of my afflictions.

Arise O Orc and give our mountains joy of thy red light.



She ceas’d, for All were forth at sport beneath the solemn moon

Waking the stars of Urizen with their immortal songs,

That nature felt thro’ all her pores the enormous revelry,

Till morning ope’d the eastern gate.

Then every one fled to his station. & Enitharmon wept.

But terrible Orc, when he beheld the morning in the east,

PLATE 15

Shot from the heights of Enitharmon;

And in the vineyards of red France appear’d the light of his fury



The sun glow’d fiery red\!

The furious terrors flew around\!

On golden chariots raging, with red wheels dropping with blood;

The Lions lash their wrathful tails\!

The Tigers couch upon the prey & suck the ruddy tide:

And Enitharmon groans & cries in anguish and dismay.



Then Los arose his head he reard in snaky thunders clad:

10 And with a cry that shook all nature to the utmost pole,

Call’d all his sons to the strife of blood.

                                                     FINIS



## ********THE SONG OF LOS





PLATE 3



### ******AFRICA**

*I will sing you a song of Los. the Eternal Prophet*:

*He sung it to four harps at the tables of Eternity.*

      *In heart-formed Africa.*

*Urizen faded\! Ariston shudderd\!*

      *And thus the Song began*

Adam stood in the garden of Eden:  
And Noah on the mountains of Ararat;  
They saw Urizen give his Laws to the Nations  
By the hands of the children of Los.

10  Adam shudderd\! Noah faded\! black grew the sunny African

When Rintrah gave Abstract Philosophy to Brama in the East:

\(Night spoke to the Cloud\!

Lo these Human form’d spirits in smiling hipocrisy War

Against one another; so let them War on; slaves to the eternal Elements\)

Noah shrunk, beneath the waters;

Abram fled in fires from Chaldea;

Moses beheld upon Mount Sinai forms of dark delusion:

To Trismegistus. Palamabron gave an abstract Law:

To Pythagoras Socrates & Plato.

20  Times rolled on o’er all the sons of Har, time after time

Orc on Mount Atlas howld, chain’d down with the Chain of Jealousy

Then Oothoon hoverd over Judah & Jerusalem

And Jesus heard her voice \(a man of sorrows\) he recievd

A Gospel from wretched Theotormon.

The human race began to wither, for the healthy built

Secluded places, fearing the joys of Love

And the disease’d only propagated:

So Antamon call’d up Leutha from her valleys of delight:

And to Mahomet a loose Bible gave.

30  But in the North, to Odin, Sotha gave a Code of War,

Because of Diralada thinking to reclaim his joy.

PLATE 4

These were the Churches: Hospitals: Castles: Palaces:

Like nets & gins & traps to catch the joys of Eternity And all the rest a desart;

Till like a dream Eternity was obliterated & erased.

Since that dread day when Har and Heva fled.

Because their brethren & sisters liv’d in War & Lust;

And as they fled they shrunk

Into two narrow doleful forms:

Creeping in reptile flesh upon

10  The bosom of the ground:

And all the vast of Nature shrunk

Before their shrunken eyes.

Thus the terrible race of Los & Enitharmon gave

Laws & Religions to the sons of Har binding them more

And more to Earth: closing and restraining:

Till a Philosophy of Five Senses was complete

Urizen wept & gave it into the hands of Newton & Locke

Clouds roll heavy upon the Alps round Rousseau & Voltaire:

And on the mountains of Lebanon round the deceased Gods

20  Of Asia; & on the desarts of Africa round the Fallen Angels

The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent



PLATE 6



### ******ASIA**

The Kings of Asia heard

The howl rise up from Europe\!

And each ran out from his Web;

From his ancient woven Den;

For the darkness of Asia was startled

At the thick-flaming, thought-creating fires of Orc.

And the Kings of Asia stood

And cried in bitterness of soul.

Shall not the King call for Famine from the heath?

10  Nor the Priest, for Pestilence from the fen?

To restrain\! to dismay\! to thin\!

The inhabitants of mountain and plain;

In the day, of full-feeding prosperity;

And the night of delicious songs.

Shall not the Councellor throw his curb

Of Poverty on the laborious?

To fix the price of labour;

To invent allegoric riches:

And the privy admonishers of men

20  Call for fires in the City

For heaps of smoking ruins,

In the night of prosperity & wantonness

To turn man from his path,

To restrain the child from the womb,

PLATE 7

To cut off the bread from the city,

That the remnant may learn to obey,

That the pride of the heart may fail;

That the lust of the eyes, may be quench’d:

That the delicate ear in its infancy

May be dull’d; and the nostrils clos’d up;

To teach mortal worms the path

That leads from the gates of the Grave.

Urizen heard them cry\!

10  And his shudd’ring waving wings

Went enormous above the red flames

Drawing clouds of despair thro’ the heavens

Of Europe as he went:

And his Books of brass iron & gold

Melted over the land as he flew,

Heavy-waving, howling, weeping.

And he stood over Judea:

And stay’d in his ancient place:

And stretch’d his clouds over Jerusalem;

20  For Adam, a mouldering skeleton

Lay bleach’d on the garden of Eden;

And Noah as white as snow

On the mountains of Ararat.

Then the thunders of Urizen bellow’d aloud

From his woven darkness above.

Orc, raging in European darkness

Arose like a pillar of fire above the Alps

Like a serpent of fiery flame\!

      The sullen Earth

30         Shrunk\!

Forth from the dead dust rattling bones to bones

Join: shaking convuls’d the shivring clay breathes

And all flesh naked stands: Fathers and Friends;

Mothers & Infants; Kings & Warriors:

The Grave shrieks with delight, & shakes

Her hollow womb, & clasps the solid stem:

Her bosom swells with wild desire:

And milk & blood & glandous wine

In rivers rush & shout & dance,

40  On mountain, dale and plain.

The SONG of LOS is Ended.

    Urizen Wept.



## ********THE \[***FIRST***\] BOOK OF URIZEN





PLATE 2



PRELUDIUM TO THE \[*FIRST*\] BOOK OF URIZEN

Of the primeval Priests assum’d power,

When Eternals spurn’d back his religion;

And gave him place in the north,

Obscure, shadowy, void, solitary.

Eternals I hear your call gladly,

Dictate swift winged words, & fear not

To unfold your dark visions of torment.



PLATE 3

CHAP: I

1. Lo, a shadow of horror is risen

In Eternity\! Unknown, unprolific\!

Self-closed, all-repelling: what Demon

Hath form’d this abominable void

This soul-shudd’ring vacuum? – Some said

’It is Urizen’, But unknown, abstracted

Brooding secret, the dark power hid.

2. Times on times he divided, & measur’d

Space by space in his ninefold darkness

10   Unseen, unknown\! changes appeard

In his desolate mountains rifted furious

By the black winds of perturbation

3. For he strove in battles dire

In unseen conflictions with shapes

Bred from his forsaken wilderness,

Of beast, bird, fish, serpent & element

Combustion, blast, vapour and cloud.

4. Dark revolving in silent activity:

Unseen in tormenting passions;

20   An activity unknown and horrible;

A self-contemplating shadow,

In enormous labours occupied

5. But Eternals beheld his vast forests

Age on ages he lay, clos’d, unknown,

Brooding shut in the deep; all avoid

The petrific abominable chaos

6. His cold horrors silent, dark Urizen

Prepar’d: his ten thousands of thunders

Rang’d in gloom’d array stretch out across

30   The dread world, & the rolling of wheels

As of swelling seas, sound in his clouds

In his hills of stor’d snows, in his mountains

Of hail & ice; voices of terror,

Are heard, like thunders of autumn,

When the cloud blazes over the harvests



CHAP: II

1. Earth was not: nor globes of attraction

The will of the Immortal expanded

Or contracted his all flexible senses.

Death was not, but eternal life sprung

40   2. The sound of a trumpet the heavens

Awoke & vast clouds of blood roll’d

Round the dim rocks of Urizen, so nam’d

That solitary one in Immensity

3. Shrill the trumpet: & myriads of Eternity,

PLATE 4

Muster around the bleak desarts

Now fill’d with clouds, darkness & waters

That roll’d perplex’d labring & utter’d

Words articulate, bursting in thunders

That roll’d on the tops of his mountains

4: From the depths of dark solitude, From

The eternal abode in my holiness,

Hidden set apart in my stern counsels

Reserv’d for the days of futurity,

10   I have sought for a joy without pain,

For a solid without fluctuation

Why will you die O Eternals?

Why live in unquenchable burnings?

5 First I fought with the fire; consum’d

Inwards, into a deep world within:

A void immense, wild dark & deep,

Where nothing was; Natures wide womb

And self balanc’d stretch’d o’er the void

I alone, even I\! the winds merciless

20   Bound; but condensing, in torrents

They fall & fall; strong I repell’d

The vast waves, & arose on the waters

A wide world of solid obstruction

6. Here alone I in books formd of metals

Have written the secrets of wisdom

The secrets of dark contemplation

By fightings and conflicts dire,

With terrible monsters Sin-bred:

Which the bosoms of all inhabit;

30   Seven deadly Sins of the soul.

7. Lo\! I unfold my darkness: and on

This rock, place with strong hand the Book

Of eternal brass, written in my solitude.

8. Laws of peace, of love, of unity:

Of pity, compassion, forgiveness.

Let each chuse one habitation:

His ancient infinite mansion:

One command, one joy, one desire,

One curse, one weight, one measure

40   One King, one God, one Law.



CHAP: III

1. The voice ended, they saw his pale visage

Emerge from the darkness; his hand

On the rock of eternity unclasping

The Book of brass. Rage siez’d the strong

2. Rage, fury, intense indignation

In cataracts of fire blood & gall

In whirlwinds of sulphurous smoke:

And enormous forms of energy;

All the seven deadly sins of the soul

PLATE 5

In living creations appear’d

In the flames of eternal fury.

3. Sund’ring, dark’ning, thund’ring\!

Rent away with a terrible crash

Eternity roll’d wide apart

Wide asunder rolling

Mountainous all around

Departing; departing; departing:

Leaving ruinous fragments of life

10   Hanging frowning cliffs & all between

An ocean of voidness unfathomable.

4. The roaring fires ran o’er the heav’ns

In whirlwinds & cataracts of blood

And o’er the dark desarts of Urizen

Fires pour thro’ the void on all sides

On Urizens self-begotten armies.

5. But no light from the fires. all was darkness

In the flames of Eternal fury

6. In fierce anguish & quenchless flames

20   To the desarts and rocks he ran raging

To hide, but he could not: combining

He dug mountains & hills in vast strength,

He piled them in incessant labour,

In howlings & pangs & fierce madness

Long periods in burning fires labouring

Till hoary, and age-broke, and aged,

In despair and the shadows of death.

7. And a roof, vast petrific around,

On all sides he fram’d: like a womb;

30   Where thousands of rivers in veins

Of blood pour down the mountains to cool

The eternal fires beating without

From Eternals; & like a black globe

View’d by sons of Eternity, standing

On the shore of the infinite ocean

Like a human heart strugling & beating

The vast world of Urizen appear’d.

8. And Los round the dark globe of Urizen,

Kept watch for Eternals to confine,

40   The obscure separation alone;

For Eternity stood wide apart,

PLATE 6

As the stars are apart from the earth

9. Los wept howling around the dark Demon:

And cursing his lot; for in anguish,

Urizen was rent from his side;

And a fathomless void for his feet;

And intense fires for his dwelling.

10. But Urizen laid in a stony sleep

Unorganiz’d, rent from Eternity

11. The Eternals said: What is this? Death\[.\]

10  Urizen is a clod of clay.

PLATE 7

12: Los howld in a dismal stupor,

Groaning\! gnashing\! groaning\!

Till the wrenching apart was healed

13: But the wrenching of Urizen heal’d not

Cold, featureless, flesh or clay,

Rifted with direful changes

He lay in a dreamless night

14: Till Los rouz’d his fires, affrighted

At the formless unmeasurable death.



PLATE 8

CHAP: IV\[a\]

1: Los smitten with astonishment

Frightend at the hurtling bones

2: And at the surging sulphureous

Perturbed Immortal mad raging

3: In whirlwinds & pitch & nitre

Round the furious limbs of Los

4: And Los formed nets & gins

And threw the nets round about

5: He watch’d in shuddring fear

10   The dark changes & bound every change

With rivets of iron & brass;

6. And these were the changes of Urizen.



PLATE 10

CHAP: IV\[b\]

1. Ages on ages roll’d over him\!

In stony sleep ages roll’d over him\!

Like a dark waste stretching chang’able

By earthquakes riv’n, belching sullen fires

On ages roll’d ages in ghastly

Sick torment; around him in whirlwinds

Of darkness the eternal Prophet howl’d

Beating still on his rivets of iron

Pouring sodor of iron; dividing

10   The horrible night into watches.

2. And Urizen \(so his eternal name\)

His prolific delight obscurd more & more

In dark secresy hiding in surgeing

Sulphureous fluid his phantasies.

The Eternal Prophet heavd the dark bellows,

And turn’d restless the tongs; and the hammer

Incessant beat; forging chains new & new

Numb’ring with links. hours, days & years

3 The eternal mind bounded began to roll

20   Eddies of wrath ceaseless round & round,

And the sulphureous foam surgeing thick

Settled, a lake, bright, & shining clear:

White as the snow on the mountains cold.

4. Forgetfulness, dumbness, necessity\!

In chains of the mind locked up,

Like fetters of ice shrinking together

Disorganiz’d, rent from Eternity,

Los beat on his fetters of iron;

And heated his furnaces & pour’d

30   Iron sodor and sodor of brass

5. Restless turnd the immortal inchain’d

Heaving dolorous\! anguish’d\! unbearable

Till a roof shaggy wild inclos’d

In an orb, his fountain of thought.

6. In a horrible dreamful slumber;

Like the linked infernal chain;

A vast Spine writh’d in torment

Upon the winds; shooting pain’d

Ribs, like a bending cavern

And bones of solidness, froze

40   Over all his nerves of joy.

And a first Age passed over,

And a state of dismal woe.

PLATE II

7. From the caverns of his jointed Spine,

Down sunk with fright a red

Round globe hot burning deep

Deep down into the Abyss:

Panting: Conglobing, Trembling

Shooting out ten thousand branches

Around his solid bones.

And a second Age passed over,

And a state of dismal woe.

10   8. In harrowing fear rolling round;

His nervous brain shot branches

Round the branches of his heart.

On high into two little orbs

And fixed in two little caves

Hiding carefully from the wind,

His Eyes beheld the deep,

And a third Age passed over:

And a state of dismal woe.

9. The pangs of hope began,

20   In heavy pain striving, struggling.

Two Ears in close volutions.

From beneath his orbs of vision

Shot spiring out and petrified

As they grew. And a fourth Age passed

And a state of dismal woe.

10. In ghastly torment sick;

Hanging upon the wind;

PLATE 13

Two Nostrils bent down to the deep.

And a fifth Age passed over;

And a state of dismal woe.

11. In ghastly torment sick;

Within his ribs bloated round,

A craving Hungry Cavern;

Thence arose his channeld Throat,

And like a red flame a Tongue

Of thirst & of hunger appeard.

10   And a sixth Age passed over:

And a state of dismal woe.

12. Enraged & stifled with torment

He threw his right Arm to the north

His left Arm to the south

Shooting out in anguish deep,

And his Feet stampd the nether Abyss

In trembling & howling & dismay.

And a seventh Age passed over:

And a state of dismal woe.

CHAP: V

20   1. In terrors Los shrunk from his task:

His great hammer fell from his hand:

His fires beheld, and sickening,

Hid their strong limbs in smoke.

For with noises ruinous loud;

With hurtlings & clashings & groans

The Immortal endur’d his chains,

Tho’ bound in a deadly sleep.

2. All the myriads of Eternity:

All the wisdom & joy of life:

30   Roll like a sea around him,

Except what his little orbs

Of sight by degrees unfold.

3. And now his eternal life

Like a dream was obliterated

4. Shudd’ring, the Eternal Prophet smote

With a stroke, from his north to south region

The bellows & hammer are silent now

A nerveless silence, his prophetic voice

Siez’d; a cold solitude & dark void

40   The Eternal Prophet & Urizen clos’d

5. Ages on ages rolld over them

Cut off from life & light frozen

Into horrible forms of deformity

Los suffer’d his fires to decay

Then he look’d back with anxious desire

But the space undivided by existence

Struck horror into his soul.

6. Los wept obscur’d with mourning:

His bosom earthquak’d with sighs;

50   He saw Urizen deadly black,

In his chains bound, & Pity began,

7. In anguish dividing & dividing

For pity divides the soul

In pangs eternity on eternity

Life in cataracts pourd down his cliffs

The void shrunk the lymph into Nerves

Wand’ring wide on the bosom of night

And left a round globe of blood

Trembling upon the Void

PLATE 15

Thus the Eternal Prophet was divided

Before the death-image of Urizen

For in changeable clouds and darkness

In a winterly night beneath,

The Abyss of Los stretch’d immense:

And now seen now obscur’d to the eyes

Of Eternals, the visions remote

Of the dark seperation appear’d.

As glasses discover Worlds

10   In the endless Abyss of space,

So the expanding eyes of Immortals

Beheld the dark visions of Los,

And the globe of life blood trembling.

PLATE 18

8. The globe of life blood trembled

Branching out into roots;

Fibrous, writhing upon the winds;

Fibres of blood, milk and tears;

In pangs, eternity on eternity.

At length in tears & cries imbodied

A female form trembling and pale

Waves before his deathly face

9. All Eternity shudderd at sight

10   Of the first female now separate

Pale as a cloud of snow

Waving before the face of Los

10. Wonder, awe, fear, astonishment,

Petrify the eternal myriads;

At the first female form now separate

PLATE 19

They call’d her Pity, and fled

11. ‘Spread a Tent, with strong curtains around them

‘Let cords & stakes bind in the Void

That Eternals may no more behold them’

12. They began to weave curtains of darkness

They erected large pillars round the Void

With golden hooks fastend in the pillars

With infinite labour the Eternals

A woof wove, and called it Science



CHAP: VI

10   1. But Los saw the Female & pitied

He embrac’d her, she wept, she refus’d

In perverse and cruel delight

She fled from his arms, yet he followd

2. Eternity shudder’d when they saw,

Man begetting his likeness,

On his own divided image.

3. A time passed over, the Eternals

Began to erect a tent;

When Enitharmon, sick,

20   Felt a Worm within her womb.

4. Yet helpless it lay like a Worm

In the trembling womb

To be moulded into existence

5. All day the worm lay on her bosom

All night within her womb

The worm lay till it grew to a serpent

With dolorous hissings & poisons

Round Enitharmons loins folding,

6. Coild within Enitharmons womb

30   The serpent grew casting its scales,

With sharp pangs the hissings began

To change to a grating cry,

Many sorrows and dismal throes

Many forms of fish, bird & beast,

Brought forth an Infant form

Where was a worm before.

7. The Eternals their tent finished

Alarm’d with these gloomy visions

When Enitharmon groaning

40   Produc’d a man Child to the light.

8. A shriek ran thro’ Eternity:

And a paralytic stroke;

At the birth of the Human shadow.

9. Delving earth in his resistless way;

Howling, the Child with fierce flames

Issu’d from Enitharmon.

10. The Eternals, closed the tent:

They beat down the stakes the cords

PLATE 20

Stretch’d for a work of eternity;

No more Los beheld Eternity.

11. In his hands he siez’d the infant

He bathed him in springs of sorrow

He gave him to Enitharmon.



CHAP: VII

1. They named the child Orc, he grew

Fed with milk of Enitharmon

2. Los awoke her; O sorrow & pain\!

A tight’ning girdle grew,

10   Around his bosom. In sobbings

He burst the girdle in twain,

But still another girdle

Oppressd his bosom, In sobbings

Again he burst it. Again

Another girdle succeeds

The girdle was form’d by day;

By night was burst in twain.

3. These falling down on the rock

Into an iron Chain

20   In each other link by link lock’d

4. They took Orc to the top of a mountain.

O how Enitharmon wept\!

They chain’d his young limbs to the rock

With the Chain of Jealousy

Beneath Urizens deathful shadow

5. The dead heard the voice of the child

And began to awake from sleep

All things. heard the voice of the child

And began to awake to life.

30   6. And Urizen craving with hunger

Stung with the odours of Nature

Explor’d his dens around

7. He form’d a line & a plummet

To divide the Abyss beneath.

He form’d a dividing rule:

8. He formed scales to weigh;

He formed massy weights;

He formed a brazen quadrant;

He formed golden compasses

40   And began to explore the Abyss

And he planted a garden of fruits

9. But Los encircled Enitharmon

With fires of Prophecy

From the sight of Urizen & Orc.

10. And she bore an enormous race



CHAP: VIII

1. Urizen explor’d his dens

Mountain, moor, & wilderness,

With a globe of fire lighting his journey

A fearful journey, annoy’d

50   By cruel enormities: forms

PLATE 23

Of life on his forsaken mountains

2. And his world teemd vast enormities

Frightning; faithless; fawning

Portions of life; similitudes

Of a foot, or a hand, or a head

Or a heart, or an eye, they swam mischevous

Dread terrors\! delighting in blood

3. Most Urizen sicken’d to see

His eternal creations appear

10   Sons & daughters of sorrow on mountains

Weeping\! wailing\! first Thiriel appear’d

Astonish’d at his own existence

Like a man from a cloud born, & Utha

From the waters emerging, laments\!

Grodna rent the deep earth howling

Amaz’d\! his heavens immense cracks

Like the ground parch’d with heat; then Fuzon

Flam’d out\! first begotten, last born.

All his eternal sons in like manner

20   His daughters from green herbs & cattle

From monsters, & worms of the pit.

4. He in darkness clos’d, view’d all his race

And his soul sicken’d\! he curs’d

Both sons & daughters; for he saw

That no flesh nor spirit could keep

His iron laws one moment,

5. For he saw that life liv’d upon death

PLATE 25

The Ox in the slaughter house moans

The Dog at the wintry door

And he wept, & he called it Pity

And his tears flowed down on the winds

6. Cold he wander’d on high, over their cities

In weeping & pain & woe\!

And where-ever he wanderd in sorrows

Upon the aged heavens

A cold shadow follow’d behind him

10   Like a spiders web, moist, cold, & dim

Drawing out from his sorrowing soul

The dungeon-like heaven dividing

Where ever the footsteps of Urizen

Walk’d over the cities in sorrow.

7. Till a Web dark & cold, throughout all

The tormented element stretch’d

From the sorrows of Urizens soul

And the Web is a Female in embrio.

None could break the Web, no wings of fire.

20   8. So twisted the cords, & so knotted

The meshes: twisted like to the human brain

9. And all calld it, The Net of Religion.



CHAP: IX

1. Then the Inhabitants of those Cities:

Felt their Nerves change into Marrow

And hardening Bones began

In swift diseases and torments,

In throbbings & shootings & grindings

Thro’ all the coasts; till weaken’d

The Senses inward rush’d shrinking,

30   Beneath the dark net of infection.

2. Till the shrunken eyes clouded over

Discernd not the woven hipocrisy

But the streaky slime in their heavens

Brought together by narrowing perceptions

Appeard transparent air; for their eyes

Grew small like the eyes of a man

And in reptile forms shrinking together

Of seven feet stature they remaind

3. Six days they shrunk up from existence

40   And on the seventh day they rested

And they bless’d the seventh day, in sick hope:

And forgot their eternal life

4. And their thirty cities divided

In form of a human heart

No more could they rise at will

In the infinite void, but bound down

To earth by their narrowing perceptions

PLATE 28

They lived a period of years

Then left a noisom body

To the jaws of devouring darkness

5. And their children wept, & built

Tombs in the desolate places,

And form’d laws of prudence, and call’d them

The eternal laws of God

6. And the thirty cities remaind

Surrounded by salt floods, now call’d

10   Africa: its name was then Egypt.

7. The remaining sons of Urizen

Beheld their brethren shrink together

Beneath the Net of Urizen;

Perswasion was in vain;

For the ears of the inhabitants

Were wither’d, & deafen’d, & cold.

And their eyes could not discern,

Their brethren of other cities.

8. So Fuzon call’d all together

20   The remaining children of Urizen:

And they left the pendulous earth:

They called it Egypt, & left it.

9. And the salt ocean rolled englob’d

        The End of the \[*first*\] book of Urizen



## ********THE BOOK OF AHANIA





PLATE 2

AHANIA

CHAP: Ist

1: Fuzon, on a chariot iron-wing’d

On spiked flames rose; his hot visage

Flam’d furious\! sparkles in his hair & beard

Shot down his wide bosom and shoulders.

On clouds of smoke rages his chariot

And his right hand burns red in its cloud

Moulding into a vast globe, his wrath

As the thunder-stone is moulded.

Son of Urizens silent burnings

10    2: Shall we worship this Demon of smoke,

Said Fuzon, this abstract non-entity

This cloudy God seated on waters

Now seen, now obscur’d, King of sorrow?

3: So he spoke, in a fiery flame,

On Urizen frowning indignant,

The Globe of wrath shaking on high

Roaring with fury, he threw

The howling Globe: burning it flew

Lengthning into a hungry beam. Swiftly

20    4: Oppos’d to the exulting flam’d beam

The broad Disk of Urizen upheav’d

Across the Void many a mile.

5: It was forg’d in mills where the winter

Beats incessant; ten winters the disk

Unremitting endur’d the cold hammer.

6: But the strong arm that sent it, remember’d

The sounding beam; laughing it tore through

That beaten mass: keeping its direction

The cold loins of Urizen dividing.

30    7: Dire shriek’d his invisible Lust

Deep groan’d Urizen\! stretching his awful hand

Ahania \(so name his parted soul\)

He siez’d on his mountains of Jealousy.

He groand anguishd & called her Sin,

Kissing her and weeping over her;

Then hid her in darkness in silence;

Jealous tho’ she was invisible.

8: She fell down a faint shadow wandring

In chaos and circling dark Urizen,

40    As the moon anguishd circles the earth;

Hopeless\! abhorrd\! a death-shadow,

Unseen, unbodied, unknown,

The mother of Pestilence.

9: But the fiery beam of Fuzon

Was a pillar of fire to Egypt

Five hundred years wandring on earth

Till Los siezd it and beat in a mass

With the body of the sun.



PLATE 3

CHAP: IId

1: But the forehead of Urizen gathering,

And his eyes pale with anguish, his lips

Blue & changing; in tears and bitter

Contrition he prepar’d his Bow,

2: Form’d of Ribs: that in his dark solitude

When obscur’d in his forests fell monsters,

Arose. For his dire Contemplations

Rush’d down like floods from his mountains

In torrents of mud settling thick

10    With Eggs of unnatural production

Forthwith hatching; some howl’d on his hills

Some in vales; some aloft flew in air

3: Of these: an enormous dread Serpent

Scaled and poisonous horned

Approach’d Urizen even to his knees

As he sat on his dark rooted Oak.

4: With his horns he push’d furious.

Great the conflict & great the jealousy

In cold poisons: but Urizen smote him

20    5: First he poison’d the rocks with his blood

Then polish’d his ribs, and his sinews

Dried; laid them apart till winter;

Then a Bow black prepar’d: on this Bow,

A poisoned rock plac’d in silence:

He utter’d these words to the Bow:

6: O Bow of the clouds of secresy\!

O nerve of that lust form’d monster\!

Send this rock swift, invisible thro’

The black clouds, on the bosom of Fuzon

30    7: So saying, In torment of his wounds,

He bent the enormous ribs slowly;

A circle of darkness\! then fixed

The sinew in its rest: then the Rock

Poisonous source\! plac’d with art, lifting difficult

Its weighty bulk: silent the rock lay.

8: While Fuzon his tygers unloosing

Thought Urizen slain by his wrath.

I am God. said he, eldest of things\!

9: Sudden sings the rock, swift & invisible

40    On Fuzon flew, enter’d his bosom;

His beautiful visage, his tresses,

That gave light to the mornings of heaven

Were smitten with darkness, deform’d

And outstretch’d on the edge of the forest

10: But the rock fell upon the Earth,

Mount Sinai, in Arabia.



CHAP: III

1: The Globe shook; and Urizen seated

On black clouds his sore wound anointed

The ointment flow’d down on the void

50    Mix’d with blood; here the snake gets her poison

2: With difficulty & great pain; Urizen

Lifted on high the dead corse:

On his shoulders he bore it to where

A Tree hung over the Immensity

3: For when Urizen shrunk away

From Eternals, he sat on a rock

Barren; a rock which himself

From redounding fancies had petrified

Many tears fell on the rock,

60    Many sparks of vegetation;

Soon shot the painted root

Of Mystery, under his heel:

It grew a thick tree; he wrote

In silence his book of iron:

Till the horrid plant bending its boughs

Grew to roots when it felt the earth

And again sprung to many a tree.

4: Amaz’d started Urizen\! when

He beheld himself compassed round

70    And high roofed over with trees

He arose but the stems stood so thick

He with difficulty and great pain

Brought his Books, all but the Book

PLATE 4

Of iron, from the dismal shade

5: The Tree still grows over the Void

Enrooting itself all around

An endless labyrinth of woe\!

6: The corse of his first begotten

On the accursed Tree of MYSTERY:

On the topmost stem of this Tree

Urizen nail’d Fuzon’s corse.

CHAP: IV

1: Forth flew the arrows of pestilence

10   Round the pale living Corse on the tree

2: For in Urizens slumbers of abstraction

In the infinite ages of Eternity:

When his Nerves of Joy melted & flow’d

A white Lake on the dark blue air

In perturb’d pain and dismal torment

Now stretching out, now swift conglobing.

3: Effluvia vapor’d above

In noxious clouds; these hover’d thick

Over the disorganiz’d Immortal,

20   Till petrific pain scurfd o’er the Lakes

As the bones of man, solid & dark

4: The clouds of disease hover’d wide

Around the Immortal in torment

Perching around the hurtling bones

Disease on disease, shape on shape,

Winged screaming in blood & torment.

5: The Eternal Prophet beat on his anvils

Enrag’d in the desolate darkness

He forg’d nets of iron around

30    And Los threw them around the bones

6: The shapes screaming flutter’d vain

Some combin’d into muscles & glands

Some organs for craving and lust

Most remain’d on the tormented void:

Urizens army of horrors.

7: Round the pale living Corse on the Tree

Forty years flew the arrows of pestilence

8: Wailing and terror and woe

Ran thro’ all his dismal world:

Forty years all his sons & daughters

Felt their skulls harden; then Asia

Arose in the pendulous deep.

9: They reptilize upon the Earth.

10: Fuzon groand on the Tree.

CHAP: V

1: The lamenting voice of Ahania

Weeping upon the void.

And round the Tree of Fuzon:

Distant in solitary night

Her voice was heard, but no form

50    Had she: but her tears from clouds

Eternal fell round the Tree

2: And the voice cried: Ah Urizen\! Love\!

Flower of morning\! I weep on the verge

Of Non-entity; how wide the Abyss

Between Ahania and thee\!

3: I lie on the verge of the deep.

I see thy dark clouds ascend,

I see thy black forests and floods,

A horrible waste to my eyes\!

60    4: Weeping I walk over rocks

Over dens & thro’ valleys of death

Why didst thou despise Ahania

To cast me from thy bright presence

Into the World of Loneness

5: I cannot touch his hand:

Nor weep on his knees, nor hear

His voice & bow, nor see his eyes

And joy, nor hear his footsteps, and

My heart leap at the lovely sound\!

70    I cannot kiss the place

Whereon his bright feet have trod,

PLATE 5

But I wander on the rocks

With hard necessity.

6: Where is my golden palace

Where my ivory bed

Where the joy of my morning hour

Where the sons of eternity, singing

7: To awake bright Urizen, my king\!

To arise to the mountain sport,

To the bliss of eternal valleys:

10    8: To awake my king in the morn\!

To embrace Ahanias joy

On the bredth of his open bosom:

From my soft cloud of dew to fall

In showers of life on his harvests.

9: When he gave my happy soul

To the sons of eternal joy:

When he took the daughters of life.

Into my chambers of love:

10: When I found babes of bliss on my beds.

20    And bosoms of milk in my chambers

Fill’d with eternal seed

O\! eternal births sung round Ahania,

In interchange sweet of their joys.

11: Swell’d with ripeness & fat with fatness

Bursting on winds my odors,

My ripe figs and rich pomegranates

In infant joy at thy feet

O Urizen, sported and sang;

12: Then thou with thy lap full of seed

30    With thy hand full of generous fire

Walked forth from the clouds of morning

On the virgins of springing joy,

On the human soul to cast

The seed of eternal science.

13: The sweat poured down thy temples

To Ahania return’d in evening

The moisture awoke to birth

My mothers-joys, sleeping in bliss.

14: But now alone over rocks, mountains

40  Cast out from thy lovely bosom:

Cruel jealousy\! selfish fear\!

Self-destroying: how can delight,

Renew in these chains of darkness

Where bones of beasts are strown

On the bleak and snowy mountains

Where bones from the birth are buried

Before they see the light.

## **********THE BOOK OF LOS**

PLATE 3

LOS

CHAP: I

1: Eno aged Mother,

Who the chariot of Leutha guides,

Since the day of thunders in old time

2: Sitting beneath the eternal Oak

Trembled and shook the stedfast Earth

And thus her speech broke forth.

3: O Times remote\!

When Love & Joy were adoration:

And none impure were deem’d.

10   Not Eyeless Covet

Nor Thin-lip’d Envy

Nor Bristled Wrath

Nor Curled Wantonness

4: But Covet was poured full:

Envy fed with fat of lambs:

Wrath with lions gore:

Wantonness lulld to sleep

With the virgins lute,

Or sated with her love.

20   5: Till Covet broke his locks & bars,

And slept with open doors:

Envy sung at the rich mans feast:

Wrath was follow’d up and down

By a little ewe lamb

And Wantonness on his own true love

Begot a giant race:

6: Raging furious the flames of desire

Ran thro’ heaven & earth, living flames

Intelligent, organiz’d: arm’d

30   With destruction & plagues. In the midst

The Eternal Prophet bound in a chain

Compell’d to watch Urizens shadow

7: Rag’d with curses & sparkles of fury

Round the flames roll as Los hurls his chains

Mounting up from his fury, condens’d

Rolling round & round, mounting on high

Into vacuum: into non-entity.

Where nothing was\! dash’d wide apart

His feet stamp the eternal fierce-raging

40   Rivers of wide flame; they roll round

And round on all sides making their way

Into darkness and shadowy obscurity

8: Wide apart stood the fires: Los remain’d

In the void between fire and fire

In trembling and horror they beheld him

They stood wide apart, driv’n by his hands

And his feet which the nether abyss

Stamp’d in fury and hot indignation

9: But no light from the fires all was

PLATE 4

Darkness round Los: heat was not; for bound up

Into fiery spheres from his fury

The gigantic flames trembled and hid

10: Coldness, darkness, obstruction, a Solid

Without fluctuation, hard as adamant

Black as marble of Egypt; impenetrable

Bound in the fierce raging Immortal.

And the seperated fires froze in

A vast solid without fluctuation,

10   Bound in his expanding clear senses

CHAP: II

1: The Immortal stood frozen amidst

The vast rock of eternity; times

And times; a night of vast durance:

Impatient, stifled, stiffend, hardned.

2: Till impatience no longer could bear

The hard bondage, rent: rent, the vast solid

With a crash from immense to immense

3: Crack’d across into numberless fragments

The Prophetic wrath, strug’ling for vent

20   Hurls apart, stamping furious to dust

And crumbling with bursting sobs; heaves

The black marble on high into fragments

4: Hurl’d apart on all sides, as a falling

Rock: the innumerable fragments away

Fell asunder; and horrible vacuum

Beneath him & on all sides round.

5: Falling, falling\! Los fell & fell

Sunk precipitant heavy down down

Times on times, night on night, day on day

30   Truth has bounds. Error none: falling, falling:

Years on years, and ages on ages

Still he fell thro’ the void, still a void

Found for falling day & night without end.

For tho’ day or night was not; their spaces

Were measurd by his incessant whirls

In the horrid vacuity bottomless.

6: The Immortal revolving; indignant

First in wrath threw his limbs, like the babe

New born into our world: wrath subsided

40   And contemplative thoughts first aros

Then aloft his head rear’d in the Abyss

And his downward-borne fall chang’d oblique

7: Many ages of groans: till there grew

Branchy forms: organizing the Human

Into finite inflexible organs.

8: Till in process from falling he bore

Sidelong on the purple air, wafting

The weak breeze in efforts oerwearied

9: Incessant the falling Mind labour’d

50   Organizing itself: till the Vacuum

Became element, pliant to rise,

Or to fall, or to swim, or to fly:

With ease searching the dire vacuity

CHAP: III

1: The Lungs heave incessant, dull and heavy

For as yet were all other parts formless

Shiv’ring: clinging around like a cloud

Dim & glutinous as the white Polypus

Driv’n by waves & englob’d on the tide.

2: And the unformed part crav’d repose

60   Sleep began: the Lungs heave on the wave

Weary overweigh’d, sinking beneath

In a stifling black fluid he woke

3: He arose on the waters, but soon

Heavy falling his organs like roots

Shooting out from the seed, shot beneath,

And a vast world of waters around him

In furious torrents began.

4: Then he sunk, & around his spent Lungs

Began intricate pipes that drew in

70   The spawn of the waters. Outbranching

PLATE 5

An immense Fibrous form, stretching out

Thro’ the bottoms of immensity raging.

5: He rose on the floods: then he smote

The wild deep with his terrible wrath,

Seperating the heavy and thin.

6: Down the heavy sunk; cleaving around

To the fragments of solid: up rose

The thin, flowing round the fierce fires

That glow’d furious in the expanse.

CHAP: IV

10   1: Then Light first began; from the fires

Beams, conducted by fluid so pure

Flow’d around the Immense: Los beheld

Forthwith, writhing upon the dark void

The Back bone of Urizen appear

Hurtling upon the wind

Like a serpent\! like an iron chain

Whirling about in the Deep.

2: Upfolding his Fibres together

To a Form of impregnable strength

20   Los astonish’d and terrified, built

Furnaces; he formed an Anvil

A Hammer of adamant then began

The binding of Urizen day and night

3: Circling round the dark Demon, with howlings

Dismay & sharp blightings; the Prophet

Of Eternity beat on his iron links.

4: And first from those infinite fires

The light that flow’d down on the winds

He siez’d; beating incessant, condensing

30   The subtil particles in an Orb.

5: Roaring indignant the bright sparks

Endur’d the vast Hammer; but unwearied

Los beat on the Anvil; till glorious

An immense Orb of fire he fram’d

6: Oft he quench’d it beneath in the Deeps

Then survey’d the all-bright mass. Again

Siezing fires from the terrific Orbs

He heated the round Globe, then beat

While roaring his Furnaces endur’d

40   The chaind Orb in their infinite wombs

7: Nine ages completed their circles

When Los heated the glowing mass, casting

It down into the Deeps: the Deeps fled

Away in redounding smoke; the Sun

Stood self-balanc’d. And Los smild with joy.

He the vast Spine of Urizen siez’d

And bound down to the glowing illusion

8: But no light, for the Deep fled away

On all sides, and left an unform’d

Dark vacuity: here Urizen lay

50   In fierce torments on his glowing bed

9: Till his Brain in a rock, & his Heart

In a fleshy slough formed four rivers

Obscuring the immense Orb of fire

Flowing down into night: till a Form

Was completed, a Human Illusion

In darkness and deep clouds involvd.

Enion said – \[*His*\] Thy fear has made me tremble thy

    terrors have surrounded me

20  All Love is lost Terror succeeds & Hatred instead of Love

And stern demands of Right & Duty instead of Liberty

Once thou wast to Me the loveliest son of heaven – But now

Why art thou Terrible and yet I love thee in thy terror till

I am almost Extinct & soon shall be a shadow in Oblivion

Unless some way can be found that I may look upon thee & live

Hide me some shadowy semblance. secret whispring in my Ear

In secret of Soft Wings. in mazes of delusive beauty

I have lookd into the secret soul of him I lovd,

And in the Dark recesses found Sin & cannot return

30  Trembling & pale sat Tharmas weeping in his clouds

Why wilt thou Examine every little fibre of my soul

Spreading them out before the Sun like Stalks of flax to dry

The infant joy is beautiful but its anatomy

Horrible Ghast & Deadly nought shalt thou find in it

But Death Despair & Everlasting brooding Melancholy

Thou wilt go mad with horror if thou dost Examine thus

Every moment of my secret hours Yea I know

That I have sinnd & that my Emanations are become harlots

I am already distracted at their deeds & if I look

40  Upon them more Despair will bring self murder on my soul

O Enion thou art thyself a root growing in hell

Tho thus heavenly beautiful to draw me to destruction

Sometimes I think thou art a flower expanding

Sometimes I think thou art fruit breaking from its bud

In dreadful dolor & pain & I am like an atom

A Nothing left in darkness yet I am an identity

I wish & feel & weep & groan Ah terrible terrible

In \[*Beulah*\] Eden Females sleep the winter in soft silken veils

Woven by their own hands to hide them in the darksom grave

But Males immortal live renewd by female deaths. in soft

Delight they die & they revive in spring with music & songs

Enion said Farewell I die I hide from thy searching eyes

So saying – From her bosom weaving soft in Sinewy threads

A tabernacle \[*of delight/for Enitharmon*\] for Jerusalem

     She sat among the Rocks

Singing her lamentation. Tharmas groand among his Clouds

Weeping, \[*and*\] then bending from his Clouds he stoopd

     his innocent head

10  And stretching out his holy hand in the vast Deep sublime

Turnd round the circle of Destiny with tears & bitter sighs

And said. Return O Wanderer when the Day of Clouds is oer

So saying he sunk down into the sea a pale white corse

\[*So saying*\] In torment he sunk down & flowd among her filmy Woof

His Spectre issuing from his feet in flames of fire

In \[*dismal*\] gnawing pain drawn out by her lovd fingers every nerve

She counted. every vein & lacteal threading them among

Her woof of terror. Terrified & drinking tears of woe

Shuddring she wove. – nine days & night Sleepless her food was tears

20  Wondring she saw her woof begin to animate. & not

As Garments woven subservient to her hands but having a will

Of its own perverse & wayward Enion Lovd & wept

Nine days she labourd at her work & nine dark sleepless nights

But on the tenth \[*?dread*\] trembling morn the Circle of Destiny Complete

Round rolld the Sea Englobing in a watry Globe self balancd

A Frowning Continent appeard Where Enion in the desart

Terrified in her own Creation viewing her woven shadow

Sat in a \[*sweet*\] dread intoxication of \[*false woven bliss/*

     *soft woven sorrow*\] Repentance & Contrition

There is from Great Eternity a mild & pleasant rest

30  Namd Beulah a Soft Moony Universe feminine lovely

Pure mild & Gentle given in Mercy to those who sleep

Eternally. Created by the Lamb of God around

On all sides within & without the Universal Man

The Daughters of Beaulah follow sleepers in all their

     \[*wanderings*\] Dreams

Creating Spaces lest they fall into Eternal Death

The Circle of Destiny complete they gave to it a Space

And namd the Space Ulro & brooded over it in care & love

They said The Spectre is in every man insane & most

Deformd Thro the three heavens descending in fury & fire

40  We meet it with our Songs & loving blandishments & give

To it a form of vegetation But this Spectre of Tharmas

Is Eternal Death What shall we do O God \[*help*\] pity & help

So spoke they & closd the Gate of \[*Auricular power/*

     *nerves*\] the Tongue in trembling fear

\[*He spurnd Enion with his foot he sprang aloft in Clouds*

*Alighting in his drunken joy in a far distant Grove*\]

\[*What have I done said Enion accursed wretch\! What deed.*

*Is this a deed of Love I know what I have done. I know*

*Too late now to repent. Love is changd to deadly Hate,*

*A life is blotted out & I alone remain possessd with Fears*

50  *I see the \(remembrance\) shadow of the dead within my \(eyes\)*

     *soul wandering*

*In darkness & solitude forming Seas of \(Trouble\) Doubt &*

     *rocks of \(sorrow\) Repentance*

*Already are my Eyes reverted. all that I behold*

*Within my soul has lost its splendor & a brooding Fear*

*Shadows me oer & drives me outward to a world of woe*

*So waild she trembling before her own Created Phantasm*\]

\[*But standing on the Rocks her woven shadow glowing bright*\]

Who animating times on times by the force of her sweet song

PAGE 6

She drew the Spectre forth from Tharmas in \[*her silken*\] her shining loom

Of vegetation weeping in wayward infancy & sullen youth

Listning to her soft lamentations soon his tongue began

To Lisp out words & soon in masculine strength augmenting he

Reard up a form of gold & stood upon the glittering rock

A shadowy human form winged & in his depths

The dazzlings as of gems shone clear, rapturous in \[*joy*\] fury

Glorying in his own eyes Exalted in terrific Pride

\[*Searching for glory wishing that the heavens had eyes to See*

10   *And courting that the Earth would ope her Eyelids & behold*

*Such wondrous beauty repining in the midst of all his glory*

*That nought but Enion could be found to praise adore & love*

*Three days in self admiring raptures on the rocks he flamd*

*And three dark nights repind the solitude. but the third morn*

*Astonishd he found Enion hidden in the darksome Cave*

*She spoke What am I wherefore was I put forth on these rocks*

*Among the Clouds to tremble in the wind in solitude*

*Where is the voice that lately woke the desart Where the Face*

*That wept among the clouds & where the voice that shall reply*

20   *No other living thing is here. The Sea the Earth. the Heaven*

*And Enion desolate where art thou Tharmas O return*

*Three days she waild & three dark nights sitting among the Rocks*

*While the bright spectre hid himself among the ?trailing clouds*

*Then sleep fell on her eyelids in a Chasm of the Valley*

*The Sixteenth morn the Spectre stood before her manifest*\]

\[*The Spectre thus spoke. \(Art thou not my slave & shalt thou dare*

*To smite me with thy tongue beware lest I sting also thee\)*

     *Who art thou Diminutive husk & shell*

*Broke from my bonds I scorn my prison I scorn & yet I love*

30   *If thou hast sinnd & art polluted know that I am pure*

*And unpolluted & will bring to rigid strict account*

*All thy past deeds hear what I tell thee\! mark it well\! remember\!*

*This world is \(Mine\) Thine in which thou dwellest that within thy soul*

*That dark & dismal infinite where Thought roams up & down*

Is \(thine\) Mine & there thou goest when with one Sting of my tongue

*Envenomed thou rollst inward to the place \(of death & hell\) whence I emergd*

*She trembling answerd Wherefore was I born & what am I*

*A sorrow & a fear a living torment & naked Victim*

*I thought to weave a Covering \(from\) for my Sins from wrath of Tharmas*\]

PAGE 7

\[*Examining the sins of Tharmas I \(have\) soon found my own*

*O slay me not thou art his Wrath embodied in Deceit*\]

\[*I thought Tharmas a Sinner* & *murderd his Emanations*

*His secret loves* & *Graces Ah me wretched What have I done*

*\(But\) For now I find that all those Emanations were my Childrens Souls*

*And I have murderd them with Cruelty above atonement*

*Those that remain have fled from my cruelty into the desarts*

*\(Among wild beasts to roam\) And thou the delusive*

     *tempter to these deeds sittest before me*

*\(But where is/Thou art not\) And art thou Tharmas all thy*

     *soft delusive beauty cannot*

10   *Tempt me to murder \(honest love\) my own soul & wipe my tears & smile*

*In this thy world \(for ah\! how\) not mine\! tho dark I feel my world within*

*The Spectre said Thou sinful Woman. was it thy Desire*

*That I should hide thee with my power & delight thee with my beauty*

*And now thou darknest in my presence, never from my sight*

*Shalt thou depart to weep in secret. In my jealous wings*

*I evermore will hold thee when thou goest out or comest in*

*Tis thou has darkend all My World O Woman lovely bane*\]

\[*Thus they contended all the day among the Caves of Tharmas*

*Twisting in fearful forms & howling, howling harsh shrieking*

20  *Howling harsh shrieking, mingling their bodies join in burning anguish*\]

Opening his rifted rocks mingling together they join in burning anguish

Mingling his \[*horrible/terrible*\] horrible \[*brightness*\] darkness with her tender limbs then high she soard

Shrieking above the ocean: a bright wonder that \[*Beulah*\] nature shudderd at

Half Woman & half \[*Spectre/ Serpent*\] desart all his \[*lovely changing*\] darkly waving colours mix

With her fair crystal clearness in her lips & cheeks his \[*poisons*\] metals rose

In blushes like the morning & his \[*scaly armour*\] rocky features softning

A \[*monster*\] wonder lovely in the heavens or wandring on the earth

With \[*Spectre*\] female voice \[*incessant wailing in incessant*

     *thirst*\] warbling upon the hollow vales

Beauty all blushing with desire \[*mocking her fell despair*\] a self enjoying wonder

30  \[*Wandering desolate, a wonder abhorr’d by Gods & men*\]

For Enion brooded groaning loud the rough seas vegetate.

Golden rocks rise from the \[*vortex*\] vast

And thus her voice. Glory, delight: & sweet enjoyment born

To mild Eternity shut in a threefold shape delightful

To wander in sweet solitude enrapturd at every wind

PAGE 8

Till with fierce pain she brought forth on the rocks her sorrow & woe

Behold two little Infants wept upon the desolate wind.

The first state weeping they began & helpless as a wave

Beaten along its sightless way growing enormous in its motion to

Its utmost goal, till strength from Enion like richest summer shining

Raisd the \[*bright/fierce*\] bright boy & girl with glories

     from their heads out beaming

Drawing forth drooping mothers pity drooping mothers sorrow

\[*But those in Great Eternity Met in the Council of God*

*As One Man hovering over Gilead & Hermon*

10  *He is the Good Shepherd He is the Lord & Master*

*To Create Man Morning by Morning to Give gifts at Noon day*\]

\[*Enion brooded, oer the rocks, the rough rocks groaning vegetate*

*Such power was given to the Solitary wanderer.*

*The barked Oak, the long limbd Beech; the Ches’nut tree; the Pine.*

*The Pear tree mild, the frowning Walnut, the sharp Crab, & Apple sweet,*

*The rough bark opens; twittering peep forth little beaks & wings*

*The Nightingale, the Goldfinch, Robin, Lark, Linnet & Thrush*

*The Goat leap’d from the craggy cliff the Sheep awoke from the mould*

*Upon its green stalk rose the Corn, waving innumerable*

20  *Infolding the bright Infants from the desolating winds*\]

They sulk upon her breast her hair became like snow on mountains

Weaker & weaker, weeping woful, wearier and wearier

Faded & her bright Eyes decayd melted with pity & love

PAGE 9

And then they wander’d far away she sought for them in vain

In weeping blindness stumbling she followd them oer rocks & mountains

Rehumanizing from the Spectre in pangs of maternal love

Ingrate they wanderd scorning her drawing her \[*life;*

     *ingrate*\] Spectrous Life

Repelling her away & away by a dread repulsive power

Into Non Entity revolving round in dark despair.

And drawing in the Spectrous life in pride and haughty joy

Thus Enion gave them all her spectrous life \[*in deep despair*\]

Then \[*Ona*\] Eno a daughter of Beulah took a Moment of Time

10  And drew in out to \[*twenty years*\] Seven thousand years

     with much care & affliction

And many tears & in the \[*twenty*\] Every year \[*gave*

     *visions toward heaven*\] made windows into Eden

She also took an atom of space & opend its center

Into Infinitude & ornamented it with wondrous art

Astonishd sat her Sisters of Beulah to see her soft affections

To Enion & her children & they ponderd these things wondring

And they Alternate kept watch over the Youthful terrors

They saw not yet the Hand Divine for it was not yet reveald

But they went on in Silent Hope & Feminine repose

But Los & Enitharmon delighted in the Moony spaces of \[*Ona*\] Eno

20  Nine Times they livd among the forests, feeding on sweet fruits

And nine bright Spaces wanderd weaving mazes of delight

Snaring the wild Goats for their milk they eat the flesh of Lambs

A male & female naked & ruddy as the pride of summer

Alternate Love & Hate his breast; hers Scorn & Jealousy

In embryon passions. they kiss’d not nor embrac’d for shame & fear

His head beamd light & in his vigorous voice was prophecy

He could controll the times & seasons, & the days & years

She could controll the spaces, regions, desart, flood & forest

But had no power to weave a Veil of covering for her Sins

30  She drave the Females all away from Los

And Los drave all the Males from her away

They wanderd long, till they sat down upon the margind sea.

Conversing with the visions of Beulah in dark slumberous bliss

\[*NIGHT THE SECOND*\]

\[*Nine years they view the ?gleaming spheres ?reading the Visions of Beulah*\]

But the two youthful wonders wanderd in the world of Tharmas

Thy name is Enitharmon; said the \[*bright*\] fierce prophetic boy

While thy mild voice fills all these Caverns with sweet harmony

O how \[*thy*\] our Parents sit & \[*weep*\] mourn in their silent secret bowers

PAGE 10

But Enitharmon answerd with a dropping tear & \[*?smiling*\] frowning

\[*Bright*\] Dark as a dewy morning when the crimson light appears

To make us happy \[*how they*\] let them weary their immortal powers

While we draw in their sweet delights while we return them scorn

On scorn to feed our discontent; for if we grateful prove

They will withhold sweet love, whose food is thorns & bitter roots.

We hear the warlike clarions we view the turning spheres

Yet Thou in indolence reposest holding me in bonds

Heart\! will sing a Song of Death\! it is a Song of Vala\!

10  The Fallen Man takes his repose: Urizen sleeps in the porch

Luvah and Vala \[*wake & fly*\] woke & flew up from the Human Heart

Into the Brain; from thence upon the pillow Vala slumber’d.

And Luvah siez’d the Horses of Light, & rose into the Chariot of Day

Sweet laughter siezd me in my sleep\! silent & close I laughd

For in the visions of Vala I walkd with the mighty Fallen One

I heard his voice among the branches, & among sweet flowers.

Why is the light of Enitharmon darken’d in \[*her*\] dewy morn

Why is the silence of Enitharmon a \[*cloud*\] terror & her

     smile a whirlwind

Uttering this darkness in my halls, in the pillars of my Holy-ones

20  Why dost thou weep as Vala? & wet thy veil with dewy tears,

In slumbers of my night-repose, infusing a false morning?

Driving the Female Emanations all away from Los

I have refused to look upon the Universal Vision

And wilt thou slay with death him who devotes himself to thee

\[*If thou drivest all the \(Males\) Females away from \(Vala\)*

     *Luvah I will drive all*

*The Males away from thee*\]

Once born for the sport & amusement of Man now born

     to drink up all his Powers

PAGE II

I heard the sounding sea; I heard the voice weaker and weaker;

The voice came & went like a dream, I awoke in my sweet bliss.

Then Los smote her upon the Earth twas long eer she revivd

\[*Los*\] He answer’d, darkning \[*with foul*\] more with

     indignation hid in smiles

I die not Enitharmon tho thou singst thy Song of Death

Nor shalt thou me torment For I behold the \[*Eternal*\] Fallen Man

Seeking to comfort Vala, she will not be comforted

She rises from his throne and seeks the shadows of her garden

Weeping for Luvah lost, in the bloody beams of your false morning

10  Sickning lies the \[*Eternal*\] Fallen Man his head sick his heart faint

Mighty atchievement of your power\! Beware the

punishment

\[*Refusing to behold the Divine image which all behold*

*And live thereby, he is sunk down into a deadly sleep*

*But we immortal in our own strength survive by stern debate*

*Till we have drawn the Lamb of God into a mortal form*

*And that he must be born is certain for One must be All*

*And comprehend within himself all things both small & great*

*We therefore for whose sake all things aspire to be & live*

*Will so recieve the Divine Image that amongst the Reprobate*

20   *He may be devoted to Destruction from his mothers womb\]*

I see, invisible descend into the Gardens of Vala

Luvah walking on the winds, I see the invisible knife

I see the shower of blood: I see the swords & spears of futurity

Tho in the Brain of Man we live, & in his circling Nerves.

Tho’ this bright world of all our joy is in the Human Brain.

Where Urizen & all his Hosts hang their immortal lamps

Thou neer shalt leave this cold expanse where watry Tharmas mourns

So spoke Los. Scorn & Indignation rose upon Enitharmon

Then Enitharmon reddning fierce stretchd her immortal hands

30   Descend O Urizen descend with horse & chariots

Threaten not me O visionary thine the punishment

The Human Nature shall no more remain nor Human acts

Form the \[*free*\] rebellious Spirits of Heaven. but War &

     Princedom & Victory & Blood

PAGE 12

Night darkend as she spoke\! a shuddring ran from East to West

A Groan was heard on high. The warlike clarions ceast. the Spirits

Of Luvah & Vala shudderd in their Orb: an orb of blood\!

Eternity groand & was troubled at the Image of Eternal Death

The Wandering Man bow’d his faint head and Urizen descended

And the one must have murderd the other if he had not descended

Indignant muttering low thunders; Urizen descended

Gloomy sounding, Now I am God from Eternity to Eternity

Sullen sat Los plotting Revenge. Silent he \[*Urizen*\] eye’d the Prince

10   Of Light. Silent the prince of Light viewd Los. at length a brooded

Smile broke from Urizen for Enitharmon brightend more & more

Sullen he lowerd on Enitharmon but he smild on Los

Saying Thou art the Lord of Luvah into thine hands I give

The prince of Love the murderer his soul is in thine hands

Pity not Vala for she pitied not the Eternal Man

Nor pity thou the cries of Luvah. Lo these starry hosts

They are thy servants if thou wilt obey my awful Law

Los answered furious art thou one of those who when

     most complacent

Mean mischief most. If you are such Lo\! I am also such

20  One must be master. try thy Arts I also will try mine

For I percieve Thou hast Abundance which I claim as mine

Urizen startled stood but not Long soon he cried

Obey my voice young Demon I am God from Eternity to Eternity

Thus Urizen spoke collected in himself in awful pride

Art thou a visionary of Jesus the soft delusion of Eternity

Lo I am God the terrible destroyer & not the Saviour

Why should the Divine Vision compell the sons of Eden

to forego each his own delight to war against his Spectre

The Spectre is the Man the rest is only delusion & fancy

30  So spoke the Prince of Light & sat beside the Seat of Los

Upon the sandy shore rested his chariot of fire

Ten thousand thousand were his hosts of spirits on the wind:

Ten thousand thousand glittering Chariots shining in the sky:

They pour upon the golden shore beside the silent ocean.

Rejoicing in the Victory & the heavens were filld with blood

The Earth spread forth her table wide. the Night a silver cup

Fill’d with the wine of anguish waited at the golden feast

But the bright Sun was not as yet; he filling all the expanse

Slept as a bird in the blue shell that soon shall burst away

40  Los saw the wound of his blow he saw he pitied he wept

Los now repented that he had smitten Enitharmon he felt love

Arise in all his Veins he threw his arms around her loins

To heal the wound of his smiting

They eat the fleshly bread, they drank the nervous wine

PAGE 13

They listend to the Elemental Harps & Sphery Song

They view’d the dancing Hours, quick sporting thro’ the sky

With winged radiance scattering joys thro the ever changing light

But Luvah & Vala standing in the bloody sky

On high remaind alone forsaken in fierce jealousy

They stood above the heavens forsaken desolate suspended in blood

Descend they could not. nor from Each other avert their eyes

Eternity appeard above them as One Man infolded

In Luvah\[s\] robes of blood & bearing all his afflictions

10  As the sun shines down on the misty earth Such was the Vision

But purple night and crimson morning & golden day descending

Thro’ the clear changing atmosphere display’d green fields among

The varying clouds, like paradises stretch’d in the expanse

With towns & villages and temples, tents sheep-folds and pastures

Where dwell the children of the elemental worlds in harmony.

Not long in harmony they dwell, their life is drawn away

And wintry woes succeed; successive driven into the Void

Where Enion craves: successive drawn into the golden feast

And Los & Enitharmon sat in discontent & scorn

20  The Nuptial Song arose from all the thousand thousand spirits

Over the joyful Earth & Sea, and ascended into the Heavens

For Elemental Gods their thunderous Organs blew; creating

Delicious Viands. Demons of Waves their watry Eccho’s woke\!

\[? *Elements*\] Bright Souls of vegetative life, budding and blossoming

PAGE 14

Stretch their immortal hands to smite the gold & silver Wires

And with immortal Voice soft warbling fill all Earth & Heaven.

With doubling Voices & loud Horns wound round sounding

Cavernous dwellers fill’d the enormous Revelry, Responsing\!

And Spirits of Flaming fire on high, govern’d the mighty Song.

And This the Song\! sung at The Feast of Los & Enitharmon

\[*The Mountain*\] Ephraim calld out to \[*The Mountain*\]

     Zion: Awake O Brother Mountain

Let us refuse the Plow & Spade, the heavy Roller & spiked

Harrow, burn all these Corn fields, throw down all these fences

10  Fattend on Human blood & drunk with wine of life is better far

Than all these labours of the harvest & the vintage. See the river

Red with the blood of Men. swells lustful round my rocky knees

My clouds are not the clouds of verdant fields & groves of fruit

But Clouds of Human Souls, my nostrils drink the lives of Men

The Villages Lament, they faint outstretchd upon the plain

Wailing runs round the Valleys from the Mill & from the Barn

But most the polishd Palaces \[?*weak*\] dark silent bow with dread

Hiding their books & pictures, underneath the dens of Earth

The Cities send to one another saying My sons are Mad

20  With wine of cruelty. Let us plat a scourge O Sister City

Children are nourishd for the Slaughter; once the Child was fed

With Milk; but wherefore now are Children fed with blood

PAGE 15

The Horse is of more value than the Man. The Tyger fierce

Laughs at the Human form, the Lion mocks & thirsts for blood

They cry O Spider spread thy web\! Enlarge thy bones & fill’d

With marrow, sinews & flesh Exalt thyself attain a voice

Call to thy dark armd hosts, for all the sons of Men muster together

To desolate their cities\! Man shall be no more\! Awake O Hosts

The bow string sang upon the hills\! Luvah & Vala ride

Triumphant in the bloody sky. & the Human form is no more

The listning Stars heard, & the first beam of the morning started back

10  He cried out to his Father, depart\! depart\! but sudden Siez’d,

And clad in steel. & his Horse proudly neighd; he smelt the battle

Afar off, Rushing back, reddning with rage the \[*Eternal*\] Mighty Father

Siezd his bright Sheephook studded with gems & gold, he Swung it round

His head shrill sounding in the sky, down rushd the Sun with noise

Of war. The Mountains fled away they sought a place beneath

Vala remaind in desarts of dark solitude, nor Sun nor Moon

By night nor day to comfort her, she labourd in thick smoke

Tharmas endurd not, he fled howling, then a barren waste sunk down

Conglobing in the dark confusion, Mean time Los was born

20  And Thou O Enitharmon\! Hark I hear the hammers of Los

PAGE 16

They melt the bones of Vala, & the bones of Luvah into wedges

The innumerable sons & daughters of Luvah closd in furnaces

Melt into furrows, winter blows his bellows: Ice & Snow

Tend the dire anvils. Mountains mourn & Rivers faint & fail

There is no City nor Corn-field nor Orchard\! all is Rock & Sand

There is no Sun nor Moon nor Star, but rugged wintry rocks

Justling together in the void suspended by inward fires

Impatience now no longer can endure. Distracted Luvah

Bursting forth from the loins of Enitharmon, Thou fierce Terror

10  Go howl in vain, Smite Smite his fetters Smite O wintry hammers

Smite Spectre of Urthona, mock the fiend who drew us down

From heavens of joy into this Deep. Now rage but rage in vain

Thus Sang the Demons of the Deep. the Clarions of War blew loud

The Feast redounds & Crownd with roses & the circling vine

The Enormous Bride & Bridegroom sat, beside them Urizen

With faded radiance sighd, forgetful of the flowing wine

And of Ahania his Pure Bride but She was distant far

But Los & Enitharmon sat in discontent & scorn

Craving the more the more enjoying, drawing out sweet bliss

20  From all the turning wheels of heaven & the chariots of the Slain

At distance Far in Night repelld. in direful hunger craving

Summers & Winters round revolving in the frightful deep.

PAGE 17

\[*And*\] Enion blind & age-bent wept upon the desolate wind

Why does the Raven cry aloud and no eye pities her?

Why fall the Sparrow & the Robin in the foodless winter?

Faint\! shivering they sit on leafless bush, or frozen stone

Wearied with seeking food across the snowy waste; the little

Heart, cold; and the little tongue consum’d, that once in thoughtless joy

Gave songs of gratitude to \[*the*\] waving corn fields round their nest.

Why howl the Lion & the Wolf? why do they roam abroad?

Deluded by \[*the*\] summers heat they sport in enormous love

And cast their young out to the hungry wilds & sandy desarts

PAGE l8

Why is the Sheep given to the knife? the Lamb plays in the Sun

He starts\! he hears the foot of Man\! he says, Take thou my wool

But spare my life, but he knows not that \[*the*\] winter cometh fast.

The Spider sits in his labourd Web, eager watching for the Fly

Presently comes a famishd Bird & takes away the Spider

His Web is left all desolate, that his little anxious heart

So careful wove; & spread it out with sighs and weariness.

This was the Lamentation of Enion round the golden Feast

Eternity groand and was troubled at the image of Eternal Death

10  Without the body of Man an Exudation from his sickning limbs

Now Man was come to the Palm tree & to the Oak of Weeping

Which stand upon the Edge of Beulah & he sunk down

From the supporting arms of the Eternal Saviour; who disposd

The pale limbs of his Eternal Individuality

Upon The Rock of Ages. Watching over him with Love & Care

               \[*End of the First Night*\]

PAGE 21

Then those in Great Eternity met in the Council of God

As one Man for contracting their Exalted Senses

They behold Multitude or Expanding they behold as one

As One Man all the Universal family & that one Man

They call Jesus the Christ & they in him & he in them

Live in Perfect harmony in Eden the land of life

Consulting as One Man above \[*Mount Gilead*\] the

    Mountain of Snowdon Sublime

For messengers from Beulah come in tears & darkning clouds

Saying Shiloh is in ruins our brother is sick \[*Shiloh*\] Albion He

10  Whom thou lovest is sick he wanders from his house of Eternity

The daughters of Beulah terrified have closd the Gate of the Tongue

Luvah & Urizen contend in war around the holy tent

So spoke the Ambassadors from Beulah & with solemn mourning

They were introducd to the divine presence & they kneeled down

In \[*Beth Peor*\] Conways Vale thus recounting the Wars of Death Eternal

The Eternal Man wept in the holy tent Our Brother in Eternity

Even \[*Shiloh*\] Albion whom thou lovest wept in pain his family

Slept round on hills & valleys in the regions of his love

But Urizen awoke & Luvah woke & thus conferrd

20  Thou Luvah said the Prince of Light behold our sons & daughters

Reposd on beds. let them sleep on, do thou alone depart

Into thy wished Kingdom where in Majesty & Power

We may erect a throne. deep in the North I place my lot

Thou in the South listen attentive. In silent of this night

I will infold the Eternal tent in clouds opake while thou

Siezing the chariots of the morning. Go outfleeting ride

Afar into the Zenith high bending thy furious course

Southward with half the tents of men inclosd in clouds

Of Tharmas & Urthona. I remaining in porches of the brain

30  Will lay my scepter on Jerusalem the Emanation

On all her sons & on thy sons O Luvah & on mine

Till dawn was wont to wake them then my trumpet sounding loud

Ravishd away in night my strong command shall be obeyd

For I have placd my centinels in stations each tenth man

Is bought & sold & in dim night my Word shall be their law

PAGE 22

Luvah replied Dictate to thy Equals, am not I

The Prince of all the hosts of Men nor Equal know in Heaven

If I arise into the Zenith leaving thee to watch

The Emanation & her Sons the Satan & the Anak

Sihon and Og. wilt thou not rebel to my laws remain

In darkness building thy strong throne & in my ancient night

Daring my power wilt arm my sons against me in the \[*deep*\] Atlantic

My deep My night which thou assuming hast assumd my Crown

I will remain as well as thou & here with hands of blood

10   Smite this dark sleeper in his tent then try my strength with thee.

While thus he spoke his fires reddend \[*round*\] oer the holy tent

Urizen cast deep darkness round him silent brooding death

Eternal death to Luvah. raging Luvah pourd

The Lances of Urizen from chariots. round the holy tent

Discord began & yells & cries shook the wide firmament

Beside his anvil stood Urthona dark. a mass of iron

Glowd furious on the anvil prepard for spades & coulters All

His sons fled from his side to join the conflict pale he heard

The Eternal voice he stood the sweat chilld on his mighty limbs

20   He dropd his hammer, dividing from his aking bosom fled

A portion of his life shrieking upon the wind she fled

And Tharmas took her in pitying Then Enion in jealous fear

Murderd her & hid her in her bosom embalming her for fear

She should arise again to life Embalmd in Enions bosom

Enitharmon remains a corse such thing was never known

In Eden that one died a death never to be revivd

Urthona stood in terror but not long his spectre fled

To Enion & his body fell. Tharmas beheld him fall

Endlong a raging serpent rolling round the holy tent

30   The sons of war astonishd at the Glittring monster drove

Him far into the world of Tharmas into a cavernd rock

But Urizen with darkness overspreading all the armies

Sent round his heralds secretly commanding to depart

Into the north Sudden with thunders sound his multitudes

Retreat from the fierce conflict all the sons of Urizen at once

Mustring together in thick clouds leaving the rage of Luvah

To pour its fury on himself & on the Eternal Man

Sudden down fell they all together into an unknown Space

Deep horrible without End. Separated from Beulah far beneath

40   The Mans exteriors are become indefinite opend to pain

In a fierce hungring void & none can visit his regions

PAGE 19

Jerusalem his Emanation \[*will soon*\] is become a ruin

Her little ones \[*will be*\] are slain on the top of every street

And she herself le\[d\] captive & scatterd into \[*all nations*\] the indefinite

Gird on thy sword O thou most mighty in glory & majesty

Destroy these opressors of Jerusalem & those who ruin Shiloh

So spoke the Messengers of Beulah. Silently removing

The Family Divine drew up the Universal tent

Above \[*Mount Gilead*\] High Snowdon & closd the Messengers in clouds around

Till the time of the End. Then they Elected Seven. called the Seven

10  Eyes of God & the Seven lamps of the Almighty

The Seven are one within the other the Seventh is named Jesus

The Lamb of God blessed for ever & he followd the Man

Who wanderd in mount Ephraim seeking a Sepulcher

His inward eyes closing from the Divine vision & all

His children wandering outside from his bosom fleeing away

              \[*End of The First Night*\]

PAGE 20

The Daughters of Beulah beheld the Emanation they pitied

They wept before the Inner gates of Enitharmons bosom

And of her fine wrought brain & of her bowels within her loins

Three gates within Glorious & bright open into \[*Eternity*\] Beulah

From Enitharmons inward parts but the bright female terror

Refusd to open the bright gates she closd and barrd them fast

Lest Los should enter into Beulah thro her beautiful gates

The Emanation stood before the Gates of Enitharmon

Weeping, the Daughters of Beulah silent in the Porches

10  Spread her a couch unknown to Enitharmon here reposd

Jerusalem in slumbers soft lulld into silent rest

Terrific ragd the Eternal Wheels of intellect terrific ragd

The living creatures of the wheels in the Wars of Eternal life

But perverse rolld the wheels of Urizen & Luvah back reversd

Downwards & outwards \[*tending*\] consuming in the wars

     of Eternal Death

VALA

NIGHT THE \[SECOND\] \[*FIRST/THIRD*\]

Rising upon his Couch of Death Albion beheld his Sons

Turning his Eyes outward to Self. losing the Divine Vision

\[*The Man*\] Albion calld Urizen & said. Behold these

     sickning Spheres

Whence is this Voice of Enion that soundeth in my \[*Ears*\] Porches

Take thou possession\! take this Scepter\! go forth in my might

For I am weary, & must sleep in the dark sleep of Death

Thy brother Luvah hath smitten me but pity thou his youth

Tho thou hast not pitid my Age O Urizen Prince of Light

Urizen rose from the bright Feast like a star thro’ the evening sky

10   Exulting at the voice that calld him from the Feast of envy

First he beheld the body of Man pale, cold, the horrors of death

Beneath his feet shot thro’ him as he stood in the Human Brain

And all its golden porches grew pale with his sickening light

No more Exulting for he saw Eternal Death beneath

Pale he beheld futurity; pale he beheld the Abyss

Where Enion blind & age bent wept in direful hunger craving

All rav’ning like the hungry worm, & like the silent grave

PAGE 24

Mighty was the draught of Voidness to draw Existence in

Terrific Urizen strode above, in fear & pale dismay

He saw the indefinite space beneath & his soul shrunk with horror

His feet upon the verge of Non Existence; his voice went forth

Luvah & Vala trembling & shrinking, beheld the great Work master

And heard his Word\! Divide ye bands influence by influence

Build we a Bower for heavens darling in the grizly deep

Build we the Mundane Shell around the Rock of Albion

The Bands of Heaven flew thro the air singing & shouting to Urizen

10   Some fix’d the anvil, some the loom erected, some the plow

And harrow formd & framd the harness of silver & ivory

The golden compasses, the quadrant & the rule & balance

They erected the furnaces, they formd the anvils of gold beaten in mills

Where winter beats incessant, fixing them firm on their base

The bellows began to blow & the Lions of Urizen stood round the anvil

PAGE 25

And the leopards coverd with skins of beasts tended the roaring fires

Sublime distinct their lineaments divine of human beauty

The tygers of wrath called the horses of instruction from their mangers

They unloos’d them & put on the harness of gold & silver & ivory

In human forms distinct they stood round Urizen prince of Light

Petrifying all the Human Imagination into rock & sand

Groans ran along Tyburns brook and along the River of Oxford

Among the Druid Temples. Albion groand on Tyburns brook

Albion gave his loud death groan The Atlantic Mountains trembled

10   Aloft the Moon fled with a cry the Sun with streams of blood

From Albions Loins fled all Peoples and Nations of the Earth \[*Fled*\]

Fled with the noise of Slaughter & the stars of heaven Fled

Jerusalem came down in a dire ruin over all the Earth

She fell cold from Lambeths Vales in groans & Dewy death

The dew of anxious souls the death-sweat of the dying

In every pillard hall & arched roof of Albions skies

The brother & the brother bathe in blood upon the Severn

The Maiden weeping by. The father & the mother with

The Maidens father & her mother fainting over the body

20   And the Young Man the Murderer fleeing over the mountains

Reuben slept on Penmaenmawr & Levi slept on Snowdon

Their eyes their ears nostrils & tongues roll outward they behold

What is within now seen without they are raw to the hungry wind

They become Nations far remote in a little & dark Land

The Daughters of Albion girded around their garments of Needlework

Stripping Jerusalems curtains from mild demons of the hills

Across Europe & Asia to China & Japan like lightenings

They go forth & return to Albion on his rocky couch

Gwendolen Ragan Sabrina Gonorill Mehetabel Cordella

30   Boadicea Conwenna Estrild Gwinefrid Ignoge Cambel

Binding Jerusalems Children in the dungeons of Babylon

They play before the Armies before the hounds of Nimrod

While The Prince of Light on Salisbury plain among the druid stones

Rattling the adamantine chains & hooks heave up the orc

In mountainous masses, plung’d in furnaces, & they shut & seald

The furnaces a time & times; all the while blew the North

His cloudy bellows & the South & East & dismal West

And all the while the plow of iron cut the dreadful furrows

In Ulro beneath Beulah where the Dead wail Night & Day

40   Luvah was cast into the Furnaces of affliction & sealed

And Vala fed in cruel delight, the furnaces with fire

Stern Urizen beheld urg’d by necessity to keep

The evil day afar, & if perchance with iron power

He might avert his own despair; in woe & fear he saw

PAGE 26

Vala incircle round the furnaces where Luvah was clos’d

In joy she heard his howlings, & forgot he was her Luvah

With whom she walkd in bliss, in times of innocence & youth

Hear ye the voice of Luvah from the furnaces of Urizen

If I indeed am Valas King & ye O sons of Men

The workmanship of Luvahs hands; in times of Everlasting

When I called forth the Earth-worm from the cold & dark obscure

I nurturd her I fed her with my rains & dews, she grew

A scaled Serpent, yet I fed her tho’ she hated me

10   Day after day she fed upon the mountains in Luvahs sight

I brought her thro’ the Wilderness, a dry & thirsty land

And I commanded springs to rise for her in the black desart

Till she became a Dragon winged bright & poisonous

I opend all the floodgates of the heavens to quench her thirst

PAGE 27

And I commanded the Great deep to hide her in his hand

Till she became a little weeping Infant a span long

I carried her in my bosom as a man carries a lamb

I loved her I gave her all my soul & my delight

I hid her in soft gardens & in secret bowers of Summer

Weaving mazes of delight along the sunny paradise

Inextricable labyrinths, She bore me sons & daughters

And they have taken her away & hid her from my sight

They have surrounded me with walls of iron & brass, O Lamb

10   Of God clothed in Luvahs garments little knowest thou

Of death Eternal that we all go to Eternal Death

To our Primeval Chaos in fortuitous concourse of incoherent

Discordant principles of Love & Hate I suffer affliction

Because I love. for I \[*am*\] was love \[&\] but hatred awakes in me

And Urizen who was Faith & Certainty is changd to Doubt

The hand of Urizen is upon me because I blotted out

That Human \[*terror*\] delusion to deliver all the sons of God

From bondage of the Human form, O first born Son of Light

O Urizen my enemy I weep for thy stern ambition

20   But weep in vain O when will you return Vala the Wanderer

PAGE 28

These were the words of Luvah patient in afflictions

Reasoning from the loins in the unreal forms of Ulros night

And when Luvah age after age was quite melted with woe

The fires of Vala faded like a shadow cold & pale

An evanescent shadow. last she fell a heap of Ashes

Beneath the furnaces a woful heap in living death

Then were the furnaces unseald with spades & pickaxes

Roaring let out the fluid, the molten metal ran in channels

Cut by the plow of ages held in Urizens strong hand

In many a valley, for the Bulls of Luvah dragd the Plow 10

With trembling horror pale aghast the Children of \[*Men*\] Man

Stood on the infinite Earth & saw these visions in the air

In waters & in Earth beneath they cried to one another

What are we terrors to one another. Come O brethren wherefore

Was this wide Earth spread all abroad. not for wild beasts to roam

But many stood silent & busied in their families

And many said We see no Visions in the darksom air

Measure the course of that sulphur orb that lights the

     \[*dismal*\] darksom day

Set stations on this breeding Earth & let us buy & sell

20   Others arose & schools Erected forming Instruments

To measure out the course of heaven. Stern Urizen beheld

In woe his brethren & his Sons in darkning woe lamenting

Upon the winds in clouds involvd Uttering his voice in thunders

Commanding all the work with care & power & severity

Then siezd the Lions of Urizen their work, & heated in the forge

Roar the bright masses, thund’ring beat the hammers, many a \[*Globe*\] pyramid

Is form’d & thrown down thund’ring into the deeps of Non Entity

Heated red hot they hizzing rend their way down many a league

Till resting. each his \[*center/basement*\] finds; suspended there they stand

30   Casting their sparkles dire abroad into the dismal deep

For measurd out in orderd spaces the Sons of Urizen

With compasses divide the deep; they the strong scales erect

PAGE 29

That Luvah rent from the faint Heart of the \[*Eternal/Ancient*\] Fallen Man

And weigh the massy \[*Globes*\] Cubes, then fix them in their awful stations

And all the time in Caverns shut, the golden Looms erected

First spun, then wove the Atmospheres, there the Spider & Worm

Plied the wingd shuttle piping shrill thro’ all the list’ning threads

Beneath the Caverns roll the weights of lead & spindles of iron

The enormous warp & woof rage direful in the affrighted deep

While far into the vast unknown, the strong wing’d Eagles bend

Their venturous flight, in Human forms distinct; thro darkness deep

10   They bear the woven draperies; on golden hooks they hang abroad

The universal curtains & spread out from Sun to Sun

The vehicles of light, they separate the furious particles

Into mild currents as the water mingles with the wine.

While thus the Spirits of strongest wing enlighten the dark deep

The threads are spun & the cords twisted & drawn out; then the weak

Begin their work; & many a net is netted; many a net

PAGE 30

Spread & many a Spirit caught, innumerable the nets

Innumerable the gins & traps; & many a soothing flute

Is form’d & many a corded lyre, outspread over the immense

In cruel delight they trap the listeners, & in cruel delight

Bind them, \[*together*\] condensing the strong energies into little compass

Some became seed of every plant that shall be planted; some

The bulbous roots, thrown up together into barns & garners

Then rose the Builders; First the Architect divine his plan

Unfolds, The wondrous scaffold reard all round the infinite

10   Quadrangular the building rose the heavens squared by a line.

Trigons & cubes divide the elements in finite bonds

Multitudes without number work incessant: the hewn stone

Is placd in beds of mortar mingled with the ashes of Vala

Severe the labour, female slaves the mortar trod oppressed

Twelve halls after the names of his twelve sons composd

The \[*golden*\] wondrous building & three Central

     Domes after the Names

Of his three daughters were encompassed by the twelve bright halls

Every hall surrounded by bright Paradises of Delight

In which \[*were*\] are towns & Cities Nations Seas Mountains & Rivers

20   Each Dome opend toward four halls & the Three

     Domes Encompassd

The Golden Hall of Urizen whose western side glowd bright

With ever streaming fires beaming from his awful limbs

His Shadowy Feminine Semblance here reposd on a

     \[*bright*\] White Couch

Or hoverd oer his Starry head & when he smild she brightend

Like a bright Cloud in harvest. but when Urizen frownd she wept

In mists over his carved throne & when he turnd his back

Upon his Golden hall & sought the Labyrinthine porches

Of his wide heaven Trembling, cold in paling fears she sat

A shadow of Despair therefore toward the West Urizen formd

30   A recess in the wall for fires to glow upon the pale

Females limbs in his absence & her Daughters oft upon

A Golden Altar burnt perfumes with Art Celestial formd

Foursquare sculpturd & sweetly Engravd to please their

     shadowy mother

Ascending into her \[*cloudy*\] misty garments the blue

     smoke rolld to revive

Her cold limbs in the absence of her Lord. Also her sons

With lives of Victims sacrificed upon an altar of brass

On the East side. Revivd her Soul with lives of beasts & birds

Slain on the Altar up ascending into her cloudy bosom

Of terrible workmanship the Altar labour of ten thousand Slaves

40   One thousand Men of wondrous power spent their lives in its formation

It stood on twelve steps namd after the names of her twelve sons

And was Erected at the chief entrance of Urizens hall

When Urizen \[*descended*\] returnd from his immense labours & travels

Descending she reposd beside him folding him around

In her bright skirts. Astonished & Confounded he beheld

Her shadowy form now Separate he shudderd & was silent

Till her caresses & her tears revivd him to life & joy

Two wills they had two intellects & not as in times of old

This Urizen percievd & silent brooded in darkning Clouds

50   To him his Labour was but Sorrow & his Kingdom was  
        Repentance

He drave the Male Spirits all away from Ahania

And she drave all the Females from him away

Los joyd & Enitharmon laughd, saying Let us go down

And see this labour & sorrow; They went down to see the woes

Of Vala & the woes of Luvah, to draw in their delights

And Vala like a shadow oft appeard to Urizen

PAGE 31

The King of Light beheld her mourning among the Brick kilns compelld

To labour night & day among the fires, her lamenting voice

Is heard when silent night returns & the labourers take their rest

O Lord wilt thou not look upon our sore afflictions

Among these flames incessant labouring, our hard masters laugh

At all our sorrow. We are made to turn the wheel for water

To carry the heavy basket on our scorched shoulders, to sift

The sand & ashes, & to mix the clay with tears & repentance

I see not Luvah as of old I only see his feet

10   Like pillars of fire travelling thro darkness & non entity

The times are now returnd upon us, we have given ourselves

To scorn and now are scorned by the slaves of our enemies

Our beauty is coverd over with clay & ashes, & our backs

Furrowd with whips, & our flesh bruised with the heavy basket

Forgive us O thou piteous one whom we have offended, forgive

The weak remaining shadow of Vala that returns in sorrow to thee.

Thus she lamented day & night, compelld to labour & sorrow

Luvah in vain her lamentations heard; in vain his love

Brought him in various forms before her still she knew him not

PAGE 32

Still she despisd him, calling on his name & knowing him not

Still hating still professing love, still labouring in the smoke

And Los & Enitharmon joyd, they drank in tenfold joy  
From all the sorrow of Luvah & the labour of Urizen  
And Enitharmon joyd Plotting to rend the secret cloud  
To plant divisions in the Soul of Urizen & Ahania

\[*For*\] But infinitely beautiful the wondrous work arose

In \[*songs & joy*\] sorrow & care, a Golden World whose  
    porches round the heavens

And pillard halls & rooms recievd the eternal wandering stars

10   A wondrous golden Building; many a window many a door

And many a division let in & out into the vast unknown

\[*Circled/Cubed*\] in \[*infinite orb/window square*\]  
    immoveable, within its \[*arches all*\] walls & cielings

The heavens were closd and spirits mournd their  
    bondage night and day

And the Divine Vision appeard in Luvahs robes of blood

Thus was the Mundane shell builded by Urizens strong power

\[*Then*\] Sorrowing went the Planters forth to plant, the  
    Sowers \[*forth*\] to sow

They dug the channels for the rivers & they pourd abroad

PAGE 33

The seas & lakes, they reard the mountains & the rocks & hills

On broad pavilions, on pillard roofs & porches & high towers

In beauteous order, thence arose soft clouds & exhalations

Wandering even to the sunny \[*orbs*\] Cubes of light & heat

For many a window ornamented with sweet ornaments

Lookd out into the World of Tharmas, where in ceaseless torrents

His billows roll where monsters wander in the foamy paths

On clouds the Sons of Urizen beheld Heaven walled round

They weighd & orderd all & Urizen comforted saw

10   The wondrous work flow forth like visible out of the invisible

For the Divine Lamb Even Jesus who is the Divine Vision

Permitted all lest Man should fall into Eternal Death

For when Luvah sunk down himself put on the robes of blood

Lest the state calld Luvah should cease. & the Divine Vision

Walked in robes of blood till he who slept should awake

Thus were the stars of heaven created. like a golden chain

To bind the Body of Man to heaven from falling into  
    the Abyss

Each took his station, & his course began with \[*songs &  
    joy*\] sorrow & care

In sevens & tens & fifties, hundreds, thousands, numberd all

20   According to their various powers. Subordinate to Urizen

And to his sons in their degrees & to his beauteous daughters

Travelling in silent majesty along their orderd ways

In right lined paths outmeasurd by proportions of  
    \[*weight* & *measure*\] number weight

And measure, mathematic motion wondrous. along the deep

In fiery pyramid. or Cube. or unornamented pillar square

Of fire far shining. travelling along even to its destind end

Then falling down. a terrible space recovring in winter dire

Its wasted strength. it back returns upon a nether course

Till fired with ardour fresh recruited in its humble  
    \[*spring*\] season

30   It rises up on high all summer till its wearied course

Turns into autumn, such the periods of many worlds

Others triangular \[*their*\] right angled course maintain. others obtuse

Acute \[& *oblong*\] Scalene, in simple paths. but others move

In intricate ways biquadrate. Trapeziums Rhombs Rhomboids

Paralellograms. triple & quadruple. polygonic

In their amazing \[*fructifying*\] hard subdued course in  
    the vast deep

PAGE 34

And Los & Enitharmon were drawn down by their desires

Descending sweet upon the wind among soft harps & voices

To plant divisions in the Soul of Urizen & Ahania

To conduct the Voice of Enion to Ahanias midnight pillow

Urizen saw & envied & his imagination was filled

Repining he contemplated the past in his bright sphere

Terrified with his heart & spirit at the visions of futurity

That his dread fancy formd before him in the unformd void

\[*Now*\] For Los & Enitharmon walkd forth on the dewy Earth

10   Contracting or expanding their all flexible senses

At will to murmur in the flowers small as the honey bee

At will to stretch across the heavens & step from star to star

Or standing on the Earth erect, or on the stormy waves

Driving the storms before them or delighting in sunny beams

While round their heads the Elemental Gods kept harmony

And Los said. Lo the Lilly pale & the rose reddning fierce

Reproach thee & the beamy gardens sicken at thy beauty

I grasp thy vest in my strong hand in vain. like water springs

In the bright sands of Los. evading my embrace. then I alone

20   Wander among the virgins of the summer Look they cry

The poor forsaken Los mockd by the worm the shelly snail

The Emmet & the beetle hark they laugh & mock at Los

Enitharmon answerd Secure now from the smitings of  
    thy Power

Demon of fury If the God enrapturd me infolds

In clouds of sweet obscurity my beauteous form dissolving

Howl thou over the body of death tis thine But if among the virgins

Of summer I have seen thee sleep & turn thy cheek delighted

Upon the rose or lilly pale. or on a bank where sleep

The beamy daughters of the light starting they rise they flee

30   From thy fierce love for tho I am dissolvd in the bright God

My spirit still pursues thy false love over rocks & valleys

Los answerd Therefore fade I thus dissolvd in rapturd trance

70   Thou canst repose on clouds of secrecy while oer my limbs

Cold dews & hoary frost creeps tho I lie on banks of summer

Among the beauties of the World Cold & repining Los

Still dies for Enitharmon nor a spirit springs from my dead corse

Then I am dead till thou revivest me with thy sweet song

Now taking on Ahanias form & now the form of Enion

I know thee not as once I knew thee in those blessed fields

40   Where memory wishes to repose among the flocks of Tharmas

Enitharmon answerd Wherefore didst thou throw thine arms around

Ahanias Image I decievd thee & will still decieve

Urizen saw thy sin & hid his beams in darkning Clouds

I still keep watch altho I tremble & wither across the heavens

In strong vibrations of fierce jealousy for thou art mine

Created for my will my slave tho strong tho I am weak

Farewell the God calls me away I depart in my sweet bliss

She fled vanishing on the wind And left a dead cold corse

In Los’s arms howlings began over the body of death

50   Los spoke. Thy God in vain shall call thee if by my strong power

I can infuse my dear revenge into his glowing breast

Then jealousy shall shadow all his mountains & Ahania

Curse thee thou plague of woful Los & seek revenge on thee

So saying in deep sobs he languishd till dead he also fell

Night passd & Enitharmon eer the dawn returnd in bliss

She sang Oer Los. reviving him to Life his groans were terrible

But thus she sang I sieze the sphery harp I strike the strings

At the first Sound the Golden sun arises from the Deep

And shakes his awful hair

60   The Eccho wakes the moon to unbind her silver locks

The golden sun bears on my song

And nine bright spheres of harmony rise round the fiery King

The joy of woman is the Death of her most best beloved

Who dies for Love of her

In torments of fierce jealousy & pangs of adoration

The Lovers night bears on my song

And the nine Spheres rejoice beneath my powerful controll

They sing unceasing to the notes of my immortal hand

The solemn silent moon

70   Reverberates the living harmony upon my limbs 

The birds & beasts rejoice & play

And every one seeks for his mate to prove his inmost joy

Furious & terrible they sport & rend the nether deeps

The deep lifts up his rugged head

And lost in infinite hum\[m\]ing wings vanishes with a cry

The fading cry is ever dying

The living voice is ever living in its inmost joy

Arise you little glancing wings & sing your infant joy

Arise & drink your bliss

80   For every thing that lives is holy for the source of life

Descends to be a weeping babe

For the Earthworm renews the moisture of the sandy plain

Now my left hand I stretch to earth beneath

And strike the terrible string

I wake sweet joy in dens of sorrow & I plant a smile

In forests of affliction

And wake the bubbling springs of life in regions of dark death

O I am weary lay thine hand upon me or I faint

I faint beneath these beams of thine

90   For thou hast touchd my five senses & they answerd thee

Now I am nothing & I sink

And on the bed of silence sleep till thou awakest me

Thus sang the Lovely one in Rapturous delusive trance

Los heard \[*delighted*\] reviving he siezd her in his arms  
    delusive hopes

Kindling She led him into Shadows & thence fled outstretchd

Upon the immense like a bright rainbow weeping &  
    smiling & fading

Thus livd Los driving Enion far into the deathful infinite

That he may also draw Ahania’s spirit into her Vortex

Ah happy blindness \[*she*\] Enion sees not the terrors of the uncertain

100 Thus Enion wails from the dark deep, the golden heavens tremble

PAGE 35

I am made to sow the thistle for wheat; the nettle for a  
    nourishing dainty

I have planted a false oath in the earth, it has brought  
    forth a poison tree

I have chosen the serpent for a councellor & the dog

For a schoolmaster to my children

I have blotted out from light & living the dove & nightingale

And I have caused the earth worm to beg from door to door

I have taught the thief a secret path into the house of the just

I have taught pale artifice to spread his nets upon the morning

My heavens are brass my earth is iron my moon a clod of clay

10   My sun a pestilence burning at noon & a vapour of death in night

What is the price of Experience do men buy it for a song

Or wisdom for a dance in the street? No it is bought with the price

Of all that a man hath his house his wife his children

Wisdom is sold in the desolate market where none come to buy

And in the witherd field where the farmer plows for bread in vain

It is an easy thing to triumph in the summers sun

And in the vintage & to sing on the waggon loaded with corn

It is an easy thing to talk of patience to the afflicted

To speak the laws of prudence to the houseless wanderer

PAGE 36

To listen to the hungry ravens cry in wintry season

When the red blood is filld with wine & with the marrow of lambs

It is an easy thing to laugh at wrathful elements

To hear the dog howl at the wintry door, the ox in the slaughter house moan

To see a god on every wind & a blessing on every blast

To hear sounds of love in the thunder storm that destroys our enemies house

To rejoice in the blight that covers his field, & thesickness that cuts off his children

While our olive & vine sing & laugh round our door &our children bring fruits & flowers

Then the groan & the dolor are quite forgotten & theslave grinding at the mill

10   And the captive in chains & the poor in the prison, & the soldier in the field

When the shatterd bone hath laid him groaning among the happier dead

It is an easy thing to rejoice in the tents of prosperity

Thus could I sing & thus rejoice, but it is not so with me\!

            \[*End of the Second Night*\]

Ahania heard the Lamentation & a swift Vibration

Spread thro her Golden frame. She rose up eer the dawn of day

When Urizen slept on his couch. drawn thro unbounded space

Onto the margin of Non Entity the bright Female came

There she beheld the \[*terrible*\] Spectrous form of Enion in the Void

And never from that moment could she rest upon her pillow



            End of the Second Night



PAGE 37

VALA

NIGHT THE \[? *First?Third*\] THIRD

Now sat the King of Light on high upon his starry throne

And bright Ahania bow’d herself before his splendid feet

O Urizen look on \[*thy wife that*\] Me. like a  
    mournful stream

I Embrace\[*s*\] round thy knees & wet\[*s her*\] My bright  
    hair with \[*her*\] My tears.

Why sighs my Lord\! are not the morning stars thy  
    obedient Sons

Do they not bow their bright heads at thy voice? at thy  
    command

Do they not fly into their stations & return their light to thee

The immortal Atmospheres are thine, there thou art seen in glory

Surrounded by the ever changing Daughters of the Light

10   \[*Thou sitst in harmony for God hath set thee over all*\]

Why wilt thou look upon futurity darkning present joy

She ceas’d the Prince his light obscurd & the splendors of his crown

PAGE 38

Infolded in thick clouds, from whence his mighty voice burst forth

O bright \[*Ahania/shadow*\] a Boy is born of the dark Ocean

Whom Urizen doth serve, with Light replenishing his darkness

I am set here a King of trouble commanded here to serve

And do my ministry to those who eat of my wide table

All this is mine yet I must serve & that Prophetic boy

Must grow up to command his Prince \[*& all my Kingly*  
    *power*\] but hear my determind Decree

\[*But*\] Vala shall become a Worm in Enitharmons Womb

Laying her seed upon the fibres soon to issue forth

10   And Luvah in the loins of Los a dark & furious death

Alas for me\! what will become of me at that dread time?

Ahania bow’d her head & wept seven days before the King

And on the eighth day when his clouds unfolded from his throne

She rais’d her bright head sweet perfumd & thus with heavenly voice

O Prince the Eternal One hath set thee leader of his hosts

\[*Raise then thy radiant eyes to him raise thy obedient hands*

*And comforts shall descend from heaven into thy*  
    *darkning clouds*\]

Leave all futurity to him resume thy fields of Light

Why didst thou listen to the voice of Luvah that dread morn

To give the immortal steeds of light to his deceitful hands

No longer now obedient to thy will thou art compell’d

To forge the curbs of iron & brass to build the iron mangers

To feed them with intoxication from the wine presses of Luvah

Till the Divine Vision & Fruition is quite obliterated

10   They call thy lions to the fields of blood, they rowze thy tygers

Out of the halls of justice, till these dens thy wisdom framd

Golden & beautiful but O how unlike those sweet fields of bliss

Where liberty was justice & eternal science was mercy

Then O my dear lord listen to Ahania, listen to the vision

The vision of Ahania in the slumbers of Urizen

When Urizen slept in the porch & the \[*Eternal*\] Ancient  
    Man was smitten

The \[*Eternal/Fallen*\] Darkning Man walkd on the steps  
    of fire before his halls

And Vala walkd with him in dreams of soft deluding  
    slumber

He looked up & saw \[*the*\] thee Prince of Light \[*with*\] thy splendor faded

20   \[*But saw not Los nor Enitharmon for Luvah hid them in shadow*\]

PAGE 40

\[*of*\] \[*In a soft cloud Outstretch’d across, & Luvah dwelt in the cloud*\]

Then Man ascended mourning into the splendors of his palace

Above him rose a Shadow from his wearied intellect

Of living gold, pure, perfect, holy; in white linen pure he hover’d

A sweet entrancing self delusion, a watry vision of Man

Soft exulting in existence all the Man absorbing

Man fell upon his face prostrate before the watry shadow

Saying O Lord whence is this change thou knowest I am  
    nothing

And Vala trembled & coverd her face, & her locks.  
    were spread on the pavement

10   I heard astonishd at the Vision & my heart trembled  
        within me

I heard the voice of the Slumberous Man & thus he spoke

Idolatrous to his own Shadow words of Eternity uttering

O I am nothing when I enter into judgment with thee

If thou withdraw thy breath I die & vanish into Hades

If thou dost lay thine hand upon me behold I am silent

If thou withhold thine hand I perish like a fallen leaf

O I am nothing & to nothing must return again

If thou withdraw thy breath, behold I am oblivion

He ceasd: the shadowy voice was silent; but the cloud hoverd over their heads

PAGE 41

In golden wreathes, the sorrow of Man & the balmy  
    drops fell down

And Lo that Son of Man, that shadowy Spirit of the  
    \[*Eternal*\] Fallen One/Albion

Luvah, descended from the cloud; \[*The Eternal Man arose*\]  
    In terror Albion rose

Indignant rose the \[*Eternal/Fallen*\] Awful Man &  
      turnd his back on Vala

Why roll thy clouds in sick’ning mists. I can no longer hide

The dismal vision of mine Eyes, O love & life & light\!

Prophetic dreads urge me to speak. futurity is before me

Like a dark lamp. Eternal death haunts all my expectation

Rent from Eternal Brotherhood we die & are no more

10   I heard the Voice of the \[*Eternal/Falln One*\] Albion  
          starting from his sleep

Whence is this voice crying Enion that soundeth in my ears

O cruel pity\! O dark deceit\! can Love seek for dominion

And Luvah strove to gain dominion over the \[*Eternal*\]  
    Ancient Man/Mighty Albion

They strove together above the Body where Vala was inclos’d

And the dark body of \[*Man*\] Albion left prostrate upon  
    the crystal pavement

Coverd with boils from head to foot. the terrible smitings of Luvah

Then frownd the \[*Eternal*\] Fallen Man/Albion & put  
    forth Luvah from his presence

\(I heard him: frown not Urizen: but listen to my Vision\)

PAGE 42

Saying, Go & die the Death of Man for Vala the sweet wanderer

I will turn the volutions of your Ears outward; & bend your Nostrils

Downward; & your fluxile Eyes englob’d, roll round in fear

Your withring Lips & Tongue shrink up into a narrow circle

Till into narrow forms you creep. Go take your fiery way

And learn what ’tis to absorb the Man you Spirits of Pity & Love

O Urizen why art thou pale at the visions of Ahania

Listen to her who loves thee lest we also are driven away.

They heard the Voice & fled swift as the winters setting sun

10   And now the Human Blood foamd high, I saw that Luvah & Vala

Went down the Human Heart where Paradise & its joys abounded

In jealous fears in fury & rage, & flames roll’d round their fervid feet

And the vast form of Nature like a Serpent play’d before them

And as they went in folding fires & thunders of the deep

Vala shrunk in like the dark sea that leaves its slimy banks

And from her bosom Luvah fell far as the east & west

And the vast form of Nature like a Serpent roll’d between.

Whether this is Jerusalem or Babylon we know not.

All is Confusion All is tumult & we alone are escaped

20   She ended. for his wrathful throne burst forth the black hail storm

Am I not God said Urizen. Who is Equal to me

Do I not stretch the heavens abroad or fold them up like a garment

He spoke mustering his heavy clouds around him black opake

PAGE 43

Then thunders rolld around & lightnings darted to & fro

His visage changd to darkness & his strong right hand came forth

To cast Ahania to the Earth he siezd her by the hair

And threw her from the steps of ice that froze around his throne

Saying Art thou also become like Vala. thus I cast thee out

Shall the feminine indolent bliss. the indulgent self of weariness

The passive idle sleep the enormous night & darkness of Death

Set herself up to give her laws to the active masculine virtue

Thou little diminutive portion that darst be a counterpart

10   Thy passivity thy laws of obedience & insincerity

Are my abhorrence. Wherefore hast thou taken that fair form

Whence is this power given to thee\! once thou wast in my breast

A sluggish current of dim waters on whose verdant margin

A cavern shaggd with horrid shades. dark cool & deadly. where

I laid my head in the hot noon after the broken clods

Had wearied me. there I laid my plow & there my horses fed

And thou hast risen with thy moist locks into a watry image

Reflecting all my indolence my weakness & my death

To weigh me down beneath the grave into non Entity

20   Where Luvah strives scorned by Vala age after age wandering

Shrinking & shrinking from her Lord & calling him the Tempter

And art thou also become like Vala thus I cast thee out.

So loud in thunders spoke the King folded in dark despair

And threw Ahania from his bosom obdurate She fell like lightning

Then fled the sons of Urizen from his thunderous throne petrific

They fled to East & West & left the North & South of Heaven

A crash ran thro the immense The bounds of Destiny were broken

The bounds of Destiny crashd direful & the swelling Sea

Burst from its bonds in whirlpools fierce roaring with Human voice

30   Triumphing even to the Stars at bright Ahanias fall

Down from the dismal North the Prince in thunders & thick clouds

PAGE 44

As when the thunderbolt down falleth on the appointed place

Fell down down rushing ruining thundering \[*darkning*\] shuddering

Into the Caverns of the Grave & places of Human Seed

Where the impressions of Despair & Hope enroot forever

A world of Darkness. Ahania fell far into Non Entity

She Continued falling. Loud the Crash continud loud & Hoarse

From the Crash roared a flame of blue sulphureous fire from the flame

A dolorous groan that struck with dumbness all confusion

Swallowing up the horrible din in agony on agony

10   Thro the Confusion like a crack across from immense  
          to immense

Loud strong a universal groan of death louder

Than all the wracking elements deafend & rended worse

Than Urizen & all his hosts in curst despair down rushing

But from the Dolorous Groan one like a shadow of smoke appeard

And human bones rattling together in the smoke & stamping

The nether Abyss & gnasshing in fierce despair. panting in sobs

Thick short incessant bursting sobbing. deep despairing  
    stamping struggling

Struggling to utter the voice of Man struggling to take  
    the features of Man. Struggling

To take the limbs of Man at length emerging from the smoke

20   Of Urizen dashed in pieces from his precipitant fall

Tharmas reard up his hands & stood on the affrighted Ocean

The dead reard up his Voice & stood on the resounding shore

Crying. Fury in my limbs. destruction in my bones & marrow

My skull riven into filaments. my eyes into sea jellies

Floating upon the tide wander bubbling & bubbling

Uttering my lamentations & begetting little monsters

Who sit mocking upon the little pebbles of the tide

In all my rivers & on dried shells that the fish

PAGE 45

Have quite forsaken. O fool fool to lose my sweetest bliss

Where art thou Enion ah too near to cunning too far off

And yet too near. Dashd down I send thee into distant darkness

Far as my strength can hurl thee wander there & laugh & play

Among the frozen arrows they will tear thy tender flesh

Fall off afar from Tharmas come not too near my strong fury

Scream & fall off & laugh at Tharmas lovely summer beauty

Till winter rends thee into Shivers as thou hast rended me

So Tharmas bellowd oer the ocean thundring sobbing bursting

10   The bounds of Destiny were broken & hatred now began

Instead of love to Enion. Enion blind & age bent

Plungd into the cold billows living a life in midst of waters

In terrors she witherd away to Entuthon Benithon

A world of deep darkness where all things in horrors are rooted

These are the words of Enion heard from the cold waves of despair

O Tharmas I had lost thee. & when I hoped I had found thee

O Tharmas do not thou destroy me quite but let

A little shadow. but a little showery form of Enion

Be near thee loved Terror. let me still remain & then do thou

20   Thy righteous doom upon me. only let me hear thy voice

Driven by thy rage I wander like a cloud into the deep

Where never yet Existence came, there losing all my life

I back return weaker & weaker, consume me not away

In thy great wrath. tho I have sinned. tho I have rebelld

Make me not like the things forgotten as they had not been

Make not the thing that loveth thee. a tear wiped away

Tharmas replied riding on storms \[*the*\] his voice of  
      \[*Tharmas*\] Thunder rolld

Image of grief thy fading lineaments make my eyelids fail

What have I done\! both rage & mercy are alike to me

30   Looking upon thee Image of faint waters. I recoil

From my fierce rage into thy semblance. Enion return

Why does thy piteous face Evanish like a rainy cloud

PAGE 46

Melting, a shower of falling tears. nothing but tears\! Enion:

Substanceless. voiceless, weeping. vanishd. nothing but tears\! Enion

Art thou for ever vanishd from the watry eyes of Tharmas

Rage Rage shall never from my bosom. winds & waters of woe

Consuming all to the end consuming Love and \[*Joy*\]  
      Hope are ended

For now no more remaind of Enion in the dismal air

Only a voice eternal wailing in the Elements

Where Enion, blind & age bent wanderd Ahania wanders now

She wanders in Eternal fear of falling into the indefinite

10   For her bright eyes behold the Abyss. Sometimes a little sleep

Weighs down her eyelids then she falls then starting wakes in fears

Sleepless to wander round repelld on the margin of Non Entity

            The End of the Third Night

NIGHT THE FOURTH

But Tharmas rode on the dark Abyss, the voice of  
    Tharmas rolld

Over the heaving deluge. he saw Los & Enitharmon  
    Emerge

In strength & brightness from the Abyss his bowels  
    yearnd over them

They rose in strength above the heaving deluge. in mighty scorn

Red as the Sun in the hot morning of the bloody day

Tharmas beheld them his bowels yearnd over them

And he said Wherefore do I feel such love & pity

Ah Enion Ah Enion Ah lovely lovely Enion

How is this All my hope is gone \[*Enion*\] for ever fled

10   Like a famishd Eagle Eyeless raging in the vast expanse

Incessant tears are now my food. incessant rage & tears

Deathless for ever now I wander seeking oblivion

In torrents of despair in vain. for if I plunge beneath

Stifling I live. If dashd in pieces from a rocky height

I reunite in endless torment. would I had never risen

From deaths cold sleep \[*upon*\] beneath the bottom of the  
    raging Ocean

And cannot those who once have lovd. ever forget their Love?

Are love & rage the same passion? they are the same in me

Are those who love. like those who died. risen again from death

20   Immortal, in immortal torment, never to be deliverd

Is it not possible that one risen again from Death

Can die\! When dark despair comes over can I not

Flow down into the sea & slumber in oblivion. Ah Enion

PAGE 48

Deformd I see these lineaments of ungratified Desire

The all powerful curse of an honest man be upon Urizen & Luvah

But thou My Son Glorious in brightness comforter of Tharmas

Go forth Rebuild this Universe beneath my indignant power

A Universe of Death & Decay. Let Enitharmons hands

Weave soft delusive forms of Man above my watry world

Renew these ruind souls of Men thro Earth Sea Air & Fire

To waste in endless corruption. renew thou I will destroy

Perhaps Enion may resume some little semblance

10   To ease my pangs of heart & to restore some peace to Tharmas

Los answerd in his furious pride sparks issuing from his hair

Hitherto shalt thou come. no further. here thy proud waves cease

We have drunk up the Eternal Man by our unbounded power

Beware lest we also drink up thee rough demon of the waters

Our God is Urizen the King. King of the Heavenly hosts

We have no other God but he thou father of worms & clay

And he is falln into the Deep rough Demon of the waters

And Los remains God over all. weak father of worms & clay

I know I was Urthona keeper of the gates of heaven

20   But now I am all powerful Los & Urthona is but my shadow

Doubting stood Tharmas in the \[*dismal*\] solemn  
    darkness. his dim Eyes

Swam in red tears. he reard his waves above the head of Los

In wrath. but pitying back withdrew with many a sigh

Now he resolvd to destroy Los & now his tears flowd down

In scorn stood Los red sparks of blighting from his furious head

Flew over the waves of Tharmas. pitying Tharmas stayd his Waves

For Enitharmon shriekd amain crying O my sweet world

Built by the Architect divine whose love to Los & Enitharmon

Thou rash abhorred Demon in thy fury hast oerthrown

PAGE 49

What Sovereign Architect said Tharmas dare my will controll

For if I will urge these waters. If I will they sleep

In peace beneath my awful frown my will shall be my Law

So saying in a Wave he rap’d bright Enitharmon far

Apart from Los. but coverd her with softest brooding care

On a broad wave in the warm west. balming her bleeding wound

O how Los howld at the rending asunder all the fibres rent

Where Enitharmon joind to his left side in \[*dismal*\] griding pain

He falling on the rocks bellowd his Dolor. till the blood

10   Stanch’d, then in ululation waild his woes upon the wind

And Tharmas calld to the Dark Spectre who upon the Shores

With dislocated Limbs had falln. The Spectre rose in pain

A Shadow blue obscure & dismal. like a statue of lead

Bent by its fall from a high tower the dolorous shadow rose

Go forth said Tharmas works of joy are thine obey & live

So shall the spungy marrow issuing from thy splinterd bones

Bonify. & thou shalt have rest when this thy labour is done

Go forth bear Enitharmon back to the Eternal Prophet

Build her a bower in the midst of all my dashing waves

20   Make first a resting place for Los & Enitharmon. then

Thou shalt have rest. If thou refusest dashd abroad on all

My waves. thy limbs shall separate in stench & rotting & thou

Become a prey to all my demons of despair & hope

The Spectre of Urthona \[*answerd*\] seeing Enitharmon writhd

His cloudy form in jealous fear & muttering thunders hoarse

And casting round thick glooms. thus utterd his fierce pangs of heart

Tharmas I know thee. how are we alterd our beauty decayd

But still I know thee tho in this horrible ruin whelmd

Thou once the mildest son of heaven art now become a Rage

30   A terror to all living things. think not that I am ignorant

That thou art risen from the dead or that my power forgot

PAGE 50

I slumber here in weak repose. I well remember the Day

The day of terror & abhorrence \[*eternal*\]

When fleeing from the battle thou fleeting like the raven

Of dawn outstretching an expanse where neer expanse had been

Drewst all the Sons of Beulah into thy \[*great*\] dread  
    vortex following

Thy Eddying spirit down the hills of Beulah. All my sons

Stood round me at the anvil where new heated the wedge

Of iron glowd furious prepard for spades & mattocks

Hearing the symphonies of war loud sounding All my sons

10   Fled from my side then pangs smote me unknown before. I saw

My loins begin to break forth into veiny pipes & writhe

Before me in the wind englobing trembling with strong vibrations

The bloody mass began to animate. I bending over

Wept bitter tears incessant. Still beholding how the piteous form

Dividing & dividing from my loins a weak & piteous

Soft cloud of snow a female pale & weak I soft embracd

My counter part & calld it Love I named her Enitharmon

But found myself & her together issuing down the tide

Which now our rivers were become delving thro caverns huge



20        Of goary blood strugg\[l\]ing to be deliverd from our bonds

She strove in vain not so Urthona strove for breaking forth,

A shadow blue obscure & dismal from the breathing Nostrils

Of Enion I issued into the air divided from Enitharmon

I howld in sorrow I beheld thee rotting upon the Rocks

I pitying hoverd over thee I protected thy ghastly corse

From Vultures of the deep then wherefore shouldst thou rage

Against me who thee guarded in the night of death from harm

Tharmas replied. Art thou Urthona My friend my old companion

With whom I livd in happiness before that deadly night

30        When Urizen gave the horses of Light into the hands of Luvah

Thou knowest not what Tharmas knows. O I could tell thee tales

That would enrage thee as it has Enraged me even

From Death in wrath & fury. But now come bear back

Thy loved Enitharmon. For thou hast her here before thine Eyes

PAGE 51

But my sweet Enion is vanishd & I never more

Shall see her unless thou O Shadow. wilt protect this Son

Of Enion & him assist. to bind the fallen King

Lest he should rise again from death in all his \[*dismal*\] dreary power

Bind him, take Enitharmon for thy sweet reward while I

In vain am driven on false hope. hope sister of despair

Groaning the terror rose & drave his solid rocks before

Upon the tide till underneath the feet of Los a World

Dark dreadful rose & Enitharmon lay at Los’s feet

10       The dolorous shadow joyd. weak hope appeard around his head

Tharmas before Los stood & thus the Voice of Tharmas rolld

Now all comes into the power of Tharmas. Urizen is falln

And Luvah hidden in the Elemental forms of Life & Death

Urthona is My Son O Los thou art Urthona & Tharmas

Is God. The Eternal Man is seald never to be deliverd

I roll my floods over his body my billows & waves pass over him

The Sea encompasses him & monsters of the deep are his companions

Dreamer of furious oceans cold sleeper of weeds & shells

Thy Eternal form shall never renew my uncertain prevails against thee

20       Yet tho I rage God over all. A portion of my Life

That in Eternal fields in comfort wanderd with my flocks

At noon & laid her head upon my wearied bosom at night

She is divided She is vanishd even like Luvah & Vala

O why did foul ambition sieze thee Urizen Prince of Light

And thee O Luvah prince of Love till Tharmas was divided

And I what can I now behold but an Eternal Death

Before my Eyes & an Eternal weary work to strive

Against the monstrous forms that breed among my silent waves

Is this to be A God far rather would I be a Man

30       To know sweet Science & to do with simple companions

Sitting beneath a tent & viewing sheepfolds & soft pastures

Take thou the hammer of Urthona rebuild these furnaces

Dost thou refuse mind I the sparks that issue from thy hair

PAGE 52

I will compell thee to rebuild by these my furious waves

Death choose or life thou strugglest in my waters, now choose life

And all the Elements shall serve thee to their soothing flutes

Their sweet inspiriting lyres thy labours shall administer

And they to thee only remit not faint not thou my son

Now thou dost know what tis to strive against the God of waters

So saying Tharmas on his furious chariots of the Deep

Departed far into the Unknown & left a wondrous void

Round Los. afar his waters bore on all sides round. with noise

10       Of wheels & horses hoofs & Trumpets Horns & Clarions

Terrified Los beheld the ruins of Urizen beneath

A horrible Chaos to his eyes. a formless unmeasurable Death

Whirling up broken rocks on high into the dismal air

And fluctuating all beneath in Eddies of molten fluid

Then Los with terrible hands siezd on the Ruind Furnaces

Of Urizen. Enormous work: he builded them anew

Labour of Ages in the Darkness & the war of Tharmas

And Los formd Anvils of Iron petrific. for his blows

Petrify with incessant beating many a rock. many a planet

20       But Urizen slept in a stoned stupor in the nether Abyss

A dreamful horrible State in tossings on his icy bed

Freezing to solid all beneath, his grey oblivious form

Stretchd over the immense heaves in strong shudders. silent his voice

In brooding contemplation stretching out from North to South

In mighty power. Round him Los rolld furious

His thunderous wheels from furnace to furnace. tending diligent

The contemplative terror. frightend in his scornful sphere

Frightend with cold infectious madness. in his hand the thundering

Hammer of Urthona. forming under his heavy hand the hours

PAGE 53

The days & years. in chains of iron round the limbs of Urizen

Linkd hour to hour & day to night & night to day & year to year

In periods of pulsative furor. mills he formd & works

Of many wheels resistless in the power of dark Urthona

But Enitharmon wrapd in clouds waild loud. for as Los beat

The anvils of Urthona link by link the chains of sorrow

Warping upon the winds & whirling round in the dark deep

Lashd on the limbs of Enitharmon & the sulphur fires

Belchd from the furnaces wreathd round her. chaind in ceaseless fire

10       The lovely female howld & Urizen beneath deep groand

Deadly between the hammers beating grateful to the Ears

Of Los. absorbd in dire revenge he drank with joy the cries

Of Enitharmon & the groans of Urizen fuel for his wrath

And for his pity secret feeding on thoughts of cruelty

The Spectre wept at his dire labours when from Ladles huge

He pourd the molten iron round the limbs of Enitharmon

But when he pourd it round the bones of Urizen he laughd

Hollow upon the hollow wind. his shadowy form obeying

The voice of Los compelld he labourd round the Furnaces

20       And thus began the binding of Urizen day & night in fear

Circling round the dark Demon with howlings dismay & sharp blightings

The Prophet of Eternity beat on his iron links & links of brass

And as he beat round the hurtling Demon. terrified at the Shapes

Enslavd humanity put on he became what he beheld

Raging against Tharmas his God & uttering

Ambiguous words blasphemous filld with envy firm resolvd

On hate Eternal in his vast disdain he labourd beating

The Links of fate link after link an endless chain of sorrows

PAGE 54

The Eternal Mind bounded began to roll eddies of wrath ceaseless

Round & round & the sulphureous foam surgeing thick

Settled a Lake bright & shining clear. White as the snow

Forgetfulness dumbness necessity in chains of the mind lockd up

In fetters of ice shrinking. disorganizd rent from Eternity

Los beat on his fetters & \[*pourd*\] heated his furnaces

And pourd iron sodor & sodor of brass

Restless the immortal inchaind heaving dolorous

Anguished unbearable till a roof shaggy wild inclosd

10       In an orb his fountain of thought

In a horrible dreamful slumber like the linked chain

A vast spine writhd in torment upon the wind

Shooting paind. ribbs like a bending Cavern

And bones of solidness froze over all his nerves of joy

A first age passed. a State of dismal woe

From the Caverns of his jointed spine down sunk with fright

A red round globe. hot burning. deep deep down into the Abyss

Panting Conglobing trembling Shooting out ten thousand branches

Around his solid bones & a Second age passed over

20       In harrowing fear rolling his nervous brain shot branches

\[*Round the branches of his heart*\]

On high into two little orbs hiding in two little caves

Hiding carefully from the wind his eyes beheld the deep

And a third age passed a State of dismal woe

The pangs of hope began in heavy pain striving struggling

Two Ears in close volutions from beneath his orbs of vision

Shot spiring out & petrified as they grew. And a Fourth

Age passed over & a State of dismal woe

In ghastly torment sick hanging upon the wind

Two nostrils bent down to the deeps –

PAGE 55 \(FIRST PORTION\)

And a fifth age passed & a state of dismal woe

In ghastly torment sick. within his ribs bloated round

A craving hungry cavern. Thence arose his channeld

Throat. then like a red flame a tongue of hunger

And thirst appeard and a sixth age passed of dismal woe

Enraged & stifled with torment he threw his right arm to the north

His left arm to the south shooting out in anguish deep

And his feet stamped the nether abyss in trembling howling & dismay

And a seventh age passed over & a state of dismal woe

10       The Council of God on high watching over the Body

Of Man clothd in Luvahs robes of blood saw & wept

Descending over Beulahs mild moon coverd regions

The daughters of Beulah saw the Divine Vision they were comforted

And as a Double female form loveliness & perfection of beauty

They bowd the head & worshippd & with mild voice spoke these words

PAGE 56

Lord. Saviour if thou hadst been here our brother had not died

And now we know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God

He will give it thee for we are weak women & dare not lift

Our eyes to the Divine pavilions. therefore in mercy thou

Appearest clothd in Luvahs garments that we may behold thee

And live. Behold Eternal Death is in Beulah Behold

We perish & shall not be found unless thou grant a place

In which we may be hidden under the Shadow of wings

For if we who are but for a time & who pass away in winter

10       Behold these wonders of Eternity we shall consume

Such were the words of Beulah of the Feminine Emanation

The Empyrean groand throughout All Eden was darkend

The Corse of \[*Man*\] Albion lay on the Rock the sea of Time & Space

Beat round the Rock in mighty waves & as a Polypus

That vegetates beneath the Sea the limbs of Man vegetated

In monstrous forms of Death a Human polypus of Death

The Saviour mild & gentle bent over the corse of Death

Saying If ye will Believe your Brother shall rise again

And first he found the Limit of Opacity & namd it Satan

20       In Albions bosom for in every human bosom these limits stand

And next he found the Limit of Contraction & namd it Adam

While yet those beings were not born nor knew of good or Evil

Then wondrously the \[*Deep beneath*\] Starry Wheels felt the divine hand. Limit

Was put to Eternal Death Los felt the Limit & saw

The Finger of God touch the Seventh furnace in terror

And Los beheld the hand of God over his furnaces

Beneath the Deeps in dismal Darkness beneath immensity

PAGE 55 \(SECOND PORTION\)

In terrors Los shrunk from his task. his great hammer

Fell from his hand his fires hid their strong limbs in smoke

For with noises ruinous hurtlings & clashings & groans

The immortal endur’d. tho bound in a deadly sleep

Pale terror siezd the Eyes of Los as he beat round

The hurtling Demon. terrifid at the shapes

Enslavd humanity put on he became what he beheld

He became what he was doing he was himself transformd

*Bring in here the Globe of Blood as in the B of Urizen*

10       Spasms siezd his muscular fibres writhing to & fro his pallid lips

Unwilling movd as Urizen howld his loins wavd like the sea

At Enitharmons shrieks his knees each other smote & then he lookd

With stony Eyes on Urizen & then swift writhd his neck

Involuntary to the Couch where Enitharmon lay

The bones of Urizen hurtle on the wind the bones of Los

Twinge & his iron sinews bend like lead & fold

Into unusual forms dancing & howling stamping the Abyss

\[*BOOK*\] NIGHT THE FIFTH

Infected Mad he dancd on his mountains high & dark as heaven

Now fixd into one stedfast bulk his features stonify

From his mouth curses & from his eyes sparks of blighting

Beside the anvil cold he dancd with the hammer of Urthona

Terrific pale. Enitharmon stretchd on the \[*dismal*\] dreary Earth

Felt her immortal limbs freeze stiffning pale inflexible

His feet shr\[u\]nk withring from the deep shrinking & withering

And Enitharmon shrunk up all their fibres withring beneath

As plants witherd by winter leaves & stems & roots decaying

Melt into thin air while the seed drivn by the furious wind

Rests on the distant Mountains top. So Los & Enitharmon

Shrunk into fixed space stood trembling on a Rocky cliff

Yet mighty bulk & majesty & beauty remaind but unexpansive

As far as highest Zenith from the lowest Nadir. so far shrunk

Los from the furnaces a Space immense & left the cold

Prince of Light bound in chains of intellect among the furnaces

But all the furnaces were out & the bellows had ceast to blow

He stood trembling & Enitharmon clung around his knees

Their senses unexpansive in one stedfast bulk remain

20       The night blew cold & Enitharmon shriekd on the dismal wind

PAGE 58

Her pale hands cling around her husband & over her weak head

Shadows of Eternal Death sit in the leaden air

But the soft pipe the flute the viol organ harp & cymbal

And the sweet sound of silver voices calm the weary couch

Of Enitharmon but her groans drown the immortal harps

Loud & more loud the living music floats upon the air

Faint & more faint the daylight wanes. The wheels of turning darkness

Began in solemn revolutions. Earth convulsd with rending pangs

10       Rockd to & fro & cried sore at the groans of Enitharmon

still the faint harps & silver voices calm the weary couch

But from the caves of deepest night ascending in clouds of mist

The winter spread his wide black wings across from pole to pole

Grim frost beneath & terrible snow linkd in a marriage chain

Began a dismal dance. The winds around on pointed rocks

Settled like bats innumerable ready to fly abroad

The groans of Enitharmon shake the skies the labring Earth

Till from her heart rending his way a terrible Child sprang forth

In thunder smoke & sullen flames & howlings & fury & blood

Soon as his burning Eyes were opend on the Abyss

20     The horrid trumpets of the deep bellowd with bitter blasts

The Enormous Demons woke & howld around the \[*youthful*\] new born king

Crying Luvah King of Love thou art the King of rage & death

Urizen cast deep darkness round him raging Luvah pourd

The spears of Urizen from Chariots round the Eternal tent

Discord began then yells & cries shook the wide firma\[m\]ent

PAGE 59

Where is Sweet Vala gloomy prophet where the lovely form

That drew the body of Man from heaven into this dark Abyss

Soft tears & sighs where are you come forth shout on bloody fields

Shew thy soul Vala shew thy bow & quiver of secret fires

Draw thy bow Vala from the depths of hell thy black bow draw

And twang the bow string to our howlings let thine arrows black

Sing in the Sky as once they sang upon the hills of Light

When dark Urthona wept in torment of the secret pain

He wept & he divided & he laid his gloomy head

10       Down on the Rock of Eternity on darkness of the deep

Torn by black storms & ceaseless torrents of consuming fire

Within his breast his fiery sons chaind down & filld with cursings

And breathing terrible blood & vengeance gnashing his teeth with pain

Let loose the Enormous Spirit in the darkness of the deep

And his dark wife that once fair crystal form divinely clear

Within his ribs producing serpents whose souls are flames of fire

But now the times return upon thee Enitharmons womb

Now holds thee soon to issue forth. Sound Clarions of war

Call Vala from her close recess in all her dark deceit

20     Then rage on rage shall fierce redound out of her crystal quiver

So sung the Demons \[*of the deep*\] round red Orc & round faint Enitharmon

Sweat & blood stood on the limbs of Los in globes. his fiery Eyelids

Faded. he rouzd he siezd the wonder in his hands & went

Shuddring & weeping thro the Gloom & down into the deeps

Enitharmon nursd her fiery child in the dark deeps

Sitting in darkness. over her Los mournd in anguish fierce

Coverd with gloom. the fiery boy grew fed by the milk

Of Enitharmon. Los around her builded pillars of iron

PAGE 60

And brass & silver & gold fourfold in dark prophetic fear

For now he feard Eternal Death & uttermost Extinction

He builded Golgonooza on the Lake of Udan Adan

Upon the Limit of Translucence then he builded Luban

Tharmas laid the Foundations & Los finishd it in howling woe

But when fourteen summers & winters had revolved over

Their solemn habitation Los beheld the ruddy boy

Embracing his bright mother & beheld malignant fires

In his young eyes discerning plain that Orc plotted his death

10       Grief rose upon his ruddy brows. a tightening girdle grew

Around his bosom like a bloody cord. in secret sobs

He burst it, but next morn another girdle succeeds

Around his bosom. Every day he viewd the fiery youth

With silent fear & his immortal cheeks grew deadly pale

Till many a morn & many a night passd over in dire woe

Forming a girdle in the day & bursting it at night

The girdle was formd by day by night was burst in twain

Falling down on the rock an iron chain link by link lockd

Enitharmon beheld the bloody chain of nights & days

20     Depending from the bosom of Los & how with \[*dismal*\] griding pain

He went each morning to his labours with the spectre dark

Calld it the chain of Jealousy. Now Los began to speak

His woes aloud to Enitharmon. since he could not hide

His uncouth plague. He siezd the boy in his immortal hands

While Enitharmon followd him weeping in dismal woe

Up to the iron mountains top & there the Jealous chain

Fell from his bosom on the mountain. The Spectre dark

Held the fierce boy Los naild him down binding around his limbs

The \[*dismal*\] accursed chain O how bright Enitharmon howld & cried

30     Over her son. Obdurate Los bound down her loved Joy

PAGE 61

The hammer of Urthona smote the rivets in terror. of brass

Tenfold. the Demons rage flamd tenfold forth rending

Roaring redounding. Loud Loud Louder & Louder & fird

The darkness warring with the waves of Tharmas & Snows of Urizen

Crackling the flames went up with fury from the immortal demon

Surrounded with flames the Demon grew loud howling in his fires

Los folded Enitharmon in a cold white cloud in fear

Then led her down into the deeps & into his labyrinth

Giving the Spectre sternest charge over the howling fiend

10     Concenterd into Love of Parent Storgous Appetite Craving

His limbs bound down mock at his chains for over them a flame

Of circling fire unceasing plays to feed them with life & bring

The virtues of the Eternal worlds ten thousand thousand spirits

Of life \[*rejoice*\] lament around the Demon going forth & returning

At his enormous call they flee into the heavens of heavens

And back return with wine & food. Or dive into the deeps

To bring the thrilling joys of sense to quell his ceaseless rage

His eyes the lights of his large soul contract or else expand

Contracted they behold the secrets of the infinite mountains

20     The veins of gold & silver & the hidden things of Vala

Whatever grows from its pure bud or breathes a fragrant soul

Expanded they behold the terrors of the Sun & Moon

The Elemental Planets & the orbs of eccentric fire

His nostrils breathe \[*with*\] a fiery flame. his locks are like the forests

Of wild beasts there the lion glares the tyger & wolf howl there

And there the Eagle hides her young in cliffs & precipices

His bosom is like starry heaven expanded all the stars

Sing round. there waves the harvest & the vintage rejoices. the Springs

Flow into rivers of delight. there the spontaneous flowers

30     Drink laugh & sing. the grasshopper the Emmet & the Fly

The golden Moth builds there a house & spreads her silken bed

PAGE 62

His loins inwove with silken fires are like a furnace fierce

As the strong Bull in summer time when bees sing round the heath

Where the herds low after the shadow & after the water spring

The numrous flocks cover the mountain & shine along the valley

His knees are rocks of adamant & rubie & emerald

Spirits of strength in Palaces rejoice in golden armour

Armed with spear & shield they drink & rejoice over the slain

Such is the Demon such his terror in the nether deep

         But when returnd to Golgonooza Los & Enitharmon

10      Felt all the sorrow Parents feel. they wept toward one another

And Los repented that he had chaind Orc upon the mountain

And Enitharmons tears prevaild parental love returnd

Tho terrible his dread of that infernal chain They rose

At midnight hasting to their much beloved care

Nine days they traveld thro the Gloom of Entuthon Benithon

Los taking Enitharmon by the hand led her along

The dismal vales & up to the iron mountains top where Orc

Howld in the furious wind he thought to give to Enitharmon

Her son in tenfold joy & to compensate for her tears

20     Even if his own death resulted so much pity him paind

         But when they came to the dark rock & to the spectrous cave

Lo the young limbs had strucken root into the rock & strong

Fibres had from the Chain of Jealousy inwove themselves

In a swift vegetation round the rock & round the Cave

And over the immortal limbs of the terrible fiery boy

In vain they strove now to unchain. In vain with bitter tears

To melt the chain of Jealousy. not Enitharmons death

Nor the Consummation of Los could ever melt the chain

Nor unroot the infernal fibres from their rocky bed

30      Nor all Urthonas strength nor all the power of Luvahs Bulls

Tho they each morning drag the unwilling Sun out of the deep

Could uproot the infernal chain. for it had taken root

PAGE 63

Into the iron rock & grew a chain beneath the Earth

Even to the Center wrapping round the Center & the limbs

Of Orc entering with fibres. became one with him a living Chain

Sustained by the Demons life. Despair & Terror & Woe & Rage

Inwrap the Parents in cold clouds as they bend howling over

The terrible boy till fainting by his side the Parents fell

         Not long they lay Urthonas spectre found herbs of the pit

Rubbing their temples he reviv’d them. all their lamentations

I write not here but all their after life was lamentation

10     When satiated with grief they returnd back to Golgonooza

Enitharmon on the road of Dranthon felt the inmost gate

Of her bright heart burst open & again close with a \[*dismal*\] deadly pain

Within her heart Vala began to reanimate in bursting sobs

And when the Gate was open she beheld that \[*dismal*\] dreary Deep

Where bright Ahania wept. She also saw the infernal roots

Of the chain of Jealousy & felt the rendings of fierce howling Orc

         Rending the Caverns like a mighty wind pent in the Earth

Tho wide apart as furthest north is from the furthest south

Urizen trembled where he lay to hear the howling terror

20     The rocks shook the Eternal bars tuggd to & fro were rifted

Outstretchd upon the stones of ice the ruins of his throne

Urizen shuddring heard his trembling limbs shook the strong caves

         The Woes of Urizen shut up in the deep dens of Urthona

         Ah how shall Urizen the King submit to this dark mansion

Ah how is this\! Once on the heights I stretchd my throne sublime

The mountains of Urizen once of silver where the sons of wisdom dwelt

And on whose tops the Virgins sang are rocks of Desolation

         My fountains once the haunt of Swans now breed the scaly tortoise

The houses of my harpers are become a haunt of crows

30     The gardens of wisdom are become a field of horrid graves

And on the bones I drop my tears & water them in vain

         PAGE 64

Once how I walked from my palace in gardens of delight

The sons of wisdom stood around the harpers followd with harps

Nine virgins clothd in light composd the song to their immortal voices

And at my banquets of new wine my head was crownd with joy

         Then in my ivory pavilions I slumberd \[*with*\] in the noon

And walked in the silent night among sweet smelling flowers

Till on my silver bed I slept & sweet dreams round me hoverd

But now my land is darkend & my wise men are departed

         My songs are turned into cries of Lamentation

10     Heard on my Mountains & deep sighs under my palace roofs

Because the Steeds of Urizen once swifter than the light

Were kept back from my Lord & from his chariot of mercies

O did I keep the horses of the day in silver pastures

O I refusd the Lord of day the horses of his prince

O did I close my treasuries with roofs of solid stone

And darken all my Palace walls with envryings & hate

O Fool to think that I could hide from his all piercing eyes

The gold & silver & costly stones his holy workmanship

O Fool could I forget the light that filled my bright spheres

20     Was a reflection of his face who calld me from the deep

I well remember for I heard the mild & holy voice

Saying O light spring up & shine & I sprang up from the deep

He gave to me a silver scepter & crownd me with a golden crown

\[*Saying*\] & said Go forth & guide my Son who wanders on the ocean

I went not forth. I hid myself in black clouds of my wrath

I calld the stars around my feet in the night of councils dark

The stars threw down their spears & fled naked away

We fell. I siezd thee dark Urthona In my left hand falling

I siezd thee beauteous Luvah thou art faded like a flower

30     And like a lilly is thy wife Vala witherd by winds

When thou didst bear the golden cup at the immortal tables

Thy children smote their fiery wings crownd with the gold of heaven

         PAGE 65

Thy pure feet stepd on the steps divine. too pure for other feet

And thy fair locks shadowd thine eyes from the divine effulgence

Then thou didst keep with Strong Urthona the living gates of heaven

But now thou art bound down with him even to the gates of hell

         Because thou gavest Urizen the wine of the Almighty

For steeds of Light that they might run in thy golden chariot of pride

I gave to thee the Steeds I pourd the stolen wine

And drunken with the immortal draught fell from my throne sublime

         I will arise Explore these dens & find that deep pulsation

10     That shakes my caverns with strong shudders. perhaps this is the night

Of Prophecy & Luvah hath burst his way from Enitharmon

When Thought is closd in Caves. Then love shall shew its root in deepest Hell

End of the Fifth \[*Book*\] Night

         PAGE 67

         VALA

NIGHT THE SIXTH

         So Urizen arose & leaning on his Spear explord his dens

He threw his flight thro the dark air to where a river flowd

And taking off his silver helmet filled it & drank

But when unsatiated his thirst he assayd to gather more

Lo three terrific women at the verge of the bright flood

Who would not suffer him to approach. but drove him back with storms

         Urizen knew them not & thus addressd the spirits of darkness

         Who art thou Eldest Woman sitting in thy clouds

What is that name written on thy forehead? what art thou?

10     And wherefore dost thou pour this water forth in sighs & care

         She answerd not but filld her urn & pourd it forth abroad

         Answerest thou not said Urizen. then thou maist answer me

Thou terrible woman clad in blue whose strong attractive power

Draws all into a fountain at the rock of thy attraction

With frowning brow thou sittest mistress of these mighty waters

         She answerd not but stretchd her arms & threw her limbs abroad

         Or wilt thou answer youngest Woman clad in shining green

With labour & care thou dost divide the \[*river*\] current into four

Queen of these dreadful rivers speak & let me hear thy voice

         PAGE 68

\[*but*\] They reard up a wall of rocks \[*then*\] and Urizen raisd his spear.

They gave a scream, they knew their father Urizen knew his daughters

They shrunk into their channels. dry the rocky strand beneath his feet

Hiding themselves in rocky forms from the Eyes of Urizen

         Then Urizen wept & thus his lamentation poured forth

         O horrible O dreadful state\! those whom I loved best

On whom I pourd the beauties of my light adorning them

With jewels & precious ornament labourd with art divine

Vests of the radiant colours of heaven & crowns of golden fire

10     I gave sweet lillies to their breasts & roses to their hair

I taught them songs of sweet delight. I gave their tender voices

Into the blue expanse & I invented with laborious art

Sweet instruments of sound. in pride encompassing my Knees

They pourd their radiance above all. the daughters of Luvah Envied

At their exceeding brightness & the sons of eternity sent them gifts

Now will I pour my fury on them & I will reverse

The precious benediction. for their colours of loveliness

I will give blackness for jewels hoary frost for ornament deformity

For crowns wreathd Serpents for sweet odors stinking corruptibility

20     For voices of delight hoarse croakings inarticulate thro frost

For labourd fatherly care & sweet instruction. I will give

Chains of dark ignorance & cords of twisted self conceit

And whips of stern repentance & food of stubborn obstinacy

That they may curse Tharmas their God & Los his adopted son

That they may curse & worship the obscure Demon of destruction

That they may worship terrors & obey the violent

Go forth sons of my curse Go forth daughters of my abhorrence

         Tharmas heard the deadly scream across his watry world

And Urizens loud sounding voice lamenting on the wind

30     And he came riding in his fury. froze to solid were his waves

PAGE 69

Silent in ridges he beheld them stand round Urizen

A dreary waste of solid waters for the King of Light

Darkend his brows with his cold helmet & his gloomy spear

Darkend before him. Silent on the ridgy waves he took

His gloomy way before him Tharmas fled & flying fought

         Crying. What & who art thou Cold Demon. art thou Urizen

Art thou like me risen again from death or art thou deathless

If thou art he my desperate purpose hear & give me death

For death to me is better far than life. death my desire

10     That I in vain in various paths have sought but still I live

The Body of Man is given to me I seek in vain to destroy

For still it surges forth in fish & monsters of the deeps

And in these monstrous forms I Live in an Eternal woe

And thou O Urizen art falln never to be deliverd

Withhold thy light from me for ever & I will withhold

From thee thy food so shall we cease to be & all our sorrows

\[*Cease*\] End & the Eternal Man no more renew beneath our power

If thou refusest in eternal flight thy beams in vain

Shall pursue Tharmas & in vain shalt crave for food I will

20     Pour down my flight thro dark immensity Eternal falling

Thou shalt pursue me but in vain till starvd upon the void

Thou hangst a dried skin shrunk up weak wailing in the wind

         So Tharmas spoke but Urizen replied not. On his way

He took. high bounding over hills & desarts floods & horrible chasms

Infinite was his labour without end his travel he strove

In vain for hideous monsters of the deeps annoyd him sore

Scaled & finnd with iron & brass they devourd the path before him

Incessant was the conflict. On he bent his weary steps

Making a path toward the dark world of Urthona. he rose

30     With pain upon the \[*dismal*\] dreary mountains & with pain descended

And saw their grizly fears & his eyes sickend at the sight

         The howlings gnashings groanings shriekings shudderings sobbings burstings

Mingle together to create a world for Los. In cruel delight

PAGE 70 \(FIRST PORTION\)

Los brooded on the darkness nor saw Urizen with a Globe of fire

Lighting his dismal journey thro the pathless world of death

Writing in bitter tears & groans in books of iron & brass

The enormous wonders of the Abysses once his brightest joy

For Urizen beheld the terrors of the Abyss wandring among

The ruind spirits once his children & the children of Luvah

Scard at the sound of their own sigh that seems to shake the immense

They wander Moping in their heart a Sun a Dreary moon

A Universe of fiery constellations in their brain

10     An Earth of wintry woe beneath their feet & round their loins

Waters or winds or clouds or brooding lightnings & pestilential plagues

Beyond the bounds of their own self their senses cannot penetrate

As the tree knows not what is outside of its leaves & bark

And yet it drinks the summer joy & fears the winter sorrow

So in the regions of the grave none knows his dark compeer

Tho he partakes of his dire woes & mutual returns the pang

The throb the dolor the convulsion in soul sickening woes

         \[*Not so closd up the Prince of Light now darkend wandring among*

*For Urizen beheld the terrors of the Abyss wandring among*

20     *The Ruind Spirits once his Children & the Children of Luvah*\]

         The horrid shapes & sights of torment in burning dungeons & in

Fetters of red hot iron some with crowns of serpents & some

With monsters girding round their bosoms. Some lying on beds of sulphur

On racks & wheels he beheld women marching oer burning wastes

Of Sand in bands of hundreds & of fifties & of thousands strucken with

Lightnings which blazed after them upon their shoulders in their march

In successive vollies with loud thunders swift flew the King of Light

Over the burning desarts     Then the desarts passd. involvd in clouds

Of smoke with myriads moping in the stifling vapours. Swift

30     Flew the King tho flagd his powers labring. till over rocks

And Mountains faint weary he wanderd. where multitudes were shut

Up in the solid mountains & in rocks which heaved with their torments

Then came he among fiery cities & castles built of burning steel

Then he beheld the forms of tygers & of Lions dishumanizd men

Many in serpents & in worms stretchd out enormous length

Over the sullen mould & slimy tracks obstruct his way

Drawn out from deep to deep woven by ribbd

And scaled monsters or armd in iron shell or shell of brass

Or gold a glittering torment shining & hissing in eternal pain

40     Some \[*as*\] columns of fire or of water sometimes stretchd out in \[*length*\] heighth

Sometimes in \[*breadth*\] length sometimes englobing wandering in vain seeking for ease

His voice to them was but an inarticulate thunder for their Ears

Were heavy & dull & their eyes & nostrils closed up

Oft he stood by a howling victim Questioning in words

Soothing or Furious no one answerd every one wrapd up

In his own sorrow howld regardless of his words, nor voice

Of sweet response could he obtain tho oft assayd with tears

He knew they were his Children ruind in his ruind world

PAGE 71 \(FIRST PORTION\)

Oft would he stand & question a fierce scorpion glowing with gold

In vain the terror heard not. then a lion he would Sieze

By the fierce mane staying \[*their*\] his howling course in vain the voice

Of Urizen in vain the Eloquent tongue. A Rock a Cloud a Mountain

Were now not Vocal as in Climes of happy Eternity

Where the lamb replies to the infant voice & the lion to the man of years

Giving them sweet instructions Where the Cloud the River & the Field

Talk with the husbandman & shepherd. But these attackd him sore

Siezing upon his feet & rending the Sinews that in Caves

10     He hid to recure his obstructed powers with rest & oblivion

         PAGE 70 \(SECOND PORTION\)

Here he had time enough to repent of his rashly threatend curse

He saw them cursd beyond his Curse his soul melted with fear

PAGE 71 \(SECOND PORTION\)

He could not take their fetters off for they grew from the soul

Nor could he quench the fires for they flamd out from the heart

Nor could he calm the Elements because himself was Subject

So he threw his flight in terror & pain & in repentant tears

         When he had passd these southern terrors he approachd the East

Void pathless beaten with \[*eternal*\] iron sleet & eternal hail & \[*snow*\] rain

No form was there no living thing & yet his way lay thro

This dismal world. he stood a while & lookd back oer his former

Terrific voyage. Hills & Vales of torment & despair

20     Sighing & wiping a fresh tear. then turning round he threw

Himself into the dismal void, falling he fell & fell

Whirling in unresistible revolutions down & down

In the horrid bottomless vacuity falling falling falling

Into the Eastern vacuity the empty world of Luvah

         The ever pitying one who seeth all things saw his fall

And in the dark vacuity created a bosom of \[*slime*\] clay

When wearied dead he fell his limbs reposd in the bosom of slime

As the seed falls from the sowers hand so Urizen fell & death

Shut up his powers in oblivion. then as the seed shoots forth

30     In pain & sorrow. So the slimy bed his limbs renewd

At first an infant weakness. periods passd he gatherd strength

But still in solitude he sat then rising threw his flight

Onward tho falling thro the waste of night & ending in death

And in another resurrection to sorrow & weary travel

But still his books he bore in his strong hands & his iron pen

For when he died they lay beside his grave & when he rose

He siezd them with a \[*dismal*\] gloomy smile for wrapd in his death clothes

He hid them when he slept in death when he revivd the clothes

Were rotted by the winds the books remaind still unconsumd

40     Still to be written & interleavd with brass & iron & gold

Time after time for such a journey none but iron pens

Can write And adamantine leaves recieve nor can the man who goes

PAGE 72

The journey obstinate refuse to write time after time

         Endless had been his travel but the Divine hand him led

For infinite the distance & obscurd by Combustions dire

By rocky masses frowning in the abysses revolving erratic

Round Lakes of fire in the dark deep the ruins of Urizens world

Oft would he sit in a dark rift & regulate his books

Or sleep such sleep as spirits eternal wearied in his dark

Tearful & sorrowful state. then rise look out & ponder

His dismal voyage eyeing the next sphere tho far remote

10     Then darting into the Abyss of night his venturous limbs

Thro lightnings thunders earthquakes & concussions fires & floods

Stemming his downward fall labouring up against futurity

Creating many a Vortex fixing many a Science in the deep

And thence throwing his venturous limbs into the Vast unknown

Swift swift from Chaos to chaos from void to void a road immense

         For when he came to where a Vortex ceasd to operate

Nor down nor up remaind then if he turnd & lookd back

From whence he came twas upward all. & if he turnd and viewd

The unpassd void upward was still his mighty wandring

20     The midst between an Equilibrium grey of air serene

Where he might live in peace & where his life might meet repose

         But Urizen said Can I not leave this world of Cumbrous wheels

Circle oer Circle nor on high attain a void

Where self sustaining I may view all things beneath my feet

Or sinking thro these Elemental wonders swift to fall

I thought perhaps to find an End a world beneath of voidness

Whence I might travel round the outside of this Dark confusion

When I bend downward bending my head downward into the deep

Tis upward all which way soever I my course begin

30     But when A Vortex formd on high by labour & sorrow & care

And weariness begins on all my limbs then sleep revives

My wearied spirits waking then tis downward all which way

So ever I my spirits turn no end I find of all

O what a world is here unlike those climes of bliss

Where my sons gatherd round my knees O thou poor ruind world

Thou horrible ruin once like me thou wast all glorious

And now like me partaking desolate thy masters lot

Art thou O ruin the once glorious heaven are these thy rocks

Where joy sang in the trees & pleasure sported on the rivers

PAGE 73

And laughter sat beneath the Oaks & innocence sported round

Upon the green plains & sweet friendship met in palaces

And books & instruments of song & pictures of delight

Where are they whelmd beneath these ruins in horrible \[*confusion*\] destruction

And if Eternal falling I repose on the dark bosom

Of winds & waters or thence fall into a Void where air

Is not down falling thro immensity ever & ever

I lose my powers weakend every revolution till a death

Shuts up my powers then a seed in the vast womb of darkness

10     I dwell in dim oblivion. brooding over me the Enormous worlds

Reorganize me shooting forth in bones & flesh & blood

I am regenerated to fall or rise at will or to remain

A labourer of ages a dire discontent a living woe

Wandring in vain. Here will I fix my foot & here rebuild

Here Mountains of Brass promise much riches in their dreadful \[*bowels*\] bosoms

         So \[*saying*\] he began to form/dig of gold silver & \[*brass*\] iron

And brass vast instruments to measure out the immense & fix

The whole into another world better suited to obey

His will where none should dare oppose his will himself being King

20     Of All & all futurity be bound in his vast chain

         And the Sciences were fixd & the Vortexes began to operate

On all the suns of men & every human soul terrified

At the turning wheels of heaven shrunk away inward withring away

Gaining a New Dominion over all his Sons & Daughters

& over the sons & daughters of Luvah in the horrible Abyss

For Urizen lamented over them in a selfish lamentation

Till a white woof coverd his cold limbs from head to \[*foot*\] feet

Hair white as snow coverd him in flaky locks terrific

Overspreading his limbs. in pride he wanderd weeping

30     Clothed in aged venerableness obstinately resolvd

Travelling thro darkness & whereever he traveld a dire Web

Followd behind him as the Web of a Spider dusky & cold

Shivering across from Vortex to Vortex drawn out from his mantle of years

A living Mantle adjoind to his life & growing from his Soul

         And the Web of Urizen stre\[t\]chd direful shivring in clouds

And uttering such woes such \[*burstings*\] bursts such thunderings

The eyelids expansive as morning & the Ears

As a golden ascent winding round to the heavens of heavens

Within the dark horrors of the Abysses lion or tyger or scorpion

         PAGE 74

For every one opend within into Eternity at will

But they refusd because their outward forms were in the Abyss

And the wing like tent of the Universe beautiful surrounding all

Or drawn up or let down at the will of the immortal man

Vibrated in such anguish the eyelids quiverd

Weak & Weaker their expansive orbs began shrinking

Pangs smote thro the brain & a universal shriek

Ran thro the Abysses rending the web torment on torment

         Thus Urizen in sorrows wanderd many a dreary way

10     Warring with monsters of the Deeps in his most hideous pilgrimage

Till his bright hair scatterd in snows his skin barkd oer with wrinkles

Four Caverns rooting downwards their foundations thrusting forth

The metal rock & stone in ever painful throes of vegetation

The Cave of Orc stood to the South a furnace of dire flames

Quenchless unceasing. In the west the Cave of Urizen

For Urizen fell as the Midday sun falls down into the West

North stood Urthonas stedfast throne a World of Solid darkness

Shut up in stifling obstruction rooted in dumb despair

The East was Void. But Tharmas rolld his billows in ceaseless eddies

20     Void pathless beat with Snows eternal & iron hail & rain

All thro the caverns of fire & air & Earth. Seeking

For Enions limbs nought finding but the black sea weed & sickning slime

Flying away from Urizen that he might not give him food

Above beneath on all sides round in the vast deep of immensity

That he might starve the sons & daughters of Urizen on the winds

Making between horrible chasms into the vast unknown

All these around the world of Los cast forth their monstrous births

But in Eternal times the Seat of Urizen is in the South

Urthona in the North Luvah in East Tharmas in West

30     And now he came into the Abhorred world of Dark Urthona

By Providence divine conducted not bent from his own will

Lest death Eternal should be the result for the Will cannot be violated

Into the doleful vales where no tree grew nor river flowd

Nor man nor beast nor creeping thing nor sun nor cloud nor star

Still he with his globe of fire immense in his venturous hand

Bore on thro the Affrighted vales ascending & descending

Oerwearied or in cumbrous flight he venturd oer dark rifts

Or down dark precipices or climbd with pain and labour huge

Till he beheld the world of Los from the Peaked rock of Urthona

40     And heard the howling of red Orc distincter & distincter

         PAGE 75

Redoubling his immortal efforts thro the narrow vales

With difficulty down descending guided by his Ear

And \[*with*\] by his globe of fire he went down the Vale of Urthona

Between the enormous iron walls built by the Spectre dark

Dark grew his globe reddning with mists & full before his path

Striding across the narrow vale the \[*Shade*\] Shadow of Urthona

A spectre Vast appeard whose feet & legs with iron scaled

Stampd the hard rocks expectant of the unknown wanderer

Whom he had seen wandring his nether world when distant far

And watchd his swift approach collected dark the Spectre stood

Beside hi\[m\] Tharmas stayd his flight & stood in stern defiance

Communing with the Spectre who rejoicd along the vale

Round his loins a girdle glowd with many colourd fires

In his hand a knotted Club whose knots like mountains frownd

Desart among the Stars them withering with its ridges cold

Black scales of iron arm the dread visage iron spikes instead

Of hair shoot from his orbed scull, his glowing eyes

Burn like two furnaces, he calld with Voice of Thunder

         Four winged heralds mount the furious blasts & blow their trumps

20     Gold Silver Brass & iron clangors clamoring rend the \[*deeps*\] shores

Like white clouds rising from the Vales his fifty two armies

From the four Cliffs of Urthona rise glowing around the Spectre

Four sons of Urizen the Squadrons of Urthona led in arms

Of gold & silver brass & iron he knew his mighty sons

         Then Urizen arose upon the wind back many a mile

Retiring into his dire Web scattering fleecy snows

As he ascended howling loud the Web vibrated strong

From heaven to heaven from globe to globe. In vast excentric paths

Compulsive rolld the Comets at his dread command the dreary way

30     Falling with wheel impetuous down among Urthonas vales

And round red Orc returning back to Urizen gorgd with blood

Slow roll the massy Globes at his command & slow oerwheel

The dismal squadrons of Urthona. weaving the dire Web

In their progressions & preparing Urizens path before him

End of The Sixth Night

         PAGE 77

         VALA

         NIGHT THE SEVENTH \[a\]

         Then Urizen arose The Spectre fled & Tharmas fled

The darkening Spectre of Urthona hid beneath a rock

Tharmas threw his impetuous flight thro the deeps of immensity

Revolving round in whirlpools fierce all round the cavernd worlds

         But Urizen silent descended to the Caves of Orc & saw

A Cavernd Universe of flaming fire the horses of Urizen

Here bound to fiery mangers furious dash their golden hoofs

Striking fierce sparkles from their brazen fetters, fierce his lions

Howl in the burning dens his tygers roam in the redounding smoke

10     In forests of affliction, the adamantine scales of justice

Consuming in the raging lamps of mercy pourd in rivers

The holy oil rages thro all the cavernd rocks fierce flames

Dance on the rivers & the rocks howling & drunk with fury

The plow of ages & the golden harrow wade thro fields

Of goary blood the immortal seed is nourishd for the slaughter

The bulls of Luvah breathing fire bellow on burning pastures

Round howling Orc whose awful limbs cast forth red smoke & fire

That Urizen approachd not near but took his seat on a rock

And rangd his books around him brooding Envious over Orc

20      Howling & rending his dark caves the awful Demon lay

Pulse after pulse beat on his fetters pulse after pulse his spirit

Darted & darted higher & higher to the shrine of Enitharmon

As when the thunder folds himself in thickest clouds

The watry nations couch & hide in the profoundest deeps

Then bursting from his troubled head with terrible visages & flaming hair

His swift wingd daughters sweep across the vast black ocean

         Los felt the Envy in his limbs like to a blighted tree

PAGE 78

For Urizen fixd in Envy sat brooding & coverd with snow

His book of iron on his knees he tracd the dreadful letters

While his snows fell & his storms beat to cool the flames of Orc

Age after Age till underneath his heel a deadly root

Struck thro the rock the root of Mystery accursed shooting up

Branches into the heaven of Los they pipe formd bending down

Take root again whereever they touch again branching forth

In intricate labyrinths oerspreading many a grizly deep

         Amazd started Urizen when he found himself compassd round

10     And high roofed over with trees. he arose but the stems

Stood so thick he with difficulty & great pain brought

His books out of the dismal shade. all but the book of iron

Again he took his seat & rangd his Books around

On a rock of iron frowning over the foaming fires of Orc

         And Urizen hung over Orc & viewd his terrible wrath

Sitting upon \[*his*\] an iron Crag at length his words broke forth

         Image of dread whence art thou whence is this most woful place

Whence these fierce fires but from thyself No other living thing

In all this Chasm I behold. No other living thing

20     Dare thy most terrible wrath abide Bound here to waste in pain

Thy vital substance in these fires that issue new & new

Around thee sometimes like a flood & sometimes like a rock

Of living pangs thy horrible bed glowing with ceaseless fires

Beneath thee & around Above a Shower of fire now beats

Moulded to globes & arrowy wedges rending thy bleeding limbs

And now a whirling pillar of burning sands to overwhelm thee

Steeping thy wounds in salts infernal & in bitter anguish

And now a rock moves on the surface of this lake of fire

To bear thee down beneath the waves in stifling despair

30     Pity for thee movd me to break my dark & long repose

And to reveal myself before thee in a form of wisdom

Yet thou dost laugh at all these tortures & this horrible place

Yet throw thy limbs these fires abroad that back return upon thee

While thou reposest throwing rage on rage feeding thyself

With visions of sweet bliss far other than this burning clime

Sure thou art bathd in rivers of delight on verdant fields

Walking in joy in bright Expanses sleeping on bright clouds

With visions of delight so lovely that they urge thy rage

Tenfold with fierce desire to rend thy chain & howl in fury

40     And dim oblivion of all woe & desperate repose

Or is thy joy founded on torment which others bear for thee

         Orc answerd curse thy hoary brows. What dost thou in this deep

Thy Pity I contemn scatter thy snows elsewhere

PAGE 79

I rage in the deep for Lo my feet & hands are naild to the burning rock

Yet my fierce fires are better than thy snows    Shuddring thou sittest

Thou art not chaind Why shouldst thou sit cold grovelling demon of woe

In tortures of dire coldness now a Lake of waters deep

Sweeps over thee freezing to solid still thou sitst closd up

In that transparent rock as if in joy of thy bright prison

Till overburdend with its own weight drawn out thro immensity

With a crash breaking across the horrible mass comes down

Thundring & hail & frozen iron haild from the Element

10     Rends thy white hair yet thou dost fixd obdurate brooding sit

Writing thy books. Anon a cloud filld with a waste of snows

Covers thee still obdurate still resolvd & writing still

Tho rocks roll oer thee tho floods pour tho winds black as the Sea

Cut thee in gashes tho the blood pours down around thy ankles

Freezing thy feet to the hard rock still thy pen obdurate

Traces the wonders of Futurity in horrible fear of the future

I rage furious in the deep for lo my feet & hands are naild

To the hard rock or thou shouldst feel my enmity & hate

In all the diseases of man falling upon thy grey accursed front

20     Urizen answerd Read my books explore my Constellations

Enquire of my Sons & they shall teach thee how to War

Enquire of my Daughters who accursd in the dark depths

Knead bread of Sorrow by my stern command for I am God

Of all this dreadful ruin Rise O daughters at my Stern command

Rending the Rocks Eleth & Uveth rose & Ona rose

Terrific with their iron vessels driving them across

In the dim air they took the book of iron & placd above

On clouds of death & sang their songs kneading the bread of Orc

Orc listend to the song compelld hungring on the cold wind

30     That swaggd heavy with the accursed dough. the hoar frost ragd

Thro Onas sieve    the torrent rain pourd from the iron pail

Of Eleth & the icy hands of Uveth kneaded the bread

The heavens bow with terror underneath their iron hands

Singing at their dire work the words of Urizens book of iron

While the enormous scrolls rolld dreadful in the heavens above

And still the burden of their song in tears was poured forth

The bread is Kneaded let us rest O cruel father of children

But Urizen remitted not their labours upon his rock

PAGE 80

And Urizen Read in his book of brass in sounding tones

         Listen O Daughters to my voice Listen to the Words of Wisdom

So shall \[you\] govern over all let Moral Duty tune your tongue

But be your hearts harder than the nether millstone

To bring the shadow of Enitharmon beneath our wondrous tree

That Los may Evaporate like smoke & be no more

Draw down Enitharmon to the Spectre of Urthona

And let him have dominion over Los the terrible shade

Compell the poor to live upon a Crust of bread by soft mild arts

10     Smile when they frown frown when they smile & when a man looks pale

With labour & abstinence say he looks healthy & happy

And when his children sicken let them die there are enough

Born even too many & our Earth will be overrun

Without these arts    If you would make the poor live with temper

With pomp give every crust of bread you give with gracious cunning

Magnify small gifts reduce the man to want a gift & then give with pomp

Say he smiles if you hear him sigh If pale say he is ruddy

Preach temperance    say he is overgorgd & drowns his wit

In strong drink tho you know that bread & water are all

20     He can afford    Flatter his wife pity his children till we can

Reduce all to our will as spaniels are taught with art

Lo how the heart & brain are formed in the breeding womb

Of Enitharmon how it buds with life & forms the bones

The little heart the liver & the red blood in its labyrinths

By gratified desire by strong devouring appetite she fills

Los with ambitious fury that his race shall all devour

         Then Orc \[*answerd*\] cried Curse thy Cold hypocrisy. already round thy Tree

In scales that shine with gold & rubies thou beginnest to weaken

My divided Spirit Like a worm I rise in peace unbound

30     From wrath Now When I rage my fetters bind me more

O torment O torment A Worm compelld. Am I a worm

Is it in strong deceit that man is born. In strong deceit

Thou dost refrain my fury that the worm may fold the tree

Avaunt Cold hypocrite    I am chaind or thou couldst not use me thus

The Man shall rage bound with this Chain the worm in silence creep

Thou wilt not cease from rage Grey Demon silence all thy storms

Give me example of thy mildness King of furious hail storms

Art thou the cold attractive power that holds me in this chain

I well remember how I stole thy light & it became fire

40     Consuming. Thou Knowst me now O Urizen Prince of Light

And I know thee is this the triumph this the Godlike State

That lies beyond the bounds of Science in the Grey obscure

         Terrified Urizen heard Orc now certain that he was Luvah

And Orc \[*So saying*\] he began to Organize a Serpent body

Despising Urizens light & turning it into flaming fire

Recieving as a poisond Cup Recieves the heavenly wine

And turning \[*wisdom*\] affection into fury & thought into abstraction

A Self consuming dark devourer rising into the heavens

         Urizen envious brooding sat & saw the secret terror

50     Flame high in pride & laugh to scorn the source of his deceit

Nor knew the source of his own but thought himself the Sole author

PAGE 81

Of all his wandering Experiments in the horrible Abyss

He knew that weakness stretches out in breadth & length he knew

That wisdom reaches high & deep & therefore he made Orc

In Serpent form compelld stretch out & up the mysterious tree

He sufferd him to Climb that he might draw all human forms

Into submission to his will nor knew the dread result

         Los sat in showers of Urizen \[*cold*\] watching cold Enitharmon

His broodings rush down to his feet producing Eggs that hatching

Burst forth upon the winds above the tree of Mystery

10     Enitharmon lay on his knees. Urizen tracd his Verses

In the dark deep the dark tree grew. her shadow was drawn down

Down to the roots it wept over Orc. the Shadow of Enitharmon

         Los saw her stretchd the image of death upon his witherd valleys

Her Shadow went forth & returnd Now she was pale as snow

When the mountains & hills are coverd over & the paths of Men shut up

But when her spirit returnd as ruddy as a morning when

The ripe fruit blushes into joy in heavens eternal halls

\[*She Secret joyd to see She fed herself on his Despair*

*She said I am avengd for all my sufferings of old*\]

20     Sorrow shot thro him from his feet it shot up to his head

Like a cold night that nips the roots & shatters off the leaves

Silent he stood oer Enitharmon watching her pale face

He spoke not he was Silent till he felt the cold disease

Then Los mournd on the dismal wind in his jealous lamentation

         Why can I not Enjoy thy beauty Lovely Enitharmon

When I return from clouds of Grief in the wandring Elements

Where thou in thrilling joy in beaming summer loveliness

Delectable reposest ruddy in my absence flaming with beauty

Cold pale in sorrow at my approach trembling at my terrific

30     Forehead & eyes thy lips decay like roses in \[*early*\] the spring

How art thou Shrunk thy grapes that burst in summers vast Excess

Shut up in little purple covering faintly bud & die

Thy olive trees that pourd down oil upon a thousand hills

Sickly look forth & scarcely stretch their branches to the plain

Thy roses that expanded in the face of glowing morn

PAGE 82

Hid in a little silken veil scarce breathe & faintly shine

Thy lilies that gave light what time the morning looked forth

Hid in the Vales faintly lament & no one hears their voice

All things beside the woful Los enjoy the delights of beauty

Once how I sang & calld the beasts & birds to their delights

Nor knew that I alone exempted from the joys of love

Must war with secret monsters of the animating worlds

O that I had not seen the day then should I be at rest

Nor felt the stingings of desire nor longings after life

10     For life is Sweet to Los the wretched to his winged woes

Is given a craving cry that they may sit at night on barren rocks

And whet their beaks & snuff the air & watch the opening dawn

And Shriek till at the smells of blood they stretch their boney wings

And cut the winds like arrows shot by troops of Destiny

         Thus Los lamented in the night unheard by Enitharmon

For the Shadow of Enitharmon descended down the tree of Mystery

The Spectre saw the Shade Shivering over his gloomy rocks

Beneath the tree of Mystery which in the dismal Abyss

Began to blossom in fierce pain shooting its writhing buds

20     In throes of birth & now the blossoms falling shining fruit

Appeard of many colours & of various poisonous qualities

Of Plagues hidden in shining globes that grew on the living tree

         The Spectre of Urthona saw the Shadow of Enitharmon

Beneath the Tree of Mystery among the leaves & fruit

Reddning the Demon strong prepard the poison of sweet Love

He turnd from side to side in \[*vain*\] tears he wept & he embracd

The fleeting image & in whispers mild wood the faint shade

         Loveliest delight of Men. Enitharmon shady hiding

In secret places where no eye can trace thy watry way

30     Have I found thee have I found thee tremblest thou in fear

Because of Orc because he rent his discordant way

From thy sweet loins of bliss. red flowd thy blood

Pale grew thy face \[*thy/& his*\] lightnings playd around thee thunders hoverd

Over thee, & the terrible Orc rent his discordant way

But the next joy of thine shall be in sweet delusion

And its birth in fainting & sleep & \[*woe*\] Sweet delusions of Vala

The Shadow of Enitharmon answerd Art thou terrible Shade

Set over this sweet boy of mine to guard him lest he rend

PAGE 83

His mother to the winds of heaven Intoxicated with

The fruit of this delightful tree. I cannot flee away

From thy embrace else be assurd so horrible a form

Should never in my arms repose. now listen I will tell

Thee Secrets of Eternity which neer before unlockd

My golden lips nor took the bar from Enitharmons breast

Among the Flowers of Beulah walkd the Eternal Man & Saw

Vala the lilly of the desart. melting in high noon

Upon her bosom in sweet bliss he fainted    Wonder siezd

10     All heaven they saw him dark, they built a golden wall

Round Beulah There he reveld in delight among the Flowers

Vala was pregnant & brought forth Urizen Prince of Light

First born of Generation. Then behold a wonder to the Eyes

Of the now fallen Man a double form Vala appeard. A Male

And female shuddring pale the Fallen Man recoild

From the Enormity & calld them Luvah & Vala. turning down

The vales to find his way back into Heaven but found none

For his frail eyes were faded & his ears heavy & dull

         Urizen grew up in the plains of Beulah Many Sons

20     And many daughters flourishd round the holy Tent of Man

Till he forgot Eternity delighted in his sweet joy

Among his family his flocks & herds & tents & pastures

         But Luvah close conferrd with Urizen in darksom night

To bind the father & enslave the brethren Nought he knew

Of sweet Eternity the blood flowd round the holy tent & rivn

From its hinges uttering its final groan all Beulah fell

In dark confusion mean time Los was born & Enitharmon

But how I know not then forgetfulness quite wrapd me up

A period nor do I more remember till I stood

30     Beside Los in the Cavern dark enslavd to vegetative forms

According to the Will of Luvah who assumd the Place

Of the Eternal Man & smote him. But thou Spectre dark

Maist find a way to punish Vala in thy fiery South

To bring her down subjected to the rage of my fierce boy



              PAGE 84

The Spectre said. Thou lovely Vision this delightful Tree

Is given us for a Shelter from the tempests of Void & Solid

Till once again the morn of ages shall renew upon us

To reunite in those mild fields of happy Eternity

Where thou & I in undivided Essence walkd about

Imbodied. thou my garden of delight & I the spirit in the garden

Mutual there we dwelt in one anothers joy revolving

Days of Eternity with Tharmas mild & Luvah sweet melodious

Upon our waters. This thou well rememberest listen I will tell

10     What thou forgettest. They in us & we in them alternate Livd

Drinking the oys of Universal Manhood. One dread morn

Listen O vision of Delight One dread morn of goary blood

The manhood was divided for the gentle passions making way

Thro the infinite labyrinths of the heart & thro the nostrils issuing

In odorous stupefaction stood before the Eyes of Man

A female bright. I stood beside my anvil dark a mass

Of iron glowd bright prepard for spades & plowshares. sudden down

I sunk with cries of blood issuing downward in the veins

Which now my rivers were become rolling in tubelike forms

20     Shut up within themselves descending down I sunk along

The goary tide even to the place of seed & there dividing

I was divided in darkness & oblivion thou an infant woe

And I an infant terror in the womb of Enion

My masculine spirit scorning the frail body issud forth

From Enions brain In this deformed form leaving thee there

Till times passd over thee but still my spirit returning hoverd

And formd a Male to be a counterpart to thee O Love

Darkend & Lost In due time issuing forth from Enions womb

Thou & that demon Los wert born Ah jealousy & woe

30     Ah poor divided dark Urthona now a Spectre wandering

The deeps of Los the Slave of that Creation I created

I labour night & day for Los but listen thou my vision

I view futurity in thee I will bring down soft Vala

To the embraces of this terror & I will destroy

That body I created then shall we unite again in bliss

         Thou knowest that the Spectre is in Every Man insane brutish

Deformd that I am thus a ravening devouring lust continually

Craving & devouring but my Eyes are always upon thee O lovely

Delusion & I cannot crave for any thing but thee \[& *till*

40     *I have thee in my arms* & *am again united to Los*

*To be one body & One spirit with him*\] not so

The spectres of the Dead for I am as the Spectre of the Living

For till these terrors planted round the Gates of Eternal life

Are driven away & annihilated we never can repass the Gates

         PAGE 85

Astonishd filld with tears the spirit of Enitharmon beheld

And heard the Spectre bitterly she wept Embracing fervent

Her once lovd Lord now but a Shade herself also a shade

Conferring times on times among the branches of that Tree

         Thus they conferrd among the intoxicating fumes of Mystery

Till Enitharmons shadow pregnant in the deeps beneath

Brought forth a wonder horrible. While Enitharmon shriekd

And trembled thro the Worlds above Los wept his fierce soul was terrifid

At the shrieks of Enitharmon at her tossings nor could his eyes percieve

10     The cause of her dire anguish for she lay the image of Death

Movd by strong shudders till her shadow was deliverd then she ran

Raving about the upper Elements in maddning fury

She burst the Gates of Enitharmons heart with direful Crash

Nor could they ever be closd again the golden hinges were broken

And the gates \[*burst*\] broke in sunder & their ornaments defacd

Beneath the tree of Mystery for the immortal shadow shuddering

Brought forth this wonder horrible a Cloud she grew & grew

Till many of the dead burst forth from the bottoms of their tombs

In male forms without female counterparts or Emanations

20     Cruel and ravening with Enmity & Hatred & War

In dreams of Ulro \[*sweet*\] dark delusive drawn by the lovely shadow

The Spectre \[*smild*\] terrified gave her Charge over the howling Orc

Then took the tree of Mystery root in the World of Los

Its topmost \[*branches*\] boughs shooting a \[*stem*\] fibre beneath Enitharmons couch

The double rooted Labyrinth soon wavd around their heads

\[*End of the Seventh Night*\]

But then the Spectre enterd Los’s bosom Every sigh & groan

Of Enitharmon bore Urthonas Spectre on its wings

Obdurate Los felt Pity Enitharmon told the tale

Of Urthona. Los embracd the Spectre first as a brother

30     Then as another Self; astonishd humanizing & in tears

In Self abasement Giving up his Domineering lust

\[*The End of the Seventh Night*\]

Thou never canst embrace sweet Enitharmon terrible Demon. Till

Thou art united with thy Spectre Consummating by pains & labours

\[*Thy*\] That mortal body & by Self annihilation back returning

To Life Eternal be assurd I am thy real Self

Tho thus divided from thee & the Slave of Every passion

Of thy fierce Soul Unbar the Gates of Memory look upon me

Not as another but as thy real Self I am thy Spectre

Tho horrible & Ghastly to thine Eyes tho buried beneath

40     The ruins of the Universe. hear what inspird I speak & be silent

Thou didst subdue me in old times by thy Immortal Strength

When I was a ravning hungring & thirsting cruel lust & murder

If \[*once*\] we unite in one another better world will be

Opend within your heart & loins & wondrous brain

Threefold as it was in Eternity & this the fourth Universe

Will be Renewd by the three & consummated in Mental fires

But if thou dost refuse Another body will be prepared

PAGE 86

For me & thou annihilate evaporate & be no more

For thou art but a form & organ of life & of thyself

Art nothing being Created Continually by Mercy & Love divine

         Los furious answerd. Spectre horrible thy words astound my Ear

With irresistible conviction I feel I am not one of those

Who when convincd can still persist tho furious controllable

By Reasons power. Even I already feel a World within

Opening its gates & in it all the real substances

Of which these in the outward World are shadows which pass away

10     Come then into my Bosom & in thy shadowy arms bring with thee

My lovely Enitharmon. I will quell my fury & teach

Peace to the Soul of dark revenge & repentance to Cruelty

          So spoke Los & Embracing Enitharmon & the Spectre

Clouds would have folded round in Extacy & Love uniting

PAGE 87

But Enitharmon trembling fled & hid beneath Urizens tree

\[*Then*\] But mingling together with his Spectre the Spectre of Urthona

Wondering beheld the Center opend by Divine Mercy inspired

He in his turn Gave Tasks to Los Enormous to destroy

That body he created but in vain for Los performd

Wonders of labour

They Builded Golgonooza Los labouring \[*inspird*\] builded pillars high

And Domes terrific in the nether heavens for beneath

Was opend new heavens & a new Earth beneath & within

10       Threefold within the brain within the heart within the loins

A Threefold Atmosphere Sublime continuous from Urthonas world

But yet having a Limit Twofold named Satan & Adam

          But Los stood on the Limit of Translucence weeping & trembling

Filled with doubts in self accusation \[*gatherd*\] beheld the fruit

Of Urizens Mysterious tree For Enitharmon thus spake

          When In the Deeps beneath I gatherd of this ruddy fruit

It was by that I knew that I had Sinnd & then I knew

That without a ransom I could not be savd from Eternal death

That Life lives upon Death & by devouring appetite

20        All things subsist on one another thenceforth in despair

I spend my glowing time but thou art strong & mighty

To bear this Self conviction take then Eat thou also of

The fruit & give me proof of life Eternal or I die

          Then Los plucked the fruit & Eat & sat down in Despair

And must have given himself to death Eternal But

Urthonas spectre in part mingling with him comforted him

Being a medium between him & Enitharmon But This Union

Was not to be Effected without Cares & Sorrows & Troubles

          Of six thousand Years of self denial and \[*many Tears.*\] of bitter Contrition

30      Urthonas Spectre terrified beheld the Spectres of the Dead

Each Male formd without a counterpart without a concentering vision

The Spectre of Urthona wept before Los Saying I am the cause

That this dire state commences I began the dreadful state

Of Separation & on my dark head the curse & punishment

Must fall unless a way be found to Ransom & Redeem

But I have thee my \[*Counterpart/Vegetative*\] miraculous

These Spectres have no \[*Counterparts*\] therefore they ravin

Without the food of life Let us Create them Coun\[terparts\]

For without a Created body the Spectre is Eternal Death

40          Los trembling answerd Now I feel the weight of stern repentance

Tremble not so my Enitharmon at the awful gates

Of thy poor broken Heart I see thee like a shadow withering

As on the outside of Existence but look\! behold\! take comfort\!

Turn inwardly thine Eyes & there behold the Lamb of God

Clothed in Luvahs robes of blood descending to redeem

         O Spectre of Urthona take comfort O Enitharmon

Couldst thou but cease from terror & trembling & affright

When I appear before thee in forgiveness of\[*former injuries*\] ancient injuries

Why shouldst thou remember & be afraid. I surely have died in pain

50     Often enough to convince thy jealousy & fear & terror

Come hither be patient let us converse together because

I also tremble at myself & at all my former life

         Enitharmon answerd I behold the Lamb of God descending

To Meet these Spectres of the Dead I therefore fear that he

Will give us to Eternal Death fit punishment for such

Hideous offenders Uttermost extinction in eternal pain

An ever dying life of stifling & obstruction shut out

Of existence to be a sign of terror to all who behold

Lest any should in futurity do as we have done in heaven

60     Such is our state nor will the Son of God redeem us but destroy

         PAGE 90

So Enitharmon spoke trembling & in torrents of tears

         Los sat in Golgonooza in the Gate of Luban where

He had erected many porches \[*which*\] where branchd the Mysterious Tree

Where the Spectrous dead wail & sighing thus he spoke to Enitharmon

Lovely delight of Men Enitharmon \[*sweet*\] shady refuge from furious war

Thy bosom translucent is a soft repose for the weeping souls

Of those piteous victims of battle there they sleep in happy obscurity

They feed upon our life we are their victims. Stern desire

I feel to fabricate embodied semblances in which the dead

10     May live before us in our palaces & in our gardens of \[*pleasure*\] labour

Which now opend within the Center we behold spread abroad

To form a world of \[*life* & *love*\] Sacrifice of brothers & sons & daughters

To comfort Orc in his dire sufferings look my fires enlume afresh

Before my face ascending with delight as in ancient times

         Enitharmon spread her beaming locks upon the wind & said

O Lovely terrible Los wonder of Eternity O Los my defence & guide

Thy works are all my joy. & in thy fires my soul delights

If mild they burn in just proportion & in secret night

And silence build their day in shadow of soft clouds & dews

20     Then I can sigh forth on the winds of Golgonooza piteous forms

That vanish again into my bosom but if thou my Los

Wilt in sweet moderated fury, fabricate \[*sweet*\] forms sublime

Such as the piteous spectres may assimilate themselves into

They shall be ransoms for our Souls that we may live

So Enitharmon spoke & Los his hands divine inspired began

\[*To hew the cavernd rocks of Dranthon into forms of beauty*\]

To modulate his fires studious the loud roaring flames

He vanquishd with the strength of Art bending their iron points

And drawing them forth delighted upon the winds of Golgonooza

30     From out the ranks of Urizens war & from the fiery lake

Of Orc bending down as the binder of the Sheaves follows

The reaper in both arms embracing the furious raging flames

Los drew them forth out of the deeps planting his right foot firm

Upon the Iron crag of Urizen thence springing up aloft

Into the heavens of Enitharmon in a mighty circle

And first he drew a line upon the walls of shining heaven

And Enitharmon tincturd it with beams of blushing love

It remaind permanent a lovely form inspird divinely human

Dividing into just proportions Los unwearied labourd

40     The immortal lines upon the heavens till with sighs of love

Sweet Enitharmon mild Entrancd breathd forth upon the wind

The spectrous dead Weeping the Spectres viewd the immortal works

Of Los Assimilating to those forms Embodied & Lovely

In youth & beauty in the arms of Enitharmon mild reposing

         First Rintrah & then Palamabron drawn from out the ranks of war

In infant innocence reposd on Enitharmons bosom

Orc was comforted in the deeps his Soul revivd in them

As the Eldest brother is the \[*second*\] fathers image So Orc became

As Los a father to his brethren & he joyd in the dark lake

50     Tho bound with chains of Jealousy & in scales of iron & brass

But Los loved them & refusd to Sacrifice their infant limbs

And Enitharmons smiles & tears prevaild over self protection

They rather chose to meet Eternal death than to destroy

The offspring of their Care & Pity Urthonas spectre was comforted

But Tharmas most rejoicd in hope of Enions return

For he beheld new Female forms born forth upon the air

Who wove soft silken veils of covering in sweet rapturd trance

Mortal & not as Enitharmon without a covering veil

         First his immortal spirit drew Urizen\[s\] \[*Spectre*\] Shadow away

60     From out the ranks of war separating him in sunder

Leaving his Spectrous form which could not be drawn away

Then he divided Thiriel the Eldest of Urizens sons

Urizen became Rintrah Thiriel became Palamabron

Thus dividing the powers of Every Warrior

Startled was Los he found his Enemy Urizen now

In his hands. he wonderd that he felt love & not hate

His whole soul loved him he beheld him an infant

Lovely breathd from Enitharmon he trembled within himself

But in the deeps beneath the \[*tree*\] roots of Mystery in darkest night

Where Urizen sat on his rock the Shadow brooded \[*dismal*\]

Urizen saw & triumphd & he cried to \[*the Shadowy Female*\] his warriors

         The time of Prophecy is now revolvd & all

This Universal Ornament is mine & in my hands

20     The ends of heaven like a Garment will I fold them round me

Consuming what must be consumd then in power & majesty

I will walk forth thro those wide fields of endless Eternity

A God & not a Man a Conqueror in triumphant glory

And all the Sons of Everlasting shall bow down at my feet

         \[*The shadowy voice answerd O urizen Prince of Light*\]

First Trades & Commerce ships & armed vessels he builded laborious

To swim the deep & on the Land children are sold to trades

Of dire necessity still laboring day & night till all

Their life extinct they took the spectre form in dark despair

30     And slaves in myriads in ship loads burden the hoarse sounding deep

Rattling with clanking chains the Universal Empire groans

And he commanded his Sons found a Center in the Deep

And Urizen laid the first Stone & all his myriads

Builded a temple in the image of the human heart

PAGE 96

And in the inner part of the Temple wondrous workmanship

They formd the Secret place reversing all the order of delight

That whosoever enterd into the temple might not behold

The hidden wonders allegoric of the Generations

Of secret lust when hid in chambers dark the nightly harlot

Plays in Disguise in whisperd hymn & mumbling prayer The priests

He ordaind & Priestesses clothd in disguises beastial

Inspiring secrecy & lamps they bore intoxicating fumes

Roll round the Temple & they took the Sun that glowd oer Los

10       And with immense machines down rolling. the terrific orb

Compell’d. The Sun reddning like a fierce lion in his chains

Descended to the sound of instruments that drownd the noise

Of the hoarse wheels & the terrific howlings of wild beasts

That dragd the wheels of the Suns chariot & they put the Sun

Into the temple of Urizen to give light to the Abyss

To light the War by day to hide his secret beams by night

For he divided day & night in different orderd portions

The day for war the night for secret religion in his temple

\[*Urizen namd it Pande*\]

20       Los reard his mighty \[*forehead*\] stature on Earth stood his  
          feet. Above

The moon his furious forehead circled with black bursting thunders

His naked limbs glittring upon the dark blue sky his knees

Bathed in bloody clouds, his loins in fires of war where spears

And swords rage where the Eagles cry & the Vultures laugh saying

Now comes the night of Carnage now the flesh of Kings & Princes

Pamperd in palaces for our food the blood of Captains nurturd

With lust & murder for our drink the drunken Raven shall wander

All night among the slain & mock the wounded that groan in the field

Tharmas laughd. furious among the Banners clothd in blood

30       Crying As I will rend the Nations all asunder rending

The People, vain their combinations I will scatter them

But thou O Son whom I have crowned and inthrond thee Strong

I will preserve tho Enemies arise around thee numberless

I will command my winds & they shall scatter them or call

PAGE 97

My Waters like a flood around thee fear not trust in me

And I will give thee all the ends of heaven for thy possession

In war shalt thou bear rule in blood shalt thou triumph for me

Because in times of Everlasting I was rent in sunder

And what I loved best was divided among my Enemies

My little daughters were made captives & I saw them beaten

With whips along the sultry \[*roads*\] sands. I heard those whom I lovd

Crying in secret tents at night & in the morn compelld

To labour & behold my heart sunk down beneath

10       In sighs & sobbings all dividing till I was divided

In twain & lo my Crystal form that lived in my bosom

Followd her daughters to the fields of blood they left me naked

Alone & they refusd to return from the fields of the mighty

Therefore I will reward them as they have rewarded me

I will divide them in my anger & thou O my King

Shalt gather them from out their graves & put thy fetter on them

And bind them to thee that my crystal form may come to me

          So cried the Demon of the Waters in the Clouds of Los

Outstretchd upon the hills lay Enitharmon clouds & tempests

20       Beat round her head all night all day she riots in Excess

But \[*day by*\] night or day Los follows War & the dismal moon rolls over her

That when Los warrd upon the South reflected the fierce fires

Of his immortal head into the North upon faint Enitharmon

Red rage the furies of fierce Orc black thunders roll round Los

Flaming his head like the bright sun seen thro a mist that magnifies

His disk into a terrible vision to the Eyes of trembling mortals

And Enitharmon trembling & in fear utterd these words

          I put not any trust in thee nor in thy glittering scales

Thy eyelids are a terror to me & the flaming of thy crest

30       The rushing of thy Scales confound me thy hoarse rushing scales

And if that Los had not built me a tower upon a rock

I must have died in the dark desart among noxious worms

How shall I flee how shall I flee into the tower of Los

My feet are turned backward & my footsteps slide in clay

And clouds are closd around my tower my arms labour in vain

Does not the God of waters in the wracking Elements

Love those who hate rewarding with hate the Loving Soul

PAGE 98

And must not I obey the God thou Shadow of Jealousy

I cry the watchman heareth not I pour my voice in roarings

Watchman the night is thick & darkness cheats my rayie sight

Lift up Lift up O Los awake my watchman for he sleepeth

Lift up Lift up Shine forth O Light watchman thy light is out

O Los unless thou keep my tower the Watchman will be slain

          So Enitharmon cried upon her terrible Earthy bed

While the broad Oak wreathd his roots round her forcing his dark way

Thro caves of death into Existence The Beech long limbd advancd

10       Terrific into the paind heavens The fruit trees humanizing

Shewd their immortal energies in warlike desperation

Rending the heavens & earths & drinking blood in the hot battle

To feed their fruit to gratify their hidden sons & daughters

That far within the close recesses of their secret palaces

Viewd the vast war & joyd wishing to vegetate

Into the Worlds of Enitharmon Loud the roaring winds

Burdend with clouds howl round the Couch sullen the wooly sheep

Walks thro the battle Dark & fierce the Bull his rage

Propagates thro the warring Earth The Lion raging in flames

20       The Tyger in redounding smoke The Serpent of the woods

And of the waters & the scorpion of the desart irritate

With harsh songs every living soul. The Prester Serpent runs

Along the ranks crying Listen to the Priest of God ye warriors

This Cowl upon my head he placd in times of Everlasting

And said Go forth & guide my battles. like the jointed spine

Of Man I made thee when I blotted Man from life & light

Take thou the seven Diseases of Man store them for times to come

In store houses in secret places that I will tell the\[e\] of

To be my great & awful curses at the time appointed

     30      The Prester Serpent ceasd the War song sounded loud & strong

Thro all the heavens Urizens Web vibrated torment on torment

Then I heard the earthquake &c.

         PAGE 91 \(SECOND PORTION\)

Now in the Caverns of the Grave & Places of human seed

The nameless shadowy Vortex stood before the face of Orc

The Shadow reard her dismal head over the flaming youth

With sighs & howling & deep sobs that he might lose his rage

And with it lose himself in meekness she embracd his fire

As when the Earthquake rouzes from his den his shoulders huge

Appear above the crumb\[l\]ing Mountain. Silence waits around him

A moment then astounding horror belches from the Center

The fiery dogs arise the shoulders huge appear

10     So Orc rolld round his clouds upon the deeps of dark Urthona

Knowing the arts of Urizen were Pity & Meek \[*love*\] affection

And that by these arts the Serpent form exuded from his limbs

         Silent as despairing love & strong as Jealousy

Jealous that she was Vala now become Urizens harlot

And the Harlot of Los & the deluded harlot of the Kings of Earth

His soul was gnawn in sunder

The hairy shoulders rend the links free are the wrists of fire

Red rage redounds he rouzd his lions from his forests black

They howl around the flaming youth rending the nameless shadow

20     And running their immortal course thro solid darkness borne

         Loud Sounds the war song round red Orc in his \[*?triumphant*\] fury

And round the nameless shadowy Female in her howling terror

When all the Elemental Gods joind in the wondrous Song

         Sound the War trumpet terrific Souls clad in attractive steel

Sound the shrill fife serpents of war. I hear the northern drum

Awake, I hear the flappings of the folding banners

         The dragons of the North put on their armour

Upon the Eastern sea direct they take their course

The glittring of their horses trappings stains the vault of night

     30     Stop we the rising of the glorious King. spur spur your \[*steeds*\] clouds

PAGE 92

Of death O northern drum awake O hand of iron sound

The northern drum. Now give the charge\! bravely obscurd\!

With darts of wintry hail. Again the black bow draw

Again the Elemental Strings to your right breasts draw

And let the thundring drum speed on the arrows black

         The arrows flew from cloudy bow all day. till blood

From east to west flowd like the human veins in rivers

Of life upon the plains of death & valleys of despair

         Now sound the clarions of Victory now strip the slain

10     \[*Now*\] clothe yourselves in golden arms brothers of war

They sound the clarions strong they chain the howling captives

they give the Oath of blood They cast the lots into the helmet,

They vote the death of Luvah & they naild him to the tree

They piercd him with a spear & laid him in a sepulcher

To die a death of Six thousand years bound round with desolation

The sun was black & the moon rolld a useless globe thro heaven

         Then left the Sons of Urizen the plow & harrow the loom

The hammer & the Chisel & the rule & compasses

They forgd the sword the chariot of war the battle ax

20       The trumpet fitted to the battle & the flute of summer

And all the arts of life they changd into the arts of death

The hour glass contemnd because its simple workmanship

Was as the workmanship of the plowman & the water wheel

That raises water into Cisterns broken & burnd in fire

Because its workmanship was like the workmanship of the Shepherd

And in their stead intricate wheels invented Wheel without wheel

To perplex youth in their outgoings & to bind to labours

Of day & night the myriads of Eternity. that they might file

And polish brass & iron hour after hour laborious workmanship

30     Kept ignorant of the use that they might spend the days of wisdom

In sorrowful drudgery to obtain a scanty pittance of bread

In ignorance to view a small portion & think that All

And call it Demonstration blind to all the simple rules of life

         Now now the Battle rages round thy tender limbs O Vala

Now smile among thy bitter tears now put on all thy beauty

Is not the wound of the sword Sweet & the broken bone delightful

Wilt thou now smile among the slain when the wounded groan in the field

PAGE 93

Lift up thy blue eyes Vala & put on thy sapphire shoes

O Melancholy Magdalen behold the morning breaks

Gird on thy flaming Zone. descend into the Sepulcher

Scatter the blood from thy golden brow the tears from thy silver locks

Shake off the waters from thy wings & the dust from thy white garments

         Remember all thy feigned terrors on the secret Couch

When the sun rose in glowing morn with arms of mighty hosts

Marching to battle who was wont to rise with Urizens harps

Gift as a Sower with his seed to scatter life abroad

10     Arise O Vala bring the bow of Urizen bring the swift arrows of light

How ragd the golden horses of Urizen bound to the chariot of Love

Compelld to leave the plow to the Ox to snuff up the winds of desolation

To trample the corn fields in boastful neighings. this is no gentle harp

This is no warbling brook nor Shadow of a Myrtle tree

But blood & wounds & dismal cries & clarions of war

And hearts laid open to the light by the broad grizly sword

And bowels hidden \[*in darkness are*\] in hammerd steel rippd forth upon the ground

Call forth thy smiles of soft deceit call forth thy cloudy tears

We hear thy sighs in trumpets shrill when Morn shall blood renew

     20     So sung the demons of the deep the Clarions of war blew loud

Orc rent her & his human form consumd in his own fires

Mingled with her dolorous members strewn thro the Abyss

She joyd in all the Conflict Gratified & ?dropping tears of woe

No more remaind of Orc but the Serpent round the tree of Mystery

The form of Orc was gone he reard his serpent bulk among

The stars of Urizen in Power rending the form of life

Into a formless indefinite & strewing her on the Abyss

Like clouds upon the winter sky broken with winds & thunders

         This was to her Supreme delight The Warriors mournd disappointed

30     They go out to war with Strong Shouts & loud Clarions O Pity

They return with lamentations mourning & weeping

Invisible or visible drawn out in length or stretchd in breadth

The Shadowy Female Varied in the War in her delight

Howling in discontent black & heavy uttering brute sounds

Wading thro fens among the slimy weeds making Lamentations

To decieve Tharmas in his rage to soothe his furious soul

To stay him in his flight that Urizen might live tho in pain

He said Art thou bright Enion is the Shadow of hope returnd

         And She said Tharmas I am Vala bless thy innocent face

40     Doth Enion avoid the sight of thy blue watry eyes

Be not perswaded that the air knows this or the falling dew

Tharmas replid O Vala once I livd in a garden of delight

PAGE 94

I wakend Enion in the Morning & she turnd away

Among the apple trees & all the gardens of delight

Swam like a dream before my eyes I went to seek the steps

Of Enion in the gardens & the shadows compassd me

And closd me in a watry world of woe where Enion stood

Trembling before me like a shadow like a mist like air

And she is gone & here alone I war with darkness & death

I hear thy voice but not thy form see. thou & all delight

And life appear & vanish mocking me with shadows of false hope

10     Hast thou forgot that the air listens thro all its districts telling

The subtlest thoughts shut up from light in chambers of the Moon

         Tharmas. The Moon has chambers where the babes of love lie hid

And whence they never can be brought in all Eternity

Unless exposd by their vain parents. Lo him whom I love

Is hidden from me & I never in all Eternity

Shall see him Enitharmon & Ahania combind with Enion

Hid him in that Outrageous form of Orc which torments me for Sin

For all my Secret faults which he brings forth upon the light

Of day in jealousy & blood my Children are led to Urizens war

20     Before my eyes & for every one of these I am condemnd

To Eternal torment in these flames for tho I have the power

To rise on high Yet love here binds me down & never never

Will I arise till him I love is loosd from this dark chain

         Tharmas replied Vala thy Sins have lost us heaven & bliss

Thou art our Curse and till I can bring love into the light

I never will depart from my great wrath

         So Tharmas waild \[*then furious*\] wrathful then rode upon the Stormy Deep

Cursing the Voice that mockd him with false hope in furious mood

Then She returns swift as a blight upon the infant bud

30     Howling in all the notes of woe to stay his furious rage

Stamping the hills wading or swimming flying furious or falling

Or like an Earthquake rumbling in the bowels of the earth

Or like a cloud beneath & like a fire flaming on high

Walking in pleasure of the hills or murmuring in the dales

Like to a rushing torrent beneath & a falling rock above

A thunder cloud in the south & a lulling voice heard in the north

         And she went forth & saw the forms of life & of delight

Walking on Mountains or flying in the open expanse of heaven

She heard sweet voices in the winds & in the voices of birds

40     That rose from waters for the waters were as the voice of Luvah

Not seen to her like waters or like this dark world of death

Tho all those fair perfections which men know only by name

In beautiful substantial forms appeard & served her

As food or drink or ornament or in delightful works

To build her bowers for the Elements brought forth abundantly

The living soul in glorious forms & every one came forth

Walking before her Shadowy face & bowing at her feet

But in vain delights were poured forth on the howling melancholy

For her delight the horse his proud neck bowd & his white mane

50     And the Strong Lion deignd in his mouth to wear the golden bit

While the far beaming Peacock waited on the fragrant wind

To bring her fruits of sweet delight from trees of richest wonders

And the strong piniond Eagle bore the fire of heaven in the night season

Wood & subdud into Eternal Death the Demon Lay

In \[*anguish for*\] rage against the dark despair, the howling Melancholy

PAGE 95 \(FIRST PORTION\)

For far & wide she stretchd thro all the worlds of Urizens journey

And was Ajoind to Beulah as the Polypus to the Rock

Mo\[u\]rning the daughters of Beulah saw nor could they have sustaind

The horrid sight of death & torment    But the Eternal Promise

They wrote on all their tombs & pillars & on every Urn

These words    If ye will believe your B\[r\]other shall rise again

In golden letters ornamented with sweet labours of Love

Waiting with Patience \[*of*\] for the fulfilment of the Promise Divine

And all the Songs of Beulah sounded comfortable notes

10     Not suffring doubt to rise up from the Clouds of the Shadowy Female

Then myriads of the Dead burst thro the bottoms of their tombs

Descending on the shadowy females clouds in Spectrous terror

Beyond the Limit of Translucence on the Lake of Udan Adan

These they namd Satans & in the Aggregate they namd Them Satan

End of the Seventh Night \[b\]

         PAGE 99

         VALA

NIGHT THE EIGHTH

         Then All in Great Eternity \[*which is called*\] Met in the Council of God

\[*Met*\] as one Man Even Jesus upon Gilead & Hermon

Upon the Limit of Contraction to create the fallen Man

The \[*Eternal*\] Fallen Man stretchd like a Corse upon the oozy Rock

Washd with the tides Pale overgrown with weeds

That movd with horrible dreams hovring high over his head

Two winged immortal shapes one standing at his feet

Toward the East one standing at his head toward the west

Their wings joind in the Zenith over head \[*but other wings*

10     *They had which clothd their bodies like a garment of soft down*

*Silvery white shining upon the dark blue sky in silence*

*Their wings touchd the heavens their fair feet hoverd above*

*The swelling tides they bent over the dead corse like an arch*

*Pointed at top in highest heavens of precious stones & pearl*\]

         Such is a Vision of All Beulah hovring over the Sleeper

         The limit of Contraction now was fixd & Man began

To wake upon the Couch of Death he sneezed seven times

A tear of blood dropped from either eye again he reposd

In the saviours arms, in the arms of tender mercy & loving kindness

     20     Then \[*first*\] Los \[*beheld*\] said I behold the Divine Vision thro the broken Gates

Of \[*Enitharmons*\] thy poor broken heart astonishd melted into Compassion & Love

And Enitharmon \[*saw*\] said I see the Lamb of God upon Mount Zion

Wondring with love & Awe they felt the divine hand upon them

         For nothing could restrain the dead in Beulah from descending

Unto Ulros night tempted by the Shadowy females sweet

Delusive cruelty they descend away from the Daughters of Beulah

And Enter Urizens temple Enitharmon pitying & her heart

Gates broken down, they descend thro the Gate of Pity

The broken heart Gate of Enitharmon She sighs them forth upon the wind

30     Of Golgonooza Los stood recieving them

For Los could enter into Enitharmons bosom & explore

Its intricate Labyrinths now the Obdurate heart was broken

PAGE 100 \(FIRST PORTION\)

From out the War of Urizen & Tharmas recieving them

Into his hands. Then Enitharmon erected Looms in Lubans Gate

And calld the Looms Cathedron in these Looms She wove the Spectres

Bodies of Vegetation Singing lulling Cadences to drive away

Despair from the poor wandering spectres and Los loved them

With a parental love for the Divine hand was upon him

And upon Enitharmon & the Divine Countenance shone

In Golgonooza Looking down the Daughters of Beulah saw

With joy the bright Light & in it a Human form

10     And knew he was the Saviour Even Jesus & they worshipped

         \[*Astonishd Comforted Delighted the Daughters of Beulah saw*\]

Astonishd Comforted Delighted in notes of Rapturous Extacy

All Beulah stood astonishd Looking down to Eternal Death

They saw the Saviour beyond the Pit of death & destruction

For whether they lookd upward they saw the Divine Vision

Or whether they lookd downward still they saw the Divine Vision

Surrounding them on all sides beyond sin & death & hell

         Enitharmon wove in tears singing Songs of Lamentation

And pitying comfort as she sighd forth on the wind the Spectres

20     Also the Vegetated bodies which Enitharmon wove

Opend within their hearts & in their loins & in their brain

To Beulah & the Dead in Ulro descended from the War

Of Urizen & Tharmas & from the Shadowy females clouds

And some were woven \[*One fold*\] single & some two fold & some three fold

In Head or Heart or Reins according to the fittest order

Of most merciful pity & compassion to the Spectrous dead

         PAGE 101 \(FIRST PORTION\)

When Urizen saw the Lamb of God clothed in Luvahs robes

Perplexd & terrifid he Stood tho well he knew that Orc

Was Luvah But he now beheld a new Luvah. Or One

Who assumd Luvahs form & stood before him opposite

But he saw Orc a Serpent form augmenting times on times

In the fierce battle & he saw the Lamb of God & the World of Los

Surrounded by his dark machines for Orc augmented swift

In fury a Serpent wondrous among the Constellations of Urizen

A crest of fire rose on his forehead red as the carbuncle

10     Beneath down to his eyelids scales of pearl then gold & silver

Immingled with the ruby overspread his Visage down

His furious neck writ\[h\]ing contortive in dire budding pains

The scaly armour shot out. Stubborn down his back & bosom

The Emerald Onyx Sapphire jasper beryl amethyst

Strove in terrific emulation which should gain a place

\[*On the immortal fiend*\] Upon the mighty Fiend the fruit of the mysterious tree

Kneaded in Uveths kneading trough. Still Orc devourd the food

In raging hunger Still the pestilential food in gems & gold

Exuded round his awful limbs Stretching to serpent length

20     His human bulk While the dark shadowy female brooding over

Measurd his food morning & evening in cups & baskets of iron

With tears of sorrow incessant she labourd the food of Orc

Compelld by the iron hearted sisters Daughters of Urizen

Gathring the fruit of that mysterious tree circling its root

She spread herself thro all the branches in the power of Orc

         Thus Urizen in self deceit his warlike preparations fabricated

And when all things were finishd sudden wavd \[*his hurtling hand*\] among the Stars

\[*Among the stars*\] His hurtling hand gave the dire signal thunderous Clarions blow

And all the hollow deep rebellowd with the wonderous war

PAGE 100 \(SECOND PORTION\)

\[*But thus*\] But Urizen his mighty rage let loose in the mid deep

Sparkles of Dire affliction issud \[*from*\] round his frozen limbs

Horrible hooks & nets he formd twisting the cords of iron

30     And brass & molten metals cast in hollow globes & bor’d

Tubes in petrific steel & rammd combustibles & wheels

And chains & pullies fabricated all round the heavens of Los

Communing with the Serpent of Orc in dark dissimulation

And with the Synagogue of Satan in dark Sanhedrim

To undermine the World of Los & tear bright Enitharmon

PAGE 101 \(SECOND PORTION\)

30     To the four winds hopeless of future. All futurity

Seems teeming with Endless destruction never to be repelld

Desperate remorse swallows the present in a quenchless rage

         Terrified & astonishd Urizen beheld the battle take a form

Which he intended not a Shadowy \[*male*\] hermaphrodite black & opake

The Soldiers namd it Satan but he was yet unformd & vast

Hermaphroditic it at length became hiding the Male

Within as in a Tabernacle Abominable Deadly

         The battle howls the terrors fird rage in the work of death

Enormous Works Los Contemplated inspird by the holy Spirit

40     Los builds the Walls of Golgonooza against the stirring battle

That only thro the Gates of Death they can enter to Enitharmon

Raging they take the human visage & the human form

         Feeling the hand of Los in Golgonooza & the force

Attractive of his hammers beating & the Silver looms

Of Enitharmon singing lulling cadences on the wind

They humanize in the fierce battle where in direful pain

Troop by troop the beastial droves rend one another sounding loud

The instruments of sound & troop by troop in human forms they urge

PAGE 102

The dire confusion till the battle faints those that remain

Return in pangs & horrible convulsions to their beastial state

For the monsters of the Elements Lions or Tygers or Wolves

Sound loud the howling music Inspird by Los & Enitharmon Sounding loud terrific men

They seem to one another laughing terrible among the banners

And when the revolution of their day of battles over

Relapsing in dire torment they return to forms of woe

To moping visages returning inanimate tho furious

No more erect tho strong drawn out in length they ravin

10     For senseless gratification & their visages thrust forth

Flatten above & beneath & stretch out into beastial length

Weakend they stretch beyond their power in dire droves till war begins

Or Secret religion in their temples before secret shrines

         And Urizen gave life & sense by his immortal power

To all his Engines of deceit that linked chains might run

Thro ranks of war spontaneous & that hooks & boring screws

Might act according to their forms by innate cruelty

He formed also harsh instruments of sound

To grate the soul into destruction or to inflame with fury

20     The spirits of life to pervert all the faculties of sense

Into their own destruction if perhaps he might avert

His own despair even at the cost of every thing that breathes

         Thus in the temple of the Sun his books of iron & brass

And silver & gold he consecrated reading incessantly

To myriads of perturbed spirits thro the universe

They propagated the deadly words the Shadowy Female absorbing

The enormous Sciences of Urizen ages after ages exploring

The fell destruction. And she said O Urizen Prince of Light

What words of Dread pierce my faint Ear what fal\[l\]ing snows around

30     My feeble limbs infold my destind misery

I alone dare the lash abide to sit beneath the blast

Unhurt & dare the inclement forehead of the King of Light

From dark abysses of the times remote fated to be

PAGE 103

The sorrower of Eternity in love with tears Submiss I rear

My Eyes to thy Pavilions hear my prayer for Luvahs Sake

I see the murderer of my Luvah clothd in robes of blood

He who assumd my Luvahs throne in times of Everlasting

Where hast thou hid him whom I love in what remote Abyss

Resides that God of my delight O might my eyes behold

My Luvah then could I deliver all the sons of God

From Bondage of \[*the human form*\] these terrors & with influences sweet

As once in those eternal fields in brotherhood & Love

10     United we should live in bliss as those who sinned not

The Eternal Man is seald by thee never to be deliverd

We are all servants to thy will O King of Light relent

Thy furious power be our father & our loved King

But if my Luvah is no more If \[*that*\] thou hast smitten him

And laid him in the Sepulcher Or if \[*that*\] thou wilt revenge

His murder on another Silent I bow with dread

But happiness can never \[come\] to thee O King nor me

For he was source of every joy that this mysterious tree

Unfolds in Allegoric fruit. When shall the dead revive

20     Can that which has existed cease or can love & life Expire

         Urizen heard the Voice & saw the Shadow. underneath

His woven darkness & in laws & deceitful religions

Beginning at the tree of Mystery circling its root

She spread herself thro all the branches in the power of Orc

A shapeless & indefinite cloud in tears of sorrow incessant

Steeping the Direful Web of Religion swagging heavy it fell

From heaven to heaven thro all its meshes altering the Vortexes

Misplacing every Center hungry desire & lust began

Gathering the fruit of that Mysterious tree till Urizen

30     Sitting within his temple furious felt the num\[m\]ing stupor

Himself tangled in his own net in sorrow lust repentance

         Enitharmon wove in tears Singing Songs of Lamentations

And pitying comfort as she sighd forth on the wind the spectres

And wove them bodies calling them her belovd sons & daughters

Employing the daughters in her looms & Los employd the Sons

In Golgonoozas Furnaces among the Anvils of time & space

Thus forming a Vast family wondrous in beauty & love

And they appeard a Universal female form created

From those who were dead in Ulro from the Spectres of the dead

         PAGE 104 \(FIRST PORTION\)

And Enitharmon namd the Female Jerusa\[le\]m the holy

Wondring she saw the Lamb of God within Jerusalems Veil

The divine Vision seen within the inmost deep recess

Of fair Jerusalems bosom in a gently beaming fire

         Then sang the Sons of Eden round the Lamb of God & said

Glory Glory Glory to the holy Lamb of God

Who now beginneth to put off the dark Satanic body

Now we behold redemption Now we know that life Eternal

Depends alone upon the Universal hand & not in us

10     Is aught but death In individual weakness sorrow & pain

PAGE 113 \(FIRST PORTION\)

\[*Daughters of Beulah describe*\] We behold with wonder Enitharmons Looms & Los’s Forges

And the Spindles of Tirzah & Rahab and the Mills of Satan & Beelzeboul

In Golgonooza Los’s anvils stand & his Furnaces rage

\[*The hard dentant hammers are lulld by the flute lula lula The bellowing furnaces blare by the long sounding Clarion*\]

Ten thousand demons labour at the forges Creating Continually

The times & spaces of Mortal Life the Sun the Moon the Stars

In periods of Pulsative furor beating into \[*bars*\] wedges & bars

Then drawing into wires the terrific Passions & Affections

10     Of Spectrous dead. Thence to the Looms of Cathedron conveyd

The Daughters of Enitharmon weave the ovarium & the integument

In soft silk drawn from their own bowels in lascivious delight

With songs of sweetest cadence to the turning spindle & reel

Lulling the weeping spectres of the dead. Clothing their limbs

With gifts & gold of Eden. Astonishd stupified with delight

The terrors put on their sweet clothing on the banks of \[*the Moon*\] Arnon

Whence they plunge into the river of space for a period till

The dread Sleep of Ulro is past. But Satan \[*receives*\] Og & Sihon

Build Mills of resistless wheels to unwind the soft threads & reveal

20     Naked of their clothing the poor spectres before the accusing heavens

While Rahab & Tirzah far different mantles prepare webs of torture

Mantles of despair girdles of bitter compunction shoes of indolence

Veils of ignorance covering from head to feet with a cold web

         We look down into Ulro we behold the Wonders of the Grave

Eastward of Golgonooza stands the Lake of Udan Adan In

Entuthon Benithon \[*it is*\] a Lake not of Waters but of Spaces

Perturbd black & deadly on \[*the*\] its Islands & \[*the*\] its Margins \[*of this Lake*\]

The Mills of Satan and Beelzeboul stand round the roots of Urizens tree

For this Lake is formd from the tears & sighs & death sweat of the Victims

30     Of Urizens laws. to irrigate the roots of the tree of Mystery

They unweave the soft threads then they weave them anew in the forms

Of dark death & despair & none from Eternity to Eternity could Escape

But \[*All*\] thou O Universal Humanity who is One Man blessed for Ever

Recievest the Integuments woven Rahab beholds the Lamb of God

She smites with her knife of flint She destroys her own work

Times upon times thinking to destroy the Lamb blessed for Ever

He puts off the clothing of blood he redeems the spectres from their bonds

He awakes the sleepers in Ulro the Daughters of Beulah praise him

They anoint his feet with ointment they wipe them with the hair of their head

PAGE 104 \(SECOND PORTION\)

We now behold the Ends of Beulah & we now behold

Where Death Eternal is put off Eternally

Assume the dark Satanic body in the Virgins womb

O Lamb divin\[e\] it cannot thee annoy O pitying one

Thy pity is from the foundation of the World & thy Redemption

Begun Already in Eternity Come then O Lamb of God

Come Lord Jesus come quickly

So sang they in Eternity looking down into Beulah.

The war roard round Jerusalems Gates it took a hideous form

20     Seen in the aggregate a Vast Hermaphroditic form

\[*Heaving ? tw*\] Heavd like an Earthquake labring with convulsive groans

Intolerable at length an awful wonder burst

From the Hermaphroditic bosom Satan he was namd

Son of Perdition terrible his form dishumanizd monstrous

A male without a female counterpart a howling fiend

Fo\[r\]lorn of Eden & repugnant to the forms of life

Yet hiding the shadowy female Vala as in an ark & Curtains

Abhorrd accursed ever dying an Eternal death

Being multitudes of tyrant Men in union blasphemous

30     Against the divine image. Congregated Assemblies of wicked men

         Los said to Enitharmon Pitying I saw

Pitying the Lamb of God Descended thro Jerusalems gates

To put off Mystery time after time & as a Man

Is born on Earth so was he born of Fair Jerusalem

In mysterys woven mantle & in the Robes of Luvah

He stood in fair Jerusalem to awake up into Eden

The fallen Man but first to \[*rend the Veil of Mystery*\] Give his vegetated body

\[*And then call Urizen & Luvah & Tharmas & Urthona*\]

To be cut off & separated that the Spiritual body may be Reveald

         PAGE 105

The Lamb of God stood before \[*Urizen*\] Satan opposite

In Entuthon Benithon in the shadows of torments & woe

Upon the heights of \[*Entuthon that*\] Amalek taking refuge in his arms

The Victims fled from punishment \[*that*\] for all his words were peace

         \[*He*\] Urizen calld together the Synagogue of Satan in dire Sanhedrim

To Judge the Lamb of God to Death as a murderer & robber

As it is written he was numberd among the transgressors

         Cold dark opake the Assembly met twelvefold in Amalek

Twelve rocky unshapd forms terrific forms of torture & woe

10     Such seemd the Synagogue to distant view \[*around*\] amidst them \[*stood*\] beamd

A False Feminine Counterpart of Lovely Delusive Beauty

         Dividing & Uniting at will in the Cruelties of Holiness

Vala drawn down into a Vegetated body now triumphant

The Synagogue of Satan Clothed her with Scarlet robes & Gems

And on her forehead was her name written in blood Mystery

When viewd remote She is One when viewd near she divides

To multitude as it is in Eden so permitted because

It was the best possible in the State called Satan to Save

From Death Eternal & to put off Satan Eternally

20     The Synagogue Created her from Fruit of Urizens tree

By devilish arts abominable unlawful unutterable

Perpetually vegetating in detestable births

Of Female forms beautiful thro poisons hidden in secret

Which give a tincture to false beauty \[*therefore they were calld*

*The daughters* &\] there was hidden within

The bosom of Satan The false Female as in an ark & veil

Which christ must rend & her reveal Her Daughters are Calld

Tirzah She is namd Rahab their various divisions are \[*namd*\] calld

The Daughters of Amalek Canaan & Moab binding on the \[*Stems*\] Stones

Their victims & with \[*songs*\] knives tormenting them singing with tears

30     Over their victims Hear ye the song of the Females of Amalek

         O thou poor human form O thou poor child of woe

Why dost thou wander away from Tirzah why me compell to bind thee

If thou dost go away from me I shall consume upon the rocks

These fibres of thine eyes that used to wander in distant heavens

Away from me I have bound down with a hot iron

These nostrils that Expanded with delight in morning skies

I have bent downward with lead molten in my roaring furnaces

My soul is seven furnaces incessant roars the bellows

Upon my terribly flaming heart the molten metal runs

40     In channels thro my fiery limbs O love O pity O pain

O the pangs the bitter pangs of love forsaken

         Ephraim was a wilderness of joy where all my wild beasts ran

The river Kanah wanderd by my sweet Manassehs side

\[*To see the boy spring into heaven sounding from my sight*\]

Go Noah fetch the girdle of strong brass heat it red hot

Press it around the loins of this expanding cruelty

Shriek not so my only love

Bind him down Sisters bind him down on Ebal mount of Cursing

Malah come forth from Lebanon & Hoglah from Mount sinai

50     Come circumscribe this tongue of sweets & with a Screw of iron

Fasten this Ear into the Rock Milcah the task is thine

Weep not so sisters weep not so our life depends on this

Or mercy & truth are fled away from Shechem & Mount Gilead

Unless my beloved is bound upon the Stems of Vegetation

         Such are the songs of Tirzah such the loves of Amalek

The Lamb of God descended thro the twelve portions of Luvah

Bearing his sorrows & rec\[iev\]ing all his cruel wounds

         PAGE 106 \(FIRST PORTION\)

Thus was the Lamb of God condemnd to Death

They naild him upon the tree of Mystery weeping over him

And then mocking & then worshipping calling him Lord & King

Sometimes as twelve daughters lovely & sometimes as five

They stood in beaming beauty & sometimes as one even Rahab

\[*In which is Tirzah untranslucent an opake covering*\]

Who is Mystery Babylon the Great the Mother of Harlots

         \[*And Rahab stripd off Luvahs robes from off the lamb of God*

*Then first she saw his glory & her harlot form appeard*

10     *In all its turpitude beneath the divine light & of Luvahs robes*

*She made herself a Mantle*

*Also the Vegetated bodies which Enitharmon wove in her looms*

*Opend within the heart & in the loins & in the brain*

*To Beulah & the dead in Beulah descended thro their* gates

*And some were woven one fold some two fold & some threefold*

*In head or heart or reins according to the fittest order*

*Of most mournful pity*&*compassion to the spectrous dead*\]

           \[*She*\] Jerusalem saw the Body dead upon the Cross She fled away

Saying Is this Eternal Death Where shall I hide from Death

20     Pity me Los pity me Urizen & \[*build*\] let us build

A Sepulcher & worship Death in fear while yet we live

Death\! God of All from whom we rise to whom we all return

And Let all Nations \[*in*\] of the Earth worship at the Sepulcher

With Gifts & Spices with lamps rich embossd jewels & gold

           Los took the Body from the Cross Jerusalem weeping over

They bore it to the Sepulcher which Los had hewn in the rock

Of Eternity for himself he hewd it despairing of Life Eternal

PAGE 113 \(SECOND PORTION\)

40      \[*And*\] But when Rahab had cut off the Mantle of Luvah from

The Lamb of God it rolld apart, revealing to all in heaven

And all on Earth the Temple & the Synagogue of Satan & Mystery

Even Rahab in all her turpitude Rahab divided herself

She stood before Los in her Pride \[*above*\] among the Furnaces

Dividing & uniting in Delusive feminine pomp questioning him

He answerd her with tenderness & love not uninspird

Los sat upon his anvil stock they sat beside the forge

Los wipd the sweat from his red brow & thus began

To the delusive female forms shining among his furnaces

     50     I am that shadowy Prophet who six thousand years ago

Fell from my station in the Eternal bosom. I divided

To multitude & my multitudes are children of Care & Labour

O Rahab I behold thee I was once like thee a Son

Of Pride and I also have piercd the Lamb of God in pride & wrath

Hear me repeat my Generations that thou mayst also repent

But Satan accusd Palamabron before \[*Los*\] his brethren also he maddend

The horses of palambrons harrow wherefor Rintrah & Palamabron

Cut him off from Golgonooza. But Enitharmon in tears

Wept over him Created him a Space closd with a tender moon

And he rolld down beneath the fires of Orc a Globe immense

Crusted with snow in a dim void. here by the Arts of Urizen

He tempted many of the Sons & Daughters of Los to flee

Away from \[*Los*\] Me first Reuben fled then Simeon then Levi then Judah

20     Then Dan then Naphtali then Gad then Asher then Issachar

Then Zebulun then Joseph then Benjamin twelve sons of Los

And this is the manner in which Satan became the Tempter

         There is a State namd Satan learn distinct to know O \[*Mortals*\] Rahab

The Difference between States & Individuals of those States

The State namd Satan never can be redeemd in all Eternity

But when Luvah in Orc became a Serpent he des\[c\]ended into

That State calld Satan Enitharmon breathd forth on the Winds

Of Golgonooza her well beloved knowing he was Orc’s human remains

She tenderly lovd him above all his brethren he grew up

30     In mothers tenderness The Enormous worlds rolling in Urizens power

Must have given Satan by these mild arts Dominion over all

Wherefore \[*Rintrah* &\] Palamabron being accusd by Satan to Los

Calld down a Great Solemn assembly Rintrah in fury & fire

Defended Palamabron & rage filld the Universal Tent

Because Palamabron was good naturd Satan supposd he feard him

And Satan not having the Science of Wrath but only of Pity

Was soon condemnd & wrath was left to wrath & Pity to Pity

Rintrah & Palamabron Cut sheer off from Golgonooza

Enitharmons Moony space & in it Satan & his companions

40     They rolld down a dim world Crusted with Snow deadly &dark

         Jerusalem pitying them wove them mantles of life & death

Times after times And those in Eden sent Lucifer for their Guard

Lucifer refusd to die for Satan & in pride he forsook his charge

Then they sent Molech Molech was impatient They sent

Molech impatient They Sent Elohim who created Adam

To die for Satan Adam refusd but was compelled to die

By Satans arts. Then the Eternals Sent Shaddai

Shaddai was angry Pachad descended Pachad was terrified

And then they Sent Jehovah who leprous stretchd his hand to Eternity

50     Then Jesus Came & Died willing beneath Tirzah & Rahab

Thou art that Rahab Lo the Tomb what can we purpose more

PAGE 116

Lo Enitharmon terrible & beautiful in Eternal youth

Bow down before her you children & set Jerusalem free

Rahab burning with pride & revenge departed from Los

Los dropd a tear at her departure but he wipd it away in hope

She went to Urizen in pride the Prince of Light beheld

Reveald before the face of heaven his secret holiness

Darkness & sorrow coverd all flesh Eternity was darkend

         Urizen sitting in his web of dece\[i\]tful Religion \[*was? darkend*\]

30     \[He\] felt the female death a dull & numming stupor such as neer

Before assaulted the bright human form he felt his pores

Drink in the deadly dull delusion horrors of Eternal death

Shot thro him Urizen sat Stonied upon his rock

Forgetful of his own Laws pitying he began to Embrace

The Shadowy Female since life cannot be quenchd Life exuded

His eyes shot outwards then his breathing nostrils drawn forth

Scales coverd over a cold forehead & a neck outstretchd

Into the deep to sieze the shadow scales his neck & bosom

Coverd & scales his hands & feet upon his belly falling

40     Outstretchd \[*over*\] thro the immense his mouth wide opening tongueless

His teeth a triple row he strove to sieze the shadow in vain

And his immense tail lashd the Abyss his human form a Stone

A form of Senseless Stone remaind in terrors on the rock

Abominable to the eyes of mortals who explore his books

His wisdom still remaind & all his memory stord with woe

         And still his stony form remaind in the Abyss immense

Like the pale visage in its sheet of lead that cannot follow

Incessant stern disdain his scaly form gnaws inwardly

With deep repentance for the loss of that fair form of Man

50     With Envy he saw Los with Envy Tharmas & \[*Urthona*\] the Spectre

With Envy & in vain he swam around his stony form

         No longer now Erect the King of Light outstretchd in fury

Lashes his tail in the \[*wide*\] wild deep his Eyelids like the Sun

Arising in his pride enlighten all the Grizly deeps

His scales transparent give forth light like windows of the morning

His neck flames with wrath & majesty he lashes the Abyss

Beating the Desarts & the rocks the desarts feel his power

They shake their slumbers off. They wave in awful fear

Calling the Lion & the Tyger the horse & the wild Stag

PAGE 107

The Elephant the wolf the Bear the Lamia the Satyr

His Eyelids give their light around his folding tail aspires

Among the stars the Earth & all the Abysses feel h\[i\]s fury

When as the snow covers the mountains oft petrific hardness

Covers the deeps at his vast fury mo\[a\]ning in his rock

Hardens the Lion & the Bear trembling in the Solid mountain

They view the light & wonder crying out in terrible existence

Up bound the wild stag & the horse behold the King of Pride

         Oft doth his Eye emerge from the Abyss into the realms

10     Of his Eternal day & memory strives to augment his ruthfulness

Then weeping he descends in wrath drawing all things in his fury

Into obedience to his will & now he finds in vain

That not of his own power he bore the human form erect

Nor of his own will gave his Laws in times of Everlasting

For now fierce Orc in wrath & fury rises into the heavens

A King of wrath & fury a dark enraged horror

And Urizen repentant forgets his wisdom in the abyss

In forms of priesthood in the dark delusions of repentance

Repining in his heart & spirit that Orc reignd over all

20     And that his wisdom servd but to augment the indefinite lust

         Then Tharmas & Urthona felt the stony stupor rise

Into their limbs Urthona shot forth a Vast Fibrous form

Tharmas like a pillar of sand rolld round by the whirlwind

An animated Pillar rolling round & round in incessant rage

         Los felt the stony stupor & his head rolld down beneath

Into the Abysses of his bosom the vessels of his blood

Dart forth upon the wind in pipes writhing about in the Abyss

And Enitharmon pale & cold in milky juices flowd

Into a form of Vegetation living having a voice

30     Moving in rootlike fibres trembling in fear upon the Earth

And Tharmas gave his Power to Los Urthona gave his strength

Into the youthful prophet for the Love of Enitharmon

And of the nameless Shadowy female in the nether deep

And for the dread of the dark terrors of Orc & Urizen

         Thus in a living Death the nameless shadow all things bound

All mortal things made permanent that they may be put off

Time after time by the Divine Lamb who died for all

And all in him died. & he put off all mortality

         PAGE 108

Tharmas \[*above*\] on high rode furious thro the afflicted worlds

Pursuing the Vain Shadow of Hope fleeing from identity

In abstract false Expanses that he may not hear the Voice

Of Ahania wailing on the winds in vain he flies for still

The voice incessant calls on all the children of Men

For she spoke of all in heaven & all upon the Earth

Saw not as yet the Divine vision her Eyes are Toward Urizen

And thus Ahania cries aloud to the Caverns of the Grave

         Will you keep a flock of wolves & lead them will you take the wintry blast

10     For a covering to your limbs or the summer pestilence for a tent to abide in

Will you erect a lasting habitation in the mouldering Church yard

Or a pillar & palace of Eternity in the jaws of the hungry grave

Will you seek pleasure from the festering wound or marry for a Wife

The ancient Leprosy that the King & Priest may still feast on your decay

And the grave mock & laugh at the plowd field saying

         I am the nourisher thou the destroyer in my bosom is milk & wine

And a fountain from my breasts to me come all multitudes

To my breath they obey they worship me I am a goddess & queen

But listen to Ahania O ye sons of the Murderd one

20     Listen to her whose memory beholds your ancient days

Listen to her whose eyes behold the dark body of corruptible death

Looking for Urizen in vain. in vain I seek for morning

The Eternal Man sleeps in the Earth nor feels the vigrous sun

Nor silent moon nor all the hosts of heaven move in his body

His fiery halls are dark & round his limbs the Serpent Orc

Fold without fold encompasses him And his corrupting members

Vomit out the Scaly monsters of the restless deep

         They come up in the rivers & annoy the nether parts

Of Man who lays upon the shores leaning his faded head

30     Upon the Oozy rock inwrapped with the weeds of death

His eyes sink hollow in his head his flesh coverd with slime

And shrunk up to the bones alas that Man should come to this

His strong bones beat with snows & hid within the caves of night

Marrowless bloodless falling into dust driven by the winds

O how the horrors of Eternal Death take hold on Man

His faint groans shake the caves & issue thro the desolate rocks

PAGE 109

And the Strong Eagle now with num\[m\]ing cold blighted of feathers

Once like the pride of the sun now flagging in cold night

Hovers with blasted wings aloft watching with Eager Eye

Till Man shall leave a corruptible body he famishd hears him groan

And now he fixes his strong talons in the pointed rock

And now he beats the heavy air with his enormous wings

Beside him lies the Lion dead & in his belly worms

Feast on his death till universal death devours all

And the pale horse seeks for the pool to lie him down & die

10     But finds the pools filled with serpents devouring one another

He droops his head & trembling stands & his bright eyes decay

These are the Visions of My Eyes the Visions of Ahania

         Thus cries ahania Enion replies from the Caverns of the Grave

         Fear not O poor forsaken one O land of briars & thorns

Where once the Olive flourishd & the Cedar spread his wings

Once I waild desolate like thee my fallow fields in fear

Cried to the Churchyards & the Earthworm came in dismal state

I found him in my bosom & I said the time of Love

Appears upon the rocks & hills in silent shades but soon

20     A voice came in the night a midnight cry upon the mountains

Awake the bridegroom cometh I awoke to sleep no more

But an Eternal Consummation is dark Enion

The watry Grave. O thou Corn field O thou Vegetater happy

More happy is the dark consumer hope drowns all my torment

For I am now surrounded by a shadowy vortex drawing

The Spectre quite away from Enion that I die a death

Of better hope altho I consume in these raging waters

The furrowd field replies to the grave I hear her reply to me

Behold the time approaches fast that thou shalt be as a thing

30     Forgotten when one speaks of thee he will not be believd

When the man gently fades away in his immortality

When the mortal disappears in improved knowledge cast away

The former things so shall the Mortal gently fade away

And so become invisible to those who still remain

Listen I will tell thee what is done in the caverns of the grave

PAGE 110 \(FIRST PORTION\)

The Lamb of God has rent the Veil of Mystery soon to return

In Clouds & Fires around the rock & the Mysterious tree

As the seed waits Eagerly watching for its flower & fruit

Anxious its little soul looks out into the clear expanse

To see if hungry winds are abroad with their invisible army

So Man looks out in tree & herb & fish & bird & beast

Collecting up the scatterd portions of his immortal body

Into the Elemental forms of every thing that grows

He tries the sullen north wind riding on its angry furrows

10     The sultry south when the sun rises & the angry east

When the sun sets when the clods harden & the cattle stand

Drooping & the birds hide in their silent nests. he stores his thoughts

As in a store house in his memory he regulates the forms

Of all beneath & all above & in the gentle West

Reposes where the Suns heat dwells he rises to the Sun

And to the Planets of the Night & to the stars that gild

The Zodiac & the stars that sullen stand to north & south

He touches the remotest pole & in the Center weeps

That Man should Labour & sorrow & learn & forget & return

20     To the dark valley whence he came to begin his labours anew

In pain he sighs in pain he labours in his universe

Screaming in birds over the deep & howling in the Wolf

Over the slain & moaning in the cattle & in the winds

And weeping over Orc & Urizen in clouds & \[*dismal*\] flaming fires

And in the cries of birth & in the groans of death his voice

Is heard throughout the Universe whereever a grass grows

Or a leaf buds The Eternal Man is seen is heard is felt

And all his Sorrows till he reassumes his ancient bliss

Such are the words of Ahania & Enion. Los hears & weeps

\[*The End of the Eighth Night*\]

30      \[*But Rahab \(built\) hewd a Sepulcher in the Rock of Eternity*

*And placing in the Sepulcher the body which she had taken*

*From the divine Lamb wept over the Sepulcher weaving*

*But as she wove behold the bottom of the Sepulcher*

*Rent & a door was opend thro the bottom of the Sepulcher*

*Into Eternity And as she wove she heard a Voice behind her calling her*

*She turnd & saw the Divine Vision & her*\]

And Los & Enitharmon took the Body of the Lamb

Down from the Cross & placd it in a Sepulcher which Los had hewn

40     For himself in the Rock of Eternity trembling & in despair

Jerusalem wept over the Sepulcher two thousand Years

\[*End of the Eighth Night*\]

Rahab triumphs over all she took Jerusalem

Captive A Willing Captive by delusive arts impelld

To worship Urizens Dragon form to offer her own Children

Upon the bloody Altar. John Saw these things Reveald in Heaven

On Patmos Isle & heard the Souls cry out to be deliverd

He saw the Harlot of the Kings of Earth & saw her Cup

Of fornication food of Orc & Satan pressd from the fruit of Mystery

But when she saw the form of Ahania weeping on the Void

And heard Enions voice sound from the caverns of the Grave

10     No more spirit remaind in her She secretly left the Synagogue of Satan

She commund with Orc in secret She hid him with the flax

That Enitharmon had numberd away from the Heavens

She gatherd it together to consume her Harlot Robes

In bitterest Contrition sometimes Self condemning repentant

And Sometimes kissing her Robes & Jewels & weeping over them

Sometimes returning to the Synagogue of Satan in Pride

And Sometimes weeping before Orc in humility & trembling

The Synagogue of Satan therefore uniting against Mystery

Satan divided against Satan resolvd in open Sanhedrim

20     To burn Mystery with fire & form another from her ashes

For God put it into their heart to fulfill all his will

         The Ashes of Mystery began to animate they calld it Deism

And Natural Religion as of old so now anew began

Babylon again in Infancy Calld Natural Religion

NIGHT THE NINTH

BEING THE LAST JUDGMENT

         And Los & Enitharmon builded Jerusalem weeping

Over the Sepulcher & over the Crucified body

Which to their Phantom Eyes appear’d Still in the Sepulcher

But Jesus stood beside them in the Spirit Separating

Their Spirit from their body. Terrified at Non Existence

For such they deemd the death of the body. Los his vegetable hands

Outstretchd his right hand branching out in fibrous strength

Siezd the Sun. His left hand like dark roots coverd the Moon

And tore them down cracking the heavens across from immense to immense

10     Then fell the fires of Eternity with loud & shrill

Sound of Loud Trumpet thundering along from heaven to heaven

A mighty sound articulate Awake ye dead & come

To Judgment from the four winds Awake & Come away

Folding like scrolls of the Enormous volume of Heaven & Earth

With thunderous noise & dreadful shakings rocking to & fro

The heavens are shaken & the Earth removed from its place

The foundations of the Eternal hills discoverd

The thrones of Kings are shaken they have lost their robes & crowns

The poor smite their opressors they awake up to the harvest

20     The naked warriors rush together down to the sea shore

Trembling before the multitudes of slaves now set at liberty

They are become like wintry flocks like forests stripd of leaves

The opressed pursue like the wind there is no room for escape

The Spectre of Enitharmon let loose on the troubled deep

Waild shrill in the confusion & the Spectre of Urthona

PAGE 118

Recievd her in the darkning South their bodies lost they stood

Trembling & weak a faint embrace a fierce desire as when

Two shadows mingle on a wall they wail & shadowy tears

Fell down & shadowy forms of joy mixd with despair & grief

Their bodies buried in the ruins of the Universe

Mingled with the confusion. Who shall call them from the Grave

         Rahab & Tirzah wail aloud in the wild flames they give up themselves to Consummation

         The books of Urizen unroll with dreadful noise the folding Serpent

Of Orc began to Consume in fierce raving fire his fierce flames

10     Issud on all sides gathring strength in animating volumes

Roaming abroad on all the winds raging intense reddening

Into resistless pillars of fire rolling round & round gathering

Strength from the Earths consumd & heavens & all hidden abysses

Wherever the Eagle has Explord or Lion or Tyger trod

Or where the Comets of the night or stars of \[*eternal*\] asterial day

Have shot their arrows or long beamed spears in wrath & fury

         And all the while the trumpet sounds \[*Awake ye dead & come*

*To fudgment*.\] from the clotted gore & from the hollow den

Start forth the trembling millions into flames of mental fire

Bathing their limbs in the bright visions of Eternity

20     Then like the doves from pillars of Smoke the trembling families

Of women & children throughout every nation under heaven

Cling round the men in bands of twenties & of fifties pale

As snow that falls around a leafless tree upon the green

Their opressors are falln they have Stricken them they awake to life

Yet pale the just man stands erect & looking up to heavn

Trembling & strucken by the Universal stroke the trees unroot

The rocks groan horrible & run about. The mountains & Their rivers cry with a dismal cry the cattle gather together

Lowing they kneel before the heavens. the wild beasts of the forests

30     Tremble the Lion shuddering asks the Leopard. Feelest thou

The dread I feel unknown before My voice refuses to roar

And in weak moans I speak to thee This night

Before the mornings dawn the Eagle calld the Vulture

The Raven calld the hawk I heard them from my forests black

Saying Let us go up far for soon I smell upon the wind

A terror coming from the South. The Eagle & Hawk fled away

At dawn & Eer the sun arose the raven & Vulture followd

Let us flee also to the north. They fled. The Sons of Men

Saw them depart in dismal droves. The trumpet sounded loud

40     And all the Sons of Eternity Descended into Beulah

Folds. The tree of Mystery went up in folding flames

Blood issud out in mighty volumes pouring in whirlpools fierce

From out the flood gates of the Sky The Gates are burst down pour

The torrents black upon the Earth the blood pours down incessant

Kings in their palaces lie drownd Shepherds their flocks their tents

Roll down the mountains in black torrents Cities Villages

Float the dead carcases of Men & Beasts driven to & fro on waves

Of foaming blood beneath the black incessant Sky till all

And when all Tyranny was cut off from the face of Earth

Around the Dragon form of Urizen & round his stony form

The flames rolling intense thro the wide Universe

In furrowd lightnings break their way the wild flames?whirling up

The Bloody Deluge living flames winged with intellect

From the clotted gore & from the hollow den

Start forth the trembling millions into flames of mental fire

Bathing their Limbs in the bright visions of Eternity

\[*without*\] Beyond this Universal Confusion beyond the remotest Pole

Where their vortexes begin to operate there stands

A Horrible rock far in the South it was forsaken when

Urizen gave the horses of Light into the hands of Luvah

On this rock lay the faded head of the Eternal Man

Enwrapped round with weeds of death pale cold in sorrow & woe

30     He lifts the blue lamps of his Eyes & cries with heavenly voice

Bowing his head over the consuming Universe he cried

         O weakness & O weariness O war within my members

My sons exiled from my breast pass to & fro before me

My birds are silent on my hills flocks die beneath my branches

My tents are fallen my trumpets & the sweet sounds of my harp

Is silent on my clouded hills that belch forth storms & fires

My milk of cows & honey of bees & fruit of golden harvest

Are gatherd in the scorching heat & in the driving rain

My robe is turned to confusion & my bright gold to stones

40     Where once I sat I weary walk in misery & pain

For from within my \[*narrow*\] witherd breast grown narrow with my woes

The Corn is turnd to thistles & the apples into poison

The birds of song to murderous crows My joys to bitter groans

PAGE 120

The voices of children in my tents to cries of helpless infants

And all exiled from the face of light & shine of morning

In this dark world a narrow house I wander up & down

I hear Mystery howling in these flames of Consummation

When shall the Man of future times become as in days of old

O weary life why sit I here & give up all my powers

To indolence to the night of death when indolence & mourning

Sit hovring over my dark threshold, tho I arise look out

And scorn the war within my members yet my heart is weak

10     And my head faint Yet will I look again unto the morning

Whence is this sound of rage of Men drinking each others blood

Drunk with the smoking gore & red but not with nourishing wine

         The Eternal Man sat on the Rocks & cried with awful voice

         O Prince of Light where art thou I behold thee not as once

In those Eternal fields in clouds of morning stepping forth

With harps & songs where bright Ahania sang before thy face

And all thy sons & daughters gatherd round my ample table

See you not all this wracking furious confusion

Come forth from slumbers of thy cold abstraction come forth

20     Arise to Eternal births shake off thy cold repose

Schoolmaster of souls great opposer of change arise

That the Eternal worlds may see thy face in peace & joy

That thou dread form of Certainty maist sit in town & village

While little children play around thy feet in gentle awe

Fearing thy frown loving thy smile O Urizen Prince of light

He calld the deep buried his voice & answer none returnd

Then wrath burst round the Eternal Man was wrath again he cried

         Arise O stony form of death O dragon of the Deeps

Lie down before my feet O Dragon let Urizen arise

30     O how couldst thou deform those beautiful proportions

Of life & person for as the Person so is his life proportiond

Let Luvah rage in the dark deep even to Consummation

For if thou feedest not his rage it will subside in peace

But if thou darest obstinate refuse my stern behest

Thy crown & scepter I will sieze & regulate all my members

In stern severity & cast thee out into the indefinite

Where nothing lives, there to wander. & if thou returnst weary

Weeping at the threshold of Existence I will steel my heart

Against thee to Eternity & never recieve thee more

40     Thy self destroying beast formd Science shall be thy eternal lot

My anger against thee is greater than against this Luvah

For war is \[*honest*\] energy Enslavd but thy religion

The first author of this war & the distracting of honest minds

Into confused perturbation & strife & honour & pride

Is a deceit so detestable that I will cast thee out

If thou repentest not & leave thee as a rotten branch to be burnd

With Mystery the Harlot & with Satan for Ever & Ever

Error can never be redeemd in all Eternity

But Sin Even Rahab is redeemd in blood & fury & jealousy

50      That line of blood that stretchd across the windows of the morning

Redeemd from Errors power. Wake thou dragon of the Deeps

         PAGE 121

Urizen wept in the dark deep anxious his Scaly form

To reassume the human & he wept in the dark deep

         Saying O that I had never drank the wine nor eat the bread

Of dark mortality nor cast my view into the \[*past*\] futurity nor turnd

My back darkning the present clouding with a cloud

And building arches high & cities turrets & \[*high*\] towers & domes

Whose smoke destroyd the pleasant garden & whose running Kennels

Chokd the bright rivers burdning with my Ships the angry deep

Thro Chaos seeking for delight & in spaces remote

10     Seeking the Eternal which is always present to the wise

Seeking for pleasure which unsought falls round the infants path

And on the fleeces of mild flocks who neither care nor labour

But I the labourer of ages whose unwearied hands

Are thus deformd with hardness with the \[*?plow*\] sword & with the spear

And with the Chisel & the mallet I whose labours vast

Order the nations separating family by family

Alone enjoy not I alone in misery supreme

Ungratified give all my joy unto this Luvah & Vala

Then Go O dark \[*remembrance*\] futurity I will cast thee forth from these

20     Heavens of my brain nor will I look upon \[*remembrance*\] futurity more

I cast \[*remembrance*\] futurity away & turn my back upon that void

Which I have made for lo futurity is in this moment

Let Orc consume let Tharmas rage let dark Urthona give

All strength to Los & Enitharmon & let Los self cursd

Rend down this fabric as a wall ruind & family extinct

Rage Orc Rage Tharmas Urizen no longer curbs your rage

         So Urizen spoke he shook his snows from off his Shoulders & arose

As on a Pyramid of mist his white robes scattering

The fleecy white renewd he shook his aged mantles off

30     Into the fires Then glorious bright Exulting in his joy

He sounding rose into the heavens in naked majesty

In radiant Youth. when Lo like garlands in the Eastern sky

When vocal may comes dancing from the East Ahania came

Exulting in her flight as when a bubble rises up

On to the surface of a lake. Ahania rose in joy

Excess of Joy is worse than grief – her heart beat high her blood

Burst its bright Vessels She fell down dead at the feet of Urizen

Outstretchd a Smiling corse they buried her in a silent cave

Urizen dropt a tear the Eternal Man Darkend with sorrow

40     The three daughters of Urizen guard Ahanias Death couch

Rising from the confusion in tears & howlings & despair

Calling upon their fathers Name upon their Rivers dark

And the Eternal Man Said Hear my \[*voice*\] words O Prince of Light

PAGE 122

Behold Jerusalem in whose bosom the Lamb of God

Is seen tho slain before her Gates he self renewd remains

Eternal & I thro him awake from deaths dark vale

The times revolve the time is coming when all these delights

Shall be renewd & all these Elements that now consume

Shall reflourish. Then bright Ahania shall awake from death

A glorious Vision \[*of*\] to thine Eyes a Self renewing Vision

The spring. the summer to be thine then sleep the wintry days

In silken garments spun by her own hands against her funeral

10     The winter thou shalt plow & lay thy stores into thy barns

Expecting to recieve Ahania in the spring with joy

Immortal thou. Regenerate She & all the lovely Sex

From her shall learn obedience & prepare for a wintry grave

That spring may see them rise in tenfold joy & sweet delight

Thus shall the male & female live the life of Eternity

Because the Lamb of God Creates himself a bride & wife

That we his Children evermore may live in Jerusalem

Which now descendeth out of heaven a City yet a Woman

Mother of myriads redeemd & born in her spiritual palaces

20     By a New Spiritual birth Regenerated from Death

         Urizen said. I have Erred & my Error remains with me

What Chain encompasses in what Lock is the river of light confind

That issues forth in the morning by measure & the evening by carefulness

Where shall we take our stand to view the infinite & unbounded

Or where are human feet for Lo our eyes are in the heavens

         He ceasd for rivn link from link the bursting Universe explodes

All things reversd flew from their centers rattling bones \[*to bones*\]

To bones Join, shaking convulsd the shivering clay breathes

Each speck of dust to the Earths center nestles round & round

30      In pangs of an Eternal Birth in torment & awe & fear

All spirits deceasd let loose from reptile prisons come in shoals

Wild furies from the tygers brain & from the lions Eyes

And from the ox & ass come moping terrors. from the Eagle

And raven numerous as the leaves of autumn every species

Flock to the trumpet muttring over the sides of the grave & crying

In the fierce wind round heaving rocks & mountains filld with groans

On rifted rocks suspended in the air by inward fires

Many a woful company & many on clouds & waters

Fathers & friends Mothers & Infants Kings & Warriors

40        Priests & chaind Captives met together in a horrible fear

And every one of the dead appears as he had livd before

PAGE 123

And all the marks remain of the slaves scourge & tyrants Crown

And of the Priests oergorged Abdomen & of the merchants thin

Sinewy deception & of the warriors ou\[t\]braving & thoughtlessness

In lineaments too extended & in bones too strait & long

         They shew their wounds they accuse they sieze the opressor howlings began

On the golden palace Songs & joy on the desart the Cold babe

Stands in the furious air he cries the children of six thousand years

Who died in infancy rage furious a mighty multitude rage furious

Naked & pale standing on the expecting air to be deliverd

10      Rend limb from limb the Warrior & the tyrant reuniting in pain

The furious wind still rends around they flee in sluggish effort

         They beg they intreat in vain now they Listend not to intreaty

They view the flames red rolling on thro the wide universe

From the \[*black*\] dark jaws of death beneath & desolate shores remote

These covering Vaults of heaven & these trembling globes of Earth

One Planet \[*cries*\] calls to another & one star enquires of another

What flames are these coming from the South what noise what dreadful rout

As of a battle in the heavens hark heard you not the ’trumpet

As of fierce battle While they spoke the flames come on intense roaring

20     They see him whom they have piercd they wail because of him

They magnify themselves no more against Jerusalem Nor

Against her little ones the innocent accused before the Judges

Shines with immortal Glory trembling the Judge springs from his throne

Hiding his face in the dust beneath the prisoners feet & saying

Brother of Jesus what have I done intreat thy lord for me

Perhaps I may be forgiven While he speaks the flames roll on

         And after the flames appears the Cloud of the Son of Man

Descending from Jerusalem with power and great Glory

All nations look up to the Cloud & behold him who was Crucified

30     The Prisoner answers you scourgd my father to death before my face

While I stood bound with cords & heavy chains. your hipocrisy

Shall now avail you nought. So speaking he dashd him with his foot

         The Cloud is Blood dazling upon the heavens & in the cloud

Above upon its volumes is beheld \[*as*\] a throne & \[*as*\] a pavement

Of precious stones, surrounded by twenty four venerable patriarchs

And these again surrounded \[*of*\] by four Wonders of the Almighty

Incomprehensible. pervading all amidst & round about

Fourfold each in the other reflected they are named Life’s in Eternity

Four Starry Universes going forward from Eternity to Eternity

40     And the Falln Man who was arisen upon the Rock of Ages

PAGE 124

Beheld the Vision of God & he arose up from the Rock

And Urizen arose up with him walking thro the flames

To meet the Lord coming to Judgment but the flames repelld them

Still to the Rock in vain they strove to Enter the Consummation

Together for the \[*Fallen*\] Redeemd Man could not enter the Consummation

         Then siezd the Sons of Urizen the Plow they polishd it

From rust of ages all its ornaments of Gold & silver & ivory

Reshone across the field immense where all the nations

Darkend like Mould in the divided fallows where the weed

10     Triumphs in its own destruction they took down the harness

From the blue walls of heaven starry jingling ornamented

With beautiful art the study of angels the workmanship of Demons

When Heaven & Hell in Emulation strove in sports of Glory

         The noise of rural work resounded thro the heavens of heavens

The horse\[s\] neigh from the battle the wild bulls from the sultry waste

The tygers from the forests & the lions \[*of*\] from the sandy desarts

They Sing they sieze the instruments of harmony they throw away

The spear the bow the gun the mortar they level the fortifications

They beat the iron engines of destruction into wedges

20     They give them to Urthonas Sons ringing the hammers sound

In dens of death to forge the spade the mattock & the ax

The heavy roller to break the clods to pass over the nations

         The Sons of Urizen Shout Their father rose The Eternal horses

Harnessd They calld to Urizen the heavens moved at their call

The limbs of Urizen shone with ardor. \[*he rose up from the Rock.*

         *The Fallen Man wondring beheld*\] He laid his ha\[n\]d on the Plow

Thro dismal darkness drave the Plow of ages over Cities

And all their Villages over Mountains & all their Vallies

Over the graves & caverns of the dead Over the Planets

And over the void Spaces over Sun & moon & star & constellation

30     Then Urizen commanded & they brought the Seed of Men

The trembling souls of All the Dead stood before Urizen

Weak wailing in the troubled air East west & north & south

PAGE 125

He turnd the horses loose & laid his Plow in the northern corner

Of the wide Universal field, then Stepd \[*out*\] forth into the immense

         Then he began to sow the seed he girded round his loins

With a bright girdle & his skirt filld with immortal souls

Howling & Wailing fly the souls from Urizens strong hand

For from the hand of Urizen the myriads fall like stars

Into their own appointed places driven back by the winds

The naked warriors rush together down to the sea shores

They are become like wintry flocks like forests stripd of leaves

10    The Kings & Princes of the Earth cry with a feeble cry

Driven on the unproducing sands & on the hardend rocks

And all the while the flames of Orc follow the ventrous feet

Of Urizen & all the while the Trump of Tharmas sounds

Weeping & wailing fly the souls from Urizens strong hand

The daughters of Urizen stand with Cups & measures of foaming wine

Immense upon the heavens with bread & delicate repasts

Then follows the golden harrow in the midst of Mental fires

To ravishing melody of flutes & harps & softest voice

The seed is harrowd in while flames heat the black mould & cause

20     The human harvest to begin Towards the south first sprang

The myriads & in silent fear they look out from their graves

Then Urizen sits down to rest & all his wearied Sons

Take their repose on beds they drink they sing they view the flames

Of Orc in joy they view the human harvest springing up

A time they give to sweet repose till all the harvest is ripe

And Lo like the harvest Moon Ahania cast off her death clothes

She folded them up in care in silence & her brightning limbs

Bathd in the clear spring of the rock then from her darksom cave

Issud in majesty divine Urizen rose up from his couch

30     On wings of tenfold joy clapping his hands his feet his radiant wings

In the immense as when the Sun dances upon the mountains

A shout of jubilee in lovely notes responding from daughter to daughter

From son to Son as if the Stars beaming innumerable

Thro night should sing soft warbling filling Earth & heaven

And bright Ahania took her seat by Urizen in songs & joy

The Eternal Man also sat down upon the Couches of Beulah

Sorrowful that he could not put off his new risen body

In mental flames the flames refusd they drove him back to Beulah

His body was redeemd to be permanent thro Mercy Divine

PAGE 126

And now fierce Orc had quite consumd himself in Mental flames

Expending all his energy against the fuel of fire

The \[*Ancient Man*\] Regenerate Man stoopd his head over the Universe & in

His holy hands recievd the flaming Demon & Demoness of Smoke

And gave them to Urizens hands the Immortal frownd Saying

Luvah & Vala henceforth you are Servants obey & live

You shall forget your former state return O Love in peace

Into your place the place of seed not in the brain or heart

If Gods combine against Man Setting their Dominion above

10     The Human form Divine. Thrown down from their high Station

In the Eternal heavens of Human \[*Thought*\] Imagination: buried beneath

In dark oblivion with incessant pangs ages on ages

In Enmity & war first weakend then in stern repentance

They must renew their brightness & their disorganizd functions

Again reorganize till they resume the image of the human

Cooperating in the bliss of Man obeying his Will

Servants to the infinite & Eternal of the Human form

Luvah & Vala descended & enterd the Gates of Dark Urthona

And walkd from the hands of Urizen in the shadows of Valas Garden

20     Where the impressions of Despair & Hope for ever vegetate

In flowers in fruits in fishes birds & beasts & clouds & waters

The land of doubts & shadows sweet delusions unformd hopes

They saw no more the terrible confusion of the wracking universe

They heard not saw not felt not all the terrible confusion

For in their orbed senses within closd up they wanderd at will

And those upon the Couches viewd them in the dreams of Beulah

As they reposd from the terrible wide universal harvest

Invisible Luvah in bright clouds hoverd over Valas head

And thus their ancient golden age renewd for Luvah spoke

30     With voice mild from his golden Cloud upon the breath of morning

Come forth O Vala from the grass & from the silent Dew

Rise from the dews of death for the Eternal Man is Risen

She rises among flowers & looks toward the Eastern clearness

She walks yea runs her feet are wingd on the tops of the bending grass

Her garments rejoice in the vocal wind & her hair glistens with dew

She answerd thus Whose voice is this in the voice of the nourishing air

In the spirit of the morning awaking the Soul from its grassy bed

PAGE 127

Where dost thou dwell for it is thee I seek & but for thee

I must have slept Eternally nor have felt the dew of thy morning

Look how the opening dawn advances with vocal harmony

Look how the beams foreshew the rising of some glorious power

The sun is thine \[*when*\] he goeth forth in his majestic brightness

O thou creating voice that callest & who shall answer thee

Where dost thou flee O fair one where dost thou seek thy happy place

To yonder brightness there I haste for sure I came from thence

Or I must have slept eternally nor have felt the dew of morning

10     Eternally thou must have slept nor have felt the morning dew

But for yon nourishing sun tis that by which thou art arisen

The birds adore the sun the beasts rise up & play in his beams

And every flower & every leaf rejoices in his light

Then O thou fair one sit thee down for thou art as the grass

Thou risest in the dew of morning & at night art folded up

Alas am I but as a flower then will I sit me down

Then will I weep then Ill complain & sigh for immortality

And chide my maker thee O Sun that raisedst me to fall

So saying she sat down & wept beneath the apple trees

20     O be thou blotted out thou Sun that raisedst me to trouble

That gavest me a heart to crave & raisedst me thy phantom

To feel thy heat & see thy light & wander here alone

Hopeless if I am like the grass & so shall pass away

Rise sluggish Soul why sitst thou here why dost thou sit & weep

Yon Sun shall wax old & decay but thou shalt ever flourish

The fruit shall ripen & fall down & the flowers consume away

But thou shalt still survive arise O dry thy dewy tears

Hah\! Shall I still survive whence came that sweet & comforting voice

And whence that voice of sorrow O sun thou art nothing now to me

30     Go on thy course rejoicing & let us both rejoice together

I walk among his flocks & hear the bleating of his lambs

O that I could behold his face & follow his pure feet

I walk by the footsteps of his flocks come hither tender flocks

Can you converse with a pure Soul that seeketh for her maker

You answer not then am I set your mistress in this garden

Ill watch you & attend your footsteps you are not like the birds

PAGE 128

That sing & fly in the bright air but you do lick my feet

And let me touch your wooly backs follow me as I sing

For in my bosom a new song arises to my Lord

Rise up O Sun most glorious minister & light of day

Flow on ye gentle airs & bear the voice of my rejoicing

Wave freshly clear waters flowing around the tender grass

And thou sweet smelling ground put forth thy life in fruits & flowers

Follow me O my flocks & hear me sing my rapturous Song

I will cause my voice to be heard on the clouds that glitter in the sun

10     I will call & who shall answer me I will sing who shall reply

For from my pleasant hills behold the living living springs

Running among my green pastures delighting among my trees

I am not here alone my flocks you are my brethren

And you birds that sing & adorn the sky you are my sisters

I sing & you reply to my Song I rejoice & you are glad

Follow me O my flocks we will now descend into the valley

O how delicious are the grapes flourishing in the Sun

How clear the spring of the rock running among the golden sand

How cool the breezes of the vally & the arms of the branching trees

20     Cover us from the sun come & let us sit in the Shade

My Luvah here hath placd me in a Sweet & pleasant Land

And given me fruits & pleasant waters & warm hills & cool valleys

Here will I build myself a house & here Ill call on his name

Here Ill return when I am weary & take my pleasant rest

So spoke the Sinless Soul & laid her head on the downy fleece

Of a curld Ram who stretchd himself in sleep beside his mistress

And soft sleep fell upon her eyelids in the silent noon of day

Then Luvah passed by & saw the sinless Soul

And said Let a pleasant house arise to be the dwelling place

30     Of this immortal Spirit growing in lower Paradise

He spoke & pillars were builded & walls as white as ivory

The grass she slept upon was pavd with pavement as of pearl

Beneath her rose a downy bed & a cieling coverd all

Vala awoke. When in the pleasant gates of sleep I enterd

I saw my Luvah like a spirit stand in the bright air

Round him stood spirits like me who reard me a bright house

And here I see thee house remain in my most pleasant world

PAGE 129

My Luvah smild I kneeled down he laid his hand on my head

And when he laid his hand upon me from the gates of sleep I came

Into this bodily house to tend my flocks in my pleasant garden

So saying she arose & walked round her beautiful house

And then from her white door she lookd to see her bleating lambs

But her flocks were gone up from beneath the trees into the hills

I see the hand that leadeth me doth also lead my flocks

She went up to her flocks & turned oft to see her shining house

She stopd to drink of the clear spring & eat the grapes & apples

10     She bore the fruits in her lap she gatherd flowers for her bosom

She called to her flocks saying follow me o my flocks

They followd her to the silent vally beneath the spreading trees

And on the rivers margin she ungirded her golden girdle

She stood in the river & viewd herself within the watry glass

And her bright hair was wet with the waters She rose up from the river

And as she rose her Eyes were opend to the world of waters

She saw Tharmas sitting upon the rocks beside the wavy sea

He strokd the water from his beard & mournd faint thro the summer vales

And Vala stood on the rocks of Tharmas & heard his mournful voice

20     O Enion my weary head is in the bed of death

For weeds of death have wrapd around my limbs in the hoary deeps

I sit in the place of shells & mourn & thou art closd in clouds

When will the time of Clouds be past & the dismal night of Tharmas

Arise O Enion Arise & smile upon my head

As thou dost smile upon the barren mountains and they rejoice

When wilt thou smile on Tharmas O thou bringer of golden day

Arise O Enion arise for Lo I have calmd my seas

So saying his faint head he laid upon the Oozy rock

And darkness coverd all the deep the light of Enion faded

30     Like a fa\[i\]nt flame quivering upon the surface of the darkness

Then Vala lifted up her hands to heaven to call on Enion

She calld but none could answer her & the Eccho of her voice returnd

Where is the voice of God that calld me from the silent dew

Where is the Lord of Vala dost thou hide in clefts of the rock

Why shouldst thou hide thyself from Vala from the soul that wanders desolate

She ceas’d & light beamd round her like the glory of the morning

PAGE 130

And She arose out of the river & girded her golden girdle

And now her feet step on the grassy bosom of the ground

Among her flocks & she turnd her eyes toward her pleasant house

And saw in the door way beneath the trees two little children playing

She drew near to her house & her flocks followd her footsteps

The Children clung around her knees she embracd them & wept over them

Thou little Boy art Tharmas & thou bright Girl Enion

How are ye thus renewd & brought into the Gardens of Vala

She embracd them in tears, till the sun descended the western hills

10     And then she enterd her bright house leading her mighty children

And when night came the flocks laid round the house beneath the trees

She laid the Children on the beds which she saw prepard in the house

Then last herself laid down & closd her Eyelids in soft slumbers

And in the morning when the Sun arose in the crystal sky

Vala awoke & calld the children from their gentle slumbers

Awake O Enion awake & let thine innocent Eyes

Enlighten all the Crystal house of Vala awake awake

Awake Tharmas awake awake thou child of dewy tears

Open the orbs of thy blue eyes & smile upon my gardens

20     The Children woke & smild on Vala. she kneeld by the golden couch

She presd them to her bosom & her pearly tears dropd down

O my sweet Children Enion let Tharmas kiss thy Cheek

Why dost thou turn thyself away from his sweet watry eyes

Tharmas henceforth in Valas bosom thou shalt find sweet peace

O bless the lovely eyes of Tharmas & the Eyes of Enion

They rose they went out wandring sometimes together sometimes alone

Why weepest thou Tharmas Child of tears in the bright house of joy

Doth Enion avoid the sight of thy blue heavenly Eyes

And dost thou wander with my lambs & \[*with*\] wet their innocent faces

30     With thy bright tears because the steps of Enion are in the gardens

Arise sweet boy & let us follow the path of Enion

So saying they went down into the garden among the fruits

And Enion sang among the flowers that grew among the trees

And Vala said Go Tharmas weep not Go to Enion

PAGE 131

He said O Vala I am sick & all this garden of Pleasure

Swims like a dream before my eyes but the sweet smelling fruit

Revives me to new deaths I fade even like a water lilly

In the suns heat till in the night on the couch of Enion

I drink new life & feel the breath of sleeping Enion

But in the morning she arises to avoid my Eyes

Then my loins fade & in the house I sit me down & weep

Chear up thy Countenance bright boy & go to Enion

Tell her that Vala waits her in the shadows of her garden

10     He went with timid steps & Enion like the ruddy morn

When infant spring appears in swelling buds & opening flowers

Behind her Veil withdraws so Enion turnd her modest head

But Tharmas spoke Vala seeks thee sweet Enion in the shades

Follow the steps of Tharmas, O thou brightness of the gardens

He took her hand reluctant she followd in infant doubts

Thus in Eternal Childhood straying among Valas flocks

In infant sorrow & joy alternate Enion & Tharmas playd

Round Vala in the Gardens of Vala & by her rivers margin

They are the shadows of Tharmas & of Enion in Valas world

20     And the sleepers who rested from their harvest work beheld these visions

Thus were the sleepers entertaind upon the Couches of Beulah

When Luvah & Vala were closd up in their world of shadowy forms

Darkness was all beneath the heavens only a little light

Such as glows out from sleeping spirits appeard in the deeps beneath

As when the wind sweeps over a Corn field the noise of souls

Thro all the immense borne down by Clouds swagging in autumnal heat

Muttering along from heaven to heaven hoarse roll the human forms

Beneath thick clouds dreadful lightnings burst & thunders roll

Down pour the torrent Floods of heaven on all the human harvest

30     Then Urizen sitting at his repose on beds in the bright South

Cried Times are Ended he Exulted he arose in joy he exulted

He pourd his light & all his Sons & daughters pourd their light

To exhale the spirits of Luvah & Vala thro the atmosphere

And Luvah & Vala saw the Light their spirits were Exhald

In all their ancient innocence the floods depart the clouds

Dissipate or sink into the Seas of Tharmas Luvah sat

Above on the bright heavens in peace. the Spirits of Men beneath

Cried out to be deliverd & the Spirit of Luvah wept

Over the human harvest & over Vala the sweet wanderer

40     In pain the human harvest wavd in horrible groans of woe

PAGE I32

The Universal Groan went up the Eternal Man was Darkend

Then Urizen arose & took his Sickle in his hand

There is a brazen sickle & a scythe of iron hid

Deep in the South guarded by a few solitary stars

This sickle Urizen took the scythe his sons embracd

And went forth & began to reap & all his joyful sons

Reapd the wide Universe & bound in Sheaves a wondrous harvest

They took them into the wide barns with loud rejoicings & triumph

Of flute & harp & drum & trumpet horn & clarion

10     The feast was spread in the bright South & the Regenerate Man

Sat at the feast rejoicing & the wine of Eternity

Was servd round by the flames of Luvah all Day & all the Night

And when Morning began to dawn upon the distant hills

\[*Then*\] a whirlwind rose up in the Center & in the Whirlwind a Shriek

And in the Shriek a rattling of bones & in the rattling of bones

A dolorous groan & from the dolorous groan in tears

Rose Enion like a gentle light & Enion spoke saying

O Dreams of Death the human form dissolving companied

\[*With*\] By beasts & worms & creeping things & darkness & despair

20     The clouds fall off from my wet brow the dust from my cold limbs

Into the Sea of Tharmas Soon renewd a Golden Moth

I shall cast off my death clothes & Embrace Tharmas again

For Lo the winter melted away upon the distant hills

And all the black mould sings. She speas to her infant race her milk

Descends \[*of*\] down on the sand. the thirsty sand drinks & rejoices

Wondering to behold the Emmet the Grasshopper the jointed worm

The roots shoot thick thro the solid rocks bursting their way

They cry out in joys of existence. the broad stems

Rear on the mountains stem after stem the scaly newt creeps

30     From the stone & the armed fly springs from the rocky crevice

The spider. The bat burst from the hardend slime crying

To one another What are we & whence is our joy & delight

Lo the little moss begins to spring & the tender weed

Creeps round our secret nest. Flocks brighten the Mountains

Herds throng up the Valley wild beasts fill the forests

Joy thrilld thro all the Furious form of Tharmas humanizing

Mild he Embracd her whom he sought he raisd her thro the heavens

Sounding his trumpet to awake the dead on high he soard

Over the ruind worlds the smoking tomb of the Eternal Prophet

PAGE 133

The Eternal Man arose He welcomd them to the Feast

The feast was spread in the bright South & the Eternal Man

Sat at the feast rejoicing & the wine of Eternity

Was servd round by the flames of Luvah all day & all the night

And Many Eternal Men sat at the golden feast to see

The female form now separate They shudderd at the horrible thing

Not born for the sport and amusement of Man but born to drink up all his powers

\[*And*\] They wept to see their shadows they said to one another this is Sin

This is the \[*vegetative*\] Generative world they rememberd the Days of old

10     And One of the Eternals spoke All was silent at the feast

Man is a Worm wearied with joy he seeks the caves of sleep

Among the Flowers of Beulah in his selfish cold repose

Forsaking Brotherhood & Universal love in selfish clay

Folding the pure wings of his mind seeking the places dark

Abstracted from the roots of \[*Nature*\] Science then inclosd around

In walls of Gold we cast him like a Seed into the Earth

Till times & spaces have passd over him duly every morn

We visit him covering with a Veil the immortal seed

With windows from the inclement sky we cover him & with walls

20     And hearths protect the Selfish terror till divided all

![Image](images/000001.jpg)

Not for ourselves but for the Eternal family we live

Man liveth not by Self alone but in his brothers face

Each shall behold the Eternal Father & love & joy abound

So spoke the Eternal at the Feast they embracd the New born Man

Calling him Brother image of the Eternal Father. they sat down

At the immortal tables sounding loud their instruments of joy

30     Calling the Morning into Beulah the Eternal Man rejoicd

When Morning dawnd The Eternals rose to labour at the Vintage

Beneath they saw their sons & daughters wondering inconceivable

At the dark myriads in Shadows in the worlds beneath

The morning dawnd Urizen rose & in his hand the Flail

Sounds on the Floor heard terrible by all beneath the heavens

Dismal loud redounding the nether floor shakes with the sound

PAGE 134

And all Nations were threshed out & the stars threshd from their husks

Then Tharmas took the Winnowing fan the winnowing wind furious

Above veerd round by the violent whirlwind driven west & south

Tossed the Nations like Chaff into the seas of Tharmas

O Mystery Fierce Tharmas cries Behold thy end is come

Art thou she that made the nations drunk with the cup of Religion

Go down ye Kings & Councillors & Giant Warriors

Go down into the depths go down & hide yourselves beneath

Go down with horse & Chariots & Trumpets of hoarse war

10     Lo how the Pomp of Mystery goes down into the Caves

Her great men howl & throw the dust & rend their hoary hair

Her delicate women & children shriek upon the bitter wind

Spoild of their beauty their hair rent & their skin shriveld up

Lo darkness covers the long pomp of banners on the wind

And black horses & armed men & miserable bound captives

Where shall the graves recieve them all & where shall be their place

And who shall mourn for Mystery who never loosd her Captives

Let the slave grinding at the mill run out into the field

Let him look up into the heavens & laugh in the bright air

20     Let the inchaind soul shut up in darkness & in sighing

Whose face has never seen a smile in thirty weary years

Rise & look out his chains are loose his dungeon doors are open

And let his wife & children return from the opressors scourge

They look behind at every step & believe it is a dream

Are these the Slaves that groand along the streets of Mystery

Where are your bonds & task masters are these the prisoners

Where are your chains where are your tears why do you look around

If you are thirsty there is the river go bathe your parched limbs

The good of all the Land is before you for Mystery is no more

30     Then All the Slaves from every Earth in the wide Universe

Sing a New Song drowning confusion in its happy notes

While the flail of Urizen sounded long & the winnowing wind of Tharmas

So loud so clear in the wide heavens & the song that they sung was this

Composed by an African Black from the little Earth of Sotha

Aha Aha how came I here so soon in my sweet native land

How came I here Methinks I am as I was in my youth

PAGE 135

When in my fathers house I sat & heard his chearing voice

Methinks I see his flocks & herds & feel my limbs renewd

And Lo my Brethren in their tents & their little ones around them

The song arose to the Golden feast the Eternal Man rejoicd

Then the Eternal Man said Luvah the Vintage is ripe arise

The sons of Urizen shall gather the vintage with sharp hooks

And all thy sons O Luvah bear away the families of Earth

I hear the flail of Urizen his barns are full no roo\[m\]

Remains & in the Vineyards stand the abounding sheaves beneath

10     The falling Grapes that odorous burst upon the winds. Arise

My flocks & herds trample the Corn my cattle browze upon

The ripe Clusters The shepherds shout for Luvah prince of Love

Let the Bulls of Luvah tread the Corn & draw the loaded waggon

Into the Barn while children glean the Ears around the door

Then shall they lift their innocent hands & stroke his furious nose

And he shall lick the little girls white neck & on her head

Scatter the perfume of his breath while from his mountains high

The lion of terror shall come down & bending his bright mane

And couching at their side shall eat from the curld boys white lap

20     His golden food and in the evening sleep before the door

Attempting to be more than Man We become less said Luvah

As he arose from the bright feast drunk with the wine of ages

His crown of thorns fell from his head he hung his living Lyre

Behind the seat of the Eternal Man & took his way

Sounding the Song of Los descending to the Vineyards bright

His sons arising from the feast with golden baskets follow

A fiery train as when the Sun sings in the ripe vineyards

Then Luvah stood before the wine press all his fiery sons

Brought up the loaded Waggons with shoutings ramping tygers play

30     In the jingling traces furious lions sound the song of joy

To the golden wheels circling upon the pavement of heaven & all

The Villages of Luvah ring the golden tiles of the villages

Reply to violins & tabors to the pipe flute lyre & cymbal

Then fell the Legions of Mystery in maddning confusion

Down Down thro the immense with outcry fury & despair

Into the wine presses of Luvah howling fell the Clusters

Of human families thro the deep. the wine presses were filld

The blood of life flowd plentiful Odors of life arose

All round the heavenly arches & the Odors rose singing this song

PAGE 136

O terrible wine presses of Luvah O caverns of the Grave

How lovely the delights of those risen again from death

O trembling joy excess of joy is like Excess of grief

So sang the Human Odors round the wine presses of Luvah

But in the Wine presses is wailing terror & despair

Forsaken of their Elements they vanish & are no more

No more but a desire of Being a distracted ravening desire

Desiring like the hungry worm & like the \[*silent*\] gaping grave

They plunge into the Elements the Elements cast them forth

10     Or else consume their shadowy semblance Yet they obstinate

Tho pained to distraction Cry O let us Exist for

This dreadful Non Existence is worse than pains of Eternal \[*death*\] Birth

Eternal Death who can Endure. let us consume in fires

In waters stifling or in air corroding or in earth shut up

The Pangs of Eternal birth are better than the Pangs of Eternal Death

How red the Sons & daughters of Luvah how they tread the Grapes

Laughing & shouting drunk with odors many fall oerwearied

Drownd in the wine is many a youth & maiden those around

Lay them on skins of tygers or the spotted Leopard or wild Ass

20     Till they revive or bury them in cool Grots making lamentation

But in the Wine Presses the Human Grapes Sing not nor dance

They howl & writhe in shoals of torment in fierce flames consuming

In chains of iron & in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires

In pits & dens & shades of death in shapes of torment & woe

The Plates the Screws \[*the nets*\] and Racks & Saws & cords & fires & floods

The cruel joy of Luvahs daughters lacerating with knives

And whip\[s\] their Victims & the deadly sports of Luvahs sons

Timbrels & Violins sport round the Wine Presses The little Seed

The Sportive root the Earthworm the small beetle the wise Emmet

30     Dance round the Wine Presses of Luvah. the Centipede is there

The ground Spider with many Eyes the Mole clothed in Velvet

The Earwig armd the tender maggot emblem of Immortality

The Slow Slug the grasshopper that sings & laughs & drinks

The winter comes he folds his slender bones without a murmur

There is the Nettle that stings with soft down & there

The indignant Thistle whose bitterness is bred in his milk

And who lives on the contempt of his neighbour there all the idle weeds

That creep about the obscure places shew their various limbs

Naked in all their beauty dancing round the Wine Presses

40     They Dance around the Dying & they Drink the howl & groan

PAGE 137

They catch the Shrieks in cups of gold they hand them to one another

These are the sports of love & these the sweet delights of amorous play

Tears of the grapes the death sweat of the Cluster the last sigh

Of the mild youth who listens to the luring songs of Luvah

The Eternal Man darkend with Sorrow & a wintry mantle

Coverd the Hills He said O Tharmas rise & O Urthona

Then Tharmas & Urthona rose from the Golden feast satiated

With Mirth & Joy Urthona limping from his fall on Tharmas leand

In his right hand his hammer Tharmas held his Shepherds crook

10     Beset with gold gold were the ornaments formd by sons of Urizen

Then Enion & Ahania & Vala & the wife of Dark Urthona

Rose from the feast in joy ascending to their Golden Looms

There the wingd shuttle Sang the spindle & the distaff & the Reel

Rang sweet the praise of industry. Thro all the golden rooms

Heaven rang with winged Exultation All beneath howld loud

With tenfold rout & desolation roard the Chasms beneath

Where the wide woof flowd down & where the Nations are gatherd together

Tharmas went down to the Wine presses & beheld the sons & daughters

20     Of Luvah quite exhausted with the Labour & quite filld

With new wine. that they began to torment one another and to tread

The weak. Luvah & Vala slept on the floor o’erwearied

Urthona calld his Sons around him Tharmas calld his sons

Numrous. they took the wine they separated the Lees

And Luvah was put for dung on the ground by the Sons of Tharmas & Urthona

They formed heavens of sweetest wo\[o\]d\[s\] of gold & silver & ivory

Of glass & precious stones They loaded all the waggons of heaven

And took away the wine of ages with solemn songs & joy

Luvah & Vala woke & all the sons & daughters of Luvah

Awoke they wept to one another & they reascended

30     To the Eternal Man in woe he cast them wailing into

The world of shadows thro the air till winter is over & gone

But the Human Wine stood wondering in all their delightful Expanses

The Elements subside the heavens rolld on with vocal harmony

Then Los who is Urthona rose in all his regenerate power

The Sea that rolld & foamd with darkness & the shadows of death

Vomited out & gave up all the floods lift up their hands

Singing & shouting to the Man they bow their hoary heads

And murmuring in their channels flow & circle round his feet

PAGE 138

Then Dark Urthona took the Corn out of the Stores of Urizen

He ground it in his rumbling Mills Terrible the distress

Of all the Nations of Earth ground in the Mills of Urthona

In his hand Tharmas takes the Storms. he turns the whirlwind Loose

Upon the wheels the stormy seas howl at his dread command

And Eddying fierce rejoice in the fierce agitation of the wheels

Of Dark Urthona Thunders Earthquakes Fires Water floods

Rejoice to one another loud their voices shake the Abyss

Their dread forms tending the dire mills The grey hoar frost was there

10     And his pale wife the aged Snow they watch over the fires

They build the Ovens of Urthona Nature in darkness groans

And Men are bound to sullen contemplations in the night

Restless they turn on beds of sorrow. in their inmost brain

Feeling the crushing Wheels they rise they write the bitter words

Of Stern Philosophy & knead the bread of knowledge with tears & groans

Such are the works of Dark Urthona Tharmas sifted the corn

Urthona made the Bread of Ages & he placed it

In golden & in silver baskets in heavens of precious stone

And then took his repose in Winter in the night of Time

20     The Sun has left his blackness & has found a fresher morning

\[*Then*\] And the mild moon rejoices in the clear & cloudless night

And Man walks forth from midst of the fires the evil is all consumd

His eyes behold the Angelic spheres arising night & day

The stars consumd like a lamp blown out & in their stead behold

The Expanding Eyes of Man behold the depths of wondrous worlds

One Earth one sea beneath nor Erring Globes wander but Stars

Of fire rise up nightly from the Ocean & one Sun

Each morning like a New born Man issues with songs & Joy

Calling the Plowman to his Labour & the Shepherd to his rest

30     He walks upon the Eternal Mountains raising his heavenly voice

Conversing with the Animal forms of wisdom night & day

That risen from the Sea of fire renewd walk oer the Earth

For Tharmas brought his flocks upon the hills & in the Vales

Around the Eternal Mans bright tent the little Children play

Among the wooly flocks The hammer of Urthona sounds

In the deep caves beneath his limbs renewd his Lions roar

Around the Furnaces & in the Evening sport upon the plains

They raise their faces from the Earth conversing with the Man

How is it we have walkd thro fires & yet are not consumd

40     How is it that all things are changd even as in ancient times

PAGE 139

The Sun arises from his dewy bed & the fresh airs

Play in his smiling beams giving the seeds of life to grow

And the fresh Earth beams forth ten thousand thousand springs of life

Urthona is arisen in his strength no longer now

Divided from Enitharmon no longer the Spectre Los

Where is the Spectre of Prophecy where the delusive Phantom

Departed & Urthona rises from the ruinous walls

In all his ancient strength to form the golden armour of science

For intellectual War The war of swords departed now

10     The dark Religions are departed & sweet Science reigns

A fairy \[*leapt*\] skipd upon my knee  
Singing & dancing merrily  
I said Thou thing of patches rings  
Pins Necklaces & such like things  
Disguiser of the Female Form  
Thou paltry gilded poisnous worm  
Weeping he fell upon my thigh  
And thus in tears did soft reply  
Knowest thou not O Fairies Lord  
How much by us Contemnd Abhorrd  
Whatever hides the Female form  
That cannot bear the Mental storm  
Therefore in Pity still we give  
Our lives to make the Female live  
And what would turn into disease  
We turn to what will joy & please

Around the Springs of Gray my wild root weaves  
Traveller repose & Dream among my leaves.

TO Mrs ANN FLAXMAN

A little Flower grew in a lonely Vale  
Its form was lovely but its colours. pale  
One standing in the Porches of the Sun  
When his Meridian Glories were begun  
Leapd from the steps of fire & on the grass  
Alighted where this little flower was  
With hands divine he movd the gentle Sod  
And took the Flower up in its native Clod  
Then planting it upon a Mountains brow  
’Tis your own fault if you dont flourish now



## ********POEMS FROM LETTERS





TO JOHN FLAXMAN, 12 SEPTEMBER 1800 \[POSTMARK\]

To My Dearest Friend, John Flaxman, these lines:

I bless thee, O Father of Heaven & Earth, that ever I saw Flaxman’s face.

Angels stand round my Spirit in Heaven, the blessed of Heaven are my friends upon Earth.

When Flaxman was taken to Italy, Fuseli was given to me for a season,

And now Flaxman hath given me Hayley his friend to be mine, such my lot upon Earth.

Now my lot in the Heavens is this, Milton lov’d me in childhood & shew’d me his face.

Ezra came with Isaiah the Prophet, but Shakespeare in riper years gave me his hand;

Paracelsus & Behmen appear’d to me, terrors appear’d in the Heavens above

And in Hell beneath, & a mighty & awful change threatened the Earth.

The American War began. All its dark horrors passed before my face

Across the Atlantic to France. Then the French

10  Revolution commenc’d in thick clouds,  

And My Angels have told me that seeing such visions I could not subsist on the Earth,

But by my conjunction with Flaxman, who knows to forgive Nervous Fear.

TO MRS FLAXMAN, 14 SEPTEMBER 1800

To my dear Friend Mrs Anna Flaxman

  H\[ercules\] B\[uildings\] Lambeth, 14 Sepr 1800

This Song to the flower of Flaxmans joy  
To the blossom of hope for a sweet decoy  
Do all that you can or all that you may  
To entice him to Felpham & far away

Away to Sweet Felpham for Heaven is there  
The Ladder of Angels descends thro the air  
On the Turret its spiral does softly descend  
Thro’ the village then winds at My Cot i\[t\] does end

You stand in the village & look up to heaven

10  The precious stones glitter on flights seventy seven  
      And My Brother is there & My Friend & Thine  
      Descend & Ascend with the Bread & the Wine

The Bread of sweet Thought & the Wine of Delight  
Feeds the Village of Felpham by day & by night  
And at his own door the blessd Hermit does stand  
Dispensing Unceasing to all the whole Land

TO THOMAS BUTTS, 2 OCTOBER 1800

To my Friend Butts I write  
My first Vision of Light  
On the yellow sands sitting  
The Sun was Emitting  
His Glorious beams  
From Heavens high Streams  
Over Sea over Land  
My Eyes did Expand  
Into regions of air

10  Away from all Care  
      Into regions of fire  
      Remote from Desire  
      The Light of the Morning  
      Heavens Mountains adorning   
       In particles bright  
      The jewels of Light  
      Distinct shone & clear –  
      Amazd & in fear  
      I each particle gazed,

20  Astonishd Amazed  
      For each was a Man  
      Human formd. Swift I ran  
      For they beckond to me  
      Remote by the Sea  
      Saying. Each grain of Sand  
      Every Stone on the Land  
      Each rock & each hill  
      Each fountain & rill  
      Each herb & each tree

30  Mountain hill Earth & Sea  
      Cloud Meteor & Star  
      Are Men Seen Afar  
      I stood in the Streams  
      Of Heavens bright beams  
      And Saw Felpham sweet  
      Beneath my bright feet  
      In soft Female charms  
      And in her fair arms  
      My Shadow I knew  
      And my wifes shadow too

40  And My Sister & Friend.  
      We like Infants descend  
      In our Shadows on Earth  
      Like a weak mortal birth  
      My Eyes more & more  
      Like a Sea without shore  
      Continue Expanding  
      The Heavens commanding  
      Till the Jewels of Light

50   Heavenly Men beaming bright  
      Appeard as One Man  
      Who Complacent began  
      My limbs to infold  
      In his beams of bright gold  
      Like dross purgd away  
      All my mire & my clay  
      Soft consumd in delight  
      In his bosom Sun bright  
      I remaind. Soft he smild

60   And I heard his voice Mild  
      Saying This is My Fold  
      O thou Ram hornd with gold  
      Who awakest from Sleep  
      On the Sides of the Deep  
      On the Mountains around  
      The roarings resound  
      Of the lion & wolf  
      The loud Sea & deep gulf.  
      These are guards of My Fold

70   O thou Ram hornd with gold  
      And the voice faded mild  
      I remaind as a Child  
      All I ever had known  
      Before me bright Shone  
      I saw you & your wife  
      By the fountains of Life  
      Such the Vision to me  
      Appeard on the Sea

TO MRS BUTTS

Wife of the Friend of those I most revere.  
Recieve this tribute from a Harp sincere  
Go on in Virtuous Seed sowing on Mold  
Of Human Vegetation & Behold  
Your Harvest Springing to Eternal life  
Parent of Youthful Minds & happy Wife

TO THOMAS BUTTS, 22 NOVEMBER 1802

With happiness stretchd across the hills  
In a cloud that dewy sweetness distills  
With a blue sky spread over with wings  
And a mild sun that mounts & sings  
With trees & fields full of Fairy elves  
And little devils who fight for themselves  
Remembring the Verses that Hayley sung  
When my heart knockd against the root of my tongue  
With Angels planted in Hawthorn bowers

10  And God himself in the passing hours  
      With Silver Angels across my way  
      And Golden Demons that none can stay  
      With my Father hovering upon the wind  
      And my Brother Robert just behind  
      And my Brother John the evil one  
      In a black cloud making his mone  
      Tho dead they appear upon my path  
      Notwithstanding my terrible wrath  
      They beg they intreat they drop their tears

20   Filld full of hopes filld full of fears  
      With a thousand Angels upon the Wind  
      Pouring disconsolate from behind  
      To drive them off & before my way  
      A frowning Thistle implores my stay  
      What to others a trifle appears  
      Fills me full of smiles or tears  
      For double the vision my Eyes do see  
      And a double vision is always with me  
      With my inward Eye ’tis an old Man grey

30   With my outward a Thistle across my way  
      ‘If thou goest back the thistle said  
      Thou art to endless woe betrayd  
      For here does Theotormon lower  
      And here is Enitharmons bower  
      And Los the terrible thus hath sworn  
      Because thou backward dost return  
      Poverty Envy old age & fear  
      Shall bring thy Wife upon a bier  
      And Butts shall give what Fuseli gave

40  A dark black Rock & a gloomy Cave.’  

I struck the Thistle with my foot  
And broke him up from his delving root  
‘Must the duties of life each other cross’  
‘Must every joy be dung & dross’  
‘Must my dear Butts feel cold neglect’  
‘Because I give Hayley his due respect’  
‘Must Flaxman look upon me as wild’  
‘And all my friends be with doubts beguild’  
‘Must my Wife live in my Sisters bane’

50 ‘Or my sister survive on my Loves pain’

‘The curses of Los the terrible shade’  
‘And his dismal terrors make me afraid’

So I spoke & struck in my wrath  
The old man weltering upon my path  
Then Los appeard in all his power  
In the Sun he appeard descending before  
My face in fierce flames in my double sight  
Twas outward a Sun: inward Los in his might

‘My hands are labourd day & night’  
‘And Ease comes never in my sight’

60  ‘My Wife has no indulgence given’  
      ‘Except what comes to her from heaven’  
      ‘We eat little we drink less’  
      ‘This Earth breeds not our happiness’  
      ‘Another Sun feeds our lifes streams’  
      ‘We are not warmed with thy beams’  
      ‘Thou measurest not the Time to me’  
      ‘Nor yet the Space that I do see’  
      ‘My Mind is not with thy light arrayd’

70 ‘Thy terrors shall not make me afraid’

When I had my Defiance given  
The Sun stood trembling in heaven  
The Moon that glowd remote below  
Became leprous & white as snow  
And every Soul of men on the Earth  
Felt affliction & sorrow & sickness & dearth  
Los flamd in my path & the Sun was hot  
With the bows of my Mind & the Arrows of Thought  
My bowstring fierce with Ardour breathes

80  My arrows glow in their golden sheaves  
      My brothers & father march before  
      The heavens drop with human gore

Now I a fourfold vision see  
And a fourfold vision is given to me  
Tis fourfold in my supreme delight  
And three fold in soft Beulahs night  
And twofold Always. May God us keep  
From Single vision & Newtons sleep

TO THOMAS BUTTS, 16 AUGUST 1803

O why was I born with a different face  
Why was I not born like the rest of my race  
When I look each one starts\! when I speak I offend  
Then I’m silent & passive & lose every Friend

Then my verse I dishonour. My pictures despise  
My person degrade & my temper chastise  
And the pen is my terror. the pencil my shame  
All my Talents I bury, and dead is my Fame

I am either too low or too highly prizd

10   When Elate I am Envy’d, When Meek I’m despis’d



## ********NOTEBOOK POEMS, ***c.*** 1800–1806





When Klopstock England defied  
Uprose terrible Blake in his pride  
For old Nobodaddy aloft  
Farted & Belchd & coughd  
Then swore a great oath that made heavn quake  
And calld aloud to English Blake  
Blake was giving his body ease  
At Lambeth beneath the poplar trees  
From his seat then started he

10       And turnd himself round three times three

The Moon at that sight blushd scarlet red  
The stars threw down their cups & fled  
And all the devils that were in hell  
Answered with a ninefold yell  
Klopstock felt the \[*ninefold*\] intripled turn  
And all his bowels began to \[*burn*\] churn  
\[*They/And*\] And his bowels turned round three times three

And lockd in his soul with a ninefold key  
That from his body it neer could be parted

20       Till to the last trumpet it was farted

Then again old nobodaddy swore  
He neer had seen such a thing before  
Since Noah was shut in the ark  
Since Eve first chose her hell fire spark  
Since twas the fashion to go naked  
Since the old anything was created  
And so feeling he begd him to turn again  
And ease poor Klopstocks nine fold pain  
\[*Then after*\] From pity then he redend round  
And the Spell removed unwound  
\[*If thus Blake could Shite what Klopstock did write*\]  
If Blake could do this when he\[*sat down to*\] rose up from shite

What might he not do if he sat down to write   30



       ON THE VIRGINITY OF THE VIRGIN

       MARY & JOHANNA SOUTHCOTT

Whateer is done to her she cannot know  
And if youll ask her she will swear it so  
Whether tis good or evil none’s to blame  
No one can take the pride no one the shame

Beneath the white thorn lovely May  
\[*Three Virgins at the Break of day*  
*Whither Young Man whither away*\]  
Alas for wo alas for wo alas for wo  
They cry & tears for ever flow  
The one was clothd in flames of fire  
The other clothd in \[*sweet desire*\] Iron wire  
The other clothd in \[*sighs*\] & tears & sighs  
Dazzling bright before my Eyes

10       They bore a Net of Golden twine

To hang upon the branches fine  
\[*Pitying I wept to see the woe*  
*That Love & Beauty undergo*  
*To be consumd in burning fires*  
*And in ungratified desires*\]  
\[*Wings they had \(& when they chose\) that soft inclose*  
*Round their body when they chose*  
*They would let them down at will*  
*Or make translucent*\]

20       And in tears clothd night & day

Melted all my soul away  
When they saw my tears a smile  
That did heaven itself beguile  
Bore the Golden net aloft  
As by downy pinions soft  
Oer the morning of my day  
Underneath the net I stray  
Now intreating flaming fire  
Now intreating \[*sweet desire*\] iron wire

30       Now intreating tears & sighs

\[*When*\] O when will the Morning rise



         THE BIRDS

         He. Where thou dwellest in what Grove

Tell me Fair one tell me love  
Where thou thy charming Nest dost build  
O thou pride of every field



         She. Yonder stands a lonely tree

There I live & mourn for thee  
Morning drinks my silent tear  
And evening winds my sorrows bear



         He. O thou Summers harmony

10                      I have livd & mournd for theeb

Each day I mourn along the wood  
And night hath heard my sorrows loud



         She. Dost thou truly long for me

And am I thus sweet to thee  
Sorrow now is at an End  
O my Lover & my Friend



         He. Come on wings of joy well fly

To where my Bower hangs on high  
Come & make thy calm retreat

20                      Among green leaves & blossoms sweet

\*

I saw a Monk of \[*Constantine*\] Charlemaine  
Arise before my sight  
I talkd to the Grey Monk where he stood  
In beams of infernal light

Gibbon arose with a lash of steel  
And Voltaire with a wracking wheel  
\[*Charlemaine and his barons bold*\]  
The Schools in Clouds of Learning rolld  
Arose with War in iron and gold

\[*Seditious*\] Thou Lazy Monk \[*said Charlemaine*\] they

10             sound afar

\[*The Glory of War thou condemnst in vain*\]  
In vain condemning Glorious War  
And in thy Cell thou shall ever dwell  
Rise War & bind him in his Cell

The blood red ran from the Grey monks side  
His hands & feet were wounded wide  
His body bent his arms & knees  
Like to the roots of ancient trees

I die I die the Mother said

20       My Children will die for lack of bread

What more has the merciless tyrant said  
The Monk sat down on her stony bed

His Eye was dry no tear coud flow  
A hollow groan first spoke his woe  
\[*From his dry tongue these accents flow*\]  
He trembled & shudderd upon the bed  
At length with a feeble cry he said

When God commanded this hand to write  
In the studious hours of deep midnight

30       He told me that All I wrote should prove

The bane of all that on Earth I love

My brother starvd between two walls  
His childrens cry my soul appalls  
\[*But*\] I mockd at the wrack & griding chain  
My bent body mocks at their torturing pain

Thy father drew his sword in the north  
With his thousands strong he is marched forth  
Thy brother has armd himself in steel  
To revenge the wrongs thy Children feel

But vain the sword & vain the bow  
They never can work wars overthrow  
The Hermits prayer & the widows tear  
Alone can free the world from fear

The hand of vengeance sought the bed  
To which the purple tyrant fled  
The iron hand crushd the tyrants head  
\[*And usurpd the tyrants throne and bed*\]  
And became a tyrant in his stead

Untill the Tyrant himself relent

50       The Tyrant who first the black bow bent

Slaughter shall heap the bloody plain  
Resistance & war is the Tyrants gain

But the Tear of Love & forgiveness sweet  
And submission to death beneath his feet  
The Tear shall melt the sword of steel  
And every wound it has made shall heal

\[*For the tear is an intellectual thing*\]  
And a sigh is the Sword of an Angel King  
And the bitter groan \[*for anothers*\] of the Martyrs woe

60         Is an arrow from the Almighties bow.

                       \[Additional Stanzas\]

When Satan first the black bow bent  
And the Moral Law from the Gospel rent  
He forg’d the Law into a Sword  
And spilld the blood of Mercys Lord

\[*O Charlemaine O Charlemaine*\]  
Titus. Constantine Charlemaine  
O Voltaire Rousseau Gibbon vain  
Your \[*mocks* & *scorn*\] Grecian mocks & Roman Sword  
Against this image of his Lord

70       A tear is an &c

Gibbon plied his lash of steel  
Voltaire turnd his wracking wheel  
Charlemaine & his barons bold  
Stood by & mockd in iron & gold

The Wheel of Voltaire whirld on high  
Gibbon aloud his lash does ply  
Charlemaine & his clouds of War  
Muster around the Polar Bar

A Grecian Scoff is a wracking wheel

80       The Roman pride is a sword of steel

\[*Vict*\] Glory & Victory a \[*plaited*\] Phallic Whip

\*

MORNING

To find the Western path  
Right thro the Gates of Wrath  
I urge my way  
Sweet Mercy leads me on  
With soft repentant moan  
I see the break of day

The war of swords & spears  
Melted by dewy tears  
Exhales on high

10       The Sun is freed from fears

And with soft grateful tears  
Ascends the sky

\*

Terror in the house does roar  
But Pity stands before the door

\*

\[*This world*\] Each Man is in \[*the*\] His Spectres power  
Untill the arrival of that hour  
\[*Untill the*\] When his Humanity awake  
And Cast \[*the*\] his own Spectre into the Lake

And there to Eternity aspire  
The selfhood in a flame of fire  
Till then the Lamb of God

\*

Mock on Mock on Voltaire Rousseau  
Mock on Mock on tis all in vain  
You throw the sand against the wind  
And the wind blows it back again

And every sand becomes a Gem  
Reflected in the beams divine  
Blown back they blind the mocking Eye  
But still in Israels paths they shine

The Atoms of Democritus

10       And Newtons Particles of light

Are sands upon the Red sea shore  
Where Israels tents do shine so bright

\*

My Spectre around me night & day  
Like a Wild beast guards my way  
My Emanation far within  
Weeps incessantly for my Sin

\[\(*Her*\) *Thy weeping* \(*She*\) *thou shall neer give oer  
I Sin against* \(*her*\) *thee more & more  
And never will from sin be free  
Till she forgives & comes to me*

*Thou hast parted from my side  
Once thou wast a virgin bride  
Never shalt thou a* \(*lover*\) *true love find  
My Spectre follows thee Behind*\]

\[*In a dark cold winter night*\]  
\[*A deep winter* \(*night*\) *dark & cold  
Within my* \(*loves*\) *Heart thou didst unfold  
A Fathomless & boundless Deep  
There we wander there we weep*

*When my Love did first begin  
Thou didst call that Love a Sin*

20       *Secret trembling night & day*

*Driving all my Loves away*\]

A Fathomless & boundless deep  
There we wander there we weep  
On the hungry craving wind  
My Spectre follows thee behind

He scents thy footsteps in the snow  
Wheresoever thou dost go  
Thro the wintry hail & rain  
When wilt thou return again

30       \[*Didst*\] Dost thou not in Pride & Scorn

Fill with tempests all my morn  
And with jealousies & fears  
Fill my pleasant nights with tears

Seven of my sweet loves thy knife  
Has bereaved of their life  
Their marble tombs I built with tears  
And with cold & shuddering fears

Seven more loves weep night & day  
Round the tombs where my loves lay

40       And seven more loves attend each night

Around my couch with torches bright

And seven more Loves in my bed  
Crown with wine my mournful head  
Pitying & forgiving all  
Thy transgressions great & small

When wilt thou return & view  
My loves & them to life renew  
When wilt thou return & live  
When wilt thou pity \[&\] as I forgive

50       Never Never I return

Still for Victory I burn  
Living thee alone Ill have  
And when dead Ill be thy Grave

Thro the Heaven & Earth & Hell  
Thou shalt never never quell  
I will fly & thou pursue  
Night & Morn the flight renew

Till \[*thou*\] I turn from Female Love  
And \[*dig*\] root up the Infernal Grove

60       \[*Thou shalt*\] I shall never worthy be

To Step into Eternity

And \[*I*\] to end thy cruel mocks  
Annihilate \[*them*\] thee on the rocks  
And another form create  
To be subservient to my Fate

Let us agree to give up Love  
And root up the infernal grove  
Then shall we return & see  
The worlds of happy Eternity

70       & Throughout all Eternity

xI forgive you you forgive me  
As our Dear Redeemer said  
This the Wine & this the Bread

                                \[Additional Stanzas\]

Oer \[*thy*\] my Sins Thou sit & moan  
\[*Have I*\] Hast thou no sins of \[*my*\] thy own  
Oer \[*thy*\] my Sins \[I\] thou sit & weep  
And lull \[*my*\] thy own Sins fast asleep

What transgressions I commit  
Are for thy Transgressions fit

80       They thy Harlots thou their Slave

And my Bed becomes their Grave

Poor pale pitiable form  
That I follow in a Storm  
Iron tears & groans of lead  
Bind around my akeing head

And let us go to the highest downs  
With many pleasing wiles  
The Woman that does not love your Frowns  
Will never embrace your smiles

\*

The Hebrew Nation did not write it  
Avarice & Chastity did shite it

\*

Grown old in Love from Seven till Seven times Seven  
I oft have wishd for Hell for Ease from Heaven

\*

A Woman Scaly & a Man all Hairy  
Is such a Match as he who dares  
Will find the Womans Scales scrape off the Mans Hairs



## **********POEMS FROM THE  
PICKERING MANUSCRIPT**





THE SMILE

There is a Smile of Love  
And there is a Smile of Deceit  
And there is a Smile of Smiles  
In which these two Smiles meet

And there is a Frown of Hate  
And there is a Frown of disdain  
And there is a Frown of Frowns  
Which you strive to forget in vain

For it sticks in the Hearts deep Core

10    And it sticks in the deep Back bone

And no Smile that ever was smild  
But only one Smile alone

That betwixt the Cradle & Grave  
It only once Smild can be  
But when it once is Smild  
Theres an end to all Misery



### **THE GOLDEN NET**

Three Virgins at the break of day  
Whither young Man whither away  
Alas for woe\! alas for woe\!  
They cry & tears for ever flow  
The one was Clothd in flames of fire  
The other Clothd in iron wire  
The other Clothd in tears & sighs  
Dazling bright before my Eyes

They bore a Net of Golden twine

10    To hang upon the Branches fine

Pitying I wept to see the woe  
That Love & Beauty undergo  
To be consumd in burning Fires  
And in ungratified desires  
And in tears clothd Night & day  
Melted all my Soul away  
When they saw my Tears a Smile  
That did Heaven itself beguile  
Bore the Golden Net aloft

20    As on downy Pinions soft

Over the Morning of my day  
Underneath the Net I stray  
Now intreating Burning Fire  
Now intreating Iron Wire  
Now intreating Tears & Sighs  
O when will the morning rise



### **THE MENTAL TRAVELLER**

I traveld thro’ a Land of Men  
A Land of Men & Women too  
And heard & saw such dreadful things  
As cold Earth wanderers never knew

For there the Babe is born in joy  
That was begotten in dire woe  
Just as we Reap in joy the fruit  
Which we in bitter tears did sow

And if the Babe is born a Boy

10    He’s given to a Woman Old

Who nails him down upon a rock  
Catches his shrieks in cups of gold

She binds iron thorns around his head  
She pierces both his hands & feet  
She cuts his heart out at his side  
To make it feel both cold & heat

Her fingers number every Nerve  
Just as a Miser counts his gold  
She lives upon his shrieks & cries

20    And she grows young as he grows old

Till he becomes a bleeding youth  
And she becomes a Virgin bright  
Then he rends up his Manacles  
And binds her down for his delight

He plants himself in all her Nerves  
Just as a Husbandman his mould  
And she becomes his dwelling place  
And Garden fruitful seventy fold

An aged Shadow soon he fades

30    Wandring round an Earthly Cot

Full filled all with gems & gold  
Which he by industry had got

And these are the gems of the Human Soul  
The rubies & pearls of a lovesick eye  
The countless gold of the akeing heart  
The martyrs groan & the lovers sigh

They are his meat they are his drink  
He feeds the Beggar & the Poor  
And the wayfaring Traveller

40    For ever open is his door

His grief is their eternal joy  
They make the roofs & walls to ring  
Till from the fire on the hearth  
A little Female Babe does spring

And she is all of solid fire  
And gems & gold that none his hand  
Dares stretch to touch her Baby form  
Or wrap her in his swaddling-band

But She comes to the Man she loves

50    If young or old or rich or poor

They soon drive out the aged Host  
A Beggar at anothers door

He wanders weeping far away  
Untill some other take him in  
Oft blind & age-bent sore distrest  
Untill he can a Maiden win

And to allay his freezing Age  
The Poor Man takes her in his arms  
The Cottage fades before his sight

60    The Garden & its lovely Charms

The Guests are scatterd thro’ the land  
For the Eye altering alters all  
The Senses roll themselves in fear  
And the flat Earth becomes a Ball

The Stars Sun Moon all shrink away  
A desart vast without a bound  
And nothing left to eat or drink  
And a dark desart all around

The honey of her Infant lips

70    The bread & wine of her sweet smile

The wild game of her roving Eye  
Does him to Infancy beguile

For as he eats & drinks he grows  
Younger & younger every day  
And on the desart wild they both  
Wander in terror & dismay

Like the wild Stag she flees away  
Her fear plants many a thicket wild  
While he pursues her night & day

80     By various arts of Love beguild

By various arts of Love & Hate  
Till the wide desart planted oer  
With Labyrinths of wayward Love  
Where roams the Lion Wolf & Boar

Till he becomes a wayward Babe  
And she a weeping Woman Old  
Then many a Lover wanders here  
The Sun & Stars are nearer rolld

The trees bring forth sweet Extacy

90    To all who in the desart roam

Till many a City there is Built  
And many a pleasant Shepherds home

But when they find the frowning Babe  
Terror strikes thro the region wide  
They cry the Babe the Babe is Born  
And flee away on Every side

For who dare touch the frowning form  
His arm is witherd to its root  
Lions Boars Wolves all howling flee

100  And every Tree does shed its fruit

And none can touch that frowning form  
Except it be a Woman Old  
She nails him down upon the Rock  
And all is done as I have told



### **THE LAND OF DREAMS**

Awake awake my little Boy  
Thou wast thy Mothers only joy  
Why dost thou weep in thy gentle sleep  
Awake thy Father does thee keep

O what Land is the Land of Dreams  
What are its Mountains & what are its Streams  
O Father I saw my Mother there  
Among the Lillies by waters fair

Among the Lambs clothed in white

10    She walkd with her Thomas in sweet delight

I wept for joy like a dove I mourn  
O when shall I again return

Dear Child I also by pleasant Streams  
Have wanderd all Night in the Land of Dreams  
But tho calm & warm the waters wide  
I could not get to the other side

Father O Father what do we here  
In this Land of unbelief & fear  
The Land of Dreams is better far

20    Above the light of the Morning Star



### **MARY**

Sweet Mary the first time she ever was there  
Came into the Ball room among the Fair  
The young Men & Maidens around her throng  
And these are the words upon every tongue

An Angel is here from the heavenly Climes  
Or again does return the Golden times  
Her eyes outshine every brilliant ray  
She opens her lips tis the Month of May

Mary moves in soft beauty & conscious delight

10    To augment with sweet smiles all the joys of the Night

Nor once blushes to own to the rest of the Fair  
That sweet Love & Beauty are worthy our care

In the Morning the Villagers rose with delight  
And repeated with pleasure the joys of the night  
And Mary arose among Friends to be free  
But no Friend from henceforward thou Mary shalt see

Some said she was proud some calld her a whore  
And some when she passed by shut to the door  
A damp cold came oer her her blushes all fled

20    Her lillies & roses are blighted & shed

O why was I born with a different Face  
Why was I not born like this Envious Race  
Why did Heaven adorn me with bountiful hand  
And then set me down in an envious Land

To be weak as a Lamb & smooth as a dove  
And not to raise Envy is calld Christian Love  
But if you raise Envy your Merits to blame  
For planting such spite in the weak & the tame

I will humble my Beauty I will not dress fine

30    I will keep from the Ball & my Eyes shall not shine

And if any Girls Lover forsakes her for me  
I’ll refuse him my hand & from Envy be free

She went out in Morning attird plain & neat  
Proud Marys gone Mad said the Child in the Street  
She went out in Morning in plain neat attire  
And came home in Evening bespatterd with mire

She trembled & wept sitting on the Bed side  
She forgot it was Night & she trembled & cried  
She forgot it was Night she forgot it was Morn

40    Her soft Memory imprinted with Faces of Scorn

With Faces of Scorn & with Eyes of disdain  
Like foul Fiends inhabiting Marys mild Brain  
She remembers no Face like the Human Divine  
All Faces have Envy sweet Mary but thine

And thine is a Face of sweet Love in Despair  
And thine is a Face of mild sorrow & care  
And thine is a Face of wild terror & fear  
That shall never be quiet till laid on its bier



### **THE CRYSTAL CABINET**

The Maiden caught me in the Wild  
Where I was dancing merrily  
She put me into her Cabinet  
And Lockd me up with a golden Key

This Cabinet is formd of Gold  
And Pearl & Crystal shining bright  
And within it opens into a World  
And a little lovely Moony Night

Another England there I saw

10    Another London with its Tower

Another Thames & other Hills  
And another pleasant Surrey Bower

Another Maiden like herself  
Translucent lovely shining clear  
Threefold each in the other closd  
O what a pleasant trembling fear

O what a smile a threefold Smile  
Filld me that like a flame I burnd  
I bent to Kiss the lovely Maid

20    And found a Threefold Kiss returnd

I strove to sieze the inmost Form  
With ardor fierce & hands of flame  
But burst the Crystal Cabinet  
And like a Weeping Babe became

A weeping Babe upon the wild  
And Weeping Woman pale reclind  
And in the outward air again  
I filld with woes the passing Wind



### **THE GREY MONK**

I die I die the Mother said  
My Children die for lack of Bread  
What more has the merciless Tyrant said  
The Monk sat down on the Stony Bed

The blood red ran from the Grey Monks side  
His hands & feet were wounded wide  
His Body bent his arms & knees  
Like to the roots of ancient trees

His eye was dry no tear could flow

10    A hollow groan first spoke his woe

He trembled & shudderd upon the Bed  
At length with a feeble cry he said

When God commanded this hand to write  
In the studious hours of deep midnight  
He told me the writing I wrote should prove  
The Bane of all that on Earth I lovd

My Brother starvd between two Walls  
His Childrens Cry my Soul appalls  
I mockd at the wrack & griding chain

20    My bent body mocks their torturing pain

Thy Father drew his sword in the North  
With his thousands strong he marched forth  
Thy Brother has armd himself in Steel  
To avenge the wrongs thy Children feel

But vain the Sword & vain the Bow  
They never can work Wars overthrow  
The Hermits Prayer & the Widows tear  
Alone can free the World from fear

For a Tear is an Intellectual Thing

30    And a Sigh is the Sword of an Angel King

And the bitter groan of the Martyrs woe  
Is an Arrow from the Almighties Bow

The hand of Vengeance found the Bed  
To which the Purple Tyrant fled  
The iron hand crushd the Tyrants head  
And became a Tyrant in his stead



### **AUGURIES OF INNOCENCE**

To see a World in a Grain of Sand  
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower  
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand  
And Eternity in an hour

A Robin Red breast in a Cage  
Puts all Heaven in a Rage  
A dove house filld with doves & Pigeons  
Shudders Hell thro all its regions  
A dog starvd at his Masters Gate

10    Predicts the ruin of the State

A Horse misusd upon the Road  
Calls to Heaven for Human blood  
Each outcry of the hunted Hare  
A fibre from the Brain does tear  
A Skylark wounded in the wing  
A Cherubim does cease to sing  
The Game Cock clipd & armd for fight  
Does the Rising Sun affright  
Every Wolfs & Lions howl

20    Raises from Hell a Human Soul

The wild deer wandring here & there  
Keeps the Human Soul from Care  
The Lamb misusd breeds Public strife  
And yet forgives the Butchers Knife  
The Bat that flits at close of Eve  
Has left the Brain that wont Believe  
The Owl that calls upon the Night  
Speaks the Unbelievers fright  
He who shall hurt the little Wren

30    Shall never be belovd by Men

He who the Ox to wrath has movd  
Shall never be by Woman lovd  
The wanton Boy that kills the Fly  
Shall feel the Spiders enmity  
He who torments the Chafers sprite  
Weaves a Bower in endless Night  
The Catterpiller on the Leaf  
Repeats to thee thy Mothers grief  
Kill not the Moth nor Butterfly

40    For the Last Judgment draweth nigh

He who shall train the Horse to War  
Shall never pass the Polar Bar

The Beggers Dog & Widows Cat  
Feed them & thou wilt grow fat  
The Gnat that sings his Summers song  
Poison gets from Slanders tongue  
The poison of the Snake & Newt  
Is the sweat of Envys Foot  
The Poison of the Honey Bee

50    Is the Artists Jealousy

The Princes Robes & Beggars Rags  
Are Toadstools on the Misers Bags  
A truth thats told with bad intent  
Beats all the Lies you can invent  
It is right it should be so  
Man was made for Joy & Woe  
And when this we rightly know  
Thro the World we safely go  
Joy & Woe are woven fine

60    A Clothing for the Soul divine

Under every grief & pine  
Runs a joy with silken twine  
The Babe is more than swadling Bands  
Throughout all these Human Lands  
Tools were made & Born were hands  
Every Farmer Understands  
Every Tear from Every Eye  
Becomes a Babe in Eternity  
This is caught by Females bright

70    And returnd to its own delight

The Bleat the Bark Bellow & Roar  
Are Waves that Beat on Heavens Shore  
The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath  
Writes Revenge in realms of death  
The Beggars Rags fluttering in Air  
Does to Rags the Heavens tear  
The Soldier armd with Sword & Gun  
Palsied strikes the Summers Sun  
The poor Mans Farthing is worth more

80    Than all the Gold on Africs Shore

One Mite wrung from the Labrers hands  
Shall buy & sell the Misers Lands  
Or if protected from on high  
Does that whole Nation sell & buy  
He who mocks the Infants Faith  
Shall be mock’d in Age & Death  
He who shall teach the Child to Doubt  
The rotting Grave shall neer get out  
He who respects the Infants faith

90    Triumphs over Hell & Death

The Childs Toys & the Old Mans Reasons  
Are the Fruits of the Two seasons  
The Questioner who sits so sly  
Shall never know how to Reply  
He who replies to words of Doubt  
Doth put the Light of Knowledge out  
The Strongest Poison ever known  
Came from Caesars Laurel Crown  
Nought can deform the Human Race

100  Like to the Armours iron brace

When Gold & Gems adorn the Plow  
To peaceful Arts shall Envy Bow  
A Riddle or the Crickets Cry  
Is to Doubt a fit Reply  
The Emmets Inch & Eagles Mile  
Make Lame Philosophy to smile  
He who Doubts from what he sees  
Will neer Believe do what you Please  
If the Sun & Moon should doubt

110  Theyd immediately Go out

To be in a Passion you Good may do  
But no Good if a Passion is in you  
The Whore & Gambler by the State  
Licencd build that Nations Fate  
The Harlots cry from Street to Street  
Shall weave Old Englands winding Sheet  
The Winners Shout the Losers Curse  
Dance before dead Englands Hearse

Every Night & every Morn

120  Some to Misery are Born

Every Morn & every Night  
Some are Born to sweet delight  
Some are Born to sweet delight  
Some are Born to Endless Night  
We are led to Believe a Lie  
When we see \[*with*\] not Thro the Eye  
Which was Born in a Night to perish in a Night  
When the Soul Slept in Beams of Light  
God Appears & God is Light

130  To those poor Souls who dwell in Night

But does a Human Form Display  
To those who Dwell in Realms of day



### **LONG JOHN BROWN & LITTLE MARY BELL**

\[*Pretty*\] Little Mary Bell had a Fairy in a Nut  
\[*Young*\] Long John Brown had the Devil in his Gut  
\[*Young*\] Long John Brown lovd \[*Pretty*\] Little Mary Bell  
And the Fairy drew the Devil into the Nut-shell

Her Fairy skipd out & her Fairy skipd in  
He laughd at the devil saying Love is a Sin  
The devil he raged & the devil he was wroth  
And the devil enterd into the Young Mans broth

He was soon in the Gut of the loving Young Swain

10    For John eat & drank to drive away Loves pain

But all he could do he grew thinner & thinner  
Tho he eat & drank as much as ten Men for his dinner

Some said he had a Wolf in his stomach day & night  
Some said he had the devil & they guessd right  
The fairy skipd about in his glory Joy & Pride  
And he laughd at the devil till poor John Brown died

Then the Fairy skipd out of the old Nut shell  
And woe & alack for Pretty Mary Bell  
For the Devil crept in when the Fairy skipd out

20    And there goes Miss Bell with her fusty old Nut



### ******WILLIAM BOND**

I wonder whether the Girls are mad  
And I wonder whether they mean to kill  
And I wonder if William Bond will die  
For assuredly he is very ill

He went to Church in a May morning  
Attended by Fairies one two & three  
But the Angels of Providence drove them away  
And he returnd home in Misery

He went not out to the Field nor Fold

10    He went not out to the Village nor Town

But he came home in a black black Cloud  
And took to his Bed & there lay down

And an Angel of Providence at his Feet  
And an Angel of Providence at his Head  
And in the midst a Black Black Cloud  
And in the midst the Sick Man on his Bed

And on his Right hand was Mary Green  
And on his Left hand was his Sister Jane  
And their tears fell thro the black black Cloud

20    To drive away the sick mans pain

O William if thou dost another Love  
Dost another Love better than poor Mary  
Go & take that other to be thy Wife  
And Mary Green shall her Servant be

Yes Mary I do another Love  
Another I Love far better than thee  
And Another I will have for my Wife  
Then what have I to do with thee

For thou art Melancholy Pale

30    And on thy Head is the cold Moons shine

But she is ruddy & bright as day  
And the sun beams dazzle from her eyne

Mary trembled & Mary chilld  
And Mary fell down on the right hand floor  
That William Bond & his Sister Jane  
Scarce could recover Mary more

When Mary woke & found her Laid  
On the Right hand of her William dear  
On the Right hand of his loved Bed

40    And saw her William Bond so near

The Fairies that fled from William Bond  
Danced around her Shining Head  
They danced over the Pillow white  
And the Angels of Providence left the Bed

I thought Love livd in the hot sun shine  
But O he lives in the Moony light  
I thought to find Love in the heat of day  
But sweet Love is the Comforter of Night

Seek Love in the Pity of others Woe

50    In the gentle relief of anothers care

In the darkness of night & the winters snow  
In the naked & outcast Seek Love there

To Justify the Ways of God to Men





PLATE 1



PREFACE

The Stolen and Perverted Writings of Homer & Ovid: of Plato & Cicero. which all Men ought to contemn: are set up by artifice against the Sublime of the Bible. but when the New Age is at leisure to Pronounce: all will be set right: & those Grand Works of the more ancient & consciously & professedly Inspired Men, will hold their proper rank, & the Daughters of Memory shall become the Daughters of Inspiration. Shakspeare & Milton were both curbd by the general malady & infection from the

10    silly Greek & Latin slaves of the Sword.

Rouze up O Young Men of the New Age\! set your foreheads against the ignorant Hirelings\! For we have Hirelings in the Camp, the Court & the University: who would if they could, for ever depress Mental & prolong Corporeal War. Painters\! on you I call\! Sculptors\! Architects\! Suffer not the fash\[i\]onable Fools to depress your powers by the prices they pretend to give for contemptible works or the expensive advertizing boasts that they make of such works; believe Christ & his Apostles that there is a Class of Men whose whole delight is in Destroying.

20    We do not want either Greek or Roman Models if we are but just & true

to our own Imaginations, those Worlds of Eternity in which we shall live for ever; in Jesus our Lord.

And did those feet in ancient time.  
Walk upon Englands mountains green:  
And was the holy Lamb of God,  
On Englands pleasant pastures seen\!

And did the Countenance Divine,  
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?  
And was Jerusalem builded here,  
Among these dark Satanic Mills?

Bring me my Bow of burning gold:

10    Bring me my Arrows of desire:

Bring me my Spear: O clouds unfold\!  
Bring me my Chariot of fire\!

I will not cease from Mental Fight,  
Nor shall my Sword sleep in my hand:  
Till we have built Jerusalem,  
In Englands green & pleasant Land.

Would to God that all the Lords people were Prophets.

Numbers XI. ch 29 v.



PLATE 2

MILTON

BOOK THE FIRST

Daughters of Beulah\! Muses who inspire the Poets Song

Record the journey of immortal Milton thro’ your Realms

Of terror & mild moony lustre, in soft sexual delusions

Of varied beauty, to delight the wanderer and repose

His burning thirst & freezing hunger\! Come into my hand

By your mild power; descending down the Nerves of my right arm

From out the Portals of my Brain, where by your ministry

The Eternal Great Humanity Divine, planted his Paradise,

And in it caus’d the Spectres of the Dead to take sweet forms

10    In likeness of himself. Tell also of the False Tongue\! vegetated

Beneath your land of shadows: of its sacrifices. and

Its offerings; even till Jesus, the image of the Invisible God

Became its prey; a curse, an offering, and an atonement,

For Death Eternal in the heavens of Albion, & before the Gates

Of Jerusalem his Emanation, in the heavens beneath Beulah

Say first\! what mov’d Milton, who walkd about in Eternity

One hundred years, pondring the intricate mazes of Providence

Unhappy tho in heav’n, he obey’d, he murmur’d not. he was silent

Viewing his Sixfold Emanation scatter’d thro’ the deep

20    In torment\! To go into the deep her to redeem & himself perish?

What cause at length mov’d Milton to this unexampled deed?

A Bards prophetic Song\! for sitting at eternal tables, Terrific among the Sons of Albion in chorus solemn & loud

A Bard broke forth\! all sat attentive to the awful man.

Mark well my words\! they are of your eternal salvation:

Three Classes are Created by the Hammer of Los, & Woven

PLATE 3

By Enitharmons Looms when Albion was slain upon his Mountains

And in his Tent, thro envy of Living Form, even of the Divine Vision

And of the sports of Wisdom in the Human Imagination

Which is the Divine Body of the Lord Jesus. blessed for ever.

Mark well my words. they are of your eternal salvation:

Urizen lay in darkness & solitude, in chains of the mind lock’d up

Los siezd his Hammer & Tongs; he labourd at his resolute Anvil

Among indefinite Druid rocks & snows of doubt & reasoning.

Refusing all Definite Form, the Abstract Horror roofd. stony hard

10    And a first Age passed over & a State of dismal woe:

Down sunk with fright a red round Globe hot burning. deep

Deep down into the Abyss. panting: conglobing: trembling

And a second Age passed over & a State of dismal woe.

Rolling round into two little Orbs & closed in two little Caves

The Eyes beheld the Abyss: lest bones of solidness freeze over all

And a third Age passed over & a State of dismal woe.

From beneath his Orbs of Vision, Two Ears in close volutions

Shot spiring out in the deep darkness & petrified as they grew

And a fourth Age passed over & a State of dismal woe.



20    Hanging upon the wind, Two Nostrils bent down into the Deep

And a fifth Age passed over & a State of dismal woe.

In ghastly torment sick, a Tongue of hunger & thirst flamed out

And a sixth Age passed over & a State of dismal woe.

Enraged & stifled without & within: in terror & woe, he threw his

Right Arm to the north, his left Arm to the south, & his Feet

Stampd the nether Abyss in trembling & howling & dismay

And a seventh Age passed over & a State of dismal woe

Terrified Los stood in the Abyss & his immortal limbs

Grew deadly pale; he became what he beheld: for a red

30    Round Globe sunk down from his Bosom into the Deep in pangs

He hoverd over it trembling & weeping. suspended it shook

The nether Abyss in tremblings, he wept over it, he cherish’d it

In deadly sickening pain: till separated into a Female pale

As the cloud that brings the snow: all the while from his Back

A blue fluid exuded in Sinews hardening in the Abyss

Till it separated into a Male Form howling in Jealousy

Within labouring. beholding Without: from Particulars to Generals

Subduing his Spectre, they Builded the Looms of Generation

They Builded Great Golgonooza Times on Times Ages on Ages

40    First Orc was Born then the Shadowy Female: then All Los’s Family

At last Enitharmon brought forth Satan Refusing Form, in vain

The Miller of Eternity made subservient to the Great Harvest

That he may go to his own Place Prince of the Starry Wheels

PLATE 4

Beneath the Plow of Rintrah & the Harrow of the Almighty

In the hands of Palamabron. Where the Starry Mills of Satan

Are built beneath the Earth & Waters of the Mundane Shell

Here the Three Classes of Men take their Sexual texture Woven

The Sexual is Threefold: the Human is Fourfold.

If you account it Wisdom when you are angry to be silent, and

Not to shew it: I do not account that Wisdom but Folly.

Every Mans Wisdom is peculiar to his own Individ\[u\]ality

O Satan my youngest born, art thou not Prince of the Starry Hosts

10    And of the Wheels of Heaven, to turn the Mills day & night?

Art thou not Newtons Pantocrator weaving the Woof of Locke

To Mortals thy Mills seem every thing & the Harrow of Shaddai

A scheme of Human conduct invisible & incomprehensible

Get to thy Labours at the Mills & leave me to my wrath.

Satan was going to reply, but Los roll’d his loud thunders.

Anger me not\! thou canst not drive the Harrow in pitys paths.

Thy Work is Eternal Death, with Mills & Ovens & Cauldrons.

Trouble me no more. thou canst not have Eternal Life

So Los spoke\! Satan trembling obeyd weeping along the way.

20    Mark well my words, they are of your eternal Salvation

Between South Molton Street & Stratford Place: Calvarys foot

Where the Victims were preparing for Sacrifice their Cherubim

Around their loins pourd forth their arrows & their bosoms beam

With all colours of precious stones, & their inmost palaces

Resounded with preparation of animals wild & tame

\(Mark well my words\! Corporeal Friends are Spiritual Enemies\)

Mocking Druidical Mathematical Proportion of Length Bredth Highth

Displaying Naked Beauty\! with Flute & Harp & Song

PLATE 5

Palamabron with the fiery Harrow in morning returning

From breathing fields. Satan fainted beneath the artillery

Christ took on Sin in the Virgins Womb, & put it off on the Cross

All pitied the piteous & was wrath with the wrathful & Los heard it.

And this is the manner of the Daughters of Albion in their beauty

Every one is threefold in Head & Heart & Reins, & every one

Has three Gates into the Three Heavens of Beulah which shine

Translucent in their Foreheads & their Bosoms & their Loins

Surrounded with fires unapproachable: but whom they please

10    They take up into their Heavens in intoxicating delight

For the Elect cannot be Redeemd, but Created continually

By Offering & Atonement in the crue\[l\]ties of Moral Law

Hence the three Classes of Men take their fix’d destinations

They are the Two Contraries & the Reasoning Negative.

While the Females prepare the Victims, the Males at Furnaces

And Anvils dance the dance of tears & pain: loud lightnings

Lash on their limbs as they turn the whirlwinds loose upon

The Furnaces, lamenting around the Anvils & this their Song

Ah weak & wide astray: Ah shut in narrow doleful form

20    Creeping in reptile flesh upon the bosom of the ground

The Eye of Man a little narrow orb closd up & dark

Scarcely beholding the great light conversing with the Void

The Ear, a little shell in small volutions shutting out

All melodies & comprehending only Discord and Harmony

The Tongue a little moisture fills, a little food it cloys

A little sound it utters & its cries are faintly heard

Then brings forth Moral Virtue the cruel Virgin Babylon

Can such an Eye judge of the stars? & looking thro its tubes

Measure the sunny rays that point their spears on Udanadan

30    Can such an Ear filld with the vapours of the yawning pit.

Judge of the pure melodious harp struck by a hand divine?

Can such closed Nostrils feel a joy? or tell of autumn fruits

When grapes & figs burst their covering to the joyful air

Can such a Tongue boast of the living waters? or take in

Ought but the Vegetable Ratio & loathe the faint delight

Can such gross Lips percieve? alas\! folded within themselves

They touch not ought but pallid turn & tremble at every wind

Thus they sing Creating the Three Classes among Druid Rocks

Charles calls on Milton for Atonement. Cromwell is ready

40    James calls for fires in Golgonooza. for heaps of smoking ruins

In the night of prosperity and wantonness which he himself Created

Among the Daughters of Albion among the Rocks of the Druids

When Satan fainted beneath the arrows of Elynittria

And Mathematic Proportion was subdued by Living Proportion

PLATE 6

From Golgonooza the spiritual Four-fold London eternal

In immense labours & sorrows, ever building, ever falling,

Thro Albions four Forests which overspread all the Earth,

From London Stone to Blackheath east: to Hounslow west:

To Finchley north: to Norwood south: and the weights

Of Enitharmons Loom play lulling cadences on the winds of Albion

From Caithness in the north, to Lizard-point & Dover in the south

Loud sounds the Hammer of Los, & loud his Bellows is heard

Before London to Hampsteads breadths & Highgates heights To

10    Stratford & old Bow: & across to the Gardens of Kensington

On Tyburns Brook: loud groans Thames beneath the iron Forge

Of Rintrah & Palamabron of Theotorm\[on\] & Bromion, to forge the instruments

Of Harvest: the Plow & Harrow to pass over the Nations

The Surrey hills glow like the clinkers of the furnace: Lambeths Vale

Where Jerusalems foundations began; where they were laid in ruins

Where they were laid in ruins from every Nation & Oak Groves rooted

Dark gleams before the Furnace-mouth a heap of burning ashes

When shall Jerusalem return & overspread all the Nations

Return: return to Lambeths Vale O building of human souls

20    Thence stony Druid Temples overspread the Island white

And thence from Jerusalem ruins. from her walls of salvation

And praise: thro the whole Earth were reard from Ireland

To Mexico & Peru west, & east to China & Japan; till Babel

The Spectre of Albion frownd over the Nations in glory & war

All things begin & end in Albions ancient Druid rocky shore

But now the Starry Heavens are fled from the mighty limbs of Albion

Loud sounds the Hammer of Los, loud turn the Wheels of Enitharmon

Her Looms vibrate with soft affections, weaving the Web of Life

Out from the ashes of the Dead; Los lifts his iron Ladles

30    With molten ore: he heaves the iron cliffs in his rattling chains

From Hyde Park to the Alms-houses of Mile-end & old Bow

Here the Three Classes of Mortal Men take their fixd destinations

And hence they overspread the Nations of the whole Earth & hence

The Web of Life is woven: & the tender sinews of life created

And the Three Classes of Men regulated by Los’s Hammer.

PLATE 7

The first, The Elect from before the foundation of the World:

The second, The Redeem’d. The Third, The Reprobate & form’d

To destruction from the mothers womb: follow with me my plow:

Of the first class was Satan: with incomparable mildness;

His primitive tyrannical attempts on Los: with most endearing love

He soft intreated Los to give to him Palamabrons station;

For Palamabron returnd with labour wearied every evening

Palamabron oft refus’d; and as often Satan offer’d

His service till by repeated offers and repeated intreaties

10    Los gave to him the Harrow of the Almighty; alas blamable

Palamabron fear’d to be angry lest Satan should accuse him of

Ingratitude, & Los believe the accusation thro Satans extreme

Mildness. Satan labour’d all day. it was a thousand years

In the evening returning terrified overlabourd & astonish’d

Embrac’d soft with a brothers tears Palamabron, who also wept

Mark well my words\! they are of your eternal salvation

Next morning Palamabron rose: the horses of the Harrow

Were maddend with tormenting fury, & the servants of the Harrow

The Gnomes, accus’d Satan, with indignation fury and fire.

20    Then Palamabron reddening like the Moon in an eclipse,

Spoke saying, You know Satans mildness and his self-imposition,

Seeming a brother, being a tyrant, even thinking himself a brother

While he is murdering the just; prophetic I behold

His future course thro’ darkness and despair to eternal death

But we must not be tyrants also: he hath assum’d my place

For one whole day, under pretence of pity and love to me:

My horses hath he maddend: and my fellow servants injur’d:

How should he\[,\] he\[,\] know the duties of another? O foolish for bearance

Would I had told Los, all my heart\! but patience O my friends,

30    All may be well: silent remain, while I call Los and Satan.

Loud as the wind of Beulah that unroots the rocks & hills

Palamabron call’d: and Los & Satan came before him

And Palamabron shew’d the horses & the servants. Satan wept,

And mildly cursing Palamabron, him accus’d of crimes

Himself had wrought. Los trembled; Satans blandishments almost

Perswaded the Prophet of Eternity that Palamabron

Was Satans enemy, & that the Gnomes being Palamabron’s friends

Were leagued together against Satan thro’ ancient enmity.

What could Los do? how could he judge, when Satans self, believ’d

40    That he had not oppres’d the horses of the Harrow, nor the servants.

So Los said, Henceforth Palamabron, let each his own station

Keep: nor in pity false, nor in officious brotherhood, where

None needs, be active. Mean time Palamabrons horses.

Rag’d with thick flames redundant, & the Harrow maddend with fury.

Trembling Palamabron stood, the strongest of Demons trembled:

Curbing his living creatures; many of the strongest Gnomes,

They bit in their wild fury, who also madden’d like wildest beasts

Mark well my words; they are of your eternal salvation

PLATE 8

Mean while wept Satan before Los, accusing Palamabron;

Himself exculpating with mildest speech. for himself believ’d

That he had not opress’d nor injur’d the refractory servants.

But Satan returning to his Mills \(for Palamabron had serv’d

The Mills of Satan as the easier task\) found all confusion

And back return’d to Los, not fill’d with vengeance but with tears,

Himself convinc’d of Palamabrons turpitude. Los beheld

The servants of the Mills drunken with wine and dancing wild

With shouts and Palamabrons songs, rending the forests green

10    With ecchoing confusion, tho’ the Sun was risen on high.

Then Los took off his left sandal placing it on his head,

Signal of solemn mourning: when the servants of the Mills

Beheld the signal they in silence stood, tho’ drunk with wine.

Los wept\! But Rintrah also came, and Enitharmon on

His arm lean’d tremblingly observing all these things

And Los said. Ye Genii of the Mills\! the Sun is on high

Your labours call you\! Palamabron is also in sad dilemma.

His horses are mad\! his Harrow confounded\! his companions enrag’d.

Mine is the fault\! I should have remember’d that pity divides the soul

20    And man, unmans: follow with me my Plow. this mournful day

Must be a blank in Nature: follow with me, and tomorrow again

Resume your labours, & this day shall be a mournful day

Wildly they follow’d Los and Rintrah, & the Mills were silent

They mourn’d all day, this mournful day of Satan & Palamabron:

And all the Elect & all the Redeem’d mourn’d one toward another

Upon the mountains of Albion among the cliffs of the Dead.

They Plow’d in tears\! incessant pourd Jehovahs rain, & Molechs

Thick fires contending with the rain, thunder’d above rolling

Terrible over their heads; Satan wept over Palamabron

Theotormon & Bromion contended on the side of Satan 30

Pitying his youth and beauty; trembling at eternal death:

Michael contended against Satan in the rolling thunder

Thulloh the friend of Satan also reprovd him; faint their reproof.

But Rintrah who is of the reprobate: of those form’d to destruction

In indignation. for Satans soft dissimulation of friendship\!

Flam’d above all the plowed furrows, angry red and furious,

Till Michael sat down in the furrow weary dissolv’d in tears\[.\]

Satan who drave the team beside him, stood angry & red

He smote Thulloh & slew him, & he stood terrible over Michael

40    Urging him to arise: he wept\! Enitharmon saw his tears

But Los hid Thulloh from her sight, lest she should die of grief

She wept: she trembled\! she kissed Satan; she wept over Michael

She form’d a Space for Satan & Michael & for the poor infected\[.\]

Trembling she wept over the Space, & clos’d it with a tender Moon

Los secret buried Thulloh, weeping disconsolate over the moony Space

But Palamabron called down a Great Solemn Assembly,

That he who will not defend Truth, may be compelled to

Defend a Lie, that he may be snared & caught & taken

PLATE 9

And all Eden descended into Palamabrons tent

Among Albions Druids & Bards, in the caves beneath Albions

Death Couch, in the caverns of death, in the corner of the Atlantic.

And in the midst of the Great Assembly Palamabron pray’d:

O God, protect me from my friends, that they have not power over me

Thou hast giv’n me power to protect myself from my bitterest enemies.

Mark well my words, they are of your eternal salvation

Then rose the Two Witnesses, Rintrah & Palamabron:

And Palamabron appeal’d to all Eden, and recievd

10    Judgment: and Lo\! it fell on Rintrah and his rage:

Which now flam’d high & furious in Satan against Palamabron

Till it became a proverb in Eden. Satan is among the Reprobate.

Los in his wrath curs’d heaven & earth, he rent up Nations,

Standing on Albions rocks among high-reard Druid temples

Which reach the stars of heaven & stretch from pole to pole.

He displacd continents, the oceans fled before his face

He alter’d the poles of the world, east, west & north & south

But he clos’d up Enitharmon from the sight of all these things

For Satan flaming with Rintrahs fury hidden beneath his own mildness

20    Accus’d Palamabron before the Assembly of ingratitude\! of malice:

He created Seven deadly Sins drawing out his infernal scroll,

Of Moral laws and cruel punishments upon the clouds of Jehovah

To pervert the Divine voice in its entrance to the earth

With thunder of war & trumpets sound, with armies of disease

Punishments & deaths musterd & number’d; Saying I am God alone

There is no other\! let all obey my principles of moral individuality

I have brought them from the uppermost innermost recesses

Of my Eternal Mind. transgressors I will rend off for ever,

As now I rend this accursed Family from my covering.

30    Thus Satan rag’d amidst the Assembly\! and his bosom grew

Opake against the Divine Vision: the paved terraces of

His bosom inwards shone with fires, but the stones becoming opake:

Hid him from sight, in an extreme blackness and darkness,

And there a World of deeper Ulro was open’d, in the midst

Of the Assembly. In Satans bosom a vast unfathomable Abyss.

Astonishment held the Assembly in an awful silence: and tears

Fell down as dews of night, & a loud solemn universal groan

Was utter’d from the east & from the west & from the south

And from the north; and Satan stood opake immeasurable

40    Covering the east with solid blackness, round his hidden heart,

With thunders utterd from his hidden wheels: accusing loud

The Divine Mercy, for protecting Palamabron in his tent.

Rintrah rear’d up walls of rocks and pourd rivers & moats

Of fire round the walls: columns of fire guard around

Between Satan and Palamabron in the terrible darkness.

And Satan not having the Science of Wrath, but only of Pity:

Rent them asunder, and wrath was left to wrath, & pity to pity.

He sunk down a dreadful Death, unlike the slumbers of Beulah

The Separation was terrible: the Dead was repos’d on his Couch

50    Beneath the Couch of Albion, on the seven mou\[n\]tains of Rome

In the whole place of the Covering Cherub, Rome Babylon & Tyre.

His Spectre raging furious descended into its Space

PLATE 10

Then Los & Enitharmon knew that Satan is Urizen

Drawn down by Orc & the Shadowy Female into Generation

Oft Enitharmon enterd weeping into the Space, there appearing

An aged Woman raving along the Streets \(the Space is named

Canaan\) then she returnd to Los weary frighted as from dreams

The nature of a Female Space is this: it shrinks the Organs

Of Life till they become Finite & Itself seems Infinite

And Satan vibrated in the immensity of the Space\! Limited

To those without but Infinite to those within: it fell down and

10    Became Canaan: closing Los from Eternity in Albions Cliffs

A mighty Fiend against the Divine Humanity mustring to War

Satan\! Ah me\! is gone to his own place, said Los\! their God

I will not worship in their Churches, nor King in their Theatres

Elynittria\! whence is this Jealousy running along the mountains

British women were not Jealous when Greek & Roman were Jealous

Every thing in Eternity shines by its own Internal light: but thou

Darkenest every Internal light with the arrows of thy quiver

Bound up in the horns of Jealousy to a deadly fading Moon

And Ocalythron binds the Sun into a Jealous Globe

20    That every thing is fixd Opake without Internal light

So Los lamented over Satan, who triumphant divided the Nations

PLATE 11

He set his face against Jerusalem to destroy the Eon of Albion

But Los hid Enitharmon from the sight of all these things,

Upon the Thames whose lulling harmony repos’d her soul:

Where Beulah lovely terminates in rocky Albion:

Terminating in Hyde Park, on Tyburns awful brook.

And the Mills of Satan were separated into a moony Space

Among the rocks of Albions Temples, and Satans Druid sons

Offer the Human Victims throughout all the Earth, and Albions

Dread Tomb immortal on his Rock, overshadowd the whole Earth:

10    Where Satan making to himself Laws from his own identity,

Compell’d others to serve him in moral gratitude & submission

Being call’d God: setting himself above all that is called God.

And all the Spectres of the Dead calling themselves Sons of God

In his Synagogues worship Satan under the Unutterable Name

And it was enquir’d: Why in a Great Solemn Assembly

The Innocent should be condemn’d for the Guilty? Then an Eternal rose

Saying. If the Guilty should be condemn’d, he must be an Eternal Death

And one must die for another throughout all Eternity.

Satan is fall’n from his station & never can be redeem’d

20    But must be new Created continually moment by moment

And therefore the Class of Satan shall be calld the Elect, & those

Of Rintrah, the Reprobate, & those of Palamabron the Redeem’d

For he is redeem’d from Satans Law, the wrath falling on Rintrah,

And therefore Palamabron dared not to call a solemn Assembly

Till Satan had assum’d Rintrahs wrath in the day of mourning

In a feminine delusion of false pride self-deciev’d.

So spake the Eternal and confirm’d it with a thunderous oath.

But when Leutha \(a Daughter of Beulah\) beheld Satans condemnation

She down descended into the midst of the Great Solemn Assembly

30    Offering herself a Ransom for Satan, taking on her, his Sin.

Mark well my words, they are of your eternal salvation\!

And Leutha stood glowing with varying colours immortal, heart-piercing

And lovely: & her moth-like elegance shone over the Assembly

At length standing upon the golden floor of Palamabron

She spake: I am the Author of this Sin\! by my suggestion

My Parent power Satan has committed this transgression.

I loved Palamabron & I sought to approach his Tent,

But beautiful Elynittria with her silver arrows repelld me.

PLATE 12

For her light is terrible to me. I fade before her immortal beauty.

O wherefore doth a Dragon-form forth issue from my limbs

To sieze her new born son? Ah me\! the wretched Leutha\!

This to prevent, entering the doors of Satans brain night after night

Like sweet perfumes I stupified the masculine perceptions

And kept only the feminine awake. hence rose his soft Delusory

love to Palamabron: admiration join’d with envy

Cupidity unconquerable\! my fault, when at noon of day

The Horses of Palamabron call’d for rest and pleasant death:

10    I sprang out of the breast of Satan, over the Harrow beaming

In all my beauty: that I might unloose the flaming steeds

As Elynittria use’d to do; but too well those living creatures

Knew that I was not Elynittria, and they brake the traces

But me, the servants of the Harrow saw not: but as a bow

Of varying colours on the hills; terribly rag’d the horses.

Satan astonishd, and with power above his own controll

Compell’d the Gnomes to curb the horses, & to throw banks of sand

Around the fiery flaming Harrow in labyrinthine forms.

And brooks between to intersect the meadows in their course.

20    The Harrow cast thick flames: Jehovah thunderd above:

Chaos & ancient night fled from beneath the fiery Harrow:

The Harrow cast thick flames & orb’d us round in concave fires

A Hell of our own making. see, its flames still gird me round\[.\]

Jehovah thunder’d above: Satan in pride of heart

Drove the fierce Harrow among the constellations of Jehovah

Drawing a third part in the fires as stubble north & south

To devour Albion and Jerusalem the Emanation of Albion

Driving the Harrow in Pitys paths. ’twas then, with our dark fires

Which now gird round us \(O eternal torment\) I form’d the Serpent

30    Of precious stones & gold turn’d poisons on the sultry wastes

The Gnomes in all that day spar’d not; they curs’d Satan bitterly.

To do unkind things in kindness\! with power armd, to say

The most irritating things in the midst of tears and love

These are the stings of the Serpent\! thus did we by them; till thus

They in return retaliated, and the Living Creatures maddend.

The Gnomes labourd. I weeping hid in Satans inmost brain;

But when the Gnomes refus’d to labour more, with blandishments

I came forth from the head of Satan: back the Gnomes recoil’d.

And call’d me Sin, and for a sign portentous held me. Soon

40    Day sunk and Palamabron return’d, trembling I hid myself

In Satans inmost Palace of his nervous fine wrought Brain:

For Elynittria met Satan with all her singing women.

Terrific in their joy & pouring wine of wildest power

They gave Satan their wine: indignant at the burning wrath.

Wild with prophetic fury his former life became like a dream

Cloth’d in the Serpents folds, in selfish holiness demanding purity

Being most impure, self-condemn’d to eternal tears, he drove

Me from his inmost Brain & the doors clos’d with thunders sound

O Divine Vision who didst create the Female: to repose

The Sleepers of Beulah: pity the repentant Leutha. My

PLATE 13

Sick Couch bears the dark shades of Eternal Death infolding

The Spectre of Satan. he furious refuses to repose in sleep.

I humbly bow in all my Sin before the Throne Divine.

Not so the Sick-one; Alas what shall be done him to restore?

Who calls the Individual Law, Holy: and despises the Saviour

Glorying to involve Albions Body in fires of eternal War –

Now Leutha ceas’d: tears flow’d: but the Divine Pity supported her.

All is my fault\! We are the Spectre of Luvah the murderer

Of Albion: O Vala\! O Luvah\! O Albion\! O lovely Jerusalem

10    The Sin was begun in Eternity, and will not rest to Eternity

Till two Eternitys meet together, Ah\! lost\! lost\! lost\! for ever\!

So Leutha spoke. But when she saw that Enitharmon had

Created a New Space to protect Satan from punishment;

She fled to Enitharmons Tent & hid herself. Loud raging

Thunderd the Assembly dark & clouded, and they ratify’d

The kind decision of Enitharmon & gave a Time to the Space,

Even Six Thousand years; and sent Lucifer for its Guard.

But Lucifer refus’d to die & in pride he forsook his charge

And they elected Molech, and when Molech was impatient

20    The Divine hand found the Two Limits: first of Opacity, then of Contraction

Opacity was named Satan, Contraction was named Adam.

Triple Elohim came: Elohim wearied fainted: they elected Shaddai.

Shaddai angry, Pahad descended: Pahad terrified, they sent Jehovah

And Jehovah was leprous; loud he call’d, stretching his hand to Eternity

For then the Body of Death was perfected in hypocritic holiness,

Around the Lamb, a Female Tabernacle woven in Cathedrons Looms

He died as a Reprobate. he was Punish’d as a Transgressor\!

Glory\! Glory\! Glory\! to the Holy Lamb of God

I touch the heavens as an instrument to glorify the Lord\!

30    The Elect shall meet the Redeem’d. on Albions rocks they shall meet

Astonish’d at the Transgressor, in him beholding the Saviour.

And the Elect shall say to the Redeemd. We behold it is of Divine

Mercy alone\! of Free Gift and Election that we live.

Our Virtues & Cruel Goodnesses, have deserv’d Eternal Death.

Thus they weep upon the fatal Brook of Albions River.

But Elynittria met Leutha in the place where she was hidden.

And threw aside her arrows, and laid down her sounding Bow;

She sooth’d her with soft words & brought her to Palamabrons bed

In moments new created for delusion, interwoven round about,

40    In dreams she bore the shadowy Spectre of Sleep, & namd him Death.

In dreams she bore Rahab the mother of Tirzah & her sisters

In Lambeths vales; in Cambridge & in Oxford, places of Thought

Intricate labyrinths of Times and Spaces unknown, that Leutha lived

In Palamabrons Tent, and Oothoon was her charming guard.

The Bard ceas’d. All consider’d and a loud resounding murmur

Continu’d round the Halls; and much they questiond the immortal

Loud voicd Bard. and many condemn’d the high tone’d Song

Saying Pity and Love are too venerable for the imputation

Of Guilt. Others said. If it is true\! if the acts have been perform’d

50    Let the Bard himself witness. Where hadst thou this terrible Song

The Bard replied. I am Inspired\! I know it is Truth\! for I Sing

PLATE 14

According to the inspiration of the Poetic Genius

Who is the eternal all-protecting Divine Humanity

To whom be Glory & Power & Dominion Evermore Amen

Then there was great murmuring in the Heavens of Albion

Concerning Generation & the Vegetative power & concerning

The Lamb the Saviour: Albion trembled to Italy Greece & Egypt

To Tartary & Hindostan & China & to Great America

Shaking the roots & fast foundations of the Earth in doubtfulness

The loud voic’d Bard terrify’d took refuge in Miltons bosom

10    Then Milton rose up from the heavens of Albion ardorous\!

The whole Assembly wept prophetic, seeing in Miltons face

And in his lineaments divine the shades of Death & Ulro

He took off the robe of the promise, & ungirded himself from the oath of God

And Milton said, I go to Eternal Death\! The Nations still

Follow after the detestable Gods of Priam; in pomp

Of warlike selfhood, contradicting and blaspheming.

When will the Resurrection come; to deliver the sleeping body

From corruptibility: O when Lord Jesus wilt thou come?

Tarry no longer; for my soul lies at the gates of death.

20    I will arise and look forth for the morning of the grave.

I will go down to the sepulcher to see if morning breaks\!

I will go down to self annihilation and eternal death,

Lest the Last Judgment come & find me unannihilate

And I be siez’d & giv’n into the hands of my own Selfhood.

The Lamb of God is seen thro’ mists & shadows, hov’ring

Over the sepulchers in clouds of Jehovah & winds of Elohim

A disk of blood, distant; & heav’ns & earth’s roll dark between

What do I here before the Judgment? without my Emanation?

With the daughters of memory, & not with the daughters of inspiration\[?\]

30    I in my Selfhood am that Satan: I am that Evil One\!

He is my Spectre\! in my obedience to loose him from my Hells

To claim the Hells, my Furnaces, I go to Eternal Death.

And Milton said. I go to Eternal Death\! Eternity shudder’d

For he took the outside course, among the graves of the dead

A mournful shade. Eternity shudderd at the image of eternal death

Then on the verge of Beulah he beheld his own Shadow;

A mournful form double; hermaphroditic: male & female

In one wonderful body. and he enterd into it

In direful pain for the dread shadow, twenty-seven-fold

Reachd to the depths of direst Hell, & thence to Albions land:

Which is this earth of vegetation on which now I write.

The Seven Angels of the Presence wept over Miltons Shadow\!

PLATE 15

As when a man dreams, he reflects not that his body sleeps,

Else he would wake; so seem’d he entering his Shadow: but

With him the Spirits of the Seven Angels of the Presence

Entering; they gave him still perceptions of his Sleeping Body;

Which now arose and walk’d with them in Eden, as an Eighth

Image Divine tho’ darken’d; and tho walking as one walks

In sleep; and the Seven comforted and supported him.

Like as a Polypus that vegetates beneath the deep\!

They saw his Shadow vegetated underneath the Couch

10    Of death: for when he enterd into his Shadow: Himself:

His real and immortal Self: was as appeard to those

Who dwell in immortality, as One sleeping on a couch

Of gold; and those in immortality gave forth their Emanations

Like Females of sweet beauty, to guard round him & to feed

His lips with food of Eden in his cold and dim repose:

But to himself he seemd a wanderer lost in dreary night.

Onwards his Shadow kept its course among the Spectres; call’d

Satan, but swift as lightning passing them, startled the shades

Of Hell beheld him in a trail of light as of a comet

20    That travels into Chaos: so Milton went guarded within.

The nature of infinity is this\! That every thing has its

Own Vortex; and when once a traveller thro’ Eternity

Has passd that Vortex, he percieves it roll backward behind

His path, into a globe itself infolding; like a sun:

Or like a moon, or like a universe of starry majesty,

While he keeps onwards in his wondrous journey on the earth

Or like a human form, a friend with whom he livd benevolent.

As the eye of man views both the east & west encompassing

Its vortex; and the north & south, with all their starry host;

30    Also the rising sun & setting moon he views surrounding

His corn-fields and his valleys of five hundred acres square.

Thus is the earth one infinite plane, and not as apparent

To the weak traveller confin’d beneath the moony shade.

Thus is the heaven a vortex passd already, and the earth

A vortex not yet pass’d by the traveller thro’ Eternity.

First Milton saw Albion upon the Rock of Ages,

Deadly pale outstretchd and snowy cold, storm coverd;

A Giant form of perfect beauty outstretchd on the rock

In solemn death: the Sea of Time & Space thunderd aloud

40    Against the rock, which was inwrapped with the weeds of death

Hovering over the cold bosom, in its vortex Milton bent down

To the bosom of death, what was underneath soon seemd above.

A cloudy heaven mingled with stormy seas in loudest ruin;

But as a wintry globe descends precipitant thro’ Beulah bursting,

With thunders loud, and terrible: so Miltons shadow fell,

Precipitant loud thundring into the Sea of Time & Space.

Then first I saw him in the Zenith as a falling star,

Descending perpendicular, swift as the swallow or swift;

And on my left foot falling on the tarsus, enterd there;

50    But from my left foot a black cloud redounding spread over Europe.

Then Milton knew that the Three Heavens of Beulah were beheld

By him on earth in his bright pilgrimage of sixty years

PLATE 16

\[Full-page design. For caption see Textual Note.\]

PLATE 17

In those three females whom his Wives, & those three whom his Daughters

Had represented and containd, that they might be resum’d

By giving up of Selfhood: & they distant view’d his journey

In their eternal spheres, now Human, tho’ their Bodies remain clos’d

In the dark Ulro till the Judgment: also Milton knew: they and

Himself was Human, tho’ now wandering thro Death’s Vale

In conflict with those Female forms, which in blood & jealousy

Surrounded him, dividing & uniting without end or number.

He saw the Cruelties of Ulro, and he wrote them down

10    In iron tablets: and his Wives & Daughters names were these

Rahab and Tirzah, & Milcah & Malah & Noah & Hoglah.

They sat rang’d round him as the rocks of Horeb round the land

Of Canaan: and they wrote in thunder smoke and fire

His dictate; and his body was the Rock Sinai; that body,

Which was on earth born to corruption: & the six Females

Are Hor & Peor & Bashan & Abarim & Lebanon & Hermon

Seven rocky masses terrible in the Desarts of Midian.

But Miltons Human Shadow continu’d journeying above

The rocky masses of The Mundane Shell; in the Lands

20    Of Edom & Aram & Moab & Midian & Amalek.

The Mundane Shell, is a vast Concave Earth: an immense

Hardend shadow of all things upon our Vegetated Earth

Enlarg’d into dimension & deform’d into indefinite space

In Twenty-seven Heavens and all their Hells; with Chaos

And Ancient Night; & Purgatory. It is a cavernous Earth

Of labyrinthine intricacy, twenty-seven folds of opakeness

And finishes where the lark mounts; here Milton journeyed

In that Region call’d Midian, among the Rocks of Horeb\[.\]

For travellers from Eternity. pass outward to Satan’s seat,

30    But travellers to Eternity. pass inward to Golgonooza.

Los the Vehicular terror beheld him, & divine Enitharmon

Call’d all her daughters, Saying. Surely to unloose my bond

Is this Man come\! Satan shall be unloosd upon Albion

Los heard in terror Enitharmons words: in fibrous strength

His limbs shot forth like roots of trees against the forward path

Of Miltons journey. Urizen beheld the immortal Man,

PLATE 18

And Tharmas Demon of the Waters, & Orc, who is Luvah

The Shadowy Female seeing Milton, howl’d in her lamentation

Over the Deeps outstretching her Twenty seven Heavens over Albion

And thus the Shadowy Female howls in articulate howlings

I will lament over Milton in the lamentations of the afflicted

My Garments shall be woven of sighs & heart broken lamentations

The misery of unhappy Families shall be drawn out into its border

Wrought with the needle with dire sufferings poverty pain & woe

Along the rocky Island & thence throughout the whole Earth

10    There shall be the sick Father & his starving Family\! there

The Prisoner in the stone Dungeon & the Slave at the Mill

I will have Writings written all over it in Human Words

That every Infant that is born upon the Earth shall read

And get by rote as a hard task of a life of sixty years

I will have Kings inwoven upon it & Councellors & Mighty Men

The Famine shall clasp it together with buckles & Clasps

And the Pestilence shall be its fringe & the War its girdle

To divide into Rahab & Tirzah that Milton may come to our tents

For I will put on the Human Form & take the Image of God

20    Even Pity & Humanity but my Clothing shall be Cruelty

And I will put on Holiness as a breastplate & as a helmet

And all my ornaments shall be of the gold of broken hearts

And the precious stones of anxiety & care & desperation & death

And repentance for sin & sorrow & punishment & fear

To defend me from thy terrors O Orc\! my only beloved\!

Ore answerd. Take not the Human Form O loveliest. Take not

Terror upon thee\! Behold how I am & tremble lest thou also

Consume in my Consummation; but thou maist take a Form

Female & lovely, that cannot consume in Mans consummation

30    Wherefore dost thou Create & Weave this Satan for a Covering\[?\]

When thou attemptest to put on the Human Form, my wrath

Burns to the top of heaven against thee in Jealousy & Fear.

Then I rend thee asunder, then I howl over thy clay & ashes

When wilt thou put on the Female Form as in times of old

With a Garment of Pity & Compassion like the Garment of God

His garments are long sufferings for the Children of Men

Jerusalem is his Garment & not thy Covering Cherub O lovely

Shadow of my delight who wanderest seeking for the prey.

So spoke Orc when Oothoon & Leutha hoverd over his Couch

40    Of fire in interchange of Beauty & Perfection in the darkness

Opening interiorly into Jerusalem & Babylon shining glorious

In the Shadowy Females bosom. Jealous her darkness grew:

Howlings filld all the desolate places in accusations of Sin

In Female beauty shining in the unformd void & Orc in vain

Stretch’d out his hands of fire, & wooed: they triumph in his pain

Thus darkend the Shadowy Female tenfold & Orc tenfold

Glowd on his rocky Couch against the darkness: loud thunders

Told of the enormous conflict\[.\] Earthquake beneath: around;

Rent the Immortal Females, limb from limb & joint from joint

50    And moved the fast foundations of the Earth to wake the Dead

Urizen emerged from his Rocky Form & from his Snows,

PLATE 19

And he also darkend his brows: freezing dark rocks between

The footsteps. and infixing deep the feet in marble beds:

That Milton labourd with his journey, & his feet bled sore

Upon the clay now changd to marble; also Urizen rose,

And met him on the shores of Arnon; & by the streams of the brooks

Silent they met, and silent strove among the streams, of Arnon

Even to Mahanaim, when with cold hand Urizen stoop’d down

And took up water from the river Jordan: pouring on

To Miltons brain the icy fluid from his broad cold palm.

10    But Milton took of the red clay of Succoth, moulding it with care

Between his palms; and filling up the furrows of many years

Beginning at the feet of Urizen, and on the bones

Creating new flesh on the Demon cold, and building him,

As with new clay a Human form in the Valley of Beth Peor.

Four Universes round the Mundane Egg remain Chaotic

One to the North, named Urthona: One to the South, named Urizen:

One to the East, named Luvah: One to the West, named Tharmas

They are the Four Zoa’s that stood around the Throne Divine\!

But when Luvah assum’d the World of Urizen to the South:

20    And Albion was slain upon his mountains, & in his tent;

All fell towards the Center in dire ruin, sinking down.

And in the South remains a burning fire; in the East a void.

In the West, a world of raging waters; in the North a solid,

Unfathomable\! without end. But in the midst of these,

Is built eternally the Universe of Los and Enitharmon:

Towards which Milton went, but Urizen oppos’d his path.

The Man and Demon strove many periods. Rahab beheld

Standing on Carmel; Rahab and Tirzah trembled to behold

The enormous strife. one giving life, the other giving death

30    To his adversary. and they sent forth all their sons & daughters

In all their beauty to entice Milton across the river,

The Twofold form Hermaphroditic: and the Doublesexed;

The Female-male & the Male-female, self-dividing stood

Before him in their beauty, & in cruelties of holiness\!

Shining in darkness, glorious upon the deeps of Entuthon.

Saying. Come thou to Ephraim\! behold the Kings of Canaan\!

The beautiful Amalekites, behold the fires of youth

Bound with the Chain of Jealousy by Los & Enitharmon;

The banks of Cam: cold learnings streams: Londons dark-frowning towers,

40    Lament upon the winds of Europe in Rephaims Vale.

Because Ahania rent apart into a desolate night,

Laments\! & Enion wanders like a weeping inarticulate voice

And Vala labours for her bread & water among the Furnaces

Therefore bright Tirzah triumphs: putting on all beauty,

And all perfection, in her cruel sports among the Victims.

Come bring with thee Jerusalem with songs on the Grecian Lyre\!

In Natural Religion: in experiments on Men,

Let her be Offerd up to Holiness\! Tirzah numbers her;

She numbers with her fingers every fibre ere it grow;

50    Where is the Lamb of God? where is the promise of his coming?

Her shadowy Sisters form the bones, even the bones of Horeb:

Around the marrow: and the orbed scull around the brain:

His Images are born for War\! for Sacrifice to Tirzah\!

To Natural Religion\! to Tirzah the Daughter of Rahab the Holy\!

She ties the knot of nervous fibres, into a white brain\!

She ties the knot of bloody veins, into a red hot heart\!

Within her bosom Albion lies embalmd, never to awake

Hand is become a rock\! Sinai & Horeb, is Hyle & Coban:

Scofield is bound in iron armour before Reubens Gate\!

60    She ties the knot of milky seed into two lovely Heavens

PLATE 20

Two yet but one: each in the other sweet reflected\! these

Are our Three Heavens beneath the shades of Beulah, land of rest\!

Come then to Ephraim & Manasseh O beloved-one\!

Come to my ivory palaces O beloved of thy mother\!

And let us bind thee in the bands of War & be thou King

Of Canaan and reign in Hazor where the Twelve Tribes meet.

So spoke they as in one voice: Silent Milton stood before

The darkend Urizen; as the sculptor silent stands before

His forming image; he walks round it patient labouring.

10    Thus Milton stood forming bright Urizen, while his Mortal part

Sat frozen in the rock of Horeb: and his Redeemed portion,

Thus form’d the Clay of Urizen; but within that portion

His real Human walkd above in power and majesty

Tho darkend; and the Seven Angels of the Presence attended him.

O how can I with my gross tongue that cleaveth to the dust,

Tell of the Four-fold Man, in starry numbers fitly orderd

Or how can I with my cold hand of clay\! But thou O Lord

Do with me as thou wilt\! for I am nothing, and vanity.

If thou chuse to elect a worm, it shall remove the mountains.

20    For that portion namd the Elect: the Spectrous body of Milton:

Redounding from my left foot into Los’s Mundane space,

Brooded over his Body in Horeb against the Resurrection

Preparing it for the Great Consummation; red the Cherub on Sinai

Glow’d; but in terrors folded round his clouds of blood.

Now Albions sleeping Humanity began to turn upon his Couch;

Feeling the electric flame of Miltons awful precipitate descent.

Seest thou the little winged fly, smaller than a grain of sand?

It has a heart like thee; a brain open to heaven & hell, Withinside wondrous & expansive; its gates are not clos’d,

30    I hope thine are not: hence it clothes itself in rich array;

Hence thou art cloth’d with human beauty O thou mortal man.

Seek not thy heavenly father then beyond the skies:

There Chaos dwells & ancient Night & Og & Anak old:

For every human heart has gates of brass & bars of adamant,

Which few dare unbar because dread Og & Anak guard the gates

Terrific\! and each mortal brain is walld and moated round

Within: and Og & Anak watch here; here is the Seat

Of Satan in its Webs, for in brain and heart and loins

Gates open behind Satans Seat to the City of Golgonooza

40    Which is the spiritual fourfold London, in the loins of Albion

Thus Milton fell thro Albions heart, travelling outside of Humanity

Beyond the Stars in Chaos in Caverns of the Mundane Shell.

But many of the Eternals rose up from eternal tables

Drunk with the Spirit, burning round the Couch of death they stood

Looking down into Beulah: wrathful, fill’d with rage\!

They rend the heavens round the Watchers in a fiery circle:

And round the Shadowy Eighth: the Eight close up the Couch

Into a tabernacle, and flee with cries down to the Deeps:

Where Los opens his three wide gates, surrounded by raging fires\!

50    They soon find their own place & join the Watchers of the Ulro.

Los saw them and a cold pale horror coverd o’er his limbs

Pondering he knew that Rintrah & Palamabron might depart:

Even as Reuben & as Gad; gave up himself to tears.

He sat down on his anvil-stock; and leand upon the trough.

Looking into the black water, mingling it with tears.

At last when desperation almost tore his heart in twain

He recollected an old Prophecy in Eden recorded,

And often sung to the loud harp at the immortal feasts

That Milton of the Land of Albion should up ascend

60    Forwards from Ulro from the Vale of Felpham; and set free

Orc from his Chain of Jealousy, he started at the thought

PLATE 21

And down descended into Udan-Adan; it was night:

And Satan sat sleeping upon his Couch in Udan-Adan:

His Spectre slept, his Shadow woke; when one sleeps th’other wakes.

But Milton entering my Foot; I saw in the nether

Regions of the Imagination; also all men on Earth,

And all in Heaven, saw in the nether regions of the Imagination

In Ulro beneath Beulah, the vast breach of Miltons descent.

But I knew not that it was Milton, for man cannot know

What passes in his members till periods of Space & Time

10    Reveal the secrets of Eternity: for more extensive

Than any other earthly things, are Mans earthly lineaments.

And all this Vegetable World appeard on my left Foot,

As a bright sandal formd immortal of precious stones & gold:

I stooped down & bound it on to walk forward thro’ Eternity.

There is in Eden a sweet River, of milk & liquid pearl.

Named Ololon; on whose mild banks dwelt those who Milton drove

Down into Ulro: and they wept in long resounding song

For seven days of eternity, and the rivers living banks

The mountains wail’d\! & every plant that grew, in solemn sighs lamented.

20    When Luvahs bulls each morning drag the sulphur Sun out of the Deep

Harnessd with starry harness black & shining kept by black slaves

That work all night at the starry harness, Strong and vigorous

They drag the unwilling Orb: at this time all the Family

Of Eden heard the lamentation, and Providence began.

But when the clarions of day sounded they drownd the lamentations

And when night came all was silent in Ololon: & all refusd to lament

In the still night fearing lest they should others molest.

Seven mornings Los heard them, as the poor bird within the shell

Hears its impatient parent bird; and Enitharmon heard them:

30    But saw them not, for the blue Mundane Shell inclos’d them in.

And they lamented that they had in wrath & fury & fire

Driven Milton into the Ulro; for now they knew too late

That it was Milton the Awakener: they had not heard the Bard,

Whose song calld Milton to the attempt; and Los heard these laments.

He heard them call in prayer all the Divine Family;

And he beheld the Cloud of Milton stretching over Europe.

But all the Family Divine collected as Four Suns

In the Four Points of heaven East, West & North & South,

Enlarging and enlarging till their Disks approachd each other;

40    And when they touch’d closed together Southward in One Sun

Over Ololon: and as One Man, who weeps over his brother,

In a dark tomb, so all the Family Divine. wept over Ololon.

Saying. Milton goes to Eternal Death\! so saying, they groan’d in spirit

And were troubled\! and again the Divine Family groaned in spirit\!

And Ololon said, Let us descend also, and let us give

Ourselves to death in Ulro among the Transgressors.

Is Virtue a Punisher? O no\! how is this wondrous thing?

This World beneath, unseen before: this refuge from the wars

Of Great Eternity\! unnatural refuge\! unknown by us till now\!

50    Or are these the pangs of repentance? let us enter into them

Then the Divine Family said. Six Thousand Years are now

Accomplish’d in this World of Sorrow; Miltons Angel knew

The Universal Dictate; and you also feel this Dictate.

And now you know this World of Sorrow, and feel Pity. Obey

The Dictate\! Watch over this World, and with your brooding wings,

Renew it to Eternal Life: Lo\! I am with you alway

But you cannot renew Milton he goes to Eternal Death

So spake the Family Divine as One Man even Jesus

Uniting in One with Ololon & the appearance of One Man

60    Jesus the Saviour appeard coming in the Clouds of Ololon:

PLATE 22

Tho driven away with the Seven Starry Ones into the Ulro

Yet the Divine Vision remains Every-where For-ever. Amen.

And Ololon lamented for Milton with a great lamentation.

While Los heard indistinct in fear, what time I bound my sandals

On; to walk forward thro’ Eternity, Los descended to me:

And Los behind me stood; a terrible flaming Sun: just close

Behind my back; I turned round in terror, and behold.

Los stood in that fierce glowing fire; & he also stoop’d down

And bound my sandals on in Udan-Adan; trembling I stood

10    Exceedingly with fear & terror, standing in the Vale

Of Lambeth: but he kissed me, and wishd me health.

And I became One Man with him arising in my strength:

Twas too late now to recede. Los had enterd into my soul:

His terrors now posses’d me whole\! I arose in fury & strength.

I am that Shadowy Prophet who Six Thousand Years ago

Fell from my station in the Eternal bosom. Six Thousand Years

Are finishd. I return\! both Time & Space obey my will.

I in Six Thousand Years walk up and down: for not one Moment

Of Time is lost, nor one Event of Space unpermanent.

20    But all remain: every fabric of Six Thousand Years

Remains permanent: tho’ on the Earth where Satan

Fell, and was cut off all things vanish & are seen no more

They vanish not from me & mine, we guard them first & last\[.\]

The generations of men run on in the tide of Time

But leave their destind lineaments permanent for ever & ever.

So spoke Los as we went along to his supreme abode

Rintrah and Palamabron met us at the Gate of Golgonooza

Clouded with discontent. & brooding in their minds terrible things

They said. O Father most beloved\! O merciful Parent\!

30    Pitying and permitting evil, tho strong & mighty to destroy.

Whence is this Shadow terrible? wherefore dost thou refuse

To throw him into the Furnaces\! knowest thou not that he

Will unchain Orc? & let loose Satan, Og, Sihon & Anak,

Upon the Body of Albion? for this he is come\! behold it Written

Upon his fibrous left Foot black\! most dismal to our eyes

The Shadowy Female shudders thro’ heaven in torment inexpressible\!

And all the Daughters of Los prophetic wail: yet in deceit,

They weave a new Religion from new Jealousy of Theotormon\!

Miltons Religion is the cause: there is no end to destruction\!

40    Seeing the Churches at their Period in terror & despair:

Rahab created Voltaire; Tirzah created Rousseau;

Asserting the Self-righteousness against the Universal Saviour,

Mocking the Confessors & Martyrs, claiming Self-righteousness;

With cruel Virtue: making War upon the Lambs Redeemed;

To perpetuate War & Glory, to perpetuate the Laws of Sin:

They perverted Swedenborgs Visions in Beulah & in Ulro;

To destroy Jerusalem as a Harlot & her Sons as Reprobates;

To raise up Mystery the Virgin Harlot Mother of War,

Babylon the Great, the Abomination of Desolation\!

O Swedenborg\! strongest of men, the Samson shorn by the Churches\!

Shewing the Transgressors in Hell, the proud Warriors in Heaven:

Heaven as a Punisher & Hell as One under Punishment:

With Laws from Plato & his Greeks to renew the Trojan Gods,

In Albion; & to deny the value of the Saviours blood.

But then I rais’d up Whitefield, Palamabron raisd up Westley,

And these are the cries of the Churches before the two Witnesses\[’\]

Faith in God the dear Saviour who took on the likeness of men:

Becoming obedient to death, even the death of the Cross

The Witnesses lie dead in the Street of the Great City

60    No Faith is in all the Earth: the Book of God is trodden under Foot:

He sent his two Servants Whitefield & Westley; were they Prophets

Or were they Idiots or Madmen? shew us Miracles\!

PLATE 23

Can you have greater Miracles than these? Men who devote

Their lifes whole comfort to intire scorn & injury & death

Awake thou sleeper on the Rock of Eternity Albion awake

The trumpet of Judgment hath twice sounded: all Nations are awake

But thou art still heavy and dull: Awake Albion awake\!

Lo Orc arises on the Atlantic. Lo his blood and fire

Glow on Americas shore: Albion turns upon his Couch

He listens to the sounds of War, astonishd and confounded:

He weeps into the Atlantic deep, yet still in dismal dreams

10    Unwakend\! and the Covering Cherub advances from the East:

How long shall we lay dead in the Street of the great City

How long beneath the Covering Cherub give our Emanations

Milton will utterly consume us & thee our beloved Father\[.\]

He hath enterd into the Covering Cherub, becoming one with

Albions dread Sons, Hand, Hyle & Coban surround him as

A girdle; Gwendolen & Conwenna as a garment woven

20    Of War & Religion; let us descend & bring him chained

To Bowlahoola O father most beloved\! O mild Parent\!

Cruel in thy mildness, pitying and permitting evil

Tho strong and mighty to destroy, O Los our beloved Father\!

Like the black storm, coming out of Chaos, beyond the stars:

It issues thro the dark & intricate caves of the Mundane Shell

Passing the planetary visions, & the well adorned Firmament

The Sun rolls into Chaos & the stars into the Desarts;

And then the storms become visible, audible & terrible,

Covering the light of day, & rolling down upon the mountains,

Deluge all the country round. Such is a vision of Los;

When Rintrah & Palamabron spoke; and such his stormy face

Appeard, as does the face of heaven, when coverd with thick storms

30    Pitying and loving tho in frowns of terrible perturbation

But Los dispersd the clouds even as the strong winds of Jehovah.

And Los thus spoke. O noble Sons, be patient yet a litde\[.\]

I have embracd the falling Death, he is become One with me

O Sons we live not by wrath, by mercy alone we live\!

I recollect an old Prophecy in Eden recorded in gold; and oft

Sung to the harp: That Milton of the land of Albion

Should up ascend forward from Felphams Vale & break the Chain

Of Jealousy from all its roots; be patient therefore O my Sons

These lovely Females form sweet night and silence and secret

40    Obscurities to hide from Satans Watch-Fiends. Human loves

And graces; lest they write them in their Books, & in the Scroll

Of mortal life, to condemn the accused: who at Satans Bar

Tremble in Spectrous Bodies continually day and night

While on the Earth they live in sorrowful Vegetations

O when shall we tread our Wine-presses in heaven; and Reap

Our wheat with shoutings of joy, and leave the Earth in peace

Remember how Calvin and Luther in fury premature

Sow’d War and stern division between Papists & Protestants

Let it not be so now: O go not forth in Martyrdoms & Wars

50    We were plac’d here by the Universal Brotherhood & Mercy

With powers fitted to circumscribe this dark Satanic death

And that the Seven Eyes of God may have space for Redemption.

But how this is as yet we know not, and we cannot know;

Till Albion is arisen; then patient wait a little while.

Six Thousand years are passd away the end approaches fast;

This mighty one is come from Eden, he is of the Elect,

Who died from Earth & he is returnd before the Judgment. This thing

Was never known that one of the holy dead should willing return

Then patient wait a little while till the Last Vintage is over:

60    Till we have quenched the Sun of Salah in the Lake of Udan Adan

O my dear Sons\! leave not your Father, as your brethren left me\[.\]

Twelve Sons successive fled away in that thousand years of sorrow

PLATE 24

Of Palamabrons Harrow, & of Rintrahs wrath & fury:

Reuben & Manazzoth & Gad & Simeon & Levi,

And Ephraim & Judah were Generated, because

They left me, wandering with Tirzah: Enitharmon wept

One thousand years, and all the Earth was in a watry deluge

We calld him Menassheh because of the Generations of Tirzah

Because of Satan: & the Seven Eyes of God continually

Guard round them, but I the Fourth Zoa am also set

The Watchman of Eternity, the Three are not\! & I am preserved

10    Still my four mighty ones are left to me in Golgonooza

Still Rintrah fierce, and Palamabron mild & piteous

Theotormon filld with care, Bromion loving Science

You O my Sons still guard round Los. O wander not & leave me

Rintrah, thou well rememberest when Amalek & Canaan

Fled with their Sister Moab into that abhorred Void

They became Nations in our sight beneath the hands of Tirzah.

And Palamabron thou rememberest when Joseph an infant;

Stolen from his nurses cradle wrapd in needle-work

Of emblematic texture, was sold to the Amalekite,

Who carried him down into Egypt where Ephraim & Menassheh  20

Gatherd my Sons together in the Sands of Midian

And if you also flee away and leave your Fathers side,

Following Milton into Ulro, altho your power is great

Surely you also shall become poor mortal vegetations

Beneath the Moon of Ulro: pity then your Fathers tears

When Jesus raisd Lazarus from the Grave I stood & saw

Lazarus who is the Vehicular Body of Albion the Redeemd

Arise into the Covering Cherub who is the Spectre of Albion

By Martyrdoms to suffer: to watch over the Sleeping Body.

Upon his Rock beneath his Tomb. I saw the Covering Cherub

Divide Four-fold into Four Churches when Lazarus arose

Paul, Constantine, Charlemaine, Luther; behold they stand before us

Stretchd over Europe & Asia. come O Sons, come, come away

Arise O Sons give all your strength against Eternal Death

Lest we are vegetated, for Cathedrons Looms weave only Death

A Web of Death: & were it not for Bowlahoola & Allamanda

No Human Form but only a Fibrous Vegetation

A Polypus of soft affections without Thought or Vision

Must tremble in the Heavens & Earths thro all the Ulro space

40    Throw all the Vegetated Mortals into Bowlahoola

But as to this Elected Form who is returnd again

He is the Signal that the Last Vintage now approaches

Nor Vegetation may go on till all the Earth is reapd

So Los spoke. Furious they descended to Bowlahoola & Allamanda

Indignant, unconvincd by Los’s arguments & thun\[d\]ers rolling

They saw that wrath now swayd and now pity absorbd him

As it was, so it remaind & no hope of an end.

Bowlahoola is namd Law. by mortals, Tharmas founded it:

Because of Satan, before Luban in the City of Golgonooza.

50    But Golgonooza is namd Art & Manufacture by mortal men

In Bowlahoola Los’s Anvils stand & his Furnaces rage;

Thundering the Hammers beat & the Bellows blow loud

Living self moving mourning lamenting & howling incessantly

Bowlahoola thro all its porches feels tho’ too fast founded

Its pillars & porticoes to tremble at the force

Of mortal or immortal arm: and softly lilling flutes

Accordant with the horrid labours make sweet melody

The Bellows are the Animal Lungs: the Hammers the Animal Heart

The Furnaces the Stomach for digestion, terrible their fury

60    Thousands & thousands labour, thousands play on instruments

Stringed or fluted to ameliorate the sorrows of slavery

Loud sport the dancers in the dance of death, rejoicing in carnage

The hard dentant Hammers are lulld by the flutes lula lula

The bellowing Furnaces\[’\] blare by the long sounding clarion

The double drum drowns howls & groans, the shrill fife, shrieks & cries:

The crooked horn mellows the hoarse raving serpent, terrible but harmonious

Bowlahoola is the Stomach in every individual man.

Los is by mortals nam’d Time Enitharmon is nam’d Space

70    But they depict him bald & aged who is in eternal youth

All powerful and his locks flourish like the brows of morning

He is the Spirit of Prophecy the ever apparent Elias

Time is the mercy of Eternity; without Times swiftness

Which is the swiftest of all things: all were eternal torment:

All the Gods of the Kingdoms of Earth labour in Los’s Halls.

Every one is a fallen Son of the Spirit of Prophecy

He is the Fourth Zoa, that stood arou\[n\]d the Throne Divine.

PLATE 25

Loud shout the Sons of Luvah, at the Wine-presses as Los descended

With Rintrah & Palamabron in his fires of resistless fury.

The Wine-press on the Rhine groans loud, but all its central beams

Act more terrific in the central Cities of the Nations

Where Human Thought is crushd beneath the iron hand of Power.

There Los puts all into the Press, the Opressor & the Opressed

Together, ripe for the Harvest & Vintage & ready for the Loom.

They sang at the Vintage. This is the Last Vintage\! & Seed

Shall no more be sown upon Earth, till all the Vintage is over

10    And all gatherd in, till the Plow has passd over the Nations

And the Harrow & heavy thundering Roller upon the mountains

And loud the Souls howl round the Porches of Golgonooza

Crying O God deliver us to the Heavens or to the Earths,

That we may preach righteousness & punish the sinner with death.

But Los refused, till all the Vintage of Earth was gatherd in.

And Los stood & cried to the Labourers of the Vintage in voice of awe.

Fellow Labourers\! The Great Vintage & Harvest is now upon Earth

The whole extent of the Globe is explored: Every scatterd Atom

Of Human Intellect now is flocking to the sound of the Trumpet

20    All the Wisdom which was hidden in caves & dens, from ancient

Time; is now sought out from Animal & Vegetable & Mineral

The Awakener is come, outstretchd over Europe\! the Vision of God is fulfilled

The Ancient Man upon the Rock of Albion Awakes,

He listens to the sounds of War astonishd & ashamed;

He sees his Children mock at Faith and deny Providence

Therefore you must bind the Sheaves not by Nations or Families

You shall bind them in Three Classes; according to their Classes

So you shall bind them. Separating What has been Mixed

Since Men began to be Wove into Nations by Rahab & Tirzah

30    Since Albions Death & Satans Cutting-off from our awful Fields;

When under pretence to benevolence the Elect Subdud All

From the Foundation of the World. The Elect is one Class: You

Shall bind them separate: they cannot Believe in Eternal Life

Except by Miracle & a New Birth. The other two Classes;

The Reprobate who never cease to Believe, and the Redeemd,

Who live in doubts & fears perpetually tormented by the Elect

These you shall bind in a twin-bundle for the Consummation

But the Elect must be saved \[from\] fires of Eternal Death,

To be formed into the Churches of Beulah that they destroy not the Earth

40    For in every Nation & every Family the Three Classes are born

And in every Species of Earth, Metal, Tree, Fish, Bird & Beast,

We form the Mundane Egg, that Spectres coming by fury or amity,

All is the same, & every one remains in his own energy\[.\]

Go forth Reapers with rejoicing, you sowed in tears

But the time of your refreshing cometh, only a little moment

Still abstain from pleasure & rest in the labours of eternity

And you shall Reap the whole Earth from Pole to Pole: from Sea to Sea

Begin\[n\]ing at Jerusalems Inner Court, Lambeth ruin’d and given

To the detestable Gods of Priam, to Apollo: and at the Asylum

50    Given to Hercules, who labour in Tirzahs Looms for bread

Who set Pleasure against Duty: who Create Olympic crowns

To make Learning a burden & the Work of the Holy Spirit: Strife.

The Thor & cruel Odin who first reard the Polar Caves

Lambeth mourns calling Jerusalem, she weeps & looks abroad

For the Lords coming, that Jerusalem may overspread all Nations\[.\]

Crave not for the mortal & perishing delights, but leave them

To the weak, and pity the weak as your infant care; Break not

Forth in your wrath lest you also are vegetated by Tirzah

Wait till the Judgement is past, till the Creation is consumed

60    And then rush forward with me into the glorious spiritual

Vegetation; the Supper of the Lamb & his Bride; and the

Awaking of Albion our friend and ancient companion.

So Los spoke. But lightnings of discontent broke on all sides round

And murmurs of thunder rolling heavy long & loud over the mountains

While Los calld his Sons around him to the Harvest & the Vintage.

Thou seest the Constellations in the deep & wondrous Night

They rise in order and continue their immortal courses

Upon the mountains & in vales with harp & heavenly song

With flute & clarion; with cups & measures filld with foaming wine

Glittering the streams reflect the Vision of beatitude,

And the calm Ocean joys beneath & smooths his awful waves\!

PLATE 26

These are the Sons of Los, & these the Labourers of the Vintage

Thou seest the gorgeous clothed Flies that dance & sport in summer

Upon the sunny brooks & meadows: every one the dance,

Knows in its intricate mazes of delight artful to weave:

Each one to sound his instruments of music in the dance,

To touch each other & recede; to cross & change & return

These are the Children of Los; thou seest the Trees on mountains

The wind blows heavy, loud they thunder thro’ the darksom sky

Uttering prophecies & speaking instructive words to the sons

10    Of men: These are the Sons of Los\! These the Visions of Eternity

But we see only as it were the hem of their garments

When with our vegetable eyes we view these wond’rous Visions

There are Two Gates thro which all Souls descend. One Southward

From Dover Cliff to Lizard Point, the other toward the North

Caithness & rocky Durness, Pentland & John Groats House.

The Souls descending to the Body, wail on the right hand

Of Los; & those deliverd from the Body, on the left hand

For Los against the east his force continually bends

Along the Valleys of Middlesex from Hounslow to Blackheath

20    Lest those Three Heavens of Beulah should the Creation destroy

And lest they should descend before the north & south Gates

Groaning with pity, he among the wailing Souls laments.

And these the Labours of the Sons of Los in Allamanda:

And in the City of Golgonooza: & in Luban: & around

The Lake of Udan-Adan, in the Forests of Entuthon Benython

Where Souls incessant wail, being piteous Passions & Desires

With neither lineament nor form but like to watry clouds

The Passions & Desires descend upon the hungry winds

For such alone Sleepers remain meer passion & appetite;

30    The Sons of Los clothe them & feed & provide houses & fields

And every Generated Body in its inward form,

Is a garden of delight & a building of magnificence,

Built by the Sons of Los in Bowlahoola & Allamanda

And the herbs & flowers & furniture & beds & chambers

Continually woven in the Looms of Enitharmons Daughters

In bright Cathedrons golden Dome with care & love & tears\[.\]

For the various Classes of Men are all markd out determinate

In Bowlahoola; & as the Spectres choose their affinities

So they are born on Earth, & every Class is determinate

40    But not by Natural but by Spiritual power alone. Because

The Natural power continually seeks & tends to Destruction

Ending in Death: which would of itself be Eternal Death

And all are Class’d by Spiritual, & not by Natural power.

And every Natural Effect has a Spiritual Cause, and Not

A Natural: for a Natural Cause only seems, it is a Delusion

Of Ulro: & a ratio of the perishing Vegetable Memory.

PLATE 27

But the Wine-press of Los is eastward of Golgonooza, before the Seat

Of Satan. Luvah laid the foundation & Urizen finish’d it in howling woe.

How red the sons & daughters of Luvah: here they tread the grapes.

Laughing & shouting drunk with odours many fall oerwearied

Drownd in the wine is many a youth & maiden: those around

Lay them on skins of Tygers & of the spotted Leopard & the Wild Ass

Till they revive, or bury them in cool grots, making lamentation.

This Wine-press is call’d War on Earth, it is the Printing-Press

Of Los; and here he lays his words in order above the mortal brain

10    As cogs are formd in a wheel to turn the cogs of the adverse wheel.

Timbrels & violins sport round the Wine-presses; the little Seed;

The sportive Root, the Earth-worm, the gold Beetle; the wise Emmet;

Dance round the Wine-presses of Luvah: the Centipede is there:

The ground Spider with many eyes: the Mole clothed in velvet

The ambitious Spider in his sullen web; the lucky golden Spinner;

The Earwig armd: the tender Maggot emblem of immortality:

The Flea: Louse: Bug: the Tape-Worm: all the Armies of Disease:

Visible or invisible to the slothful vegetating Man.

The slow Slug: the Grasshopper that sings & laughs & drinks:

20    Winter comes, he folds his slender bones without a murmur.

The cruel Scorpion is there: the Gnat: Wasp: Hornet & the Honey Bee:

The Toad & venomous Newt; the Serpent clothd in gems & gold:

They throw off their gorgeous raiment: they rejoice with loud jubilee

Around the Wine-presses of Luvah, naked & drunk with wine.

There is the Nettle that stings with soft down; and there

The indignant Thistle: whose bitterness is bred in his milk:

Who feeds on contempt of his neighbour: there all the idle Weeds

That creep around the obscure places, shew their various limbs.

Naked in all their beauty dancing round the Wine-presses.

30    But in the Wine-presses the Human grapes sing not, nor dance

They howl & writhe in shoals of torment; in fierce flames consuming,

In chains of iron & in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires.

In pits & dens & shades of death: in shapes of torment & woe.

The plates & screws & wracks & saws & cords & fires & cisterns

The cruel joys of Luvahs Daughters lacerating with knives

And whips their Victims & the deadly sport of Luvahs Sons.

They dance around the dying, & they drink the howl & groan

They catch the shrieks in cups of gold, they hand them to one another:

These are the sports of love, & these the sweet delights of amorous play

40    Tears of the grape, the death sweat of the cluster the last sigh

Of the mild youth who listens to the lureing songs of Luvah

But Allamanda calld on Earth Commerce, is the Cultivated land

Around the City of Golgonooza in the Forests of Entuthon:

Here the Sons of Los labour against Death Eternal; through all

The Twenty-seven Heavens of Beulah in Ulro, Seat of Satan,

Which is the False Tongue beneath Beulah: it is the Sense of Touch:

The Plow goes forth in tempests & lightnings & the Harrow cruel

In blights of the east; the heavy Roller follows in howlings of woe.

Urizens sons here labour also; & here are seen the Mills

50    Of Theotormon, on the verge of the Lake of Udan-Adan:

These are the starry voids of night & the depths & caverns of earth

These Mills are oceans, clouds & waters ungovernable in their fury

Here are the stars created & the seeds of all things planted

And here the Sun & Moon recieve their fixed destinations

But in Eternity the Four Arts: Poetry, Painting, Music,

And Architecture which is Science: are the Four Faces of Man.

Not so in Time & Space: there Three are shut out, and only

Science remains thro Mercy: & by means of Science, the Three

Become apparent in Time & Space, in the Three Professions

60    Poetry in Religion: Music, Law: Painting, in Physic & Surgery:

That Man may live upon Earth till the time of his awaking,

And from these Three, Science derives every Occupation of Men.

And Science is divided into Bowlahoola & Allamanda.

PLATE 28

Some Sons of Los surround the Passions with porches of iron & silver

Creating form & beauty around the dark regions of sorrow,

Giving to airy nothing a name and a habitation

Delightful: with bounds to the Infinite putting off the Indefinite

Into most holy forms of Thought: \(such is the power of inspiration\)

They labour incessant; with many tears & afflictions:

Creating the beautiful House for the piteous sufferer.

Others: Cabinets richly fabricate of gold & ivory;

For Doubts & fears unform’d & wretched & melancholy

10    The little weeping Spectre stands on the threshold of Death

Eternal; and sometimes two Spectres like lamps quivering

And often malignant they combat \(heart-breaking sorrowful & piteous\)

Antamon takes them into his beautiful flexible hands,

As the Sower takes the seed, or as the Artist his clay

Or fine wax, to mould artful a model for golden ornaments.

The soft hands of Antamon draw the indelible line:

Form immortal with golden pen; such as the Spectre admiring

Puts on the sweet form; then smiles Antamon bright thro his windows

The Daughters of beauty look up from their Loom & prepare.

20    The integument soft for its clothing with joy & delight.

But Theotormon & Sotha stand in the Gate of Luban anxious

Their numbers are seven million & seven thousand & seven hundred

They contend with the weak Spectres, they fabricate soothing forms

The Spectre refuses, he seeks cruelty, they create the crested Cock

Terrified the Spectre screams & rushes in fear into their Net

Of kindness & compassion & is born a weeping terror.

Or they create the Lion & Tyger in compassionate thunderings

Howling the Spectres flee: they take refuge in Human lineaments.

The Sons of Ozoth within the Optic Nerve stand fiery glowing

30    And the number of his Sons is eight millions & eight.

They give delights to the man unknown; artificial riches

They give to scorn, & their posessors to trouble & sorrow & care,

Shutting the sun, & moon, & stars, & trees, & clouds, & waters,

And hills, out from the Optic Nerve & hardening it into a bone

Opake, and like the black pebble on the enraged beach.

While the poor indigent is like the diamond which tho cloth’d

In rugged covering in the mine, is open all within

And in his hallowd center holds the heavens of bright eternity

Ozoth here builds walls of rocks against the surging sea

40    And timbers crampt with iron cramps bar in the joys of life

From fell destruction in the Spectrous cunning or rage.

He Creates

The speckled Newt, the Spider & Beetle, the Rat & Mouse,

The Badger & Fox: they worship before his feet in trembling fear.

But others of the Sons of Los build Moments & Minutes & Hours

And Days & Months & Years & Ages & Periods; wondrous buildings

And every Moment has a Couch of gold for soft repose,

\(A Moment equals a pulsation of the artery\)

And between every two Moments stands a Daughter of Beulah

To feed the Sleepers on their Couches with maternal care.

50    And every Minute has an azure Tent with silken Veils.

And every Hour has a bright golden Gate carved with skill.

And every Day & Night, has Walls of brass & Gates of adamant,

Shining like precious stones & ornamented with appropriate signs:

And every Month, a silver paved Terrace builded high:

And every Year, invulnerable Barriers with high Towers.

And every Age is Moated deep with Bridges of silver & gold:

And every Seven Ages is Incircled with a Flaming Fire.

Now Seven Ages is amounting to Two Hundred Years

Each has its Guard, each Moment Minute Hour Day Month & Year.

60    All are the work of Fairy hands of the Four Elements

The Guard are Angels of Providence on duty evermore

Every Time less than a pulsation of the artery

Is equal in its period & value to Six Thousand Years.

PLATE 29

For in this Period the Poets Work is Done: and all the Great

Events of Time start forth & are concievd in such a Period

Within a Moment: a Pulsation of the Artery.

The Sky is an immortal Tent built by the Sons of Los

And every Space that a Man views around his dwelling-place:

Standing on his own roof, or in his garden on a mount

Of twenty-five cubits in height, such space is his Universe;

And on its verge the Sun rises & sets, the Clouds bow

To meet the flat Earth & the Sea in such an orderd Space:

10    The Starry heavens reach no further but here bend and set

On all sides & the two Poles turn on their valves of gold:

And if he move his dwelling-place, his heavens also move,

Wher’eer he goes & all his neighbourhood bewail his loss:

Such are the Spaces called Earth & such its dimension:

As to that false appearance which appears to the reasoner,

As of a Globe rolling thro Voidness, it is a delusion of Ulro

The Microscope knows not of this nor the Telescope. they alter

The ratio of the Spectators Organs but leave Objects untouchd

For every Space larger than a red Globule of Mans blood,

20    Is visionary: and is created by the Hammer of Los

And every Space smaller than a Globule of Mans blood, opens

Into Eternity of which this vegetable Earth is but a shadow:

The red Globule is the unwearied Sun by Los created

To measure Time and Space to mortal Men. every morning.

Bowlahoola & Allamanda are placed on each side

Of that Pulsation & that Globule, terrible their power.

But Rintrah & Palamabron govern over Day & Night

In Allamanda & Entuthon Benython where Souls wail:

Where Orc incessant howls burning in fires of Eternal Youth,

30    Within the vegetated mortal Nerves; for every Man born is joined

Within into One mighty Polypus, and this Polypus is Orc.

But in the Optic vegetative Nerves Sleep was transformed

To Death in old time by Satan the father of Sin & Death

And Satan is the Spectre of Orc & Orc is the generate Luvah

But in the Nerves of the Nostrils, Accident being Formed

Into Substance & Principle, by the cruelties of Demonstration

It became Opake & Indefinite; but the Divine Saviour,

Formed it into a Solid by Los’s Mathematic power.

He named the Opake Satan: he named the Solid Adam

40    And in the Nerves of the Ear, \(for the Nerves of the Tongue are closed\)

On Albions Rock Los stands creating the glorious Sun each morning

And when unwearied in the evening he creates the Moon

Death to delude, who all in terror at their splendor leaves

His prey while Los appoints, & Rintrah & Palamabron guide

The Souls clear from the Rock of Death, that Death himself may wake

In his appointed season when the ends of heaven meet.

Then Los conducts the Spirits to be Vegetated, into

Great Golgonooza, free from the four iron pillars of Satans Throne

\(Temperance, Prudence, Justice, Fortitude, the four pillars of tyranny\)

50    That Satans Watch-Fiends touch them not before they Vegetate.

But Enitharmon and her Daughters take the pleasant charge.

To give them to their lovely heavens till the Great Judgment Day

Such is their lovely charge. But Rahab & Tirzah pervert

Their mild influences, therefore the Seven Eyes of God walk round

The Three Heavens of Ulro, where Tirzah & her Sisters

Weave the black Woof of Death upon Entuthon Benython

In the Vale of Surrey where Horeb terminates in Rephaim

The stamping feet of Zelophehads Daughters are coverd with Human gore

Upon the treddles of the Loom, they sing to the winged shuttle:

60    The River rises above his banks to wash the Woof:

He takes it in his arms: he passes it in strength thro his current

The veil of human miseries is woven over the Ocean

From the Atlantic to the Great South Sea, the Erythrean.

Such is the World of Los the labour of six thousand years.

Thus Nature is a Vision of the Science of the Elohim.

End of the First Book.



PLATE 30

MILTON

BOOK THE SECOND

There is a place where Contrarieties are equally True

This place is called Beulah, It is a pleasant lovely Shadow

Where no dispute can come, Because of those who Sleep.

Into this place the Sons & Daughters of Ololon descended

With solemn mourning, into Beulahs moony shades & hills

Weeping for Milton: mute wonder held the Daughters of Beulah

Enrapturd with affection sweet and mild benevolence

Beulah is evermore Created around Eternity; appearing

To the inhabitants of Eden, around them on all sides.

10    But Beulah to its Inhabitants appears within each district

As the beloved infant in his mothers bosom round incircled

With arms of love & pity & sweet compassion. But to

The Sons of Eden the moony habitations of Beulah,

Are from Great Eternity a mild & pleasant Rest.

And it is thus Created. Lo the Eternal Great Humanity

To whom be Glory & Dominion Evermore Amen

Walks among all his awful Family seen in every face

As the breath of the Almighty, such are the words of man to man

In the great Wars of Eternity, in fury of Poetic Inspiration,

20    To build the Universe stupendous: Mental forms Creating

But the Emanations trembled exceedingly, nor could they

Live, because the life of Man was too exceeding unbounded

His joy became terrible to them, they trembled & wept

Crying with one voice. Give us a habitation & a place

In which we may be hidden under the shadow of wings

For if we who are but for a time, & who pass away in winter

Behold these wonders of Eternity we shall consume

But you O our Fathers & Brothers, remain in Eternity

But grant us a Temporal Habitation. do you speak

30    To us; we will obey your words as you obey Jesus

The Eternal who is blessed for ever & ever. Amen

So spake the lovely Emanations; & there appeard a pleasant

Mild Shadow above: beneath: & on all sides round,

PLATE 31

Into this pleasant Shadow all the weak & weary

Like Women & Children were taken away as on wings

Of dovelike softness, & shadowy habitations prepared for them

But every Man returnd & went still going forward thro’

The Bosom of the Father in Eternity on Eternity

Neither did any lack or fall into Error without

A Shadow to repose in all the Days of happy Eternity

Into this pleasant Shadow Beulah, all Ololon descended

And when the Daughters of Beulah heard the lamentation

10    All Beulah wept, for they saw the Lord coming in the Clouds

And the Shadows of Beulah terminate in rocky Albion.

And all Nations wept in affliction Family by Family

Germany wept towards France & Italy: England wept & trembled

Towards America: India rose up from his golden bed:

As one awakend in the night: they saw the Lord coming

In the Clouds of Ololon with Power & Great Glory\!

And all the Living Creatures of the Four Elements, wail’d

With bitter wailing: these in the aggregate are named Satan

And Rahab: they know not of Regeneration, but only of Generation

20    The Fairies, Nymphs, Gnomes & Genii of the Four Elements

Unforgiving & unalterable: these cannot be Regenerated

But must be Created, for they know only of Generation

These are the Gods of the Kingdoms of the Earth: in contrarious

And cruel opposition: Element against Element, opposed in War

Not Mental, as the Wars of Eternity, but a Corporeal Strife

In Los’s Halls continual labouring in the Furnaces of Golgonooza

Orc howls on the Atlantic: Enitharmon trembles: All Beulah weeps

Thou hearest the Nightingale begin the Song of Spring;

The Lark sitting upon his earthy bed: just as the morn

30    Appears; listens silent; then springing from the waving Corn-field\! loud

He leads the Choir of the Day: trill, trill, trill, trill,

Mounting upon the wings of light into the Great Expanse:

Reecchoing against the lovely blue & shining heavenly Shell:

His little throat labours with inspiration; every feather

On throat & breast & wings vibrates with the effluence Divine

All Nature listens silent to him & the awful Sun

Stands still upon the Mountain looking on this little Bird

With eyes of soft humility, & wonder love & awe.

Then loud from their green covert all the Birds begin their Song

40    The Thrush, the Linnet & the Goldfinch, Robin & the Wren

Awake the Sun from his sweet reverie upon the Mountain:

The Nightingale again assays his song & thro the day,

And thro the night warbles luxuriant; every Bird of Song

Attending his loud harmony with admiration & love.

This is a Vision of the lamentation of Beulah over Ololon\!

Thou percievest the Flowers put forth their precious Odours\!

And none can tell how from so small a center comes such sweets

Forgetting that within that Center Eternity expands

Its ever during doors, that Og & Anak fiercely guard\[.\]

50    First eer the morning breaks joy opens in the flowery bosoms

Joy even to tears, which the Sun rising dries; first the Wild Thyme

And Meadow-sweet downy & soft waving among the reeds.

Light springing on the air lead the sweet Dance: they wake

The Honeysuckle sleeping on the Oak: the flaunting beauty

Revels along upon the wind; the White-thorn lovely May

Opens her many lovely eyes: listening the Rose still sleeps

None dare to wake her. soon she bursts her crimson curtaind bed

60    And comes forth in the majesty of beauty; every Flower:

The Pink, the Jessamine, the Wall-flower, the Carnation

The Jonquil, the mild Lilly opes her heavens: every Tree,

And Flower & Herb soon fill the air with an innumerable Dance

Yet all in order sweet & lovely, Men are sick with Love\!

Such is a Vision of the lamentation of Beulah over Ololon

PLATE 32

And Milton oft sat up on the Couch of Death & oft conversed

In vision & dream beatific with the Seven Angels of the Presence

I have turned my back upon these Heavens builded on cruelty

My Spectre still wandering thro’ them follows my Emanation

He hunts her footsteps thro’ the snow & the wintry hail & rain

The idiot Reasoner laughs at the Man of Imagination

And from laughter proceeds to murder by undervaluing Calunmy

Then Hillel who is Lucifer replied over the Couch of Death

And thus the Seven Angels instructed him & thus they converse.

10    We are not Individuals but States: Combinations of Individuals

We were Angels of the Divine Presence: & were Druids in Annandale

Compelld to combine into Form by Satan, the Spectre of Albion,

Who made himself a God &, destroyed the Human Form Divine.

But the Divine Humanity & Mercy gave us a Human Form

Because we were combined in Freedom & holy Brotherhood

![image](images/000007.jpg)

While those combind by Satans Tyranny first in the blood of War

And Sacrifice &, next, in Chains of imprisonment: are Shapeless Rocks

Retaining only Satans Mathematic Holiness, Length: Bredth & Highth

Calling the Human Imagination: which is the Divine Vision & Fruition

20    In which Man liveth eternally: madness & blasphemy, against                    

Its own Qualities, which are Servants of Humanity, not Gods or Lords\[.\]

Distinguish therefore States from Individuals in those States.

States Change: but Individual Identities never change nor cease:

You cannot go to Eternal Death in that which can never Die.

Satan & Adam are States Created into Twenty-seven Churches

And thou O Milton art a State about to be Created

Called Eternal Annihilation that none but the Living shall

Dare to enter: & they shall enter triumphant over Death

And Hell & the Grave: States that are not, but ah\! Seem to be.

30    Judge then of thy Own Self: thy Eternal Lineaments explore                  

What is Eternal & what Changeable? & what Annihilable:

The Imagination is not a State: it is the Human Existence itself

Affection or Love becomes a State, when divided from Imagination

The Memory is a State always, & the Reason is a State

Created to be Annihilated & a new Ratio Created

Whatever can be Created can be Annihilated Forms cannot

The Oak is cut down by the Ax, the Lamb falls by the Knife

But their Forms Eternal Exist, For-ever. Amen Halle\[l\]ujah

Thus they converse with the Dead watching round the Couch of Death.

40    For God himself enters Death’s Door always with those that enter                       

And lays down in the Grave with them, in Visions of Eternity

Till they awake & see Jesus & the Linen Clothes lying

That the Females had Woven for them, & the Gates of their Fathers House

PLATE 33

And the Divine Voice was heard in the Songs of Beulah Saying

When I first Married you, I gave you all my whole Soul

I thought that you would love my loves & joy in my delights

Seeking for pleasures in my pleasures O Daughter of Babylon

Then thou wast lovely, mild & gentle, now thou art terrible

In jealousy & unlovely in my sight, because thou hast cruelly

Cut off my loves in fury till I have no love left for thee

Thy love depends on him thou lovest & on his dear loves

Depend thy pleasures which thou hast cut off by jealousy

10    Therefore I shew my Jealousy & set before you Death.

Behold Milton descended to Redeem the Female Shade

From Death Eternal; such your lot, to be continually Redeem’d

By death & misery of those you love & by Annihilation

When the Sixfold Female percieves that Milton annihilates

20    Himself: that seeing all his loves by her cut off: he leaves

Her also: intirely abstracting himself from Female loves

She shall relent in fear of death: She shall begin to give

Her maidens to her husband: delighting in his delight

And then & then alone begins the happy Female joy

As it is done in Beulah, & thou O Virgin Babylon Mother of Whoredoms                     

Shalt bring Jerusalem in thine arms in the night watches; and

No longer turning her a wandering Harlot in the streets

Shalt give her into the arms of God your Lord & Husband.

Such are the Songs of Beulah in the Lamentations of Ololon

PLATE 34

10    And all the Songs of Beulah sounded comfortable notes

To comfort Ololons lamentation, for they said

Are you the Fiery Circle that late drove in fury & fire

The Eight Immortal Starry-Ones down into Ulro dark

Rending the Heavens of Beulah with your thunders & lightnings

And can you thus lament & can you pity & forgive?

Is terror changd to pity O wonder of Eternity:

And the Four States of Humanity in its Repose,

Were shewed them. First of Beulah a most pleasant Sleep

On Couches soft, with mild music, tended by Flowers of Beulah

Sweet Female forms, winged or floating in the air spontaneous

The Second State is Alia & the third State Al-Ulro;

But the Fourth State is dreadful; it is named Or-Ulro:

The First State is in the Head, the Second is in the Heart:

The Third in the Loins & Seminal Vessels & the Fourth

In the Stomach & Intestines terrible, deadly, unutterable

And he whose Gates are opend in those Regions of his Body

Can from those Gates view all these wondrous Imaginations

But Ololon sought the Or-Ulro & its fiery Gates

20    And the Couches of the Martyrs: & many Daughters of Beulah

Accompany them down to the Ulro with soft melodious tears

A long journey & dark thro Chaos in the track of Miltons course

To where the Contraries of Beulah War beneath Negations Banner

Then view’d from Miltons Track they see the Ulro: a vast Polypus

Of living fibres down into the Sea of Time & Space growing

A self-devouring monstrous Human Death Twenty-seven fold\[.\]

Within it sit Five Females & the nameless Shadowy Mother

Spinning it from their bowels with songs of amorous delight

And melting cadences that lure the Sleepers of Beulah down

30    The River Storge \(which is Arnon\) into the Dead Sea:

Around this Polypus Los continual builds the Mundane Shell

Four Universes round the Universe of Los remain Chaotic

Four intersecting Globes, & the Egg form’d World of Los

In midst; stretching from Zenith to Nadir, in midst of Chaos\[.\]

One of these Ruind Universes is to the North named Urthona

One to the South this was the glorious World of Urizen

One to the East, of Luvah: One to the West; of Tharmas.

But when Luvah assumed the World of Urizen in the South

All fell towards the Center sinking downward in dire Ruin

40    Here in these Chaoses the Sons of Ololon took their abode

In Chasms of the Mundane Shell which open on all sides round

Southward & by the East within the Breach of Miltons descent

To watch the time, pitying & gentle to awaken Urizen

They stood in a dark land of death of fiery corroding waters

Where lie in evil death the Four Immortals pale and cold

And the Eternal Man, even Albion, upon the Rock of Ages\[.\]

Seeing Miltons Shadow, some Daughters of Beulah trembling

Returnd, but Ololon remaind before the Gates of the Dead

And Ololon looked down into the Heavens of Ulro in fear

50    They said. How are the Wars of man which in Great Eternity

Appear around, in the External Spheres of Visionary Life

Here renderd Deadly within the Life & Interior Vision

How are the Beasts & Birds & Fishes, & Plants & Minerals

Here fixd into a frozen bulk subject to decay & death

Those Visions of Human Life & Shadows of Wisdom & Knowledge

PLATE 35

Are here frozen to unexpansive deadly destroying terrors

And War & Hunting: the Two Fountains of the River of Life

Are become Fountains of bitter Death & of corroding Hell

Till Brotherhood is changd into a Curse & a Flattery

By Differences between Ideas, that Ideas themselves, \(which are

The Divine Members\) may be slain in offerings for sin

O dreadful Loom of Death\! O piteous Female forms compelld

To weave the Woof of Death. On Camberwell Tirzahs Courts

Malahs on Blackheath, Rahab & Noah, dwell on Windsors heights

10    Where once the Cherubs of Jerusalem spread to Lambeths Vale                       

Milcahs Pillars shine from Harrow to Hampstead where Hoglah

On Highgates heights magnificent Weaves over trembling Thames

To Shooters Hill and thence to Blackheath the dark Woof\! Loud

Loud roll the Weights & Spindles over the whole Earth let down

On all sides round to the Four Quarters of the World, eastward on

Europe to Euphrates & Hindu, to Nile & back in Clouds

Of Death across the Atlantic to America North & South

So spake Ololon in reminiscence astonishd, but they

Could not behold Golgonooza without passing the Polypus

20    A wondrous journey not passable by Immortal feet, & none

But the Divine Saviour can pass it without annihilation.

For Golgonooza cannot be seen till having passd the Polypus

It is viewed on all sides round by a Four-fold Vision

Or till you become Mortal & Vegetable in Sexuality

Then you behold its mighty Spires & Domes of ivory & gold

And Ololon examined all the Couches of the Dead.

Even of Los & Enitharmon & all the Sons of Albion

And his Four Zoas terrified & on the verge of Death

In midst of these was Miltons Couch, & when they saw Eight

30    Immortal Starry-Ones, guarding the Couch in flaming fires

They thunderous utterd all a universal groan falling down

Prostrate before the Starry Eight asking with tears forgiveness

Confessing their crime with humiliation and sorrow.

O how the Starry Eight rejoic’d to see Ololon descended\!

And now that a wide road was open to Eternity,

By Ololons descent thro Beulah to Los & Enitharmon.

For mighty were the multitudes of Ololon, vast the extent

Of their great sway, reaching from Ulro to Eternity

Surrounding the Mundane Shell outside in its Caverns

40    And through Beulah. and all silent forbore to contend

With Ololon for they saw the Lord in the Clouds of Ololon

There is a Moment in each Day that Satan cannot find

Nor can his Watch Fiends find it, but the Industrious find

This Moment & it multiply. & when it once is found

It renovates every Moment of the Day if rightly placed

In this Moment Ololon descended to Los & Enitharmon

Unseen beyond the Mundane Shell Southward in Miltons track

Just in this Moment when the morning odours rise abroad

And first from the Wild Thyme, stands a Fountain in a rock

50    Of crystal flowing into two Streams, one flows thro Golgonooza

And thro Beulah to Eden beneath Los’s western Wall

The other flows thro the Aerial Void & all the Churches

Meeting again in Golgonooza beyond Satans Seat

The Wild Thyme is Los’s Messenger to Eden, a mighty Demon

Terrible deadly & poisonous his presence in Ulro dark

Therefore he appears only a small Root creeping in grass

Covering over the Rock of Odours his bright purple mantle

Beside the Fount above the Larks nest in Golgonooza

Luvah slept here in death & here is Luvahs empty Tomb

60    Ololon sat beside this Fountain on the Rock of Odours.

Just at the place to where the Lark mounts, is a Crystal Gate

It is the enterance of the First Heaven named Luther: for

The Lark is Los’s Messenger thro the Twenty-seven Churches

That the Seven Eyes of God who walk even to Satans Seat

Thro all the Twenty-seven Heavens may not slumber nor sleep

But the Larks Nest is at the Gate of Los, at the eastern

Gate of wide Golgonooza & the Lark is Los’s Messenger

PLATE 36

When on the highest lift of his light pinions he arrives

At that bright Gate, another Lark meets him & back to back

They touch their pinions tip tip: and each descend

To their respective Earths & there all night consult with Angels

Of Providence & with the Eyes of God all night in slumbers

Inspired: & at the dawn of day send out another Lark

Into another Heaven to carry news upon his wings

Thus are the Messengers dispatchd till they reach the Earth again

In the East Gate of Golgonooza, & the Twenty-eighth bright

10    Lark, met the Female Ololon descending into my Garden                     

Thus it appears to Mortal eyes & those of the Ulro Heavens

But not thus to Immortals. the Lark is a mighty Angel

For Ololon step’d into the Polypus within the Mundane Shell

They could not step into Vegetable Worlds without becoming

The enemies of Humanity except in a Female Form

And as One Female, Ololon and all its mighty Hosts

Appear’d: a Virgin of twelve years nor time nor space was

To the perception of the Virgin Ololon but as the

Flash of lightning but more quick the Virgin in my Garden

20    Before my Cottage stood, for the Satanic Space is delusion

For when Los joind with me he took me in his firy whirlwind

My Vegetated portion was hurried from Lambeths shades

He set me down in Felphams Vale & prepard a beautiful

Cottage for me that in three years I might write all these Visions

To display Natures cruel holiness: the deceits of Natural Religion\[.\]

Walking in my Cottage Garden, sudden I beheld

The Virgin Ololon & address’d her as a Daughter of Beulah

Virgin of Providence fear not to enter into my Cottage

What is thy message to thy friend? What am I now to do

30    Is it again to plunge into deeper affliction? behold me

Ready to obey, but pity thou my Shadow of Delight

Enter my Cottage, comfort her, for she is sick with fatigue

PLATE 37

The Virgin answerd. Knowest thou of Milton who descended

Driven from Eternity; him I seek\! terrified at my Act

In Great Eternity which thou knowest\! I come him to seek

So Ololon utterd in words distinct the anxious thought

Mild was the voice, but more distinct than any earthly

That Miltons Shadow heard & condensing all his Fibres

Into a strength impregnable of majesty & beauty infinite

I saw he was the Covering Cherub and within him Satan

And Raha\[b\], in an outside which is fallacious\! within

10    Beyond the outline of Identity, in the Selfhood deadly

And he appeard the Wicker Man of Scandinavia in whom

Jerusalems children consume in flames among the Stars

Descending down into my Garden, a Human Wonder of God

Reaching from heaven to earth a Cloud & Human Form

I beheld Milton with astonishment & in him beheld

The Monstrous Churches of Beulah, the Gods of Ulro dark

Twelve monstrous dishumanizd terrors Synagogues of Satan.

A Double Twelve & Thrice Nine: such their divisions.

And these their Names & their Places within the Mundane Shell



20    In Tyre & Sidon I saw Baal & Ashtaroth. In Moab Chemosh

In Ammon, Molech: loud his Furnaces rage among the Wheels

Of Og, & pealing loud the cries of the Victims of Fire:

And pale his Priestesses infolded in Veils of Pestilence, border’d

With War; Woven in Looms of Tyre & Sidon by beautiful Ashtaroth.

In Palestine Dagon, Sea Monster\! worshipd o’er the Sea.

Thammuz in Lebanon & Rimmon in Damascus curtaind

Osiris: Isis: Orus: in Egypt: dark their Tabernacles on Nile

Floating with solemn songs, & on the Lakes of Egypt nightly

With pomp, even till morning break & Osiris appear in the sky

30    But Belial of Sodom & Gomorrha, obscure Demon of Bribes

And secret Assasinations, not worshipd nor adord; but

With the finger on the lips & the back turnd to the light

And Saturn Jove & Rhea of the Isles of the Sea remote

These Twelve Gods, are the Twelve Spectre Sons of the Druid Albion

And these the names of the Twenty-seven Heavens & their Churches

Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch,

Methuselah, Lamech: these are Giants mighty Hermaphroditic

Noah, Shem, Arphaxad, Cainan the second, Salah, Heber,

Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah, these are the Female-Males

40    A Male within a Female hid as in an Ark & Curtains,

Abraham, Moses, Solomon, Paul, Constantine, Charlemaine

Luther, these seven are the Male-Females, the Dragon Forms

Religion hid in War, a Dragon red & hidden Harlot

All these are seen in Miltons Shadow who is the Covering Cherub

The Spectre of Albion in which the Spectre of Luvah inhabits

In the Newtonian Voids between the Substances of Creation

For the Chaotic Voids outside of the Stars are measured by

The Stars, which are the boundaries of Kingdoms, Provinces

And Empires of Chaos invisible in the Vegetable Man

50    The Kingdom of Og, is in Orion: Sihon is in Ophiucus

Og has Twenty-seven Districts; Sihons Districts Twenty-one

From Star to Star, Mountains & Valleys, terrible dimension

Stretchd out, compose the Mundane Shell, a mighty Incrustation

Of Forty-eight deformed Human Wonders of the Almighty

With Caverns whose remotest bottoms meet again beyond

The Mundane Shell in Golgonooza, but the Fires of Los, rage

In the remotest bottoms of the Caves, that none can pass

Into Eternity that way, but all descend to Los

To Bowlahoola & Allamanda & to Entuthon Benython

60    The Heavens are the Cherub, the Twelve Gods are Satan

PLATE 38

And the Forty-eight Starry Regions are Cities of the Levites

The Heads of the Great Polypus, Four-fold twelve enormity

In mighty & mysterious comingling enemy with enemy

Woven by Urizen into Sexes from his mantle of years

And Milton collecting all his fibres into impregnable strength

Descended down a Paved work of all kinds of precious stones

Out from the eastern sky; descending down into my Cottage

Garden: clothed in black, severe & silent he descended.

The Spectre of Satan stood upon the roaring sea & beheld

10    Milton within his sleeping Humanity: trembling & sbuddring

He stood upon the waves a Twenty-seven-fold mighty Demon

Gorgeous & beautiful: loud roll his thunders against Milton

Loud Satan thunderd, loud & dark upon mild Felpham shore

Not daring to touch one fibre he howld round upon the Sea.

I also stood in Satans bosom & beheld its desolations\!

A ruind Man: a ruind building of God not made with hands;

Its plains of burning sand, its mountains of marble terrible:

Its pits & declivities flowing with molten orc & fountains

Of pitch & nitre: its ruind palaces & cities & mighty works;

20    Its furnaces of affliction in which his Angels & Emanations

Labour with blackend visages among its stupendous ruins

Arches & pyramids & porches colonades & domes:

In which dwells Mystery Babylon, here is her secret place

From hence she comes forth on the Churches in delight

Here is her Cup filld with its poisons, in these horrid vales

And here her scarlet Veil woven in pestilence & war:

Here is Jerusalem bound in chains, in the Dens of Babylon

In the Eastern porch of Satans Universe Milton stood &said

Satan\! my Spectre\! I know my power thee to annihilate

30    And be a greater in thy place, & be thy Tabernacle

A covering for thee to do thy will, till one greater comes

And smites me as I smote thee & becomes my covering.

Such are the Laws of thy false Heavns\! but Laws of Eternity

Are not such: know thou: I come to Self Annihilation

Such are the Laws of Eternity that each shall mutually

Annihilate himself for others good, as I for thee\[.\]

Thy purpose & the purpose of thy Priests & of thy Churches

Is to impress on men the fear of death; to teach

Trembling & fear, terror, constriction; abject selfishness

40    Mine is to teach Men to despise death & to go on

In fearless majesty annihilating Self, laughing to scorn

Thy Laws & terrors, shaking down thy Synagogues as webs

I come to discover before Heavn & Hell the Self righteousness

In all its Hypocritic turpitude, opening to every eye

These wonders of Satans holiness shewing to the Earth

The Idol Virtues of the Natural Heart, & Satans Seat

Explore in all its Selfish Natural Virtue & put off

In Self annihilation all that is not of God alone:

To put off Self & all I have ever & ever Amen

50    Satan heard\! Coming in a cloud, with trumpets & flaming fire,

Saying I am God the judge of all, the living & the dead

Fall therefore down & worship me. submit thy supreme

Dictate, to my eternal Will & to my dictate bow

I hold the Balances of Right & Just & mine the Sword

Seven Angels bear my Name & in those Seven I appear

But I alone am God & I alone in Heavn & Earth

Of all that live dare utter this, others tremble & bow

PLATE 39

Till All Things become One Great Satan, in Holiness

Oppos’d to Mercy, and the Divine Delusion Jesus be no more

Suddenly around Milton on my Path, the Starry Seven

Burnd terrible\! my Path became a solid fire, as bright

As the clear Sun & Milton silent came down on my Path.

And there went forth from the Starry limbs of the Seven: Forms

Human; with Trumpets innumerable, sounding articulate

As the Seven spake; and they stood in a mighty Column of Fire

Surrounding Felphams Vale, reaching to the Mundane Shell, Saying

10    Awake Albion awake\! reclaim thy Reasoning Spectre. Subdue

Him to the Divine Mercy, Cast him down into the Lake

Of Los, that ever burneth with fire, ever & ever Amen\!

Let the Four Zoa’s awake from Slumbers of Six Thousand Years

Then loud the Furnaces of Los were heard\! & seen as Seven Heavens

Stretching from south to north over the mountains of Albion

Satan heard; trembling round his Body, he incircled it

He trembled with exceeding great trembling & astonishment

Howling in his Spectre round his Body hungring to devour

But fearing for the pain for if he touches a Vital,

20    His torment is unendurable: therefore he cannot devour:

But howls round it as a lion round his prey continually.

Loud Satan thunderd, loud & dark upon mild Felphams Shore

Coming in a Cloud with Trumpets & with Fiery Flame

An awful Form eastward from midst of a bright Paved-work

Of precious stones by Cherubim surrounded: so permitted

\(Lest he should fall apart in his Eternal Death\) to imitate

The Eternal Great Humanity Divine surrounded by

His Cherubim & Seraphim in every happy Eternity

Beneath sat Chaos: Sin on his right hand Death on his left

30    And Ancient Night spread over all the heavn his Mantle of Laws

He trembled with exceeding great trembling & astonishment

Then Albion rose up in the Night of Beulah on his Couch

Of dread repose seen by the visionary eye; his face is toward

The east, toward Jerusalems Gates: groaning he sat above

His rocks. London & Bath & Legions & Edinburgh

Are the four pillars of his Throne; his left foot near London

Covers the shades of Tyburn: his instep from Windsor

To Primrose Hill stretching to Highgate & Holloway

London is between his knees: its basements fourfold

40    His right foot stretches to the sea on Dover cliffs, his heel

On Canterbutys ruins; his right hand covers lofty Wales

His left Scotland; his bosom girt with gold involves

York, Edinburgh, Durham & Carlisle & on the front

Bath, Oxford, Cambridge, Norwich; his right elbow

Leans on the Rocks of Erins Land, Ireland ancient nation\[.\]

His head bends over London: he sees his embodied Spectre

Trembling before him with exceeding great trembling & fear

He views Jerusalem & Babylon, his tears flow down

He movd his right foot to Cornwall, his left to the Rocks of Bognor

50    He strove to rise to walk into the Deep. but strength failing

Forbad & down with dreadful groans he sunk upon his Couch

In moony Beulah. Los his strong Guard walks round beneath the Moon

Urizen faints in terror striving among the Brooks of Arnon

With Miltons Spirit: as the Plowman or Artificer or Shepherd

While in the labours of his Calling sends his Thought abroad

To labour in the ocean or in the starry heaven, So Milton

Labourd in Chasms of the Mundane Shell, tho here before

My Cottage midst the Starry Seven, where the Virgin Ololon

Stood trembling in the Porch: loud Satan thunder’d on the stormy Sea

60    Circling Albions Cliffs in which the Four-fold World resides

Tho seen in fallacy outside: a fallacy of Satans Churches

PLATE 40

Before Ololon Milton stood & percievd the Eternal Form

Of that mild Vision; wondrous were their acts by me unknown

Except remotely; and I heard Ololon say to Milton

I see thee strive upon the Brooks of Arnon. there a dread

And awful Man I see, oercoverd with the mantle of years.

I behold Los & Urizen. I behold Orc & Tharmas\!

The Four Zoa’s of Albion & thy Spirit with them striving

In Self annihilation giving thy life to thy enemies

Are those who contemn Religion & seek to annihilate it

10    Become in their Femin\[in\]e portions the causes & promoters

Of these Religions, how is this thing? this Newtonian Phantasm

This Voltaire & Rousseau: this Hume & Gibbon & Bolingbroke

This Natural Religion\! this impossible absurdity

Is Ololon the cause of this? O where shall I hide my face

These tears fall for the little-ones: the Children of Jerusalem

Lest they be annihilated in thy annihilation.

No sooner she had spoke but Rahab Babylon appeard

Eastward upon the Paved work across Europe & Asia

Glorious as the midday Sun in Satans bosom glowing

20    A Female hidden in a Male, Religion hidden in War

Namd Moral Virtue; cruel two-fold Monster shining bright

A Dragon red & hidden Harlot which John in Patmos saw

And all beneath the Nations innumerable of Ulro

Appeard, the Seven Kingdoms of Canaan & Five Baalim

Of Philistea, into Twelve divided, calld after the Names

Of Israel: as they are in Eden, Mountain, River & Plain

City & sandy Desart intermingled beyond mortal ken

But turning toward Ololon in terrible majesty Milton

Replied. Obey thou the Words of the Inspired Man

30    All that can be annihilated must be annihilated

That the Children of Jerusalem may be saved from slavery

There is a Negation, & there is a Contrary

The Negation must be destroyd to redeem the Contraries

The Negation is the Spectre; the Reasoning Power in Man

This is a false Body: an Incrustation over my Immortal

Spirit; a Selfhood, which must be put off & annihilated alway

To cleanse the Face of my Spirit by Self-examination.

PLATE 41

To bathe in the Waters of Life; to wash off the Not Human

I come in Self-annihilation & the grandeur of Inspiration

To cast off Rational Demonstration by Faith in the Saviour

To cast off the rotten rags of Memory by Inspiration

To cast off Bacon, Locke & Newton from Albions covering

To take off his filthy garments, & clothe him with Imagination

To cast aside from Poetry, all that is not Inspiration

That it no longer shall dare to mock with the aspersion of Madness

Cast on the Inspired, by the tame high finisher of paltry Blots,

10    Indefinite, or paltry Rhymes; or paltry Harmonies,

Who creeps into State Government like a catterpiller to destroy

To cast off the idiot Questioner who is always questioning,

But never capable of answering; who sits with a sly grin

Silent plotting when to question, like a thief in a cave;

Who publishes doubt & calls it knowledge; whose Science is Despair,

Whose pretence to knowledge is Envy, whose whole Science is

To destroy the wisdom of ages to gratify ravenous Envy

That rages round him like a Wolf day & night without rest

He smiles with condescension; he talks of Benevolence & Virtue

20    And those who act with Benevolence & Virtue, they murder time on time

These are the destroyers of Jerusalem, these are the murderers

Of Jesus, who deny the Faith & mock at Eternal Life:

Who pretend to Poetry that they may destroy Imagination;

By imitation of Natures Images drawn from Remembrance

These are the Sexual Garments, the Abomination of Desolation

Hiding the Human Lineaments as with an Ark & Curtains

Which Jesus rent: & now shall wholly purge away with Fire

Till Generation is swallowd up in Regeneration.

Then trembled the Virgin Ololon & replyd in clouds of despair



30    Is this our Femin\[in\]e Portion the Six-fold Miltonic Female

Terribly this Portion trembles before thee O awful Man

Altho’ our Human Power can sustain the severe contentions

Of Friendship, our Sexual cannot: but flies into the Ulro.

Hence arose all our terrors in Eternity\! & now remembrance

Returns upon us\! are we Contraries O Milton, Thou & I

O Immortal: how were we led to War the Wars of Death

Is this the Void Outside of Existence, which if enter’d into

PLATE 42

Becomes a Womb? & is this the Death Couch of Albion

Thou goest to Eternal Death & all must go with thee

So saying, the Virgin divided Six-fold & with a shriek

Dolorous that ran thro all Creation a Double Six-fold Wonder:

Away from Ololon she divided & fled into the depths

Of Miltons Shadow as a Dove upon the stormy Sea.

Then as a Moony Ark Ololon descended to Felphams Vale

In clouds of blood, in streams of gore, with dreadful thunderings

Into the Fires of Intellect that rejoic’d in Felphams Vale

10    Around the Starry Eight: with one accord the Starry Eight became

One Man Jesus the Saviour. wonderful\! round his limbs

The Clouds of Ololon folded as a Garment dipped in blood

Written within & without in woven letters: & the Writing

Is the Divine Revelation in the Litteral expression:

A Garment of War, I heard it namd the Woof of Six Thousand Years

And I beheld the Twenty-four Cities of Albion

Arise upon their Thrones to Judge the Nations of the Earth

And the Immortal Four in whom the Twenty-four appear Four-fold

Arose around Albions body: Jesus wept & walked forth

20    From Felphams Vale clothed in Clouds of blood, to enter into

Albions Bosom, the bosom of death & the Four surrounded him

In the Column of Fire in Felphams Vale; then to their mouths the Four

Applied their Four Trumpets & them sounded to the Four winds

Terror struck in the Vale I stood at that immortal sound

My bones trembled. I fell outstretchd upon the path

A moment, & my Soul returnd into its mortal state

To Resurrection & Judgment in the Vegetable Body

And my sweet Shadow of Delight stood trembling by my side

Immediately the Lark mounted with a loud trill from Felphams Vale

30    And the Wild Thyme from Wimbletons green & impurpled Hills

And Los & Enitharmon rose over the Hills of Surrey

Their clouds roll over London with a south wind, soft Oothoon

Pants in the Vales of Lambeth weeping oer her Human Harvest

Los listens to the Cry of the Poor Man: his Cloud

Over London in volume terrific, low bended in anger.

Rintrah & Palamabron view the Human Harvest beneath

Their Wine-presses & Barns stand open; the Ovens are prepar’d

The Waggons ready: terrific Lions & Tygers sport & play

All Animals upon the Earth, are prepard in all their strength

O that I neer ha\[d\] seen that William Blake  
Or could from death Assassinetti wake  
We thought Alas that such a thought should be  
That Blake would Etch for him & draw for me  
For twas a kind of Bargain Screwmuch made  
That Blakes designs should be by us displayed  
Because he makes designs so very cheap  
Then Screwmuch at Blakes soul took a long leap  
Twas not a Mouse twas Death in a disguise

40   And I alas live to weep out mine Eyes

And Death sits \[*mocking*\] laughing on their Monuments  
On which hes written Recievd the Contents

But I have writ so sorrowful my thought is  
His Epitaph \[*with tears of*\] for my tears are aqua fortis

\[*Ye*\] Come Artists knock your heads against This stone  
For Sorrow that \[*your*\] our friend Bob Screwmuchs gone  
And now the Men upon me smile & Laugh  
Ill also write my own dear Epitaph  
And Ill be buried near a Dike

50   That my friends may weep as much as they like

Here lies Stewhard the Friend of All &c

\*

Was I angry with Hayley who usd me so ill  
Or can I be angry with Felphams old Mill  
\[*Or angry with Boydell or Bowyer or Ba*\]  
Or angry with Flaxman or Cromek or Stothard  
Or poor Schiavonetti whom they to death botherd  
Or angry with Macklin or Boydel or Bowyer  
Because they did not say O what a Beau ye are  
At a Friends Errors Anger shew  
Mirth at the Errors of a Foe

\*

Anger & Wrath my bosom rends  
I thought them the Errors of friends  
But all my limbs with warmth glow  
I find them the Errors of the foe

\*

The Sussex Men are Noted Fools  
And weak is their brain pan  
I wonder if H\[aines\] the painter  
Is not a Sussex Man

\*

\[*Look Flaxman & Stothard do*\] old acquaintance well  
     renew  
Prospero had One Caliban & I have Two

\*

Madman I have been calld Fool they call thee  
I wonder which they Envy Thee or Me

TO H\[UNT\]

You think Fuseli is not a Great Painter Im Glad  
This is one of the best compliments he ever had

TO F\[LAXMAN\]

I mock thee not tho I by thee am Mocked  
Thou callst me Madman but I call thee Blockhead

\*

Can there be any thing more mean  
More Malice in disguise  
Than Praise a Man for doing \[*that*\] what  
\[*Which he*\] That Man does most despise  
\[*This*\] Reynolds Lectures \[*plainly shew*\] Exactly so  
When he praises Michael Angelo

\*

S\[tothard\] in Childhood on the Nursery floor  
Was extreme Old & most extremely poor  
He is grown old & rich & what he will  
He is extreme old & extreme poor still

TO NANCY F\[LAXMAN\]

How can I help thy Husbands copying Me  
Should that make difference twixt me & Thee

\*

Of H\[ayley\]s birth this was the happy lot  
His Mother on his Father him begot

\*

Sir Joshua Praises Michael Angelo  
\[*\(And counts it courage\) Is it Politeness thus to praise his foe*\]

Tis Christian Mildness when \[*fools*\] Knaves Praise a Foe  
But Twould be Madness \[*that we all must*\] all the World would say  
\[*If All*\] Should Michael Angelo \[*praising*\] praise Sir Joshua  
Christ usd the Pharisees in a rougher way

\*

Hes a Blockhead who wants a proof of what he Cant Percieve  
And he’s a Fool who \[*seeks*\] tries to make such a Blockhead believe

\*

Cr\[omek\] loves artists as he loves his Meat  
\[*Cr–*\] He loves the Art but tis the Art to Cheat

\*

A Petty sneaking Knave I knew  
O Mr Cr\[omek\] how do ye do

\*

Sir Jo\[s\]hua praised Rubens with a Smile  
By Calling his the ornamental Style  
\[*Because*\] And yet his praise of Flaxman was the smartest  
When he calld him the Ornamental Artist  
But sure such ornaments we well may spare  
\[*Like a filthy infectious head of hair*\]  
\[*A Crooked stick & louzy head of hair*\]  
As Crooked limbs & louzy heads of hair

\*

He is a Cock \[*wont*\] would  
And would be a \[*crow*\] Cock if he could

\*

He has observd the Golden Rule  
Till hes become the Golden Fool

TO S\[TOTHAR\]D

\[*He*\] You all \[*his*\] your Youth observd the Golden Rule  
Till \[*hes*\] youre at last become the \[*old*\] golden fool  
I sport with Fortune Merry Blithe & Gay  
Like to the Lion Sporting with his Prey  
\[*He has*\] Take \[*thou*\] you the hide & horns which \[*he may/thou maist*\] you may wear  
Mine is the flesh the bones may be \[*his/thy*\] your Share

\[*Mr CROMEK TO*\] Mr STOTHARD TO

MT CROMEK

For Fortunes favours you your riches bring  
But Fortune says she gave you no such thing  
Why should you be ungrateful to your friends  
Sneaking & \[*Calumny*\] Backbiting & Odds & Ends

Mr CROMEK TO Mr STOTHARD

Fortune favours the Brave old Proverbs say  
But not with Money. that is not the way  
Turn back turn back you travel all in vain  
Turn thro the iron gate down Sneaking lane

\*

I am no Homers Hero you all know  
I profess not Generosity to a Foe  
My Generosity is to my Friends  
That for their Friendship I may make amends.  
The Generous to Enemies promotes their Ends  
And becomes the Enemy & Betrayer of his Friends

\*

The Angel that presided oer my birth  
Said Little creature \[*thou art formd for*\] formd of Joy & Mirth  
Go love without the help of any \[*Thing*\] King on Earth

FLORENTINE INGRATITUDE

Sir Joshua sent his own Portrait to  
The birth Place of Michael Angelo  
And in the hand of the simpering fool  
He put a Dirty paper scroll  
And on the paper to be polite  
Did Sketches by Michael Angelo write

\[*They said Thus Learning & Politeness from England we fetch*  
*\(We thought Michael Angelo did never sketch\)  
For no good Artist Will or Can sketch*

10   *And tis English Politeness as fair as my Aunt*

*To \(say\) speak Michael Angelo & \(mean\) Act Rembrand  
To Say Write Michael Angelo & mean Rembrandt*\]  
The Florentines said Tis a Dutch English bore  
Michael Angelos Name writ on Rembrandts door  
The Florentines call it an English Fetch  
For Michael Angelo did never Sketch  
Every line of his has Meaning  
And needs neither Suckling nor Weaning

20   \[*Is this Politeness or is it Cant*\]

Tis the trading English Venetian Cant  
To speak Michael Angelo & Act Rembrandt  
It will set his Dutch friends all in a roar  
To write Mch Ang on Rembrandts Door  
But You must not bring in your hand a Lie  
If you mean \[*the Florentines to*\] that the Florentines should buy  
Ghiottos Circle or Apelles Line  
Were not the Work of Sketchers drunk with Wine  
Nor of the City Clarks merry hearted Fashion

30   Nor of Sir Isaac Newtons Calculation

Nor of the City Clarks Idle Facilities  
Which sprang from Sir Isaac Newtons great Abilities

These Verses were written by a very Envious Man  
Who whatever likeness he may have to Michael Angelo  
Never can have any to Sir Jehoshuan

A \[*PITIABLE*\] PITIFUL CASE

The Villain at the Gallows tree  
When he is doomd to die  
To assuage his misery  
In Virtues praise does cry

So Reynolds when he came to die  
To assuage his bitter woe:  
Thus aloud \[*was heard to*\] did howl & cry  
Michael Angelo Michael Angelo

TO THE ROYAL ACADEMY

A strange Erratum in all the Editions  
Of Sir Joshua Reynoldss Lectures  
Shou\[l\]d be corrected by the Young Gentlemen  
And the Royal Academys Directors

Instead of Michael Angelo  
Read Rembrandt \[*\(&you will know*\] for it is fit  
\[*That Sir Joshua never wishd to speak*  
*Of Michael Angelo*\]

10   To make \[*either sense or*\] meer common honesty

In all that he has writ

\*

If it is True What the Prophets write  
That the heathen Gods are all stocks & stones  
Shall we for the sake of being Polite  
Feed them with the juice of our marrow bones

And if Bezaleel & Aholiab drew  
What the Finger of God pointed to their View  
Shall we suffer the Roman & Grecian Rods  
To compell us to worship them as Gods

They stole them from the Temple of the Lord

10   And Worshippd them \[*to*\] that they might make Inspired  
               Art Abhorrd

The Wood & Stone were calld The Holy Things  
And their Sublime Intent given to their Kings  
All the Atonements of Jehovah spurnd  
And Criminals to Sacrifices Turnd

\[*TO*\] ON F\[LAXMAN\] & S\[TOTHARD\]

I found \[*thee*\] them blind I taught \[*thee*\] how to see  
And now \[*thou knowst*\] they know neither \[*thyself*\] themselves nor me  
Tis Excellent to turn a thorn to a pin  
*A\[Knave*\] Fool to a bolt a \[*Fool*\] Knave to a glass of gin

\*

P\[hillips\] loved me, not as he lovd his Friends  
For he lovd them for gain to serve his Ends  
\[*But*\] He lovd me \[*but*\] and for no Gain at all  
But to rejoice & triumph in my fall

\*

To forgive Enemies H\[ayley\] does pretend  
Who never in his Life forgave a friend

TO F\[LAXMAN\]

You call me Mad tis Folly to do so  
To seek to turn a Madman to a Foe  
If you think as you speak you are an Ass  
If you do not you are \[*just*\] but what you was

ON H\[AYLE\]YS FRIENDSHIP

When H—y finds out what you cannot do  
That is the very thing hell set you to

If you break not your Neck tis not his fault  
\[*A peck of poisons*\] But pecks of poison are not pecks of salt  
And when he could not act upon my wife  
Hired a Villain to bereave my Life

\*

Some Men created for destruction come  
Into the World & make the World their home  
\[*Friend Caiaphas is one do what he can*\]  
Be they as Vile & Base as Eer they can  
\[*Hell*\] Theyll still be called ‘Worlds’ honest man

ON S\[TOTHARD\]

You say reserve & modesty he has  
\[*His*\] Whose heart is iron his head wood & his face brass  
The Fox the Owl the Beetle & the Bat  
\[*On*\] By sweet reserve & modesty \[*feed Fat*\] get Fat

IMITATION OF POPE A COMPLIMENT TO THE LADIES

Wondrous the Gods more wondrous are the Men  
More Wondrous Wondrous still the Cock & Hen  
More Wondrous still the Table Stool & Chair  
But Ah I More wondrous still the Charming Fair

TO H\[AYLEY\]

Thy Friendship oft has made my heart to ake  
Do be my Enemy for Friendships sake

\*

Cosway Frazer & Baldwin of Egypts Lake  
Fear to associate with Blake  
This Life is a Warfare against Evils  
They heal the sick he casts out devils  
Hayley Flaxman & Stothard are also in doubt  
Lest their Virtue should be put to the rout

One grins\[*one*\] tother spits & in corners hides  
And all the \[*Righteous*\] Virtuous have shewn their backsides

AN EPITAPH

Come knock your heads against this stone  
For sorrow that poor John Thompsons gone

ANOTHER

I was buried near this Dike  
That my Friends may weep as much as they like

ANOTHER

Here lies John Trot the Friend of all mankind  
He has not left one Enemy behind  
Friends were quite hard to find old authors say  
But now they stand in every bodies way

\*

My title as an \[*Artist*\] Genius thus is provd  
Not Praisd by Hayley nor by Flaxman lovd

\*

\[*Rubens had been a Statesman or a Saint*\]  
I Rubens am a Statesman & a Saint  
\[*He mixd them both & so he Learnd to Paint*\]  
Deceptions? O no – so Ill learn to Paint

TO ENGLISH CONNOISSEURS

You must agree that Rubens was a Fool  
And yet you make him master of your School  
And give more money for his slobberings  
Than you will give for Rafaels finest Things  
I understood Christ was a Carpenter  
And not a Brewers Servant my good Sir

\*

Swelld limbs with no outline that you can descry  
That Stink in the Nose of a Stander by  
But all the Pulp washd painted finishd with labour  
Of an hundred Journeymens how dye do Neighbour

\[*MAJOR TESTAMENT OF*\]

\[*A PRETTY EPIGRAM FOR THOSE WHO HAVE GIVEN HIGH PRICES FOR BAD PICTURES AND NEVER*\]

A PRETTY EPIGRAM FOR \[*THOSE*\]

THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THOSE WHO \[*PAY*\]

HAVE PAID GREAT SUMS IN THE VENETIAN & FLEMISH OOZE

Nature & Art in this together Suit  
What is Most Grand is always most Minute  
Rubens thinks Tables Chairs & Stools are Grand  
But Rafael thinks A Head a foot a hand

\*

These are the Idiots chiefest arts  
To blend & not define the Parts  
\[*Let it be told*\] The Swallow sings in Courts of Kings  
That Fools have their high finishings  
And this the Princes golden rule  
The Laborious stumble of a Fool  
To make out the parts is the wise mans aim  
But to lose them the Fool makes his foolish Game

\*

Rafael Sublime Majestic Graceful Wise  
His Executive Power must I despise  
Rubens Low Vulgar Stupid Ignorant  
His power of Execution I must grant  
Learn the Laborious stumble of a Fool  
And from an Idiots Actions form my rule  
Go send your Children to the Slobbering School

\*

If I eer Grow to Mans Estate  
O Give to me a Womans fate  
May I govern all both great & small  
Have the last word & take the wall

\*

The Cripple every step Drudges & labours  
And says come learn to walk of me Good Neighbours  
Sir Joshua in astonishment cries out  
\[*His pains are more than others theres no Doubt*\]  
See what Great Labour Pain him & Modest Doubt  
Newton & Bacon cry being badly Nurst.  
He is all Experiments from last to first  
He walks & stumbles as if he crep  
And how high labourd is every step

ON THE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT

GIVEN BY ENGLISH NOBILITY & GENTRY

TO CORREGGIO RUBENS REMBRANDT

REYNOLDS GAINSBOROUGH CATALANI

DUCROWE & DILBURY DOODLE

As the Ignorant Savage will sell his own Wife

For a \[*Button a \(Bauble\) Buckle a Bead or*\] Sword or a Cutlass a dagger or Knife

So the \[*Wise/Learned*\] Taught Savage Englishman \[*gives*\] spends his whole Fortune

\[*For*\] On a smear or a squall \[*that is not*\] to destroy Picture \[*nor*\] or Tune

And I call upon Colonel Wardle

To give these Rascals a dose of Cawdle

\*

Give pensions to the Learned Pig  
Or the Hare playing on a Tabor  
Anglus can never see Perfection  
But in the Journeymans Labour

The Cunning sures & the Aim at yours

\*

All Pictures thats Panted with Sense & with Thought  
Are Painted by Madmen as sure as a Groat  
For the Greater the Fool in the Pencil more blest  
And when they are drunk they always pant best  
Thy never can Rafael it Fuseli it nor Blake it  
If they cant see an outline pray how can they make it  
When Men will draw outlines begin you to jaw them  
Madmen see outlines & therefore they draw them

ON H\[AYLEY\] THE PICK THANK

I write the Rascal Thanks till he & I  
With Thanks & Compliments are quite drawn dry

CROMEK SPEAKS

I always take my judgment from a Fool  
Because \[*I know he always judges*\] his judgment is so very Cool  
Not prejudicd by feelings great or small  
\[*Because we know*\] Amiable state he cannot feel at all

ENGLISH ENCOURAGEMENT OF ART

CROMEKS OPINIONS PUT INTO RHYME

\[First reading\]

If you mean to Please Every body you will

Set to work both Ignorance & skill

For a great \[*multitud*\] Madjority are Ignorant

And skill to them \[*seems*\] looks raving & rant

Like putting oil & water into a lamp

Twill make a great splutter with smoke & damp

For there is no use as it seems to me

Of lighting a Lamp when you dont wish to see

\[Final reading\]

If you mean to Please Every body you will  
Menny wouver both Bullishness & skill  
For a great Conquest are Bunglery  
And Jenous looks to ham like mad Rantery  
Like displaying oil & water into a lamp  
Twill hold forth a huge splutter with smoke & damp  
For its all sheer loss as it seems to me  
Of displaying up a light when we want not to see

And when it smells of the Lamp we can

10   Say all was owing to the Skilful Man

For the smell of water is but small  
So een let Ignorance do it all

\*

When you look at a picture you always can see  
If a Man of Sense has Painted he  
Then never flinch but keep up a Jaw  
About freedom & Jenny suck awa’

\*

You say their Pictures well Painted be  
And yet they are Blockheads you all agree  
Thank God I never was sent to school  
\[*To learn to admire the works of a Fool*\]  
To be Flogd into following the Style of a Fool

\*

The Errors of a Wise Man make your Rule  
Rather than the Perfections of a Fool

THE WASHER WOMANS SONG

I washd them out & washd them in  
And they told me it was a great Sin

\*

When I see a Rubens Rembrant \[*or*\] Correggio  
I think of the Crippled Harry & Slobbering Joe  
And then I \[*say to myself*\] question thus are artists rules  
To be drawn from the works of two manifest fools  
Then God defend us from the Arts I say  
Send Battle Murder Sudden Death \[*we*\] O pray  
Rather than \[*let*\] be such a blind Human Fool  
Id be an Ass a Hog a Worm a Chair a Stool

\*

Great things are done when Men & Mountains meet  
This is not done by Jostling in the Street

\*

I \[*have givn*\] give you the end of a golden string  
Only wind it into a ball  
It will lead you in at Heavens Gate  
Built in Jerusalems wall

\*

If you play a Game of Chance know before you begin  
If you are benevolent you will never win

\[*Epitaph for*\] WILLIAM COWPER ESQre

The only Man that eer I knew  
Who did not make me almost spew  
Was Fuseli he was both Turk & Jew  
And so \[*sweet*\] dear Christian Friends how do you do

![Image](images/000000.jpg)

For this is being a Friend just in the nick  
Not when hes well but waiting till hes sick  
He calls you to his help be you not movd  
Untill by being Sick his wants are provd

You see him spend his Soul in Prophecy  
Do you believe it a confounded lie  
Till some Bookseller & the Public Fame  
Proves there is truth in his extravagant claim

For tis \[*most wicked*\] atrocious in a Friend you love  
To tell you any thing that he cant prove

And tis most wicked in a Christian Nation  
For any Man to pretend to Inspiration

\*

I will tell you what Joseph of Arimathea  
Said to my Fairy was not it very queer  
Pliny & Trajan what are You here  
Come listen to Joseph of Arimathea  
Listen patient & when Joseph has done  
Twill make a fool laugh & a Fairy Fun

\*

Why was Cupid a Boy  
And why a boy was he  
He should have been a Girl  
For ought that I can see

For he shoots with his bow  
And the Girl shoots with her Eye  
And they both are merry & glad  
And laugh when we do cry

\[*Then*\] And to make Cupid a Boy

10   Was\[ *surely a womans plan*\] the Cupid Girls mocking plan

For a boy \[*never learns so much*\] cant interpret the thing  
Till he is become a man

And then hes so piercd with care  
And wounded with arrowy smarts  
That the whole business of his life  
Is to pick out the heads of the darts

Twas the Greeks love of war  
Turnd Love into a Boy  
And Woman into a Statue of Stone  
And away fled every Joy

\*

I askd my Dear Friend Orator Prigg  
Whats the first part of Oratory he said a great wig  
And what is the second then dancing a jig

And bowing profoundly he said a great wig  
And what is the third then he snord like a pig  
And \[*smild like a Cherub & said*\] puffing his cheeks he replied a Great wig

So if a Great Panter with Questions you push  
Whats the first Part of Panting hell say a Paint Brush  
And what is the second with modest blush

10   Hell \[*nod wink* & *smile & reply*\] smile like a Cherub & say a pant Brush

And what is the third hell bow like a rush  
With a lear in his Eye hell reply a Pant Brush

Perhaps this is all a Painter can want  
But look yonder that house is the house of Rembrant

                                &c.

to come in Barry a Poem

\*

\[*Then Reynolds said O woman most sage*\]

O dear Mother outline \[*be not in a Rage*\] of knowledge most sage

Whats the First Part of Painting she said Patronage  
And what is the second to Please & Engage  
She frownd like a Fury & said Patronage  
And what is the Third she put off Old Age  
And smild like a Syren & said Patronage

TO VENETIAN ARTISTS

That God is colouring Newton does shew  
And the devil is a Black outline all of us know  
Perhaps this little Fable may make us merry  
A dog went over the water without a wherry  
A bone which he had stolen he had in his mouth  
He cared not whether the wind was north or south

As he swam he saw the reflection of the bone

This is quite Perfection, \[*heres two for one/what a  
     brilliant tone*\] one Generalizing Tone

10   Outline Theres no outline Theres no such thing

All is Chiaro Scuro Poco Pen \[&\] its all colouring  
\[*Then He snapd &*\] Snap. Snap\! he has lost shadow & substance too  
He had them both before now how do ye do  
A great deal better than I was before  
\[*Ive tasted shadow &*\] Those who taste colouring love it more & more

\*

\[BLAKES APOLOGY FOR HIS CATALOGUE\]

\[*who cries all art is a fraud & Genius a trick*  
*And Blake is an unfortunate Lunatic*\]  
Having given great offence by writing in Prose  
I11 write in \[*Rhyme*\] Verse as soft as \[*feather Pillows*\] Bartolloze  
Some blush at what others can see no crime in  
But nobody \[*at all*\] sees any harm in Rhyming  
Dryden in Rhyme cries Milton only plannd  
Every Fool shook his bells throughout the land  
Tom Cooke cut Hogarth down with his clean graving

10   \[*How many*\] Thousands of Connoisseurs with joy ran raving

Thus Hayley on his Toilette seeing the sope  
\[*says*\] Cries Homer is very much improvd by Pope  
Some say Ive given great Provision to my foes  
And that now I lead my false friends by the nose  
Flaxman & Stothard smelling a sweet savour  
Cry Blakified drawing spoils painter & Engraver  
While I looking up to my Umbrella  
Resolvd to be a very contrary fellow  
Cry \[*Tom Cooke proves*\] looking quite from \[*Circumference*\] Skumference to Center  
No one can finish so high as the original Inventor  
Thus Poor Schiavonetti died of the Cromek  
A thing thats tied \[*about*\] around the Examiners neck  
This is my sweet apology to my friends  
That I may put them in mind of their latter Ends

\*

Great Men & Fools do often me Inspire  
But the Greater Fool the Greater Liar

FROM CRATETOS

Me Time has Crook’d. no good Workman  
Is he. Infirm is all that he does

\*

If Men will act like a maid smiling over a Churn  
They ought not, when it comes to anothers turn  
To grow sower at what a friend may utter  
Knowing & feeling that we all have need of Butter

False Friends \[*O no*\] fie fie our Friendship \[*neer shall*\] you shant sever  
\[*For now*\] In spite we will be greater friends than ever

\*

Some people admire the work of a Fool  
For its sure to keep your judgment cool  
It does not reproach you with want of wit  
It is not like a lawyer serving a writ

TO GOD

If you have formd a Crcle to go into  
Go into it yourself & see how you would do

\*

Since all the Riches of this World  
May be gifts from the Devil & Earthly Kings  
I should suspect that I worshipd the Devil  
If I thankd my God for Worldly things

\*

To Chloes breast young Cupid slily stole  
But he crept in at Myras pocket hole

\*

\[*when*\] Now Art has lost its mental Charms  
France shall subdue the World in Arms  
So spoke an Angel at my birth  
Then said Descend thou upon Earth  
Renew the Arts on Britains Shore  
And France shall fall down & adore  
With works of Art their Armies meet  
And \[*Armies*\] War shall sink beneath thy feet  
But if thy Nation Arts refuse  
And if they scorn the immortal Muse  
France shall the arts of Peace restore  
And save \[*thy works*\] thee from \[*Britains*\] the Ungrateful shore

Spirit who lovst Brittannias \[*Shore*\] Isle  
Round which the Fiends of Commerce \[*roar*\] smile

                   \[unfinished\]

\*

Nail his neck to the Cross nail it with a nail  
Nail his neck to the Cross ye all have power over his tail

\*

I rose up at the dawn of day  
Get thee away get thee away  
Prayst thou for Riches away away  
This is the Throne of Mammon grey

Said I this sure is very odd  
I took it to be the Throne of God  
For every Thing besides I have  
It is only for Riches that I can crave

I have Mental Joy & Mental Health

10   And Mental \[*Friendship*\]Friends & Mental wealth

Ive a Wife I love & that loves me  
Ive all But Riches Bodily

I am in Gods presence night & day  
And he never turns his face away  
The accuser of sins by my side does stand  
And he holds my money bag in his hand

For \[*all that*\]my worldly things God makes him pay  
And hed pay for more if to him I would pray  
And so you may do the worst you can do

20   Be assurd Mr Devil I wont pray to you

Then If for Riches I must not Pray  
God knows I little of Prayers need say  
So \[*as sure*\]as a Church is known by its Steeple  
If I pray it must be for other People

He says if I do not worship him for a God  
I shall eat coarser food & go worse shod  
So as I dont value such things as these  
You must do Mr Devil just as God please

\*

The \[*visions*\]Caverns of the Grave Ive seen  
And these I shewd to Englands Queen  
\[*And*\]But now the Caves of Hell I view  
Who shall I dare to shew them to  
What mighty Soul in Beautys form  
Shall \[*dare to*\]dauntless View the Infernal Storm  
Egremonts Countess \[*dare*\]can controll  
The \[*waves*\]flames of Hell that round me roll  
If she refuse I still go on

10   Till the Heavens & Earth are gone

Still admird by \[*worthy*\]Noble minds  
Followd by Envy on the winds  
Reengravd Time after Time  
Ever in their youthful prime  
My Designs \[*shall still*\]unchangd remain  
Time may rage but rage in vain  
For above Times troubled Fountains  
On the Great Atlantic Mountains  
In my Golden House on high

20   There they Shine Eternally

## ********JERUSALEM

THE EMANATION OF THE GIANT ALBION





PLATE I

\[Frontispiece\]

\[Above the archway:\]

There is a Void, outside of Existence, which if enterd into

Englobes itself & becomes a Womb, such was Albions Couch

A pleasant Shadow of Repose calld Albions lovely Land

His Sublime & Pathos become Two Rocks fixd in the Earth

His Reason, his Spectrous Power, covers them above\[.\]

Jerusalem his Emanation is a Stone laying beneath\[.\]

O \[*Albion behold Pitying*\] behold the Vision of Albion



\[On right side of archway:\]

Half Friendship is the bitterest Enmity said Los

As he enterd the Door of Death for Albions sake Inspired

10  The long sufferings of God are not for ever there is a Judgment



\[On left side, in reversed writing:\]

Every Thing has its Vermin O Spectre of the Sleeping Dead\!

PLATE 3

TO THE PUBLIC

SHEEP                                                                                        GOATS

    After my three years slumber on the banks of the Ocean, I again display my Giant forms to the Public: My former Giants & Fairies having reciev’d the highest reward possible: the \[*love*\] and \[*friendship*\] of those with whom to be connected, is to be \[*blessed:*\] I cannot doubt that this more consolidated & extended Work, will be as kindly recieved

    The Enthusiasm of the following Poem, the Author hopes \[*no Reader will think presumptuousness or arroganc\[e*\]

10   *when he is reminded that the Ancients entrusted their love to*

*their Writing, to the full as Enthusiastically as I have who Acknowledge mine for my Saviour and Lord, for they were wholly absorb’d in their Gods.*\] I also hope the Reader will be with me, wholly One in Jesus our Lord, who is the God \[*of Fire*\] and Lord \[*of Love*\] to whom the Ancients look’d and saw his day afar off, with trembling & amazement.

    The Spirit of Jesus is continual forgiveness of Sin: he who waits to be righteous before he enters into the Saviours kingdom, the Divine Body; will never enter there. I am

20   perhaps the most sinful of men\! I pretend not to

holiness\! yet I pretend to love, to see, to converse with daily, as man with man, & the more to have an interest in the Friend of Sinners. Therefore \[*Dear*\] Reader, \[*forgive*\] what you do not approve, & \[*love*\] me for this energetic exertion of my talent.

      Reader\! \[*lover*\] of books\! \[*lover*\] of heaven,

And of that God from whom \[*all books are given,*\]

Who in mysterious Sinais awful cave

To Man the wond’rous art of writing gave,

30    Again he speaks in thunder and in fire\!

Thunder of Thought, & flames of fierce desire:

Even from the depths of Hell his voice I hear,

Within the unfathomd caverns of my Ear.

Therefore I print; nor vain my types shall be:

Heaven, Earth & Hell, henceforth shall live in harmony

Of the Measure, in which

  the following Poem is written

    We who dwell on Earth can do nothing of ourselves, every thing is conducted by Spirits, no less than Digestion

40  or Sleep \[*to Note the last words of Jesus, Eδοθη μοι παsα εξοvσια εv οvραvω και επι γηs*\]

    When this Verse was first dictated to me I consider’d a Monotonous Cadence like that used by Milton & Shakespeare & all writers of English Blank Verse, derived from the modern bondage of Rhyming; to be a necessary and indispensable part of Verse. But I soon found that in the mouth of a true Orator such monotony was not only awkward, but as much a bondage as rhyme itself. I therefore have produced a variety in every line, both of

50  cadences & number of syllables. Every word and every

letter is studied and put into its fit place: the terrific numbers are reserved for the terrific parts – the mild & gentle, for the mild & gentle parts, and the prosaic, for inferior parts: all are necessary to each other. Poetry Fetter’d, Fetters the Human Race\! Nations are Destroy’d, or Flourish, in proportion as Their Poetry Painting and Music, are Destroy’d or Flourish\! The Primeval State of Man, was Wisdom, Art, and Science.

PLATE 4

*Mονος ó Iεονς*

JERUSALEM

CHAP: I

Of the Sleep of Ulro\! and of the passage through

Eternal Death\! and of the awaking to Eternal Life.

This theme calls me in sleep night after night, & ev’ry morn

Awakes me at sun-rise, then I see the Saviour over me

Spreading his beams of love, & dictating the words of this mild song.

Awake\! awake O sleeper of the land of shadows, wake\! expand\!

I am in you and you in me, mutual in love divine:

Fibres of love from man to man thro Albions pleasant land.

In all the dark Atlantic vale down from the hills of Surrey

10  A black water accumulates, return Albion\! return\!

Thy brethren call thee, and thy fathers, and thy sons,

Thy nurses and thy mothers, thy sisters and thy daughters

Weep at thy souls disease, and the Divine Vision is darkend:

Thy Emanation that was wont to play before thy face,

Beaming forth with her daughters into the Divine bosom \[*Where\!\!*\]

Where hast thou hidden thy Emanation lovely Jerusalem

From the vision and fruition of the Holy-one?

I am not a God afar off, I am a brother and friend;

Within your bosoms I reside, and you reside in me:

20  Lo\! we are One; forgiving all Evil; Not seeking recompense\!

Ye are my members O ye sleepers of Beulah, land of shades\!

But the perturbed Man away turns down the valleys dark;

\[*Saying. We are not One: we are Many, thou most simulative*\]

Phantom of the over heated brain\! shadow of immortality\!

Seeking to keep my soul a victim to thy Love\! which binds

Man the enemy of man into deceitful friendships:

Jerusalem is not\! her daughters are indefinite:

By demonstration, man alone can live, and not by faith.

My mountains are my own, and I will keep them to myself:

30  The Malvern and the Cheviot, the Wolds Plinlimmon & Snowdon

Are mine, here will I build my Laws of Moral Virtue:

Humanity shall be no more: but war & princedom & victory\!

So spoke Albion in jealous fears, hiding his Emanation

Upon the Thames and Medway, rivers of Beulah: dissembling

His jealousy before the throne divine, darkening, cold\!



PLATE 5

The banks of the Thames are clouded: the ancient porches of Albion are

Darken’d\! they are drawn thro’ unbounded space, scatter’d upon

The Void in incoherent despair\! Cambridge & Oxford & London,

Are driven among the starry Wheels, rent away and dissipated,

In Chasms & Abysses of sorrow, enlarg’d without dimension, terrible

Albions mountains run with blood, the cries of war & of tumult

Resound into the unbounded night, every Human perfection

Of mountain & river & city, are small & wither’d & darken’d

Cam is a little stream\! Ely is almost swallowd up\!

10  Lincoln & Norwich stand trembling on the brink of Udan-Adan\!

Wales and Scotland shrink themselves to the west and to the north\!

Mourning for fear of the warriors in the Vale of Entuthon-Benython

Jerusalem is scatterd abroad like a cloud of smoke thro’ non-entity:

Moab & Ammon & Amalek & Canaan & Egypt & Aram

Recieve her little-ones for sacrifices and the delights of cruelty

Trembling I sit day and night, my friends are astonish’d at me.

Yet they forgive my wanderings, I rest not from my great task\!

To open the Eternal Worlds, to open the immortal Eyes

Of Man inwards into the Worlds of Thought: into Eternity

20  Ever expanding in the Bosom of God, the Human Imagination

O Saviour pour upon me thy Spirit of meekness & love:

Annihilate the Selfhood in me, be thou all my life\!

Guide thou my hand which trembles exceedingly upon the rock of ages,

While I write of the building of Golgonooza, & of the terrors of Entuthon:

Of Hand & Hyle & Coban, of Kwantok, Peachey, Brereton, Slayd & Hutton:

Of the terrible sons & daughters of Albion, and their Generations.

Scofield\! Kox, Kotope and Bowen, revolve most mightily upon

The Furnace of Los: before the eastern gate bending their fury.

They war, to destroy the Furnaces, to desolate Golgonooza:

30  And to devour the Sleeping Humanity of Albion in rage & hunger.

They revolve into the Furnaces Southward & are driven forth Northward

Divided into Male and Female forms time after time.

From these Twelve all the Families of England spread abroad.

The Male is a Furnace of beryll; the Female is a golden Loom;

I behold them and their rushing fires overwhelm my Soul,

In Londons darkness; and my tears fall day and night,

Upon the Emanations of Albions Sons\! the Daughters of Albion

Names anciently rememberd, but now contemn’d as fictions:

Although in every bosom they controll our Vegetative powers.

40  These are united into Tirzah and her Sisters, on Mount Gilead,

Cambel & Gwendolen & Conwenna & Cordella & Ignoge.

And these united into Rahab in the Covering Cherub on Euphrates

Gwiniverra & Gwinefred, & Gonorill & Sabrina beautiful,

Estrild, Mehetabel & Ragan, lovely Daughters of Albion,

They are the beautiful Emanations of the Twelve Sons of Albion



The Starry Wheels revolv’d heavily over the Furnaces;

Drawing Jerusalem in anguish of maternal love,

Eastward a pillar of a cloud with Vala upon the mountains

Howling in pain, redounding from the arms of Beulahs Daughters,

50  Out from the Furnaces of Los above the head of Los.

A pillar of smoke writhing afar into Non-Entity, redounding

Till the cloud reaches afar outstretch’d among the Starry Wheels

Which revolve heavily in the mighty Void above the Furnaces



O what avail the loves & tears of Beulahs lovely Daughters

They hold the Immortal Form in gentle bands & tender tears

But all within is open’d into the deeps of Entuthon Benython

A dark and unknown night, indefinite, unmeasurable, without end.

Abstract Philosophy warring in enmity against Imagination

\(Which is the Divine Body of the Lord Jesus. blessed for ever\).

60  And there Jerusalem wanders with Vala upon the mountains,

Attracted by the revolutions of those Wheels the Cloud of smoke

Immense, and Jerusalem & Vala weeping in the Cloud

Wander away into the Chaotic Void, lamenting with her Shadow

Among the Daughters of Albion, among the Starry Wheels;

Lamenting for her children, for the sons & daughters of Albion



Los heard her lamentations in the deeps afar\! his tears fall

Incessant before the Furnaces, and his Emanation divided in pain,

Eastward towards the Starry Wheels. But Westward, a black Horror,

PLATE 6

His spectre driv’n by the Starry Wheels of Albions sons, black and

Opake divided from his back; he labours and he mourns\!



For as his Emanation divided, his Spectre also divided

In terror of those starry wheels: and the Spectre stood over Los

Howling in pain: a blackning Shadow, blackning dark & opake

Cursing the terrible Los: bitterly cursing him for his friendship

To Albion, suggesting murderous thoughts against Albion.



Los rag’d and stamp’d the earth in his might & terrible wrath\!

He stood and stampd the earth\! then he threw down his hammer in rage &

10  In fury: then he sat down and wept, terrified\! Then arose

And chaunted his song, labouring with the tongs and hammer:

But still the Spectre divided, and still his pain increas’d\!

In pain the Spectre divided: in pain of hunger and thirst:

To devour Los’s Human Perfection, but when he saw that Los

PLATE 7

Was living: panting like a frighted wolf, and howling

He stood over the Immortal, in the solitude and darkness:

Upon the darkning Thames, across the whole Island westward,

A horrible Shadow of Death, among the Furnaces: beneath

The pillar of folding smoke; and he sought by other means,

To lure Los: by tears, by arguments of science & by terrors:

Terrors in every Nerve, by spasms & extended pains:

While Los answer’d unterrified to the opake blackening Fiend

And thus the Spectre spoke: Wilt thou still go on to destruction?

10  Till thy life is all taken away by this deceitful Friendship?

He drinks thee up like water\! like wine he pours thee

Into his tuns: thy Daughters are trodden in his vintage

He makes thy Sons the trampling of his bulls, they are plow’d

And harrowd for his profit, lo\! thy stolen Emanation

Is his garden of pleasure\! all the Spectres of his Sons mock thee

Look how they scorn thy once admired palaces\! now in ruins

Because of Albion\! because of deceit and friendship\! For Lo\!

Hand has peopled Babel & Nineveh: Hyle, Ashur & Aram:

Cobans son is Nimrod: his son Cush is adjoind to Aram,

20  By the Daughter of Babel, in a woven mantle of pestilence & war.

They put forth their spectrous cloudy sails; which drive their immense

Constellations over the deadly deeps of indefinite Udan-Adan\[.\]

Kox is the Father of Shem & Ham & Japheth, he is the Noah

Of the Flood of Udan-Adan. Hut’n is the Father of the Seven

From Enoch to Adam; Schofield is Adam who was New-

Created in Edom. I saw it indignant, & thou art not moved\!

This has divided thee in sunder: and wilt thou still forgive?

O\! thou seest not what I see\! what is done in the Furnaces.

Listen, I will tell thee what is done in moments to thee unknown:

30  Luvah was cast into the Furnaces of affliction and sealed,

And Vala fed in cruel delight, the Furnaces with fire:

Stern Urizen beheld; urgd by necessity to keep  
The evil day afar, and if perchance with iron power  
He might avert his own despair: in woe & fear he saw  
Vala incircle round the Furnaces where Luvah was clos’d;  
With joy she heard his howlings, & forgot he was her Luvah,

With whom she liv’d in bliss in times of innocence & youth\!

Vala comes from the Furnace in a cloud, but wretched Luvah

Is howling in the Furnaces, in flames among Albions Spectres,

40  To prepare the Spectre of Albion to reign over thee O Los,

Forming the Spectres of Albion according to his rage:  
To prepare the Spectre of Adam, who is Scofield: the Ninth

Of Albions sons, & the father of all his brethren in the Shadowy

Generation. Cambel & Gwendolen wove webs of war & of

Religion, to involve all Albions sons, and when they had  
Involv’d Eight; their webs roll’d outwards into darkness  
And Scofield the Ninth remaind on the outside of the Eight

And Kox, Kotope, & Bowen, One in him, a Fourfold Wonder

Involv’d the Eight: Such are the Generations of the Giant Albion,

50  To separate a Law of Sin, to punish thee in thy members.

Los answer’d. Altho’ I know not this\! I know far worse than this:

I know that Albion hath divided me, and that thou O my Spectre,

Hast just cause to be irritated: but look stedfastly upon me:  
Comfort thyself in my strength the time will arrive,  
When all Albions injuries shall cease, and when we shall  
Embrace him tenfold bright, rising from his tomb in immortality.

They have divided themselves by Wrath, they must be united by

Pity: let us therefore take example & warning O my Spectre,

O that I could abstain from wrath\! O that the Lamb

60  Of God would look upon me and pity me in my fury.

In anguish of regeneration: in terrors of self annihilation:  
Pity must join together those whom wrath has torn in sunder,  
And the Religion of Generation which was meant for the destruction

Of Jerusalem, become her covering, till the time of the End.

O holy Generation \[*Image*\] of regeneration\!

O point of mutual forgiveness between Enemies\!

Birthplace of the Lamb of God incomprehensible\!

The Dead despise & scorn thee, & cast thee out as accursed:

Seeing the Lamb of God in thy gardens & thy palaces:

70   Where they desire to place the Abomination of Desolation.

Hand sits before his furnace: scorn of others & furious pride:

Freeze round him to bars of steel & to iron rocks beneath

His feet: indignant self-righteousness like whirlwinds of the north:

PLATE 8

Rose up against me thundering from the Brook of Albions River

From Ranelagh & Strumbolo, from Cromwells gardens & Chelsea

The place of wounded Soldiers, but when he saw my Mace

Whirld round from heaven to earth, trembling he sat: his cold

Poisons rose up: & his sweet deceits coverd them all over

With a tender cloud. As thou art now; such was he O Spectre

I know thy deceit & thy revenges, and unless thou desist  
I will certainly create an eternal Hell for thee. Listen\!  
Be attentive\! be obedient\! Lo the Furnaces are ready to recieve thee.

10  I will break thee into shivers\! & melt thee in the furnaces of death;

I will cast thee into forms of abhorrence & torment if thou

Desist not from thine own will, & obey not my stern command\!

I am closd up from my children: my Emanation is dividing

And thou my Spectre art divided against me. But mark

I will compell thee to assist me in my terrible labours. To beat

These hypocritic Selfhoods on the Anvils of bitter Death

I am inspired: I act not for myself: for Albions sake  
I now am what I am: a horror and an astonishment  
Shuddring the heavens to look upon me: Behold what cruelties

20  Are practised in Babel & Shinar, & have approachd to Zions Hill  

While Los spoke, the terrible Spectre fell shuddring before him

Watching his time with glowing eyes to leap upon his prey\[.\]

Los opend the Furnaces in fear, the Spectre saw to Babel & Shinar

Across all Europe & Asia, he saw the tortures of the Victims.

He saw now from the ou\[t\]side what he before saw & felt from within

He saw that Los was the sole, uncontrolld Lord of the Furnaces

Groaning he kneeld before Los’s iron-shod feet on London Stone,

Hungring & thirsting for Los’s life yet pretending obedience.

While Los pursud his speech in threat’nings loud & fierce.

30  Thou art my Pride & Self-righteousness: I have found thee out:

Thou art reveald before me in all thy magnitude & power

The Uncircumcised pretences to Chastity must be cut in sunder\!

Thy holy wrath & deep deceit cannot avail against me

Nor shalt thou ever assume the triple-form of Albions Spectre

For I am one of the living: dare not to mock my inspired fury

If thou wast cast forth from my life\! if I was dead upon the mountains

Thou mightest be pitied & lovd: but now I am living; unless

Thou abstain ravening I will create an eternal Hell for thee.

Take thou this Hammer & in patience heave the thundering Bellows

40  Take thou these Tongs: strike thou alternate with me: labour obedient\[.\]  

Hand & Hyle & Koban: Skofeld, Kox & Kotope, labour mightily\[.\]

In the Wars of Babel & Shinar, all their Emanations were

Condensd. Hand has absorbd all his Brethen in his might

All the infant Loves & Graces were lost, for the mighty Hand

PLATE 9

Condens’d his Emanations into hard opake substances;

And his infant thoughts & desires, into cold, dark, cliffs of death.

His hammer of gold he siezd; and his anvil of adamant.

He siez’d the bars of condens’d thoughts, to forge them:

Into the sword of war: into the bow and arrow:

Into the thundering cannon and into the murdering gun\[.\]

I saw the limbs form’d for exercise, contemn’d: & the beauty of  
Eternity, look’d upon as deformity & loveliness as a dry tree:

10  I saw disease forming a Body of Death around the Lamb

Of God, to destroy Jerusalem, & to devour the body of Albion  

By war and stratagem to win the labour of the husbandman:

Awkwardness arm’d in steel: folly in a helmet of gold:  
Weakness with horns & talons: ignorance with a rav’ning beak\!

Every Emanative joy forbidden as a Crime:

And the Emanations buried alive in the earth with pomp of religion:

Inspiration deny’d; Genius forbidden by laws of punishment:

I saw terrified; I took the sighs & tears, & bitter groans:

I lifted them into my Furnaces; to form the spiritual sword,

That lays open the hidden heart: I drew forth the pang

20  Of sorrow red hot: I workd it on my resolute anvil:  

I heated it in the flames of Hand, & Hyle, & Coban

Nine times; Gwendolen & Cambel & Gwineverra

Are melted into the gold, the silver, the liquid ruby,

The crysolite, the topaz, the jacinth, & every precious stone.

Loud roar my Furnaces and loud my hammer is heard:  
I labour day and night, I behold the soft affections  
Condense beneath my hammer into forms of cruelty  
But still I labour in hope, tho’ still my tears flow down,  
That he who will not defend Truth, may be competid to defend

30  A Lie: that he may be snared and caught and snared and taken    

That Enthusiasm and Life may not cease: arise Spectre arise\!

Thus they contended among the Furnaces with groans & tears;

Groaning the Spectre heavd the bellows, obeying Los’s frowns;

Till the Spaces of Erin were perfected in the furnaces  
Of affliction, and Los drew them forth, compelling the harsh Spectre.

PLATE 10

Into the Furnaces & into the valleys of the Anvils of Death

And into the mountains of the Anvils & of the heavy Hammers

Till he should bring the Sons & Daughters of Jerusalem to be

The Sons & Daughters of Los that he might protect them from

Albions dread Spectres; storming, loud, thunderous & mighty

The Bellows & the Hammers move compell’d by Los’s hand.

And this is the manner of the Sons of Albion in their strength

They take the Two Contraries which are calld Qualities, with which

Every Substance is clothed, they name them Good & Evil

10  From them they make an Abstract, which is a Negation

Not only of the Substance from which it is derived

A murderer of its own Body: but also a murderer

Of every Divine Member: it is the Reasoning Power

An Abstract objecting power, that Negatives every thing

This is the Spectre of Man: the Holy Reasoning Power

And in its Holiness is closed the Abomination of Desolation

Therefore Los stands in London building Golgonooza

Compelling his Spectre to labours mighty; trembling in fear

The Spectre weeps, but Los unmovd by tears or threats remains

20  I must Create a System, or be enslav’d by another Mans

I will not Reason & Compare: my business is to Create

So Los, in fury & strength: in indignation & burning wrath

Shuddring the Spectre howls, his howlings terrify the night

He stamps around the Anvil, beating blows of stern despair

He curses Heaven & Earth, Day & Night & Sun & Moon

He curses Forest Spring & River, Desart & sandy Waste

Cities & Nations, Families & Peoples, Tongues & Laws

Driven to desperation by Los’s terrors & threatning fears

Los cries, Obey my voice & never deviate from my will

30  And I will be merciful to thee: be thou invisible to all

To whom I make thee invisible, but chief to my own Children

O Spectre of Urthona: Reason not against their dear approach

Nor them obstruct with thy temptations of doubt & despair\[.\]

O Shame O strong & mighty Shame I break thy brazen fetters

If thou refuse, thy present torments will seem southern breezes

To what thou shalt endure if thou obey not my great will.

The Spectre answer’d. Art thou not ashamd of those thy Sins

That thou callest thy Children? lo the Law of God commands

That they be offered upon his Altar: O cruelty & torment

40  For thine are also mine\! I have kept silent hitherto,

Concerning my chief delight: but thou hast broken silence

Now I will speak my mind\! Where is my lovely Enitharmon

O thou my enemy, where is my Great Sin? She is also thine

I said: now is my grief at worst: incapable of being

Surpassed: but every moment it accumulates more & more

It continues accumulating to eternity\! the joys of God advance

For he is Righteous: he is not a Being of Pity & Compassion

He cannot feel Distress: he feeds on Sacrifice & Offering:

Delighting in cries & tears & clothd in holiness & solitude

50  But my griefs advance also, for ever & ever without end

O that I could cease to be\! Despair\! I am Despair

Created to be the great example of horror & agony: also my

Prayer is vain I called for compassion: compassion mockd

Mercy & pity threw the grave stone over me & with lead

And iron, bound it over me for ever: Life lives on my

Consuming: & the Almighty hath made me his Contrary

To be all evil, all reversed & for ever dead: knowing

And seeing life, yet living not; how can I then behold

And not tremble; how can I be beheld & not abhorrd

60  So spoke the Spectre shuddring, & dark tears ran down his shadowy face

Which Los wipd off, but comfort none could give\! or beam of hope

Yet ceasd he not from labouring at the roarings of his Forge

With iron & brass Building Golgonooza in great contendings

Till his Sons & Daughters came forth from the Furnaces

At the sublime Labours for Los, compelld the invisible Spectre

PLATE II

To labours mighty, with vast strength, with his mighty chains.

In pulsations of time, & extensions of space, like Urns of Beulah

With great labour upon his anvils & in his ladles the Ore

He lifted, pouring it into the clay ground prepar’d with art;

Striving with Systems to deliver Individuals from those Systems;

That whenever any Spectre began to devour the Dead,

He might feel the pain as if a man gnawd his own tender nerves.

Then Erin came forth from the Furnaces, & all the Daughters of Beulah

Came from the Furnaces, by Los’s mighty power for Jerusalems

10  Sake: walking up and down among the Spaces of Erin:

And the Sons and Daughters of Los came forth in perfection lovely\!

And the Spaces of Erin reach’d from the starry heighth, to the starry depth.

Los wept with exceeding joy & all wept with joy together\!

They feard they never more should see their Father, who

Was built in from Eternity, in the Cliffs of Albion.

But when the joy of meeting was exhausted in loving embrace;

Again they lament. O what shall we do for lovely Jerusalem?

To protect the Emanations of Albions mighty ones from cruelty?

Sabrina & Ignoge begin to sharpen their beamy spears

20  Of light and love: their little children stand with arrows of gold:

Ragan is wholly cruel Scofield is bound in iron armour\!

He is like a mandrake in the earth before Reubens gate:

He shoots beneath Jerusalems walls to undermine her foundations:

Vala is but thy Shadow, O thou loveliest among women\!

A shadow animated by thy tears O mournful Jerusalem\!

PLATE 12

Why wilt thou give to her a Body whose life is but a Shade?

Her joy and love, a shade: a shade of sweet repose:

But animated and vegetated, she is a devouring worm:

What shall we do for thee O lovely mild Jerusalem?



And Los said. I behold the finger of God in terrors\!

Albion is dead\! his Emanation is divided from him\!

But I am living\! yet I feel my Emanation also dividing

Such thing was never known\! O pity me, thou all-piteous-one\!

What shall I do\! or how exist, divided from Enitharmon?

10  Yet why despair\! I saw the finger of God go forth

Upon my Furnaces, from within the Wheels of Albions Sons:

Fixing their Systems, permanent: by mathematic power

Giving a body to Falshood that it may be cast off for ever.

With Demonstrative Science piercing Apollyon with his own bow\!

God is within, & without\! he is even in the depths of Hell\!



Such were the lamentations of the Labourers in the Furnaces\!

And they appeard within & without incircling on both sides

The Starry Wheels of Albions Sons, with Spaces for Jerusalem:

And for Vala the shadow of Jerusalem: the ever mourning shade:

20  On both sides, within & without beaming gloriously\!

Terrified at the sublime Wonder, Los stood before his Furnaces.

And they stood around, terrified with admiration at Erins Spaces

For the Spaces reachd from the starry heighth, to the starry depth;

And they builded Golgonooza: terrible eternal labour\!



What are those golden builders doing? where was the burying-place

Of soft Ethinthus? near Tyburns fatal Tree? is that

Mild Zions hills most ancient promontory; near mournful

Ever weeping Paddington? is that Calvary and Golgotha?

Becoming a building of pity and compassion? Lo\!

30  The stones are pity and the bricks, well wrought affections:

Enameld with love & kindness, & the tiles engraven gold

Labour of merciful hands: the beams & rafters are forgiveness:

The mortar & cement of the work, tears of honesty: the nails,

And the screws & iron braces, are well wrought blandishments,

And well contrived words, firm fixing, never forgotten,

Always comforting the remembrance: the floors, humility,

The cielings, devotion: the hearths, thanksgiving:

Prepare the furniture O Lambeth in thy pitying looms\!

The curtains, woven tears & sighs, wrought into lovely forms

40  For comfort, there the secret furniture of Jerusalems chamber

Is wrought: Lambeth\! the Bride the Lambs Wife loveth thee:

Thou art one with her & knowest not of self in thy supreme joy.

Go on, builders in hope: tho Jerusalem wanders far away,

Without the gate of Los: among the dark Satanic wheels.

Fourfold the Sons of Los in their divisions: and fourfold,

The great City of Golgonooza: fourfold toward the north

And toward the south fourfold, & fourfold toward the east & west

Each within other toward the four points: that toward

Eden, and that toward the World of Generation,

50  And that toward Beulah, and that toward Ulro:

Ulro is the space of the terrible starry wheels of Albions sons:

But that toward Eden is walled up, till time of renovation:

Yet it is perfect in its building, ornaments & perfection.

And the Four Points are thus beheld in Great Eternity

West, the Circumference: South, the Zenith: North,

The Nadir: East, the Center, unapproachable for ever.

These are the four Faces towards the Four Worlds of Humanity

In every Man. Ezekiel saw them by Chebars flood.

And the Eyes are the South, and the Nostrils are the East.

60  And the Tongue is the West, and the Ear is the North.

And the North Gate of Golgonooza toward Generation

Has four sculpturd Bulls terrible before the Gate of iron.

And iron, the Bulls: and that which looks toward Ulro,

Clay bak’d & enamel’d, eternal glowing as four furnaces:

Turning upon the Wheels of Albions sons with enormous power.

And that toward Beulah four, gold, silver, brass, & iron:

PLATE 13

And that toward Eden, four, form’d of gold, silver, brass, & iron.

The South, a golden Gate, has four Lions terrible, living\!

That toward Generation, four, of iron carv’d wondrous:  
That toward Ulro, four, clay bak’d, laborious workmanship

That toward Eden, four; immortal gold, silver, brass & iron.

The Western Gate fourfold, is closd: having four Cherubim

Its guards, living, the work of elemental hands, laborious task\!

Like Men, hermaphroditic, each winged with eight wings

That towards Generation, iron; that toward Beulah, stone;

10  That toward Ulro, clay: that toward Eden, metals.

But all clos’d up till the last day, when the graves shall yield their dead

The Eastern Gate, fourfold: terrible & deadly its ornaments:

Taking their forms from the Wheels of Albions sons; as cogs

Are formd in a wheel, to fit the cogs of the adverse wheel.

That toward Eden, eternal ice, frozen in seven folds

Of forms of death: and that toward Beulah, stone:

The seven diseases of the earth are carved terrible.

And that toward Ulro, forms of war: seven enormities:

And that toward Generation, seven generative forms.

20  And every part of the City is fourfold; & every inhabitant, fourfold.

And every pot & vessel & garment & utensil of the houses,

And every house, fourfold; but the third Gate in every one

Is closd as with a threefold curtain of ivory & fine linen & ermine.

And Luban stands in middle of the City, a moat of fire,

Surrounds Luban, Los’s Palace & the golden Looms of Cathedron.

And sixty-four thousand Genii, guard the Eastern Gate:

And sixty-four thousand Gnomes, guard the Northern Gate:

And sixty-four thousand Nymphs, guard the Western Gate:

And sixty-four thousand Fairies, guard the Southern Gate:

30  Around Golgonooza lies the land of death eternal; a Land

Of pain and misery and despair and ever brooding melancholy:

In all the Twenty-seven Heavens, numberd from Adam to Luther;

From the blue Mundane Shell, reaching to the Vegetative Earth.

The Vegetative Universe, opens like a flower from the Earths center:

In which is Eternity. It expands in Stars to the Mundane Shell

And there it meets Eternity again, both within and without,

And the abstract Voids between the Stars are the Satanic Wheels.

There is the Cave; the Rock; the Tree; the Lake of Udan Adan;

The Forest, and the Marsh, and the Pits of bitumen deadly:

40  The Rocks of solid fire: the Ice valleys: the Plains

Of burning sand: the rivers, cataract & Lakes of Fire:

The Islands of the fiery Lakes: the Trees of Malice: Revenge:

And black Anxiety; and the Cities of the Salamandrine men:

\(But whatever is visible to the Generated Man,

Is a Creation of mercy & love, from the Satanic Void.\)

The land of darkness flamed but no light, & no repose:

The land of snows of trembling, & of iron hail incessant:

The land of earthquakes: and the land of woven labyrinths:

The land of snares & traps & wheels & pit-falls & dire mills:

50  The Voids, the Solids, & the land of clouds & regions of waters:

With their inhabitants: in the Twenty-seven Heavens beneath Beulah:

Self-righteousnesses conglomerating against the Divine Vision:

A Concave Earth wondrous, Chasmal, Abyssal, Incoherent:

Forming the Mundane Shell: above; beneath: on all sides surrounding

Golgonooza: Los walks round the walls night and day.

He views the City of Golgonooza, & its smaller Cities:

The Looms & Mills & Prisons & Work-houses of Og & Anak:

The Amalekite: the Canaanite: the Moabite: the Egyptian:

And all that has existed in the space of six thousand years:

60  Permanent, & not lost not lost nor vanishd, & every little act,

Word, work, & wish, that has existed, all remaining still

In those Churches ever consuming & ever building by the Spectres

Of all the inhabitants of Earth wailing to be Created:

Shadowy to those who dwell not in them, meer possibilities:

But to those who enter into them they seem the only substances

For every thing exists & not one sigh nor smile nor tear,

PLATE 14

One hair nor particle of dust, not one can pass away.

He views the Cherub at the Tree of Life, also the Serpent,

Orc the first born coild in the south: the Dragon Urizen:

Tharmas the Vegetated Tongue even the Devouring Tongue:

A threefold region, a false brain: a false heart:

And false bowels: altogether composing the False Tongue,

Beneath Beulah: as a watry flame revolving every way

And as dark roots and stems: a Forest of affliction, growing

In seas of sorrow. Los also views the Four Females:

10  Ahania, and Enion, and Vala, and Enitharmon lovely.

And from them all the lovely beaming Daughters of Albion,

Ahania & Enion & Vala, are three evanescent shades:

Enitharmon is a vegetated mortal Wife of Los:

His Emanation, yet his Wife till the sleep of Death is past.

Such are the Buildings of Los: & such are the Woofs of Enitharmon:

And Los beheld his Sons, and he beheld his Daughters:

Every one a translucent Wonder: a Universe within,

Increasing inwards, into length and breadth, and heighth:

Starry & glorious: and they every one in their bright loins:

20  Have a beautiful golden gate which opens into the vegetative world:

And every one a gate of rubies & all sorts of precious stones

In their translucent hearts, which opens into the vegetative world:

And every one a gate of iron dreadful and wonderful,

In their translucent heads, which opens into the vegetative world

And every one has the three regions Childhood: Manhood: & Age:

But the gate of the tongue: the western gate in them is clos’d,

Having a wall builded against it: and thereby the gates

Eastward & Southward & Northward, are incircled with flaming fires.

And the North is Breadth, the South is Heighth & Depth:

30  The East is Inwards: & the West is Outwards every way.

And Los beheld the mild Emanation Jerusalem eastward bending

Her revolutions toward the Starry Wheels in maternal anguish

Like a pale cloud arising from the arms of Beulahs Daughters:

In Entuthon Benythons deep Vales beneath Golgonooza.



PLATE 15

And Hand & Hyle rooted into Jerusalem by a fibre

Of strong revenge & Skofeld Vegetated by Reubens Gate

In every Nation of the Earth till the Twelve Sons of Albion

Enrooted into every Nation: a mighty Polypus growing

From Albion over the whole Earth: such is my awful Vision.

I see the Four-fold Man. The Humanity in deadly sleep

And its fallen Emanation. The Spectre & its cruel Shadow.

I see the Past, Present & Future, existing all at once

Before me; O Divine Spirit sustain me on thy wings\!

10  That I may awake Albion from his long & cold repose.

For Bacon & Newton sheathed in dismal steel, their terrors hang

Like iron scourges over Albion. Reasonings like vast Serpents

Infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations

I turn my eyes to the Schools & Universities of Europe

And there behold the Loom of Locke whose Woof rages dire

Washd by the Water-wheels of Newton, black the cloth

In heavy wreathes folds over every Nation; cruel Works

Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic

Moving by compulsion each other: not as those in Eden: which

20  Wheel within Wheel in freedom revolve in harmony & peace.



I see in deadly fear in London Los raging round his Anvil

Of death: forming an Ax of gold: the Four Sons of Los

Stand round him cutting the Fibres from Albions hills

That Albions Sons may roll apart over the Nations

While Reuben enroots his brethren in the narrow Canaanite

From the Limit Noah to the Limit Abram in whose Loins

Reuben in his Twelve-fold majesty & beauty shall take refuge

As Abraham flees from Chaldea shaking his goary locks

But first Albion must sleep, divided from the Nations

30  I see Albion sitting upon his Rock in the first Winter

And thence I see the Chaos of Satan & the World of Adam

When the Divine Hand went forth on Albion in the mid Winter

And at the place of Death when Albion sat in Eternal Death

Among the Furnaces of Los in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom

PLATE l6

Hampstead Highgate Finchley Hendon Muswell hill: rage loud

Before Bromions iron Tongs & glowing Poker reddening fierce

Hertfordshire glows with fierce Vegetation\! in the Forests

The Oak frowns terrible, the Beech & Ash & Elm enroot

Among the Spiritual fires; loud the Corn fields thunder along

The Soldiers fife; the Harlots shriek; the Virgins dismal groan

The Parents fear: the Brothers jealousy: the Sisters curse

Beneath the Storms of Theotormon & the thundring Bellows

Heaves in the hand of Palamabron who in Londons darkness

10  Before the Anvil, watches the bellowing flames: thundering

The Hammer loud rages in Rintrahs strong grasp swinging loud

Round from heaven to earth down falling with heavy blow

Dead on the Anvil, where the red hot wedge groans in pain

He quenches it in the black trough of his Forge: Londons River

Feeds the dread Forge, trembling & shuddering along the Valleys



Humber & Trent roll dreadful before the Seventh Furnace

And Tweed & Tyne anxious to give up their Souls for Albions sake

Lincolnshire Derbyshire Nottinghamshire Leicestershire

From Oxfordshire to Norfolk on the Lake of Udan Adan

20  Labour within the Furnaces, walking among the Fires

With Ladles huge & iron Pokers over the Island white.

Scotland pours out his Sons to labour at the Furnaces

Wales gives his Daughters to the Looms; England: nursing Mothers

Gives to the Children of Albion & to the Children of Jerusalem.

From the blue Mundane Shell even to the Earth of Vegetation

Throughout the whole Creation which groans to be deliverd

Albion groans in the deep slumbers of Death upon his Rock.



Here Los fixd down the Fifty-two Counties of England & Wales

The Thirty-six of Scotland, & the Thirty-four of Ireland

30  With mighty power, when they fled out at Jerusalems Gates

Away from the Conflict of Luvah & Urizen, fixing the Gates

In the Twelve Counties of Wales & thence Gates looking every way

To the Four Points: conduct to England & Scotland & Ireland

And thence to all the Kingdoms & Nations & Families of the Earth\[.\]

The Gate of Reuben in Carmarthenshire: the Gate of Simeon in

Cardiganshire: & the Gate of Levi in Montgomeryshire

The Gate of Judah Merionethshire: the Gate of Dan Flintshire

The Gate of Napthali, Radnorshire: the Gate of Gad Pembrokeshire

The Gate of Asher, Carnarvonshire the Gate of Issachar Brecknokshire

40  The Gate of Zebulun, in Anglesea & Sodor. so is Wales divided.

The Gate of Joseph, Denbighshire: the Gate of Benjamin Glamorganshire

For the protection of the Twelve Emanations of Albions Sons

And the Forty Counties of England are thus divided in the Gates

Of Reuben Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex. Simeon Lincoln, York Lancashire

Levi. Middlesex Kent Surrey. Judah Somerset Glouster Wiltshire.

Dan. Cornwall Devon Dorset, Napthali., Warwick Leicester Worcester

Gad. Oxford Bucks Harford. Asher, Sussex Hampshire Berkshire

Issachar, Northampton Rutland Nottgham. Zebulun Bedford Huntgn Camb

Joseph Stafford Shrops Heref. Benjamin, Derby Cheshire Monmouth;

50  And Cumberland Northumberland Westmoreland & Durham are

Divided in the Gates of Reuben, Judah Dan & Joseph

And the Thirty-six Counties of Scotland, divided in the Gates

Of Reuben Kincard Haddntn Forfar, Simeon Ayr Argyll Banff

Levi Edinburh Roxbro Ross. Judah, Abrdeen Berwik Dumfries

Dan Bute Caitnes Clakmanan. Napthali Nairn Invernes Linlithgo

Gad Peebles Perth Renfru. Asher Sutherlan Sterling Wigtoun

Issachar Selkirk Dumbartn Glasgo. Zebulun Orkney Shetland Skye

Joseph Elgin Lanerk Kinros. Benjamin Kromarty Murra Kirkubriht

Governing all by the sweet delights of secret amorous glances

60  In Enitharmons Halls builded by Los & his mighty Children

All things acted on Earth are seen in the bright Sculptures of

Los’s Halls & every Age renews its powers from these Works

With every pathetic story possible to happen from Hate or

Wayward Love & every sorrow & distress is carved here

Every Affinity of Parents Marriages & Friendships are here

In all their various combinations wrought with wondrous Art

All that can happen to Man in his pilgrimage of seventy years

Such is the Divine Written Law of Horeb & Sinai:

And such the Holy Gospel of Mount Olivet & Calvary:

PLATE 17

His Spectre divides & Los in fury compells it to divide:

To labour in the fire, in the water, in the earth, in the air,

To follow the Daughters of Albion as the hound follows the scent

Of the wild inhabitant of the forest, to drive them from his own:

To make a way for the Children of Los to come from the Furnaces

But Los himself against Albions Sons his fury bends, for he

Dare not approach the Daughters openly lest he be consumed

In the fires of their beauty & perfection & be Vegetated beneath

Their Looms, in a Generation of death & resurrection to forgetfulness

10  They wooe Los continually to subdue his strength: he continually

Shews them his Spectre: sending him abroad over the four points of heaven

In the fierce desires of beauty & in the tortures of repulse\! He is

The Spectre of the Living pursuing the Emanations of the Dead.

Shuddring they flee: they hide in the Druid Temples in cold chastity:

Subdued by the Spectre of the Living & terrified by undisguisd desire.

For Los said: Tho my Spectre is divided: as I am a Living Man

I must compell him to obey me wholly: that Enitharmon may not

Be lost: & lest he should devour Enitharmon: Ah me\!

Piteous image of my soft desires & loves: O Enitharmon\!

20  I will compell my Spectre to obey: I will restore to thee thy Children.

No one bruises or starves himself to make himself fit for labour\!

Tormented with sweet desire for these beauties of Albion

They would never love my power if they did not seek to destroy

Enitharmon: Vala would never have sought & loved Albion

If she had not sought to destroy Jerusalem; such is that false

And Generating Love: a pretence of love to destroy love:

Cruel hipocrisy unlike the lovely delusions of Beulah:

And cruel forms, unlike the merciful forms of Beulahs Night

They know not why they love nor wherefore they sicken & die

30  Calling that Holy Love: which is Envy Revenge & Cruelty

Which separated the stars from the mountains: the mountains from Man

And left Man, a little grovelling Root, outside of Himself.

Negations are not Contraries: Contraries mutally Exist:

But Negations Exist Not: Exceptions & Objections & Unbeliefs

Exist not: nor shall they ever be Organized for ever & ever:

If thou separate from me, thou art a Negation: a meer

Reasoning & Derogation from me, an Objecting & cruel Spite

And Malice & Envy: but my Emanation, Alas\! will become

My Contrary: O thou Negation, I will continually compell

40  Thee to be invisible to any but whom I please, & when

And where & how I please, and never\! never\! shalt thou be Organized

But as a distorted & reversed Reflexion in the Darkness

And in the Non Entity: nor shall that which is above

Ever descend into thee: but thou shalt be a Non Entity for ever

And if any enter into thee, thou shalt be an Unquenchable Fire

And he shall be a never dying Worm, mutually tormented by

Those that thou tormentest, a Hell & Despair for ever & ever.



So Los in secret with himself communed & Enitharmon heard

In her darkness & was comforted: yet still she divided away

50  In gnawing pain from Los’s bosom in the deadly Night;

First as a red Globe of blood trembling beneath his bosom\[.\]

Suspended over her he hung: he infolded her in his garments

Of wool: he hid her from the Spectre, in shame & confusion of

Face; in terrors & pains of Hell & Eternal Death, the

Trembling Globe shot forth Self-living & Los howld over it:

Feeding it with his groans & tears day & night without ceasing:

And the Spectrous Darkness from his back divided in temptations,

And in grinding agonies in threats: stiflings: & direful strugglings.



Go thou to Skofield: ask him if he is Bath or if he is Canterbury

60  Tell him to be no more dubious: demand explicit words

Tell him: I will dash him into shivers, where & at what time

I please: tell Hand & Skofield they are my ministers of evil

To those I hate: for I can hate also as well as they\!

PLATE 18

From every-one of the Four Regions of Human Majesty,

There is an Outside spread Without, & an Outside spread Within

Beyond the Outline of Identity both ways, which meet in One:

An orbed Void of doubt, despair, hunger, & thirst & sorrow.

Here the Twelve Sons of Albion, join’d in dark Assembly,

Jealous of Jerusalems children, asham’d of her little-ones

\(For Vala produc’d the Bodies. Jerusalem gave the Souls\)

Became as Three Immense Wheels, turning upon one-another

Into Non-Entity, and their thunders hoarse appall the Dead

10  To murder their own Souls, to build a Kingdom among the Dead

Cast\! Cast ye Jerusalem forth\! The Shadow of delusions\!

The Harlot daughter\! Mother of pity and dishonourable forgiveness

Our Father Albions sin and shame\! But father now no more\!

Nor sons. nor hateful peace & love, nor soft complacencies

With transgressors meeting in brotherhood around the table,

Or in the porch or garden. No more the sinful delights

Of age and youth and boy and girl and animal and herb,

And river and mountain, and city & village, and house & family,

Beneath the Oak & Palm, beneath the Vine and Fig-tree,

20  In self-denial\! – But War and deadly contention, Between

Father and Son, and light and love\! All bold asperities

Of Haters met in deadly strife, rending the house & garden

The unforgiving porches, the tables of enmity, and beds

And chambers of trembling & suspition, hatreds of age & youth

And boy & girl, & animal & herb, & river & mountain

And city & village, and house & family. That the Perfect,

May live in glory, redeem’d by Sacrifice of the Lamb

And of his children, before sinful Jerusalem. To build

Babylon the City of Vala, the Goddess Virgin-Mother.

30  She is our Mother\! Nature\! Jerusalem is our Harlot-Sister

Return’d with Children of pollution, to defile our House,

With Sin and Shame. Cast\! Cast her into the Potters field.

Her little-ones, She must slay upon our Altars: and her aged

Parents must be carried into captivity, to redeem her Soul

To be for a Shame & a Curse, and to be our Slaves for ever

So cry Hand & Hyle the eldest of the fathers of Albions

Little-ones; to destroy the Divine Saviour; the Friend of Sinners,

Building Castles in desolated places, and strong Fortifications.

Soon Hand mightily devour’d & absorb’d Albions Twelve Sons.

40  Out from his bosom a mighty Polypus, vegetating in darkness,

And Hyle & Coban were his two chosen ones, for Emissaries

In War: forth from his bosom they went and return’d,

Like Wheels from a great Wheel reflected in the Deep.

Hoarse turn’d the Starry Wheels, rending a way in Albions Loins

Beyond the Night of Beulah. In a dark & unknown Night,

Outstretch’d his Giant beauty on the ground in pain & tears:

PLATE 19

His Children exil’d from his breast pass to and fro before him

His birds are silent on his hills, flocks die beneath his branches

His tents are fall’n\! his trumpets, and the sweet sound of his harp

Are silent on his clouded hills, that belch forth storms & fire.

His milk of Cows, & honey of Bees, & fruit of golden harvest,

Is gather’d in the scorching heat, & in the driving rain:

Where once he sat he weary walks in misery and pain:

His Giant beauty and perfection fallen into dust:

Till from within his witherd breast grown narrow with his woes:

10  The corn is turn’d to thistles & the apples into poison:

The birds of song to murderous crows, his joys to bitter groans\!

The voices of children in his tents, to cries of helpless infants\!

And self-exiled from the face of light & shine of morning,

In the dark world a narrow house\! he wanders up and down,

Seeking for rest and finding none\! and hidden far within,

His Eon weeping in the cold and desolated Earth.

All his Affections now appear withoutside: all his Sons,

Hand, Hyle & Coban, Guantok, Peachey, Brereton, Slayd & Hutton,

Scofeld, Kox, Kotope & Bowen; his Twelve Sons: Satanic Mill\!

20  Who are the Spectres of the Twentyfour, each Double-form’d:

Revolve upon his mountains groaning in pain: beneath

The dark incessant sky, seeking for rest and finding none:

Raging against their Human natures, ravning to gormandize

The Human majesty and beauty of the Twentyfour,

Condensing them into solid rocks with cruelty and abhorrence

Suspition & revenge, & the seven diseases of the Soul

Settled around Albion and around Luvah in his secret cloud\[.\]

Willing the Friends endur’d, for Albions sake, and for

Jerusalem his Emanation shut within his bosom;

30  Which hardend against them more and more; as he builded onwards

On the Gulph of Death in self-righteousness, that roll’d

Before his awful feet, in pride of virtue for victory:

And Los was roofd in from Eternity in Albions Cliffs

Which stand upon the ends of Beulah, and withoutside, all

Appear’d a rocky form against the Divine Humanity.

Albions Circumference was clos’d: his Center began darkning

Into the Night of Beulah, and the Moon of Beulah rose

Clouded with storms: Los his strong Guard walkd round

beneath the Moon

And Albion fled inward among the currents of his rivers.

40  He found Jerusalem upon the River of his City soft repos’d

In the arms of Vala, assimilating in one with Vala

The Lilly of Havilah: and they sang soft thro’ Lambeths vales,

In a sweet moony night & silence that they had created

With a blue sky spread over with wings and a mild moon,

Dividing & uniting into many female forms: Jerusalem

Trembling\! then in one comingling in eternal tears,

Sighing to melt his Giant beauty, on the moony river.



PLATE 20

But when they saw Albion fall’n upon mild Lambeths vale:

Astonish’d\! Terrified\! they hover’d over his Giant limbs.

Then thus Jerusalem spoke, while Vala wove the veil of tears:

Weeping in pleadings of Love, in the web of despair.

Wherefore hast thou shut me into the winter of human life

And clos’d up the sweet regions of youth and virgin innocence:

Where we live, forgetting error, not pondering on evil:

Among my lambs & brooks of water, among my warbling birds:

Where we delight in innocence before the face of the Lamb:

10  Going in and out before him in his love and sweet affection.

Vala replied weeping & trembling, hiding in her veil.

When winter rends the hungry family and the snow falls:

Upon the ways of men hiding the paths of man and beast,

Then mourns the wanderer: then he repents his wanderings & eyes

The distant forest; then the slave groans in the dungeon of stone.

The captive in the mill of the stranger, sold for scanty hire.

They view their former life: they number moments over and over;

Stringing them on their remembrance as on a thread of sorrow.

Thou art my sister and my daughter\! thy shame is mine also\!

20  Ask me not of my griefs\! thou knowest all my griefs.

Jerusalem answer’d with soft tears over the valleys.

O Vala what is Sin? that thou shudderest and weepest

At sight of thy once lov’d Jerusalem\! What is Sin but a little

Error & fault that is soon forgiven; but mercy is not a Sin

Nor pity nor love nor kind forgiveness\! O\! if I have Sinned

Forgive & pity me\! O\! unfold thy Veil in mercy & love\!

Slay not my little ones, beloved Virgin daughter of Babylon

Slay not my infant loves & graces, beautiful daughter of Moab

I cannot put off the human form I strive but strive in vain

30  When Albion rent thy beautiful net of gold and silver twine;

Thou hadst woven it with art, thou hadst caught me in the bands

Of love; thou refusedst to let me go: Albion beheld thy beauty

Beautiful thro’ our Love’s comeliness, beautiful thro’ pity.

The Veil shone with thy brightness in the eyes of Albion,

Because it inclosd pity & love; because we lov’d one-another\!

Albion lov’d thee\! he rent thy Veil\! he embrac’d thee\! he lov’d thee\!

Astonish’d at his beauty & perfection, thou forgavest his furious love:

I redounded from Albions bosom in my virgin loveliness.

The Lamb of God reciev’d me in his arms he smil’d upon us:

40  He made me his Bride & Wife: he gave thee to Albion.

Then was a time of love: O why is it passed away\!



Then Albion broke silence and with groans reply’d



PLATE 21

O Vala\! O Jerusalem\! do you delight in my groans

You O lovely forms, you have prepared my death-cup:

The disease of Shame covers me from head to feet: I have no hope

Every boil upon my body is a separate & deadly Sin.

Doubt first assaild me, then Shame took possession of me

Shame divides Families. Shame hath divided Albion in sunder\!

First fled my Sons, & then my Daughters, then my Wild Animations

My Cattle next, last ev’n the Dog of my Gate. the Forests fled

The Corn-fields, & the breathing Gardens outside separated

10  The Sea; the Stars: the Sun: the Moon: drivn forth by my disease

All is Eternal Death unless you can weave a chaste

Body over an unchaste Mind\! Vala\! O that thou wert pure\!

That the deep wound of Sin might be clos’d up with the Needle,

And with the Loom: to cover Gwendolen & Ragan with costly Robes

Of Natural Virtue\[,\] for their Spiritual forms without a Veil

Wither in Luvahs Sepulcher. I thrust him from my presence

And all my Children followd his loud howlings into the Deep.

Jerusalem\! dissembler Jerusalem\! I look into thy bosom:

I discover thy secret places: Cordella\! I behold

20  Thee whom I thought pure as the heavens in innocence &fear:

Thy Tabernacle taken down, thy secret Cherubim disclosed

Art thou broken? Ah me Sabrina, running by my side:

In childhood what wert thou? unutterable anguish\! Conwenna

Thy cradled infancy is most piteous. O hide, O hide\!

Their secret gardens were made paths to the traveller:

I knew not of their secret loves with those I hated most,

Nor that their every thought was Sin & secret appetite\[.\]

Hyle sees in fear, he howls in fury over them, Hand sees

In jealous fear: in stern accusation with cruel stripes

30  He drives them thro’ the Streets of Babylon before my face:

Because they taught Luvah to rise into my clouded heavens

Battersea and Chelsea mourn for Cambel & Gwendolen\!

Hackney and Holloway sicken for Estrild & Ignoge\!

Because the Peak, Malvern & Cheviot Reason in Cruelty

Penmaenmawr & Dhinas-bran Demonstrate in Unbelief

Manchester & Liverpool are in tortures of Doubt & Despair

Malden & Colchester Demonstrate: I hear my Childrens voices

I see their piteous faces gleam out upon the cruel winds

From Lincoln & Norwich, from Edinburgh & Monmouth:

40  I see them distant from my bosom scourgd along the roads

Then lost in clouds; I hear their tender voices\! clouds divide

I see them die beneath the whips of the Captains\! they are taken

In solemn pomp into Chaldea across the bredths of Europe

Six months they lie embalmd in silent death: worshipped

Carried in Arks of Oak before the armies in the spring

Bursting their Arks they rise again to life: they play before

The Armies: I hear their loud cymbals & their deadly cries

Are the Dead cruel? are those who are infolded in moral Law

Revengeful? O that Death & Annihilation were the same\!

50  Then Vala answerd spreading her scarlet Veil over Albion

PLATE 22

Albion thy fear has made me tremble; thy terrors have surrounded me

Thy Sons have naild me on the Gates piercing my hands & feet:

Till Skofields Nimrod the mighty Huntsman \[of\] Jehovah came,

With Cush his Son & took me down. He in a golden Ark,

Bears me before his Armies tho my shadow hovers here

The flesh of multitudes fed & nourisd me in my childhood

My morn & evening food were prepard in Battles of Men

Great is the cry of the Hounds of Nimrod along the Valley

Of Vision, they scent the odor of War in the Valley of Vision.

10  All Love is lost\! terror succeeds & Hatred instead of Love

And stern demands of Right & Duty instead of Liberty

Once thou wast to me the loveliest Son of heaven; but now

Where shall I hide from thy dread countenance & searching eyes

I have looked into the secret Soul of him I loved

And in the dark recesses found Sin & can never return.

Albion again utterd his voice beneath the silent Moon

I brought Love into light of day to pride in chaste beauty

I brought Love into light & fancied Innocence is no more

Then spoke Jerusalem O Albion\! my Father Albion

20  Why wilt thou number every little fibre of my Soul

Spreading them out before the Sun like stalks of flax to dry?

The Infant Joy is beautiful, but its anatomy

Horrible ghast & deadly\! nought shalt thou find in it

But dark despair & everlasting brooding melancholy\!

Then Albion turnd his face toward Jerusalem & spoke

Hide thou Jerusalem in impalpable voidness, not to be

Touchd by the hand nor seen with the eye: O Jerusalem

Would thou wert not & that thy place might never be found

But come O Vala with knife & cup: drain my blood

30  To the last drop\! then hide me in thy Scarlet Tabernacle

For I see Luvah whom I slew. I behold him in my Spectre

As I behold Jerusalem in thee O Vala dark and cold

Jerusalem then stretchd her hand toward the Moon & spoke

Why should Punishment Weave the Veil with Iron Wheels of War

When Forgiveness might it Weave with Wings of Cherubim

Loud groand Albion from mountain to mountain & replied



PLATE 23

Jerusalem\! Jerusalem\! deluding shadow of Albion\!

Daughter of my phantasy\! unlawful pleasure\! Albions curse\!

I came here with intention to annihilate thee\! But

My soul is melted away, inwoven within the Veil

Hast thou again knitted the Veil of Vala, which I for thee

Pitying rent in ancient times. I see it whole and more

Perfect, and shining with beauty\! But thou\! O wretched Father\!

Jerusalem reply’d, like a voice heard from a sepulcher:

Father\! once piteous\! Is Pity a Sin? Embalm’d in Vala’s bosom

10  In an Eternal Death for Albions sake, our best beloved.

Thou art my Father & my Brother: Why hast thou hidden me,

Remote from the divine Vision: my Lord and Saviour.

Trembling stood Albion at her words in jealous dark despair:

He felt that Love and Pity are the same; a soft repose\!

Inward complacency of Soul: a Self-annihilation\!

I have erred\! I am ashamed\! and will never return more:

I have taught my children sacrifices of cruelty: what shall I answer?

I will hide it from Eternals\! I will give myself for my Children\!

Which way soever I turn, I behold Humanity and Pity\!

20  He recoil’d: he rush’d outwards; he bore the Veil whole away

His fires redound from his Dragon Altars in Errors returning.

He drew the Veil of Moral Virtue, woven for Cruel Laws,

And cast it into the Atlantic Deep, to catch the Souls of the Dead.

He stood between the Palm tree & the Oak of weeping

Which stand upon the edge of Beulah; and there Albion sunk

Down in sick pallid languor\! These were his last words, relapsing\!

Hoarse from his rocks, from caverns of Derbyshire & Wales

And Scotland, utter’d from the Circumference into Eternity.

Blasphemous Sons of Feminine delusion\! God in the dreary Void

30  Dwells from Eternity, wide separated from the Human Soul

But thou deluding Image by whom imbu’d the Veil I rent

Lo here is Valas Veil whole, for a Law, a Terror & a Curse\!

And therefore God takes vengeance on me: from my clay-cold bosom

My children wander trembling victims of his Moral Justice.

His snows fall on me and cover me, while in the Veil I fold

My dying limbs. Therefore O Manhood, if thou art aught

But a meer Phantasy, hear dying Albions Curse\!

May God who dwells in this dark Ulro & voidness, vengeance take,

And draw thee down into this Abyss of sorrow and torture,

40  Like me thy Victim. O that Death & Annihilation were the same\!



PLATE 24

What have I said? What have I done? O all-powerful Human Words:

You recoil back upon me in the blood of the Lamb slain in his Children.

Two bleeding Contraries equally true, are his Witnesses against me

We reared mighty Stones: we danced naked around them:

Thinking to bring Love into light of day, to Jerusalems shame:

Displaying our Giant limbs to all the winds of heaven\! Sudden

Shame siezd us, we could not look on one-another for abhorrence: the Blue

Of our immortal Veins & all their Hosts fled from our Limbs,

And wanderd distant in a dismal Night clouded & dark:

10  The Sun fled from the Britons forehead: the Moon from his mighty loins:

Scandinavia fled with all his mountains filld with groans.



O what is Life & what is Man. O what is Death\! Wherefore

Are you my Children, natives in the Grave to where I go

Or are you born to feed the hungry ravenings of Destruction

To be the sport of Accident\! to waste in Wrath & Love, a weary

Life, in brooding cares & anxious labours, that prove but chaff.

O Jerusalem Jerusalem I have forsaken thy Courts

Thy Pillars of ivory & gold: thy Curtains of silk & fine

Linen: thy Pavements of precious stones: thy Walls of pearl

20  And gold, thy Gates of Thanksgiving thy Windows of Praise:

Thy Clouds of Blessing; thy Cherubims of Tender-mercy

Stretching their Wings sublime over the Little-ones of Albion\[.\]

O Human Imagination O Divine Body I have Crucified

I have turned my back upon thee into the Wastes of Moral Law:

There Babylon is builded in the Waste, founded in Human desolation.

O Babylon thy Watchman stands over thee in the night

Thy severe Judge all the day long proves thee O Babylon

With provings of destruction, with giving thee thy hearts desire.

But Albion is cast forth to the Potter his Children to the Builders

30  To build Babylon because they have forsaken Jerusalem

The Walls of Babylon are Souls of Men: her Gates the Groans

Of Nations; her Towers are the Miseries of once happy Families.

Her Streets are paved with Destruction, her Houses built with Death

Her Palaces with Hell & the Grave; her Synagogues with Torments

Of ever-hardening Despair squard & polishd with cruel skill

Yet thou wast lovely as the summer cloud upon my hills

When Jerusalem was thy hearts desire in times of youth & love.

Thy Sons came to Jerusalem with gifts, she sent them away

With blessings on their hands & on their feet, blessings of gold,

40  And pearl & diamond: thy Daughters sang in her Courts:

They came up to Jerusalem; they walked before Albion

In the Exchanges of London every Nation walkd

And London walkd in every Nation mutual in love & harmony

Albion coverd the whole Earth, England encompassd the Nations,

Mutual each within others bosom in Visions of Regeneration;

Jerusalem coverd the Atlantic Mountains & the Erythrean,

From bright Japan & China to Hesperia France & England.

Mount Zion lifted his head in every Nation under heaven:

And the Mount of Olives was beheld over the whole Earth:

50  The footsteps of the Lamb of God were there: but now no more

No more shall I behold him, he is closd in Luvahs Sepulcher.

Yet why these smitings of Luvah, the gentlest mildest Zoa?

If God was Merciful this could not be: O Lamb of God

Thou art a delusion and Jerusalem is my Sin\! O my Children

I have educated you in the crucifying cruelties of Demonstration

Till you have assum’d the Providence of God & slain your Father

Dost thou appear before me who liest dead in Luvahs Sepulcher

Dost thou forgive me\! thou who wast Dead & art Alive?

Look not so merciful upon me O thou Slain Lamb of God

60  I die\! I die in thy arms tho Hope is banishd from me.

Thundring the Veil rushes from his hand Vegetating Knot by

Knot, Day by Day, Night by Night; loud roll the indignant Atlantic

Waves & the Erythrean, turning up the bottoms of the Deeps

PLATE 25

And there was heard a great lamenting in Beulah: all the Regions

Of Beulah were moved as the tender bowels are moved: & they said:

Why did you take Vengeance O ye Sons of the mighty Albion?

Planting these Oaken Groves: Erecting these Dragon Temples

Injury the Lord heals but Vengeance cannot be healed:

As the Sons of Albion have done to Luvah: so they have in him

Done to the Divine Lord & Saviour, who suffers with those that suffer:

For not one sparrow can suffer, & the whole Universe not suffer also,

In all its Regions, & its Father & Saviour not pity and weep.

10  But Vengeance is the destroyer of Grace & Repentance in the bosom

Of the Injurer: in which the Divine Lamb is cruelly slain:

Descend O Lamb of God & take away the imputation of Sin

By the Creation of States & the deliverance of Individuals Evermore Amen

Thus wept they in Beulah over the Four Regions of Albion

But many doubted & despaird & imputed Sin & Righteousness

To Individuals & not to States, and these Slept in Ulro.



PLATE 26

SUCH VISIONS HAVE APPEARD TO ME  
  AS I MY ORDERD RACE HAVE RUN  
   JERUSALEM IS NAMED LIBERTY  
    AMONG THE SONS OF ALBION

PLATE 27

TO  THE  JEWS

    Jerusalem the Emanation of the Giant Albion\! Can it be? Is it a Truth that the Learned have explored? Was Britain the Primitive Seat of the Patriarchal Religion? If it is true: my title-page is also True, that Jerusalem was & is the Emanation of the Giant Albion. It is True, and cannot be controverted. Ye are united O ye inhabitants of Earth in One Religion. The Religion of Jesus: the most Ancient, the Eternal: & the Everlasting Gospel – The Wicked will turn it to Wickedness, the Righteous to Righteousness,

10  Amen\! Huzza\! Selah\!

    ‘All things Begin & End in Albions Ancient Druid Rocky Shore.’

    Your Ancestors derived their origin from Abraham, Heber, Shem, and Noah, who were Druids: as the Druid Temples \(which are the Patriarchal Pillars & Oak Groves\) over the whole Earth witness to this day.

You have a tradition, that Man anciently containd in his mighty limbs all things in Heaven & Earth: this you recieved from the Druids

20  ‘But now the Starry Heavens are fled from the mighty limbs of Albion’

      Albion was the Parent of the Druids; & in his Chaotic State of Sleep

      Satan & Adam & the whole World was Created by the Elohim.

  The fields from Islington to Marybone,  
To Primrose Hill and Saint Johns Wood:  
  Were builded over with pillars of gold,  
And there Jerusalems pillars stood.

  Her Little-ones ran on the fields  
The Lamb of God among them seen  
  And fair Jerusalem his Bride:  
Among the little meadows green.

    Pancrass & Kentish-town repose

10  Among her golden pillars high:

        Among her golden arches which

Shine upon the starry sky.

  The Jews-harp-house & the Green Man;  
The Ponds where Boys to bathe delight:  
  The fields of Cows by Willans farm:  
Shine in Jerusalems pleasant sight.

20    She walks upon our meadows green:

    The Lamb of God walks by her side:

  And every English Child is seen,

    Children of Jesus & his Bride,

  Forgiving trespasses and sins  
Lest Babylon with cruel Og,  
  With Moral & Self-righteous Law  
Should Crucify in Satans Synagogue\!

  What are those golden Builders doing  
Near mournful ever-weeping Paddington  
  Standing above that mighty Ruin  
Where Satan the first victory won.

30    Where Albion slept beneath the Fatal Tree

    And the Druids golden Knife,

  Rioted in human gore,

    In Offerings of Human Life

  They groan’d aloud on London Stone  
They groan’d aloud on Tyburns Brook  
  Albion gave his deadly groan,  
And all the Atlantic Mountains shook

40    Albions Spectre from his Loins  
    Tore forth in all the pomp of War\!  
        Satan his name: in flames of fire  
    He stretch’d his Druid Pillars far.

  Jerusalem fell from Lambeth’s Vale,  
Down thro Poplar & Old Bow;  
  Thro Malden & acros the Sea,  
In War & howling death & woe.

  The Rhine was red with human blood:  
The Danube rolld a purple tide:  
  On the Euphrates Satan stood:  
And over Asia stretch’d his pride.

50    He witherd up sweet Zions Hill,  
    From every Nation of the Earth:  
       He witherd up Jerusalems Gates,  
    And in a dark Land gave her birth.

  He witherd up the Human Form,  
By laws of sacrifice for sin:  
  Till it became a Mortal Worm:  
But O\! translucent all within.

  The Divine Vision still was seen  
Still was the Human Form, Divine  
  Weeping in weak & mortal clay

60  O Jesus still the Form was thine.

  And thine the Human Face & thine  
The Human Hands & Feet & Breath  
  Entering thro’ the Gates of Birth  
And passing thro’ the Gates of Death

  And O thou Lamb of God, whom I  
Slew in my dark self-righteous pride:  
  Art thou return’d to Albions Land\!  
And is Jerusalem thy Bride?

  Come to my arms & never more

70  Depart; but dwell for ever here:  
        Create my Spirit to thy Love:  
       Subdue my Spectre to thy Fear.

  Spectre of Albion\! warlike Fiend\!  
In clouds of blood & ruin roll’d:  
  I here reclaim thee as my own  
My Selfhood\! Satan\! armd in gold.

  Is this thy soft Family-Love  
Thy cruel Patriarchal pride  
  Planting thy Family alone,

80  Destroying all the World beside.

  A mans worst enemies are those  
Of his own house & family;  
  And he who makes his law a curse,  
By his own law shall surely die.

  In my Exchanges every Land  
Shall walk, & mine in every Land,  
  Mutual shall build Jerusalem:  
Both heart in heart & hand in hand.

If Humility is Christianity; you O Jews are the true

90  Christians; If your tradition that Man contained in his

Limbs, all Animals, is True & they were separated from him by cruel Sacrifices: and when compulsory cruel Sacrifices had brought Humanity into a Feminine Tabernacle, in the loins of Abraham & David: the Lamb of God, the Saviour became apparent on Earth as the Prophets had foretold? The Return of Israel is a Return to Mental Sacrifice & War. Take up the Cross O Israel & follow Jesus.

PLATE 28

JERUSALEM

CHAP: 2

Every ornament of perfection, and every labour of love,  
In all the Garden of Eden, & in all the golden mountains

Was become an envied horror, and a remembrance of jealousy:

And every Act a Crime, and Albion the punisher & judge.

And Albion spoke from his secret seat and said

All these ornaments are crimes, they are made by the labours

Of loves: of unnatural consanguinities and friendships

Horrid to think of when enquired deeply into; and all

These hills & valleys are accursed witnesses of Sin

10  I therefore condense them into solid rocks, stedfast\!

A foundation and certainty and demonstrative truth:

That Man be separate from Man, & here I plant my seat.

Cold snows drifted around him: ice coverd his loins around

He sat by Tyburns brook, and underneath his heel, shot up\!

A deadly Tree, he nam’d it Moral Virtue, and the Law

Of God who dwells in Chaos hidden from the human sight.

The Tree spread over him its cold shadows, \(Albion groand\)

They bent down, they felt the earth and again enrooting

Shot into many a Tree\! an endless labyrinth of woe\!

20  From willing sacrifice of Self, to sacrifice of \(miscall’d\) Enemies

For Atonement: Albion began to erect twelve Altars,

Of rough unhewn rocks, before the Potters Furnace

He nam’d them Justice, and Truth. And Albions Sons

Must have become the first Victims, being the first transgressors

But they fled to the mountains to seek ransom: building A Strong

Fortification against the Divine Humanity and Mercy,

In Shame & Jealousy to annihilate Jerusalem\!

PLATE 29 \[33\]

Turning his back to the Divine Vision, his Spectrous

Chaos before his face appeard: an Unformed Memory.

Then spoke the Spectrous Chaos to Albion darkning cold

From the back & loins where dwell the Spectrous Dead

I am your Rational Power O Albion & that Human Form

You call Divine, is but a Worm seventy inches long

That creeps forth in a night & is dried in the morning sun

In fortuitous concourse of memorys accumulated & lost

It plows the Earth in its own conceit, it overwhelms the Hills

10  Beneath its winding labyrinths, till a stone of the brook

Stops it in midst of its pride among its hills & rivers\[.\]

Battersea & Chelsea mourn, London & Canterbury tremble

Their place shall not be found as the wind passes over.

The ancient Cities of the Earth remove as a traveller

And shall Albions Cities remain when I pass over them

With my deluge of forgotten remembrances over the tablet

So spoke the Spectre to Albion, he is the Great Selfhood

Satan: Worshipd as God by the Mighty Ones of the Earth

Having a white Dot calld a Center from which branches out

20  A Circle in continual gyrations, this became a Heart

From which sprang numerous branches varying their motions

Producing many Heads three or seven or ten, & hands & feet

Innumerable at will of the unfortunate contemplator

Who becomes his food\[:\] such is the way of the Devouring Power

And this is the cause of the appearance in the frowning Chaos\[.\]

Albions Emanation which he had hidden in Jealousy

Appeard now in the frowning Chaos prolific upon the Chaos

Reflecting back to Albion in Sexual Reasoning Hermaphroditic

Albion spoke. Who art thou that appearest in gloomy pomp

30  Involving the Divine Vision in colours of autumn ripeness

I never saw thee till this time, nor beheld life abstracted

Nor darkness immingled with light on my furrowd field

Whence camest thou\! who art thou O loveliest? the Divine Vision

Is as nothing before thee, faded is all life and joy

Vala replied in clouds of tears Albions garment embracing

I was a City & a Temple built by Albions Children.

I was a Garden planted with beauty I allured on hill & valley

The River of Life to flow against my walls & among my trees

Vala was Albions Bride & Wife in great Eternity

40  The loveliest of the daughters of Eternity when in day-break

I emanated from Luvah over the Towers of Jerusalem

And in her Courts among her little Children offering up

The Sacrifice of fanatic love\! why loved I Jerusalem:

Why was I one with her embracing in the Vision of Jesus

Wherefore did I loving create love, which never yet

Immingled God & Man, when thou & I, hid the Divine Vision

In cloud of secret gloom which behold involve me round about

Know me now Albion: look upon me I alone am Beauty

The Imaginative Human Form is but a breathing of Vala

50  I breathe him forth into the Heaven from my secret Cave

Born of the Woman to obey the Woman O Albion the mighty

For the Divine appearance is Brotherhood, but I am Love

PLATE 30\[34\]

Elevate into the Region of Brotherhood with my red fires



Art thou Vala? replied Albion, image of my repose

O how I tremble\! how my members pour down milky fear\!

A dewy garment covers me all over, all manhood is gone:

At thy word & at thy look death enrobes me about

From head to feet, a garment of death & eternal fear

Is not that Sun thy husband & that Moon thy glimmering Veil?

Are not the Stars of heaven thy Children\! art thou not Babylon?

Art thou Nature Mother of all\! is Jerusalem thy Daughter

10  Why have thou elevate inward: O dweller of outward chambers

From grot & cave beneath the Moon dim region of death

Where I laid my Plow in the hot noon, where my hot team fed

Where implements of War are forged, the Plow to go over the Nations

In pain girding me round like a rib of iron in heaven: O Vala

In Eternity they neither marry nor are given in marriage

Albion the high Cliff of the Atlantic is become a barren Land

Los stood at his Anvil: he heard the contentions of Vala –

He heavd his thundring Bellows upon the valleys of Middlesex

He opend his Furnaces before Vala, then Albion frownd in anger

20  On his Rock: ere yet the Starry Heavens were fled away

From his awful Members, and thus Los cried aloud

To the Sons of Albion & to Hand the eldest Son of Albion

I hear the screech of Childbirth loud pealing, & the groans

Of Death, in Albions clouds dreadful utterd over all the Earth

What may Man be? who can tell\! but what may Woman be?

To have power over Man from Cradle to corruptible Grave.

There is a Throne in every Man, it is the Throne of God

This Woman has claimd as her own & Man is no more\!

Albion is the Tabernacle of Vala & her Temple

30  And not the Tabernacle & Temple of the Most High

O Albion why wilt thou Create a Female Will?

To hide the most evident God in a hidden covert, even

In the shadows of a Woman & a secluded Holy Place

That we may pry after him as after a stolen treasure

Hidden among the Dead & mured up from the paths of life

Hand\! art thou not Reuben enrooting thyself into Bashan

Till thou remainest a vaporous Shadow in a Void\! O Merlin\!

Unknown among the Dead where never before Existence came

Is this the Female Will O ye lovely Daughters of Albion. To

40  Converse concerning Weight & Distance in the Wilds of Newton & Locke

So Los spoke standing on Mam-Tor looking over Europe & Asia

The Graves thunder beneath his feet from Ireland to Japan

Reuben slept in Bashan like one dead in the valley

Cut off from Albions mountains & from all the Earths summits

Between Succoth & Zaretan beside the Stone of Bohan

While the Daughters of Albion divided Luvah into three Bodies

Los bended his Nostrils down to the Earth, then sent him over

Jordan to the Land of the Hittite: every-one that saw him

Fled\! they fled at his horrible Form: they hid in caves

50  And dens, they looked to one-another & became what they beheld

Reuben return’d to Bashan, in despair he slept on the Stone.

Then Gwendolen divided into Rahab & Tirza in Twelve Portionsf\[.\]

Los rolled, his Eyes into two narrow circles, then sent him

Over Jordan; all terrified fled: they became what they beheld.

If Perceptive Organs vary: Objects of Perception seem to vary:

If the Perceptive Organs close: their Objects seem to close also:

Consider this O mortal Man: O worm of sixty winters said Los

Consider Sexual Organization & hide thee in the dust.

PLATE 31 \[35\]

Then the Divine hand found the Two Limits, Satan and Adam,

In Albions bosom: for in every Human bosom those Limits stand.

And the Divine voice came from the Furnaces, as multitudes without

Number: the voices of the innumerable multitudes of Eternity.

And the appearance of a Man was seen in the Furnaces;

Saving those who have sinned from the punishment of the Law,

\(In pity of the punisher whose state is eternal death,\)

And keeping them from Sin by the mild counsels of his love.

Albion goes to Eternal Death: In Me all Eternity,

10  Must pass thro’ condemnation, and awake beyond the Grave:

No individual can keep these Laws, for they are death

To every energy of man, and forbid the springs of life;

Albion hath enterd the State Satan\! Be permanent O State\!

And be thou for ever accursed\! that Albion may arise again:

And be thou created into a State\! I go forth to Create

States: to deliver Individuals evermore\! Amen.

So spoke the voice from the Furnaces, descending into Non-Entity

\[*To Govern the Evil by Good: and States abolish Systems*.\]

PLATE 32 \[36\]

Reuben return’d to his place, in vain he sought beautiful Tirzah

For his Eyelids were narrowd, & his Nostrils scented the ground

And Sixty Winters Los raged in the Divisions of Reuben:

Building the Moon of Ulro, plank by plank & rib by rib

Reuben slept in the Cave of Adam, and Los folded his Tongue

Between Lips of mire & clay, then sent him forth over Jordan

In the love of Tirzah he said Doubt is my food day & night –

All that beheld him fled howling and gnawed their tongues

For pain: they became what they beheld. In reasonings Reuben returned

10  To Heshbon, disconsolate he walkd thro Moab & he stood

Before the Furnaces of Los in a horrible dreamful slumber,

On Mount Gilead looking toward Gilgal: and Los bended

His Ear in a spiral circle outward; then sent him over Jordan.

The Seven Nations fled before him they became what they beheld

Hand, Hyle & Coban fled: they became what they beheld

Gwantock & Peachy hid in Damascus beneath Mount Lebanon

Brereton & Slade in Egypt. Hutton & Skofeld & Kox

Fled over Chaldea in terror in pains in every nerve

Kotope & Bowen became what they beheld, fleeing over the Earth

20  And the Twelve Female Emanations fled with them agonizing.

Jerusalem trembled seeing her Children drivn by Los’s Hammer

In the visions of the dreams of Beulah on the edge of Non-Entity

Hand stood between Reuben & Merlin, as the Reasoning Spectre

Stands between the Vegetative Man & his Immortal Imagination

And the Four Zoa’s clouded rage East & West & North & South

They change their situations, in the Universal Man.

Albion groans, he sees the Elements divide before his face.

And England who is Brittannia divided into Jerusalem & Vala

And Urizen assumes the East, Luvah assumes the South

30  In his dark Spectre ravening from his open Sepulcher

And the Four Zoa’s who are the Four Eternal Senses of Man

Became Four Elements separating from the Limbs of Albion

These are their names in the Vegetative Generation

\[*West Weighing East & North dividing Generation South* \[ \]ing\]

And Accident & Chance were found hidden in Length Bredth & Highth

And they divided into Four ravening deathlike Forms

Fairies & Genii & Nymphs & Gnomes of the Elements.

These are States Permanently Fixed by the Divine Power\[.\]

The Atlantic Continent sunk round Albions cliffy shore

40  And the Sea poured in amain upon the Giants of Albion

As Los bended the Senses of Reuben Reuben is Merlin

Exploring the Three States of Ulro; Creation;

   Redemption, & Judgment

And many of the Eternal Ones laughed after their manner

Have you known the Judgment that is arisen among the

Zoa’s of Albion? where a Man dare hardly to embrace

His own Wife, for the terrors of Chastity that they call

By the name of Morality, their Daughters govern all

In hidden deceit\! they are Vegetable only fit for burning:

Art & Science cannot exist but by Naked Beauty displayd

50  Then those in Great Eternity who contemplate on Death

Said thus. What seems to Be: Is: To those to whom

It seems to Be, & is productive of the most dreadful

Consequences to those to whom it seems to Be: even of

Torments, Despair, Eternal Death; but the Divine Mercy

Steps beyond and Redeems Man in the Body of Jesus Amen

And Length Bredth Highth again Obey the Divine Vision Hallelujah

PLATE 33 \[37\]

And One stood forth from the Divine family & said

I feel my Spectre rising upon me\! Albion\! arouze thyself\!

Why dost thou thunder with frozen Spectrous wrath against us?

The Spectre is, in Giant Man; insane, and most deform’d.

Thou wilt certainly provoke my Spectre against thine in fury\!

He has a Sepulcher hewn out of a Rock ready for thee:

And a Death of Eight thousand years, forg’d by thyself, upon

The point of his Spear\! if thou persistest to forbid with Laws

Our Emanations, and to attack our secret supreme delights

10  So Los spoke: But when he saw blue death in Albions feet,

Again he join’d the Divine Body, following merciful;

While Albion fled more indignant: revengeful covering

PLATE 34 \[38\]

His face and bosom with petrifie hardness, and his hands

And feet, lest any should enter his bosom & embrace

His hidden heart; his Emanation wept & trembled within him:

Uttering not his jealousy, but hiding it as with

Iron and steel, dark and opake, with clouds & tempests brooding:

His strong limbs shudderd upon his mountains high and dark.

Turning from Universal Love petrific as he went,

His cold against the warmth of Eden rag’d with loud

Thunders of deadly war \(the fever of the human soul\)

10  Fires and clouds of rolling smoke\! but mild the Saviour follow’d him,

Displaying the Eternal Vision\! the Divine Similitude\!

In loves and tears of brothers, sisters, sons, fathers, and friends

Which if Man ceases to behold, he ceases to exist:

Saying. Albion\! Our wars are wars of life, & wounds of love,

With intellectual spears, & long winged arrows of thought:

Mutual in one anothers love and wrath all renewing

We live as One Man; for contracting our infinite senses

We behold multitude; or expanding: we behold as one,

As One Man all the Universal Family; and that One Man

20  We call Jesus the Christ: and he in us, and we in him,

Live in perfect harmony in Eden the land of life,

Giving, recieving, and forgiving each others trespasses.

He is the Good shepherd, he is the Lord and master:

He is the Shepherd of Albion, he is all in all,

In Eden: in the garden of God: and in heavenly Jerusalem.

If we have offended, forgive us, take not vengeance against us.

Thus speaking; the Divine Family follow Albion:

I see them in the Vision of God upon my pleasant valleys.

I behold London; a Human awful wonder of God\!

30  He says: Return, Albion, return\! I give myself for thee:

My Streets are my, Ideas of Imagination.

Awake Albion, awake\! and let us awake up together.

My Houses are Thoughts: my Inhabitants: Affections,

The children of my thoughts, walking within my blood-vessels,

Shut from my nervous form which sleeps upon the verge of Beulah

In dreams of darkness, while my vegetating blood in veiny pipes,

Rolls dreadful thro’ the Furnaces of Los, and the Mills of Satan.

For Albions sake, and for Jerusalem thy Emanation

I give myself, and these my brethren give themselves for Albion.

40  So spoke London, immortal Guardian\! I heard in Lambeths shades:

In Felpham I heard and saw the Visions of Albion

I write in South Molton Street, what I both see and hear

In regions of Humanity, in Londons opening streets.

I see thee awful Parent Land in light, behold I see\!

Verulam\! Canterbury\! venerable parent of men,

Generous immortal Guardian golden clad\! for Cities

Are Men, fathers of multitudes, and Rivers & Mountains

Are also Men; every thing is Human, mighty\! sublime\!

In every bosom a Universe expands, as wings

50  Let down at will around, and call’d the Universal Tent.

York, crown’d with loving kindness. Edinburgh, cloth’d

With fortitude as with a garment of immortal texture

Woven in looms of Eden, in spiritual deaths of mighty men

Who give themselves, in Golgotha, Victims to Justice; where

There is in Albion a Gate of Precious stones and gold

Seen only by Emanations, by vegetations viewless,

Bending across the road of Oxford Street; it from Hyde Park

To Tyburns deathful shades, admits the wandering souls

Of multitudes who die from Earth: this Gate cannot be found

PLATE 35 \[39\]

By Satans Watch-fiends tho’ they search numbering every grain

Of sand on Earth every night, they never find this Gate.

It is the Gate of Los. Withoutside is the Mill, intricate, dreadful

And fill’d with cruel tortures; but no mortal man can find the Mill

Of Satan, in his mortal pilgrimage of seventy years

For Human beauty knows it not: nor can Mercy find it\! But

In the Fourth region of Humanity, Urthona namd\[,\]

Mortality begins to roll the billows of Eternal Death

Before the Gate of Los. Urthona here is named Los.

10  And here begins the System of Moral Virtue, named Rahab.

Albion fled thro’ the Gate of Los, and he stood in the Gate.

Los was the friend of Albion who most lov’d him. In Cambridgeshire

His eternal station, he is the twenty-eighth, & is four-fold.

Seeing Albion had turn’d his back against the Divine Vision,

Los said to Albion. Whither fleest thou? Albion reply’d.

I die\! I go to Eternal Death\! the shades of death

Hover within me & beneath, and spreading themselves outside

Like rocky clouds, build me a gloomy monument of woe:

Will none accompany me in my death? or be a Ransom for me

20  In that dark Valley? I have girded round my cloke, and on my feet

Bound these black shoes of death, & on my hands, deaths iron gloves:

God hath forsaken me, & my friends are become a burden

A weariness to me, & the human footstep is a terror to me.

Los answerd, troubled: and his soul was rent in twain:

Must the Wise die for an Atonement? does Mercy endure Atonement?

No\! It is Moral Severity, & destroys Mercy in its Victim.

So speaking, not yet infected with the Error & Illusion,

PLATE 36 \[40\]

Los shudder’d at beholding Albion, for his disease

Arose upon him pale and ghastly: and he call’d around

The Friends of Albion: trembling at the sight of Eternal Death

The four appear’d with their Emanations in fiery

Chariots: black their fires roll beholding Albions House of Eternity

Damp couch the flames beneath and silent, sick, stand shuddering

Before the Porch of sixteen pillars: weeping every one

Descended and fell down upon their knees around Albions knees,

Swearing the Oath of God\! with awful voice of thunders round

10  Upon the hills & valleys, and the cloudy Oath roll’d far and wide

Albion is sick\! said every Valley, every mournful Hill

And every River: our brother Albion is sick to death.

He hath leagued himself with robbers: he hath studied the arts

Of unbelief: Envy hovers over him\! his Friends are his abhorrence\!

Those who give their lives for him are despised\!

Those who devour his soul, are taken into his bosom\!

To destroy his Emanation is their intention:

Arise\! awake O Friends of the Giant Albion

They have perswaded him of horrible falshoods\!

20  They have sown errors over all his fruitful fields\!

The Twenty-four heard\! they came trembling on watry chariots.

Borne by the Living Creatures of the third procession

Of Human Majesty, the Living Creatures wept aloud as they

Went along Albions roads, till they arriv’d at Albions House.

O\! how the torments of Eternal Death, waited on Man:

And the loud-rending bars of the Creation ready to burst:

That the wide world might fly from its hinges & the immortal mansion

Of Man, for ever be possessd by monsters of the deeps:

And Man himself become a Fiend, wrap’d in an endless curse,

30  Consuming and consum’d for-ever in flames of Moral Justice.

For had the Body of Albion fall’n down, and from its dreadful ruins

Let loose the enormous Spectre on the darkness of the deep,

At enmity with the Merciful & fill’d with devouring fire,

A nether-world must have recievd the foul enormous spirit,

Under pretence of Moral Virtue, fill’d with Revenge and Law.

There to eternity chain’d down, and issuing in red flames

And curses, with his mighty arms brandish’d against the heavens

Breathing cruelty blood & vengeance, gnashing his teeth with pain

Torn with black storms, & ceaseless torrents of his own consuming fire:

40  Within his breast his mighty Sons chaind down & fill’d with cursings:

And his dark Eon, that once fair crystal form divinely clear:

Within his ribs producing serpents whose souls are flames of fire.

But, glory to the Merciful-One, for he is of tender mercies\!

And the Divine Family wept over him as One Man.

And these the Twenty-four in whom the Divine Family

Appeard; and they were One in Him. A Human Vision\!

Human Divine, Jesus the Saviour, blessed for ever and ever.

Selsey, true friend\! who afterwards submitted to be devourd

By the waves of Despair, whose Emanation rose above

50  The flood, and was nam’d Chichester, lovely mild & gentle\! Lo\!

Her lambs bleat to the sea-fowls cry, lamenting still for Albion.

Submitting to be call’d the son of Los the terrible vision:

Winchester stood devoting himself for Albion: his tents

Outspread with abundant riches, and his Emanations

Submitting to be call’d Enitharmons daughters, and be born

In vegetable mould: created by the Hammer and Loom

In Bowlahoola & Allamanda where the Dead wail night & day.

\(I call them by their English names: English, the rough basement.

Los built the stubborn structure of the Language, acting against

60  Albions melancholy, who must else have been a Dumb despair.\)



Gloucester and Exeter and Salisbury and Bristol: and benevolent Bath



### **PLATE** 37 \[41\]

Bath who is Legions: he is the Seventh, the physician and

The poisoner: the best and worst in Heaven and Hell:

Whose Spectre first assimilated with Luvah in Albions mountains

A triple octave he took, to reduce Jerusalem to twelve

To cast Jerusalem forth upon the wilds to Poplar & Bow:

To Malden & Canterbury in the delights of cruelty:

The Shuttles of death sing in the sky to Islington & Pancrass

Round Marybone to Tyburns River, weaving black melancholy as a net,

And despair as meshes closely wove over the west of London,

10  Where mild Jerusalem sought to repose in death & be no more.

She fled to Lambeths mild Vale and hid herself beneath

The Surrey Hills where Rephaim terminates: her Sons are siez’d

For victims of sacrifice; but Jerusalem cannot be found\! Hid

By the Daughters of Beulah: gently snatch’d away: and hid in Beulah



There is a Grain of Sand in Lambeth that Satan cannot find

Nor can his Watch Fiends find it: tis translucent & has many Angles

But he who finds it will find Oothoons palace, for within

Opening into Beulah every angle is a lovely heaven

But should the Watch Fiends find it, they would call it Sin

20  And lay its Heavens & their inhabitants in blood of punishment

Here Jerusalem & Vala were hid in soft slumberous repose

Hid from the terrible East, shut up in the South & West.

The Twenty-eight trembled in Deaths dark caves, in cold despair

They kneeld around the Couch of Death in deep humiliation

And tortures of self condemnation while their Spectres ragd within.

The Four Zoa’s in terrible combustion clouded rage

Drinking the shuddering fears & loves of Albions Families

Destroying by selfish affections the things that they most admire

Drinking & eating, & pitying & weeping, as at a trajic scene.

30  The soul drinks murder & revenge, & applauds its own holiness

They saw Albion endeavouring to destroy their Emanations.



### **PLATE** 38 \[43\]

They saw their Wheels rising up poisonous against Albion

Urizen, cold & scientific: Luvah, pitying & weeping

Tharmas, indolent & sullen: Urthona, doubting & despairing

Victims to one another & dreadfully plotting against each other

To prevent Albion walking about in the Four Complexions.

They saw America clos’d out by the Oaks of the western shore;

And Tharmas dash’d on the Rocks of the Altars of Victims in Mexico.

If we are wrathful Albion will destroy Jerusalem with rooty Groves

If we are merciful, ourselves must suffer destruction on his Oaks:

10  Why should we enter into our Spectres, to behold our own corruptions

O God of Albion descend\! deliver Jerusalem from the Oaken Groves\!



Then Los grew furious raging: Why stand we here trembling around

Calling on God for help; and not ourselves in whom God dwells

Stretching a hand to save the falling Man: are we not Four

Beholding Albion upon the Precipice ready to fall into Non-Entity:

Seeing these Heavens & Hells conglobing in the Void. Heavens over Hells

Brooding in holy hypocritic lust, drinking the cries of pain

From howling victims of Law: building Heavens Twenty-seven-fold.

Swelld & bloated General Forms, repugnant to the Divine-

20  Humanity, who is the Only General and Universal Form

To which all Lineaments tend & seek with love & sympathy

All broad & general principles belong to benevolence

Who protects minute particulars, every one in their own identity.

But here the affectionate touch of the tongue is closd in by deadly teeth

And the soft smile of friendship & the open dawn of benevolence

Become a net & a trap, & every energy renderd cruel,

Till the existence of friendship & benevolence is denied:

The wine of the Spirit & the vineyards of the Holy-One,

Here: turn into poisonous stupor & deadly intoxication:

30  That they may be condemnd by Law & the Lamb of God be slain\!

And the two Sources of Life in Eternity\[,\] Hunting and War,

Are become the Sources of dark & bitter Death & of corroding Hell:

The open heart is shut up in integuments of frozen silence

That the spear that lights it forth may shatter the ribs & bosom

A pretence of Art, to destroy Art: a pretence of Liberty

To destroy Liberty, a pretence of Religion to destroy Religion

Oshea and Caleb fight: they contend in the valleys of Peor

In the terrible Family Contentions of those who love each other:

The Armies of Balaam weep – no women come to the field

40  Dead corses lay before them, & not as in Wars of old.

For the Soldier who fights for Truth, calls his enemy his brother:

They fight & contend for life, & not for eternal death\!

But here the Soldier strikes, & a dead corse falls at his feet

Nor Daughter nor Sister nor Mother come forth to embosom the Slain\!

But Death\! Eternal Death\! remains in the Valleys of Peor.

The English are scatterd over the face of the Nations: are these

Jerusalems children? Hark\! hear the Giants of Albion cry at night

We smell the blood of the English\! we delight in their blood on our Altars\!

The living & the dead shall be ground in our rumbling Mills

50  For bread of the Sons of Albion: of the Giants Hand & Scofield

Scofeld & Kox are let loose upon my Saxons\! they accumulate

A World in which Man is by his Nature the Enemy of Man,

In pride of Selfhood unwieldy stretching out into Non Entity

Generalizing Art & Science till Art & Science is lost.

Bristol & Bath, listen to my words, & ye Seventeen: give ear\!

It is easy to acknowledge a man to be great & good while we

Derogate from him in the trifles & small articles of that goodness:

Those alone are his friends, who admire his minutest powers\[.\]

Instead of Albions lovely mountains & the curtains of Jerusalem

60  I see a Cave, a Rock, a Tree deadly and poisonous, unimaginative:

Instead of the Mutual Forgivenesses, the Minute Particulars, I see

Pits of bitumen ever burning: artificial Riches of the Canaanite

Like Lakes of liquid lead: instead of heavenly Chapels, built

By our dear Lord: I see Worlds crusted with snows & ice;

I see a Wicker Idol woven round Jerusalems children. I see

The Canaanite, the Amalekite, the Moabite, the Egyptian:

By Demonstrations the cruel Sons of Quality & Negation.

Driven on the Void in incoherent despair into Non Entity

I see America closd apart, & Jerusalem driven in terror

70  Away from Albions mountains, far away from Londons spires:

I will not endure this thing: I alone withstand to death,

This outrage\! Ah me\! how sick & pale you all stand round me\!

Ah me\! pitiable ones\! do you also go to deaths vale?

All you my Friends & Brothers: all you my beloved Companions:

Have you also caught the infection of Sin & stern Repentance?

I see Disease arise upon you\! yet speak to me and give

Me some comfort: why do you all stand silent? I alone

Remain in permanent strength. Or is all this goodness & pity, only

That you may take the greater vengeance in your Sepulcher.

80  So Los spoke. Pale they stood around the House of Death:

In the midst of temptations & despair: among the rooted Oaks:

Among reared Rocks of Albions Sons, at length they rose

PLATE 39 \[44\]

With one accord in love sublime, & as on Cherubs wings

They Albion surround with kindest violence to bear him back

Against his will thro Los’s Gate to Eden: Four-fold; loud:

Their Wings waving over the bottomless Immense: to bear

Their awful charge back to his native home: but Albion dark,

Repugnant; rolld his Wheels backward into Non-Entity

Loud roll the Starry Wheels of Albion into the World of Death

And all the Gate of Los, clouded with clouds redounding from

Albions dread Wheels, stretching out spaces immense between

10  That every little particle of light & air, became Opake

Black & immense, a Rock of difficulty & a Cliff

Of black despair; that the immortal Wings labourd against

Cliff after cliff, & over Valleys of despair & death:

The narrow Sea between Albion & the Atlantic Continent:

Its waves of pearl became a boundless Ocean bottomless,

Of grey obscurity, filld with clouds & rocks & whirling waters

And Albions Sons ascending & descending in the horrid Void.

But as the Will must not be bended but in the day of Divine

Power: silent calm & motionless, in the mid-air sublime,

20  The Family Divine hover around the darkend Albion.

Such is the nature of the Ulro: that whatever enters:

Becomes Sexual, & is Created, and Vegetated, and Born.

From Hyde Park spread their vegetating roots beneath Albion

In dreadful pain the Spectrous Uncircumcised Vegetation. –

Forming a Sexual Machine: an Aged Virgin Form.

In Erins Land toward the north, joint after joint & burning

In love & jealousy immingled & calling it Religion

And feeling the damps of death they with one accord delegated Los

Conjuring him by the Highest that he should Watch over them

30  Till Jesus shall appear: & they gave their power to Los

Naming him the Spirit of Prophecy, calling him Elijah

Strucken with Albions disease they become what they behold;

They assimilate with Albion in pity & compassion;

Their Emanations return not: their Spectres rage in the Deep

The Slumbers of Death came over them around the Couch of Death

Before the Gate of Los & in the depths of Non Entity

Among the Furnaces of Los: among the Oaks of Albion.

Man is adjoind to Man by his Emanative portion:

Who is Jerusalem in every individual Man: and her

40  Shadow is Vala, builded by the Reasoning power in Man

O search & see: turn your eyes inward: open O thou World

Of Love & Harmony in Man: expand thy ever lovely Gates.

They wept into the deeps a little space at length was heard

The voice of Bath, faint as the voice of the Dead in the House of Death

PLATE 40 \[45\]

Bath, healing City\! whose wisdom in midst of Poetic

Fervor: mild spoke thro’ the Western Porch, in soft gentle tears

O Albion mildest Son of Eden\! clos’d is thy Western Gate

Brothers of Eternity: this Man whose great example

We all admir’d & lov’d, whose all benevolent countenance, seen

In Eden, in lovely Jerusalem, drew even from envy

The tear: and the confession of honesty, open & undisguis’d

From mistrust and suspition. The Man is himself become

A piteous example of oblivion. To teach the Sons

10  Of Eden, that however great and glorious; however loving

And merciful the Individuality; however high

Our palaces and cities, and however fruitful are our fields

In Selfhood, we are nothing: but fade away in mornings breath.

Our mildness is nothing: the greatest mildness we can use

Is incapable and nothing: none but the Lamb of God can heal

This dread disease: none but Jesus: O Lord descend and save:

Albions Western Gate is clos’d: his death is coming apace:

Jesus alone can save him; for alas we none can know

How soon his lot may be our own. When Africa in sleep

20  Rose in the night of Beulah, and bound down the Sun & Moon

His friends cut his strong chains, & overwhelm’d his dark

Machines in fury & destruction, and the Man reviving repented

He wept before his wrathful brethren, thankful & considerate

For their well timed wrath. But Albions sleep is not

Like Africa’s: and his machines are woven with his life

Nothing but mercy can save him\! nothing but mercy interposing

Lest he should slay Jerusalem in his fearful jealousy

O God descend: gather our brethren, deliver Jerusalem\[.\]

But that we may omit no office of the friendly spirit

30  Oxford take thou these leaves of the Tree of Life: with eloquence

That thy immortal tongue inspires; present them to Albion:

Perhaps he may recieve them, offerd from thy loved hands.

So spoke, unhear’d by Albion. the merciful Son of Heaven

To those whose Western Gates were open, as they stood weeping

Around Albion: but Albion heard him not; obdurate\! hard\!

He frown’d on all his Friends, counting them enemies in his sorrow

And the Seventeen conjoining with Bath, the Seventh:

In whom the other Ten shone manifest, a Divine Vision\!

Assimilated and embrac’d Eternal Death for Albions sake.

40  And these the names of the Eighteen combining with those Ten

PLATE 41 \[46\]

Bath, mild Physician of Eternity, mysterious power

Whose springs are unsearchable & knowledge infinite.

Hereford, ancient Guardian of Wales, whose hands

Builded the mountain palaces of Eden, stupendous works\!

Lincoln, Durham & Carlisle, Councellors of Los.

And Ely, Scribe of Los, whose pen no other hand

Dare touch: Oxford, immortal Bard\! with eloquence

Divine, he wept over Albion: speaking the words of God

In mild perswasion: bringing leaves of the Tree of Life.

Thou art in Error Albion, the Land of Ulro:

One Error not remov’d, will destroy a human Soul

Repose in Beulahs night, till the Error is remov’d

Reason not on both sides. Repose upon our bosoms

Till the Plow of Jehovah, and the Harrow of Shaddai

Have passed over the Dead, to awake the Dead to Judgment.

But Albion turn’d away refusing comfort.

Oxford trembled while he spoke, then fainted in the arms

Of Norwich, Peterboro, Rochester, Chester awful, Worcester,

Litchfield, Saint Davids, Landaff, Asaph, Bangor, Sodor,

20  Bowing their heads devoted: and the Furnaces of Los

Began to rage, thundering loud the storms began to roar

Upon the Furnaces, and loud the Furnaces rebellow beneath

And these the Four in whom the twenty-four appear’d four-fold:

Verulam, London, York, Edinburgh, mourning one towards another

Alas\! – The time will come, when a mans worst enemies

Shall be those of his own house and family: in a Religion

Of Generation, to destroy by Sin and Atonement, happy Jerusalem,

The Bride and Wife of the Lamb. O God thou art Not an Avenger\!

PLATE 42

Thus Albion sat, studious of others in his pale disease:

Brooding on evil: but when Los opend the Furnaces before him:

He saw that the accursed things were his own affections,

And his own beloveds: then he turn’d sick: his soul died within him

Also Los sick & terrified beheld the Furnaces of Death

And must have died, but the Divine Saviour descended

Among the infant loves & affections, and the Divine Vision wept

Like evening dew on every herb upon the breathing ground

Albion spoke in his dismal dreams: O thou deceitful friend

10  Worshipping mercy & beholding thy friend in such affliction:

Los\! thou now discoverest thy turpitude to the heavens.

I demand righteousness & justice. O thou ingratitude\!

Give me my Emanations back\[,\] food for my dying soul:

My daughters are harlots\! my sons are accursed before me.

Enitharmon is my daughter: accursed with a fathers curse:

O\! I have utterly been wasted\! I have given my daughters to devils

So spoke Albion in gloomy majesty, and deepest night

Of Ulro rolld round his skirts from Dover to Cornwall.

Los answerd. Righteousness & justice I give thee in return

20  For thy righteousness\! but I add mercy also, and bind

Thee from destroying these little ones: am I to be only

Merciful to thee and cruel to all that thou hatest\[?\]

Thou wast the Image of God surrounded by the Four Zoa’s

Three thou hast slain\! I am the Fourth: thou canst not destroy me.

Thou art in Error; trouble me not with thy righteousness.

I have innocence to defend and ignorance to instruct:

I have no time for seeming; and little arts of compliment,

In morality and virtue: in self-glorying and pride.

There is a limit of Opakeness, and a limit of Contraction;

30  In every Individual Man, and the limit of Opakeness,

Is named Satan: and the limit of Contraction is named Adam.

But when Man sleeps in Beulah, the Saviour in mercy takes

Contractions Limit, and of the Limit he forms Woman: That

Himself may in process of time be born Man to redeem

But there is no Limit of Expansion\! there is no Limit of Translucence,

In the bosom of Man for ever from eternity to eternity.

Therefore I break thy bonds of righteousness; I crush thy messengers\!

That they may not crush me and mine: do thou be righteous,

And I will return it; otherwise I defy thy worst revenge:

40  Consider me as thine enemy: on me turn all thy fury

But destroy not these little ones, nor mock the Lords anointed:

Destroy not by Moral Virtue, the little ones whom he hath chosen:

The little ones whom he hath chosen in preference to thee.

He hath cast thee off for ever; the little ones he hath anointed\!

Thy Selfhood is for ever accursed from the Divine presence

So Los spoke: then turn’d his face & wept for Albion.

Albion replied. Go: Hand & Hyle\! sieze the abhorred \[fiend\]:

As you Have siezd the Twenty-four rebellious ingratitudes;

To atone for you, for spiritual death\! Man lives by deaths of Men

50  Bring him to justice before heaven here upon London stone,

Between Blackheath & Hounslow, between Norwood & Finchley

All that they have is mine: from my free genrous gift,

They now hold all they have: ingratitude to me:

To me their benefactor calls aloud for vengeance deep.

Los stood before his Furnaces awaiting the fury of the Dead:

And the Divine hand was upon him, strengthening him mightily.

The Spectres of the Dead cry out from the deeps beneath

Upon the hills of Albion; Oxford groans in his iron furnace

Winchester in his den & cavern; they lament against

60  Albion: they curse their human kindness & affection

They rage like wild beasts in the forests of affliction

In the dreams of Ulro they repent of their human kindness.

Come up, build Babylon, Rahab is ours & all her multitudes

With her in pomp and glory of victory. Depart

Ye twenty-four into the deeps\! let us depart to glory\!

Their Human majestic forms sit up upon their Couches

Of death: they curb their Spectres as with iron curbs

They enquire after Jerusalem in the regions of the dead,

With the voices of dead men, low, scarcely articulate,

70  And with tears cold on their cheeks they weary repose.

O when shall the morning of the grave appear, and when

Shall our salvation come? we sleep upon our watch

We cannot awake\! and our Spectres rage in the forests

O God of Albion where art thou\! pity the watchers\!

Thus mourn they. Loud the Furnaces of Los thunder upon

The clouds of Europe & Asia, among the Serpent Temples\!

And Los drew his Seven Furnaces around Albions Altars

And as Albion built his frozen Altars, Los built the Mundane Shell,

In the Four Regions of Humanity East & West & North & South,

80  Till Norwood & Finchley & Blackheath & Hounslow, coverd the whole Earth.

This is the Net & Veil of Vala, among the Souls of the Dead.

PLATE 43 \[29\]

Then the Divine Vision like a silent Sun appeard above

Albions dark rocks: setting behind the Gardens of Kensington

On Tyburns River, in clouds of blood: where was mild Zion Hills

Most ancient promontory, and in the Sun, a Human Form appeard

And thus the Voice Divine went forth upon the rocks of Albion

I elected Albion for my glory; I gave to him the Nations,

Of the whole Earth. He was the Angel of my Presence: and all

The Sons of God were Albions Sons: and Jerusalem was my joy.

The Reactor hath hid himself thro envy. I behold him.

10  But you cannot behold him till he be reveald in his System

Albions Reactor must have a Place prepard: Albion must Sleep

The Sleep of Death, till the Man of Sin & Repentance be reveald.

Hidden in Albions Forests he lurks: he admits of no Reply

From Albion: but hath founded his Reaction into a Law

Of Action, for Obedience to destroy the Contraries of Man\[.\]

He hath compelld Albion to become a Punisher & hath possessd

Himself of Albions Forests & Wilds: and Jerusalem is taken\!

The City of the Woods in the Forest of Ephratah is taken\!

London is a stone of her ruins; Oxford is the dust of her walls\!

20  Sussex & Kent are her scatterd garments: Ireland her holy place:

And the murderd bodies of her little ones are Scotland and Wales\[.\]

The Cities of the Nations are the smoke of her consummation

The Nations are her dust: ground by the chariot wheels

Of her lordly conquerors, her palaces levelld with the dust.

I come that I may find a way for my banished ones to return

Fear not O little Flock I come: Albion shall rise again.

So saying, the mild Sun inclosd the Human Family.

Forthwith from Albions darkning \[r\]ocks came two Immortal forms

Saying We alone are escaped. O merciful Lord and Saviour,

30  We flee from the interiors of Albions hills and mountains\!

From his Valleys Eastward: from Amalek Canaan & Moab:

Beneath his vast ranges of hills surrounding Jerusalem.

Albion walkd on the steps of fire before his Halls

And Vala walkd with him in dreams of soft deluding slumber.

He looked up & saw the Prince of Light with splendor faded

Then Albion ascended mourning into the porches of his Palace

Above him rose a Shadow from his wearied intellect:

Of living gold, pure, perfect, holy: in white linen pure he hoverd

A sweet entrancing self-delusion a watry vision of Albion

40  Soft exulting in existence; all the Man absorbing\!

Albion fell upon his face prostrate before the watry Shadow

Saying O Lord whence is this change: thou knowest I am nothing\!

And Vala trembled & coverd her face: & her locks were spread on the pavement

We heard astonishd at the Vision & our hearts trembled within us:

We heard the voice of slumberous Albion, and thus he spake,

Idolatrous to his own Shadow words of eternity uttering:

O I am nothing when I enter into judgment with thee\!

If thou withdraw thy breath I die & vanish into Hades

If thou dost lay thine hand upon me behold I am silent:

50  If thou withhold thine hand; I perish like a fallen leaf:

O I am nothing: and to nothing must return again:

If thou withdraw thy breath, Behold I am oblivion.

He ceasd: the shadowy voice was silent: but the cloud hoverd over their heads

In golden wreathes, the sorrow of Man; & the balmy drops fell down.

And lo\! that son of Man that Shadowy Spirit of mild Albion:

Luvah descended from the cloud; in terror Albion rose:

Indignant rose the awful Man, & turnd his back on Vala.

We heard the voice of Albion starting from his sleep:

Whence is this voice crying Enion\! that soundeth in my ears?

60  O cruel pity\! O dark deceit\! can love seek for dominion?

And Luvah strove to gain dominion over Albion

They strove together above the Body where Vala was inclosd

And the dark Body of Albion left prostrate upon the crystal pavement,

Coverd with boils from head to foot: the terrible smitings of Luvah.

Then frownd the fallen Man and put forth Luvah from his presence

Saying. Go and Die the Death of Man, for Vala the sweet wanderer.

I will turn the volutions of your ears outward, and bend your nostrils

Downward, and your fluxile eyes englob’d roll round in fear:

Your withring lips and tongue shrink up into a narrow circle,

70  Till into narrow forms you creep: go take your fiery way:

And learn what tis to absorb the Man you Spirits of Pity & Love.

They heard the voice and fled swift as the winters setting sun.

And now the human blood foamd high, the Spirits Luvah & Vala

Went down the Human Heart where Paradise & its joys abounded,

In jealous fears & fury & rage, & flames roll round their fervid feet:

And the vast form of Nature like a serpent playd before them

And as they fled in folding fires & thunders of the deep:

Vala shrunk in like the dark sea that leaves its slimy banks.

And from her bosom Luvah fell far as the east and west.

80  And the vast form of Nature like a serpent rolld between,

Whether of Jerusalems or Valas ruins congenerated, we know not:

All is confusion: all is tumult, & we alone are escaped.

So spoke the fugitives; they joind the Divine Family, trembling

PLATE 44 \[30\]

And the Two that escaped; were the Emanation of Los & his

Spectre: for whereever the Emanation goes, the Spectre

Attends her as her Guard, & Los’s Emanation is named

Enitharmon, & his Spectre is named Urthona: they knew

Not where to flee: they had been on a visit to Albions Children

And they strove to weave a Shadow of the Emanation

To hide themselves: weeping & lamenting for the Vegetation

Of Albions Children: fleeing thro Albions vales in streams of gore.

Being not irritated by insult bearing insulting benevolences

10  They percieved that corporeal friends are spiritual enemies

They saw the Sexual Religion in its embryon Uncircumcision

And the Divine hand was upon them bearing them thro darkness

Back safe to their Humanity as doves to their windows:

Therefore the Sons of Eden praise Urthonas Spectre in Songs

Because he kept the Divine Vision in time of trouble.

They wept & trembled: & Los put forth his hand & took them in

Into his Bosom: from which Albion shrunk in dismal pain;

Rending the fibres of Brotherhood & in Feminine Allegories

20  Inclosing Los: but the Divine Vision appeard with Los

Following Albion into his Central Void among his Oaks.

And Los prayed and said. O Divine Saviour arise

Upon the Mountains of Albion as in ancient time. Behold\!

The Cities of Albion seek thy face, London groans in pain

From Hill to Hill & the Thames laments along the Valleys

The little Villages of Middlesex & Surrey hunger & thirst

The Twenty-eight Cities of Albion stretch their hands to thee:

Because of the Opressors of Albion in every City & Village:

They mock at the Labourers limbs\! they mock at his starvd Children\!

They buy his Daughters that they may have power to sell his Sons:

30  They compell the Poor to live upon a crust of bread by soft mild arts:

They reduce the Man to want: then give with pomp & ceremony.

The praise of Jehovah is chaunted from lips of hunger & thirst:

Humanity knows not of Sex: wherefore are Sexes in Beulah?

In Beulah the Female lets down her beautiful Tabernacle;

Which the Male enters magnificent between her Cherubim:

And becomes One with her mingling condensing in Self-love

The Rocky Law of Condemnation & double Generation, & Death.

Albion hath enterd the Loins the place of the Last Judgment:

And Luvah hath drawn the Curtains around Albion in Vala’s bosom

40  The Dead awake to Generation\! Arise O Lord, & rend the Veil\!

So Los in lamentations followd Albion. Albion coverd,

PLATE 45 \[31\]

His western heaven with rocky clouds of death & despair.

Fearing that Albion should turn his back against the Divine Vision

Los took his globe of fire to search the interiors of Albions

Bosom, in all the terrors of friendship, entering the caves

Of despair & death, to search the tempters out, walking among

Albions rocks & precipices\! caves of solitude & dark despair,

And saw every Minute Particular of Albion degraded & murderd

But saw not by whom; they were hidden within in the minute particulars

Of which they had possessd themselves; and there they take up

10  The articulations of a mans soul, and laughing throw it down

Into the frame, then knock it out upon the plank, & souls are bak’d

In bricks to build the pyramids of Heber & Terah. But Los

Searchd in vain: closd from the minutia he walkd, difficult.

He came down from Highgate thro Hackney & Holloway towards London

Till he came to old Stratford & thence to Stepney & the Isle

Of Leuthas Dogs, thence thro the narrows of the Rivers side

And saw every minute particular, the jewels of Albion, running down

The kennels of the streets & lanes as if they were abhorrd.

Every Universal Form, was become barren mountains of Moral

20  Virtue: and every Minute Particular hardend into grains of sand:

And all the tendernesses of the soul cast forth as filth & mire,

Among the winding places of deep contemplation intricate

To where the Tower of London frownd dreadful over Jerusalem:

A building of Luvah builded in Jerusalems eastern gate to be

His secluded Court: thence to Bethlehem where was builded

Dens of despair in the house of bread: enquiring in vain

Of stones and rocks he took his way, for human form was none:

And thus he spoke, looking on Albions City with many tears

What shall I do\! what could I do, if I could find these Criminals

30  I could not dare to take vengeance; for all things are so constructed

And builded by the Divine hand, that the sinner shall always escape,

And he who takes vengeance alone is the criminal of Providence;

If I should dare to lay my finger on a grain of sand

In way of vengeance; I punish the already punishd: O whom

Should I pity if I pity not the sinner who is gone astray\!

O Albion, if thou takest vengeance; if thou revengest thy wrongs

Thou art for ever lost\! What can I do to hinder the Sons

Of Albion from taking vengeance? or how shall I them perswade.

So spoke Los, travelling thro darkness & horrid solitude:

40  And he beheld Jerusalem in Westminster & Marybone,

Among the ruins of the Temple: and Vala who is her Shadow,

Jerusalems Shadow bent northward over the Island white.

At length he sat on London Stone, & heard Jerusalems voice.

Albion I cannot be thy Wife, thine own Minute Particulars,

Belong to God alone, and all thy little ones are holy

They are of Faith & not of Demonstration: wherefore is Vala

Clothd in black mourning upon my rivers currents, Vala awake\!

I hear thy shuttles sing in the sky, and round my limbs

I feel the iron threads of love & jealousy & despair.

50  Vala replyd. Albion is mine: Luvah gave me to Albion

And now recieves reproach & hate. Was it not said of old

Set your Son before a man & he shall take you & your sons

For slaves: but set your Daughter before a man & She

Shall make him & his sons & daughters your slaves for ever:

And is this Faith? Behold the strife of Albion & Luvah

Is great in the east, their spears of blood rage in the eastern heaven

Urizen is the champion of Albion, they will slay my Luvah:

And thou O harlot daughter\! daughter of despair art all

This cause of these shakings of my towers on Euphrates.

60  Here is the House of Albion, & here is thy secluded place

And here we have found thy sins: & hence we turn thee forth,

For all to avoid thee: to be astonishd at thee for thy sins:

Because thou art the impurity & the harlot: & thy children:

Children of whoredoms: born for Sacrifice: for the meat & drink

Offering: to sustain the glorious combat & the battle & war

That Man may be purified by the death of thy delusions.

So saying she her dark threads cast over the trembling River:

And over the valleys; from the hills of Hertfordshire to the hills

Of Surrey across Middlesex. & across Albions House

70  Of Eternity\! pale stood Albion at his eastern gate,

PLATE 46 \[32\]

Leaning against the pillars, & his disease rose from his skirts

Upon the Precipice he stood: ready to fall into Non-Entity.

Los was all astonishment & terror: he trembled sitting on the Stone

Of London: but the interiors of Albions fibres & nerves were hidden

From Los; astonishd he beheld only the petrified surfaces:

And saw his Furnaces in ruins, for Los is the Demon of the Furnaces;

He saw also the Four Points of Albion reversd inwards

He siezd his Hammer & Tongs, his iron Poker & his Bellows,

Upon the valleys of Middlesex, Shouting loud for aid Divine.

10  In stern defiance came from Albions bosom Hand, Hyle, Koban,

Gwantok, Peachy, Brertun, Slaid, Huttn, Skofeld, Kock, Kotope

Bowen: Albions Sons: they bore him a golden couch into the porch

And on the Couch reposd his limbs, trembling from the bloody field.

Rearing their Druid Patriarchal rocky Temples around his limbs.

\(All things begin & end, in Albions Ancient Druid Rocky Shore.\)

PLATE 47

\[*When Albion utterd his last words Hope is banishd from me*\]

From Camberwell to Highgate where the mighty Thames shudders along,

Where Los’s Furnaces stand, where Jerusalem & Vala howl:

Luvah tore forth from Albions Loins, in fibrous veins, in rivers

Of blood over Europe: a Vegetating Root in grinding pain.

Animating the Dragon Temples, soon to become that Holy Fiend

The Wicker Man of Scandinavia in which cruelly consumed

The Captives reard to heaven howl in flames among the stars

Loud the cries of War on the Rhine & Danube, with Albions Sons,

10  Away from Beulahs hills & vales break forth the Souls of the Dead,

With cymbal, trumpet, clarion; & the scythed chariots of Britain.

And the Veil of Vala, is composed of the Spectres of the Dead

Hark\! the mingling cries of Luvah with the Sons of Albion

Hark\! & Record the terrible wonder\! that the Punisher

Mingles with his Victims Spectre, enslaved and tormented

To him whom he has murderd, bound in vengeance & enmity

Shudder not, but Write, & the hand of God will assist you\!

Therefore I write Albions last words. Hope is banish’d from me.

PLATE 48

These were his last words, and the merciful Saviour in his arms

Reciev’d him, in the arms of tender mercy and repos’d

The pale limbs of his Eternal Individuality

Upon the Rock of Ages. Then, surrounded with a Cloud:

In silence the Divine Lord builded with immortal labour,

Of gold & jewels a sublime Ornament, a Couch of repose,

With Sixteen pillars: canopied with emblems & written verse.

Spiritual Verse, order’d & measur’d, from whence, time shall reveal.

The Five books of the Decalogue, the books of Joshua & Judges,

10  Samuel, a double book & Kings, a double book, the Psalms & Prophets

The Four-fold Gospel, and the Revelations everlasting

Eternity groan’d & was troubled, at the image of Eternal Death\!

Beneath the bottoms of the Graves, which is Earths central joint,

There is a place where Contrarieties are equally true:

\(To protect from the Giant blows in the sports of intellect,

Thunder in the midst of kindness, & love that kills its beloved:

Because Death is for a period, and they renew tenfold.\)

From this sweet Place Maternal Love awoke Jerusalem

With pangs she forsook Beulahs pleasant lovely shadowy Universe

20  Where no dispute can come; created for those who Sleep.

Weeping was in all Beulah, and all the Daughters of Beulah

Wept for their Sister the Daughter of Albion, Jerusalem:

When out of Beulah the Emanation of the Sleeper descended

With solemn mourning out of Beulahs moony shades and hills:

Within the Human Heart, whose Gates closed with solemn sound.

And this the manner of the terrible Separation

The Emanations of the grievously afflicted Friends of Albion

Concenter in one Female form an Aged pensive Woman.

Astonish’d\! lovely\! embracing the sublime shade: the Daughters of Beulah

30  Beheld her with wonder\! With awful hands she took

A Moment of Time, drawing it out with many tears & afflictions

And many sorrows: oblique across the Atlantic Vale

Which is the Vale of Rephaim dreadful from East to West,

Where the Human Harvest waves abundant in the beams of Eden

Into a Rainbow of jewels and gold, a mild Reflection from

Albions dread Tomb. Eight thousand and five hundred years

In its extension. Every two hundred years has a door to Eden

She also took an Atom of Space, with dire pain opening it a Center

Into Beulah: trembling the Daughters of Beulah dried

40  Her tears, she ardent embrac’d her sorrows, occupied in labours

Of sublime mercy in Rephaims Vale. Perusing Albions Tomb

She sat: she walk’d among the ornaments solemn mourning.

The Daughters attended her shudderings, wiping the death sweat

Los also saw her in his seventh Furnace, he also terrified

Saw the finger of God go forth upon his seventh Furnace:

Away from the Starry Wheels to prepare Jerusalem a place.

When with a dreadful groan the Emanation mild of Albion

Burst from his bosom in the Tomb like a pale snowy cloud,

Female and lovely, struggling to put off the Human form

50  Writhing in pain. The Daughters of Beulah in kind arms reciev’d

Jerusalem: weeping over her among the Spaces of Erin,

In the Ends of Beulah, where the Dead wail night & day.



And thus Erin spoke to the Daughters of Beulah, in soft tears



Albion the Vortex of the Dead\! Albion the Generous\!

Albion the mildest son of Heaven\! The Place of Holy Sacrifice\!

Where Friends Die for each other: will become the Place,

Of Murder, & Unforgiving, Never-awaking Sacrifice of Enemies\[.\]

The Children must be sacrific’d\! \(a horror never known

Till now in Beulah.\) unless a Refuge can be found

60  To hide them from the wrath of Albions Law that freezes sore

Upon his Sons & Daughters, self-exiled from his bosom

Draw ye Jerusalem away from Albions Mountains

To give a Place for Redemption, let Sihon and Og

Remove Eastward to Bashan and Gilead, and leave

PLATE 49

The secret coverts of Albion & the hidden places of America

Jerusalem Jerusalem\! why wilt thou turn away

Come ye O Daughters of Beulah, lament for Og & Sihon

Upon the Lakes of Ireland from Rathlin to Baltimore:

Stand ye upon the Dargle from Wicklow to Drogheda

Come & mourn over Albion the White Cliff of the Atlantic

The Mountain of Giants: all the Giants of Albion are become

Weak: witherd: darkend: & Jerusalem is cast forth from Albion.

They deny that they ever knew Jerusalem, or ever dwelt in Shiloh\[.\]

10  The Gigantic roots & twigs of the vegetating Sons of Albion

Filld with the little-ones are consumed in the Fires of their Altars

The vegetating Cities are burned & consumed from the Earth:

And the Bodies in which all Animals & Vegetations, the Earth & Heaven

Were containd in the All Glorious Imagination are witherd & darkend:

The golden Gate of Havilah, and all the Garden of God,

Was caught up with the Sun in one day of fury and war:

The Lungs, the Heart, the Liver, shrunk away far distant from Man

And left a little slimy substance floating upon the tides.

In one night the Atlantic Continent was caught up with the Moon,

20  And became an Opake Globe far distant clad with moony beams.

The Visions of Eternity, by reason of narrowed perceptions,

Are become weak Visions of Time & Space, fix’d into furrows of death;

Till deep dissimulation is the only defence an honest man has left\[.\]

O Polypus of Death O Spectre over Europe and Asia

Withering the Human Form by Laws of Sacrifice for Sin

By Laws of Chastity & Abhorrence I am witherd up.

Striving to Create a Heaven in which all shall be pure & holy

In their Own Selfhoods, in Natural Selfish Chastity to banish Pity

And dear Mutual Forgiveness; & to become One Great Satan

30  Inslavd to the most powerful Selfhood: to murder the Divine Humanity

In whose sight all are as the dust & who chargeth his Angels with folly\!

Ah: weak & wide astray: Ah shut in narrow doleful form\!

Creeping in reptile flesh upon the bosom of the ground:

The Eye of Man, a little narrow orb, closd up & dark,

Scarcely beholding the Great Light; conversing with the ground

The Ear, a little shell, in small volutions shutting out

True Harmonies, & comprehending great, as very small:

The Nostrils, bent down to the earth & clos’d with senseless flesh,

That odours cannot them expand, nor joy on them exult:

40  The Tongue, a little moisture fills, a little food it cloys,

A little sound it utters, & its cries are faintly heard.

Therefore they are removed: therefore they have taken root

In Egypt & Philistea: in Moab & Edom & Aram:

In the Erythrean Sea their Uncircu\[m\]cision in Heart & Loins

Be lost for ever & ever, then they shall arise from Self

By Self Annihilation into Jerusalems Courts & into Shiloh

Shiloh the Masculine Emanation among the Flowers of Beulah

Lo Shiloh dwells over France, as Jerusalem dwells over Albion

Build & prepare a Wall & Curtain for Americas shore\!

Rush on: Rush on\! Rush on\! ye vegetating Sons of Albion   50

The Sun shall go before you in Day: the Moon shall go

Before you in Night. Come on\! Come on\! Come on\! The Lord

Jehovah is before, behind, above, beneath, around

He has builded the arches of Albions Tomb binding the Stars



In merciful Order, bending the Laws of Cruelty to Peace.

He hath placed Og & Anak, the Giants of Albion for their Guards:

Building the Body of Moses in the Valley of Peor: the Body

Of Divine Analogy; and Og & Sihon in the tears of Balaam

The Son of Beor, have given their power to Joshua & Caleb.

60  Remove from Albion, far remove these terrible surfaces.

They are beginning to form Heavens & Hells in immense

Circles: the Hells for food to the Heavens: food of torment,

Food of despair: they drink the condemnd Soul & rejoice

In cruel holiness, in their Heavens of Chastity & Uncircumcision

Yet they are blameless & Iniquity must be imputed only

To the State they are enterd into that they may be deliverd:

Satan is the State of Death, & not a Human existence:

But Luvah is named Satan, because he has enterd that State.

A World where Man is by Nature the enemy of Man

70  Because the Evil is Created into a State, that Men

May be deliverd time after time evermore. Amen.

Learn therefore O Sisters to distinguish the Eternal Human

That walks about among the stones of fire in bliss & woe

Alternate\! from those States or Worlds in which the Spirit travels:

This is the only means to Forgiveness of Enemies

Therefore remove from Albion these terrible Surfaces

And let wild seas & rocks close up Jerusalem away from

PLATE 50

The Atlantic Mountains where Giants dwelt in Intellect;

Now given to stony Druids, and Allegoric Generation

To the Twelve Gods of Asia, the Spectres of those who Sleep:

Sway’d by a Providence oppos’d to the Divine Lord Jesus:

A murderous Providence\! A Creation that groans, living on Death.

Where Fish & Bird & Beast & Man & Tree & Metal & Stone

Live by Devouring, going into Eternal Death continually:

Albion is now possess’d by the War of Blood\! the Sacrifice

Of envy Albion is become, and his Emanation cast out:

10  Come Lord Jesus, Lamb of God descend\! for if; O Lord\!

If thou hadst been here, our brother Albion had not died.

Arise sisters\! Go ye & meet the Lord, while I remain –

Behold the foggy mornings of the Dead on Albions cliffs:

Ye know that if the Emanation remains in them:

She will become an Eternal Death, an Avenger of Sin

A Self-righteousness: the proud Virgin-Harlot\! Mother of War\!

And we also & all Beulah, consume beneath Albions curse.

So Erin spoke to the Daughters of Beulah. Shuddering

With their wings they sat in the Furnace, in a night

20  Of stars, for all the Sons of Albion appeard distant stars,

Ascending and descending into Albions sea of death.

And Erins lovely Bow enclos’d the Wheels of Albions Sons.

Expanding on wing, the Daughters of Beulah replied in sweet response

Come O thou Lamb of God and take away the remembrance of Sin

To Sin & to hide the Sin in sweet deceit. is lovely\!\!

To Sin in the open face of day is cruel & pitiless\! But

To record the Sin for a reproach: to let the Sun go down

In a remembrance of the Sin: is a Woe & a Horror\!

A brooder of an Evil Day, and a Sun rising in blood

30  Come then O Lamb of God and take away the remembrance of Sin

End of Chap. 2d.

PLATE 52

          ![Image](images/000004.jpg)

    He never can be a Friend to the Human Race who is the Preacher of Natural Morality or Natural Religion. he is a flatterer who means to betray, to perpetuate Tyrant Pride & the Laws of that Babylon which he forsees shall shortly be destroyed, with the Spiritual and not the Natural Sword: He is in the State named Rahab: which State must be put off before he can be the Friend of Man.

    You O Deists profess yourselves the Enemies of Christianity: and you are so: you are also the Enemies of the

10 Human Race & of Universal Nature. Man is born a

Spectre or Satan & is altogether an Evil, & requires a New Selfhood continually & must continually be changed into his direct Contrary. But your Greek Philosophy \(which is a remnant of Druidism\) teaches that Man is Righteous in his Vegetated Spectre: an Opinion of fatal & accursed consequence to Man, as the Ancients saw plainly by Revelation to the intire abrogation of Experimental Theory. and many believed what they saw, and Prophecied of Jesus.

    Man must & will have Some Religion; if he has not the

20  Religion of Jesus, he will have the Religion of Satan, & will

erect the Synagogue of Satan. calling the Prince of this World, God; and destroying all who do not worship Satan under the Name of God. Will any one say: Where are those who worship Satan under the Name of God\! Where are they? Listen\! Every Religion that Preaches Vengeance for Sin is the Religion of the Enemy & Avenger; and not of the Forgiver of Sin, and their God is Satan, Named by the Divine Name. Your Religion O Deists: Deism, is the Worship of the God of this World by the

30  means of what you call Natural Religion and Natural

Philosophy, and of Natural Morality or Self-Righteousness, the Selfish Virtues of the Natural Heart. This was the Religion of the Pharisees who murderd Jesus. Deism is the same & ends in the same.

Voltaire Rousseau Gibbon Hume, charge the Spiritually Religious with hypocrisy\! but how a Monk or a Methodist either, can be a Hypocrite: I cannot concieve. We are Men of like passions with others & pretend not to be holier than others: therefore, when a Religious Man falls into

40  Sin, he ought not to be calld a Hypocrite: this title is more

properly to be given to a Player who falls into Sin; whose profession is Virtue & Morality & the making Men Self-Righteous. Foote in calling Whitefield, Hypocrite: was himself one: for Whitefield pretended not to be holier than others: but confessed his Sins before all the World; Voltaire\! Rousseau\! You cannot escape my charge that you are Pharisees & Hypocrites, for you are constantly talking of the Virtues of the Human Heart, and particularly of your own, that you may accuse others & especially the Religious,

50  whose errors, you by this display of pretended Virtue,

chiefly design to expose. Rousseau thought Men Good by Nature; he found them Evil & found no friend. Friendship cannot exist without Forgiveness of Sins continually. The Book written by Rousseau calld his Confessions is an apology & cloke for his sin & not a confession.

But you also charge the poor Monks & Religious with being the causes of War: while you acquit & flatter the Alexanders & Caesars, the Lewis’s & Fredericks: who alone are its causes & its actors. But the Religion of Jesus,

60  Forgiveness of Sin, can never be the cause of a War nor of  
      a single Martyrdom.

Those who Martyr others or who cause War are Deists, but never can be Forgivers of Sin. The Glory of Christianity is, To Conquer by Forgiveness. All the Destruction therefore, in Christian Europe has arisen from Deism, which is Natural Religion.

I saw a Monk of Charlemaine

Arise before my sight

I talkd with the Grey Monk as we stood

In beams of infernal light

Gibbon arose with a lash of steel

And Voltaire with a wracking wheel

The Schools in clouds of learning rolld

Arose with War in iron & gold.

Thou lazy Monk they sound afar

10  In vain condemning glorious War

And in your Cell you shall ever dwell

Rise War & bind him in his Cell.

The blood, red ran from the Grey Monks side

His hands & feet were wounded wide

His body bent, his arms & knees

Like to the roots of ancient trees

When Satan first the black bow bent

And the Moral Law from the Gospel rent

He forgd the Law into a Sword

20  And spilld the blood of mercys Lord.

Titus\! Constantine\! Charlemaine\!

O Voltaire\! Rousseau\! Gibbon\! Vain

Your Grecian Mocks & Roman Sword

Against this image of his Lord\!

For a Tear is an Intellectual thing;

And a Sigh is the Sword of an Angel King

And the bitter groan of a Martyrs woe

Is an Arrow from the Almighties Bow.

PLATE 53

JERUSALEM

CHAP 3

But Los, who is the Vehicular Form of strong Urthona

Wept vehemently over Albion where Thames currents spring

From the rivers of Beulah; pleasant river\! soft, mild, parent stream

And the roots of Albions Tree enterd the Soul of Los

As he sat before his Furnaces clothed in sackcloth of hair

In gnawing pain dividing him from his Emanation;

Inclosing all the children of Los time after time.

Their Giant forms condensing into Nations & Peoples & Tongues

Translucent the Furnaces, of Beryll & Emerald immortal:

10  And Seven-fold each within other: incomprehensible

To the Vegetated Mortal Eye’s perverted & single vision

The Bellows are the Animal Lungs. the Hammers, the Animal Heart

The Furnaces, the Stomach for Digestion; terrible their fury

Like seven burning heavens rang’d from South to North

Here on the banks of the Thames, Los builded Golgonooza,

Outside of the Gates of the Human Heart, beneath Beulah

In the midst of the rocks of the Altars of Albion. In fears

He builded it, in rage & in fury. It is the Spiritual Fourfold

London: continually building & continually decaying desolate:

20  In eternal labours: loud the Furnaces & loud the Anvils

Of Death thunder incessant around the flaming Couches of

The Twentyfour Friends of Albion and round the awful Four

For the protection of the Twelve Emanations of Albions Sons

The Mystic Union of the Emanation in the Lord; Because

Man divided from his Emanation is a dark Spectre

His Emanation is an ever-weeping melancholy Shadow

But she is made receptive of Generation thro’ mercy

In the Potters Furnace, among the Funeral Urns of Beulah

From Surrey hills, thro’ Italy and Greece, to Hinnoms vale.

PLATE 54

In Great Eternity, every particular Form gives forth or Emanates

Its own peculiar Light, & the Form is the Divine Vision

And the Light is his Garment. This is Jerusalem in every Man

A Tent & Tabernacle of Mutual Forgiveness Male & Female Clothings.

And Jerusalem is called Liberty among the Children of Albion

But Albion fell down a Rocky fragment from: Eternity hurld

By his own Spectre, who is the Reasoning Power in every Man

Into his own Chaos which is the Memory between Man & Man

The silent broodings of deadly revenge springing from the

10  All powerful parental affection, fills Albion from head to foot

Seeing his Sons assimilate with Luvah, bound in the bonds

Of spiritual Hate, from which springs Sexual Love as iron chains:

He tosses like a cloud outstretchd among Jerusalems Ruins

Which overspread all the Earth, he groans among his ruind porches

But the Spectre like a hoar frost & a Mildew rose over Albion

Saying, I am God O Sons of Men\! I am your Rational Power\!

Am I not Bacon & Newton & Locke who teach Humility to Man\!

Who teach Doubt & Experiment & my two Wings Voltaire: Rousseau.

Where is that Friend of Sinners\! that Rebel against my Laws\!

20  Who teaches Belief to the Nations, & an unknown Eternal Life

Come hither into the Desart & turn these stones to bread.

Vain foolish Man\! wilt thou believe without Experiment?

And build a World of Phantasy upon my Great Abyss\!

A World of Shapes in craving lust & devouring appetite

So spoke the hard cold constrictive Spectre he is named Arthur

Constricting into Druid Rocks round Canaan Agag & Aram & Pharoh

Then Albion drew England into his bosom in groans & tears

But she stretchd out her starry Night in Spaces against him, like

A long Serpent, in the Abyss of the Spectre which augmented

30  The Night with Dragon wings coverd with stars & in the Wings

Jerusalem & Vala appeard: & above between the Wings magnificent

The Divine Vision dimly appeard in clouds of blood weeping.

PLATE 55

When those who disregard all Mortal Things, saw a Mighty-One

Among the Flowers of Beulah still retain his awful strength

They wonderd: checking their wild flames & Many gathering

Together into an Assembly; they said, let us go down

And see these changes\! Others said, If you do so prepare

For being driven from our fields, what have we to do with the Dead?

To be their inferiors or superiors we equally abhor;

Superior, none we know: inferior none: all equal share

Divine Benevolence & joy, for the Eternal Man

10  Walketh among us, calling us his Brothers & his Friends:

Forbidding us that Veil which Satan puts between Eve & Adam

By which the Princes of the Dead enslave their Votaries

Teaching them to form the Serpent of precious stones & gold

To sieze the Sons of Jerusalem & plant them in One Mans Loins

To make One Family on Contraries: that Joseph may be sold

Into Egypt: for Negation; a Veil the Saviour born & dying rends.

But others said: Let us to him who only Is, & who

Walketh among us, give decision, bring forth all your fires\!

So saying, an eternal deed was done: in fiery flames

20  The Universal Conc\[l\]ave raged, such thunderous sounds as never

Were sounded from a mortal cloud, nor on Mount Sinai old

Nor in Havilah where the Cherub rolld his redounding flame.

Loud\! loud\! the Mountains lifted up their voices, loud the Forests

Rivers thunderd against their banks, loud Winds furious fought

Cities & Nations contended in fires & clouds & tempests.

The Seas raisd up their voices & lifted their hands on high

The Stars in their courses fought, the Sun\! Moon\! Heaven: Earth.

Contending for Albion & for Jerusalem his Emanation

And for Shiloh, the Emanation of France & for lovely Vala.

30  Then far the greatest number were about to make a Separation

And they Elected Seven, calld the Seven Eyes of God;

Lucifer, Molech, Elohim, Shaddai, Pahad, Jehovah, Jesus.

They namd the Eighth, he came not, he hid in Albions Forests

But first they said: \(& their Words stood in Chariots in array

Curbing their Tygers with golden bits & bridles of silver & ivory\)

Let the Human Organs be kept in their perfect Integrity

At will Contracting into Worms, or Expanding into Gods

And then behold\! what are these Ulro Visions of Chastity\[?\]

Then as the moss upon the tree: or dust upon the plow:

40  Or as the sweat upon the labouring shoulder: or as the chaff

Of the wheat-floor or as the dregs of the sweet wine-press

Such are these Ulro Visions, for tho we sit down within

The plowed furrow, listning to the weeping clods till we

Contract or Expand Space at will: or if we raise ourselves

Upon the chariots of the morning, Contracting or Expanding Time:

Every one knows, we are One Family: One Man blessed for ever

Silence remaind & every one resumd his Human Majesty

And many conversed on these things as they labourd at the furrow

Saying: It is better to prevent misery, than to release from misery

50  It is better to prevent error, than to forgive the criminal:

Labour well the Minute Particulars, attend to the Little-ones:

And those who are in misery cannot remain so long

If we do but our duty: labour well the teeming Earth.

They Plow’d in tears, the trumpets sounded before the golden Plow

And the voices of the Living Creatures were heard in the clouds of heaven

Crying: Compell the Reasoner to Demonstrate with unhewn Demonstrations

Let the Indefinite be explored, and let every Man be Judged

By his own Works. Let all Indefinites be thrown into Demonstrations

To be pounded to dust & melted in the Furnaces of Affliction:

60  He who would do good to another, must do it in Minute Particulars

General Good is the plea of the scoundrel hypocrite & flatterer:

For Art & Science cannot exist but in minutely organized Particulars

And not in generalizing Demonstrations of the Rational Power.

The Infinite alone resides in Definite & Determinate Identity

Establishment of Truth depends on destruction of Falshood continually

On Circumcision: not on Virginity, O Reasoners of Albion

So cried they at the Plow. Albions Rock frowned above

And the Great Voice of Eternity rolled above terrible in clouds

Saying Who will go forth for us\! & Who shall we send before our face?

PLATE 56

Then Los heaved his thund’ring Bellows on the Valley of Middlesex

And thus he chaunted his Song: the Daughters of Albion reply.

What may Man be? who can tell\! But what may Woman be?

To have power over Man from Cradle to corruptible Grave.

He who is an Infant, and whose Cradle is a Manger

Knoweth the Infant sorrow: whence it came, and where it goeth:

And who weave it a Cradle of the grass that withereth away.

This World is all a Cradle for the erred wandering Phantom:

Rock’d by Year, Month, Day & Hour; and every two Moments

10  Between, dwells a Daughter of Beulah, to feed the Human Vegetable

Entune: Daughters of Albion, your hymning Chorus mildly\!

Cord of affection thrilling extatic on the iron Reel:

To the golden Loom of Love\! to the moth-labourd Woof

A Garment and Cradle weaving for the infantine Terror:

For fear; at entering the gate into our World of cruel

Lamentation: it flee back & hide in Non-Entitys dark wild

Where dwells the Spectre of Albion: destroyer of Definite Form.

The Sun shall be a Scythed Chariot of Britain: the Moon: a Ship

In the British Ocean\! Created by Los’s Hammer; measured out

20  Into Days & Nights & Years & Months, to travel with my feet

Over these desolate rocks of Albion: O daughters of despair:

Rock the Cradle, and in mild melodies tell me where found

What you have enwoven with so much tears & care? so much

Tender artifice: to laugh: to weep: to learn: to know;

Remember\! recollect\! what dark befel in wintry days

O it was lost for ever\! and we found it not: it came

And wept at our wintry Door: Look\! look\! behold\! Gwendolen

Is become a Clod of Clay\! Merlin is a Worm of the Valley\!

Then Los uttered with Hammer & Anvil: Chaunt\! revoice\!

30  I mind not your laugh: and your frown I not fear\! and

You must my dictate obey from your gold-beam’d Looms; trill

Gentle to Albions Watchman, on Albions mountains; reeccho

And rock the Cradle while\! Ah me\! Of that Eternal Man

And of the cradled Infancy in his bowels of compassion:

Who fell beneath his instruments of husbandry & became

Subservient to the clods of the furrow\! the cattle and even

The emmet and earth-Worm are his superiors & his lords.

Then the response came warbling from trilling Looms in Albion

We Women tremble at the light therefore: hiding fearful

40  The Divine Vision with Curtain & Veil & fleshly Tabernacle

Los utter’d: swift as the rattling thunder upon the mountains

Look back into the Church Paul\! Look\! Three Women around

The Cross\! O Albion why didst thou a Female Will Create?

PLATE 57

And the voices of Bath & Canterbury & York & Edinburgh, Cry

Over the Plow of Nations in the strong hand of Albion thundering along

Among the Fires of the Druid & the deep black rethundering Waters

Of the Atlantic which poured in impetuous loud loud, louder & louder.

And the Great Voice of the Atlantic howled over the Druid Altars:

Weeping over his Children in Stone-henge in Malden & Colchester.

Round the Rocky Peak of Derbyshire London Stone & Rosamonds Bower

What is a Wife & what is a Harlot? What is a Church & What

Is a Theatre? are they Two & not One? can they Exist Separate?

10  Are not Religion & Politics the Same Thing? Brotherhood is Religion

O Demonstrations of Reason Dividing Families in Cruelty & Pride\!

But Albion fled from the Divine Vision, with the Plow of Nations enflaming

The Living Creatures maddend and Albion fell into the Furrow, and

The Plow went over him & the Living was Plowed in among the Dead

But his Spectre rose over the starry Plow. Albion fled beneath the Plow

Till he came to the Rock of Ages. & he took his Seat upon the Rock.

Wonder siezd all in Eternity\! to behold the Divine Vision, open

The Center into an Expanse, & the Center rolled out into an Expanse.

PLATE 58

In beauty the Daughters of Albion divide & unite at will

Naked & drunk with blood Gwendolen dancing to the timbrel

Of War: reeling up the Street of London she divides in twain

Among the Inhabitants of Albion, the People fall around\[.\]

The Daughters of Albion, divide & unite in jealousy & cruelty

The Inhabitants of Albion at the Harvest & the Vintage

Feel their Brain cut round beneath the temples shrieking

Bonifying into a Scull, the Marrow exuding in dismal pain.

They flee over the rocks bonifying: Horses: Oxen: feel the knife.

10  And while the Sons of Albion by severe War & Judgment, bonify\[,\]

The Hermaphroditic Condensations are divided by the Knife

The obdurate Forms are cut asunder by Jealousy & Pity.

Rational Philosophy and Mathematic Demonstration

Is divided in the intoxications of pleasure & affection

Two Contraries War against each other in fury & blood,

And Los fixes them on his Anvil, incessant his blows:

He fixes them with strong blows. placing the stones & timbers.

To Create a World of Generation from the World of Death:

Dividing the Masculine & Feminine: for the comingling

20  Of Albions & Luvahs Spectres was Hermaphroditic

Urizen wrathful strode above directing the awful Building:

As a Mighty Temple; delivering Form out of confusion

Jordan sprang beneath its threshold bubbling from beneath

Its pillars: Euphrates ran under its arches: white sails

And silver oars reflect on its pillars, & sound on its ecchoing

Pavements: where walk the Sons of Jerusalem who remain Ungenerate

But the revolving Sun and Moon pass thro its porticoes,

Day & night, in sublime majesty & silence they revolve

And shine glorious within: Hand & Koban archd over the Sun

30  In the hot noon, as he traveld thro his journey: Hyle & Skofield

Archd over the Moon at midnight & Los Fixd them there,

With his thunderous Hammer; terrified the Spectres rage & flee

Canaan is his portico; Jordan is a fountain in his porch;

A fountain of milk & wine to relieve the traveller:

Egypt is the eight steps within, Ethiopia supports his pillars;

Lybia & the Lands unknown, are the ascent without;

Within is Asia & Greece, ornamented with exquisite art:

Persia & Media are his halls: his inmost hall is Great Tartary.

China & India & Siberia are his temples for entertainment

40  Poland & Russia & Sweden, his soft retired chambers

France & Spain & Italy & Denmark & Holland & Germany

Are the temples among his pillars. Britain is Los’s Forge;

America North & South are his baths of living waters.

Such is the Ancient World of Urizen in the Satanic Void

Created from the Valley of Middlesex by Londons River

From Stone-henge and from London Stone, from Cornwall to Cathnes

The Four Zoa’s rush around on all sides in dire ruin

Furious in pride of Selfhood the terrible Spectres of Albion

Rear their dark Rocks among the Stars of God: stupendous

50  Works\! A World of Generation continually Creating; out of

The Hermaphroditic Satanic World of rocky destiny.

PLATE 59

And formed into Four precious stones, for enterance from Beulah

For the Veil of Vala which Albion cast into the Atlantic Deep

To catch the Souls of the Dead: began to Vegetate & Petrify

Around the Earth of Albion, among the Roots of his Tree

This Los formed into the Gates & mighty Wall, between the Oak

Of Weeping & the Palm of Suffering beneath Albions Tomb.

Thus in process of time it became the beautiful Mundane Shell,

The Habitation of the Spectres of the Dead & the Place

Of Redemption & of awaking again into Eternity

10  For Four Universes round the Mundane Egg remain Chaotic

One to the North; Urthona: One to the South; Urizen:

One to the East: Luvah: One to the West, Tharmas;

They are the Four Zoas that stood around the Throne Divine.

Verulam: London: York & Edinburgh: their English names

But when Luvah assumed the World of Urizen Southward

And Albion was slain upon his Mountains & in his Tent,

All fell towards the Center, sinking downwards in dire ruin,

In the South remains a burning Fire: in the East, a Void

In the West, a World of raging Waters: in the North; solid Darkness

20  Unfathomable without end: but in the midst of these

Is Built eternally the sublime Universe of Los & Enitharmon

And in the North Gate, in the West of the North, toward Beulah

Cathedrons Looms are builded. and Los’s Furnaces in the South\[.\]

A wondrous golden Building immense with ornaments sublime

Is bright Cathedrons golden Hall, its Courts Towers & Pinnacles

And one Daughter of Los sat at the fiery Reel & another

Sat at the shining Loom with her Sisters attending round

Terrible their distress & their sorrow cannot be utterd

And another Daughter of Los sat at the Spinning Wheel

30  Endless their labour, with bitter food, void of sleep,

Tho hungry they labour: they rouze themselves anxious

Hour after hour labouring at the whirling Wheel

Many Wheels & as many lovely Daughters sit weeping

Yet the intoxicating delight that they take in their work

Obliterates every other evil; none pities their tears

Yet they regard not pity & they expect no one to pity

For they labour for life & love, regardless of any one

But the poor Spectres that they work for, always incessantly

They are mockd, by every one that passes by, they regard not

40  They labour; & when their Wheels are broken by scorn & malice

They mend them sorrowing with many tears & afflictions.

Other Daughters Weave on the Cushion & Pillow, Network fine

That Rahab & Tirzah may exist & live & breathe & love

Ah, that it could be as the Daughters of Beulah wish\!

Other Daughters of Los, labouring at Looms less fine

Create the Silk-worm & the Spider & the Catterpiller

To assist in their most grievous work of pity & compassion

And others Create the wooly Lamb & the downy Fowl

To assist in the work: the Lamb bleats: the Sea-fowl cries

50  Men understand not the distress & the labour & sorrow

That in the Interior Worlds is carried on in fear & trembling

Weaving the shuddring fears & loves of Albions Families

Thunderous rage the Spindles of iron, & the iron Distaff

Maddens in the fury of their hands, weaving in bitter tears

The Veil of Goats-hair & Purple & Scarlet & fine twined Linen

PLATE 60

The clouds of Albions Druid Temples rage in the eastern heaven

While Los sat terrified beholding Albions Spectre who is Luvah

Spreading in bloody veins in torments over Europe & Asia;

Not yet formed but a wretched torment unformed & abyssal

In flaming fire; within the Furnaces the Divine Vision appeard

On Albions hills: often walking from the Furnaces in clouds

And flames among the Druid Temples & the Starry Wheels

Gatherd Jerusalems Children in his arms & bore them like

A Shepherd in the night of Albion which overspread all the Earth

10  I gave thee liberty and life O lovely Jerusalem

And thou hast bound me down upon the Stems of Vegetation

I gave thee Sheep-walks upon the Spanish Mountains Jerusalem

I gave thee Priams City and the Isles of Grecia lovely\!

I gave thee Hand & Scofield & the Counties of Albion:

They spread forth like a lovely root into the Garden of God:

They were as Adam before me: united into One Man,

They stood in innocence & their skiey tent reachd over Asia

To Nimrods Tower to Ham & Canaan walking with Mizraim

Upon the Egyptian Nile, with solemn songs to Grecia

20  And sweet Hesperia even to Great Chaldea & Tesshina

Following thee as a Shepherd by the Four Rivers of Eden

Why wilt thou rend thyself apart, Jerusalem?

And build this Babylon & sacrifice in secret Groves,

Among the Gods of Asia: among the fountains of pitch & nitre

Therefore thy Mountains are become barren Jerusalem\!

Thy Valleys, Plains of burning sand, thy Rivers: waters of death

Thy Villages die of the Famine and thy Cities

Beg bread from house to house, lovely Jerusalem

Why wilt thou deface thy beauty & the beauty of thy little-ones

30  To please thy Idols, in the pretended chastities of Uncircumcision\[?\]

Thy Sons are lovelier than Egypt or Assyria; wherefore

Dost thou blacken their beauty by a Secluded place of rest,

And a peculiar Tabernacle, to cut the integuments of beauty

Into veils of tears and sorrows O lovely Jerusalem\!

They have perswaded thee to this, therefore their end shall come

And I will lead thee thro the Wilderness in shadow of my cloud

And in my love I will lead thee, lovely Shadow of Sleeping Albion.

This is the Song of the Lamb, sung by Slaves in evening time.

But Jerusalem faintly saw him, closd in the Dungeons of Babylon

40  Her Form was held by Beulahs Daughters, but all within unseen

She sat at the Mills, her hair unbound her feet naked

Cut with the flints: her tears run down, her reason grows like

The Wheel of Hand, incessant turning day & night without rest

Insane she raves upon the winds hoarse, inarticulate:

All night Vala hears, she triumphs in pride of holiness

To see Jerusalem deface her lineaments with bitter blows

Of despair, while the Satanic Holiness triumphd in Vala

In a Religion of Chastity & Uncircumcised Selfishness

Both of the Head & Heart & Loins, closd up in Moral Pride.

50  But the Divine Lamb stood beside Jerusalem, oft she saw

The lineaments Divine & oft the Voice heard, & oft she said:

O Lord & Saviour, have the Gods of the Heathen pierced thee?

Or hast thou been pierced in the House of thy Friends?

Art thou alive\! & livest thou for-evermore? or art thou

Not: but a delusive shadow, a thought that liveth not.

Babel mocks saying, there is no God nor Son of God

That thou O Human Imagination, O Divine Body art all

A delusion. but I know thee O Lord when thou arisest upon

My weary eyes even in this dungeon & this iron mill.

60  The Stars of Albion cruel rise; thou bindest to sweet influences:

For thou also sufferest with me altho I behold thee not:

And altho I sin & blaspheme thy holy name, thou pitiest me:

Because thou knowest I am deluded by the turning mills,

And by these visions of pity & love because of Albions death.

Thus spake Jerusalem, & thus the Divine Voice replied.

Mild Shade of Man, pitiest thou these Visions of terror & woe\!

Give forth thy pity & love, fear not\! lo I am with thee always.

Only believe in me that I have power to raise from death

Thy Brother who Sleepeth in Albion: fear not trembling Shade

PLATE 61

Behold: in the Visions of Elohim Jehovah, behold Joseph & Mary

And be comforted O Jerusalem in the Visions of Jehovah Elohim

She looked & saw Joseph the Carpenter in Nazareth & Mary

His espoused Wife. And Mary said, If thou put me away from thee

Dost thou not murder me? Joseph spoke in anger & fury. Should I

Marry a Harlot & an Adulteress? Mary answerd. Art thou more pure

Than thy Maker who forgiveth Sins & calls again Her that is Lost

Tho She hates, he calls her again in love. I love my dear Joseph

But he driveth me away from his presence, yet I hear the voice of God

10  In the voice of my Husband, tho he is angry for a moment, he will not

Utterly cast me away, if I were pure, never could I taste the sweets

Of the Forgive\[ne\]ss of Sins: if I were holy: I never could behold the tears

Of love\! of him who loves me in the midst of his anger in furnace of fire.

Ah my Mary: said Joseph: weeping over & embracing her closely in

His arms: Doth he forgive Jerusalem & not exact Purity from her who is

Polluted. I heard his voice in my sleep & his Angel in my dream:

Saying, Doth Jehovah Forgive a Debt only on condition that it shall

Be Payed? Doth he Forgive Pollution only on conditions of Purity

That Debt is not Forgiven\! That Pollution is not Forgiven

20  Such is the Forgiveness of the Gods, the Moral Virtues of the

Heathen, whose tender Mercies are Cruelty. But Jehovahs Salvation

Is without Money & without Price, in the Continual Forgiveness of Sins

In the Perpetual Mutual Sacrifice in Great Eternity\! for behold\!

There is none that liveth & Sinneth not\! And this is the Covenant

Of Jehovah: If you Forgive one-another, so shall Jehovah Forgive You:

That He Himself may Dwell among You. Fear not then to take

To thee Mary thy Wife, for she is with Child by the Holy Ghost

Then Mary burst forth into a Song\! she flowed like a River of

Many Streams in the arms of Joseph & gave forth her tears of joy

30  Like many waters, and Emanating into gardens & palaces upon

Euphrates & to forests & floods & animals wild & tame from

Gihon to Hiddekel, & to corn fields & villages & inhabitants

Upon Pison & Arnon & Jordan. And I heard the voice among

The Reapers Saying, Am I Jerusalem the lost Adulteress? or am I

Babylon come up to Jerusalem? And another voice answerd Saying

Does the voice of my Lord call me again? am I pure thro his Mercy

And Pity. Am I become lovely as a Virgin in his sight who am

Indeed a Harlot drunken with the Sacrifice of Idols does he

Call her pure as he did in the days of her Infancy when She

40  Was cast out to the loathing of her person. The Chaldean took

Me from my Cradle. The Amalekite stole me away upon his Camels

Before I had ever beheld with love the Face of Jehovah: or known

That there was a God of Mercy: O Mercy O Divine Humanity\!

O Forgiveness & Pity & Compassion\! If I were Pure I should never

Have known Thee; If I were Unpolluted I should never have

Glorified thy Holiness, or rejoiced in thy great Salvation.

Mary leaned her side against Jerusalem. Jerusalem recieved

The Infant into her hands in the Visions of Jehovah. Times passed on

Jerusalem fainted over the Cross & Sepulcher She heard the voice

50  Wilt thou make Rome thy Patriarch Druid & the Kings of Europe his

Horsemen? Man in the Resurrection changes his Sexual Garments at will

Every Harlot was once a Virgin: every Criminal an Infant Love:

PLATE 62

Repose on me till the morning of the Grave. I am thy life.

Jerusalem replied. I am an outcast: Albion is dead\!

I am left to the trampling foot & the spurning heel\!

A Harlot I am calld. I am sold from street to street\!

I am defaced with blows & with the dirt of the Prison\!

And wilt thou become my Husband O my Lord & Saviour?

Shall Vala bring thee forth\! shall the Chaste be ashamed also?

I see the Maternal Line, I behold the Seed of the Woman\!

Cainah, & Ada & Zillah & Naamah Wife of Noah.

10  Shuahs daughter & Tamar & Rahab the Canaanites:

Ruth the Moabite & Bathsheba of the daughters of Heth  
Naamah the Ammonite, Zibeah the Philistine, & Mary  
These are the Daughters of Vala, Mother of the Body of death

But I thy Magdalen behold thy Spiritual Risen Body

Shall Albion arise? I know he shall arise at the Last Day\!

I know that in my flesh I shall see God: but Emanations

Are weak. they know not whence they are, nor whither tend.

Jesus replied. I am the Resurrection & the Life.

I Die & pass the limits of possibility, as it appears

20  To individual perception. Luvah must be Created

And Vala; for I cannot leave them in the gnawing Grave.

But will prepare a way for my banished-ones to return

Come now with me into the villages, walk thro all the cities.

Tho thou art taken to prison & judgment, starved in the streets

I will command the cloud to give thee food & the hard rock

To flow with milk & wine, tho thou seest me not a season

Even a long season & a hard journey & a howling wilderness:

Tho Valas cloud hide thee & Luvahs fires follow thee:

Only believe & trust in me, Lo. I am always with thee:

30  So spoke the Lamb of God while Luvahs Cloud reddening above

Burst forth in streams of blood upon the heavens & dark night

Involvd Jerusalem, & the Wheels of Albions Sons turnd hoarse

Over the Mountains & the fires blaz’d on Druid Altars

And the Sun set in Tyburns Brook where Victims howl & cry.

But Los beheld the Divine Vision among the flames of the Furnaces

Therefore he lived & breathed in hope. but his tears fell incessant

Because his Children were closd from him apart: & Enitharmon

Dividing in fierce pain: also the Vision of God was closd in clouds

Of Albions Spectres, that Los in despair oft sat, & often ponderd

40  On Death Eternal in fierce shudders upon the mountains of Albion

Walking: & in the vales in howlings fierce, then to his Anvils

Turning, anew began his labours, tho in terrible pains:

PLATE 63

Jehovah stood among the Druids in the Valley of Annandale

When the Four Zoas of Albion, the Four Living Creatures, the Cherubim

Of Albion tremble before the Spectre, in the starry Harness of the Plow

Of Nations. And their Names are Urizen & Luvah & Tharmas & Urthona

Luvah slew Tharmas the Angel of the Tongue & Albion brought him

To Justice in his own City of Paris, denying the Resurrection

Then Vala the Wife of Albion, who is the Daughter of Luvah

Took vengeance Twelve-fold among the Chaotic Rocks of the Druids

Where the Human Victims howl to the Moon & Thor & Friga

10  Dance the dance of death contending with Jehovah among the Cherubim.

The Chariot Wheels filled with Eyes rage along the howling Valley

In the Dividing of Reuben & Benjamin bleeding from Chesters River

The Giants & the Witches & the Ghosts of Albion dance with

Thor & Friga, & the Fairies lead the Moon along the Valley of Cherubim

Bleeding in torrents from Mountain to Mountain, a lovely Victim

And Jehovah stood in the Gates of the Victim, & he appeared

A weeping Infant in the Gates of Birth in the midst of Heaven

The Cities & Villages of Albion became Rock & Sand Unhumanized

The Druid Sons of Albion & the Heavens a Void around unfathomable

20  No Human Form but Sexual & a little weeping Infant pale reflected

Multitudinous in the Looking Glass of Enitharmon, on all sides

Around in the clouds of the Female, on Albions Cliflfs of the Dead

Such the appearance in Cheviot: in the Divisions of Reuben

When the Cherubim hid their heads under their wings in deep slumbers

When the Druids demanded Chastity from Woman & all was lost.

How can the Female be Chaste O thou stupid Druid Cried Los

Without the Forgiveness of Sins in the merciful clouds Of Jehovah

And without the Baptism of Repentance to wash away Calumnies, and

The Accusations of Sin that each may be Pure in their Neighbours sight

30  O when shall Jehovah give us Victims from his Flocks & Herds

Instead of Human Victims by the Daughters of Albion &Canaan

Then laugh’d Gwendolen & her laughter shook the Nations & Familys of

The Dead beneath Beulah from Tyburn to Golgotha, and from

Ireland to Japan, furious her Lions & Tygers & Wolves sport before

Los on the Thames & Medway, London & Canterbury groan in pain

Los knew not yet what was done: he thought it was all in Vision

In Visions of the Dreams of Beulah among the Daughters of Albion

Therefore the Murder was put apart in the Looking-Glass of Enitharmon

He saw in Vala’s hand the Druid Knife of Revenge & the Poison Cup

40  Of Jealousy, and thought it a Poetic Vision of the Atmospheres

Till Canaan rolld apart from Albion across the Rhine: along the Danube

And all the Land of Canaan suspended over the Valley of Cheviot

From Bashan to Tyre & from Troy to Gaza of the Amalekite

And Reuben fled with his head downwards among the Caverns

PLATE 64

Of the Mundane Shell which froze on all sides round Canaan on

The vast Expanse: where the Daughters of Albion Weave the Web

Of Ages & Generations, folding & unfolding it, like a Veil of Cherubim

And sometimes it touches the Earths summits, & sometimes spreads

Abroad into the Indefinite Spectre, who is the Rational Power.

Then All the Daughters of Albion became One before Los: even Vala\!

And she put forth her hand upon the Looms in dreadful howlings

Till she vegetated into a hungry Stomach & a devouring Tongue.

Her Hand is a Court of Justice, her Feet: two Armies in Battle

10  Storms & Pestilence: in her Locks: & in her Loins Earthquake,

And Fire, & the Ruin of Cities & Nations & Families & Tongues

She cries: The Human is but a Worm, & thou O Male: Thou art

Thyself Female, a Male: a breeder of Seed: a Son & Husband: & Lo,

The Human Divine is Womans Shadow, a Vapor in the summers heat

Go assume Papal dignity thou Spectre, thou Male Harlot: Arthur

Divide into the Kings of Europe in times remote O Woman-born

And Woman-nourishd & Woman-educated & Woman-scorn’d:

Wherefore art thou living? said Los, & Man cannot live in thy presence

Art thou Vala the Wife of Albion O thou lovely Daughter of Luvah

20  All Quarrels arise from Reasoning, the secret Murder, and

The violent Man-slaughter, these are the Spectres double Cave

The Sexual Death living on accusation of Sin & Judgment

To freeze Love & Innocence into the gold & silver of the Merchant

Without Forgiveness of Sin Love is Itself Eternal Death.

Then the Spectre drew Vala into his bosom magnificent terrific

Glittering with precious stones & gold, with Garments of blood & fire\[.\]

He wept in deadly wrath of the Spectre, in self-contradicting agony

Crimson with Wrath & green with Jealousy dazling with Love

And Jealousy immingled & the purple of the violet darkend deep

30  Over the Plow of Nations thundring in the hand of Albions Spectre

A dark Hermaphrodite they stood frowning upon Londons River

And the Distaff & Spindle in the hands of Vala with the Flax of

Human Miseries turnd fierce with the Lives of Men along the Valley

As Reuben fled before the Daughters of Albion Taxing the Nations

Derby Peak yawnd a horrid Chasm at the Cries of Gwendolen, & at

The stamping feet of Ragan upon the flaming Treddles of her Loom

That drop with crimson gore with the Loves of Albion & Canaan

Opening along the Valley of Rephaim, weaving over the Caves of Machpelah

PLATE 65

To decide Two Worlds with a great decision: a World of Mercy, and

A World of Justice: the World of Mercy for Salvation

To cast Luvah into the Wrath, and Albion into the Pity

In the Two Contraries of Humanity & in the Four Regions.

For in the depths of Albions bosom in the eastern heaven,

They sound the clarions strong\! they chain the howling Captives:

They cast the lots into the helmet: they give the oath of blood in Lambeth

They vote the death of Luvah, & they naild him to Albions Tree in Bath:

They staind him with poisonous blue, they inwove him in cruel roots

10  To die a death of Six thousand years bound round with vegetation

The sun was black & the moon rolld a useless globe thro Britain\!

Then left the Sons of Urizen the plow & harrow, the loom

The hammer & the chisel, & the rule & compasses; from London fleeing

They forg’d the sword on Cheviot, the chariot of war & the battle-ax,

The trumpet fitted to mortal battle, & the flute of summer in Annandale

And all the Arts of Life. they changd into the Arts of Death in Albion.

The hour-glass contemnd because its simple workmanship,

Was like the workmanship of the plowman, & the water wheel,

That raises water into cisterns: broken & burnd with fire:

20  Because its workmanship, was like the workmanship of the shepherd.

And in their stead, intricate wheels invented, wheel without wheel:

To perplex youth in their outgoings, & to bind to labours in Albion.

Of day & night the myriads of eternity that they may grind

And polish brass & iron hour after hour laborious task:

Kept ignorant of its use, that they might spend the days of wisdom

In sorrowful drudgery, to obtain a scanty pittance of bread:

In ignorance to view a small portion & think that All,

And call it Demonstration: blind to all the simple rules of life.

Now: now the battle rages round thy tender limbs O Vala,

30  Now smile among thy bitter tears: now put on all thy beauty

Is not the wound of the sword sweet\! & the broken bone delightful?

Wilt thou now smile among the scythes when the wounded groan in the field\[?\]

We were carried away in thousands from London; & in tens

Of thousands from Westminster & Marybone in ships closd up:

Chaind hand & foot, competid to fight under the iron whips

Of our captains; fearing our officers more than the enemy.

Lift up thy blue eyes Vala & put on thy sapphire shoes:

O melancholy Magdalen behold the morning over Maiden break;

Gird on thy flaming zone, descend into the sepulcher of Canterbury.

40  Scatter the blood from thy golden brow, the tears from thy silver locks:

Shake off the waters from thy wings\! & the dust from thy white garments

Remember all thy feigned terrors on the secret couch of Lambeths Vale

When the sun rose in glowing morn, with arms of mighty hosts

Marching to battle who was wont to rise with Urizens harps

Girt as a sower with his seed to scatter life abroad over Albion:

Arise O Vala\! bring the bow of Urizen: bring the swift arrows of light.

How rag’d the golden horses of Urizen, compelld to the chariot of love\!

Compelld to leave the plow to the ox, to snuff up the winds of desolation

To trample the corn fields in boastful neighings: this is no gentle harp

50  This is no warbling brook, nor shadow of a mirtle tree:

But blood and wounds and dismal cries, and shadows of the oak:

And hearts laid open to the light, by the broad grizly sword:

And bowels hid in hammerd steel rip’d quivering on the ground.

Call forth thy smiles of soft deceit: call forth thy cloudy tears:

We hear thy sighs in trumpets shrill when morn shall blood renew.

So sang the Spectre Sons of Albion round Luvahs Stone of Trial:

Mocking and deriding at the writhings of their Victim on Salisbury:

Drinking his Emanation in intoxicating bliss rejoicing in Giant dance;

For a Spectre has no Emanation but what he imbibes from decieving

60  A Victim\! Then he becomes her Priest & she his Tabernacle,

And his Oak Grove, till the Victim rend the woven Veil,

In the end of his sleep when Jesus calls him from his grave

Howling the Victims on the Druid Altars yield their souls

To the stern Warriors: lovely sport the Daughters round their Victims;

Drinking their lives in sweet intoxication; hence arose from Bath

Soft deluding odours, in spiral volutions intricately winding

Over Albions mountains, a feminine indefinite cruel delusion.

Astonishd: terrified & in pain & torment, Sudden they behold

Their own Parent the Emanation of their murderd Enemy

70  Become their Emanation and their Temple and

Tabernacle They knew not, this Vala was their beloved Mother Vala Albions Wife.

Terrified at the sight of the Victim: at his distorted sinews\!

The tremblings of Vala vibrate thro’ the limbs of Albions Sons:

While they rejoice over Luvah in mockery & bitter scorn:

Sudden they become like what they behold in howlings & deadly pain.

Spasms smite their features, sinews & limbs: pale they look on one another.

They turn, contorted: their iron necks bend unwilling towards

Luvah: their lips tremble: their muscular fibres are crampd & smitten

They become like what they behold\! Yet immense in strength & power,

PLATE 66

In awful pomp & gold, in all the precious unhewn stones of Eden

They build a stupendous Building on the Plain of Salisbury; with chains

Of rocks round London Stone: of Reasonings: of unhewn Demonstrations

In labyrinthine arches, \(Mighty Urizen the Architect,\) thro which

The Heavens might revolve & Eternity be bound in their chain.

Labour unparallelld\! a wondrous rocky World of cruel destiny

Rocks piled on rocks reaching the stars: stretching from pole to pole.

The Building is Natural Religion & its Altars Natural Morality

A building of eternal death: whose proportions are eternal despair

10  Here Vala stood turning the iron Spindle of destruction

From heaven to earth: howling\! invisible\! but not invisible

Her Two Covering Cherubs afterwards named Voltaire & Rousseau:

Two frowning Rocks: on each side of the Cove & Stone of Torture:

Frozen Sons of the feminine Tabernacle of Bacon, Newton & Locke.

For Luvah is France: the Victim of the Spectres of Albion.

Los beheld in terror: he pour’d his loud storms on the Furnaces:

The Daughters of Albion clothed in garments of needle work

Strip them off from their shoulders: and bosoms, they lay aside

20  Their garments; they sit naked upon the Stone of trial.

The Knife of flint passes over the howling Victim: his blood

Gushes & stains the fair side of the fair Daug\[h\]ters of Albion.

They put aside his curls; they divide his seven locks upon

His forehead: they bind his forehead with thorns of iron

They put into his hand a reed, they mock: Saying: Behold

The King of Canaan whose are seven hundred chariots of iron\!

They take off his vesture whole with their Knives of flint:

But they cut asunder his inner garments: searching with

Their cruel fingers for his heart, & there they enter in pomp,

In many tears; & there they erect a temple & an altar:

30  They pour cold water on his brain in front, to cause

Lids to grow over his eyes in veils of tears: and caverns

To freeze over his nostrils, while they feed his tongue from cups

And dishes of painted clay. Glowing with beauty & cruelty:

They obscure the sun & the moon; no eye can look upon them.

Ah\! alas\! at the sight of the Victim, & at sight of those who are smitten,

All who see, become what they behold, their eyes are coverd

With veils of tears and their nostrils & tongues shrunk up

Their ear bent outwards, as their Victim, so are they in pangs

Of unconquerable fear\! amidst delights of revenge Earth-shaking\!

And as their eye & ear shrunk, the heavens shrunk away

The Divine Vision became First a burning flame, then a column

Of fire, then an awful fiery wheel surrounding earth & heaven:

And then a globe of blood wandering distant in an unknown night:

Afar into the unknown night the mountains fled away:

Six months of mortality; a summer: & six months of mortality; a winter:

The Human form began to be alterd by the Daughters of Albion

And the perceptions to be dissipated into the Indefinite. Becoming

A mighty Polypus nam’d Albions Tree: they tie the Veins

And Nerves into two knots: & the Seed into a double knot:

50  They look forth: the Sun is shrunk: the Heavens are shrunk

Away into the far remote: and the Trees & Mountains witherd

Into indefinite cloudy shadows in darkness & separation.

By Invisible Hatreds adjoind, they seem remote and separate

From each other; and yet are a Mighty Polypus in the Deep\!

As the Mistletoe grows on the Oak, so Albions Tree on Eternity: Lo\!

He who will not comingle in Love, must be adjoind by Hate

They look forth from Stone-henge\! from the Cove round London Stone

They look on one another: the mountain calls out to the mountain:

Plinlimmon shrunk away: Snowdon trembled: the mountains

60  Of Wales & Scotland beheld the descending War: the routed flying:

Red run the streams of Albion: Thames is drunk with blood:

As Gwendolen cast the shuttle of war: as Cambel returnd the beam.

The Humber & the Severn: are drunk with the blood of the slain:

London feels his brain cut round: Edinburghs heart is circumscribed\!

York & Lincoln hide among the flocks, because of the griding Knife.

Worcester & Hereford: Oxford & Cambridge reel &stagger,

Overwearied with howling: Wales & Scotland alone sustain the fight\!

The inhabitants are sick to death: they labour to divide into Days

And Nights, the uncertain Periods; and into Weeks & Months. In vain

70  They send the Dove & Raven: & in vain the Serpent over the mountains.

And in vain the Eagle & Lion over the four-fold wilderness.

They return not: but generate in rocky places desolate.

They return not: but build a habitation separate from Man.

The Sun forgets his course like a drunken man; he hesitates,

Upon the Cheselden hills, thinking to sleep on the Severn

In vain: he is hurried afar into an unknown Night

He bleeds in torrents of blood as he rolls thro heaven above

He chokes up the paths of the sky; the Moon is leprous as snow:

Trembling & descending down seeking to rest upon high Mona:

Scattering her leprous snows in flakes of disease over Albion.

The Stars flee remote: the heaven is iron, the earth is sulphur,

And all the mountains & hills shrink up like a withering gourd,

As the Senses of Men shrink together under the Knife of flint,

In the hands of Albions Daughters, among the Druid Temples,

PLATE 67

By those who drink their blood & the blood of their Covenant

And the Twelve Daughters of Albion united in Rahab & Tirzah

A Double Female: and they drew out from the Rocky Stones

Fibres of Life to Weave for every Female is a Golden Loom

The Rocks are opake hardnesses covering all Vegetated things.

And as they Wove & Cut from the Looms in various divisions

Stretching over Europe & Asia from Ireland to Japan

They divided into many lovely Daughters to be counterparts

To those they Wove, for when they Wove a Male, they divided

10  Into a Female to the Woven Male, in opake hardness

They cut the Fibres from the Rocks groaning in pain they Weave;

Calling the Rocks Atomic Origins of Existence; denying Eternity

By the Atheistical Epicurean Philosophy of Albions Tree

Such are the Feminine & Masculine when separated from Man

They call the Rocks Parents of Men, & adore the frowning Chaos

Dancing around in howling pain clothed in the bloody Veil.

Hiding Albions Sons within the Veil, closing Jerusalems

Sons without; to feed with their Souls the Spectres of Albion

Ashamed to give Love openly to the piteous & merciful Man

20  Counting him an imbecile mockery: but the Warrior

They adore: & his revenge cherish with the blood of the Innocent

They drink up Dan & Gad, to feed with milk Skofeld & Kotope

They strip off Josephs Coat & dip it in the blood of battle

Tirzah sits weeping to hear the shrieks of the dying: her Knife

Of flint is in her hand: she passes it over the howling Victim\[.\]

The Daughters Weave their Work in loud cries over the Rock

Of Horeb\! still eyeing Albions Cliffs eagerly siezing & twisting

The threads of Vala & Jerusalem running from mountain to mountain

Over the whole Earth: loud the Warriors rage in Beth Peor

30  Beneath the iron whips of their Captains & consecrated banners

Loud the Sun & Moon rage in the conflict: loud the Stars

Shout in the night of battle & their spears grow to their hands

With blood, weaving the deaths of the Mighty into a Tabernacle

For Rahab & Tirzah; till the Great Polypus of Generation covered the Earth.

In Verulam the Polypus’s Head, winding around his bulk

Thro Rochester, and Chichester, & Exeter & Salisbury,

To Bristol: & his Heart beat strong on Salisbury Plain

Shooting out Fibres round the Earth, thro Gaul & Italy

And Greece, & along the Sea of Rephaim into Judea

40  To Sodom & Gomorrha: thence to India, China &Japan

The Twelve Daughters in Rahab & Tirzah have circumscribd the Brain

Beneath & pierced it thro the midst with a golden pin.

Blood hath staind her fair side beneath her bosom.

O thou poor Human Form\! said she. O thou poor child of woe\!

Why wilt thou wander away from Tirzah: why me compel to bind thee?

If thou dost go away from me I shall consume upon these Rocks\[.\]

These fibres of thine eyes that used to beam in distant heavens

Away from me: I have bound down with a hot iron.

These nostrils that expanded with delight in morning skies

50  I have bent downward with lead melted in my roaring furnaces

Of affliction; of love; of sweet despair; of torment unendurable

My soul is seven furnaces, incessant roars the bellows

Upon my terribly flaming heart, the molten metal runs

In channels thro my fiery limbs: O love\! O pity\! O fear\!

O pain\! O the pangs, the bitter pangs of love forsaken

Ephraim was a wilderness of joy where all my wild beasts ran

The River Kanah wanderd by my sweet Manassehs side

To see the boy spring into heavens sounding from my sight\!

Go Noah fetch the girdle of strong brass, heat it red-hot:

60  Press it around the loins of this ever expanding cruelty

Shriek not so my only love\! I refuse thy joys: I drink

Thy shrieks because Hand & Hyle are cruel & obdurate to me

PLATE 68

O Skofield why art thou cruel? Lo Joseph is thine\! to make

You One: to weave you both in the same mantle of skin

Bind him down Sisters bind him down on Ebal, Mount of cuising:

Malah come forth from Lebanon: & Hoglah from Mount Sinai:

Come circumscribe this tongue of sweets & with a screw of iron

Fasten this ear into the rock: Milcah the task is thine

Weep not so Sisters: weep not so: our life depends on this

Or mercy & truth are fled away from Shechem & Mount Gilead

Unless my beloved is bound upon the Stems of Vegetation

10  And thus the Warriors cry, in the hot day of Victory, in Songs.

Look: the beautiful Daughter of Albion sits naked upon the Stone

Her panting Victim beside her: her heart is drunk with blood

Tho her brain is not drunk with wine: she goes forth from Albion

In pride of beauty: in cruelty of holiness: in the brightness

Of her tabernacle, & her ark & secret place, the beautiful Daughter

Of Albion, delights the eyes of the Kings. their hearts & the

Hearts of their Warriors glow hot before Thor & Friga. O Molech\!

O Chemosh\! O Bacchus\! O Venus\! O Double God of Generation

The Heavens are cut like a mantle around from the Cliffs of Albion

20  Across Europe; across Africa; in howlings & deadly War

A sheet & veil & curtain of blood is let down from Heaven

Across the hills of Ephraim & down Mount Olivet to

The Valley of the Jebusite: Molech rejoices in heaven

He sees the Twelve Daughters naked upon the Twelve Stones

Themselves condensing to rocks & into the Ribs of a Man

Lo they shoot forth in tender Nerves across Europe & Asia

Lo they rest upon the Tribes, where their panting Victims lie\[.\]

Molech rushes into the Kings in love to the beautiful Daughters

But they frown & delight in cruelty, refusing all other joy

30  Bring your Offerings, your first begotten: pamperd with milk & blood

Your first born of seven years old: be they Males or Females:

To the beautiful Daughters of Albion\! they sport before the Kings

Clothed in the skin of the Victim: blood: human blood: is the life

And delightful food of the Warrior: the well fed Warriors flesh

Of him who is slain in War: fills the Valleys of Ephraim with

Breeding Women walking in pride & bringing forth under green trees

With pleasure, without pain, for their food is, blood of the Captive

Molech rejoices thro the Land from Havilah to Shur: he rejoices

In moral law & its severe penalties: loud Shaddai & Jehovah

40  Thunder above: when they see the Twelve panting Victims

On the Twelve Stones of Power, & the beautiful Daughters of Albion

If you dare rend their Veil with your Spear; you are healed of Love\!

From the Hills of Camberwell & Wimbledon: from the Valleys

Of Walton & Esher: from Stone-henge & from Maidens Cove

Jerusalems Pillars fall in the rendings of fierce War

Over France & Germany: upon the Rhine & Danube

Reuben & Benjamin flee; they hide in the Valley of Rephaim

Why trembles the Warriors limbs when he beholds thy beauty

Spotted with Victims blood? by the fires of thy secret tabernacle

50  And thy ark & holy place: at thy frowns: at thy dire revenge

Smitten as Uzzah of old: his armour is softend; his spear

And sword faint in his hand, from Albion across Great Tartary

O beautiful Daughter of Albion: cruelty is thy delight

O Virgin of terrible eyes, who dwellest by Valleys of springs

Beneath the Mountains of Lebanon, in the City of Rehob in Hamath

Taught to touch the harp: to dance in the Circle of Warriors

Before the Kings of Canaan: to cut the flesh from the Victim

To roast the flesh in fire: to examine the Infants limbs

In cruelties of holiness: to refuse the joys of love: to bring

60  The Spies from Egypt, to raise jealousy in the bosoms of the Twelve

Kings of Canaan: then to let the Spies depart to Meribah Kadesh

To the place of the Amalekite; I am drunk with unsatiated love

I must rush again to War: for the Virgin has frownd &refusd

Sometimes I curse & sometimes bless thy fascinating beauty

Once Man was occupied in intellectual pleasures & energies

But now my soul is harrowd with grief & fear & love & desire

And now I hate & now I love & Intellect is no more:

There is no time for any thing but the torments of love & desire

The Feminine & Masculine Shadows soft, mild & ever varying

70  In beauty: are Shadows now no more, but Rocks in Horeb

PLATE 69

Then all the Males combined into One Male & every one

Became a ravening eating Cancer growing in the Female

A Polypus of Roots of Reasoning Doubt Despair & Death,

Going forth & returning from Albions Rocks to Canaan:

Devouring Jerusalem from every Nation of the Earth.

Envying stood the enormous Form at variance with Itself

In all its Members: in eternal torment of love & jealousy:

Driven forth by Los time after time from Albions cliffy shore,

Drawing the free loves of Jerusalem into infernal bondage;

10  That they might be born in contentions of Chastity & in

Deadly Hate between Leah & Rachel, Daughters of Deceit & Fraud

Bearing the Images of various Species of Contention

And Jealousy & Abhorrence & Revenge & deadly Murder,

Till they refuse liberty to the Male; & not like Beulah

Where every Female delights to give her maiden to her husband

The Female searches sea & land for gratifications to the

Male Genius: who in return clothes her in gems & gold

And feeds her with the food of Eden, hence all her beauty beams

She Creates at her will a little moony night & silence

20  With Spaces of sweet gardens & a tent of elegant beauty:

Closed in by a sandy desart & a night of stars shining,

And a little tender moon & hovering angels on the wing,

And the Male gives a Time & Revolution to her Space

Till the time of love is passed in ever varying delights

For All Things Exist in the Human Imagination

And thence in Beulah they are stolen by secret amorous theft,

Till they have had Punishment enough to make them commit Crimes\[.\]

Hence rose the Tabernacle in the Wilderness & all its Offerings,

From Male & Female Loves in Beulah & their Jealousies

30  But no one can consummate Female bliss in Los’s World without

Becoming a Generated Mortal, a Vegetating Death

And now the Spectres of the Dead awake in Beulah: all

The Jealousies become Murderous: uniting together in Rahab

A Religion of Chastity, forming a Commerce to sell Loves,

With Moral Law, an Equal Balance, not going down with decision

Therefore the Male severe & cruel filld with stern Revenge:

Mutual Hate returns & mutual Deceit & mutual Fear.

Hence the Infernal Veil grows in the disobedient Female:

Which Jesus rends & the whole Druid Law removes away

40  From the Inner Sanctuary: a False Holiness hid within the Center,

For the Sanctuary of Eden, is in the Camp: in the Outline,

In the Circumference: & every Minute Particular is Holy:

Embraces are Cominglings: from the Head even to the Feet;

And not a pompous High Priest entering by a Secret Place.

Jerusalem pined in her inmost soul over Wandering Reuben

As she slept in Beulahs Night hid by the Daughters of Beulah

PLATE 70

And this the form of mighty Hand sitting on Albions cliffs

Before the face of Albion, a mighty threatning Form.

His bosom wide & shoulders huge overspreading wondrous

Bear Three strong sinewy Necks & Three awful & terrible Heads

Three Brains in contradictory council brooding incessantly.

Neither daring to put in act its councils, fearing each-other,

Therefore rejecting Ideas as nothing & holding all Wisdom

To consist, in the agreements & disagree\[me\]nts of Ideas.

Plotting to devour Albions Body of Humanity & Love.

10  Such Form the aggregate of the Twelve Sons of Albion took; & such

Their appearance when combind: but often by birth-pangs & loud groans

They divide to Twelve: the key-bones & the chest dividing in pain

Disclose a hideous orifice; thence issuing the Giant-brood

Arise as the smoke of the furnace, shaking the rocks from sea to sea.

And there they combine into Three Forms, named Bacon & Newton & Locke,

In the Oak Groves of Albion which overspread all the Earth.

Imputing Sin & Righteousness to Individuals;

Rahab Sat deep within him hid: his Feminine Power unreveal’d

Brooding Abstract Philosophy, to destroy Imagination,

the Divine-

-Humanity A Three-fold Wonder: feminine: most

20     beautiful: Three-fold

Each within other. On her white marble & even Neck, her Heart

Inorb’d and bonified: with locks of shadowing modesty, shining

Over her beautiful Female features, soft flourishing in beauty

Beams mild, all love and all perfection, that when the lips

Recieve a kiss from Gods or Men, a threefold kiss returns

From the pressd loveliness: so her whole immortal form three-fold

Three-fold embrace returns: consuming lives of Gods &Men

In fires of beauty melting them as gold & silver in the furnace\[.\]

Her Brain enlabyrinths the whole heaven of her bosom & loins

30  To put in act what her Heart wills; O who can withstand her power

Her name is Vala in Eternity: in Time her name is Rahab

The Starry Heavens all were fled from the mighty limbs of Albion

PLATE 71

And above Albions Land was seen the Heavenly Canaan

As the Substance is to the Shadow: and above Albions Twelve Sons

Were seen Jerusalems Sons: and all the Twelve Tribes spreading

Over Albion. As the Soul is to the Body, so Jerusalems Sons,

Are to the Sons of Albion: and Jerusalem is Albions Emanation

What is Above is Within, for every-thing in Eternity is translucent:

The Circumference is Within: Without, is formed the Selfish Center

And the Circumference still expands going forward to Eternity.

And the Center has Eternal States\! these States we now explore.

10  And these the Names of Albions Twelve Sons, & of his Twelve Daughters

With their Districts. Hand dwelt in Selsey & had Sussex & Surrey

And Kent & Middlesex: all their Rivers & their Hills, of locks & herds:

Their Villages Towns Cities Sea-Ports Temples sublime Cathedrals;

All were his Friends & their Sons & Daughters intermarry in Beulah

For all are Men in Eternity. Rivers Mountains Cities Villages,

All are Human & when you enter into their Bosoms you walk

In Heavens & Earths; as in your own Bosom you bear your Heaven

And Earth, & all you behold, tho it appears Without it is Within

In your Imagination of which this World of Mortality is but a Shadow.

20  Hyle dwelt in Winchester comprehending Hants Dorset Devon Cornwall.

Their Villages Cities SeaPorts, their Corn fields & Gardens spacious

Palaces, Rivers & Mountains, and between Hand & Hyle arose

Gwendolen & Cambel who is Boadicea: they go abroad & return

Like lovely beams of light from the mingled affections of the Brothers

The Inhabitants of the whole Earth rejoice in their beautiful light.

Coban dwelt in Bath. Somerset Wiltshire Gloucestershire,

Obeyd his awful voice Ignoge is his lovely Emanation;

She adjoin’d with Gwantokes Children, soon lovely Cordella arose.

Gwantoke forgave & joyd over South Wales & all its Mountains.

Peachey had North Wales Shropshire Cheshire & the Isle of Man.

His Emanation is Mehetabel terrible & lovely upon the Mountains

Brertun had Yorkshire Durham Westmoreland & his Emanation

Is Ragan, she adjoind to Slade, & produced Gonorill far beaming.

Slade had Lincoln Stafford Derby Nottingham & his lovely

Emanation Gonorill rejoices over hills & rocks & woods & rivers.

Huttn had Warwick Northampton Bedford Buckingham

Leicester & Berkshire: & his Emanation is Gwinefred beautiful

Skofeld had Ely Rutland Cambridge Huntingdon Norfolk

Suffolk Hartford & Essex: & his Emanation is Gwinevera

40  Beautiful, she beams towards the east, all kinds of precious stones

And pearl, with instruments of music in holy Jerusalem

Kox had Oxford Warwick Wilts: his Emanation is Estrild:

Joind with Cordella she shines southward over the Atlantic.

Kotope had Hereford Stafford Worcester, & his Emanation

Is Sabrina joind with Mehetabel she shines west over America

Bowen had all Scotland, the Isles, Northumberland & Cumberland

His Emanation is Conwenna, she shines a triple form

Over the north with pearly beams gorgeous & terrible

Jerusalem & Vala rejoice in Bowen & Conwenna.

50  But the Four Sons of Jerusalem that never were Generated

Are Rintrah and Palamabron and Theotormon and Bromion. They

Dwell over the Four Provinces of Ireland in heavenly light

The Four Universities of Scotland, & in Oxford &Cambridge & Winchester

But now Albion is darkened & Jerusalem lies in ruins:

Above the Mountains of Albion, above the head of Los.

And Los shouted with ceaseless shoutings & his tears pourd down

His immortal cheeks, rearing his hands to heaven for aid Divine\!

But he spoke not to Albion: fearing lest Albion should turn his Back

Against the Divine Vision: & fall over the Precipice of Eternal Death.

60  But he receded before Albion & before Vala weaving the Veil

With the iron shuttle of War among the rooted Oaks of Albion;

Weeping & shouting to the Lord day & night; and his Children

Wept round him as a flock silent Seven Days of Eternity

PLATE 72

And the Thirty-two Counties of the Four Provinces of Ireland

Are thus divided: The Four Counties are in the Four Camps

Munster South in Reubens Gate, Connaut West in Josephs Gate

Ulster North in Dans Gate, Leinster East in Judahs Gate

For Albion in Eternity has Sixteen Gates among his Pillars

But the Four towards the West were Walled up & the Twelve

That front the Four other Points were turned Four Square

By Los for Jerusalems sake & called the Gates of Jerusalem

Because Twelve Sons of Jerusalem fled successive thro the Gates

10  But the Four Sons of Jerusalem who fled not but remaind

Are Rintrah & Palamabron & Theotormon & Bromion

The Four that remain with Los to guard the Western Wall

And these Four remain to guard the Four Walls of Jerusalem

Whose foundations remain in the Thirty-two Counties of Ireland

And in Twelve Counties of Wales, & in the Forty Counties

Of England & in the Thirty-six Counties of Scotland

And the names of the Thirty-two Counties of Ireland are these

Under Judah & Issachar & Zebulun are Lowth Longford

Eastmeath Westmeath Dublin Kildare Kings County

20  Queens County Wicklow Catherloh Wexford Kilkenny

And those under Reuben & Simeon & Levi are these

Waterford Tipperary Cork Limerick Kerry Clare

And those under Ephraim Manasseh & Benjamin are these

Galway Roscommon Mayo Sligo Leitrim

And those under Dan Asher & Napthali are these

Donnegal Antrim Tyrone Fermanagh Armagh Londonderry

Down Managhan Cavan. These are the Land of Erin

All these Center in London & in Golgonooza, from whence

They are Created continually East & West & North & South

30  And from them are Created all the Nations of the Earth

Europe & Asia & Africa & America, in fury Fourfold\!

And Thirty-two the Nations: to dwell in Jerusalems Gates

O Come ye Nations Come ye People Come up to Jerusalem

Return Jerusalem & dwell together as of old: Return

Return: O Albion let Jerusalem overspread all Nations

As in the times of old: O Albion awake: Reuben wanders

The Nations wait for Jerusalem, they look up for the Bride

France Spain Italy Germany Poland Russia Sweden Turkey

Arabia Palestine Persia Hindostan China Tartary Siberia

40  Egypt Lybia Ethiopia Guinea Caffraria Negroland Morocco

Congo Zaara Canada Greenland Carolina Mexico

Peru Patagonia Amazonia Brazil. Thirty-two Nations

And under these Thirty-two Classes of Islands in the Ocean

All the Nations Peoples & Tongues throughout all the Earth

And the Four Gates of Los surround the Universe Within and

Without; & whatever is visible in the Vegetable Earth, the same

Is visible in the Mundane Shell; reversd in mountain & vale

And a Son of Eden was set over each Daughter of Beulah to guard

In Albions Tomb the wondrous Creation: & the Four-gold Gate

Towards Beulah is to the South\[.\] Fenelon, Guion, Teresa,

50  Whitefield & Hervey, guard that Gate; with all the gentle Souls

Who guide the great Wine-press of Love; Four precious Stones that Gate:

PLATE 73

Such are Cathedrons golden Halls: in the City of Golgonooza

And Los’s Furnaces howl loud; living: self-moving: lamenting

With fury & despair, & they stretch from South to North

Thro all the Four Points: Lo\! the Labourers at the Furnaces

Rintrah & Palamabron, Theotormon & Bromion, loud labring

With the innumerable multitudes of Golgonooza, round the Anvils

Of Death. But how they came forth from the Furnaces & how long

Vast & severe the anguish eer they knew their Father; were

Long to tell & of the iron rollers, golden axle-trees & yokes

10  Of brass, iron chains & braces & the gold, silver & brass

Mingled or separate: for swords; arrows; cannons; mortars

The terrible ball: the wedge: the loud sounding hammer of destruction

The sounding flail to thresh: the winnow: to winnow kingdoms

The water wheel & mill of many innumerable wheels resistless

Over the Four fold Monarchy from Earth to the Mundane Shell.

Perusing Albions Tomb in the starry characters of Og & Anak:

To Create the lion & wolf the bear: the tyger & ounce:

To Create the wooly lamb & downy fowl & scaly serpent

The summer & winter: day & night: the sun & moon & stars

20  The tree: the plant: the flower: the rock: the stone: the metal:

Of Vegetative Nature: by their hard restricting condensations.

Where Luvahs World of Opakeness grew to a period: It

Became a Limit, a Rocky hardness without form & void

Accumulating without end: here Los who is of the Elohim

Opens the Furnaces of affliction in the Emanation

Fixing the Sexual into an ever-prolific Generation

Naming the Limit of Opakeness Satan & the Limit of Contraction

Adam, who is Peleg & Joktan: & Esau & Jacob: &Saul & David

Voltaire insinuates that these Limits are the cruel work of God

30  Mocking the Remover of Limits & the Resurrection of the Dead

Setting up Kings in wrath: in holiness of Natural Religion

Which Los with his mighty Hammer demolishes time on time

In miracles & wonders in the Four-fold Desart of Albion

Permanently Creating to be in Time Reveald & Demolishd

Satan Cain Tubal Nimrod Pharoh Priam Bladud Belin

Arthur Alfred the Norman Conqueror Richard John

\[*Edward Henry Elizabeth James Charles William George*\]

And all the Kings & Nobles of the Earth & all their Glories

These are Created by Rahab & Tirzah in Ulro: but around

40  These, to preserve them from Eternal Death Los Creates

Adam Noah Abraham Moses Samuel David Ezekiel

\[*Pythagoras Socrates Euripedes Virgil Dante Milton*\]

Dissipating the rocky forms of Death, by his thunderous Hammer\[.\]

As the Pilgrim passes while the Country permanent remains

So Men pass on: but States remain permanent for ever

The Spectres of the Dead howl round the porches of Los

In the terrible Family feuds of Albions cities & villages

To devour the Body of Albion, hungring & thirsting & ravning

The Sons of Los clothe them & feed, & provide houses & gardens

50  And every Human Vegetated Form in its inward recesses

Is a house of ple\[as\]antness & a garden of delight Built by the

Sons & Daughters of Los in Bowlahoola & in Cathedron

From London to York & Edinburgh the Furnaces rage terrible

Primrose Hill is the mouth of the Furnace & the Iron Door;

PLATE 74

The Four Zoa’s clouded rage; Urizen stood by Albion

With Rintrah and Palamabron and Theotormon and Bromion

These Four are Verulam & London & York & Edinburgh

And the Four Zoa’s are Urizen & Luvah & Tharmas & Urthona

In opposition deadly, and their Wheels in poisonous

And deadly stupor turn’d against each other loud & fierce

Entering into the Reasoning Power, forsaking Imagination

They became Spectres; & their Human Bodies were reposed

In Beulah, by the Daughters of Beulah with tears & lamentations

10  The Spectre is the Reasoning Power in Man; & when separated

From Imagination, and closing itself as in steel, in a Ratio

Of the Things of Memory, It thence frames Laws & Moralities

To destroy Imagination\! the Divine Body, by Martyrdoms & Wars

Teach me O Holy Spirit the Testimony of Jesus\! let me

Comprehend wonderous things out of the Divine Law\[.\]

I behold Babylon in the opening Streets of London, I behold

Jerusalem in ruins wandering about from house

to house This I behold the shudderings of death attend my steps

I walk up and down in Six Thousand Years: their

    Events are present before me

20  To tell how Los in grief & anger, whirling round his Hammer on high

Drave the Sons & Daughters of Albion from their ancient mountains

They became the Twelve Gods of Asia Opposing the Divine Vision

The Sons of Albion are Twelve: the Sons of Jerusalem Sixteen

I tell how Albions Sons by Harmonies of Concords & Discords

Opposed to Melody, and by Lights & Shades, opposed to Outline

And by Abstraction opposed to the Visions of Imagination

By cruel Laws divided Sixteen into Twelve Divisions

How Hyle roofd Los in Albions Cliffs by the Affections rent

Asunder & opposed to Thought, to draw Jerusalems Sons

30  Into the Vortex of his Wheels, therefore Hyle is called Gog

Age after age drawing them away towards Babylon

Babylon, the Rational Morality deluding to death the little ones

In strong temptations of stolen beauty; I tell how Reuben slept

On London Stone & the Daughters of Albion ran around admiring

His awful beauty: with Moral Virtue the fair deciever; offspring

Of Good & Evil, they divided him in love upon the Thames & sent

Him over Europe in streams of gore out of Cathedrons Looms

How Los drave them from Albion & they became Daughters of Canaan

Hence Albion was calld the Canaanite & all his Giant Sons.

40  Hence is my Theme. O Lord my Saviour, open thou the Gates

And I will lead forth thy Words, telling how the Daughters

Cut the Fibres of Reuben, how he rolld apart & took Root

In Bashan, terror-struck Albions Sons look toward Bashan

They have divided Simeon he also rolld apart in blood

Over the Nations till he took Root beneath the shining Looms

Of Albions Daughters in Philistea by the side of Amalek

They have divided Levi: he hath shot out into Forty eight Roots

Over the Land of Canaan: they have divided Judah

He hath took Root in Hebron, in the Land of Hand & Hyle

50  Dan: Napthali: Gad: Asher: Issachar: Zebulun: roll apart

From all the Nations of the Earth to dissipate into Non Entity

I see a Feminine Form arise from the Four terrible Zoas

Beautiful but terrible struggling to take a form of beauty

Rooted in Shechem: this is Dinah, the youthful form of Erin

The Wound I see in South Molton S\[t\]reet & Stratford place

Whence Joseph & Benjamin rolld apart away from the Nations

In vain they rolld apart; they are fixed into the Land of Cabul

PLATE 75

And Rahab Babylon the Great hath destroyed Jerusalem

Bath stood upon the Severn with Merlin & Bladud & Arthur

The Cup of Rahab in his hand: her Poisons Twenty-seven-fold

And all her Twenty-seven Heavens now hid & now reveal’d

Appear in strong delusive light of Time & Space drawn out

In shadowy pomp by the Eternal Prophet created evermore

For Los in Six Thousand Years walks up & down continually

That not one Moment of Time be lost & every revolution

Of Space he makes permanent in Bowlahoola & Cathedron.

10  And these the names of the Twenty-seven Heavens & their Churches

Adam, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch,

Methuselah, Lamech; these are the Giants mighty, Hermaphroditic

Noah, Shem, Arphaxad, Cainan the Second, Salah, Heber,

Peleg, Reu, Serug, Nahor, Terah: these are the Female Males:

A Male within a Female hid as in an Ark & Curtains.

Abraham, Moses, Solomon, Paul, Constantine, Charlemaine,

Luther. these Seven are the Male Females: the Dragon Forms

The Female hid within a Male: thus Rahab is reveald

Mystery Babylon the Great: the Abomination of Desolation

20  Religion hid in War: a Dragon red, & hidden Harlot

But Jesus breaking thro’ the Central Zones of Death & Hell

Opens Eternity in Time & Space; triumphant in Mercy

Thus are the Heavens formd by Los within the Mundane Shell

And where Luther ends Adam begins again in Eternal Circle

To awake the Prisoners of Death; to bring Albion again

With Luvah into light eternal, in his eternal day.

But now the Starry Heavens are fled from the mighty limbs of Albion

PLATE 77

                         TO THE CHRISTIANS

   Devils are                            I give you the end of a

False Religions                             golden string,

     ‘Saul Saul’                          Only wind it into a ball:

‘Why persecutest thou me.’     It will lead you in at

                                                    Heavens gate,

                                                Built in Jerusalems wall.

    We are told to abstain from fleshly desires that we may lose no time from the Work of the Lord. Every moment lost, is a moment that cannot be redeemed every pleasure that intermingles with the duty of our station is a folly unredeemable & is planted like the seed of a wild flower among our wheat. All the tortures of repentance, are tortures of self-reproach on account of our leaving the DivineHarvest to the Enemy, the struggles of intanglement with incoherent roots. I know of no other Christianity and of no other Gospel than the liberty both of body & mind

10  to exercise the Divine Arts of Imagination Imagination

the real & eternal World of which this Vegetable Universe is but a faint shadow & in which we shall live in our Eternal or Imaginative Bodies, when these Vegetable Mortal Bodies are no more. The Apostles knew of no other Gospel. What were all their spiritual gifts? What is the Divine Spirit? is the Holy Ghost any other than an Intellectual Fountain? What is the Harvest of the Gospel & its Labours? What is that Talent which it is a curse to

20  hide? What are the Treasures of Heaven which we are to

lay up for ourselves, are they any other than Mental Studies & Performances? What are all the Gifts of the Gospel, are they not all Mental Gifts? Is God a Spirit who must be worshipped in Spirit & in Truth and are not the Gifts of the Spirit Every-thing to Man? O ye Religious discountenance every one among you who shall pretend to despise Art & Science\! I call upon you in the Name of Jesus\! What is the Life of Man but Art & Science? is it Meat & Drink? is not the Body more than Raiment?

30  What is Mortality but the things relating to the Body,

which Dies? What is Immortality but the things relating to the Spirit, which Lives Eternally\! What is the Joy of Heaven but Improvement in the things of the Spirit? What are the Pains of Hell but Ignorance, Bodily Lust, Idleness & devastation of the things of the Spiritf?\] Answer this to yourselves, & expel from among you those who pretend to despise the labours of Art & Science which alone are the labours of the Gospel: Is not this plain & manifest to the thought? Can you think at all & not

40  pronounce heartily\! That to Labour in Knowledge, is to

Build up Jerusalem: and to Despise Knowledge, is to Despise Jerusalem & her Builders. And remember: He who despises & mocks a Mental Gift in another; calling it pride & selfishness & sin; mocks Jesus the giver of every Mental Gift, which always appear to the ignorance-loving Hypocrite, as Sins, but that which is a Sin in the sight of cruel Man, is not so in the sight of our kind God.

50      Let every Christian as much as in him lies engage himself

openly & publicly before all the World in some Mental pursuit for the Building up of Jerusalem

         I stood among my valleys of the south

      And saw a flame of fire, even as a Wheel

      Of fire surrounding all the heavens: it went

      From west to east against the current of

      Creation and devourd all things in its loud

      Fury & thundering course round heaven & earth

      By it the Sun was rolld into an orb:

      By it the Moon faded into a globe,

      Travelling thro the night: for from its dire

      10  And restless fury, Man himself shrunk up

      Into a little root a fathom long.

      And I asked a Watcher & a Holy-One

      Its Name? he answerd. It is the Wheel of Religion

      I wept & said. Is this the law of Jesus

      This terrible devouring sword turning every way

      He answerd; Jesus died because he strove

      Against the current of this Wheel: its Name

      Is Caiaphas, the dark Preacher of Death

      Of sin, of sorrow, & of punishment;

      20  Opposing Nature\! It is Natural Religion

      But Jesus is the bright Preacher of Life

      Creating Nature from this fiery Law,

      By self-denial & forgiveness of Sin.

      Go therefore, cast out devils in Christs name

      Heal thou the sick of spiritual disease

      Pity the evil, for thou art not sent

      To smite with terror & with punishments

      Those that are sick, like to the Pharisees

      Crucifying & encompassing sea & land

      30  For proselytes to tyranny & wrath.

      But to the Publicans & Harlots go\!

      Teach them True Happiness, but let no curse

      Go forth out of thy mouth to blight their peace

      For Hell is opend to Heaven; thine eyes beheld

      The dungeons burst & the Prisoners set free.

England\! awake\! awake\! awake\!

Jerusalem thy Sister calls\!

Why wilt thou sleep the sleep of death?

And close her from thy ancient walls.

                 Thy hills & valleys felt her feet,

                 Gently upon their bosoms move:

                 Thy gates beheld sweet Zions ways;

                 Then was a time of joy and love.

        And now the time returns again:

        Our souls exult & Londons towers,

        Receive the Lamb of God to dwell

        In Englands green & pleasant bowers.

PLATE 78

JERUSALEM

C4

   The Spectres of Albions Twelve Sons revolve mightily

Over the Tomb & over the Body: ravning to devour

The Sleeping Humanity. Los with his mace of iron

Walks round: loud his threats, loud his blows fall

On the rocky Spectres, as the Potter breaks the potsherds;

Dashing in pieces Self-righteousnesses: driving them from Albions

Cliffs: dividing them into Male & Female forms in his Furnaces

And on his Anvils: lest they destroy the Feminine Affections

They are broken. Loud howl the Spectres in his iron Furnace

10  While Los laments at his dire labours, viewing Jerusalem,

Sitting before his Furnaces clothed in sackcloth of hair;

Albions Twelve Sons surround the Forty-two Gates of Erin,

In terrible armour, raging against the Lamb & against Jerusalem,

Surrounding them with armies to destroy the Lamb of God.

They took their Mother Vala, and they crown’d her with gold:

They namd her Rahab, & gave her power over the Earth

The Concave Earth round Golgonooza in Entuthon Benython,

Even to the stars exalting her Throne, to build beyond the Throne

Of God and the Lamb, to destroy the Lamb & usurp the Throne of God

Drawing their Ulro Voidness round the Four-fold

20       Humanity

Naked Jerusalem lay before the Gates upon Mount Zion  
The Hill of Giants, all her foundations levelld with the dust\!

Her Twelve Gates thrown down: her children carried into captivity

Herself in chains: this from within was seen in a dismal night

Outside, unknown before in Beulah, & the twelve gates were fill’d

With blood; from Japan eastward to the Giants causway, west

In Erins Continent: and Jerusalem wept upon Euphrates banks

Disorganizd; an evanescent shade, scarce seen or heard among

Her childrens Druid Temples dropping with blood wanderd weeping\!

30   And thus her voice went forth in the darkness of Philisthea.

My brother & my father are no more\! God hath forsaken me

The arrows of the Almighty pour upon me & my children

I have sinned and am an outcast from the Divine Presence\!

  PLATE 79

My tents are fall’n\! my pillars are in ruins\! my children dashd

Upon Egypts iron floors, & the marble pavements of Assyria;

I melt my soul in reasonings among the towers of Heshbon;

Mount Zion is become a cruel rock & no more dew

Nor rain: no more the spring of the rock appears: but cold

Hard & obdurate are the furrows of the mountain of wine & oil:

The mountain of blessing is itself a curse & an astonishment:

The hills of Judea are fallen with me into the deepest hell

Away from the Nations of the Earth, & from the Cities of the Nations;

10  I walk to Ephraim, I seek for Shiloh: I walk like a lost sheep

Among precipices of despair: in Goshen I seek for light  
In vain: and in Gilead for a physician and a comforter.  
Goshen hath followd Philistea: Gilead hath joind with Og\!

They are become narrow places in a little and dark land:

How distant far from Albion\! his hills & his valleys no more

Recieve the feet of Jerusalem: they have cast me quite away:

And Albion is himself shrunk to a narrow rock in the midst of the sea\!

The plains of Sussex & Surrey, their hills of flocks & herds

No more seek to Jerusalem nor to the sound of my Holy-ones.

20  The Fifty-two Counties of England are hardend against me

As if I was not their Mother, they despise me & cast me out

London coverd the whole Earth. England encompassd the Nations:

And all the Nations of the Earth were seen in the Cities of Albion:

My pillars reachd from sea to sea: London beheld me come

From my east & from my west; he blessed me and gave

His children to my breasts, his sons & daughters to my knees

His aged parents sought me out in every city & village:

They discernd my countenance with joy\! they shewd me to their sons

Saying Lo Jerusalem is here\! she sitteth in our secret chambers

30  Levi and Judah & Issachar: Ephra\[i\]m, Manasseh, Gad and Dan

Are seen in our hills & valleys: they keep our flocks & herds:

They watch them in the night: and the Lamb of God appears among us\!

The river Severn stayd his course at my command:  
Thames pourd his waters into my basons and baths:  
Medway mingled with Kishon: Thames recievd the heavenly Jordan

Albion gave me to the whole Earth to walk up & down; to pour

Joy upon every mountain, to teach songs to the shepherd & plowman

I taught the ships of the Sea to sing the songs of Zion.  
Italy saw me, in sublime astonishment: France was wholly mine:

40  As my garden & as my secret bath; Spain was my heavenly couch:

I slept in his golden hills: the Lamb of God met me there.

There we walked as in our secret chamber among our little ones

They looked upon our loves with joy: they beheld our secret joys:

With holy raptures of adoration rapd sublime in the Visions of God:

Germany; Poland & the North wooed my footsteps they found

My gates in all their mountains & my curtains in all their vales

The furniture of their houses was the furniture of my chamber

Turkey & Grecia saw my instr\[u\]ments of music, they arose

They siezd the harp: the flute: the mellow horn of Jerusalems joy

50  They sounded thanksgivings in my courts: Egypt & Lybia heard

The swarthy sons of Ethiopia stood round the Lamb of God

Enquiring for Jerusalem: he led them up my steps to my altar:

And thou America\! I once beheld thee but now behold no more

Thy golden mountains where my Cherubim & Seraphim rejoicd

Together among my little-ones. But now, my Altars run with blood\!

My fires are corrupt\! my incense is a cloudy pestilence

Of seven diseases\! Once a continual cloud of salvation, rose

From all my myriads; once the Four-fold World rejoicd among

The pillars of Jerusalem, between my winged Cherubim:

60  But now I am closd out from them in the narrow passages

Of the valleys of destruction, into a dark land of pitch & bitumen.

From Albions Tomb afar and from the four-fold wonders of God

Shrunk to a narrow doleful form in the dark land of Cabul;

There is Reuben & Gad & Joseph & Judah & Levi, closd up

In narrow vales: I walk & count the bones of my beloveds

Along the Valley of Destruction, among these Druid Temples

Which overspread all the Earth in patriarchal pomp & cruel pride

Tell me O Vala thy purposes; tell me wherefore thy shuttles

Drop with the gore of the slain; why Euphrates is red with blood

70  Wherefore in dreadful majesty & beauty outside appears

Thy Masculine from thy Feminine hardening against the heavens

To devour the Human\! Why dost thou weep upon the wind among

These cruel Druid Temples: O Vala\! Humanity is far above

Sexual organization; & the Visions of the Night of Beulah

Where Sexes wander in dreams of bliss among the Emanations

Where the Masculine & Feminine are nurs’d into Youth & Maiden

By the tears & smiles of Beulahs Daughters till the time of Sleep is past.

Wherefore then do you realize these nets of beauty & delusion

In open day to draw the souls of the Dead into the light,

80  Till Albion is shut out from every Nation under Heaven.

PLATE 80

Encompassd by the frozen Net and by the rooted Tree  
I walk weeping in pangs of a Mothers torment for her Children:

I walk in affliction: I am a worm, and no living soul\!  
A worm going to eternal torment: raisd up in a night  
To an eternal night of pain, lost\! lost\! lost\! for ever\!

Beside her Vala howld upon the winds in pride of beauty

Lamenting among the timbrels of the Warriors: among the Captives

In cruel holiness, and her lamenting songs were from Arnon

And Jordan to Euphrates. Jerusalem followd trembling

10  Her children in captivity, listening to Valas lamentation

condemnation in fierce burning flames

In the thick cloud & darkness, & the voice went forth from

The cloud. O rent in sunder from Jerusalem the Harlot daughter\!

In an eternal condemnation in fierce burning flames

Of torment unendurable: and if once a Delusion be found

Woman must perish & the Heavens of Heavens remain no more

My Father gave to me command to murder Albion

In unreviving Death; my Love, my Luvah orderd me in night

To murder Albion the King of Men, he fought in battles fierce

He conquerd Luvah my beloved: he took me and my Father

20  He slew them: I revived them to life in my warm bosom

He saw them issue from my bosom, dark in Jealousy

He burnd before me: Luvah framd the Knife & Luvah gave

The Knife into his daughters hand: such thing was never known

Before in Albions land, that one should die a death never to be reviv’d

For in our battles we the Slain men view with pity and love:

We soon revive them in the secret of our tabernacles

But I Vala, Luvahs daughter, keep his body embalmd in moral laws

With spices of sweet odours of lovely jealous stupefaction:

Within my bosom, lest he arise to life & slay my Luvah

30  Pity me then O Lamb of God\! O Jesus pity me\!

Come into Luvahs Tents, and seek not to revive the Dead\!

So sang she: and the Spindle turnd furious as she sang:

The Children of Jerusalem the Souls of those who sleep

Were caught into the flax of her Distaff, & in her Cloud

To weave Jerusalem a body according to her will

A Dragon form on Zion Hills most ancient promontory

The Spindle turnd in blood & fire: loud sound the trumpets

Of war: the cymbals play loud before the Captains

With Cambel & Gwendolen in dance and solemn song

40  The Cloud of Rahab vibrating with the Daughters of Albion

Los saw terrified, melted with pity & divided in wrath

He sent them over the narrow seas in pity and love

Among the Four Forests of Albion which overspread all the Earth

They go forth & return swift as a flash of lightning,

Among the tribes of warriors: among the Stones of power\!

Against Jerusalem they rage thro all the Nations of Europe

Thro Italy & Grecia, to Lebanon & Persia & India.

The Serpent Temples thro the Earth, from the wide Plain of Salisbury

Resound with cries of Victims, shouts & songs & dying groans

50  And flames of dusky fire, to Amalek, Canaan and Moab\[.\]

And Rahab like a dismal and indefinite hovering Cloud

Refusd to take a definite form, she hoverd over all the Earth

Calling the definite, sin: defacing every definite form;

Invisible, or Visible, stretchd out in length or spread in breadth:

Over the Temples drinking groans of victims weeping in pity,

And joying in the pity, howling over Jerusalems walls.

Hand slept on Skiddaws top: drawn by the love of beautiful

Cambel: his bright, beaming Counterpart, divided from him

And her delusive light beamd fierce above the Mountain,

60  Soft: invisible: drinking his sighs in sweet intoxication:

Drawing out fibre by fibre: returning to Albions Tree

At night: and in the morning to Skiddaw; she sent him over

Mountainous Wales into the Loom of Cathedron fibre by fibre:

He ran in tender nerves across Europe to Jerusalems Shade,

To weave Jerusalem a Body repugnant to the Lamb.

Hyle on East Moor in rocky Derbyshire, rav’d to the Moon

For Gwendolen: she took up in bitter tears his anguishd heart,

That apparent to all in Eternity, glows like the Sun in the breast:

She hid it in his ribs & back: she hid his tongue with teeth

70  In terrible convulsions pitying & gratified drunk with pity

Glowing with loveliness before him, becoming apparent

According to his changes: she roll’d his kidneys round

Into two irregular forms: and looking on Albions dread Tree,

She wove two vessels of seed, beautiful as Skiddaws snow;

Giving them bends of self interest & selfish natural virtue:

She hid them in his loins; raving he ran among the rocks,

Compelld into a shape of Moral Virtue against the Lamb.

The invisible lovely one giving him a form according to

His Law a form against the Lamb of God opposd to Mercy

80  And playing in the thunderous Loom in sweet intoxication

Filling cups of silver & crystal with shrieks & cries, with groans

And dolorous sobs: the wine of lovers in the Wine-press of Luvah

O sister Cambel said Gwendolen, as their long beaming light

Mingled above the Mountain\[:\] what shall we do to keep

These awful forms in our soft bands: vdistracted with trembling

PLATE 81

I have mockd those who refused cruelty & I have admired

The cruel Warrior. I have refused to give love to Merlin the piteous.

He brings to me the Images of his Love & I reject in chastity

And turn them out into the streets for Harlots to be food

To the stern Warrior. I am become perfect in beauty over my Warrior

For Men are caught by Love: Woman is caught by Pride

That Love may only be obtaind in the passages of Death.

Let us look: let us examine: is the Cruel become an Infant

Or is he still a cruel Warrior? look Sisters, look\! O piteous

10  I have destroyd Wandring Reuben who strove to bind my Will

I have stripd off Josephs beautiful integument for my Beloved,

The Cruel-one of Albion: to clothe him in gems of my Zone

I have named him Jehovah of Hosts. Humanity is become

A weeping Infant in ruind lovely Jerusalems folding Cloud:

In Heaven Love begets Love\! but Fear is the Parent of Earthly Love\!

And he who will not bend to Love must be subdud by Fear,

PLATE 82

I have heard Jerusalems groans; from Vala’s cries & lamentations

I gather our eternal fate: Outcasts from life and love:

Unless we find a way to bind these awful Forms to our

Embrace we shall perish annihilate, discoverd our Delusions.

Look I have wrought without delusion: Look\! I have wept\!

And given soft milk mingled together with the spirits of flocks

Of lambs and doves, mingled together in cups and dishes

Of painted clay; the mighty Hyle is become a weeping infant;

Soon shall the Spectres of the Dead follow my weaving threads.

10  The Twelve Daughters of Albion attentive listen in secret shades

On Cambridge and Oxford beaming soft uniting with Rahabs cloud

While Gwendolen spoke to Cambel turning soft the spinning reel:

Or throwing the wingd shuttle; or drawing the cords with softest songs

The golden cords of the Looms animate beneath their touches soft,

Along the Island white, among the Druid Temples, while Gwendolen

Spoke to the Daughters of Albion standing on Skiddaws top.

So saying she took a Falsehood & hid it in her left hand:

To entice her Sisters away to Babylon on Euphrates.

And thus she closed her left hand and utterd her Falshood:

20  Forgetting that Falshood is prophetic, she hid her hand behind her,

Upon her back behind her loins & thus utterd her Deceit.

I heard Enitharmon say to Los: Let the Daughters of Albion

Be scatterd abroad and let the name of Albion be forgotten:

Divide them into three: name them Amalek Canaan & Moab:

Let Albion remain a desolation without an inhabitant:

And let the Looms of Enitharmon & the Furnaces of Los

Create Jerusalem, & Babylon & Egypt & Moab & Amalek,

And Helle & Hesperia & Hindostan & China & Japan.

But hide America, for a Curse an Altar of Victims & a Holy Place.

30  See Sisters Canaan is pleasant, Egypt is as the Garden of Eden:

Babylon is our chief desire, Moab our bath in summer:

Let us lead the stems of this Tree let us plant it before Jerusalem

To judge the Friend of Sinners to death without the Veil:

To cut her off from America, to close up her secret Ark:

And the fury of Man exhaust in War, Woman permanent remain

See how the fires of our loins point eastward to Babylon

Look, Hyle is become an infant Love: look\! behold\! see him lie\!

Upon my bosom, look\! here is the lovely wayward form

That gave me sweet delight by his torments beneath my Veil;

40  By the fruit of Albions Tree I have fed him with sweet milk

By contentions of the mighty for Sacrifice of Captives;

Humanity the Great Delusion: is changd to War & Sacrifice:

I have naild his hands on Beth Rabbim & his \[feet\] on Heshbons Wall:

O that I could live in his sight: O that I could bind him to my arm.

So saying: She drew aside her Veil from Mam-Tor to Dovedale

Discovering her own perfect beauty to the Daughters of Albion

And Hyle a winding Worm beneath \[*her Loom upon the scales.*

*Hyle was become a winding Worm*:\] & not a weeping Infant.

Trembling & pitying she screamd & fled upon the wind:

50  Hyle was a winding Worm and herself perfect in beauty:

The desarts tremble at his wrath: they shrink themselves in fear.

Cambel trembled with jealousy: she trembled\! she envied\!

The envy ran thro Cathedrons Looms into the Heart

Of mild Jerusalem, to destroy the Lamb of God. Jerusalem

Languishd upon Mount Olivet, East of mild Zions Hill.

Los saw the envious blight above his Seventh Furnace

On Londons Tower on the Thames: he drew Cambel in wrath,

Into his thundering Bellows, heaving it for a loud blast\!

And with the blast of his Furnace upon fishy Billingsgate,

60  Beneath Albions fatal Tree, before the Gate of Los:

Shewd her the fibres of her beloved to ameliorate

The envy; loud she labourd in the Furnace of fire,

To form the mighty form of Hand according to her will.

In the Furnaces of Los & in the Wine-press treading day & night

Naked among the human clusters: bringing wine of anguish

To feed the afflicted in the Furnaces: she minded not

The raging flames, the she returnd \[*consumd day after day*

*A redning skeleton in howling woe*:\] instead of beauty

Defo\[r\]mity: she gave her beauty to another: bearing abroad

70  Her struggling torment in her iron arms: and like a chain,

Binding his wrists & ankles with the iron arms of love.

Gwendolen saw the Infant in her siste\[r\]s arms; she howld

Over the forests with bitter tears, and over the winding Worm

Repentant: and she also in the eddying wind of Los’s Bellows

Began her dolorous task of love in the Wine-press of Luvah

To form the Worm into a form of love by tears & pain.

The Sisters saw\! trembling ran thro their Looms\! soften\[in\]g mild

Towards London: then they saw the Furna\[c\]es opend, & in tears

Began to give their souls away in the Furna\[c\]es of affliction.

80  Los saw & was comforted at his Furnaces uttering thus his voice.

I know I am Urthona keeper of the Gates of Heaven,

And that I can at will expatiate in the Gardens of bliss;

But pangs of love draw me down to my loins which are

Become a fountain of veiny pipes: O Albion\! my brother\!

PLATE 83

Corrup\[t\]ability appears upon thy limbs, and never more

Can I arise and leave thy side, but labour here incessant

Till thy awaking: yet alas I shall forget Eternity:

Against the Patriarchal pomp and cruelty, labouring incessant

I shall become an Infant horror. Enion\! Tharmas\! friends

Absorb me not in such dire grief: O Albion, my brother\!

Jerusalem hungers in the desart: affection to her children\!

The scorn’d and contemnd youthful girl, where shall she fly?

10  Sussex shuts up her Villages. Hants, Devon & Wilts

Surrounded with masses of stone in orderd forms, determine then

A form for Vala and a form for Luvah, here on the Thames

Where the Victim nightly howls beneath the Druids knife:

A Form of Vegetation, nail them down on the stems of Mystery:

O when shall the Saxon return with the English his redeemed brother\!

O when shall the Lamb of God descend among the Reprobate\!

I woo to Amalek to protect my fugitives\[.\] Amalek trembles:

I call to Canaan & Moab in my night watches, they mourn:

They listen not to my cry, they rejo\[i\]ce among their warriors

Woden and Thor and Friga wholly consume my Saxons:

20  On their enormous Altars built in the terrible north:

From Irelands rocks to Scandinavia Persia and Tartary:

From the Atlantic Sea to the universal Erythrean.

Found ye London\! enormous City\! weeps thy River?

Upon his parent bosom lay thy little ones O Land

Forsaken. Surrey and Sussex are Enitharmons Chamber.

Where I will build her a Couch of repose & my pillars

Shall surround her in beautiful labyrinths: Oothoon?

Where hides my child? in Oxford hidest thou with Antamon?

In graceful hidings of error: in merciful deceit

30  Lest Hand the terrible destroy his Affection. thou hidest her:

In chaste appearances for sweet deceits of love & modesty

Immingled, interwoven, glistening to the sickening sight.

Let Cambel and her Sisters sit within the Mundane Shell:

Forming the fluctuating Globe according to their will.

According as they weave the little embryon nerves & veins

The Eye, the little Nostrils, & the delicate Tongue & Ears

Of labyrinthine intricacy: so shall they fold the World

That whatever is seen upon the Mundane Shell, the same

Be seen upon the Fluctuating Earth woven by the Sisters.

40  And sometimes the Earth shall roll in the Abyss & sometimes

Stand in the Center & sometimes stretch flat in the Expanse,

According to the will of the lovely Daughters of Albion.

Sometimes it shall assimilate with mighty Golgonooza:

Touching its summits: & sometimes divided roll apart.

As a beautiful Veil so these Females shall fold & unfold

According to their will the outside surface of the Earth

An outside shadowy Surface superadded to the real Surface;

Which is unchangeable for ever & ever Amen: so be it\!

Separate Albions Sons gently from their Emanations,

50  Weaving bowers of delight on the current of infant Thames

Where the old Parent still retains his youth as I alas\!

Retain my youth eight thousand and five hundred years.

The labourer of ages in the Valleys of Despair:

The land is markd for desolation & unless we plant

The seeds of Cities & of Villages in the Human bosom

Albion must be a rock of blood: mark ye the points

Where Cities shall remain & where Villages\[;\] for the rest:

It must lie in confusion till Albions time of awaking.

Place the Tribes of Llewellyn in America for a hiding place:

60  Till sweet Jerusalem emanates again into Eternity

The night falls thick: I go upon my watch: be attentive:

The Sons of Albion go forth; I follow from my Furnaces:

That they return no more: that a place be prepard on Euphrates

Listen to your Watchmans voice: sleep not before the Furnaces

Eternal Death stands at the door. O God pity our labours.

So Los spoke, to the Daughters of Beulah while his Emanation

Like a faint rainbow waved before him in the awful gloom

Of London City on the Thames from Surrey Hills to Highgate:

Swift turn the silver spindles, & the golden weights play soft

70  And lulling harmonies beneath the Looms, from Caithness in the north

To Lizard-point & Dover in the south: his Emanation

Joy’d in the many weaving threads in bright Cathedrons Dome

Weaving the Web of life for Jerusalem, the Web of life

Down flowing into Entuthons Vales glistens with soft affections.

While Los arose upon his Watch, and down from Golgonooza

Putting on his golden sandals to walk from mountain to mountain,

He takes his way, girding himself with gold & in his hand

Holding his iron mace: The Spectre remains attentive

Alternate they watch in night: alternate labour in day

80  Before the Furnaces labouring, while Los all night watches

The stars rising & setting, & the meteors & terrors of night.

With him went down the Dogs of Leutha, at his feet

They lap the water of the trembling Thames then follow swift

And thus he heard the voice of Albions daughters on Euphrates,

Our Father Albions land: O it was a lovely land\! & the Daughters of Beulah

Walked up and down in its green mountains: but Hand is fled

Away: & mighty Hyle: & after them Jerusalem is gone: Awake

PLATE 84

Highgates heights & Hampsteads, to Poplar Hackney & Bow

To Islington & Paddington & the Brook of Albions River

We builded Jerusalem as a City & a Temple: from Lambeth

We began our Foundations; lovely Lambeth\! O lovely Hills

Of Camberwell, we shall behold you no more in glory & pride

For Jerusalem lies in ruins & the Furnaces of Los are builded there

You are now shrunk up to a narrow Rock in the midst of the Sea

But here we build Babylon on Euphrates, compelld to build

And to inhabit, our Little-ones to clothe in armour of the gold

10  Of Jerusalems Cherubims & to forge them swords of her Altars

I see London blind & age-bent begging thro the Streets

Of Babylon, led by a child, his tears run down his beard

The voice of Wandering Reuben ecchoes from street to street

In all the Cities of the Nations Paris Madrid Amsterdam

The Corner of Broad Street weeps; Poland Street languishes

To Great Queen Street & Lincolns Inn, all is distress & woe.

         \[three lines gouged out irrecoverably\]

20  The night falls thick Hand comes from Albion in his strength

He combines into a Mighty-one the Double Molech & Chemosh

Marching thro Egypt in his fury the East is pale at his course

The Nations of India, the Wild Tartar that never knew Man

Starts from his lofty places & casts down his tents & flees away

But we woo him all the night in songs, O Los come forth O Los

Divide us from these terrors & give us power them to subdue

Arise upon thy Watches let us see thy Globe of fire

On Albions Rocks & let thy voice be heard upon Euphrates.

Thus sang the Daughters in lamentation, uniting into One

30  With Rahab as she turnd the iron Spindle of destruction.

Terrified at the Sons of Albion they took the Falshood which

Gwendolen hid in her left hand, it grew & grew till it

PLATE 85

Became a Space & an Allegory around the Winding Worm\[.\]

They namd it Canaan & built for it a tender Moon

Los smild with joy thinking on Enitharmon & he brought

Reuben from his twelvefold wandrings & led him into it

Planting the Seeds of the Twelve Tribes & Moses & David

And gave a Time & Revolution to the Space Six Thousand Years

He calld it Divine Analogy, for in Beulah the Feminine

Emanations Create Space, the Masculine Create Time, & plant

The Seeds of beauty in the Space: listning to their lamentation

10  Los walks upon his ancient Mountains in the deadly darkness

Among his Furnaces directing his laborious Myriads watchful

Looking to the East: & his voice is heard over the whole Earth

As he watches the Furnaces by night, & directs the labourers

And thus Los replies upon his Watch: the Valleys listen silent:

The Stars stand still to hear: Jerusalem & Vala cease to mourn:

His voice is heard from Albion: the Alps & Appenines

Listen: Hermon & Lebanon bow their crowned heads

Babel & Shinar look toward the Western Gate, they sit down

Silent at his voice: they view the red Globe of fire in Los’s hand

20  As he walks from Furnace to Furnace directing the Labourers

And this is the Song of Los, the Song that he sings on his Watch

O lovely mild Jerusalem\! O Shiloh of Mount Ephraim\!

I see thy Gates of precious stones: thy Walls of gold & silver

Thou art the soft reflected Image of the Sleeping Man

Who stretchd on Albions rocks reposes amidst his Twenty-eight

Cities: where Beulah lovely terminates, in the hills & valleys of Albion

Cities not yet embodied in Time and Space: plant ye

The Seeds O Sisters in the bosom of Time & Spaces womb

To spring up for Jerusalem: lovely Shadow of Sleeping Albion

30  Why wilt thou rend thyself apart & build an Earthly Kingdom

To reign in pride & to opress & to mix the Cup of Delusion

O thou that dwellest with Babylon\! Come forth O lovely-one

PLATE 86

I see thy Form O lovely mild Jerusalem, Wingd with Six Wings

In the opacous Bosom of the Sleeper, lovely Three-fold

In Head & Heart & Reins three Universes of love & beauty

Thy forehead bright: Holiness to the Lord, with Gates of pearl

Reflects Eternity beneath thy azure wings of feathery down

Ribbd delicate & clothd with featherd gold & azure & purple

From thy white shoulders shadowing, purity in holiness\!

Thence featherd with soft crimson of the ruby bright as fire

Spreading into the azure Wings which like a canopy

10  Bends over thy immortal Head in which Eternity dwells

Albion beloved Land; I see thy mountains & thy hills

And valleys & thy pleasant Cities Holiness to the Lord

I see the Spectres of thy Dead O Emanation of Albion.

Thy Bosom white, translucent coverd with immortal gems

A sublime ornament not obscuring the outlines of beauty

Terrible to behold for thy extreme beauty & perfection

Twelve-fold here all the Tribes of Israel I behold

Upon the Holy Land: I see the River of Life & Tree of Life

I see the New Jerusalem descending out of Heaven

20  Between thy Wings of gold & silver featherd immortal

Clear as the rainbow, as the cloud of the Suns tabernacle

Thy Reins coverd with Wings translucent sometimes covering

And sometimes spread abroad reveal the flames of holiness

Which like a robe covers: & like a Veil of Seraphim

In flaming fire unceasing burns from Eternity to Eternity

Twelvefold I there behold Israel in her Tents

A Pillar of a Cloud by day: a Pillar of fire by night

Guides them: there I behold Moab & Ammon & Amalek

There Bells of silver round thy knees living articulate

30  Comforting sounds of love & harmony & on thy feet

Sandals of gold & pearl, & Egypt & Assyria before me

The Isles of Javan, Philistea, Tyre and Lebanon

Thus Los sings upon his Watch walking from Furnace to Furnace.

He siezes his Hammer every hour, flames surround him as

He beats: seas roll beneath his feet, tempests muster

Arou\[n\]d his head, the thick hail stones stand ready to obey

His voice in the black cloud, his Sons labour in thunders

At his Furnaces; his Daughters at their Looms sing woes\[.\]

His Emanation separates in milky fibres agonizing

40  Among the golden Looms of Cathedron sending fibres of love

From Golgonooza with sweet visions for Jerusalem, wanderer.

Nor can any consummate bliss without being Generated

On Earth; of those whose Emanations weave the loves

Of Beulah for Jerusalem & Shiloh, in immortal Golgonooza

Concentering in the majestic form of Erin in eternal tears

Viewing the Winding Worm on the Desarts of Great Tartary

Viewing Los in his shudderings, pouring balm on his sorrows

So dread is Los’s fury, that none dare him to approach

Without becoming his Children in the Furnaces of affliction

50  And Enitharmon like a faint rainbow waved before him

Filling with Fibres from his loins which reddend with desire

Into a Globe of blood beneath his bosom trembling in darkness

Of Albions clouds, he fed it, with his tears & bitter groans

Hiding his Spectre in invisibility from the timorous Shade

Till it became a separated cloud of beauty grace & love

Among the darkness of his Furnaces dividing asunder till

She separated stood before him a lovely Female weeping

Even Enitharmon separated outside, & his Loins closed

And heal’d after the separation: his pains he soon forgot:

Lured by her beauty outside of himself in shadowy grief.

60  Two Wills they had; Two Intellects: & not as in times of old.

Silent they wanderd hand in hand like two Infants wandring

From Enion in the desarts, terrified at each others beauty

Envying each other yet desiring, in all devouring Love,

PLATE 87

Repelling weeping Enion blind & age-bent into the fourfold

Desarts. Los first broke silence & begun to utter his love

O lovely Enitharmon: I behold thy graceful forms

Moving beside me till intoxicated with the woven labyrinth

Of beauty & perfection my wild fibres shoot in veins

Of blood thro all my nervous limbs. soon overgrown in roots

I shall be closed from thy sight, sieze therefore in thy hand

The small fibres as they shoot around me draw out in pity

And let them run on the winds of thy bosom: I will fix them

10  With pulsations, we will divide them into Sons & Daughters

To live in thy Bosoms translucence as in an eternal morning

Enitharmon answerd. No\! I will sieze thy Fibres & weave

Them: not as thou wilt but as I will, for I will Create

A round Womb beneath my bosom lest I also be overwoven

With Love; be thou assured I never will be thy slave

Let Mans delight be Love; but Womans delight be Pride\[.\]

In Eden our loves were the same here they are opposite

I have Loves of my own I will weave them in Albions Spectre

Cast thou in Jerusalems shadows thy Loves\! silk of liquid

20  Rubies Jacinths Crysolites: issuing from thy Furnaces. While

Jerusalem divides thy care: while thou carest for Jerusalem

Know that I never will be thine: also thou hidest Vala

From her these fibres shoot to shut me in a Grave.

You are Albions Victim, he has set his Daughter in your path

PLATE 88

Los answerd sighing like the Bellows of his Furnaces

I care not\! the swing of my Hammer shall measure the starry round\[.\]

When in Eternity Man converses with Man they enter

Into each others Bosom \(which are Universes of delight\)

In mutual interchange, and first their Emanations meet

Surrounded by their Children, if they embrace & comingle

The Human Four-fold Forms mingle also in thunders of Intellect

But if the Emanations mingle not; with storms & agitations

Of earthquakes & consuming fires they roll apart in fear

10  For Man cannot unite with Man but by their Emanations

Which stand both Male & Female at the Gates of each Humanity

How then can I ever again be united as Man with Man

While thou my Emanation refusest my Fibres of dominion?

When Souls mingle & join thro all the Fibres of Brotherhood

Can there be any secret joy on Earth greater than this?

Enitharmon answerd: This is Womans World, nor need she any

Spectre to defend her from Man. I will Create secret places

And the masculine names of the places Merlin & Arthur.

A triple Female Tabernacle for Moral Law I weave

20  That he who loves Jesus may loathe terrified Female love

Till God himself become a Male subservient to the Female.

She spoke in scorn & jealousy, alternate torments; and

So speaking she sat down on Sussex shore singing lulling

Cadences & playing in sweet intoxication among the glistening

Fibres of Los: sending them over the Ocean eastward into

The realms of dark death; O perverse to thyself, contrarious

To thy own purposes; for when she began to weave

Shooting out in sweet pleasure her bosom in milky Love

Flowd into the aching fibres of Los, yet contending against him

30  In pride sending his Fibres over to her objects of jealousy

In the little lovely Allegoric Night of Albions Daughters

Which stretchd abroad, expanding east & west & north & south

Thro’ all the World of Erin & of Los & all their Children

A sullen smile broke from the Spectre in mockery & scorn

Knowing himself the author of their divisions & shrinkings, gratified

At their contentions, he wiped his tears he washd his visage.

The Man who respects Woman shall be despised by Woman

And deadly cunning & mean abjectness only, shall enjoy them

For I will make their places of joy & love, excrementitious\[.\]

40  Continually building, continually destroying in Family feuds

While you are under the dominion of a jealous Female

Unpermanent for ever because of love & jealousy,

You shall want all the Minute Particulars of Life

Thus joyd the Spectre in the dusky fires of Los’s Forge, eyeing

Enitharmon who at her shining Looms sings lulling cadences

While Los stood at his Anvil in wrath the victim of their love

And hate: dividing the Space of Love with brazen Compasses

In Golgonooza & in Udan-Adan & in Entuthon of Urizen.

The blow of his Hammer is Justice, the swing of his Hammer Mercy.

50  The force of Los’s Hammer is eternal Forgiveness; but

His rage or his mildness were vain, she scatterd his love on the wind

Eastward into her own Center, creating the Female Womb.

In mild Jerusalem around the Lamb of God. Loud howl

The Furnaces of Los\! I loud roll the Wheels of Enitharmon

The Four Zoa’s in all their faded majesty burst out in fury

And fire, Jerusalem took the Cup which foamd in Vala’s hand

Like the red Sun upon the mountains in the bloody day

Upon the Hermaphroditic Wine-presses of Love & Wrath.

PLATE 89

Tho divided by the Cross & Nails & Thorns & Spear

In cruelties of Rahab & Tirzah\[,\] permanent endure

A terrible indefinite Hermaphroditic form

A Wine-press of Love & Wrath double Hermaph\[r\]oditic

Twelvefold in Allegoric pomp in selfish holiness

The Pharisaion, the Grammateis, the Presbuterion,

The Archiereus, the Iereus, the Saddusaion, double

Each withoutside of the other, covering eastern heaven

Thus was the Covering Cherub reveald majestic image

10  Of Selfhood, Body put off, the Antichrist accursed

Coverd with precious stones, a Human Dragon terrible

And bright, stretchd over Europe & Asia gorgeous

In three nights he devourd the rejected corse of death

His Head dark, deadly, in its Brain incloses a reflexion

Of Eden all perverted: Egypt on the Gihon many tongued

And many mouthd: Ethiopia, Lybia, the Sea of Rephaim

Minute Particulars in slavery I behold among the brick-kilns

Disorganiz’d, & there is Pharoh in his iron Court:

And the Dragon of the River & the Furnaces of iron.

20  Outwoven from Thames & Tweed & Severn awful streams

Twelve ridges of Stone frown over all the Earth in tyrant pride

Frown over each River stupendous Works of Albions Druid Sons

And Albions Forests of Oaks coverd the Earth from Pole to Pole

His Bosom wide reflects Moab & Ammon, on the River

Pison, since calld Arnon, there is Heshbon beautiful

The Rocks of Rabbath on the Arnon & the Fish-pools of Heshbon

Whose currents flow into the Dead Sea by Sodom & Gomorra

Above his Head high arching Wings black filld with Eyes

Spring upon iron sinews from the Scapulae & Os Humeri.

30  There Israel in bondage to his Generalizing Gods

Molech & Chemosh, & in his left breast is Philistea

In Druid Temples over the whole Earth with Victims Sacrifice,

From Gaza to Damascus Tyre & Sidon & the Gods

Of Javan thro the Isles of Grecia & all Europes Kings

Where Hiddekel pursues his course among the rocks

Two Wings spring from his ribs of brass, starry, black as night

But translucent their blackness as the dazling of gems

His Loins inclose Babylon on Euphrates beautiful

And Rome in sweet Hesperia, there Israel scatterd abroad

40  In martyrdoms & slavery I behold: ah vision of sorrow\!

Inclosd by eyeless Wings, glowing with fire as the iron

Heated in the Smiths forge, but cold the wind of their dread fury

But in the midst of a devouring Stomach, Jerusalem

Hidden within the Covering Cherub as in a Tabernacle

Of threefold workmanship in allegoric delusion & woe\[.\]

There the Seven Kings of Canaan & Five Baalim of Philistea

Sihon & Og the Anakim & Emim, Nephilim & Gibborim

From Babylon to Rome & the Wings spread from Japan

Where the Red Sea terminates the World of Generation & Death

50  To Irelands farthest rocks where Giants builded their Causeway

Into the Sea of Rephaim, but the Sea oerwhelmd them all.

A Double Female now appeard within the Tabernacle,

Religion hid in War, a Dragon red & hidden Harlot

Each within other, but without a Warlike Mighty-one

Of dreadful power, sitting upon Horeb pondering dire

And mighty preparations mustering multitudes innumerable

Of warlike sons among the sands of Midian & Aram

For multitudes of those who sleep in Alla descend

Lured by his warlike symphonies of tabret pipe & harp

60  Burst the bottoms of the Graves & Funeral Arks of Beulah

Wandering in that unknown Night beyond the silent Grave

They become One with the Antichrist & are absorbd in him

PLATE 90

The Feminine separates from the Masculine & both from Man,

Ceasing to be His Emanations, Life to Themselves assuming:

And while they circumscribe his Brain, & while they circumscribe

His Heart, & while they circumscribe his Loins: a Veil & Net

Of Veins of red Blood grows around them like a scarlet robe,

Covering them from the sight of Man like the woven Veil of Sleep

Such as the Flowers of Beulah weave to be their Funeral Mantles

But dark\! opake\! tender to touch, & painful\! & agonizing

To the embrace of love, & to the mingling of soft fibres

10  Of tender affection, that no more the Masculine mingles

With the Feminine, but the Sublime is shut out from the Pathos

In howling torment, to build stone walls of separation, compelling

The Pathos, to weave curtains of hiding secresy from the torment.

Bowen & Conwenna stood on Skiddaw cutting the Fibres

Of Benjamin from Chesters River: loud the River; loud the Mersey

And the Ribble, thunder into the Irish sea, as the Twelve Sons

Of Albion drank & imbibed the Life & eternal Form of Luvah

Cheshire & Lancashire & Westmoreland groan in anguish

As they cut the fibres from the Rivers he sears them with hot

Iron of his Forge & fixes them into Bones of chalk & Rock

20  Conwenna sat above: with solemn cadences she drew

Fibres of life out from the Bones into her golden Loom

Hand had his Furnace on Highgate heights & it reachd

To Brockley Hills across the Thames: he with double Boadicea

In cruel pride cut Reuben apart from the Hills of Surrey

Comingling with Luvah & with the Sepulcher of Luvah

For the Male is a Furnace of beryll: the Female is a golden Loom

Los cries: No Individual ought to appropriate to Himself

Or to his Emanation, any of the Universal Characteristics

30  Of David or of Eve, of the Woman, or of the Lord.

Of Reuben or of Benjamin, of Joseph or Judah or Levi\[.\]

Those who dare appropriate to themselves Universal Attributes

Are the Blasphemous Selfhoods & must be broken asunder\[.\]

A Vegetated Christ & a Virgin Eve, are the Hermaphroditic

Blasphemy, by his Maternal Birth he is that Evil-One

And his Maternal Humanity must be put off Eternally

Lest the Sexual Generation swallow up Regeneration

Come Lord Jesus take on thee the Satanic Body of Holiness

So Los cried in the Valleys of Middlesex in the Spirit of Prophecy

40  While in Selfhood Hand & Hyle & Bowen & Skofeld appropriate

The Divine Names: seeking to Vegetate the Divine Vision

In a corporeal & ever dying Vegetation & Corruption

Mingling with Luvah in One, they become One Great Satan

Loud scream the Daughters of Albion beneath the Tongs & Hammer

Dolorous are their lamentations in the burning Forge

They drink Reuben & Benjamin as the iron drinks the fire

They are red hot with cruelty: raving along the Banks of Thames

And on Tyburns Brook among the howling Victims in loveliness

While Hand & Hyle condense the Little-ones & erect them into

50  A mighty Temple even to the stars: but they Vegetate

Beneath Los’s Hammer, that Life may not be blotted out.

For Los said: When the Individual appropriates Universality

He divides into Male & Female: & when the Male & Female,

Appropriate Individuality, they become an Eternal Death.

Hermaphroditic worshippers of a God of cruelty & law\!

Your Slaves & Captives; you compell to worship a God of Mercy.

These are the Demonstrations of Los, & the blows of my mighty Hammer

So Los spoke. And the Giants of Albion terrified & ashamed

With Los’s thunderous Words, began to build trembling rocking Stones

60  For his Words roll in thunders & lightnings among the Temples

Terrified rocking to & fro upon the earth, & sometimes

Resting in a Circle in Malden or in Strathness or Dura.

Plotting to devour Albion & Los the friend of Albion

Denying in private: mocking God & Eternal Life: & in Public

Collusion, calling themselves Deists, Worshipping the Maternal

Humanity; calling it Nature, and Natural Religion

But still the thunder of Los peals loud & thus the thunder’s cry

These beautiful Witchcrafts of Albion, are gratifyd by Cruelty

PLATE 91

It is easier to forgive an Enemy than to forgive a Friend:

The man who permits you to injure him, deserves your vengeance:

He also will recieve it; go Spectre\! obey my most secret desire:

Which thou knowest without my speaking: Go to these Fiends of Righteousness

Tell them to obey their Humanities, & not pretend Holiness;

When they are murderers: as far as my Hammer & Anvil permit

Go, tell them that the Worship of God, is honouring his gifts

In other men: & loving the greatest men best, each according

To his Genius: which is the Holy Ghost in Man; there is no other

10  God, than that God who is the intellectual fountain of Humanity;

He who envies or calumniates: which is murder & cruelty,

Murders the Holy-one: Go tell them this & overthrow their cup,

Their bread, their altar-table, their incense & their oath:

Their marriage & their baptism, their burial & consecration:

I have tried to make friends by corporeal gifts but have only

Made enemies: I never made friends but by spiritual gifts;

By severe contentions of friendship & the burning fire of thought.

He who would see the Divinity must see him in his Children

One first, in friendship & love; then a Divine Family, & in the midst

20  Jesus will appear; so he who wishes to see a Vision; a perfect Whole

Must see it in its Minute Particulars; Organized & not as thou

O Fiend of Righteousness pretendest; thine is a Disorganized

And snowy cloud: brooder of tempests & destructive War.

You smile with pomp & rigor: you talk of benevolence & virtue:

I act with benevolence & Virtue & get murderd time after time:

You accumulate Particulars, & murder by analyzing, that you

May take the aggregate; & you call the aggregate Moral Law:

And you call that Swelld & bloated Form; a Minute Particular.

But General Forms have their vitality in Particulars: & every

30  Particular is a Man; a Divine Member of the Divine Jesus.

So Los cried at his Anvil in the horrible darkness weeping:

The Spectre builded stupendous Works, taking the Starry Heavens

Like to a curtain & folding them according to his will

Repeating the Smaragdine Table of Hermes to draw Los down

Into the Indefinite, refusing to believe without demonstration\[.\]

Los reads the Stars of Albion\! the Spectre reads the Voids

Between the Stars: among the arches of Albions Tomb sublime

Rolling the Sea in rocky paths: forming Leviathan

And Behemoth: the War by Sea enormous & the War

40  By Land astounding: erecting pillars in the deepest Hell,

To reach the heavenly arches; Los beheld undaunted furious

His heavd Hammer; he swung it round & at one blow,

In unpitying ruin driving down the pyramids of pride

Smiting the Spectre on his Anvil & the integuments of his Eye

And Ear unbinding in dire pain, with many blows,

Of strict severity self-subduing, & with many tears labouring.

Then he sent forth the Spectre all his pyramids were grains

Of sand & his pillars: dust on the flys wing: & his starry

Heavens; a moth of gold & silver mocking his anxious grasp

50  Thus Los alterd his Spectre & every Ratio of his Reason

He alterd time after time, with dire pain & many tears

Till he had completely divided him into a separate space.

Terrified Los sat to behold trembling & weeping & howling

I care not whether a Man is Good or Evil; all that I care

Is whether he is a Wise Man or a Fool. Go\! put off Holiness

And put on Intellect: or my thundrous Hammer shall drive thee

To wrath which thou condemnest: till thou obey my voice

So Los terrified cries: trembling & weeping & howling\! Beholding

PLATE 92

What do I see? The Briton Saxon Roman Norman amalgamating

In my Furnaces into One Nation the English: & taking refuge

In the Loins of Albion. The Canaanite united with the fugitive

Hebrew, whom she divided into Twelve, & sold into Egypt

Then scatterd the Egyptian & Hebrew to the four Winds:

This sinful Nation Created in our Furnaces & Looms is Albion

So Los spoke. Enitharmon answerd in great terror in Lambeths Vale

The Poets Song draws to its period & Enitharmon is no more.

For if he be that Albion I can never weave him in my Looms

10  But when he touches the first fibrous thread, like filmy dew

My Looms will be no more & I annihilate vanish for ever

Then thou wilt Create another Female according to thy Will.

 Los answerd swift as the shuttle of gold. Sexes must vanish & cease

To be, when Albion arises from his dread repose O lovely Enitharmon:

When all their Crimes, their Punishments their Accusations of Sin:

All their Jealousies Revenges, Murders, hidings of Cruelty in Deceit

Appear only in the Outward Spheres of Visionary Space and Time,

In the shadows of Possibility by Mutual Forgiveness forevermore

And in the Vision & in the Prophecy, that we may Foresee & Avoid

20  The terrors of Creation & Redemption & Judgment. Beholding them

Displayd in the Emanative Visions of Canaan in Jerusalem & in Shiloh

And in the Shadows of Remembrance, & in the Chaos of the Spectre

Amalek, Edom, Egypt, Moab, Ammon, Ashur, Philistea, around Jerusalem

Where the Druids reard their Rocky Circles to make permanent Remembrance

Of Sin, & the Tree of Good & Evil sprang from the Rocky Circle & Snake

Of the Druid, along the Valley of Rephaim from Camberwell to Golgotha

And framed the Mundane Shell Cavernous in Length Bredth & Highth

PLATE 93

Enitharmon heard. She raisd her head like the mild Moon

O Rintrah\! O Palamabron\! What are your dire & awful purposes

Enitharmons name is nothing before you: you forget all my Love\!

The Mothers love of obedience is forgotten & you seek a Love

Of the pride of dominion, that will Divorce Ocalythron & Elynittria

Upon East Moor in Derbyshire & along the Valleys of Cheviot

Could you Love me Rintrah, if you Pride not in my Love

As Reuben found Mandrakes in the field & gave them to his Mother

Pride meets with Pride upon the Mountains in the stormy day

10  In that terrible Day of Rintrahs Plow & of Satans driving the Team.

Ah\! then I heard my little ones weeping along the Valley:

Ah\! then I saw my beloved ones fleeing from my Tent

Merlin was like thee Rintrah among the Giants of Albion

Judah was like Palamabron: O Simeon\! O Levi\! ye fled away

How can I hear my little ones weeping along the Valley

Or how upon the distant Hills see my beloveds Tents.

Then Los again took up his speech as Enitharmon ceast

Fear not my Sons this Waking Death, he is become One with me

Behold him here\! We shall not Die\! we shall be united in Jesus.

20  Will you suffer this Satan this Body of Doubt that Seems but Is Not

To occupy the very threshold of Eternal Life, if Bacon, Newton, Locke,

Deny a Conscience in Man & the Communion of Saints & Angels

Contemning the Divine Vision & Fruition, Worshiping the Deus

Of the Heathen, The God of This World, & the Goddess Nature

Mystery Babylon the Great, The Druid Dragon & hidden Harlot\[,\]

Is it not that Signal of the Morning which was told us in the Beginning

Thus they converse upon Mam-Tor, the Graves thunder under their feet

PLATE 94

Albion cold lays on his Rock: storms & snows beat round him.

Beneath the Furnaces & the starry Wheels & the Immortal Tomb

Howling winds cover him: roaring seas dash furious against him

In the deep darkness broad lightnings glare long thunders roll

The weeds of Death inwrap his hands & feet blown incessant

And washd incessant by the for-ever restless sea-waves foaming abroad

Upon the white Rock. England a Female Shadow as deadly damps

Of the Mines of Cornwall & Derbyshire lays upon his bosom heavy

Moved by the wind in volumes of thick cloud returning folding round

10  His loins & bosom unremovable by swelling storms & loud rending

Of enraged thunders. Around them the Starry Wheels of their Giant Sons

Revolve: & over them the Furnaces of Los & the Immortal Tomb around

Erin sitting in the Tomb, to watch them unceasing night and day

And the Body of Albion was closed apart from all Nations.

Over them the famishd Eagle screams on boney Wings and around

Them howls the Wolf of famine deep heaves the Ocean black thundering

Around the wormy Garments of Albion: then pausing in deathlike silence

Time was Finished\! The Breath Divine Breathed over Albion

Beneath the Furnaces & starry Wheels and in the Immortal Tomb

20  And England who is Brittannia awoke, from Death on Albions bosom

She awoke pale & cold she fainted seven times on the Body of Albion

O pitious Sleep O pitious Dream\! O God O God awake I have slain

In Dreams of Chastity & Moral Law I have Murdered Albion\! Ah\!

In Stone-henge & on London Stone & in the Oak Groves of Malden

I have Slain him in my Sleep with the Knife of the Druid O England

O all ye Nations of the Earth behold ye the Jealous Wife

The Eagle & the Wolf & Monkey & Owl & the King & Priest were there

PLATE 95

Her voice pierc’d Albions clay cold ear. he moved upon the Rock.

The Breath Divine went forth upon the morning hills, Albion mov’d

Upon the Rock, he opend his eyelids in pain; in pain he mov’d

His stony members, he saw England. Ah\! shall the Dead live again

 The Breath Divine went forth over the morning hills Albion rose

In anger: the wrath of God breaking bright flaming on all sides around

His awful limbs: into the Heavens he walked clothed in flames

Loud thundring, with broad flashes of flaming lightning & pillars

Of fire, speaking the Words of Eternity in Human Forms, in direful

10  Revolutions of Action & Passion, thro the Four Elements on all sides

Surrounding his awful Members. Thou seest the Sun in heavy clouds

Struggling to rise above the Mountains, in his burning hand

He takes his Bow, then chooses out his arrows of flaming gold

Murmuring the Bowstring breathes with ardor\! clouds roll round the

Horns of the wide Bow, loud sounding winds sport on the mountain brows

Compelling Urizen to his Furrow; & Tharmas to his Sheepfold;

And Luvah to his Loom: Urthona he beheld mighty labouring at

His Anvil, in the Great Spectre Los unwearied labouring & weeping

Therefore the Sons of Eden praise Urthonas Spectre in songs

Because he kept the Divine Vision in time of trouble.

20  As the Sun & Moon lead forward the Visions of Heaven & Earth

England who is Brittannia enterd Albions bosom rejoicing,

Rejoicing in his indignation\! adoring his wrathful rebuke.

She who adores not your frowns will only loathe your smiles

PLATE 96

As the Sun & Moon lead forward the Visions of Heaven & Earth

England who is Brittannia entered Albions bosom rejoicing

Then Jesus appeared standing by Albion as the Good Shepherd

By the lost Sheep that he hath found & Albion knew that it

Was the Lord the Universal Humanity, & Albion saw his Form

A Man, & they conversed as Man with Man, in Ages of Eternity

And the Divine Appearance was the likeness & similitude of Los

Albion said. O Lord what can I do\! my Selfhood cruel

Marches against thee deceitful from Sinai & from Edom

10  Into the Wilderness of Judah to meet thee in his pride

I behold the Visions of my deadly Sleep of Six Thousand Years

Dazling around thy skirts like a Serpent of precious stones & gold

I know it is my Self: O my Divine Creator & Redeemer

Jesus replied Fear not Albion unless I die thou canst not live

But if I die I shall arise again & thou with me

This is Friendship & Brotherhood without it Man Is Not

So Jesus spoke: the Covering Cherub coming on in darkness

Overshadowd them & Jesus said Thus do Men in Eternity

One for another to put off by forgiveness, every sin

20  Albion replyd. Cannot Man exist without Mysterious

Offering of Self for Another, is this Friendship & Brotherhood

I see thee in the likeness & similitude of Los my Friend

Jesus said. Wouldest thou love one who never died

For thee or ever die for one who had not died for thee

And if God dieth not for Man & giveth not himself

Eternally for Man Man could not exist\! for Man is Love:

As God is Love: every kindness to another is a little Death

In the Divine Image nor can Man exist but by Brotherhood

So saying the Cloud overshadowing divided them asunder

30  Albion stood in terror: not for himself but for his Friend

Divine, & Self was lost in the contemplation of faith

And wonder at the Divine Mercy & at Los’s sublime honour

Do I sleep amidst danger to Friends\! O my Cities & Counties

Do you sleep\! rouze up\! rouze up. Eternal Death is abroad

So Albion spoke & threw himself into the Furnaces of affliction

All was a Vision, all a Dream: the Furnaces became

Fountains of Living Waters flowing from the Humanity Divine

And all the Cities of Albion rose from their Slumbers, and All

The Sons & Daughters of Albion on soft clouds Waking from Sleep

40  Soon all around remote the Heavens burnt with flaming fires

And Urizen & Luvah & Tharmas & Urthona arose into

Albions Bosom: Then Albion stood before Jesus in the Clouds

Of Heaven Fourfold among the Visions of God in Eternity

PLATE 97

Awake\! Awake Jerusalem\! O lovely Emanation of Albion

Awake and overspread all Nations as in Ancient Time

For lo\! the Night of Death is past and the Eternal Day

Appears upon our Hills: Awake Jerusalem, and come away

So spake the Vision of Albion & in him so spake in my hearing

The Universal Father Then Albion stretchd his hand into Infinitude,

And took his Bow. Fourfold the Vision for bright beaming Urizen

Layd his hand on the South & took a breathing Bow of carved Gold

Luvah his hand stretch’d to the East & bore a Silver Bow bright shining

10  Tharmas Westward a Bow of Brass pure flaming richly wrought

Urthona Northward in thick storms a Bow of Iron terrible thundering.

And the Bow is a Male & Female & the Quiver of the Arrows of Love,

Are the Children of this Bow: a Bow of Mercy & Loving-kindness: laying

Open the hidden Heart in Wars of mutual Benevolence Wars of Love

And the Hand of Man grasps firm between the Male & Female Loves

And he Clothed himself in Bow & Arrows in awful state Fourfold

In the midst of his Twenty-eight Cities each with his Bow breathing

PLATE 98

Then each an Arrow flaming from his Quiver fitted carefully

They drew fourfold the unreprovable String, bending thro the wide Heavens

The horned Bow Fourfold, loud sounding flew the flaming Arrow fourfold

Murmuring the Bow-string breathes with ardor. Clouds roll round the horns

Of the wide Bow, loud sounding Winds sport on the Mountains brows:

The Druid Spectre was Annihilate loud thundring rejoicing terrific vanishing

Fourfold Annihilation & at the clangor of the Arrows of Intellect

The innumerable Chariots of the Almighty appeard in Heaven

And Bacon & Newton & Locke, & Milton & Shakspear & Chaucer

10  A Sun of blood red wrath surrounding heaven on all sides around

Glorious incompreh\[en\]sible by Mortal Man & each Chariot was Sexual Threefold

And every Man stood Fourfold, each Four Faces had. One to the West

One toward the East One to the South One to the North, the Horses Fourfold

And the dim Chaos brightend beneath, above, around\! Eyed as the Peacock

According to the Human Nerves of Sensation, the Four Rivers of the Water of Life

South stood the Nerves of the Eye. East in Rivers of bliss the Nerves of the

Expansive Nostrils West, flowd the Parent Sense the Tongue. North stood

The labyrinthine Ear. Circumscribing & circumcising the excrementitious

Husk & Covering into Vacuum evaporating revealing the lineaments of Man

20  Driving outward the Body of Death in an Eternal Death & Resurrection

Awaking it to Life among the Flowers of Beulah rejoicing in Unity

In the Four Senses in the Outline the Circumference & Form, for ever

In Forgiveness of Sins which is Self Annihilation, it is the Covenant of Jehovah

The Four Living Creatures Chariots of Humanity Divine Incomprehensible

In beautiful Paradises expand These are the Four Rivers of Paradise

And the Four Faces of Humanity fronting the Four Cardinal Points

Of Heaven going forward forward irresistible from Eternity to Eternity

And they conversed together in Visionary forms dramatic which bright

Redounded from their Tongues in thunderous majesty, in Visions

30  In new Expanses, creating exemplars of Memory and of Intellect

Creating Space, Creating Time according to the wonders Divine

Of Human Imagination, throughout all the Three Regions immense

Of Childhood, Manhood & Old Age\[;\] & the all tremendous unfathomable Non Ens

Of Death was seen in regenerations terrific or complacent varying

According to the subject of discourse & every Word & Every Character

Was Human according to the Expansion or Contraction, the Translucence or

Opakeness of Nervous fibres such was the variation of Time & Space

Which vary according as the Organs of Perception vary & they walked

To & fro in Eternity as One Man reflecting each in each & clearly seen

40  And seeing: according to fitness & order. And I heard Jehovah speak

Terrific from his Holy Place & saw the Words of the Mutual Covenant Divine

On Chariots of gold & jewels with Living Creatures starry & flaming

With every Colour, Lion, Tyger, Horse, Elephant, Eagle Dove, Fly, Worm,

And the all wondrous Serpent clothed in gems & rich array Humanize

In the Forgiveness of Sins according to the Covenant of Jehovah. They Cry

Where is the Covenant of Priam, the Moral Virtues of the Heathen

Where is the Tree of Good & Evil that rooted beneath the cruel heel

Of Albions Spectre the Patriarch Druid\! where are all his Human Sacrifices

For Sin in War & in the Druid Temples of the Accuser of Sin: beneath

50  The Oak Groves of Albion that coverd the whole Earth beneath his Spectre

Where are the Kingdoms of the World & all their glory that grew on Desolation

The Fruit of Albions Poverty Tree when the Triple Headed Gog-Magog Giant

Of Albion Taxed the Nations into Desolation & then gave the Spectrous Oath

Such is the Cry from all the Earth from the Living Creatures of the Earth

And from the great City of Golgonooza in the Shadowy Generation

And from the Thirty-two Nations of the Earth among the living Creatures

PLATE 99

All Human Forms identified even Tree Metal Earth & Stone, all

Human Forms identified, living going forth & returning wearied

Into the Planetary lives of Years Months Days & Hours reposing

And then Awaking into his Bosom in the Life of Immortality.

And I heard the Name of their Emanations they are named Jerusalem

                 The End of The Song of Jerusalem



## ********THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL





   \[PRELIMINARY SECTIONS\]

There is not one Moral Virtue that Jesus Inculcated but Plato & Cicero did Inculcate before him what then did Christ Inculcate. Forgiveness of Sins This alone is the Gospel & this is the Life & Immortality brought to light by Jesus. Even the Covenant of Jehovah, which is This If you forgive one another your Trespessas so shall Jehovah forgive you That he himself may dwell among you but if you Avenge you Murder the Divine Image & he cannot dwell among you \[*by his*\] because you Murder him he

10   arises Again & you deny that he is Arisen & are blind to Spirit

\*

What can this Gospel of Jesus be  
What Life & Immortality  
What was it that he brought to Light  
That Plato & Cicero did not write  
The Heathen Deities wrote them all  
These Moral Virtues great & small  
What is the Accusation of Sin  
But Moral Virtues deadly Gin  
The Moral Virtues in their Pride

10     Did oer the World triumphant ride

In Wars & Sacrifice for Sin  
And Souls to Hell ran trooping in  
The Accuser Holy God of All  
This Pharisaic Worldly Ball  
Amidst them in his Glory Beams  
Upon the Rivers & the Streams   
Then Jesus rose & said to \[men\] Me  
Thy Sins are all forgiven thee  
Loud Pilate Howld loud Caiphas Yelld  
When they the Gospel Light beheld

20     \[*Jerusalem he said to me*\]

It was when Jesus said to Me  
Thy Sins are all forgiven thee  
The Christian trumpets loud proclaim  
Thro all the World in Jesus name  
Mutual forgiveness of each Vice  
And oped the Gates of Paradise  
The Moral Virtues in Great fear  
Formed the Cross & Nails & Spear

30     And the Accuser standing by

Cried out Crucify Crucify  
Our Moral Virtues neer can be  
Nor Warlike pomp & Majesty  
For Moral Virtues all begin  
In the Accusations of Sin  
And \[*Moral*\] all the Heroic Virtues \[*all*\] End  
In destroying the Sinners Friend  
Am I not Lucifer the Great  
And you my daughters in Great State

40     The fruit of my Mysterious Tree

Of Good & Evil & Misery  
And Death & Hell which now begin  
On every one who Forgives Sin

\*

I This to come first

If Moral Virtue was Christianity  
Christs Pretensions were all Vanity  
And Caiphas & Pilate Men  
\[*Of Moral*\] Praise Worthy & the Lions Den  
And not the Sheepfold Allegories  
Of God & Heaven & their Glories   
The Moral Christian is the Cause  
Of the Unbeliever & his Laws  
The Roman Virtues Warlike Fame

10     Take Jesus & Jehovahs Name.

For what is Antichrist but those  
Who against Sinners Heaven close  
With Iron bars in Virtuous State  
And Rhadamanthus at the Gate

\*

Was Jesus Born of a Virgin Pure  
With narrow Soul & looks demure  
If he intended to take on Sin  
The Mother should an Harlot been  
Just such a one as Magdalen  
With seven devils in her Pen  
Or were Jew Virgins still more Curst  
And more sucking devils nurst  
Or what was it which he took on

10     That he might bring Salvation

A Body subject to be Tempted  
From neither pain nor grief Exempted  
Or such a body as might not feel  
The passions that with Sinners deal  
Yes but they say he never fell  
Ask Caiaphas for he can tell  
He mockd the Sabbath & he mockd  
The Sabbaths God & he unlockd  
The Evil spirits from their Shrines

20     And turnd Fishermen to Divines

\[*End*\] Oerturnd the Tent of Secret Sins  
& its Golden cords & Pins  
Tis the Bloody Shrine of War  
Pinnd around from Star to Star  
Halls of Justice hating Vice  
Where the Devil Combs his Lice  
He turnd the devils into Swine  
That he might tempt the Jews to Dine   
Since which a Pig has got a look  
That for a Jew may be mistook

30     Obey your Parents what says he

Woman what have I to do with thee  
No Earthly Parents I confess  
I am doing my Fathers Business  
He scornd \[*his*\] Earths Parents scornd \[*his*\] Earths God  
And mockd the one & the others Rod  
His Seventy Disciples sent  
Against Religion & Government  
They by the Sword of Justice fell  
And him their Cruel Murderer tell

40     He left his Fathers trade to roam

A wandring Vagrant without Home  
And thus he others labour stole  
That he might live above Controll  
The Publicans & Harlots he  
Selected for his Company  
And from the Adulteress turnd away  
Gods righteous Law that lost its Prey

\[NOTEBOOK SECTIONS\]

The Vision of Christ that thou dost see  
Is my Visions Greatest Enemy  
Thine has a great hook nose like thine  
Mine has a snub nose like to mine  
Thine is the friend of All Mankind  
Mine speaks in parables to the Blind  
Thine loves the same world that mine hates  
Thy Heaven doors are my Hell Gates  
Socrates taught what Melitus

10     Loathd as a Nations bitterest Curse

And Caiphas was in his own Mind  
A benefactor to Mankind  
Both read the Bible day & night  
But thou readst black where I read white

\*

Was Jesus Chaste or did he  
Give any Lessons of Chastity  
The morning blushd fiery red  
Mary was found in Adulterous bed  
Earth groand beneath & Heaven above  
Trembled at discovery of Love  
Jesus was sitting in Moses Chair  
They brought the trembling Woman There  
Moses commands she be stoned to death

10     What was the \[*words*\] sound of Jesus breath

He laid His hand on Moses Law  
The Ancient Heavens in Silent Awe  
Writ with Curses from Pole to Pole  
All away began to roll  
The Earth trembling & Naked lay  
In secret bed of Mortal Clay  
On Sinai felt the hand Divine  
Putting back the bloody shrine  
And she heard the breath of God

20     As she heard by Edens flood

Good & Evil are no more  
Sinais trumpets cease to roar  
Cease finger of God to write  
The Heavens are not clean in thy Sight  
Thou art Good & thou Alone  
Nor may the sinner cast one stone  
To be Good only is to be  
A \[*god*\] Devil or else a Pharisee  
Thou Angel of the Presence Divine

30     That didst create this Body of Mine

Wherefore has thou writ these Laws  
And Created Hells dark jaws  
My Presence I will take from thee  
A Cold Leper thou shalt be  
Tho thou wast so pure & bright  
That Heaven was Impure in thy Sight  
Tho thy Oath turnd Heaven Pale  
Tho thy Covenant built Hells Jail

Tho thou didst all to Chaos roll

40     With the Serpent for its soul

Still the breath Divine does move  
And the breath Divine is Love  
Mary Fear Not Let me see  
The Seven Devils that torment thee  
Hide not from my Sight thy Sin  
That forgiveness thou maist win  
Has no Man Condemned thee  
No Man Lord\! then what is he  
Who shall Accuse thee. Come Ye forth

50     Fallen Fiends of Heavenly birth

That have forgot your Ancient love  
And driven away my trembling Dove  
You shall bow before her feet  
You shall lick the dust for Meat  
And tho you cannot Love but Hate  
Shall be beggars at Loves Gate  
What was thy love Let me see it  
Was it love or Dark Deceit  
Love too long from Me has fled.

60     Twas dark deceit to Earn my bread

Twas Covet or twas Custom or  
\[*Twas*\] Some trifle not worth caring for  
That they may call a \[*crime*\] shame & Sin  
\[*The*\] Loves temple \[*where*\] that God dwelleth in  
And hide in secret Hidden Shrine  
The Naked Human form divine  
And render that a Lawless thing  
On which the Soul Expands its wing  
But this O Lord this was my Sin

70     When first I let these Devils in

In dark pretence to Chastity  
Blaspheming Love blaspheming thee  
Thence Rose Secret Adulteries  
And thence did Covet also rise  
My sin thou hast forgiven me  
Canst thou forgive my Blasphemy

Canst thou return to this dark Hell  
And in my burning bosom dwell  
And canst thou die that I may live

80     And canst thou Pity & forgive

Then Rolld the shadowy Man away  
From the Limbs of Jesus to make them his prey  
An Ever devo\[u\]ring appetite  
Glittering with festering Venoms bright  
Crying \[*Ive found*\] Crucify this cause of distress  
\[*You*\] Who dont keep the secrets of Holiness  
All Mental Powers by Diseases we bind  
But he heals the Deaf & the Dumb & the Blind  
Whom God has afflicted for Secret Ends

90     He comforts & Heals & calls them Friends

But when Jesus was Crucified  
Then was perfected his glittring pride  
In three Nights he devourd his prey  
And still he devours the Body of Clay  
For dust & Clay is the Serpents meat  
Which never was made for Man to Eat

\*

Seeing this False Christ In fury & Passion  
I made my Voice heard all over the Nation  
What are those &c

\*

Did Jesus teach doubt or did he  
Give any lessons of Philosophy  
Charge Visionaries with decieving  
Or call Men wise for not Believing

\*

Was Jesus gentle or did he  
Give any marks of Gentility  
When twelve years old he ran away  
And left his Parents in dismay  
When after three days sorrow found  
Loud as Sinai’s trumpet sound  
No Earthly Parents I confess  
My Heavenly Fathers business  
Ye understand not what I say

10     And angry force me to obey

Obedience is a duty then  
And favour gains with God & Men  
John from the Wilderness loud cried  
Satan gloried in his Pride  
Come said Satan come away  
Ill soon see if youll obey  
John for disobedience bled  
But you can turn the stones to bread  
Gods high king & Gods high Priest

20     Shall Plant their Glories in your breast

If Caiaphas you will obey  
If Herod you with bloody Prey  
Feed with the Sacrifice & be  
Obedient fall down worship me  
Thunders & lightnings broke around  
And Jesus voice in thunders sound  
Thus I sieze the Spiritual Prey  
Ye smiters with disease make way  
I come Your King & God to sieze

30     Is God a Smiter with disease

The God of this World raged in vain  
He bound Old Satan in his Chain  
And bursting forth \[*with*\] his furious ire  
Became a Chariot of fire  
Throughout the land he took his course  
And traced diseases to their source  
He cursd the Scribe & Pharisee  
Trampling down Hipocrisy  
Where eer his Chariot took its way

40     There Gates of Death let in the day

Broke down from every Chain & Bar  
And Satan in his Spiritual War 

Dragd at his Chariot wheels loud howld  
The God of this World louder rolld  
The Chariot Wheels & louder still  
His voice was heard from Zions hill  
And in his hand the Scourge shone bright  
He scourgd the Merchant Canaanite  
From out the Temple of his Mind

50     And in his Body tight does bind

Satan & all his Hellish Crew  
And thus with wrath he did subdue  
The Serpent Bulk of Natures dross  
Till he had naild it to the Cross  
He took on Sin in the Virgins Womb  
\[*And on the Cross he Seald its doom*\]  
And put it off on the Cross & Tomb  
To be Worshipd by the Church of Rome

\*

Was Jesus Humble or did he  
Give any proofs of Humility  
When but a Child he ran away  
And left his Parents in dismay  
When they had wanderd three days long  
These were the words upon his Tongue  
No Earthly Parents I confess  
I am doing my Fathers business  
When the rich learned Pharisee

10     Came to consult him secretly

He was too Proud to take a bribe  
He spoke with authority not like a Scribe  
Upon his heart with Iron pen  
He wrote Ye must be born again  
He says with most consummate Art  
Follow me I am meek & lowly of heart  
As that is the only way to Escape  
The Misers net & the Gluttons trap  
He who loves his Enemies hates his Friends

20     This is surely not what Jesus intends

He must mean the meer love of Civility  
And so he must mean concerning Humility  
But he acts with triumphant honest pride  
And this is the Reason Jesus died  
If he had been \[*the*\] Antichrist Creeping Jesus  
Hed have done any thing to please us  
Gone sneaking into the Synagogues  
And not used the Elders & Priests like Dogs  
But humble as a Lamb or an Ass

30     Obey himself to Caiaphas

God wants not Man to humble himself  
This is the Trick of the Ancient Elf  
Humble toward God, Haughty toward Man  
This is the Race that Jesus ran  
And when he humbled himself to God  
Then descended the cruel rod  
\[*Why dost thou humble thyself to me*

40     *Thou Also dwelst in Eternity*\]

If thou humblest thyself thou humblest me  
Thou also dwelst in Eternity  
Thou art a Man God is no more  
Thine own Humanity learn to Adore  
And thy Revenge Abroad display  
In terrors at the Last Judgment day  
Gods Mercy & Long Suffering  
Are but the Sinner to Judgment to bring  
Thou on the Cross for them shalt pray  
\[*Whom thou shalt Torment at the Last Day*\]

50     And take Revenge at the last Day

Do what you will this Lifes a Fiction

And is made up of Contradiction

THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL

Was Jesus Humble or did he  
Give any Proofs of Humility  
Boast of high Things with Humble tone  
And give with Charity a Stone  
When but a Child he ran away  
And left his Parents in dismay  
When they had wanderd three days long  
These were the words upon his tongue  
No Earthly Parents I confess

10     I am doing my Fathers business

When the rich learned Pharisee  
Came to consult him secretly  
Upon his heart with Iron pen  
He wrote Ye must be born again  
He was too proud to take a bribe  
He spoke with authority not like a Scribe  
He says with most consummate Art  
Follow me I am meek & lowly of heart  
As that is the only way to escape

20     The Misers net & the Gluttons trap

What can be done with such desperate Fools  
Who follow after the Heathen Schools  
I was standing by when Jesus died  
What I calld Humility they calld Pride  
He who loves his Enemies \[*hates*\] betrays his Friends  
This surely is not what Jesus intends  
But the sneaking Pride of Heroic Schools  
And the Scribes & Pharisees Virtuous Rules  
For he acts with honest triumphant Pride

30     And this is the cause that Jesus died

He did not die with Christian Ease  
Asking pardon of his Enemies  
If he had Caiphas would forgive  
Sneaking submission can always live  
He had only to say that God was the devil  
And the devil was God like a Christian Civil  
Mild Christian regrets to the devil confess  
For affronting him thrice in the Wilderness  
He had soon been bloody Caesars Elf

40     And at last he would have been Caesar himself

Like dr Priestly & \[*Sir Isaac*\] Bacon & Newton  
Poor Spiritual Knowledge is not worth a button  
\[*As*\] For thus the Gospel Sr Isaac confutes  
God can only be known by his Attributes  
And as for the Indwelling of the Holy Ghost  
Or of Christ & his Father its all a boast  
And Pride & Vanity of the Imagination  
That disdains to follow this Worlds Fashion  
To teach doubt & Experiment

50     Certainly was not what Christ meant

What was he doing all that time  
From twelve years old to manly prime  
Was he then Idle or the Less  
About his Fathers business  
Or was his wisdom held in scorn  
Before his wrath began to burn  
In Miracles throughout the Land  
That quite unnervd Caiaphas hand  
If he had been \[*the*\] Antichrist Creeping Jesus

60     Hed have done any thing to please us

Gone sneaking into Synagogues  
And not usd the Elders & Priests like dogs  
But Humble as a Lamb or Ass  
Obeyd himself to Caiaphas  
God wants not Man to Humble himself  
This is the trick of the ancient Elf  
This is the Race that Jesus ran  
Humble to God Haughty to Man  
Cursing the Rulers before the People

70     Even to the temples highest Steeple

And when he Humbled himself to God  
Then descended the Cruel Rod  
If thou humblest thyself thou humblest me  
Thou also dwellst in Eternity  
Thou art a Man God is no more  
Thy own humanity learn to adore  
For that is my Spirit of Life  
Awake arise to Spiritual Strife  
And thy Revenge abroad display

80     In terrors at the Last Judgment day

Gods Mercy & Long Suffering  
Is but the Sinner to Judgment to bring  
Thou on the Cross for them shalt pray  
And take Revenge at the Last Day  
\[*All Corporeal lifes a/This Corporeal*  
*\(All\) lifes a fiction*  
*And is made up of Contradiction*\]

Jesus replied & thunders hurld  
I never will Pray for the World  
Once \[I\] did so when I prayd in the Garden

90     I wishd to take with me a Bodily Pardon

Can that which was of woman born  
In the absence of the Morn  
When the Soul fell into Sleep  
And Archangels round it weep  
Shooting out against the Light  
Fibres of a deadly night  
Reasoning upon its own dark Fiction  
In doubt which is Self Contradiction  
Humility is only doubt

100   And does the Sun & Moon blot out

Rooting over with thorns & stems  
The buried Soul & all its Gems.  
This Lifes dim Windows of the Soul  
Distorts the Heavens from Pole to Pole  
And leads you to Believe a Lie  
When you see with not thro the Eye  
That was born in a night to perish in a night  
When the Soul slept in the beams of Light.

\*

I am sure This Jesus will not do  
Either for Englishman or Jew



## ********FOR THE SEXES THE GATES OF PARADISE





\[PROLOGUE\]

Mutual forgiveness of each Vice  
Such are the Gates of Paradise  
Against the Accusers chief desire  
Who walked among the Stones of Fire  
Jehovahs Finger Wrote the Law

I rent the Veil where the Dead dwell

 

When weary Man enters his Cave  
He meets his Saviour in the Grave  
Some find a Female Garment there  
And some a Male, woven with care  
Lest the Sexual Garments sweet  
Should grow a devouring Winding sheet

Truly My Satan thou art but a Dunce  
And dost not know the Garment from the Man  
Every Harlot was a Virgin once  
Nor canst thou ever change Kate into Nan

Tho thou art Worshipd by the Names Divine  
Of Jesus & Jehovah: thou art still  
The Son of Morn in weary Nights decline  
The lost Travellers Dream under the Hill



## ********THE GHOST OF ABEL

A Revelation In the Visions of Jehovah

Seen by William Blake





PLATE I

To LORD BYRON in the Wilderness

What doest thou here Elijah?

Can a Poet doubt the Visions of Jehovah? Nature has  
no Outline: but Imagination has. Nature has no Tune:  
but Imagination has\! Nature has no Supernatural &  
dissolves: Imagination is Eternity

*Scene. A rocky Country. Eve fainted over the dead body  
of Abel which lays near a Grave. Adam kneels by her  
Jehovah stands above.*

JEHOVAH: Adam\!

ADAM:               I will not hear thee more thou Spiritual Voice

    Is this Death?

JEHOVAH:       Adam\!

ADAM:                      It is in vain: I will not hear thee  
    Henceforth\! Is this thy Promise that the Womans Seed

    Should bruise the Serpents head: Is this the Serpent? Ah\!

10         Seven times, O Eve thou hast fainted over the Dead. Ah\! Ah\!

*Eve revives.*

EVE: Is this the Promise of Jehovah\! O it is all a vain delusion

This Death & this Life & this Jehovah\!

JEHOVAH:                                      Woman: lift thine eyes

*A Voice is heard coming on.*

VOICE: O Earth cover not thou my Blood\! cover not thou my Blood

*Enter the Ghost of Abel.*

EVE: Thou Visionary Phantasm thou art not the real Abel.

ABEL:Among the Elohim a Human Victim I wander I am their House

Prince of the Air & our dimensions compass Zenith & Nadir

Vain is thy Covenant O Jehovah I am the Accuser & Avenger

Of Blood O Earth Cover not thou the Blood of Abel

JEHOVAH:What Vengeance dost thou require

ABEL:                                                       Life for

 Life\! Life for Life\!

20     JEHOVAH: He who shall take Cains life must also Die O Abel

And who is he? Adam wilt thou, or Eve thou do this

ADAM: It is all a Vain delusion of the all creative Imagination

Eve come away & let us not believe these vain delusions

Abel is dead & Cain slew him\! We shall also Die a Death

And then\! what then? be as poor Abel a Thought: or as

This\! O what shall I call thee Form Divine\! Father of Mercies

That appearest to my Spiritual Vision: Eve seest thou also.

EVE: I see him plainly with my Minds Eye. I see also Abel living:

Tho terribly afflicted as We also are, yet Jehovah sees him



PLATE 2

Alive & not Dead: were it not better to believe Vision

With all our might & strength tho we are fallen &  
lost

ADAM: Eve thou hast spoken truly. let us kneel before his feet.

*They Kneel before Jehovah.*

ABEL: Are these the Sacrifices of Eternity O Jehovah, a Broken Spirit

And a Contrite Heart. O I cannot Forgive\! the Accuser hath

Enterd into Me as into his House & I loathe thy Tabernacles

As thou hast said so is it come to pass: My desire is unto Cain

And He doth rule over Me: therefore My Soul in fumes of Blood

Cries for Vengeance: Sacrifice on Sacrifice Blood on Blood

10     JEHOVAH: Lo I have given you a Lamb for an Atonement instead

Of the Transgres\[s\]or, or no Flesh or Spirit could ever Live

ABEL: Compelled I cry O Earth cover not the Blood of Abel

*Abel sinks down into the Grave from which arises Satan*  
*Armed in glittering scales with a Crown & a Spear.*

SATAN: I will have Human Blood & not the blood of Bulls or Goats

And no Atonement O Jehovah the Elohim live on Sacrifice

Of Men: hence I am God of Men: Thou Human O Jehovah.

By the Rock & Oak of the Druid creeping Mistletoe & Thorn

Cains City built with Human Blood, not Blood of Bulls & Goats

Thou shalt Thyself be Sacrificed to Me thy God on Calvary

JEHOVAH:Such is My Will.                                            *Thunders.*

that Thou Thyself go to

Eternal Death

20         In Self Annihilation even till Satan Self-subdud Put off Satan

Into the Bottomless Abyss whose torment arises for ever & ever.

*On each side a Chrous of Angels entering Sing the following*:

The Elohim of the Heathen Swore Vengeance for Sin\! Then Thou stoodst

Forth O Elohim Jehovah\! in the midst of the darkness of the Oath\! All Clothed

In Thy Covenant of the Forgiveness of Sins: Death O Holy\! Is this Brotherhood

The Elohim saw their Oath Eternal Fire; they rolled apart trembling over The

Mercy Seat: each in his station fixt in the Firmament by Peace Brotherhood and Love.

*The Curtain falls.*

Terms printed in small capitals in the Notes are more fully defined in the Dictionary of Proper Names.

*Poetical Sketches*

A collection of Blake’s earliest known work, printed for him by his wealthier friends John Flaxman and the Rev. A. S. Mathew in 1783 but not publicly distributed. There are twenty-two known copies, some containing corrections in B.’s hand. The ‘Advertisement’ \(p. ii\) reads:

‘The following Sketches were the production of untutored youth, commenced in his twelfth, and occasionally resumed by the author till his twentieth year; since which time, his talents having been wholly directed to the attainment of excellence in his profession, he has been deprived of the leisure requisite to such a revisal of these sheets, as might have rendered them less unfit to meet the public eye.

‘Conscious of the irregularities and defects to be found in almost every page, his friends have still believed that they possessed a poetic originality, which merited some respite from oblivion. These their opinions remain, however, to be now reproved or confirmed by a less partial public.’

B.’ literary models include Elizabethan poetry, Shakespearean drama, Milton, Thomson’s *Seasons* \(1726–30\), Percy’s *Reliques of Ancient Poetry* \(1756\), Gray, Collins and the then popular archaic forgeries of ‘Ossian’ and Chatterton. His antipathy is the elegant Augustan couplet and its imitations.



### **MISCELLANEOUS POEMS**

TO SPRING

The metre of this and the following five lyrics is irregular blank verse.

13–16 *pour*… *modest tresses* The imagery recalls Collins’ ‘Ode to Evening’: ‘While Spring shall pour his showers, as oft he wont/And bathe thy breathing tresses, meekest Eve.’

15 *languish’d head* A phrase from Milton: *Comus* 744 and *Samson Agonistes* 119.

TO SUMMER

6 *thy ruddy limbs and flourishing hair* Reappears in the Notebook epigram ‘Abstinence sows sand all over/The ruddy limbs & flaming hair,’ p. 153 below.

TO AUTUMN

The close of this poem parallels that of Milton’s *Lycidas*: ‘Thus sang the uncouth swain…’

TO WINTER

11 *and his hand*\] Printed ‘and in his hand’, corrected by B. in some copies.

16 *mount Hecla* An Icelandic volcano mentioned in Thomson’s *Winter* 888.

TO MORNING

1 In Spenser’s *Epithalamion* 151, Phoebe rises at dawn ‘Clad all in white, that seems a virgin best’.

FAIR ELENOR

This poem and ‘Gwin’ \(p. 32 below\) are in the archaizing and sensational ‘Gothic’ style popular in the late eighteenth century. Both are ballads.

34–5 *the arrows that fly… destruction* Psalm 91:5–6: ‘the arrow that flieth… the destruction that wasteth’.

61 *behold*\] Printed ‘I am’, corrected by B. in some copies.

68 *to bereave my life* The usage occurs in Spenser, *Faerie Queene* 1.iii.36.2: ‘He to him leapt, in mind to reave his life’.

SONG: ‘HOW SWEET I ROAM’D…’

B. is supposed to have written this lyric before the age of fourteen \(Bentley, *Blake Records*, 428\). The ‘prince of love’ is Eros or Cupid, and the winged victim suggests Psyche \(Gr. ‘soul’\), who was depicted as a young woman with butterfly wings, or simply as a butterfly, in books B. might have seen during his apprenticeship.

SONG: ‘MY SILKS AND FINE ARRAY…’

This poem is a pastiche of Elizabethan imagery. For example, the clown’s song in *Twelfth Night*, 11.iv.52, ‘Come away, come away, death,’ has a dying lover, yew, and a true lover weeping over a tomb. The grave-digger in *Hamlet* \(v.i.94–5\) sings of ‘A pickax, and a spade, a spade,/For and a shrouding sheet’. The female lover, however, is not typically Elizabethan.

SONG: ‘LOVE AND HARMONY COMBINE…’

16 *his*\] Printed ‘her’, corrected by B. in one copy.

MAD SONG

Percy’s *Reliques* contained six ‘Mad Songs’ and a note that ‘madness’ seemed to be a peculiarly English theme.

2 *the night is a-cold* In *King Lear* III.iv.152, ‘Poor Tom’s a-cold.’

4 *infold*\] Printed ‘unfold’, altered by B. in one copy.

7 *birds*\] Printed ‘beds’, corrected by B. in some copies.

17 *Like a fiend in a cloud* This line reappears in ‘Infant Sorrow’, *SE*, p. 129 below, and the image of the ‘cloud’ as the fleshly body which hides and imprisons the essential spirit is also in ‘The Little Black Boy’, *SI*, p. 106 below.

SONG: ‘WHEN EARLY MORN…’

1 Resembles *Lycidas* 187, ‘While the still morn went out with Sandals gray.’

TO THE MUSES

Solicitations to the muses were an eighteenth-century commonplace, probably derived from the unsatisfied search in *Lycidas* 50–55, ‘Where were ye Nymphs… For neither were ye playing on the steep… Nor on the shaggy top of *Mona* high,/Nor yet where *Deva* spreads her wisard stream’.

GWIN, KING OF NORWAY

13 *Gordred the giant* Probably from Chatterton’s ‘Gordred Covan’ \(printed in 1778 in Chatterton’s *Miscellanies*, but in magazine form earlier\).

65 *like balances* The image of heavenly scales as a sign before a conflict is from *Paradise Lost* iv.1011–14.

75–88 Addison’s *The Campaign* 11–12 has ‘Rivers of blood… and hills of slain,/An Iliad rising out of one campaign’. ‘Hills of slain’ is a repeated phrase in Chatterton.

83 *Like blazing comets* In *I Henry IV* I.i.10–13, armies ‘like the meteors of a troubled heaven… Did lately meet in the intestine shock/And furious close of civil butchery’.

AN IMITATION OF SPEN\[S\]ER

An early attempt on B.’s part to define his poetic vocation. The title is printed ‘Spencer’, and is uncorrected. B. uses Spenserian archaisms and a nine-line stanza, but does not attempt to reproduce Spenser’s rhyme scheme.

10–15 *brutish Pan… Midas* Midas carelessly judged Pan superior to Apollo in a singing contest, and was rewarded with ass’s ears.

13 *leesing* B. takes Spenser’s ‘lesing’ or ‘leasing’ \(lie, falsehood\) as an adjectival form.

18 *tinkling rhimes, and elegances terse* Criticism of the ‘elegant’ eighteenth-century couplet.

19 *Mercurius* Mercury, messenger of the gods, and god of Eloquence.

33 B. idealistically attributes to Eloquence what Richard Glover in *London: or, the Progress of Commerce* \(1739\) attributed to Commerce: ‘Thou, gracious Commerce, from his cheerless caves/In horrid rocks and solitary woods/The helpless wand’rer, man, forlorn and wild/Did charm to sweet society.’

46 *Pallas, Minerva* Greek and Latin names for the goddess of Wisdom.

BLIND-MAN’S BUFF

Metre, tone and opening image are from the song in *Love’s Labour’s Lost* v.ii.922–3, ‘When icicles hang by the wall/And Dick the shepherd blows his nail’.

KING EDWARD THE THIRD

An unfinished dramatic fragment inspired by Shakespeare’s history plays, especially *Henry V.* The metre is blank verse, but extremely loose. The play combines an ironic treatment of military values urged in the name of high ideals, with an attempt at Shakespearean ‘sympathy’ even for villains and misled men, and an apparently genuine admiration for bravery. B. might have found both the historical details and his critical approach to Edward and his conquests in Thomas Cooke’s *Life of King Edward III of England* \(1734\), which saw Edward as a ‘gallant and illustrious Murderer’.

SCENE 1

9 *Liberty* The major ideal invoked by patriotic English poets throughout the eighteenth century. In the most famous example, Thomson’s poem *Liberty* \(1735\), ‘Cressy, Poitiers, Agincourt proclaim/What Kings supported by almighty love/And people fired with liberty can do’ \(Iv.865–7\).

19 *triple steel* The demons in *Paradise Lost* 11.569 are armed ‘with stubborn patience as with triple steel’.

SCENE 2

16 *first to commerce?* The virtues of Commerce were celebrated in a large body of eighteenth-century Whig poetry, including Young’s *The Merchant* \(1729\), dedicated to ‘His grace the Duke of Chandos’ \(Chandos is one of B.’s characters here\), Glover’s *Progress of Commerce* \(1739\) and Thomson’s *Liberty.*

36–7 The Druids of ancient England are supposed to have worshipped in oak groves. Hence the Bishop’s ‘wisdom’ is ironically more heathen than Christian.

52 *’tis with princes as* ’*tis with the sun* King Henry gives Prince Hal similar advice in *I Henry IV* III.ii.29–91.

SCENE 3

154ff. Dagworth’s conversations with the common soldiers parallel those of the young King in *Henry V* Iv.i.

272–4 *but the pure soul… heaven of glory* The headstrong Hotspur in *I Henry IV* I.iii.201–2 cries: ‘By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap/To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon’.

SCENE 4

Stage direction *William his Man* Presumably the mouthpiece of William Blake; hence the scene is ironic.

SCENE 6

1 *Trojan Brutus* The legendary Brutus who was supposed to have escaped the fallen Troy and founded the British nation.

51 *prevented* Prefigured and eclipsed.

DRAMATIC FRAGMENTS

PROLOGUE… KING EDWARD THE FOURTH

1 *O For a voice* Parallels the prologue to *Henry V.*

4 *Who can stand?* The ‘who shall stand’ formula is used in Nahum 1:6, Malachi 3:2, Revelation 6:17.

PROLOGUE TO KING JOHN

The form of the prose-poem was popular in B.’s day. B. wrote five other experimental pieces in the same style: ‘The Couch of Death’, ‘Contemplation’ and an unfinished ‘Samson’ \(not reprinted here\) which conclude *PS;* and the MS.fragments ‘Then She Bore Pale Desire’ and ‘Woe Cried the Muse’.

1 *Albion’s breast* Albion here is female: she is the soul of England which must be redeemed from Tyranny and War. In B.’s later work Albion is a male figure whose female counterpart is named ‘Jerusalem’.

A WAR SONG TO ENGLISHMEN

Possibly the second mistrel’s song promised to Dagworth in *King Edward the Third* sc. 4. If so, the promise of ‘glorious’ death should be taken ironically.

POEMS WRITTEN IN A COPY OF *POETICAL SKETCHES*

These three poems were written in a copy of *Poetical Sketches* inscribed ‘from Mrs Flaxman May 15, 1784’. ‘Song 2nd by a Young Shepherd’ is an early version of ‘Laughing Song’, *SI*, p. 109 below.

SONG BY AN OLD SHEPHERD

I Compare the opening of ‘Blind-man’s Buff’, *PS*, p. 37 and n.

*Songs from ‘An Island in the Moon*

Date of composition: *c.* 1784. ‘Island’ is an untitled and unfinished MS. burlesque on a lunar society which ‘seems to have some affinity to England’. The characters, parodies of Blake himself and his circle of friends, meet in a salon-type setting and occasionally break – sober or drunk – into song. The ‘three philosophers’ are Quid the Cynic \(William Blake\), Suction the Epicurean \(Robert Balke\) and Sipsop the Pythagorean \(probably the Platonist Thomas Taylor\). Steelyard the Lawgiver is B.’s friend John Flaxman. There is a full discussion of the work by M. W. England, ‘Apprenticeship at the Haymarket?’ in D. V. Erdman and J. E. Grant \(eds.\), *Blake’s Visionary Forms Dramatic*, Princeton University Press, 1970.

CHAP 3

12 *Honour & Genius* Parody of a song in James Harris’s *Daphnis and Amaryllis* \(1762\).

CHAP 6

13 *When old corruption* Suggested by John Gay’s ‘On Quadrille’ \(1727\), ‘When as Corruption hence did go/And left the nation free… Then Satan, thinking things went ill/Sent forth his spirit, call’d Quadrille.’ As a satire on the medical profession, this song may have been suggested by the play *The Devil Upon Two Sticks*, currently on stage. It also parodies the genealogy of Sin and Death in *Paradise Lost* 11.

CHAP 8

4 *John Taylor* Probably the dissenting minister \(1694–1761\), author of *The Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin*, 1740.

CHAP 9

3 *Lo the Bat* A combined parody of Pope’s ‘Lo, the poor Indian’ *\(Essay on Man* 1.99\) and Collins’s ‘Weak-eyed bat’ which ‘with short shrill shriek flits by on leathern wing’ \(‘To Evening’ 9–10\).

58 *This frog* From a popular nursery-rhyme.

116–17 *Doctor South/Or Sherlock* Dr Robert South \(1634–1716\) and Dr William Sherlock \(1641–1707\), author of *A Practical Discourse concerning Death* \(1689\), were writers of religious tracts. They are here contrasted with the philanthropist Thomas *sutton* \(1532–1611\). founder of Charterhouse, a charitable boys’ school and hospital for the aged.

147 *This city & this country* A parallel to the popular song ‘The Roast Beef of Old England’ from Fielding’s *Grub Street Opera.*

CHAP 11

1 *Upon a holy thursday* First version of ‘Holy Thursday’, *SI*, p. 111 below.

20 *When the tongues of children* First version of ‘Nurse’s Song’, *SI*, p. 114 below.

38 *O father* First version of ‘The Little Boy lost’, *SI*, p. 109 below.

103 *A crowned king* This song is unfinished; a leaf is missing from the MS.

*There is No Natural Religion \[a, b\] All Religions are One*

These three series of aphorisms, etched in 1788 on tiny copperplates, form B.’s earliest work in illuminated printing. They also constitute his first attack on deism, and his first apologia for the Poetic or Prophetic Character as the source of all religion and philosophy. The ideas, the mockery of rationalism and the insistence on Man’s potential infinitude are further developed in *MHH.*



### *******The Book of Thel***

Date: 1789 for most of the text, but Erdman and others agree that ‘Thel’s Motto’ and the conclusion \(Pl. 6\) are no earlier than 1791. Fifteen copies of this illuminated book are known.

Thel \(Gr. ‘wish’ or ‘will’\) may be understood equally as descending to earthly life, to death or to the state of Experience. Like the virgin-goddess Persephone, she undertakes a descent to the underworld; but she fears and rejects the impending transformation. The metre is iambic septenary, B.’s adaptation of ballad form into long lines.

THEL’s MOTTO

P1. i LI. 3–4 form a deleted line in *Tiriel*, and appear to allude to ‘Or ever the silver cord to be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken’, Ecclesiastes 12:6. But the silver rod and golden bowl here evidently stand for male and female sexual organs.

I

P1. I.I *Mne Seraphim* An obscure name, not used again. The term ‘Bne Seraphim’ \(‘Sons of the Seraphim’\) occurs in the *Occult Philosophy* of the alchemist philosopher Cornelius Agrippa \(1486–1535\), and is associated with concord, cure of melancholy and barrenness, and increase of fruitfulness in men and animals. Alteration to ‘Mne’ puns on ‘Mnetha’ \(see *Tiriel*\) to produce ironic associations. Thus Thel remains lonely and virginal, rejecting fruitfulness for herself.

4 *river of Adona* Probably from the river Adonis in *Paradise Lost* \[1.450–52, hence associated with rituals of fertility and of death and rebirth.

13–14 *the voice/Of him that walketh* ‘And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day,’ Genesis 3:8.

P1. 2.1 *the vales of Har* See *Tiriel* 2.4ff,. *The Song of Los* 4.5–16.

II

P1. 3.8 *Luvah* A sun-god of Love. This is the first mention of any of the FOUR ZOAS.

IV

P1. 6.1 In the cave of the Naiads *\(Odyssey*, XIII\) there are two gates, one towards the north, for men; one to the south, for gods. The neo-Platonists explained this passage allegorically as a descent of the soul to matter. In Spenser’s *Faerie Queene* 111.vi.31 the Garden of Adonis, in which all souls grow, also has ‘Double gates… th’one fair and fresh, the other old and dried,’ and a porter, ‘Old Genius, the which a double nature had’.

9 *her own grave plot* Her own body, or her own potential Experience. In neo-Platonic theory, what we call ‘life’ should be understood as death or imprisonment to the soul.

& *there she sat down* ‘By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion,’ Psalm 137:1.

19–20\] Lines deleted in two copies.

*Tiriel*

Date: *c.* 1789. An eight-page manuscript, never published, written in a fair hand except for the conclusion \(8.4ff.\), which is hastily written and may be some years later. Deletions of lines and passages occur throughout. The theme is Tyranny. The manner is Gothic. The metre is septenary.

1

1 *Aged Tiriel* The name is found in Agrippa’s *Occult Philosophy*, associated with the planet Mercury and the base elements sulphur and mercury. It also suggests ‘tyrant’, ‘ritual’ and the Prince of Tyre denounced by Ezekiel for assuming the role of God. Analogues to Tiriel’s obsessively tyrannical and blind personality include Oedipus, King Lear and possibly George III of England, some years later described by Shelley as ‘An old, mad, blind, despised and dying King’.

3 *Myratana… western plains* In the antiquarian Jacob Bryant’s *New System* \(1774–6\), *Myrina* is a queen of *Mauretania* \(West Africa\).

22 *Serpents not sons* ‘Tigers, not daughters,’ *King Lear* Iv.ii.40.

25 *Heuxos or Yuva* The source of these names is unknown.

35 *son of Zazel* Zazel, a rejected and enslaved brother of Tiriel \(section 7\). The name occurs in Agrippa’s *Occult Philosophy*, associated with discord and loss of honours \(Damon\), and in occult Hebraic-Christian tradition as an earth demon who presides over corpses \(Stevenson\). *Azazel* is Heb. ‘scapegoat’.

2

4 *vales of Har* Since *Har* is Heb. ‘mountain’, ‘vales of Har’ is ironic or pathetic.

5 *Har* & *Heva* Tiriel’s parents, a degenerated and senile Adam and Eve representing the failure of Natural Law.

6 *Mnetha* Compound of Athena \(Wisdom\) and Mnemosyne \(Memory, mother of the muses\), the nurse or foster-mother of Har and Heva.

3

14 *the cage of Har* This and ll. 22–3 are literary satire, with ‘great cage’ suggesting the heroic couplet and ‘our singing birds’ and ‘fleeces’ suggesting domesticated neo-classical lyric and pastoral.

4

3 *Ijim* In Isaiah 13:21, this is a collective term meaning ‘creatures of the wilderness’ or ‘satyrs’. The figure here represents savage superstition – an alternative to Tiriel’s civilization, but not an acceptable one. He may be a satire on Rousseau’s ‘noble savage’.

40 *bore him on his shoulders* Ironic inversion of Aeneas bearing his father Anchises on his shoulders *from* the burning Troy *\(Aeneid* 11.705–29\).

50–61 The transformations resemble those of Proteus in Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* VIII.734–8.

59 *toad… in my ears* Satan is found ‘Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve’ in *Paradise Lost* IV.800.

87 *Orcus* A Latin name for Hell.

5

18 *five daughters* Five senses.

24 *Hela* A Norse goddess of Hell in Gray’s ‘Descent of Odin’.

33 *Thirty… sons* Compare the degeneration of the thirty cities of Africa in *BU* IX, p. 257 below.

6

5 *This is the right & ready way* Possible ironic allusion to Milton’s *The Ready and Easy Way to Establish a Free Commonwealth* \(1660\), comparably written in desperation during a political collapse.

43 *Let snakes rise* Medusa was thus accursed by Athena.

8

10 *one law* ‘One Law for the Lion & Ox is Oppression’ \(conclusion of *MHH*\). See also *VDA* 4.22.

37–41 *Compelld to pray… my thirsty hissings* Tiriel’s story parallels that of Satan in *Paradise Lost.* Satan is compelled to worship, and rebels. He becomes a subtle serpent in Paradise. In *Pl* x.504–77 Satan and his followers are transformed unwillingly into serpents, and forced to chew a seeming fruit of knowledge which turns to ashes: ‘Thus were they plagued/And worn with famine long, and ceaseless hiss.’

*Songs of Innocence and of Experience*

*The Songs of Innocence* were composed *c.* 1784–90. Drafts of ‘Nurse’s Song’, ‘The Little Boy lost’ and ‘Holy Thursday’ appear in *An Island in the Moon.* The illuminated volume was first published alone \(1789\), later incorporated in the combined volume *Songs of Innocence and of Experience* \(1794\), but also sometimes issued separately thereafter.

The *Songs of Experience* were composed for the most part between 1790 and 1792 \(see Notebook drafts, pp. 134–61 below\). But ‘The Little Girl Lost’, ‘The Little Girl Found’, ‘The School Boy’ and ‘The Voice of the Ancient Bard’ first appeared in *Innocence* and were then transferred to *Experience.* ‘To Tirzah’ does not appear in five copies, and may be from 1805 or later \(Erdman\). There are twenty-one known copies of *SI* and twenty-seven of *SIE.* The order of the poems within each group varies, but eight copies follow the arrangement given here.

The form of these songs may suggest Tudor and Jacobean lyric, Wesleyan hymns, and nursery rhymes. In part, the form also derives from Isaac Watts \(1674–1748\), whose *Divine and Moral Songs in Easy Language* \(1715\), a chapbook of short poems intended for children, was still popular in B.’s day. Several of B.’s poems implicitly criticize Watts’s religion and morality.



### ****SONGS OF INNOCENCE

THE ECCHOING GREEN

Title A village common.

The scene, the day–night cycle and the images of animated nature corresponding with human activity all parallel Spenser’s *Epithalamion.*

THE LAMB

Title ‘The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, “Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world”’ \(John 1:29\). See also the conclusion of B.’s prose tract *There is No Natural Religion*: ‘Therefore God becomes as we are, that we may be as he is,’ p. 76 above.

THE LITTLE BLACK BOY

The Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade was formed in 1787, and many artists and writers were involved in this movement. B. too opposed slavery, but the plea of this poem is more fundamentally against doctrines of racial and religious superiority. Immediate targets may have been Watts’s lyrics ‘Praise for Birth and Education in a Christian Land’ and ‘Praise for the Gospel’, in both of which a little English boy thanks God for making him born a Christian, and pities the heathen.

14 *to bear the beams of love* cf. Watts’s ‘Grace Shining and Nature Fainting’ *\(Horae Lyricae*, 1709\): ‘Nor is my soul refined enough/To bear the beaming of his love,/And feel his warmer smiles./When shall I rest this drooping head?/I love, I love the sun, and yet I want the shade.’

16 *but a cloud* Dante’s *Purgatorio* XXVIII.90 compares the body to a cloud.

25 *Ill shade him* The two boys will be ‘free’ of their bodies – yet one is still darker, one whiter and needing assistance. Why? The paradox is adumbrated by Job 19:26: ‘though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God’.

THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER

This poem may be read in two contrary ways: 1. As an indictment of a society which enslaves children both physically and spiritually, promising heaven hereafter in exchange for obedient suffering here, its conclusion in favour of ‘duty’ is bitterly ironic \(see ‘An answer to the parson’, p. 155 below\). 2. As a celebration of the boys’ imagination, the conclusion is positive, the happiness and warmth are not delusive but real, and ‘duty’ means seeing and feeling the delightful reality of spiritual life. See B.’s letter to Hayley, Oct. 1803: ‘… now I have lamented over the dead horse let me laugh and be merry… for as Man liveth not by bread alone I shall live altho I should want bread – nothing is necessary to me but to do my Duty and to rejoice in the exceeding joy that is always poured on my Spirit’ *\(Letters*, ed. Keynes, 100–101\).

3 *weep weep* Ironically foreshortened pronunciation of the street-cry ‘Sweep\!’

THE LITTLE BOY LOST

A draft of this poem appears in *An Island in the Moon.*

8 *the vapour* A will-o’-the-wisp; the ‘wand’ ring light’ of the next poem. The design shows the boy pursuing a light, perhaps mistaking it for his father.

LAUGHING SONG

An earlier version of this poem is on p.61; the girls’ names are different.

A CRADLE SONG

In part a reaction to Watts’s metrically similar ‘Cradle Hymn’, where the mother congratulates her infant on being materially better off than thé infant Jesus: ‘How much better thou’rt attended/Than the Son of God could be… Here’s no ox anear thy bed,’ etc. B.’s mother sings of spiritual rather than material grace, and perceives the closeness of infant and Creator rather than the distinction.

THE DIVINE IMAGE

17 *all must love* Both an imperative, ‘all *should* love’, and a declarative, ‘all *do* \(logically, of necessity\) love’.

HOLY THURSDAY

Title Charity children were brought to annual services at St Paul’s on the first Thursday in May. A first draft of this poem appears in *An Island in the Moon*, where the children wear ‘grey’ instead of ‘red’.

9 *mighty wind* In Acts 2:1–4 the sound of a ‘rushing mighty wind’ comes from heaven, and the congregation, filled with the Holy Ghost, begins to speak in tongues.

NIGHT

31 *each mild spirit* The angels receive the spirits of predators as well as victims.

42 From the vision of the peaceable kingdom in Isaiah 11:6.

45 *lifes river* ‘And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,’ Revelation 22:1.

INFANT JOY

2–5 The repetition of ‘I am’ in connection with the query ‘What shall I call thee?’ suggests Moses’ first encounter with the God who identifies Himself as ‘I AM’. By implication the infant is divine and divinity is ‘joy’.

A DREAM

Watts’s song ‘The Ant, or Emmet’ is metrically similar.

1 *a shade* Shadow or protection.

ON ANOTHERS SORROW

22 *Wiping all our tears away* ‘and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes’, Revelation 7:17, 21:14.



### ****SONGS OF EXPERIENCE

INTRODUCTION

Interpretation of this poem depends upon whether the call of stanzas 2–4 is that of the Bard, or that of the Holy Word. It also depends upon whether the Holy Word and this call are to be conceived as generous and merciful or tyrannical and punitive. Unlike the tender God of *Innocence*, the God of *Experience* is the repressive father-figure of institutional religion.

4–7 Adam and Eve, having sinned, ‘heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and… hid themselves… amongst the trees of the garden,’ Genesis 3:8.

8 *That* may refer to ‘voice’, ‘Holy Word’ or ‘lapsed soul’.

8–9 *controll* Restrain, curb *\(OED* 4.b\).

*The starry pole* The north pole, or region of the pole star. In B. this image is associated with war and monarchy.

11 From Jeremiah 22:29: ‘O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord.’ Milton, in *The Ready and Easy Way to Establish a Free Commonwealth*, complaining that England was choosing ‘a Captain back for Egypt’, declares, ‘Thus much I should perhaps have said, though I were sure I should have spoken only to Trees and Stones; and had none to cry to, but with the Prophet, “O Earth, Earth, Earth\!” to tell the very Soil itself, what her perverse inhabitants are deaf to.’

18 *starry floor* An image of Reason. Stars in B. are associated with the rational God who created a Newtonian cosmos. As in ancient metaphysics, the stars are symbols or agents of Necessity, which rules the world of Nature.

19 *watry shore* An image of Materialism, elsewhere in B. called the dead ‘sea of Time and Space’.

EARTH’S ANSWER

The Notebook draft for this poem is on p. 142 below.

7 *Starry fealousy* The Jealous God, who created the stars in conformity with Reason and Law, demands obedience from the soul, and keeps Earth imprisoned. Elsewhere in Blake this God is called URIZEN.

13–15 Can a creative or procreative impulse fulfil itself when repressed?

21 *this heavy chain* Reason; repressive Moral Law; the flesh itself.

23 *vain* \(1\) Self-admiring; \(2\) futile.

HOLY THURSDAY

A ‘contrary’ poem to that of *Innocence.* The Notebook draft is on p. 155 below.

4 *usurous hand* \(1\) Economically, the supposed benefactors of the charity children are rich citizens of London; \(2\) spiritually, the citizens expect a return of gratitude on their investment of charity.

THE LITTLE GIRL LOST

In this and the following poem, Lyca \(like the heroine of *The Book of Thel*\) may be understood as the soul entering mortal life, or the Innocent entering Experience – specifically sexual experience. Though the new state seems a decline \(a sleep\), she does not fear it, and is protected. Details derive from neo-Platonic interpretations of the myth of Persephone, as well as the ‘Sleeping Beauty’ and ‘Snow White’ of fairy tales.

3–4 \(1\) Sleep is the ‘sentence’ passed on earth \(and all mankind\). It is both serious \(‘grave’\) and profound \(‘deep’\). \(2\) It is a sentence of death. \(3\) ‘Grave’ also means ‘engrave’.

7–8 *the desart*… *a garden* In Isaiah 35:1 ‘the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose’. In the myth of Persephone, the earth grows barren when the virgin-goddess is captured by the King of Hades, but resumes its fertility at her annual return each spring.

13 *Seven Summers old* The design, however, shows an adolescent maiden embracing a youth.

THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND

2 *Lyca’s parents* In the myth, the earth-goddess Ceres seeks her abducted daughter through the world, and finally bargains for her annual return. B., however, gives *two* parents and has them remain with the child.

36 According to some classical sources, Pluto \(god of the underworld\) and Zeus \(god of heaven\) are one. Here, ‘beast’ and ‘spirit’ are one.

THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER

The ‘contrary’ poem to that of *Innocence.* Notebook draft, p. 151.

NUKSES SONG

The ‘contrary’ poem to that of *Innocence.* Notebook draft, p. 144.

THE SICK ROSE

Notebook draft, p. 149.

THE FLY

Notebook draft, p. 156.

5–6 From Gray’s ‘Ode on the Spring’: ‘Poor moralist\! and what art thou? A solitary fly.’

THE ANGEL

Notebook draft, p. 155. An allegory on Chastity.

THE TYGER

See *MHH* 8.7, p. 184 below: ‘The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and the destructive sword. are portions of eternity too great for the eye of man.’ ‘Contrary’ poem to ‘The Lamb’, *Innocence.* Notebook draft, p. 145.

2 *forests of the night* The dark woods of Dante’s *Inferno* and Milton’s *Comus* represent Nature. Both contain beasts which symbolize the dangerous passions. B.’s tyger is \(1\) God’s wrath, as the Lamb is His Love; \(2\) a ruthless natural predator; \(3\) man’s own ‘burning’ passion shut in his natural body. The questioner – throughout the poem – cannot understand how such things come to be.

4 *frame* \(1\) Construct, fabricate; \(2\) place within a restrictive border.

6 *fire of thine eyes* \(1\) Fiery eyes; \(2\) fire itself, before it was seized and used for eyes.

17–18 *the stars… their spears… their tears* The fading of the first stars, falling of the first dew? In *FZ* v.64.26–8 the god of Reason, URIZEN, describes the Fall: ‘I called the stars around my feet in the night of councils dark/The stars threw down their spears & fled naked away/We fell.’ Here, too, the suggestion is that Reason, having created a ‘frame’ for primordial Energy, is still inadequate to deal with it.

MY PRETTY ROSE TREE

Notebook draft, p. 134.

AH\! SUN–FLOWER

In Ovid’s *Metamorphoses* the nymph Clytie pines away for love of the scornful sun-god Hyperion, and is transformed to a flower whose face follows the path of the sun all day.

THE LILLY

THE GARDEN OF LOVE

Notebook draft, p. 135.

THE LITTLE VAGABOND

Notebook draft, p. 153.

LONDON

Watts’s ‘Praise for Mercies’ begins, ‘Whene’er I take my walks abroad,/How many poor I see.’ Watts’s comfortable child–speaker, noting the starvation, ragged clothing, ill-housing and criminal tendencies of others, promises to love the God who has created these pleasant inequities.

1 *charter’d* The charters of London were ancient guarantees of the city’s liberties. B.’s use is ironic.

10 *appalls* \(1\) Horrifies, frightens; \(2\) casts a pall over.

15–16 The harlot to whom a young man resorts may infect both him and his family. But all are victimized by the deadening institution of the ‘Marriage hearse’, which prohibits free love.

THE HUMAN ABSTRACT

‘Contrary’ poem to ‘The Divine Image’, *Innocence.* Notebook draft, p. 147.

5 *mutual fear brings peace* A summary description of the Social Contract.

14 *Mystery* B.’s first mention of the TREE OF MYSTERY.

INFANT SORROW

‘Contrary’ poem to ‘Infant Joy’, *Innocence.* Notebook draft, p. 139.

A POISON TREE

Notebook draft, p. 138.

A LITTLE BOY LOST

‘Contrary’ poem to ‘The Little Boy lost’ and ‘Found’, *Innocence.* Notebook draft, p. 150. Watts’s ‘Obedience to Parents’ reads: ‘Have ye not heard what dreadful plagues/Are threatened by the Lord,/To him that breaks his father’s law/Or mocks his mother’s word?… The ravens shall pick out his eyes,/And eagles eat the same.’

A LITTLE GIRL LOST

‘Contrary’ poem to ‘The Little Girl Lost’, originally in *Innocence.*

TO TIRZAH

This poem is only in later copies of *SIE* and cannot be earlier than mid-1803 in its style of lettering. Tirzah, an important figure in *Milton* and *Jerusalem*, is the individual’s mortal mother, or Mother Nature herself. The design shows a dead body being anointed by an old man, on whose robes appear the words, ‘It is raised a spiritual body’, from Paul’s discussion of the resurrection of the body \(I Corinthians 15:44\).

16 *what have I to do with thee?* Jesus says to Mary \(John 2:4\) ‘Woman, what have I to do with thee?’



### *******Notebook Poems and Fragments, c. 1789–93***

B.’s much-used Notebook \(also known as the Rossetti MS., since it was owned for a time by D. G. Rossetti\) was apparently inherited from his brother Robert, who died in 1787. From *c.* 1789 until as late as 1818, he made this notebook a major repository for drawings and sketches, drafts and fair copies of poems, miscellaneous squibs, and prose writings.

The group of poems here consists of drafts for most of the lyrics in *Songs of Experience*, plus other lyrics written at the same period and on similar themes; two political pieces datable to 1792–3 \(all this work is clustered at the back of the Notebook, which was reversed to make a new beginning\); and an epigram on marriage inscribed near the front of the volume, but not dated.

An attempted ‘contrary’ to ‘A Cradle Song’, *SI*, p. 110, but not finally used in *SE.*

CHRISTIAN FORBEARANCE

Becomes ‘A Poison Tree’, *SE*, p. 129.

INFANT SORROW

B. kept only the first two stanzas for the poem of this name in *SE*, p. 129. It is a ‘contrary’ to ‘Infant Joy’, *SI*, p. 115.

36–7 This couplet also concludes ‘In a mirtle shade’ \(Notebook, p. 142\) and ‘The Angel’ \(Notebook, p. 155; *SE*, p. 124\).

‘SILENT SILENT NIGHT’

Possibly intended as a ‘contrary’ to ‘Night’, *SI*, p. 112.

‘O LAPWING…’

The lapwing is a kind of plover, noted for a slow, irregular flapping flight and a shrill wailing cry. Probably a sexual *double entendre;* see ‘Thou hast a lap full of seed’.

‘THOU HAST A LAP FULL OF SEED…’

The term is used bawdily in *Hamlet* 111.ii.121: ‘Shall I lie in your lap? – No, my lord. – I mean, my head upon your lap?’

EARTHS ANSWER

Used, with the deleted stanza at the centre retained, in *SE*, p. 118.

IN A MIRTLE SHADE

Keys in after stanza 6 of ‘Infant Sorrow’, p. 140.

THE TYGER

First version: stanza 5 \(‘When the stars threw down their spears’\) was written later than the rest, and added on the following page of the Notebook.

Second version: this is a fair draft, written on the later page, of stanzas 1, 3, 5, 6, with stanza 2 then added to the left. But stanza 4 was now missing, and B. was apparently dissatisfied with this version. It was crossed out with several heavy strokes, and the previous rough draft was used as the basis for the final text in *SE*, p. 125.

THE HUMAN IMAGE

With the last six lines omitted, this becomes ‘The Human Abstract’, *SE*, p. 128.

THE SICK ROSE

Used, almost unchanged, in *SE*, p. 123.

‘NAUGHT LOVES ANOTHER…’

Becomes ‘A Little Boy Lost’, *SE*, p. 130.

THE CHIMNEY SWEEPER

Used unchanged in *SE*, p. 123.

MERLINS PROPHECY

In Geoffrey of Monmouth’s *History of the Kings of Britain*, ‘Merlin’s Prophecy’ is a series of gnomic verses which move from historic matters to apocalyptic imaginings. In *King Lear* the Fool concludes his set of satiric tetrameter couplets with a laconic ‘This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time’ \(III.ii.95\).

‘ABSTINENCE SOWS SAND…’

2 *The ruddy limbs & flaming hair* Adapted from the ‘ruddy limbs and flourishing hair’ of ‘To Summer’, *PS*, p. 21.

‘LITTLE FLY…’

Becomes ‘The Fly’, *SE, p.* 124.

9–10 *The cut worm Forgives the plough* Deleted here, this becomes a Proverb of Hell in *MHH*, p. 183.

AN ANCIENT PROVERB

1–2 *blackning church… marriage hearse* Phrases from ‘London’, p. 128.

‘LET THE BROTHELS OF PARIS BE OPENED…’

This and the following poem are both in very rough draft form, and were presumably written between October 1792 \(the fall of La Fayette\) and January 1793 \(the execution of Louis XVI\).

9 *Nobodaddy* ‘God the Father’; see ‘To Nobodaddy’, note, p. 891.

20 An ironic rejoinder to Edmund Burke’s famous paean on Marie Antoinette in *Reflections on the Revolution in France* \(1790\): ‘Surely never lighted on this orb, which she scarcely seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move in… little did I dream that I should have lived to see such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men… but the age of chivalry is gone.’

26 *a great many suckers* Shoots growing at a plant’s foot, parasites.

‘FAYETTE BESIDE KING LEWIS STOOD…’

At the outset of the French Revolution, the Marquis de La Fayette \(1757–1834\) was a ‘hero of the people’ for his past defence of liberty in the American war, and for his gallant soldiery and statesmanship. As commander of the national guard, La Fayette became the King’s *de facto* warder when the royal family was brought from Versailles to Paris by the army in October 1789. He consistently attempted to defend limited monarchy, and by 1792 was attacked by royalists as a revolutionary and by radicals \(including Blake\) as not revolutionary enough. After the Paris rising of August 1792 he was relieved of his command, abandoned by his army and proscribed by the Assembly. He fled France, and was arrested and imprisoned by the Austrians \(1793–7\). The poem is a response to his imprisonment.



### ***The French Revolution***

This poem exists as a set of page proofs, dated 1791, probably written 1790, commissioned by the radical publisher and bookseller Joseph Johnson. It was never published, and probably never continued beyond Book the First, despite the Advertisement.

The poem is a quasi-mythological treatment of events surrounding the fall of the Bastille \(14 July 1789\). On 17 June 1789, the Third Estate of France constituted itself a National Assembly. On 20 June it issued the ‘tennis-court oath’ defying the Monarchy. The King met in council on 19 and 21 June, and had several confrontations with the Assembly and Estates General in the following weeks. The much-resented troops which had been brought to Paris were ordered to withdraw on 15 July, the day after the Bastille fell.

B. condenses events of several weeks into one day, and invents some others. After a portentous opening and evocation of the Bastille as a symbol of tyranny, the royal council deliberates. ‘Burgundy’ and ‘Archbishop’ give anti-revolutionary militaristic speeches. ‘Orleans’ and ‘Sieyes’ give revolutionary and generous visionary addresses. The King \(spoken for by ‘Burgundy’\) refuses to remove the troops. But the Assembly successfully orders their withdrawal, leaving the King and peers helpless.

The metre is a loose anapestic septenary, which B. did not attempt elsewhere.

2 *the Prince* Louis XVI of France.

7 *Necker* Jacques Necker \(1732–1804\), the popular French-Swiss minister of finance under Louis. An anti-aristocratic economic reformer, he was dismissed 11 July 1789, recalled after the storming of the Bastille, and finally resigned 1790.

8 *five thousand years* B. uses a tradition that the world was created in 4004 BC, and that 6,000 years – now nearly concluded – would bring the Millennium \(see 1. 90\). Five thousand years is the period of Monarchy.

13 *Forty men* \(B.’s invention\) the Royal Council.

16 *the Commons* B.’s term for the Third Estate, which met in May and June 1789 at Versailles. B. intends this session to be understood as simultaneous with the Royal Council meeting.

18 *the Bastile* The fortress and State prison in the centre of Paris, soon to be stormed by the populace. The thousand troops and seven towers are B.’s invention, though the fortress did hold seven prisoners when seized. Damon \(314\) interprets the prisoners as: \(1\) the poet; \(2\) imprisoned royalty \(from the seventeenth-century story of the Man in the Iron Mask\); \(3\) the schismatic, representing religious liberty; \(4\) true religion, denying the power of the State; \(5\) the upholder of free speech; \(6\) the good man turned court parasite; \(7\) the patriot driven to madness by hopes of liberty.

59 *heavy brow’d jealousies* A thundercloud figure opposed to ‘light’ \(1.53\) and ‘spirits of fire’ \(1.54\): Aristocracy opposes the Third Estate. The Royal Council, however, met at Versailles, not in the Louvre.

62 *The voice ceas’d* i.e., ‘the loud voice of France’, 1. 15.

68ff. The following council scene is B.’s invention.

74–8 *Hide from the living… in the dust* In Revelation 6:15–16, kings, great men, rich men and captains ‘hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains, And said to the mountains…, Fall on us, and hide us… from the wrath of the Lamb.’

83 *Burgundy* B.’s invention. The last Duke of Burgundy died in 1714. B. uses the name \(1\) for association with vineyards and the winepress of War \(Isaiah 63, Revelation 14:19\); \(2\) for a pun on Edmund Burke, whose conservative ideas in *Reflections on the Revolution in France* \(1790\) are reflected in Burgundy’s speech.

89–90 *mowers… starry harvest* Imagery of stars swept to earth is found in Revelation 16:13 and 12:3–4. A last harvest of the earth is prophesied in Rev. 14:15–16.

*Atlantic mountains*: see Dictionary of Proper Names. Burgundy’s question means: shall revolutionaries subdue the armies which defend our traditions?

99 *To enrich the lean earth* Refers to a tradition that earth soaked in blood from battles would be fruitful.

100 *starry hosts* Armies.

104 *Till Fayette point his finger* Burgundy expects Fayette to attack the Assembly \(La Fayette was not in fact put in charge of the National Guard until 15 July\).

109 *Necker rise, leave the kingdom* Louis dismissed the liberals from his cabinet, and exiled Necker, on 11 July 1789.

116–20\] These lines follow 1. 104 in the original text. W. F. Halloran argues convincingly for the present reading.

126–7 *the Archbishop… sulphurous smoke* The Archbishop, representing clerical privilege, has Satanic attributes. His vision \(11. 130–50\) resembles the dream of Eliphaz in Job 4:13–21, in which a voice asks, ‘Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his maker?’ The Archbishop fears popular godlessness as portending the overthrow of royal and clerical privilege.

159 *Aumont* The Duke of Aumont refused to accept command of the newly formed National Guard on the eve of 14 July.

163 *The Abbe de Sieyes* A liberal leader who sat as representative of Paris in the Third Estate, rather than as ecclesiastic in the First Estate. He represents the liberal element in the clergy, and is ‘the voice of the people’ \(1.204\).

165 *King Henry the Fourth* The great popular monarch of the sixteenth century appears to accompany Sieyes in spirit.

168–9 *Bourbon… Bretagne… Borgogne* Invented personalities.

175 *Orleans* The Duke of Orleans \(1747–93\) made himself popular in Paris by large gifts to the poor in time of famine, and by airing democratic views. His bust, with Necker’s, was carried through the streets before the storming of the Bastille.

177 *instead of words harsh hissings* Taken from the humiliation of Satan in *Paradise Lost* x.517–19.

187–8 *Fayette… Mirabeau*… *Target*… *Bailly… Clermont* All revolutionary figures active in the National Assembly.

200 *Great Henry’s soul* Henry IV \(1. 165\).

211–14 *When the heavens*… *inslav’d* A condensed account of the material creation as identical with the decline of Man. This doctrine becomes central in B.’s major prophecies.

216ff. A prophecy of Man’s resurrection and redemption.

240 Mirabeau \(not Sieyes\) demanded the removal of the royal troops on 8 July 1789.

246 *blood ran down* The same image is in ‘London’, *SE*, p. 128.

251 *black southern prison* Probably L’Abbaye, in St Germain des Prés, which a mob attacked on 29 June, releasing eleven imprisoned soldiers \(Stevenson\).

261 *the General of the Nation* La Fayette. The following episode \(withdrawal of troops under Fayette on the Assembly’s command\) is B.’s invention.

204ff. An allegorical rendition of Louis’s failure to maintain military control over Paris. Creatures of the slime are released, and the bottoms of the world opened, as repressed elements begin to emerge.

306 *morning’s beam* A sunny peaceful morning, in contrast to the clouded morning which opens the poem.

*The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*

Date: *c.* 1790 \(‘A Song of Liberty’, 1792–3\). An illuminated book. Nine complete copies are known.

In part, *MHH* records B.’s reaction to Emanuel Swedenborg, a Swedish engineer-turned-visionary, whose many works were being translated into English in the 1780s. B. met John Flaxman, a fervent Swedenborgian, in about 1780, and attended the first General Conference of London Swedenborgians in 1789. There was much to attract him. Swedenborg was an enthusiast, believed in ‘Divine Humanity’, in the Bible as God’s dictation to inspired men, in minute and total correspondences between the natural world and the world of the spirit, and in the possibility of ordinary people attaining spiritual revelation. Swedenborg also exalted sexuality and formulated the image of a ‘Grand Man’ whose bodily form was the form of Heaven. Blake’s marginal comments on Swedenborg’s *Wisdom of Angels’ Concerning Divine Love* \(pub. 1789\) are sympathetic and include the remark, ‘Heaven and Hell are born together.’ But further reading persuaded B. that Swedenborg’s theology and morality were conventional at heart, and his imagination limited. On *Divine Providence* he annotates ‘Cursed Folly\!’ and calls S. a ‘Spiritual Predestinarian’. *MHH* attacks S. as inflated and pompous; B.’s ‘Memorable Fancies’ parody S.’s ‘memorable relations’ of spiritual experiences.

Aside from its attack on Swedenborg, *MHH* constitutes B.’s first full-scale foray on religious, political, social and literary orthodoxy, and a self-confidently exuberant announcement of his own principles.

P1. 2 *The Argument* The first piece of free verse in English. It is a condensed history of the birth and growth of Orthodoxy in this world, and a promise of impending upheaval.

1 *Rintrah* A figure vaguely suggesting Wrath; but see the Dictionary of Proper Names.

2 *swag* Sag, sway pendulously.

4–5 *The just man… death* In *Pilgrim’s Progress* Christian treads a perilously thin path through the Valley of the Shadow of Death.

10–13 *And a river… Red clay* Examples of miracles: God makes springs flow in the desert \(Exodus 17:1–7\) and clothes dry bones with flesh \(Ezekiel 37\). ‘Adam’ is Heb. for ‘red clay’. These miracles then attract the ‘villain’ of false orthodoxy which drives out justice.

19–20 *the just man… lions roam* The angry Elijah, Isaiah, Ezekiel or B. himself are all suggested as outcast voices of truth crying in the wilderness.

Pl. 3.1–2 *a new heaven… advent* A private joke. Swedenborg had announced that a ‘last Judgment was commenced in… 1757’, which happened to be the year of B.’s birth. B. in 1790 was now thirty-three –Christ’s age at His death and resurrection.

3–4 *Swedenborg is the Angel… linen clothes folded up* The angel and grave-clothes left neatly behind at the resurrection of Christ.

4–5 *dominion of Edom* Edom was the land of the despised children of Esau, a ‘just man’ who lost his birthright to his trickster-brother Jacob. In Genesis 27:40 the patriarch Isaac promises Esau an eventual ‘dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck’.

5–6 *Isaiah* XXXIV prophesies a ‘day of the Lord’s vengeance’ on ‘all nations’.

*Isaiah* XXXV prophesies the return of ‘the ransomed of the Lord’, when ‘The desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose.’

11 *Good & Evil* A succinct summary of the principles of morality here follows. B. makes the following associations:


*Good*  
Passive  
Reason  
Angels  
Heaven  
Soul


*Evil*  
Active  
   Energy  
   Devils  
   Hell  
   Body

He proceeds to advocate \(and illustrate, in his style of writing\) the latter set.

Pl. 5.4–5 *And being restraind… desire* The modern version of this idea is Freud’s theory of psychic repression in which super-ego \(‘good’ reason\) subdues id \(‘evil’ energy\).

7 *the Governor or Reason is call’d Messiah* In Milton’s *Paradise Lost* the son of God defeats Satan and his hosts and casts them out of Heaven. He is also the judge of Adam and Eve’s guilt.

10 *Sin & Death* From *Paradise Lost* 11.648ff.

11 *in the Book*… *Satan* Milton’s ‘Son’ is an accuser and punisher. So is the ‘Satan’ of the Book of Job.

Pl. 6.3–4 *he prays… comforter* Jesus in John 14:16–17, 26, promises a comforter who is ‘the spirit of truth’ and the ‘Holy Ghost’ to inspire and sustain the disciples. But the identification of the Comforter with Desire is B.’s own.

6 *he, who dwells*\] Mended in the copper from ‘The Devil who Dwells’.

10–11 *Milton wrote in letters… and at liberty* Wrote badly and wrote well. Critics have agreed that the ‘heavenly’ passages of *Paradise Lost* are duller than those dealing with Satan. B. accounts for this by the assumption that Poetic Genius is always more allied to Lawless Desire, represented by Satan, than to Law and Reason, represented by God and angels.

Pl. 7.1 *corroding fires MHH*, like B.’s other illuminated books, was etched, a process whereby corrosive acids are used to produce a design.

5 *Proverbs of Hell* The biblical Book of Proverbs endorses conventional prudence, wisdom and morality. B.’s Proverbs of Hell are Anti-Proverbs. The form also imitates Lavater’s *Aphorisms on Man* \(1788\), which B. read and annotated with sympathy.

11 Used in a deleted stanza of ‘Little fly…’, Notebook, p. 156.

Pl. 9.14 *The soul of sweet delight* Repeated in *VDA* 1.9, *America* 8.14.

Pl. 12.1 *The Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel* Swedenborg’s *Relations* were commonly encounters with heavenly spirits; but B. mocks S.’s solemnity.

14 *this firm perswasion removed mountains* In Matthew 17:19–20, the disciples fail to exorcise the devil from a child, and Jesus succeeds. The disciples ask, ‘Why could not we cast him out?’ The reply is, ‘Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove.’

Pl. 13.3 *our great poet King David* The supposed author of the Psalms.

17–18 *naked and barefoot three years* An episode in Isaiah 20.

19 *Diogenes* Greek cynic philosopher, *c.* 412–323 BC, who elected a life of virtuous poverty and lived in a tub. When Alexander asked what he might do for him, Diogenes replied, ‘Step out of my light.’

20–21 *eat dung… left side* An episode in Ezekiel 4 connected with the captivity prophesied for Israel. Eating bread baked over dung signified defilement.

Pl. 14.1 *The ancient tradition* A tradition, pre-dating Christianity but accepted by many Christians, that the world was limited to 6,000 years. B. also accepts the tradition established by Archbishop James Ussher \(1581–1656\) of dating the Creation at 4004 BC.

4 *the cherub with his flaming sword* ‘Cherubim, and a flaming sword’ \(Genesis 3:24\) are set by God to prevent Adam’s return to Eden.

12 *the infernal method. by corrosives* B.’s method of etching designs by acid. This is also a metaphor for the literary form of satire.

15 *the doors of perception* The five senses \(see ‘inlets of Soul’, 4.9\).

17–18 *For man has closed*… *cavern* Plato’s allegory of the cave *\(Republic* VII\) is the major source of this image in western literature and philosophy. In B. the cave or cavern of ignorance is often literally man’s skull. Cf. also Boehme’s *Aurora* x.96 \(quoted by Damon, 324\): ‘But if God did once put away that Duskiness, which moves about the Light, and that thy Eyes were opened, then in that very place where thou standest, sittest, or liest, thou shoudst see the glorious Countenance or Face of God and the whole Heavenly Gate.’

P1. 16.1–2 *The Giants… in chains* Man’s Energies, subdued by Reason, are like the Titans overthrown by the Olympians, or Prometheus chained to a mountain by Zeus for giving fire to mankind.

P1. 17.4–6 *Jesus Christ*… *Sword* See Matthew 25:32–3 and 10:34.

9 *An Angel* Angels represent conventional ‘good’ theology and morality. This one shows B. ‘Hell’ from his own point of view. B. reciprocates by showing him theology from a Blakean point of view.

16–19 *stable… church… vault… mill*… *cave… void* A logical descent from the place of Jesus’ birth progressively downwards, to institutional Religion, Dogma, analytical Reason, the imprisoned Mind, and the blankness which fills it \(in Locke’s theory of the *tabula rasa\).* An Inferno vision follows but is interrupted.

P1. 19.3–4 *My friend the Angel… mill* A retreat to the safer regions of philosophy and argument. ‘Mills’ in B. always symbolize a mechanical use of Reason.

23 *between saturn & the fixed stars* In pre-Copernican astronomy, Saturn was the outermost planetary sphere.

27 *a deep pit* For the theologian and scholar, the Bible is not a source of inspiration but a dark mystery requiring analysis. The seven houses are the schools of established religion, each with its own theologians and philosophers, which to B. are monkeys.

P1. 20.18 *Opposition is true Friendship*\] Deleted by pigment in six copies.

P1. 22.14 *Paracelsus* Swiss physician and alchemist, 1493–1541, author of numerous medical and occult works.

15 *Behmen* Jakob Boehme \(1575–1624\), German shoemaker, religious mystic and visionary. Both men influenced B. Boehme in particular believed in a God who, in Himself, contains all antithetical principles.

P1. 23.10 *bray a fool in a morter* Quotes Proverbs 27:22.

14–15 *did he not mock at the sabbath* The Devil cites scriptural evidence that Jesus scorned the Commandments. Passages referred to are Mark 2:27, John 8:2–11, Matthew 27:13–14. This view of a rebellious Jesus is further developed in *The Everlasting Gospel, c.* 1818, p. 848.

23 *Jesus was all virtue* From Lat. ‘vir’, man. ‘Superiority or excellence, unusual ability, merit, distinction; physical strength or energy; manliness’ *\(OED\).*

A SONG OF LIBERTY

As a topical piece, the ‘Song’ refers to the advent of the French Revolution in the fall of the Bastille \(1789\), and the hostility of the other European powers, culminating in an attempted invasion of France which was repulsed in September 1792. Most likely, the ‘Song’ was completed before England declared war on France in February 1793.

The allegory is as follows: In a Europe burdened by oppression, Nature gives birth to Revolution. Tyranny casts out the newborn child, but his fall rouses mankind and Tyranny collapses temporarily. In the ensuing confrontation between ‘gloomy king’ and ‘son of fire’, the former lacks morale and the latter anticipates an apocalyptic liberation.

P1. 25.1 *The Eternal Female groand\!* Nature is about to give birth. This figure is developed in B.’s later work.

7 *thy dungeon* The Bastille, sacked in 1789.

9 *thy keys* Traditional emblems of Papal authority.

11 *And weep* Line shortened from ‘And weep and bow thy reverend locks,’ to echo the shortest verse in the Bible, ‘Jesus wept’ \(John 11:35\) from the story of Lazarus. The old Europe, like Lazarus, is dying.

12–15 *the new born terror… the new born fire* This is the first appearance in Blake of ORC, spirit of Revolution, represented as a flaming youth. The ‘terrible babe’ figure also occurs in ‘The Mental Traveller’, Pickering MS., p. 499.

14–15 *mountains… atlantic sea* Atlantis, legendary utopian island, overcome by flood, also figures in *America.*

16 *starry king* Elsewhere developed as URIZEN, B.’s archetypal tyrant. Stars in B. are associated with rationalism and a fixed Newtonian universe.

P1. 26.10 *the hoary element* The sea.

17 *Urthona’s dens* The earth; see URTHONA. ORC, URIZEN and URTHONA are among the FOUR ZOAS who later become major figures in B.’s mythology.

P1. 27.7 *the stony law* The Ten Commandments, inscribed on tablets of stone.

15 *For every thing that lives is Holy* Repeated in *VDA* 8.10, *America* 8.13.

*Visions of the Daughters of Albion*

Date of publication: 1793. An illuminated book in iambic septenary metre. Seventeen complete copies are known.

    The story is simple: OOTHOON loves and offers herself to THEOTORMON, but is raped and held captive by BROMION. Maintaining her spiritual purity and liberty, she continues to offer her love to Theotormon, but he does not respond.

    As a tract on Free Love, the poem is a ‘contrary’ response to Milton’s *Comus*, which idealizes Chastity. But other issues are also central to this poem: the slave trade with its sexual abuse of female slaves, the exploitation of child labour, political and religious tyranny, and the rationalism which justifies such evils. For B., all these issues are one – Slavery *versus* Liberty – and all are dramatized by the opposition between closed human possessiveness and will to power, as against open human generosity and will to love. For full discussion of the political allegory see Erdman, 226–42.

Pl. 1.1–2 Oppressed British women may look to America longingly as a symbol of political and social liberty, but also pityingly as a symbol of the slave trade.

11 *Oothoon pluck’d* The plucking of a flower traditionally symbolizes sexual initiation.

16 *Bromion rent her* Bromion rapes the newly aroused Oothoon, who hereafter is both captive woman and captive slave.

21 *Stampt with my signet* Slaves were commonly branded by their owners.

P1. 2.3 *storms rent Theotormons limbs* Theotormon is emotionally devastated by the rape of Oothoon, but remains passive.

5 Bromion and Oothoon are ‘bound’ together, for the master is not truly free but dependent upon his victim.

8–10 Slaves and exploited children are kept subdued by cold religion while their masters exercise ‘volcanic’ lust for both sex and power.

13 *Theotormons Eagles* In Greek myth, Prometheus the fire-bringer was preyed on by the eagles of Zeus as punishment.

30–34 Body, mind and emotions, which should all be free, are rigidly limited. This destroys the individual’s true life.

35–6 *Instead of morn… an eye/… instead of night a… charnel house* Morn should bring fresh life and energy, but now the sun is only a judging eye. Night should bring rest and renewal, but now is deadly.

P1. 4.12–24 Bromion is troubled by a bad conscience and dim stirrings of awareness that Oothoon’s vision is correct. But he quickly returns to his original position of rigid materialism and moralism.

22 *one law for both the lion and the ox*? ‘One Law for the Lion & Ox is Oppression’ \(conclusion of *MHH*, p. 194\).

P1. 5.1ff. *her lamentation renewd* The remainder of the poem is Oothoon’s rhapsody on Liberty. Its argument is as follows: \(1\) The god of Reason \(URIZEN, 1. 3\) is wrong, for all individuals are unique and have their own forms, visions, joys. These are truly holy. The false holiness of State and Church wastes and exploits human energy. It also enforces loathsome marriages which in turn produce monstrous children. \(2\) Childhood should begin in erotic \(pleasure-loving\) infancy and move freely towards a mature sexuality which would bring vigour and bliss. The teachings of modesty distort this process and produce hypocrisy, self-righteousness and shame. Oothoon, having escaped these distortions, is perpetually virginal. Conventional virginity, however, is only repressed desire which must lead to auto-eroticism, a fruitless perversion. \(3\) True love is free. Possessiveness is not love. To prove her conviction, Oothoon offers complete liberty to Theotormon. She concludes with images of life-denying selfishness contrasted to the bliss of accepting all life as holy.

10 *contemns poverty* Disdains, despises the poor.

14–15 *the fat fed hireling… wastes* The gamekeeper who serves the rich at the expense of the poor; or the recruiting sergeant who lures young men away from the land.

17 *the parson* The collector of tithes, a mandatory church-tax.

P1. 5.41-Pl. 6.3 \(1\) Mortality for Man means life for worms; \(2\) the fact of mortality reminds Man to ‘seize the day’.

P1. 7.1 *In happy copulation* Copulation between the eye and its object. Oothoon declares that even visual perception is an erotic act.

12 *Father of Jealousy* URIZEN, the god of Reason, is also the traditional ‘Jealous God’ of the Old Testament.

*America*

Date of publication: 1793. Fifteen copies of this illuminated book are known. Proofs of three cancelled plates also exist: \[a\] is almost identical with Pl. 3, \[b\] was replaced by Pl. 4, \[c\] fits between Pls. 8 and 9. A fourth fragment \[d\] was apparently rejected from this poem. The metre is iambic septenary.

     Like *The French Revolution, America* treats history mythologically. But now B. concentrates less on day-to-day events, and more on the spiritual significance of the American revolt. The plot is as follows: Washington and his friends complain of oppression and are confronted by a wrathful Albion’s angel \(spirit of Repression\). At this moment ORC \(revolution\) explodes from the mid-Atlantic, defies England and promises human liberation. The angel sounds to war, but the thirteen colonies refuse to obey and the thirteen governors are helpless. The angel sends spiritual troops armed with plagues, but the plagues recoil upon England, URIZEN the tyrant-god intervenes and freezes the action for twelve years, but it is promised that the light of revolt will reach France and set Europe aflame.

PRELUDIUM

Title added \(by a small extra plate\) in all but two copies.

P1. 1.1 *The shadowy daughter… Urthona… red Orc* See Dictionary of Proper Names for these. Nature sustains Rebellious Energy until he is ready to seize her in a ‘fierce embrace’ \(1.10\) which will bring liberty. The story is retold in greater detail and less optimistically in *FZ* 7 \[a\] 85.12–22 and 7 \[b\] 91.1–93.31.

2 *fourteen suns* Fourteen years.

13–15 *eagle, lion, whale, serpent* Emblems of Liberty in North and South America. In Nature, they represent powers of air, earth, water, fire.

P1. 2.18–21 *The stern Bard… lamentings*\] These lines were omitted from almost all copies of *America.*

A PROPHECY

P1. 3.1 *The Guardian Prince of Albion* Also called ‘Albion’s Angel’, Pl. 5ff.

4 *Washington, Franklin, Paine & Warren, Gates, Hancock & Green* The first three were leaders of the American Revolution in military, political and ideological spheres respectively. The latter four held positions in the American army and the first Continental Congress.

14 *wrathful*\] Pl. \[a\]: fiery.

15 *dragon* An epithet for Pharaoh in Ezekiel 29:3.

16 *red*\] Pl. \[a\]: fierce.

P1. 4.2–11 *Solemn heave… murky atmosphere* A volcano explodes. Its flames and red clouds gradually take the form of Orc.

P1. 5.2, 6 *the terror… The Spectre* Epithets for Orc.

P1. 6 Like the American Declaration of Independence, the speech on this plate promises life \(11. 1–5\), liberty \(6–11\) and the pursuit of happiness \(12–15\).

2 Allusions to the scene at Christ’s resurrection.

3–4 *The bones of death… Reviving* In Ezekiel 37:1–10 God makes dry bones into living men.

15 *Empire is no more* Repeats the conclusion of ‘A Song of Liberty’, *MHH*, p. 195.

P1. 7.3 *Orc… serpent-form’d* See Preludium 1.15. The Angel correctly perceives that Orc is the Serpent of Rebellion against the Law of the State and the Law of God. In Pl. 8.1, Orc is wreathed around the ‘accursed tree’ of Good and Evil.

4–5 *the gate of Enitharmon… Antichrist* In Revelation 12:1–4, a dragon \(Satan or Antichrist\) stands ready to devour the child of the ‘woman clothed with the sun’.

P1. 8.3 In B.’s reading of the Book of Exodus, the motive of the exodus was Liberty. This was perverted into Law when the Ten Commandments were issued during the wandering in the wilderness.

8 *To make the desarts blossom* ‘The desert shall… blossom as the rose,’ Isaiah 35:1.

10–14 *pale religious letchery… defil’d* These lines amalgamate phrases and ideas in *MHH* Proverb 53, ‘A Song of Liberty’ \(Chorus\), and *VDA* 1.9–10, 8.10.

15–17 The fires purify humanity. B. combines the stories of Daniel unharmed in Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace \(Dan. 3:25–7\) and the King’s dream of an image with gold head, silver breast and arms, brass belly and thighs, and feet of clay \(Dan. 2:32–3\). Orc’s image is of noble metals without feet of clay.

P1. 9.1–2 Albion’s Angel calls to arms.

*Thirteen Angels* Minions of ideological repression in the colonies. But in 12.2–3 they relinquish authority and turn rebellious.

P1. 10.6–10 *Atlantean hills… Ariston* See Dictionary of Proper Names.

P1. 11.12–15 Boston’s Angel denounces the Church which preaches peace, pity and abstinence, but supports war, oppression and greed. Boston was a leading city in the pre-war opposition to English control.

P1. 13.1–2 *convene/In Bernard’s house* Sir Francis Bernard, Governor of Massachusetts Bay 1760–69. This incident is B.’s invention.

P1. 14.3–4 *thunderous command*… *plagues obedient* Satan and his followers are attacked by ‘thunders’ which inflict spiritual ‘plagues’ in *Paradise Lost* VI.836–8. Plagues are a common instrument of God’s wrath in the Old Testament.

17 The fabled Atlantis was lost by flood; this might have happened to America also. Compare Psalm 124:2–4: ‘If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us: Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul.’

20 *the plagues recoil’d\!* As in Hosea 8:7, ‘They have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind.’ The spiritual attack, intended to demoralize the Americans, recoils to produce civil disaffection in England. See next note.

P1. 15.1–15 *the Pestilence began… shame & woe* Actual conditions referred to include riots in Bristol and London, a high desertion rate, and the mental depression of George III, later to develop into insanity.

16 *the Bard of Albion* William Whitehead, who as poet laureate \(1757–85\) wrote in defence of British policy.

19 *The doors of marriage are open* The revolution brings sexual liberation also \(cf. *VDA, passim\).*

26 *a vine… the tender grape* From the springtime image in Song of Solomon 2:13, ‘the vines with the tender grape’.

P1. 16.2 *Urizen* The god of Reason and Law \(see Dictionary of Proper Names\). His snows are the propaganda of counter-revolutionary writers.

14 *twelve years* The dates referred to are disputed among commentators. Possibly from 1777, the decisive defeat of Burgoyne and the endurance of Washington’s troops through the cruel winter of Valley Forge, to 1789, the fall of the Bastille.

19 *the five gates* The five senses.

20 *blasting… mildews* Two terms in the famous curse uttered in Deuteronomy 28:22.

*Europe*

Date of publication: 1794. Twelve copies of this illuminated book are known, ten without the prefatory ‘fairy’ poem. The metre is predominantly iambic septenary, but varied by free-verse lines of shorter length.

*Europe* continues and extends the mythological mode *of America.* The poem takes place in a single ‘night’, in which the goddess ENITHARMON has dominion over her consort LOS and all their children. On earth this night is the 1800 years of spiritual error from the time of Christ to the advent of the French Revolution. Enitharmon’s dream – a poem within the poem – concentrates on the efforts of England to resist revolution. This takes up where *America* left off. At the conclusion, dawn comes and the inevitable final apocalypse approaches.

Pl. iii.1 *Five windows* Five senses.

6 *stolen joys*… *pleasant* ‘Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant’ is the invitation of the ‘foolish woman’ seductress in Proverbs 9:17.

PRELUDIUM

P1. 1.1–2.11 Nature in the Preludium laments her own endless but meaningless fertility. Her union with ORC \(in *America*\) has not yet brought redemption or transcendence for the world. She is forced to produce life, but all her creations exist in pain and mutual destruction, and even their natural vigour is thwarted by the doctrines of Enitharmon.

A PROPHECY

P1. 3.1–4 The birth of Christ \(identified with Orc in this poem\). The lines parallel and parody Milton’s ‘On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity’ in metre and theme. Milton celebrates the peace which descends on Nature, and the rout of paganism, at the nativity. B. acknowledges these events \(1. 4\) but to him it is a false dawn.

7 *Los, possessor of the moon* The proper roles of the sexes are reversed. Los should be a vigorous sun-god. Here he is only Enitharmon’s consort, indulging in irresponsible hedonism.

P1. 4.10–13 *Arise O Orc*… *thou art bound* Orc \(Rebellion\), son of Los and Enitharmon, has been ‘bound’ by his parents \(the full story is in *FZ* v, pp. 59–62\). The allusions are to Christ crucified. Thus, to crown him with garlands is a mockery; the ‘hour of bliss’ is blissful for Los, not Orc.

P1. 6.5 Following the death of Christ, Enitharmon directs her sons to establish official Christianity, a religion in which female principles will dominate through the teaching of virgin-worship, repression of sexuality and promises of heaven for the passively virtuous.

Pl. 9.6–Pl. 13.8 The ‘episode’ of Enitharmon’s dream, which in this world is historical reality for 1,800 years.

P1. 9.8 *Albions Angel smitten* Takes up where *America* leaves off \(c. 1780\). Britain is responding to the American war and the threat of revolution.

12 *the council house; down rushing* Parliament collapses.

P1. 10.2–5 *his ancient temple serpent-form’d… Verulam* Conservative policy reverts to the ancient spirit of DRUIDISM, supposedly the archaic religion of England. In the following passage, B. describes a supposed Druid temple, then traces this religion to man’s fall from ‘the infinite’ into a finite material world.

10–15 *the five senses whelm’d… infinite* B. interprets the biblical Flood as a flood of materialism. With limited material senses, man can no longer behold ‘the infinite’, and so his world too becomes finite.

21–3 Druid religion was the outcome and image of Man’s fallen and limited world after the Flood.

26–30 *the Stone of Night… attractive north* Man’s mind, once free and open to light and warmth \(south\), is now enclosed in a cave-like skull and sunk in wintry rationality \(north\). We are cosmically inverted, like Nature in the Preludium, mistakenly thinking that ‘north’ is ‘up’ and ‘south’ is ‘down’.

P1. 12.4 *For Urizen unclaspd his Book\!* As in *VDA* and *America*, URIZEN is the tyrant-god of Reason, ultimately responsible for all earthly repression.

5–13 The young are taught repressive doctrines, but they know the old order is failing.

15 *The Guardian of the secret codes* Chancellor Thurlow, dismissed 17 June 1792 \(Erdman\).

23–4 *Palambron shot… Rintrah hung* Enitharmon’s sons have become Burke and Pitt, defending the old order \(Erdman\).

P1. 13.1 *The red limb’d Angel* Albion’s Angel, now desperate.

5 *Newton… enormous blast\!* Newtonian rationalism is the true philosophical basis for anti-radical policy.

6–8 A surprise ending. The radicals are not suppressed. Instead, the counter-revolutionary forces are revealed to be dead leaves awaiting extinction. These lines ironically parallel the rout of the pagan gods in Milton’s ‘Nativity Ode’.

Pl. 13.9-Pl. 14.32 *Then Enitharmon woke… She ceas’d* Enitharmon is unaware of the approaching apocalypse. Her song invokes, in her children, sexual attributes intended to maintain the dominion of‘lovely Woman’ \(6.3\).

P1. 14. 32 *for All were forth at sport*\] Mended in the copper from ‘and all went forth to sport’.

35–6 The advent of dawn ends Enitharmon’s dominion.

35 *the eastern gate*\] Variant proof sheet adds: ‘and the angel trumpet blew\!’

P1. 14.37-Pl. 15.2 Orc is released from Enitharmon’s power. The French Revolution begins.

P1. 15.1 *of Enitharmon*\] Variant proof sheet adds: ‘before the Trumpet blew’.

9 *Then Los arose* Los as sun-god and prophet resumes his rightful role.

*The Song of Los*

Date of publication: 1795, but probably composed before *The Book of Urizen* \(dated 1794\). An illuminated book known in five copies.

     The poem is in two parts, ‘Africa’ and ‘Asia’. *America* and *Europe* should be understood as coming between them, in historical sequence.

    ‘Africa’ outlines religious and intellectual history from Adam and Noah to Rousseau and Voltaire, and concludes with a world ripe for revolution. ‘Asia’ presents the cynical self-justification of kings, describes a retreating URIZEN \(Tyranny\) and an advancing ORC \(Revolution\), and concludes with a resurrection of the dead. ‘Africa’ is in free verse, ‘Asia’ primarily in a rough trimeter.

AFRICA

P1. 3.2 *four harps* The four continents Africa, Asia, Europe, America.

8–9 LOS is the ‘Spirit of Prophecy’. His children embody the evolution of that spirit through history. The tyrant-god URIZEN imposes his will through their means, as they shape men’s thoughts. In the following passage, Rintrah, Palamabron, Oothoon and Leutha, Sotha and Diralada are the children of Los. See Dictionary of Proper Names for their individual characters.

11 *Abstract Philosophy to Brama* In Sir William Jones’s *Asiatic Researches* \(1788\), Brahma is abstract and logical \(Raine\).

18–19 *Trismegistus*… *Pythagoras Socrates & Plato* Hermes Trismegistus, supposed divine author of the Hermetic Books \(treating magic, astrology and alchemy\), is grouped with the major mystic or idealist Greek philosophers.

20 *the sons of Har* All Mankind. See *Tiriel.*

20–21 *time after time… chain’d down* ORC is the Promethean rebel and sufferer. The ‘Orc cycle’ \(Frye’s term\), in which revolutionary energy is thwarted and punished, repeats time after time in history.

22–4 Jesus hears the cry of liberty and love, but accepts a gospel of passive suffering \(see *VDA*\).

29 *a loose Bible* The Koran.

30 *Odin… a Code of War* This completes the catalogue of repressive philosophies and religions given to the nations – the East, the Hebrews, the Greeks, Christian Europe, the Mohammedans and the Germanic tribes.

P1. 4.21\] This line opens *America* which should sequentially follow.



ASIA

P1. 6.1–2 This takes up where *Europe* leaves off. The revolutionary impulse is spreading from Europe to Asia.

3–4 *Web… Den* The Web of Religion; the Den of Materialism.

9 *Shall not the King call* Hereafter follows a catalogue of English devices, some publicly discussed, some actually enforced, for quelling dissent and the ambitions of the poor. \(See Erdman, 284–5.\)

P1. 7.9–23 Urizen retreats to his stronghold, Hebrew Religion, but finds it dead. Books of brass, iron and gold are texts of Law, War and Economics.

27–8 *pillar of fire… serpent of fiery flame* Symbols of escape from tyranny \(Exodus 13:21–2\) and healing of plague \(Numbers 21:5–9\).

29 *sullen Earth* ‘Like to the lark at break of day arising/From sullen earth,’ Shakespeare, Sonnet 29.

31–2 *rattling bones to bones/join* From the resurrection of the dry bones in Ezekiel 37.

35–6 As life is renewed, the grave becomes sexually procreative.

42 *Urizen Wept* ‘Jesus wept’ \(John 11:35, shortest verse in the Bible\) before the raising of Lazarus. Cf. ‘A Song of Liberty’, *MHH* 25.8.



*The \(First\) Book of Urizen*

Date of publication: 1794. This illuminated book is known in seven copies containing from twenty-four to twenty-eight plates, with some variation in the order. Copies \[a\] and \[g\] delete ‘First’ from the poem’s title. Copy \[a\] has several significant deletions and emendations.

*The Book of Urizen* is B.’s ironic version of the biblical Book of Genesis. It is also the locus for his mythology in ‘A Song of Liberty’, *VDA, America, Europe, The Song of Los, The Book of Ahania* and *The Book of Los*, all of which rest on the ideas presented in this poem. The story is as follows: URIZEN – a god of Reason who separates himself from the other Eternals, demands obedience to his self-proclaimed principles, and falls into Chaos – is an abstract, vain and punitive deity. A body is created for him by LOS, ‘the Eternal Prophet’ or Divine Imagination. But Los, exhausted, divides into male \(Los\) and female \(ENIT HARMON\). Their child ORC \(Rebellious Energy\) is born but immediately chained to a rock. Urizen then explores his deadly world, and mankind shrinks up from Eternity. Finally, some of Urizen’s children begin an exodus.

It is important to note that the Creation and the Fall are, for B., one event. This event occurs in stages, each of which shows unity lapsing into duality and spiritual energy lapsing into material passivity. Humanity as we know it appears only at the very end of a long cataclysmic process, and is – from the point of view of Eternity – almost wholly pathetic.

Many of the ideas in this poem also occur in neo-Platonic, gnostic and alchemic teachings, and in the work of Jacob Boehme. There are numerous verbal echoes of Milton’s *Paradise Lost*, mostly ironic in intent.

The metre of this and the following two poems is a rough anapestic trimeter.



CHAPTER 1

The Fall of Urizen; his formation of Chaos.

P1. 3.1–20 *Unknown, unprolific, repelling, void, vacuum, unseen, secret*, etc. The character of Urizen is defined by abstractions and negations for two reasons: \(1\) From the point of view of Eternity, Urizen is unreal; \(2\) only an isolated ‘Reason’ can invent abstract and negative terms. In a full reality, such terms would have no meaning. Note that Milton’s God is praised by the angels for being ‘invisible’ and ‘thron’d inaccessible’ \(*Paradise Lost* 111.375–7\). B. condemns such qualities in a deity, and mocks them by exaggeration.

11 *In his*\] Changed from ‘Like’ in copy \[g\],

27–8 *His cold horrors… Urizen/Prepar’d* Urizen is always seen by B. as a winter god, like the Winter of *PS*, p. 23.



CHAPTER II

Eternity before the Fall; its initial disruption by Urizen’s announcement of his principles.

36 In Eternity there are no spheres \(such as planets, moons, stars, etc.\) subject to the law of gravity.

37–8 Eternity is non-Newtonian. Expansion and contraction are by will, not by the law of gravity.

40–41 Details from the mustering of angelic armies in *Paradise Lost* VI.55–60.

44 *myriads of Eternity* Myriads of Eternals. Line deleted in copy \[a\].

P1. 4\] This plate is lacking in four copies.

10–13 This speech gives Urizen’s motivation. It is intended to sound reasonable, as Urizen is Reason. *Why will you die O Eternals?* is from ‘Why will ye die, O house of Israel?’ \(Ezekiel 18:31, 33:11\). But he does not see that joy and pain are necessary contraries for a living existence, that ‘a solid without fluctuation’ is dead, and that the burning fires of’the enjoyments of Genius’ only appear like ‘torment and insanity’ to those who do not understand them *\(MHH*, p. 182\).

14 *I fought with the fire* Urizen fights the fire of passion within himself.

18 *self balanc’d stretch’d o’er the void* ‘And the earth was without form and void’ \(Genesis 1:2\); ‘And Earth self-balanc’d on her Center hung’ *Paradise Lost* VII.242.

19 *I alone, even I\!* The egotism of Urizen echoes at once the biblical Jehovah \(‘I am the Lord thy God,’ Exodus 20:2\) and the Miltonic Satan.

30 *Seven deadly Sins* Urizen’s own invention. Line deleted in copy \[c\].

34–5 A *Law* of peace, or of love, etc., is a contradiction.

40 ‘Thou shalt have no other gods before me’ \(Exodus 20:3\). Milton’s God promises, after ‘long obedience… One Kingdom’ \(*Paradise Lost* VII.159–61\).



CHAPTER III

Urizen is rejected by Eternity and confined in a black globe \(Chaos\).

49 *All the seven deadly sins*\] Line deleted in copy \[a\].

P1. 5.1–2\] Lines deleted in copy \[a\].

3–4 *Sund’ring… Rent away* The Fall \(of God or Man\) is always understood by B. as a division. The *division* of Urizen from the hosts of Eternity has ironically resulted from his attempts to enforce a fixed and static *unity.*

16 Line erased in copy \[a\].

17 *no light from the fires* Detail from Milton’s Hell, *Paradise Lost* 1.61–3.

20 *he*\] Changed from‘they’, here and in 11. 21, 22, 23, 29, all copies. Capitalized only in copy \[a\]. The alteration gives Urizen sole responsibility.

21 *combining* Re-uniting with the‘self-begotten armies’, 1.16 above.

22 *He dug mountains* Detail from Milton’s war in Heaven, *Paradise Lost* VI. 630–69.

28–37 *a roof… like a womb… like a black globe… like a human heart… world of Urizen* The images are confused because Urizen’s world is ‘unorganiz’d’ \(6.8\) and ‘formless’ \(7.9\).

Pl. 6.2–4 *Los wept… Urizen was rent* Los is the power of poetic imagination. If Imagination is separated from Reason, both are drastically wounded. Los is in anguish because he has lost his Mind.



CHAPTER IV \[A\]

P1. 8 Composed after Pl. 10, probably originally intended to replace it.

1–2 *Los… Frightend* Los took fright.

2–4 *hurtling bones… surging… raging* Urizen is asleep or dead from the point of view of Eternity. This means he has become a chaos of disorganized motion. His elements \(sulphur, pitch, nitre\) suggest that he has become a hell; his mind is ‘sulphureous’ \(8.3, 10.14, 10.21\) because sulphur is a primal formative element in alchemical theory.



CHAPTER IV \[B\]

Los creates a body for Urizen. This is a parody of the seven days of creation in Genesis. Though necessary to save Urizen from Chaos, it constricts and shrinks his original powers.

P1. 10.15 Los is now for the first time called ‘the Eternal Prophet’. In Eternity there is no need for Prophecy because there is no Time. Time belongs to the fallen world, and is a necessity for it. Hence Los divides the night into ‘watches’ and creates ‘hours, days and years’ by the repeated beat of his blacksmith’s hammer – which is a metaphor for the metre of poetry.

19–23 *The eternal mind*… *White as the snow* An allusion to the *tabula rasa* of Lockean psychology, a ‘blank slate’ empty of intrinsic ideas, capable only of receiving and combining external impressions. Urizen’s mind should not be blank, but is becoming so.

33 *a roof shaggy wild* The skull covered with hair.

P1. 11.2–6 *a red/Round globe… ten thousand branches* The heart and blood vessels.

11 *brain shot branches* The nervous system.

P1. 13.6 *A craving Hungry Cavern* The digestive system.



CHAPTER V

The division into male and female.

40 Los falls into exhaustion and despair with Urizen.

51–2 *Pity began… dividing* As Urizen divided himself from the other Eternals, so now Los will divide into male \(strong, active\) and female \(weak, passive\). This division does not exist in Eternity. Here it indicates passive helplessness in the face of disaster.

P1. 18.1 *The globe of life blood* The female is created from a fluid, rather than a solid rib.



CHAPTER VI

The world of Generation and the birth of Orc.

P1. 19.13 *She fled* Eve at first flees Adam in *Paradise Lost* IV.477–82.

20 *a Worm* An embryo.

44 *Delving earth… resistless* Digging through the mother’s body… irresistible.



CHAPTER VII

The binding of Orc; the rousing of Urizen.

P1. 20.9 *A tight’ning girdle* Los feels heart-constricting jealousy.

23 The infant Oedipus was abandoned on a mountainside because of an oracle that he would kill his father and marry his mother. B.’s version of the Oedipus myth combines the theme of incest-threat with the idea of adult authority restricting youthful energy.



CHAPTER VIII

Urizen explores his dens, curses his children, and establishes Religion.

Urizen’s dens signify the world of Materialism. His exploration parallels the journey of Satan through Chaos, *Paradise Lost* 11. The Web of Religion he leaves trailing behind him parallels the highway built by Sin and Death in Satan’s track, *Paradise Lost* 11.1024–9. The episode is greatly expanded in *FZ* Night the Sixth.

Pl. 23.11–17 *Thiriel… Utha… Grodna… Fuzon* Urizen’s four sons are the four elements air, water, earth, fire.

27 *life liv’d upon death* In a fallen world, everything lives on something else \(the Ox is food\) and what one appropriates, another lacks \(the Dog goes hungry\). Laws of unity are impossible in such a world.

P1. 25.18 *the Web is a Female in embrio* That is, a nascent Church? B. consistently makes Churches female. The line is deleted in copy \[a\].

22 *The Net of Religion* A second enclosure for mankind, like the Tent of Science \(Pl. 19\).



CHAPTER IX

Human history begins.

23–39 *the Inhabitants… shrunk up* Primitive mankind recapitulates the constriction and shrinking of Urizen’s divine senses.

32–3 *woven hipocrisy… streaky slime* The‘Net of Religion’.

38 *seven feet stature* ‘There were giants in the earth in those days’ \(Genesis 6:4\).

43–4 *thirty cities… human heart* ‘Heart-form’d Africa’ \(*SL* 3.3\) is the cradle of civilization.

P1. 28.19–22 Fuzon is Moses leading the Exodus from Egypt.



*The Book of Ahania*

Date of publication: 1795. Only, one copy of this book \(printed in intaglio rather than B.’s usual relief etching\) and some scattered prints of individual plates are known.

*Ahania* is Blake’s version of the biblical Book of Exodus. This ironic and bitter narrative, which tells the failure of Man’s first attempt to rebel against the god of Reason, follows directly from *The Book of Urizen.* Fuzon \(Moses\) attacks God, is slain by a rock which then becomes Mt Sinai, and is crucified on a Tree of Mystery. His corpse, seemingly alive, sheds pestilence throughout the forty years’ wandering in the wilderness, until the Israelites reach the Promised Land \(here called Asia, 4.41\). The impulse to liberty has been thwarted successfully, and the poem concludes with the lament of Urizen’s female ‘soul’, the once-beloved, now-deserted Ahania.



CHAPTER I

The rebellion of Fuzon \(Exodus\).

P1. 2.1 *Fuzon* URIZEN’S fiery rebel-son *\(BU* 23.17–18\) is Moses in the historical allegory. He also recalls Prometheus; Christ; David attacking Goliath; David’s own rebellious son Absalom; and Blake’s contemporary, the revolutionary Robespierre, whose policy of violence against the enemies of freedom was ultimately turned against himself.

30–34 As Urizen is wounded in the loins, his female aspect, Ahania, divides from him \(cf. the division of Los and Enitharmon, *BU* v\). Instantly lustful and jealous, but also anguished by this revelation of his own sexuality, he calls her Sin. In *Paradise Lost* Sin springs from Satan’s brow and he afterwards copulates with her.

45 *a pillar of fire* Orc is a pillar of fire in *SL* 7.27; see note.



CHAPTER II

The revenge of Urizen \(foundation of Mt Sinai\).

P1. 3.16 *Oak* Associated with the Druids and their cult of human sacrifice.

38 *lam God. said he* As in ‘The Grey Monk’, Pickering MS., p. 505: ‘The iron hand \[i.e., of rebellion\] crushd the Tyrants head/And became a Tyrant in his stead.’



CHAPTER III

Crucifixion of Fuzon on the Tree of Mystery.

54–62 *A Tree*… *Mystery* The first appearance in B.’s prophetic books of the TREE OF MYSTERY.

64 *book of iron* A code of war.



CHAPTER IV

The wandering in the wilderness.

P1. 4.9–10 *Forth flew the arrows… tree* Fuzon is dead, but the pestilence-emitting parasites that live on his body, as on an originally vital religion, are ‘alive’. Their origin is explained \(in ll. 11–35, which re-tell the story of the binding of Urizen, from *BU* IV\): they are ‘effluvia’ of Urizen’s brain.



CHAPTER V

The lament of Ahania concludes the poem. She recalls life in Eternity, where male and female were one. Then, Reason was vigorous and fructifying, and Ahania was fertile. Now she is deserted and barren. The conclusion recalls ‘Earth’s Answer’, *SE*, p. 118.



*The Book of Los*

Date of publication: 1795. Printed by the same method as *Ahania.* One copy – plus a single print of Pl. 4 – is known. The poem begins with a prelude on a Golden Age when ‘sins’ were not sinful because they were not forbidden. At 3.27, the narrative is interrupted, and the story intersects with *BU* IV, to give another treatment of the Creation from Los’s point of view.



CHAPTER I

Prelude; the rage of Los.

P1. 3.31-Pl. 4.10 *The Eternal Prophet… senses* LOS is surrounded by flames of desire \(his desire to act\) but is chained and forced to guard the fallen Urizen. As he rejects the fires, they turn cold and congeal around him like marble.



CHAPTER II

The fall of Los; creation of the elements.

19 *The Prophetic wrath* Los’s wrath is impatient and forceful, but lacks form and direction \(he repelled his flames of desire\), hence he falls.

42 *his downward-borne fall chang’d oblique* In Lucretius’ *De Rerum Natura*, creation starts when indefinitely falling atoms go through a *clinamen* or swerve.

47 *wafting* Floating on water or air. In *Paradise Lost* 11.1041–2 Satan, emerging from chaos ‘with less toil, and now with ease/Wafts…’

50–52 *the Vacuum/Became element… to rise… fall… swim… fly* The four elements fire, earth, water, air, appear in the vacuum.



CHAPTER III

Material creation continues: solid, liquid and fire divide.

57 *Polypus* A floating, formless sea-creature such as a jellyfish.

P1. 5.3 *He rose on the floods* ‘the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters’, Genesis 1:2.



CHAPTER IV

Light appears; Los forges the sun; the binding of Urizen.

10 *Then Light first began* ‘And there was light’, Genesis 1:3.

34–5 *An immense Orb of fire… he quench’d it* Los creates the sun and starts it on its cycle of rising and setting.

44–5 *the sun… self-balanc’d* ‘And Earth self-balanc’d on her Center hung’, *Paradise Lost* VII.242.

48 *the Deep fled away* ‘The loud misrule of Chaos far remov’d’, *Paradise Lost* VII.271–2.

53 *four rivers* The four rivers of Paradise \(Genesis 2:10–14\) are also Urizen’s major blood vessels.

56 *Human Illusion* Our reality is only illusion from the point of view of Eternity.



*Vala, or the Four Zoas*

Blake’s first attempt at a long epic poem exists in the form of a much-revised manuscript of 132 pages inscribed on seventy large sheets \(mostly drawing paper or proof sheets for Young’s *Night Thoughts*, which B. was commissioned to illustrate in 1794\) plus two small sheets and a fragment. Its theme is a cosmic history of Mankind and his universe, from initial collapse and division among his primal energies, to final regeneration. In its first form the poem was called *Vala*, was in nine ‘Nights’ like Young’s *Night Thoughts*, and may be dated *c.* 1797–1803. Revisions, including both major and minor deletions, erasures, transpositions and additions, sometimes written in margins or squeezed between lines or in stanza-breaks, seem to have continued until 1808 or beyond, during which time the poem also became a quarry of ideas and passages for *Milton* and *Jerusalem.* Night VIII, and the alteration of the title to *The Four Zoas*, date at least from 1804, and may be considerably later. In general, the revisions reflect an expanded mythology and symbolism. The splicings, however, are not always smooth, and the correct order of the leaves is still conjectural in places. In the present text, although most of the legible deleted material is retained \(in brackets and italicized\), it is impossible to indicate the complexity of layers and phases of B.’s re-writing. For full discussion of this manuscript, see the following editions:

H. M. Margoliouth \(ed.\), *Vala* \(Oxford University Press, 1956\); an attempt to disentangle the poem’s initial version from the later additions.

NIGHT THE FIRST

The Fall of Man: Chaos.

The basic mythology behind *The Four Zoas* is as follows: Man \(the Ancient Man, or ALBION\) lives in Eternity or EDEN, as one of a divine family of Eternals who collectively compose One Man, Christ. Man himself is composed of four ZOAS: URIZEN \(his Reason\), LUVAH \(his Passion\), THARMAS \(his Sensation\) and URTHONA \(his Instinct\). Each of these figures has a female counterpart or EMANATION, but in Eden male and female are one, and the Zoas live in unity.

Prior to the poem’s opening, Man’s separation from Eden has already begun. Man has become passive instead of active. His Zoas are divided. Urizen and Luvah each have tried to seize absolute power – Urizen by refusing to serve Man, Luvah by seducing him with the female counterpart VALA, and by usurping Urizen’s steeds of light. Tharmas and Urthona are also drawn into the disastrous conflict. All four Zoas ‘fall’ and carry Man with them. Furthermore, Man and his Zoas become separated from their female counterparts. The whole of *The Four Zoas* will be occupied with the results of this initial trauma – periodically recalled in various versions by various figures involved – from which issues our entire cosmos, and all of human history until Man’s final regeneration and return to divine unity at the close of the final Night.

It should be emphasized that the Fall is not a moral lapse from ‘good’ to ‘evil’. Morality, for Blake, is merely something Urizen attempts to impose on others. Rather, the Fall means a lapse from unity, vigour and the life of the imagination, to alienation, compulsion or passivity, and the deadness of material objects. Thus one final set of names must be mentioned: the names of those levels of human consciousness or potential which B. treats spatially as realms or lands, and through which his characters may ascend or descend. EDEN is his Heaven, Man’s permanent home. It is ‘fourfold’ and ‘human’. BEULAH, a step below, is a lower paradise, a passive resting place from the energetic life of Eden, humanity’s dreamland and the source of all poetic inspiration. It is ‘threefold’ and ‘sexual’. GENERATION is the cycle of life and death for all living things – our normal world. It is ‘twofold’ and ‘vegetative’. ULRO, finally, is Hell: the condition of dead and barren mechanism and materialism, inorganic, meaningless and hopeless.

The poem itself begins in midst of catastrophe with the quarrelling division and fall of THARMAS and ENION. Tharmas becomes a sea of incoherence. Enion weaves the SPECTRE of Tharmas, while the Daughters of Beulah create a space for the Circle of Destiny and close Tharmas’s Gate of the Tongue. Enion, ravished by the spectre, gives birth to LOS and ENITHARMON. They are the fallen form of Urthona, and represent Prophecy and the Muse in the fallen world. They quarrel, she taunting him with a song of Vala which hints that Luvah and Vala have caused Man’s fall, and claiming female dominance. Los strikes her and prophesies suffering and punishment, but she allies herself with Urizen, who then assumes Godhead and presides over their discontented nuptial feast. The song at this feast celebrates War and prophesies future events. Meanwhile, the rejected Enion laments the sufferings endured by all natural creatures.

The Night concludes with a full account of Man’s Fall given to the Council of God in Eternity, and the election of the SEVEN EYES OF GOD who are to guard Man, while Beulah guards Man’s emanation, JERUSALEM. Historically, this entire Night is to be understood as occurring prior to the Creation in Genesis 1.

P. 3.6 *Four Mighty Ones* The Four Zoas, Man’s Energies. John 17:21–3: ‘That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.’ John 1:14: ‘And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, \(and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father\), full of grace and truth.’ The Greek quotation repeats: ‘and dwelt among us’.

*Four* signifies perfection in B.’s numerology: Man is composed of four Zoas, Eden is fourfold, and ‘fourfold vision’ is the ‘supreme delight’ available to the visionary. The immediate reference is to the four beasts which surround the chariot of the Almighty in Ezekiel, and the four living creatures \(Z![Image](images/000010.jpg)α\) around the throne of God in Revelation. But similar symbolism occurs in other traditions; for example, the sacred quaternion which is the source of eternal nature in Pythagoras, the fourfold worlds based on the Tetragrammaton \(sacred name of God, composed of four letters\) in Kaballah, the fourfold systems of Ptolemy’s gnosticism, of Rosicrucianism, and of Boehme, the four suits of the Tarot deck, the four elements, the four humours; and there are obvious correspondences to the four seasons and the four compass points.

11 *Los was the fourth immortal starry one* In Daniel 3:25 ‘the form of the fourth is like the Son of God’, and is sent to save the three men cast into the fiery furnace. So Urthona–Los, the spirit of Poetry in this fallen world, will work to save it.

P1. 3.13–Pl. 4.1 *Urthona*… *In Eden* In Eden, Man’s original home, Urthona was the creator of playful inventions \(‘Fairies of Albion’\) which were received by Man’s ear \(‘Auricular Nerves’\) as by a fertile earth. But in the fallen world these fairies become awesome and dreadful gods, systematically worshipped.

4*Daughter of Beulah Sing* The epic invocation of the Muse.

5 B. here announces the theme of his epic.

8 *Begin with Tharmas* An epic opening *in medias res.* The quarrel between Tharmas and Enion is a by-product of the greater Fall of Man in which they are involuntarily trapped. Left to themselves Tharmas and Enion are Earth Father and Earth Mother, honest, simple, receptive and coherent. Beyond their ken, Urizen \(Reason\) and Luvah \(Passion\) are striving to control Man. Man is divided, and his feminine portions have fled to Tharmas for refuge. This produces panic in Tharmas and jealousy in Enion; their love turns to analysis and accusation, their self-respect to masochism, and they too are divided – not to reunite until the end of the epic.

19 *Thy fear*… *surrounded me* \(repeated in *f* 21.1\) An ironic speech. Tharmas himself is fearful, and has infected Enion with fear. But she believes him to be a God, as in Psalm 88:14–17: ‘Lord, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?… while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted… thy terrors have cut me off. They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.’ An additional irony is that Tharmas will degenerate into water as a result of this quarrel.

20–35 Portions of these lines reappear in *f* 22.

26 *Hide me some shadowy semblance* Enion begs a retreat from reality to illusion. Autobiographically the issue is B.’s confusion about publishing radical writings, and Catherine’s \(or his own\) fear of repercussions if he does so openly. ‘Shadowy semblance’ would mean a ‘literary’ disguise less terrifying and dangerous than plain speech \(see Erdman, 272–8\).

P. 5.6 *So saying* Enion divides from Tharmas, and hereafter is purely passive.

6–7 *weaving soft… A tabernacle* Enion weaves the generated body on a ‘Loom of Vegetation’ \(6.1–2\); the loom is a neo-Platonic symbol for generation.

11 *Turnd round the circle of Destiny* Tharmas accepts his fate, sets Destiny in motion, and collapses from coherence into a formless sea. Hereafter he is Chaos or the Flood.

17 *lacteal* Lymph vessel.

23 *Nine days* In neo-Platonic commentary, ‘nine’ is a number of incompletion. Blake consistently uses ‘three’, ‘nine’ and their multiples to indicate phases of a fallen world.

25–6 *Round rolld the Sea… appeard* ‘And God said, let the waters… be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear’ \(Genesis 1:9\); ‘And Earth self-balanc’d on her Center hung’ \(*Paradise Lost* VII.242\).

29–43 This passage, introducing Beulah, is a late addition. It is rewritten and expanded in *M* 30.

35 *Creating Spaces* The creation of protective spaces for fallen beings is the work of females throughout B.’s prophecies.

38–9 *The Spectre… Deformd* The idea is repeated in *FZ* VII \[a\] 84.36–7. *f* 33.4.

39 *the three heavens* Beulah is ‘threefold’ and restful and has three heavens. Eden, in contrast, is ‘fourfold’ and energetic.

P. 7.21 *they join in burning anguish* The copulation of Enion and the spectre of Tharmas is a monstrous mingling of unlike physical bodies, rather than the complete union enjoyed by male and female in Eden.

22 *high she soard* Compare Eve’s Satan-inspired dream of soaring to heaven \(*Paradise Lost* v.86–7\).

31 *Enion brooded* She \(1\) pondered, \(2\) prepared children for birth. This ambiguous usage is from *Paradise Lost* 1.21: ‘Dove-like satst brooding on the vast abyss.’

P. 8.2 *Behold two little Infants* The birth of Los and Enitharmon.

8 *But those in Great Eternity*\] This deleted scene returns on P. 21.

12–19 Enion as Earth Mother produces ‘tree yielding fruit’, ‘winged fowl’ and ‘beasts of the earth’, as in Genesis 1:12–24.

P. 9.9–13 This act recurs in *f* 48.30–39.

19 *But Los & Enitharmon delighted* Los and Enitharmon now represent Creative Energy perverted by lack of social purpose. As a gloss on their characters at this stage one may consider the incestuous or quasi-incestuous, sullen and destructive lovers in such novels as *Wuthering Heights, Women in Love* and *The Sound and the Fury.*

P. 10.9 *Hear\! I will sing a Song of Death\!* Enitharmon taunts Los with her version of Man’s Fall, in which the female takes dominance over the male.

10 *The Fallen Man* Albion. His sleep of Reason, turning away from ‘the Universal Vision’ \(1.23\), allowed Passion to triumph. His following speech shows submission to the female.

13 *Luvah siez’d the Horses of Light* The usurpation of the head \(Reason\) by the heart \(Passion\) parallels the myth of Phaethon disastrously driving the chariot of the Sun.

P. 11.21–3 *I see… Luvah… the shower of blood* Los prophesies the incarnation and crucifixion of Christ in the form of Luvah.

30–31 *Descend O Urizen… Threaten not me O visionary* Enitharmon invokes Reason as ally, and rejects Prophecy.

P. 12.8 *Now I am God* Here begins Urizen’s reign, confirming the Fall of Man.

14 *The prince of Love the murderer* Urizen claims that Luvah has slain Man.

32–3 *Ten thousand thousand… hosts… Chariots* In *Paradise Lost* VI.767–70, God’s victory over the rebel angels is ‘Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints… And twenty thousand… Chariots’.

35 *Rejoicing in the Victory* The victory of Urizen over the other Zoas, and his dominance of Man.

37 *the golden feast* The marriage feast of Los and Enitharmon.

38–9 *But the bright Sun… blue shell* ‘… for yet the Sun/Was not; she in a cloudy Tabernacle/Sojourn’d the while’ \(*Paradise Lost* VII.247–9\).

44 A black and cannibalistic Mass; Los and Enitharmon are feasting upon Humanity.

P. 13.8–9 *Eternity… One Man… In Luvahs robes of blood* A vision of Christ incarnate and crucified.

P. 14.6 *And This the Song\!* The wedding feast of Los and Enitharmon is celebrated by a song of the values of War triumphant.

7 *Ephraim… Zion* The two mountains represent the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. Biblical allusions are a relatively late addition to *FZ* and develop from B.’s idea that all nations were originally one in Albion. Thus the ‘Promised Land’ of the Bible becomes a separate geographical entity only because of the Fall.

20 *plat* Plait.

P. 15.7–8 *Luvah* & *Vala ride/Triumphant* War is Passion uncontrolled.

8 *the Human form is no more* This concludes the rejoicing of Mount Ephraim. The Demons of the Deep then continue the song, first with their version of strife and collapse among the Zoas, then with a prophecy of the future.

9–19 *The listning Stars… dark confusion* A condensed and confused version of the Fall: the Stars \(Urizen’s troops\) hear the rejoicing at Luvah’s War. Urizen prepares for battle \(the sun prepares to rise\). Tharmas the shepherd \(‘Mighty Father’\) angrily swings his sheephook through the sky, and all rushes downwards to devastation.

11–12 *his Horse… smelt the battle/Afar off* In Job 39:25 the horse ‘smelleth the battle afar off’.

P. 15.20-P. 16.12 *Hark I hear the hammers*… *rage in vain* The song now predicts the suffering of Luvah in the ‘Furnaces of Affliction’ \(11 pp. 25–40\); his birth in the form of Orc from Enitharmon’s womb \(v.P.58.17\); and his subsequent fettering \(v.P60.6-P61.9\).

15–16 *Urizen/With faded radiance sighed* Parallels the description of the fallen Satan, *Paradise Lost* 1. 591–602.

P. 18.11–12 *Now Man was come… Beulah* A palm tree \(Judges 4:5\) and an Oak of Weeping \(Genesis 35:8\) are mentioned in connection with Bethel, where the journeying patriarch Jacob rested his head on a stone, dreamed of the ladder of angels, and received God’s promise to him. Man at the edge of Beulah is likewise at the border of the land of divine dreams. He sinks outside it into Generation.

13–15 Albion’s decline to the Rock of Ages is also in *f* 48. 1–4.

P. 21.2–6 *As one Man… in Eden the land of life* A parallel description of the Divine Family is in *f* 34.17–20.

7 *Snowdon* A mountain in Wales, home of traditional bards. Erdman \(288, n. 9\) notes that a group of English radicals retired under pressure to Wales in 1797. \(The rejected reading, ‘Mount Gilead’, indicates that in Eternity the holy nations of Albion and Israel were one. Thus British and biblical place-names are interchangeable.\)

12 *Luvah & Urizen contend in war* The Fall of Man was produced by conflict between Reason and Passion. However, here and hereafter, so far as the political allegory of *The Four Zoas* is concerned, one sense of Luvah is ‘France’, one sense of Urizen is ‘England’. The two nations were at war almost continuously from 1793 to 1815.

15 *Conways Vale* The setting of Gray’s ‘The Bard’, also in Wales.

16 *The Eternal Man wept* The messengers here give B.’s ‘Authorized Version’ of Albion’s Fall. While Man is passive, Urizen and Luvah contend for dominance over him; Urthona in shock falls, dividing into Los, Enitharmon and the Spectre; the jealousy between Tharmas and Enion takes place; all the Zoas fall together; this also constitutes the ‘ruin’ of Jerusalem, Albion’s emanation.

19 *& thus conferrd* Details of the Urizen–Luvah belligerencies may derive from English–French negotiations and mutual demands of 1796–7, and Napoleon’s assumption of power \(Erdman, 284–6\).

23 *deep in the North* Urizen’s proper realm in Eternity is the South. His plan to usurp the North follows the account of Satan in *Paradise Lost* v.689 and Isaiah 14:13.

P. 22.25–6 *such thing was never known… revivd* Repeated with alterations in *f* 80.23–4.

P. 19.9–10 *Seven/Eyes of God*… *lamps* These are guardians of fallen mankind, each presiding over a historic cycle. The imagery derives from Zachariah 4:10 and Revelations 4:5. The idea is systematically developed in Night VIII and in *M* 13.14–27, *f* 55.31–8.

13 *mount Ephraim*… *a Sepulcher* The region of Ephraim, in north central Palestine, revolted against Solomon and formed, with Israel, the northern kingdom. In Psalm 78 God is praised for his persistent forgiveness despite the persistent rebellion of the people, and Ephraim is singled out as a ringleader of apostasy. Another possible reference may be to Jesus’ flight to Ephraim after the raising of Lazarus. Ironically, Albion ‘wanders’ – the term implies ‘strayed’ – in Ephraim seeking death.

P. 20.1 *The Daughters of Beulah beheld the Emanation* Albion’s emanation, Jerusalem, has fallen with him.

4 *Three gates within* Enitharmon has perversely closed the gates of her heart, brain and loins against Los. These gates lead to Beulah and thence to Eternity. A turning point in the poem therefore will be the bursting of her heart gate, beginning in v.63.11–12.

12–13 *the Eternal Wheels… living creatures* The vision of the heavenly wheels of four living creatures is in Ezekiel 1.



NIGHT THE SECOND

The rule of Reason; creation of the Mundane Shell.

Albion surrenders all his power to Urizen. Urizen creates the MUNDANE SHELL \(the heavens\), while Man degenerates. The nations of the world become geographically separated from Albion, in whom they were one, and Jerusalem falls in ruins. Luvah is melted in the furnaces of affliction. The stars and skies are geometrically created. Urizen’s palace is built to house his emanation AHANIA, but cannot heal their separation. Urizen is troubled by visions of futurity. Meanwhile, Enitharmon continues to elude and mock Los. The conclusion of this Night is a second lament of Enion which now reaches Ahania.

P. 23.5 *Take thou possession\!* The weakened Albion relinquishes his power to Reason alone.

12–13 *The Human Brain… its golden porches* Albion’s brain and senses.

14 *No more Exulting* Urizen now has the power he wanted, but perceives it – too late – as a void. All his ‘creative’ deeds hereafter are compensatory.

P. 24.5 *the great Work master* A phrase used by Bacon *\(The Advancement of Learning*\) and Milton \(*Paradise Lost* 111.696\) for the god of Reason, creator of the stars. A commonplace of rationalist philosophy is that the orderly courses of the stars perfectly represent the Godhead of Reason. In the following account of Reason building the Mundane Shell, there are echoes of Plato’s *Timaeus*, Milton’s *Paradise Lost VIII*, and gnostic tradition, in which the demiurge who creates this inferior material world is identified, as here, with the Jehovah of the Hebrews.

P. 25 The symbolism of this page is that developed in *f.* The basic ideas are as follows: Mankind’s rule by Reason is a ‘petrifying’ of the human imagination. Hence ‘Albion’ as a geographical location suffers, and is separated from the ‘Nations of the Earth’ which in Eternity were one with him. *Reuben* and *Levi* \(1. 21\), two sons of the Patriarch Jacob, represent the natural man and priestcraft in this world. In Eternity they are Albion’s sons \(and Albion and Jacob are one\). Now they become remote from him. *The Daughters of Albion* here listed \(11. 29–30\) are enemies of Jerusalem – his true Liberty – and Jerusalem goes into Babylonian captivity. *Nimrod* \(1. 32\) is the first hunter of men, and Mankind’s first king. The *druid stones* are sacrificial.

40 *Luvah was cast into the Furnaces of affliction* Reason casts Passion into Hell. In Isaiah 48:10 ‘the furnace of Affliction’ is God’s instrument for refining transgressing Israel. This episode also appears in *f* 7.30–37.

41 *Vala fed* Here and hereafter, Vala is Nature. She feeds the fires whereby Passion suffers.

P. 26.4 *Hear ye the voice of Luvah* The lament of Passion when repressed by Reason. Luvah’s perceptions are in part reliable, in part distorted by his sufferings.

P. 27.9–10 *Lamb/Of God clothed in Luvahs garments* Christ shall experience the ‘Passion’ and become the dying God of which Luvah is here the archetype.

19 *Urizen… thy stern ambition* Luvah recognizes Urizen’s error, but not his own.

P.28.11–21 A parenthetical passage. Individual human beings retain the imagination to be appalled at the sufferings imposed by Urizen. But the rest, closed off from brotherhood, occupy themselves domestically \(self-contained family life is selfishness\) or deny vision and instead engage in pursuit of rational but barren Science or Commerce.

25 *Then siezd the Lions of Urizen their work* Urizen’s creation of the Mundane Shell continues: Luvah’s molten substance becomes stars; the golden looms weave the atmosphere; nets trap souls into material forms. A heavenly palace of Reason \(the Zodiac\) is built with Vala’s ashes and slave labour.

32 *the strong scales* The constellation Libra.

P. 29.3 *Caverns*… *Looms* The loom within a cave is a neo-Platonic symbol of Generation.

4 *First spun, then wove the Atmospheres* From *Paradise Lost* VII.241: ‘between spun out the Air’.

P. 30.8 *the Architect divine* A common eighteenth-century Deist epithet for God.

10 *Quadrangular the building rose the heaven squared by a line* This is a palace or temple of Reason; the line is the horizon. Compare ‘Behold, the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded’ \(1 Kings 8:27\).

15 *Twelve halls… twelve sons* The twelve signs of the zodiac form the Palace of Reason.

17 *three daughters* These resemble the Fates. They reappear in Nights VI, VII and IX.

23 *His Shadowy Feminine Semblance* Urizen’s emanation, Ahania – his Idealism, now separate from him.

P. 31.9–10 *I see not Luvah… pillars of fire* God’s glory took the form of a pillar of fire and a pillar of smoke to guide the Israelites through the wilderness.

P. 32.14 The Saviour takes on the body of Luvah.

P. 33.6 *the World of Tharmas* Beyond Reason’s constructed realm is Chaos, here identified with the ‘sea’ of incoherence into which Tharmas collapsed in Night 1.5.13. This follows Milton’s cosmology in *Paradise Lost* 11.895ff., and VII.212, where Chaos is seen outside the gates of Heaven, ‘Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wild’.

16 *a golden chain* From *Paradise Lost* 11.1052, where it sustains this ‘pendant world’. Urizen’s chain both sustains and imprisons Man.

P. 34.5 *Urizen… envied* Urizen’s rational but rigid heaven, now complete, brings him not joy but anxiety. He *envies* the greater flexibility of Los and Enitharmon.

9–10 *For Los* & *Enitharmon… Contracting or expanding* The ability to contract or expand the senses voluntarily, perceiving with a free imagination, is a divine attribute in Blake. Hence Los and Enitharmon have not fallen so far as the rigid Urizen, the passive Luvah or the chaotic Tharmas.

16–47 Torments of love and jealousy between Los and Enitharmon, as she frustrates his desires and is jealously possessive. The relationship here is sexual, but is also that of the Muse to her Poet: she will not obey him, yet she will not allow him any other mistress.

24–30 *If the God enrapturd… the bright God* Urizen here seen as Apollo. Inspiration, which should properly give itself to the Prophet, surrenders instead to Reason.

40 *the flocks of Tharmas* In Eden Tharmas is a shepherd.

57 *But thus she sang* Enitharmon’s song of female will triumphant; see her two comparable songs in *Europe* Pls. 6–8, 13–14, pp. 229, 233–6 above.

62 *nine*…*spheres of harmony* The harmony of the spheres \(sun, moon and seven known planets\) is a symbol of cosmic order from Pythagoras and Plato to Dante and Milton; but here it is under female control.

78–80 *Arise… holy* These lines quote Oothoon in *VDA*, 8.9–10. But where Oothoon’s motive was generosity, Enitharmon’s is power.

93 *Rapturous delusive trance* Enitharmon enraptures and deludes herself as well as Los.

98 *Vortex* A Cartesian term \(see *M* 15.21, n., p. 972 below\) which B. adapts to mean a system of thinking or feeling which attracts other things into itself. By driving Ahania into Enion’s vortex of sorrow, Los will divide her from Urizen. This occurs, with disastrous effects for Urizen’s rational ‘heaven’ – which cannot allow for sorrow – in Night 111.

P. 35.3–4 Taken from *VDA* 5.8–9, p. 202 above.

9 *My heavens are brass my earth is iron* From Deuteronomy 28:23: ‘thy heaven… shall be brass, and the earth… shall be iron’.

11 *What is the price of Experience* From Job 28:12–13: ‘Where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding? Man knoweth not the price thereof.’

P. 36.4 Taken from *BU* 25.1–2, p. 256 above.

13 *it is not so with me\!* From the cry in Job 9:34–5: ‘Let him take his rod away… Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.’

NIGHT THE THIRD

The Flood.

Urizen enthroned is rebuked by Ahania \(his idealism\). Unable to suffer this, he casts her out – and inadvertently produces a cataclysm which destroys the Circle of Destiny and unlooses the Flood of Tharmas hitherto \(since Night 1\) contained by it. In this cataclysm, Urizen himself falls with all his hosts, and is dashed to pieces.

P. 38.2 Los \(the Prophet\) was born from Tharmas \(Ocean\) in Night 1. Reason sees this and fears to yield his tyranny – like Pharaoh in Exodus 1, Herod in Matthew 2 and Zeus in the myth of Prometheus.

8–10 *Vala… Luvah* Urizen predicts the descent to birth in the fallen world of LUVAH and VALA as the lower forms ORC and the SHADOWY FEMALE. Orc’s birth occurs in Night v, the Shadowy Female’s in Night VIII.

P. 39.4 *Why didst thou listen… Luvah* Ahania’s version of the Fall begins here. It is accurate, except that it places entire blame on Passion, seeing Reason as merely passive. The account in Night 1 \(Pp. 21–2\) blames both, and Urizen’s self-condemning soliloquy in Night V \(Pp. 64–5\) will show that he too knows better.

8 *the wine presses of Luvah* Love and War.

10 *They* Urizen’s horses, now disobedient and perverse.

12 *but O how unlike* From *Paradise Lost* 1.84: ‘But O how fallen\! how changed.’

15 *The vision of Ahania* In Ahania’s vision, Albion – being intellectually asleep – worships his own shadow as a god, is smitten with boils by Luvah, then rejects Luvah. This follows the Job story backwards; for Job is initially virtuous \(B. would interpret this as a rejection of Luvah–Passion\), then is smitten, and concludes by worshipping. The episode recurs in *f* 43.33–82.

P. 41.16 ‘Satan… smote Job with sore boils’ \(Job 2:7\), and B. here is identifying the biblical Satan with Luvah.

17 *the Fallen Man… presence* This is the rejection of Passion, or Desire, complained of in *MHH* Pl 5, p. 182 above.

P. 42.18–19 A pencil addition, possibly made only in connection with B.’s intended transfer of the passage to *f* where it fits better.

*we alone are escaped* The messengers of disaster to Job each say ‘I only am escaped alone to tell thee.’

22 *Do I not stretch the heavens* God ‘alone spreadeth out the Heavens’, Job 9:8.

P. 43.14 *A cavern shaggd with horrid shades* ‘By grots and caverns shagg’d with horrid shades,’ Milton, *Comus* 429.

27 *The bounds of Destiny were broken* Tharmas set the Circle of Destiny in motion in Night 1. Its destruction wrecks Urizen’s world, and unlooses the Flood. This is B.’s version of Genesis 7. Tharmas–Chaos–Flood emerges, struggles to assume Man’s image, but remains a watery incoherence.



NIGHT THE FOURTH

The post-deluvian world; the binding of Urizen.

This Night opens with Tharmas–Chaos–Flood triumphant yet despairing. He commands Los to rebuild the ruined world, and when Los defies him, he rips Los and Enitharmon apart. At this, the crippled Spectre of Urthona \(Urthona was the unfallen Los\) appears, and gives his version of the Fall. Tharmas confides in the spectre, and forces Los to rebuild the ruined furnaces of Urizen. Los does so, then proceeds to the ‘binding of Urizen’ into a solid bodily form – of which the miserably limited anatomy is our own – in seven ages of woe.

At this low point in the action, B. adds a passage of specifically Christian import, based on the story of Lazarus. The Daughters of Beulah worship the Saviour while Albion’s corpse becomes like a polypus beaten by the sea of time and space. The Saviour promises regeneration and finds the lower limits of Opacity and Contraction in Albion. Following this interpolation, Los, terrified by the results of his labours, ‘becomes what he beholds’ – that is, his body too becomes solid.

P. 48.3–4 *But thou My Son… Rebuild this Universe* Tharmas gives Los the task of reconstruction.

12 Los becomes God’s voice to the sea in Job 38:11: ‘Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.’

21 *Doubting stood Tharmas* The pun on ‘doubting Thomas’ reflects Tharmas’s condition as the physical ‘sea’ of perpetual flux and destructiveness. The Apostle Thomas could not believe in the risen Christ until he had touched him physically.

P. 49.8 *griding* Piercing, wounding, cutting painfully; from Milton’s ‘griding sword’ \(*Paradise Lost* VI.329\).

11 *the Dark Spectre* Urthona has now divided into Los, Enitharmon and the Spectre of Urthona. Unlike Los, the Spectre of Urthona remembers the goodness of life in Eternity, and wills to restore it.

P. 50.1 *I well remember* The Spectre of Urthona recounts his own fall into division.

10–17 A similar version of the birth of Enitharmon is in *BU* 18, p. 252 above.

31 *O I could tell thee tales* From *Hamlet* 1.v.15–16: ‘I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word/Would harrow up thy soul.’

P. 51.2–3 *this Son/Of Enion* Los must now ‘bind the fallen King’ Urizen. The Eternal Prophet’s task is to embody, and thus at once define and limit, in artistic form, fallen Reason.

7 *the terror… drave… the tide* The Spectre parts the waves to permit Enitharmon’s return, as an engraver digs a channel in metal.

P. 52.2 From Deuteronomy 30:19: ‘I have set before you life and death… therefore choose life.’

P. 52.28-P. 53.3 *the thundering/Hammer… pulsative furor* Los’s hammer, by its regular beat, produces \(1\) periodic clock time; \(2\) the metre of poetry.

24 *he became what he beheld* Repeated 55.22. According to B., all beings are defined by their perceptions. Thus the Prophet embodies his age, and is also limited by it. Los, binding Urizen, also binds himself.

P. 54.1-P. 55.9 The binding of Urizen, which parodies the seven days of creation, is also told in *BU* IV \[b\], p. 247 above.

P. 55.10-P. 56.27 The Council of God passage is a later interpolation in the text.

P. 55.14 *a Double female form* Mary and Martha in the story of Lazarus.

P. 56.1–3 *if thou hadst been here… thee* From the story of Lazarus, John 11:21–2, ‘Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.’ Albion, like Lazarus, will be raised from death. This is repeated in *f* 50.11.

8–10 *In which… we shall consume* Repeated in *M* 30.25–7.

8 *hidden under the Shadow of wings* From Psalm 17:8, ‘hide me under the shadow of thy wings’.

18 *If ye will Believe your Brother shall rise again* From the words of Jesus to Martha, John 11:23–6, ‘Thy brother shall rise again… he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live… Believest thou this?’

19 *the Limit of Opacity… Satan* Opacity is impermeable to the Divine Light. SATAN represents the greatest possible ‘hardness’ of heart and mind which can still sustain life.

21 *the Limit of Contraction… Adam* Contraction is shrinkage from infinity. ADAM represents the greatest possible ‘smallness’ or ‘narrowness’ of heart and mind which can still sustain life. Humankind as we know it is as ‘hard’ and ‘narrow’ as it can be without lapsing into an inorganic state. SATAN and ADAM in this context are labels, not characters.

23 *the Starry Wheels* The orbiting stars of Urizen’s purely rational universe.

25 *the Seventh furnace* Los has reconstructed Urizen’s ruined furnaces. The seventh and last corresponds to the Seventh Eye of God, Jesus; Divine Mercy points to salvation. Compare J 48.45.

P. 55 \(second pt.\) The exhaustion of Los repeats *BU* v, p. 250 above.



NIGHT THE FIFTH

Rebellion is generated: The birth of Orc.

Los and Enitharmon stiffen into huge but rock-like forms, as the fires of creation fade. Enitharmon gives birth to ORC \(the ‘terrible child’ who represents Rebellious Energy and is the fallen form of Luvah\). When Orc reaches the age of fourteen, Los binds him to a mountain with the chain of Jealousy. Despite his chains Orc is fiery and spiritually free. Los and Enitharmon repent their deed but find they cannot undo it, and Enitharmon’s previously closed heart begins to break. Finally, Urizen hears Orc struggling and resolves to explore his dens in hope of finding him.

P. 57.1 *Infected Mad he dancd* The dance of Los suggests that of a shaman, who in primitive societies is at once priest, prophet and healer, curing diseases by absorbing them into himself during fits of hallucinatory ecstatic dancing.

P. 58.3–4 *But the soft pipe… silver voices* Orc is born like Christ, in mid-winter, attended by music. Details all parallel Milton’s ‘Nativity Ode’; but the event is demonic, not divine.

8 *Earth convulsed with rending pangs* In *Paradise Lost* IX.1000–1001, ‘Earth trembl’d from her entrails, as again/In pangs’ at the advent of original sin.

P. 58.22-P. 59.20 The Demons of the Deep sing a ‘carol’ for Orc’s birth. In 58.23–5 they recapitulate Night 1.22.12–15. Then, since Luvah is born in the form of Orc, they call for the birth of Vala, his counterpart. This occurs in Night VII \[a\].

P. 59.11–16 *Torn by black storms*… *flames of fire* Repeated with alterations in J 40.39–42.

P. 60.3–4 *He builded Golgonooza*… *Luban* The image of the City of Prophecy, and its Gate looking out on darkness, becomes a major symbol in *Jerusalem.*

6 *fourteen summers* & *winters* The puberty of Orc precipitates an Oedipal triangle. Rebellion challenges his father but is repressed by a Chain of Jealousy. The episode is repeated with alterations from *BU* 20.9–24.

26–8 *the iron mountains top*… *naild him down* The infant Oedipus was left by his parents to die with pierced ankles on a mountain.

P. 61.2 *the Demons rage flamd* Orc’s element is fire.

10 *Storgous Appetite* From Gr. *storge*, instinctive parental affection for the young.

11 *His limbs bound down mock* Youthful rebellion is spiritually free and alive, despite repression.

18–20 *His eyes… Vala* Orc sees into the secrets of Nature. \(Note that the objects of Orc’s expansive perceptions, as well as the images of his own being, are all from Nature; such is his kingdom in this world.\)

P. 62.22–P. 63.3 *Lo the young limbs… one with him* Repression begins as an external force, but soon is internalized by the individual. Then it is too late to undo.

P. 62.30 Neither instinct nor passion can defeat repression. \(Note the echo of Humpty-Dumpty.\)

P. 63.11 *Enitharmon on the road of Dranthon* Enitharmon’s conversion begins. The term ‘road of Dranthon’ is not developed elsewhere, but in Acts 9 the future Apostle Paul is converted by a vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus.

11–12 *the inmost gate*… *burst open* Enitharmon’s previously ‘hard’ heart begins to break. Suffering begins the process of redemption, and she sees true visions.

23 Urizen lies enclosed in the world constructed by Urthona–Los \(in Night IV\) after his own world fell in ruins when he rejected Ahania \(idealism\) in Night 111. The distant struggles of incipient Rebellion awaken him to memory of his former eternal state and realization of his error.

26 *the sons of wisdom* Urizen’s sons in Eternity.

27 *the Virgins sang* The Muses sang \(Urizen as ‘Prince of Light’ in Eternity was identical with Apollo, parent of the Muses\).

P. 64.3 *Nine virgins* The nine Muses.

14 *O I refusd the Lord of day* Intellect \(day\) refused to serve his Lord, the Divine Vision who created him.

21–2 *the mild & holy voice… shine* The voice of the Divine Vision saying ‘Let there be light’ \(Genesis 1:3\).

24 *guide my Son* Intellect was supposed to have been the guide of Mankind, Albion.

26 *the night of councils dark* The negotiations between the Prince of Light and Luvah, each desiring dominance over Man. Urizen’s version of the Fall corresponds with that told by the Ambassadors in Night 1, P. 21.

27 *The stars… their spears* From ‘When the stars threw down their spears’, ‘The Tyger’, *SE*, p. 125 above.

29–31 *Luvah… the golden cup* Luvah was the vintner of Eternity, as Urizen was the ploughman with his horses. Urizen made the bread of communion, Luvah the wine; they should not have changed places \(see 65.5–7\)

P. 65.12 The closed intellect rejects divine Love, thus forcing it into a hellish form. Luvah has been born as Orc – a demon – because Love’s only outlet now is Rebellion.



NIGHT THE SIXTH

Urizen explores his dens.

Urizen sets out in search of Orc. He is now no longer the cosmic Creator, but a fallen mind wandering through its own ruins. He begins badly, by cursing his daughters at the Water of Life. He travels through the realm of Tharmas \(west\), sees but cannot heal the sufferings of men in his own realm \(south\) who have inherited his curse, and falls into the void of Luvah’s world \(east\). Here he undergoes repeated falls, deaths and resurrections, which represent successive civilizations in history, but his intellectual confusion persists. Desperate to gain control, he creates fixed ‘Sciences’ and a Web of Religion. Still sorrowing, he approaches the world of Urthona-Los \(north\) and the chained Orc.

P. 67.1 *Urizen… explord his dens* The journey of Urizen parallels that of Satan through Hell and Chaos \(*Paradise Lost* 11\).

1–3 *his Spear… helmet* Weapon and armour indicate that Urizen’s repentance \(close of Night v\) was incomplete.

5 *three terrific women* Urizen’s daughters may recall the Fates, the Furies, the Three Witches in *Macbeth* or – since he soon curses them – the three daughters of King Lear. They rain, gather into a spring, and divide into rivers, the water of life.

P. 68.3 *dry the rocky strand* Reason dries up the waters of life.

16–19 *I will reverse… stinking corruptibility* Thus God curses the daughters of Zion \(Isaiah 3:24\): ‘Instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness… and burning instead of beauty.’

P. 70.21–48 *The horrid shapes… ruind world* The sufferings inflicted in Urizen’s world include torture, slavery, industrial labour, prisons, servitude of the weak to the strong, and the dominance of materialism – iron, brass and gold.

P. 71.18–19 *he stood a while… voyage* Thus Satan in *Paradise Lost* 11.918–19 ‘Stood on the brink of Hell and look’d a while/Pondering his Voyage’.

23 *bottomless vacuity* Thus Satan in *Paradise Lost* 11.932 falls through ‘vast vacuity’.

32–4 *flight*…. *another resurrection* Urizen’s voyage now spans the history of mankind. His repeated births, growths and deaths are the rises and falls of civilizations.

35 *But still his books he bore* Urizen’s scriptures are the dogmas of successive civilizations. They remain unconsumed – though perpetually augmented with scholarly commentary – throughout history. Although the ‘death clothes’ of particular dogmas may rot as a particular civilization declines, dogmatism in itself persists.

P. 73.14 *Here will I fix my foot* Urizen resolves to systematize the intellectual confusion of his kingdom. The compass image is a dominant emblem of the god of Reason, and one which B. dwelt on persistently, as in the frontispiece to *Europe* and the Notebook epigram ‘To God’ \(p. 628\): ‘If you have formd a Circle to go into/Go into it yourself & see how you would do.’

15 *Mountains of Brass promise much riches* Mammon argues similarly to his fellow demons in *Paradise Lost* 11.270–73.

21 *the Sciences were fixd* An ‘Age of Enlightenment’ tyrannizes over mankind more strictly than any previous age. Possibly B. is thinking of ‘classical’ Graeco-Roman culture, which he despised.

31 *a dire Web* See the ‘Net of Religion’, *BU* VIII, p. 257 above. Urizen’s systematic rationalism connects one ‘vortex’ of intellect to another, and further imprisons mankind.

P. 74.8 *rending the web* Mankind’s spiritual agony causes rips in the web of religion, but does not destroy it.

12 *Four Caverns* The four Zoas now have four mental prisons, and their regions \(except for Urthona’s\) are dislocated from those of Eternity. In ll. 14–19, Orc is fire, Urizen is air, Urthona is earth, and Tharmas is water, assailing the rest.

P. 75.6 *the Shadow of Urthona* Urizen meets the Spectre of Urthona, last seen in Night IV. Pp. 49–51. He is now a crude warrior-figure combining attributes of Orion, Hercules and the Norse god Thor.

19–21 *Four winged heralds*… *fifty two armies* The four seasons, and the weeks in a year, are the troops of Urthona-Los, who is Time. The passage is taken with alterations from *America*, cancelled Pl. \[c\] 14–17

25–6 *Urizen… Retiring* Time forces Reason into temporary retreat. Compare the confrontation between Satan and the Angel Gabriel with his troops in *Paradise Lost* IV.877–1015.

NIGHT THE SEVENTH \[a\]

The lapse of Orc; birth of the Shadowy Female; reunion of Los and Enitharmon.

This night divides into three episodes, of which the first two trace the consolidation of Urizen’s power and the ‘horrible’ birth of a goddess of Nature. But in the third, out of the depths of grief and despair, the positive activity of prophetic art at last gets under way. The episodes are as follows:

1. Reason \(Urizen\) at last encounters Revolution \(Orc\), with envious snowstorms trying to cool Orc’s fires. Urizen now has degenerated to simple tyranny. He is the God–priest–king–politician–intellectual authoritarian, desperately resisting change. The Tree of Mystery shoots up around him. Urizen pretends to pity Orc, is confused by his incomprehensible ‘joy’. Orc scorns his pity and mocks his rigidity. Urizen compels his daughters to knead the bread of sorrow as a demonstration of his power, and reads a cynical sermon on how to control the poor. His hypocrisy weakens Orc, who lapses into a worm or serpent, and is made by Urizen to climb the Tree of Mystery.

2. The Los-Enitharmon story resumes \(81.7\). At the close of Night v they had failed to free Orc, and ‘all their after life was lamentation’. Now Enitharmon’s Shadow \(her life force, ‘spirit’ or vitality\) leaves her each night to mourn for Orc beneath the Tree of Mystery, and Los is left with an unresponsive wife. Urthona’s Spectre \(remnant of unfallen Los\) courts and embraces Enitharmon’s Shadow, and a ‘wonder horrible’ is born. This is the earthly form of Vala, later called the SHADOWY FEMALE. She is the seductive goddess of Nature.

3. At this point \(85.13\) Enitharmon’s heart finally breaks completely, while mankind declines, lured by Nature. Los reunites with the Spectre, who promises another better world within, and they work together to build GOLGONOOZA \(City of Art\). Los eats the fruit of the Tree of Mystery, but resists self-destruction and begins to create living works of Art, with Enitharmon’s help.

P. 77.5 *But Urizen… Caves of Orc* Reason encounters Revolution, aflame. In the all-consuming fires of revolutionary passion, reason’s horses of instruction and lions and tygers of wrath can only suffer. The Scales of Justice are melted by the oil-burning Lamps of revolutionary mercy. The plough and harrow of Eternity become mired in bloody fields, among scenes of battle instead of agriculture.

18 *Urizen approachd not near* Reason dares not deal directly with Revolution.

P. 78.2 *His book of iron* Urizen’s code of war.

5–6 *the root of Mystery… Branches* The Tree of Mystery grows from Reason’s hostility to Revolution. Reason – trying to maintain the *status quo*, or to damp the fires of Rebellion – is forced to take the position that sacred truths must remain incomprehensible to men.

9–12 These lines are repeated from *The Book of Ahania*, 3.68–74.

17–32 *Image of dread… Yet thou dost laugh* Reason cannot understand the terrible joy of Revolution, which persists despite Promethean tortures.

30 *Pity for thee movd me* Urizen is hypocritical or self-deluding. He sought Orc out of nervous dread about the future \(III.38.10–11, v.65.10–12\).

P. 79.3 *Thou art not chaind Why shouldst thou sit* Revolution, in turn, cannot understand the rigidity of Reason.

23 *bread of Sorrow* From God’s punishment of Adam \(Genesis 3:17–19\): ‘cursed is the ground for thy sake: in sorrow shalt thou eat of it… In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.’

25 *Eleth, Uveth, Ona* Urizen’s daughters.

P. 80.1 *Urizen Read in his book of brass in sounding tones* Urizenic economics, in tones of ‘sounding brass’ that ‘have not charity’ \(I Corinthians 13:1\).

9–14 *Compell the poor… with temper* William Pitt as Lord of the Treasury in the 1800 Bread Bill debate countered complaints of scarcity and proposals for lowered prices with an insistence that the poor should be encouraged ‘to diminish the consumption’ and that Parliament should ‘act with proper temper, firmness and sobriety’ \(see Erdman, 341–2\). The principles of 11. 9, 16 recur in *f* 44.30–31.

12–14 *And when his children*… *arts* The economist Malthus in a 1798 *Essay on Population* pointed out that war, famine and pestilence were effective checks on population growth.

28–9 *thou beginnest to weaken/My divided spirit* Revolution begins to degenera te into a passive worm \(such as English radicalism\) or a powerful but hypocritical serpent \(such as French radicalism subverted by Napoleon\). See Erdman, 348.

31 *Am I a worm* ‘But I am a worm, and no man’ \(Psalm 22:6\).

P. 81.3–5 *Orc/In Serpent form*… *submission* Revolution has now hardened and lost its true nature. Thus it is crucified, and thus ends a historical cycle. The images are from John 3:14: ‘And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up,’ and John 12:32: ‘And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.’

7 The Los-Enitharmon story resumes.

P. 82.23 The following episode takes place ‘beneath the Tree of Mystery’. The Spectre woos and seduces the Shadow, in desperate hopes of reunion and return to Eternity. But in their conscious life above the Tree, Los and Enitharmon are unaware that this is happening.

P. 83.4–34 *I will tell… my fierce boy* The Shadow of Enitharmon gives her feminine version of the Fall. She blames everything on Vala, and wants Vala punished, subjected to her son Orc. \(She does not know that Orc is the fallen Luvah and thus the proper mate for Vala.\)

P. 84.5–35 *Where thou & I… unite again in bliss* The Spectre of Urthona recalls Eternity and the Fall, and promises \(I\) to cause Vala’s birth and subjection to Orc in this world; \(2\) to destroy Los \(his own fallen form\); and \(3\) to reunite with Enitharmon’s shadow.

P. 85.6–7 *Enitharmons shadow*… *a wonder horrible* Vala is born on earth as the Shadowy Female: seductive Material Nature. The results are terrible \(War in Night VIII\) yet necessary to the process of Man’s salvation.

11–12 *then she ran*… *Elements* Enitharmon’s subdued desire, having given birth to the Shadowy Female, returns to Enitharmon’s ‘upper’ or conscious life, producing havoc.

13 *She burst… heart* Suffering finally completes Enitharmon’s heartbreak; hereafter she has the ‘broken and contrite heart’ required for salvation.

18–21 *Till many… lovely shadow* In neo-Platonic doctrine, immortal souls are lured to descend into fleshly bodies by the attraction of Nature, who is commonly described as a ‘shadow’ of reality. Here, many in the fallen world sink lower still, seduced by Nature. Lacking ideals \(feminine counterparts\), they are wholly destructive.

22 Nature becomes the guardian of Revolution. See Orc and the Shadowy Female in the preludium to *America*, pp. 208–10 above; and the Babe and Woman Old in ‘The Mental Traveller’, Pickering MS., p. 499 below.

P. 87.9 *new heavens* & *a new Earth* From Revelation 21:1–2: ‘And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away… And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven.’

11–13 *A Threefold Atmosphere… Translucence* The sky of the City of Art extends upward into the ‘threefold’ realm of Beulah. But the City’s lower limit is that of Opacity and Contraction \(see IV.56.19–21, n.\). In other words, the range of Art is from divine dreams at its best to malice and stupidity at its worst.

16 Enitharmon confesses her sin \(made known to her by eating the fruit of the Tree of Mystery\) and despairs. She hopes Los, likewise eating the fruit, will resist the effects of guilt. But Los despairs. The idea is from Romans 7:7–9: ‘I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet… For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.’

29 *six thousand Years* The fruit of the tree having been eaten, as in Genesis, recorded human history begins. At the end of this period apocalypse and redemption will occur.

P. 90.8–9 *Stern desire… semblances* Los announces the will to create works of Art in which ‘the dead’ of this world will find their true lives.

27–8 *the loud roaring flames/He vanquishd* Los uses the hitherto barren flames of Reason in conflict, and Revolution enchained, for his Art.

36–7 *And first he drew… tincturd it* Catherine Blake commonly coloured B.’s engravings for him.

45 *Rintrah*… *Palamabron* Sons of Los representing Wrath and Pity \(or sublime and pathetic art\).

57 *soft silken veils* Bodies covering the spirit.

58 *his*… *spirit drew Urizen* Los recreates even Urizen as a form of Art, and thus is able to love him.

63 Thiriel, Urizen’s oldest son, is the element of air \(see *BU VIII*\). Reason enters sublime art; his son enters pathetic art.



NIGHT THE SEVENTH \[b\]

Empire, War and the dominion of Nature.

A separate fragment, partially tallying with the situation at the close of VII \[a\], although \[a\] was written later than \[b\] and may have been intended to replace it. Pp. 95.15–98 follow 91.1–95.14 in the MS., but B. indicates that the two halves of this Night should be transposed. In the transposed reading, events are as follows:

Urizen develops an empire, builds a temple and prepares for conquest. Los opposes him. Tharmas allies himself with Los. Finally Orc breaks loose and rends the Shadowy Female. Thus all the Zoas have become involved in destruction. The elemental gods celebrate this with a cruel war song. Orc has now become fully serpentine – Revolution subverted – and the Shadowy Female triumphs in the war. She tries, unsuccessfully, to make Tharmas her ally. She remains, despite her triumph, a ‘howling melancholy’. Amid the devastation, the Daughters of Beulah remember the divine promise of regeneration, even while men sink lower into a Satanic state.

P. 95.20 Urizen triumphs as God, ‘Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain’ \(Psalm 104:2\).

32–3 *Urizen*… *Builded a temple in the image of the human heart* Worship of the ‘selfish virtues of the natural heart’ is condemned in *f* 52.

P. 96.1–2 *And in the inner part*… *Secret place* B. here condemns the mysteries of priestcraft and ritual. The Tabernacle of the Temple, in Old Testament times, could be entered only by the High Priest. B. interprets this ‘secret place’ sexually, claiming that the priests pretend to worship purity and repress sexuality, yet practise ‘secret lust’.

9 *they took the Sun*… *Los* The light of Prophecy is exploited to justify the temple of Empire.

18 *The day*… *religion* War and Religion mutually support each other.

19 *Urizen namd it Pande* Pandemonium, the demonic abode of *Paradise Lost* 1.756.

20 *Los reard his mighty stature* Prophecy prepares to oppose Empire. Los here is a primitive bard \(of epic poetry or heroic ballad\) who ‘follows War’ \(97.21\).

P. 98.22 *The Prester Serpent* The legendary medieval priest-tyrant Prester John. His cowl is a cobra’s head.

P. 91.2 *The nameless shadowy Vortex* This is the SHADOWY FEMALE, fallen form of VALA, the Nature-goddess born in Night VII \[a\] 85 and set to guard Orc.

17–19 *The hairy shoulders*… *nameless shadow* Revolution at last breaks loose, and ravishes Nature.

P. 91.21–P. 93.19 The long war song of the ‘elemental Gods’ concerns the conflict between Urthona–Los of the north, and Urizen \(‘the rising… King’, 91.30\) of the south. It modulates between rhapsodic celebration and prophetic narrative. Comparable songs by ‘Demons of the Deep’ are in Night I.14.7ff., Night v.s8.22ff. Most of this song is repeated in *f* 65.6–55.

P. 92.3 *darts of wintry hail*… *black bow* Artillery, cannon.

9–13 *clarions of Victory*… *death of Luvah* The Druid practice, reported by Caesar, of sacrificing prisoners before a battle to ensure victory, is identified with the Crucifixion \(which will occur in Night viii.P.106\). We are not told which side wins this battle, for it does not matter. The victim is always Love.

17–33 *Then left the Sons*… *rules of life* An interruption in the song. Blake associates warfare, industrialism and rationalism as mutually necessary parts of one system.

34 In the following passage, Vala is the seductress, at once Nature-goddess and *femme fatale*, whose worship is responsible for War.

P. 93.6 *Remembers all thy feigned terrors* By feigning chastity the seductress encourages her lovers to be warriors. War is the sublimation of thwarted sexual energy.

33 *The Shadowy Female* Vala has seduced both Orc and Urizen. She now turns to Tharmas, appealing to his pity. Though triumphant in the war, she is a ‘howling melancholy’ \(94.48\) because she cannot reunite with Luvah.

P. 94.16–17 *Enitharmon* & *Ahania*… *Enion/Hid him* A lie. Vala wants Tharmas to pity her, not blame her for Man’s Fall.

P. 95.6 *If ye will believe*… *rise again* Repeats the promise given at the close of Night iv \(56.18\).

II Repeats the decline of Night VII \[a\] \(85.18\).



NIGHT THE EIGHTH

The dark before the dawn; Mankind submerged in War; Incarnation and Crucifixion of the Lamb.

The Council of God meets to create fallen Man on the limit of contraction. Man begins to wake. The activity of Prophecy goes on, as Los-Enitharmon continue receiving spectres of the dead from Urizen’s wars through Enitharmon’s broken heart gate, and Enitharmon makes looms to weave them bodies. The Divine Countenance shines on them. Urizen is perplexed by this sight \(the Lamb of God in Luvah’s robes\), for he thought he had conquered Luvah \(Passion\) by subverting Orc \(Revolution\). Meanwhile Orc in serpent form keeps eating the bread of sorrow, which breaks out in jewels all over him.

Urizen at last makes war directly against Los \(P. 100, second portion\). His artillery is described. The battle takes the form of a HERMAPHRODITE called SATAN. Los and Enitharmon respond not by violence but by inspired contemplation, their prophecies receiving and humanizing the victims of war. Urizen augments his armaments, makes martial music to pervert souls, propagates his books. But Vala, begging him to return Luvah, soaks with her tears the Web of Religion until it falls, altering all the vortexes of knowledge and entangling Urizen himself. Meanwhile, Enitharmon’s opus, collectively, is JERUSALEM, the EMANATION of ALBION. The Lamb of God emerges from Jerusalem \(P. 104\). SATAN emerges from the hermaphroditic war. They meet. The synagogue of Satan, concealing the Great Whore RAHAB and the cruel TIRZAH within, judges and crucifies the Lamb. Los tries to teach Rahab, but she turns away. Urizen is transformed into a dragon – his final degeneration.

The close of the book \(P. 108\) begins with a hopeful dialogue between Ahania and Enion, who anticipates regeneration, while the body of the Lamb is placed in a sepulchre. P. III gives the history of Rahab in the Christian era, down to the eighteenth century.

P. 99.2 *Gilead & Hermon* Mountains on the frontiers of the Holy Land.

16–17 *Man began/To wake*… *sneezed seven times* The prophet Elisha revived a dead child by lying upon his body, ‘and the child sneezed seven times and… opened his eyes’ \(2 Kings 4:35\).

P. 101.8 *a Serpent*… *among the Constellations* Serpens is the constellation adjoining Ophiocus.

17–18 *Orc devourd the food… gems* & *gold* Degenerated Revolution feeds on the Bread of Sorrow – made from the fruit of the Tree of Mystery – and becomes encrusted with emblems of wealth. Thus Revolution turns into Reaction.

20–21 *the dark shadowy female*… *food* See *America*, preludium.

P. 100.34 *Synagogue of Satan* A term in Revelation 3:9 denoting blasphemous religious hypocrisy.

*Sanhedrim* Jewish councils or courts; in the Gospels, they are opposed to Jesus.

P. 101.33–4 *Urizen beheld the battle*… *hermaphrodite* The hermaphrodite contains both sexes in contradiction without synthesis and is thus a Blakean symbol of monstrous absurdity. War is hermaphroditic because it is self-contradictory; note the idea that Reason never intends to produce contradiction, but always does.

P. 101.43–P. 102.11 *Feeling the hand of Los*… *beastial length* A description of the lives of soldiers. While inspired by heroic ideals \(works of Los\) they may be temporarily ‘human’. But they soon relapse to bestiality.

P. 102.15–16 *linked chains*… *boring screws* Chain-shot, and instruments for sinking enemy ships.

P. 102.26 *the Shadowy Female* The Shadowy Female is Vala, now not a *femme fatale* but a *dolorosa*: the beloved who craves her lover.

P. 103.3 *the murderer of my Luvah* Vala’s error: she does not see the Divine Vision except as her lover’s murderer.

18 *For he was source* Love was a reality; Theology is a mockery.

26 *the*… *Web of Religion*… *fell* Rational Religion – a flimsy web – cannot sustain the weight of Sorrow’s tears. It falls, and entangles even Reason in its collapse.

P. 104.1 *Jerusalem the holy* The ‘family’ \(103.37\) of lost souls given form by Enitharmon collectively becomes Jerusalem, Albion’s emanation and bride.

7 *put off the dark Satanic body* From Colossians 3:9–10, ‘ye have put off the old man… And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.’

P. 113 A ‘set piece’ on life, death and the resurrection is inserted here. The Sons of Eden sing of Los and Enitharmon creating life, then of Tirzah and Rahab, Satan and Beelzeboul creating death, and finally of the Lamb’s triumph over death.

1 *Looms*… *Forges* Painting and Poetry to create Man.

2 *Spindles*… *Mills* Fate and Logic to destroy Man.

4–5\] Deleted lines used in *M* 24.63–4.

16 Souls put on their bodies, at the brink of earthly life. *Arnon* A river at the border of the Holy Land.

35 *She smites with her knife of flint* The knife used for circumcision \(lit. ‘cutting-round’\) destroys the body of the Lamb. But the body is removed \(‘put off’\) like a husk, and the spirit remains.

39 *They anoint his feet* Mary does so for Jesus in John 12:3.

P. 104.17 From Revelation 22:20: ‘Surely I come quickly: Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.’

23–7 *Satan*… *A male*… *Yet hiding the shadowy female Vala* The apotheosis of Satan, concealing Vala \(Nature\) as his guiding power, immediately precedes the Nativity.

32 *the Lamb of God Descended* The Nativity takes place.

P. 105.5 *the Synagogue of Satan in dire Sanhedrim* The congregation of Hypocrisy \(Revelation 3:9\) in the court of the Commandments will condemn Jesus.

7 From Isaiah 53:12, fulfilled in Mark 15:28 and Luke 22:37.

11 *A False Feminine Counterpart* In the trial against Jesus, the guiding power is RAHAB, a ‘vegetated’ form of Vala. She is the final apotheosis of Nature which torments Spirit, and the Church of worldly corruption.

27 *Tirzah* See Dictionary of Proper Names.

31–54 *O thou poor human form*… *Vegetation* This song of female cruelty is repeated in *f* 67.44–68.9.

42–3 *Ephraim*… *Manasseh* Regions in the north of the Holy Land \(as are Shechem and Gilead, 1. 52\), of which Tirzah was a secessionist capital, competing with Jerusalem.

45–55 *Noah, Malah, Hoglah, Milcah, Tirzah* Daughters of Zelophe-had who successfully demanded female inheritance in the absence of sons \(Numbers 27:1–7\). B. makes them an example of cruel female will.

48 *Ebal* The site of a ritual curse laid on Israel \(Deuteronomy 27:13–26\).

49 *Lebanon* Famous for forests \(thus representing ‘error’\). *sinai* The site of the law.

56 *the twelve portions of Luvah* Implies the twelve tribes of Israel.

P. 106.26 *the Sepulcher which Los had hewn* Los fills the role of Joseph of Arimathea, who gave Jesus burial in his own tomb and who – according to legend – afterwards became the apostle of Britain.

P. 113.50–51 Los likewise announces himself in *M* 22.15–16.

P. 115 Catalogue of the children of Los and Enitharmon. The male and female lists both begin in myth and end in recorded history. Damon \(387–8\) considers this an intended catalogue of all human types through the ages, and interprets many of the names.

Male list: In the Bard’s Song of *M, Rintrah, Palambron, Theotormon, Bromion* are Los’s ‘good’ sons. *Antamon, Ozoth, Sotha* are in minor roles. *Satan* is Los’s bad son. *Har* and *Ijim* are ‘law’ and ‘superstition’ in *Tiriel*. *Adam* is the first ‘historic’ hero, followed by the twelve tribes of Israel, then *David* and *Solomon* as Israel’s great kings. *Paul, Constantine, Charlemaine, Luther* represent the Churches of the Christian era. Finally, *Milton* is the most modern embodiment of the spirit of Prophecy.

Female list: the first four are emanations of the first four males, and represent various aspects of female sexuality. The second four are mentioned in *BU* and *Europe* and represent the elements air, earth, fire, water. *Moab* and *Midian* were nations hostile to Israel. *Adah, Zillah, Naamah, Tamar* are biblical wives and sisters. *Rahab* and *Tirzah* are the temptresses and torturers of mankind. Finally, *Mary* perhaps pairs with *Milton* as the most recent female receptacle of the Holy Spirit.

12 *But Satan accusd Palamabron* This story, here only sketchily suggested, is told in full in the Bard’s song of *M* Pls. 3–13. The main point is that Satan as a child of Los precipitated a quarrel which ended in his exclusion from Los’s family, and that the sacrifice of Jesus is a final result.

42–50 *Lucifer*… *Jesus* The successive guardians of mankind are also named in *M* 13.17–27 \(see note\). They are the ‘eyes of God’ or ‘lamps of the Almighty’ given in Night 1.19.9–10. See SEVEN EYES OF GOD.

P. 106.29 *Urizen sitting in his web* The Web of Religion fell and entangled Urizen himself in 103.26.

36–42 *His eyes shot outwards*… *the Abyss* Attempting to embrace Nature, Urizen becomes a beast, falling prone like Satan in *Paradise Lost* x. 511–12. Reason has now collapsed to its opposite.

P. 107.21–31 *Then Tharmas & Urthona*… *strength* The stupefying poison of Nature affects Tharmas and Urthona-Los. But Tharmas and Urthona sacrifice themselves to strengthen Los.

P. 108.8 *And thus Ahania cries aloud* The lament of the fertile earth, now barren.

11–12 Taken in modified form from *VDA* 5.41–6.1.

21 A conflation of Romans 7:24: ‘O wretched man that I am\! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?’ and I Corinthians 15:53: ‘For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.’

P. 109.13 *Enion replies*… *Grave* Enion herself is ‘the grave’, now anticipating resurrection.

21 *Awake the bridegroom cometh* In the parable of the wise and foolish virgins, Matthew 25:6, the bridegroom is Christ.

32–3 *cast away/The former things* ‘There shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away’ \(Revelation 21:4\).

P.111.4 *John Saw these things Reveald* ‘John of Patmos’ is the author of Revelation. The references are to Revelation 6:9–11 \(the souls of the martyrs\) and Revelation 17:3–5 \(the triumph of the harlot\).

10–11 *She secretly left… Orc* B. outlines the history of Theology and the Church in the Christian era, alternating between legalism and radicalism.

11 *She hid him with the flax* The harlot Rahab in Joshua 2:6 protected two Jewish spies by hiding them in the flax on her roof.

20 *To burn Mystery* The old theology dies, but is renewed again in deism, the ‘rational’ religion of the eighteenth century.



NIGHT THE NINTH

The Last Judgement.

Los in final desperation tears down the sun and moon, and the fires of Orc begin to consume the whole world. The dead awake to judgement, and Tyranny is cut off.

Man awakes \(119.24\) and commands Urizen to resume his true form. Urizen weeping rejects ‘futurity’, accepts the present, gives up the effort to curb all the Zoas, and immediately rises into heaven as a radiant haloed youth. Ahania simultaneously rises, like a bubble – but bursts from excess of joy and is buried for the duration of winter. Man tells Urizen to plough and await the spring, and the remainder of Night IX follows a seasonal cycle.

122.26: In winter, the universe explodes, the dead are resurrected and oppressors are punished by their victims, as flames roar. Man gets up from his rock, walks, tries to meet the Lord in the flames, but is driven back. Urizen ploughs, sows, harrows, awaits the harvest. The continual flames make the seeds grow. Ahania \(spring\) returns. Man again tries to enter the flames, is again driven back.

P. 126: The advent of summer. As Orc is consumed in his own flames, Luvah and Vala appear, and enter a pastoral golden age. Tharmas and Enion are born as children in Vala’s garden. As autumn arrives \(P. 132\), Urizen reaps the last harvest. Tharmas and Enion reunite at a feast of the Eternals. Urizen threshes and winnows the nations: this is the end of Mystery and the liberation of slaves. Finally, Luvah presses the human grapes of the last vintage. Urthona \(137. 34\) rises and grinds the corn \(the nations\) in his mills. Tharmas sifts it, and the bread bakes in the last winter. Final chorale.

P. 117.8–11 *the Sun… the Moon… Sound of Loud Trumpet* ‘Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light… And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet’ \(Matthew 24:29–31\).

14–18 *Folding like scrolls… Kings are shaken* ‘And the heaven departed as a scroll… and every mountain and island were moved out of their places. And the Kings of the earth… hid themselves’ \(Revelation 6:14–15\).

16 ‘The earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook’ \(2 Samuel 22:8\).

P. 118.9 *Orc began to Consume… fire* Orc is consuming both ‘the whole creation’ and himself. The fires continue until P. 125.

P. 119.3–4 *twenty Seven/Folds M* and *f* develop the image of a MUNDANE SHELL of twenty-seven heavens \(successive Churches\) encrusted round the material earth.

15 *the Dragon form… stony form* Urizen was transformed to a prone dragon, while his human form petrified, in Night VIII.

32 ‘But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind’ \(Romans 7:23\). ‘From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?’ \(James 4:1\).

P. 119.33–P. 120.3 This passage, somewhat altered, appears in *f* 19.1–14.

P. 120.10 *Yet will I look… morning* ‘Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him’ \(Job 13:15\). ‘My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning’ \(Psalm 130:6\). Albion at last begins his renewal.

50 A ‘line of scarlet thread in the window’ \(Joshua 2:18\) was the sign to save Rahab and her family.

P. 121.26 Urizen at last sees the light. The Reason which fears Passion and Sensation is only Doubt. When it relinquishes this fear it becomes Faith.

35–7 *Ahania rose in joy… She fell down dead* Idealism cannot be sustained by Faith alone. The full restoration of Ahania will depend on Works. Ahania in VIII. Pp. 108–9 was ‘the furrowd field’, abandoned and barren. She now becomes a spirit of springtime, like Persephone, who rests in the underworld through the winter, and returns in new growth after the plough.

P. 122.17–18 *Jerusalem… out of heaven* ‘And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband’ \(Revelation 21:2\).

21 *my Error remains with me* The results of Error remain, even after repentance. They must be destroyed \(‘All things reversd’, 1.27\) and new works of Truth performed.

27–8 *rattling bones/To bones Join, shaking* The resurrection of the dead. In Ezekiel’s valley of dry bones \(37.7\), ‘there was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone’.

P. 123.5 *They shew their wounds… opressor* The idea of a period of human retaliation and vengeance following the general resurrection occurs in the Koran.

20 ‘Every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all… shall wail because of him’ \(Revelation 1:7\).

27–8 *the Cloud of the Son… Glory* ‘They shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory’ \(Luke 21:27\).

33–8 ‘A throne was set in heaven… And round about the throne were… four and twenty elders sitting… and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind’ \(Revelation 4:2–6\). The Greek for ‘beasts’ is Zωα, which may also be translated ‘living creatures’ or ‘lifes’.

P. 124.5 *the Redeemd Man… Consummation* It is not enough for Christ to pay for \(redeem\) Man’s sins. Man himself must act.

6 *Then siezd the Sons… Plow* Man’s Reason begins the final cycle which ends in a last harvest and vintage, and a feast of bread and wine.

19–21 ‘They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more’ \(Isaiah 2:4\).

30 *the Seed of Men* Ploughing is finished; sowing begins. The seeds are all men’s souls; and ‘that which thou so west is not quickened, except it die’ \(I Corinthians 15:36\).

P. 125.8–10 *warriors*… *Kings & Princes* Soldiers and nobility have no place in Eternity. Therefore they fall on infertile ground, as in the Parable of the Sower \(Luke 8:5–15\).

P. 126.4 *the flaming Demon & Demoness* As Orc at last is consumed in his own flames, Luvah and Vala reappear.

29 *And thus*… *renewd* Luvah and Vala return to their original lives as the Eros and Psyche of Man. *Their* golden age is also the ‘golden age’ of Arcadian Mankind. Thus the style of the following interlude is ‘idyllic’, and the details follow the story of Cupid and Psyche in Apuleius’ *Golden Ass*.

34 B.’s retranslation of *Aeneid* VII. 808–9. Pope’s more famous version is ‘… when swift Camilla scours the Plain/Flies o’er th’unbending corn, and skims along the Main’ *\(Essay on Criticism*, 372–3\).

P. 127.6 *O thou creating voice* Luvah is Vala’s creator, just as Eros is in principle the creator as well as the lover of Psyche.

14–27 *thou art as the grass… survive* An apparent inconsistency, not a real one. Luvah first addresses Vala as a mortal body, and teaches her that ‘All flesh is grass.’ As body, she has been wakened by the sun, is nourished by it, but will die. Vala mourns for herself. But Luvah then addresses her as immortal ‘Soul’ \(1. 24\). As soul, she does not depend on the sun, and will live for ever.

P. 128.3 *a new song arises to my Lord* ‘Sing unto the Lord a new song’ \(Psalm 96:1; 98:1\).

P. 130.7 Tharmas and Enion appear in the first stage of their renewal. Vala \(Nature\) is the foster-mother of Sensation.

P. 131.30–31 *Then Urizen… Cried Times are Ended* The angel in Revelation 10:6 swears ‘that there should be time no longer’. Urizen returns to his work of the Last Harvest.

P. 132.23 *For Lo the winter melted away* ‘For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’ \(Song of Solomon 2:11\).

P. 133.21 In Ephesians 3:10 Paul says his task is to show God’s wisdom to the heavenly powers through the church. Thus the Eternals learn brotherhood by seeing Man grouped into families.

25 *Man liveth not by Self alone* ‘Man shall not live by bread alone’ \(Matthew 4:4\).

P. 134.1 *And all Nations were threshed* The flail threshes the harvest and separates good grain from worthless chaff; the winnowing fan blows away the chaff. The scene suggests Matthew 3:12. where Christ’s ‘fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire’.

5 The fate of the ‘chaff’. *Mystery* is the Rahab of Night VIII, whose cup is ‘full of abominations’ \(Revelation 17:4\). She is overthrown, as in Revelation 18, along with all who serve her.

18–24 Lines repeated from *America* 6.6–12. As the chaff is cast off, the wheat is uncovered. As the oppressors vanish, the oppressed are liberated.

31 *Sing a New Song* ‘Sing unto the Lord a new song’ \(Psalm 96:1; 98:1\).

P. 135.5 *the Vintage is ripe* The vintage follows the harvest in Revelation 14:19–20: ‘And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. And the winepress was trodden… and blood came out of the winepress.’

P. 136.16-P. 137.4 The Vintage of Love is a Dionysiac orgy of ecstatic ruthlessness, reminding us that ‘passion’ means ‘suffering’. The passage is repeated, with additions and alterations, in *M* 27.3–41.

P. 138.20–21 Two lines taken from *America* 6.13–14 begin this final chorale.



### ADDITIONAL FRAGMENTS

These passages appear on two small sheets of paper, and are not incorporated in the text of *The Four Zoas*.



#### ***Three Poems,?*** c. ***1800***

‘A FAIRY SKIPD UPON MY KNEE…’

An undated lyric, written on the blank side of a drawing depicting the infant Hercules.

‘AROUND THE SPRINGS OF GRAY…’; TO MRS ANN FLAXMAN

Two sets of verses inscribed in a volume of B.’s water-colour illustrations to Gray’s poems, presented to Mrs Flaxman. The illustrations may have been done in 1797, but the ‘transplantation’ image apparently refers to Flaxman’s influence on Blake’s move to Felpham in 1800 \(see Poems from Letters, p. 481 below\).



#### ***Poems from Letters***

TO JOHN FLAXMAN, 12 SEPTEMBER 1800

According to Gilchrist, B. met Flaxman, a Swedenborgian and fellow-artist, *c*. 1780, and Henry Fuseli, a painter and intellectual, at about the same time. Flaxman was in Italy from 1787 to 1794. In January 1800 he introduced B. and his work to William Hayley, poet and connoisseur of art. At the time of this letter, the Blakes were preparing to move to Hayley’s cottage in Felpham. They did so on 18 September.

TO MRS FLAXMAN, 14 SEPTEMBER 1800

Written at the close of a letter from Catherine Blake to Mrs Flaxman, again just before the Blakes’ departure for Felpham.

7 *the Turret* Hayley’s house.

15 *the blessd Hermit* Hayley himself.

TO THOMAS BUTTS, 22 NOVEMBER 1802

The vision of Los recorded in this poem may also be a basis for that of B.’s prophetic poem *Milton*.

14–15 *Brother Robert* B.’s favourite, ten years his junior, whom he nursed on his deathbed in 1787, and with whose spirit he said he conversed often afterwards. B.’s Notebook was originally Robert’s.

*Brother John* According to Tatham, John was a rival of William, ‘a dissolute disreputable youth’ who ‘lived a few reckless days, enlisted as a soldier, and died’ \(*Blake Records*, 508–9\).

27 *double the vision* B. cultivated ‘double vision’, ‘threefold vision’ and ‘fourfold vision’, states of altered perception which would commonly be considered hallucinatory.

29 *an old Man grey* An image of Prudence, which B. despised.

31 *If thou goest back* B. was considering a return to London, to escape his patron’s insistence that he confine himself to ‘the meer drudgery of business’ \(letter to Butts, 10 January 1802\).

88 *Newtons sleep* Both the kind of sleep Newton had, and the kind which his philosophy would impose on us.



TO THOMAS BUTTS, 16 AUGUST 1803

Written just before B.’s return to London, in September 1803. The opening line comes from ‘Mary’, Pickering MS., p. 503 below.



#### ***Notebook Poems, c. 1800–1806***

This period of Notebook writing covers Blake’s association with Hayley, his trial for sedition and his depression over the Napoleonic Wars, which were raging both before and after the temporary Peace of Amiens \(1802–3\), and for which B. had given up hope of a political solution. Concurrently, he was writing *Milton*, and \(*c*. 1804\) beginning *Jerusalem*.

‘WHEN KLOPSTOCK ENGLAND DEFIED…’

The German poet Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock \(1724–1803\) was critical of English poetry, which he considered coarse, and blamed this on Swift’s influence. In an article in the London journal *The German Museum*, August 1800, which Hayley might have shown to B., he compared German and English translations of Homer, deprecating the English. Blake’s counter-attack may date from 1800 or earlier, and is of a super-Swiftian crudity.

3–4 Lines quoted from ‘Let the brothels…,’, Notebook, p. 159.



ON THE VIRGINITY OF THE VIRGIN MARY & JOHANNA SOUTHCOTT

Johanna Southcott \(1750–1814\) was a semi-literate servant girl turned prophetess. She announced in 1802 that she was the woman in Revelation 12 who would be the mother of the coming Messiah, in 1813 claimed to be pregnant with this child, and in 1814 died of a dropsy. B.’s squib probably dates from 1802.

‘BENEATH THE WHITE THORN LOVELY MAY…’

A finished copy, entitled ‘The Golden Net’, is in the Pickering MS., p. 498 below.

‘I SAW A MONK…’

Possibly dates *c*. 1804, the period of Blake’s sedition trial; also the year of Richard Warner’s famous pacifist sermon \(see *f*, Pl. 40, n.\) which the Monk seems to echo. From this rough and much-revised draft, B. extracted seven stanzas for *f* Pl. 52, and nine stanzas for ‘The Grey Monk’ in the Pickering MS., p. 505 below.

18 A line drawn in the MS. connects the poem at this point to stanza 12 \(‘Untill the Tyrant himself relent’\) omitting the interlude with the Mother.

28–31 In part an autobiographical complaint. B.’s patron Hayley did not appreciate his writing, and tried to bend him towards more conventional pursuits. See Bentley, *Blake Records*, 72–120 *passim*. There is some evidence that Hayley tried to work through Catherine; B. may have associated Catherine’s illness at Felpham with this spiritual browbeating as well as with the bad climate.

36 A reminiscence of ‘Gwin, King of Norway’, *PS*, p. 32 above. There, too, vengeance is enacted on a tyrant, yet the conclusion implies that vengeance is sad, not sweet.



MORNING

West, in B.’s symbolism, always implies liberation and the opening of a new world. At sunrise, the sun is moving westwards with the speaker.

7–9 *The war of swords & spears… Exhales* The stars \(of Reason\) fade as the dew falls. The same imagery is in ‘The Tyger’, *SE*, p. 125 above.



EACH MAN IS IN HIS SPECTRES POWER

LI. 1–4 appear in *f* Pl. 32, in mirror-writing.



‘MOCK ON MOCK ON…’

Thus Job \(21:3\) to his comforters: ‘Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.’

1 *Voltaire Rousseau* Attacked by B. as rationalists and Deists.

9 *Atoms of Democritus* The Greek philosopher Democritus \(*c*. 460–370 BC\) held that all things were composed of tiny atoms in constant motion. He is the first consistent materialist in western thought, and hence offensive to Blake.

10 *Newtons Particles* In Newton’s optics, light takes the form of tiny corpuscles or particles emitted from a luminous body.



‘MY SPECTRE AROUND ME…’

Dialogue with a coy mistress – or wife. The man speaks stanzas 1–8, the woman stanzas 9–10, the man stanzas 11–12, and both together may speak the final two stanzas.

1–3 *My Spectre… My Emanation* These are B.’s terms for ‘male’ and ‘female’ fragments of a human personality, here enacting a drama of pursuit and rejection.

34 *Seven… loves* The ‘loves’ conceived as Cupids here and in the following stanzas, are the man’s own amorous desires and impulses.

58 *Female Love* Mistaken adoration of the female. Compare Milton’s condemnation of courtship, with its ‘starved Lover’ and ‘proud fair, best quitted with disdain’ \(*Paradise Lost* IV.770\).

59 *root up the Infernal Grove* From Micah 6:14: ‘I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee.’ ‘Groves’, throughout the Authorized Version, occur in connection with worship of the Canaanite goddess Asherah, condemned by the prophets.



‘GROWN OLD IN LOVE…’

B. here is presumably forty-nine, and the year is 1806.



#### ***Poems from the Pickering Manuscript***

This MS. \(owned by B. M. Pickering in 1866\) consists of eleven leaves containing fair copies of lyric and ballad pieces, primarily on the themes of sexuality, politics and the nature of visionary experience. Most editors date it *c*. 1803; Stevenson conjectures 1805.



THE GOLDEN NET

An allegory of male entrapment by females. A draft of this poem is in the Notebook, p. 489.



THE MENTAL TRAVELLER

This is one of B.’s most difficult short poems. It is an allegory of mankind’s history, represented as a process of alternating dominance of male and female principles. The male, beginning as a babe and becoming a youth, mature man, old man and finally babe again, is a Jesus–Prometheus–Everyman figure who embodies the potential genius and energy of Mankind. The female, variously manifested as old woman, virgin, female babe and finally old woman again, embodies all that may control, thwart or reject him. Comparable figures in B.’s longer works are ORC \(Revolution\) and VALA \(Nature\).

In the opening sequence, the babe is nailed down and tormented by Mother Nature, who may also represent any Church or State founded on Nature. He subdues her as he grows to maturity, and becomes a source of joy to others, but in old age is driven out by a female babe sprung from his hearth – possibly a Church founded on his deeds, which gains ascendancy and forgets its source. In the final sequence, his pursuit of a new maiden returns him to infancy and her to old age. A whole civilization has been formed from their distress, and the whole cycle resumes.

7–8 *Reap in joy*… *sow* In Psalm 126:5, ‘They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.’ But a joyous birth after a woeful begetting implies that something is sexually amiss in this world.

11–16 These torments suggest the fate of Prometheus, that of Jesus, and that of sacrificial victims in Mexico. Similar tortures are inflicted by females on male victims in *FZ* VIII.105.31–53, IX.136.21–137.1, *M* 19.44–55, 27.30–38, 67.24–5, 67.41–62, 80.81–2.

23–4 *he rends up… binds her down* See the story of Orc and the ‘shadowy female’ in the preludium to *America*, p. 208 above.

51 *aged Host* Puns on the ‘Host’ of the Eucharist, Christ’s body, now rejected.

56 *a Maiden* The Maiden resembles the elusive mistress of ‘My Spectre around me’, Notebook, p. 494, and the artful virgins of ‘The Golden Net’; in the end she is revealed as another manifestation of the Woman Old.

57 *to allay his freezing Age* Similarly, when King David ‘was old and stricken in years; and… gat no heat’, his counsellors brought him a fair damsel to ‘lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat’ \(1 Kings 1: 1–2\). What follows, however, is squabbling over David’s throne among his heirs; as here, the world is turned to a hostile desert.

63–4 As male vitality and all that it represents declines, perceptions become narrow and the world becomes alien. B. thought that the flatness or roundness of the earth depended on one’s vision, and believed that a flat earth implied expansiveness in an ‘infinite plane’, while a round globe separated from other globes implied limitation.

69–81 The infant lovers Los and Enitharmon, *FZ* 1.9.24, p. 284 above, are likewise tormented by ‘Alternate Love & Hate… Scorn & Jealousy’.

95 *the Babe is Born* Blake proposes that the birth into this world of Jesus, or any form of human energy, is greeted by society with terror, not love, for it is a true threat to the *status quo.*

MARY

21 Blake uses this line, but applies it to himself, in the verse conclusion of a letter to Butts, 16 August 1803, p. 487 above.



THE CRYSTAL CABINET

The experience of love as a delightfully beautiful yet imprisoning enclosure first appears in ‘How sweet I roam’d…’, *PS*, p. 26 above, supposedly written before B. was fourteen. ‘I saw a chapel all of gold…’, Notebook, p. 136, employs similar enclosure imagery to describe sexuality.

15 *Threefold* Blake consistently associates ‘threefold vision’ \(a physiological possibility for him\) with the state of lovely and dreamy sexuality he called BEULAH. Perception is heightened in this state, yet it remains inferior to the ‘fourfold vision’ he considered fully human. In other words: sexual love can take one only so far, and no further. Another autobiographical treatment of altered states of vision – ‘twofold’, ‘threefold’ and ‘fourfold’ – occurs in the poem ‘With happiness stretchd across the hills…’, which concludes a letter to Butts, 22 November 1802, p. 485 above.

24 *like a weeping Babe became* Desire is physically gratified, but full union has not been achieved. The ‘Babe’ and ‘Woman’ are also in ‘The Mental Traveller’, above, p. 499.



THE GREY MONK

A rough draft, with additional stanzas, is in the Notebook, p. 491.



AUGURIES OF INNOCENCE

These couplets were written as a fair copy, although the organization and grouping of ideas seem erratic. Editors have suggested other arrangements of the lines, but B.’s apparent failure to organize may have been deliberate.

17 *The Game Cock clipd* Cockfighting was not legally prohibited in England until 1849.

35 *Chafers sprite* A chafer is a kind of beetle.

126 Seeing ‘through’ rather than ‘with’ the eye constituted true vision for B. The conclusion to his prose tract, *A Vision of the Last Judgment*, reads:

‘I assert for My self that I do not behold the Outward Creation & that to me it is hindrance & not Action it is as the Dirt upon my feet No part of Me. What it will be Questiond When the Sun rises do you not see a round Disk of fire somewhat like a Guinea O no no I see an Innumerable company of the Heavenly host crying Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God Almighty I question not my Corporeal or Vegetative Eye any more than I would Question a Window concerning a Sight I look thro it & not with it.’

127 *Born in a Night… Night* Jonah’s gourd ‘came up in a night and perished in a night’ \(Jonah 4:10\). The moral is that material things are less important than spiritual.

129–30 *God is Light… Night* Ironic commentary on Milton’s ‘since God is light’, *Paradise Lost* 111.3.



WILLIAM BOND

28 From the words of Jesus to Mary at Cana: ‘Woman, what have I to do with thee?’ \(John 2:4\).



*Milton*

An illuminated poem known in four copies. Title page date: 1804. Two copies, on paper watermarked 1808, contain forty-five plates, eight of which are full-page designs without text. A third copy, on the same paper, adds five pages of text \(3, 4, 10, 18, 32\) but omits the Preface. The last copy, on paper dated 1815, omits the Preface and adds one more page \(5\). The present text follows the page-arrangement of this copy.

B. originally intended *Milton* to be a ‘Poem in 12 Books’ but altered the title page ‘12’ to ‘2’. As it now stands, the poem is just half the size of *Jerusalem*, and is something like a prelude to it. It tells the story of the poet Milton’s descent to earth and entry into William Blake, an event at once intimately personal and of cosmic reverberation.

B. assumes that the poet’s task is no less than the salvation of Mankind. He acts through divine inspiration and conveys – as best he can, within his historic and personal limitations – divine truth. As history proceeds, poets embody more and more of truth, and expose more and more of error. The final result of this process will be the Coming of Jesus. Now, as B. sees it, Milton was a true poet, but did not escape error. His self-righteous religion interfered with his vision. To correct this, Milton must return to earth, annihilate his moralistic selfhood, and reunite with his rejected inspiration, which takes the form of a female ‘emanation’ Ololon. He is aided in this quest by all the powers of divine imagination, and assailed by all the powers of mundane error. His ultimate success brings the entire universe a step nearer to its final fulfilment in Jesus.

It seems clear that B. experienced a moment of revelation in which he ‘saw’ all this happening, one day in his Felpham garden, and fainted. His recording of this central event is placed in a mythological and doctrinal context, so that the narrative is interrupted by sub-narratives and digressions, which ‘explain’ the story. Thus, as in *The Four Zoas*, all earthly action occurs within the form of Albion, the sleeping giant who has fallen away from union with the divine family of Eternals who are one with Jesus. Again, as in *FZ*, there is descent from higher to lower realms of potential human consciousness and imagination: Eden to Beulah to Generation to Ulro. Third, a geographical symbolism is developed in which British and biblical places and historical events are equivalents of each other. This rests on Blake’s assumption that all nations were originally one within Albion, and allows him to place Milton’s journey simultaneously in England and in Palestine. Finally, there is the highly developed figure of Los, the ‘Eternal Prophet’ or spirit of poetry, father of all individual poets and intellectuals throughout history, whose task is the creation of a City of Art in the midst of the fallen world. Los plays various roles in this poem. Sometimes he is in the background behind the action, sometimes he is interceding in it. A Bard’s Song concerning troubles in the family of Los inspires Milton’s descent to earth. Los himself watches over this descent; and he as well as Milton enters into William Blake. In other words, throughout this poem, wherever an act of the human imagination is occurring, there one finds Los.

In epic literature, the closest parallels to *Milton* are John Milton’s *Paradise Regained*, Dante’s *Purgatorio* and Homer’s *Odyssey.*

Title *To Justify the Ways of God to Men* From Milton’s prayer in the Invocation to *Paradise Lost* \(1.26\):

What in me is dark

Illumine, what is low raise and support;  
That to the highth of this great argument  
I may assert eternal Providence,  
And justify the ways of God to Men.



PREFACE

Pl. 1.6 *consciously & professedly Inspired Men* The authors of the Bible.

7–8 *Daughters of Memory*… *Daughters of Inspiration* The classical Muses are daughters of Mnemosyne \(Memory\). B.’s own Muses resemble Milton’s ‘Heav’nly Muse’ \(*Paradise Lost* 1.6\).

9–10 *malady and infection*… *Sword* Malady and infection derived from classical writers who celebrated War.



BOOK THE FIRST

Invocation. Milton, unhappy though in heaven, hears a Bard’s Song \(Pls. 2–13\) concerning LOS, the Eternal Prophet, and his family. In this song, which allegorizes Blake’s difficulties with his patron Hayley, SATAN \(Hayley\) precipitates a quarrel with PALAMABRON \(Blake\) which results in Satan’s exclusion from Los’s family and his identification with URIZEN \(the god of Reason and Moral Law\).

Hearing the song, Milton \(Pl. iv\) realizes that he himself is a Satanic selfhood, and he resolves to go down to Eternal Death. In the following action, he enters something like a dream state. His ‘real self’ remains asleep in EDEN, guarded by the seven angels of the Presence. But subjectively he enters his shadow and begins a descent from BEULAH \(the dreamland of poetic inspiration\) to ULRO \(our earth, B.’s equivalent of hell\). Approaching earth \(Pl. 15\), he sees ALBION asleep on the rock of ages, then drops like a shooting star into B.’s foot. He passes his six females, who tempt him with all his former errors as a poet. He journeys about the MUNDANE SHELL. The FOUR ZOAS see him, and Los – misunderstanding his purpose – tries to stop him. The SHADOWY FEMALE \(Nature\) responds to his advent with a promise of cruelty \(Pl. 18\) which Orc begs her to change. Urizen and Milton meet and struggle on the shores of Arnon \(Pl. 19\). Albion stirs in sleep as Milton descends through his heart. Meanwhile ‘the real Milton’ and his guardians are driven out of heaven by a group of wrathful Eternals.

Then Los realizes Milton’s true mission is the liberation of Orc \(Revolutionary Energy\). The Eternals in OLOLON, who drove Milton out, realize this also \(Pl. 21\), and repentantly resolve to follow him to Ulro. The Divine Family, united in Jesus, is with them in this quest.

Los descends and becomes one with Blake \(Pl. 22\). His sons Rintrah and Palamabron express fear of Milton and his religion. Los tries to reassure them and urges patience, but they are unconvinced. Here the narrative of Book I ends. The conclusion of the Book \(Pls. 24–9\) describes the works of Los, which include all creative effort both within the human organism and within society.

P1. 2.1–15 The Invocation, highly condensed like that of Milton’s *Paradise Lost.*

1 *Daughters of Beulah* B.’s Muses dwell in the dreamland of Beulah which is a realm of reposeful sexuality and artistic inspiration. These things are ‘delusions’ compared with man’s ‘real’ life in Eternity, but they are nevertheless far superior to our ordinary experience. Asking their help B. implies an anatomy of poetic creation, traced back to its divine source. This final source is ‘The Eternal Great Humanity Divine’ \(1. 8\), Jesus, of whom all men are members.

9 *the Spectres of the Dead* Fallen human beings, who in the poet’s imagination become true images of God.

10 *the False Tongue* The voice of Satan, and of all religious doctrine which accuses men of sin and demands atonement. ‘What shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper’ \(Psalm 120\).

17 *One hundred years* An approximate figure. Milton died in 1674. *intricate mazes* ‘mazes intricate’ \(*Paradise Lost* v.622\).

19 *Sixfold Emanation* Milton’s three wives and three daughters; but also the ‘female’ qualities which he condemned and rejected within himself and his art.

25 *Mark well my words\!* Here begins the Bard’s Song. This line is repeated as a periodic refrain in it.

26 *Three Classes are Created* Three classes of Mankind exist in this world. The Reprobates are rebels, the Elect are orthodox and selfrighteous \(like the ‘devils’ and ‘angels’ of *MHH*\). The Redeemed are mid-way, uncertain of what is right. The definitions are given in 7.1–3 \(which originally followed Pl. 2 directly\) and 25.31–7.

*the Hammer of Los* LOS, the Eternal Prophet, labours as a blacksmith, creating permanent and definite forms for indefinite ideas. He and his sons create the intellectual history of Mankind, which for B. is its *real* history.

P1. 3 This plate is a late addition. It gives background on the Fall of Man, the creation of the material body and the development of the family of Los.

1 *Enitharmon’s looms* ENITHARMON is the EMANATION of Los. She and her daughters, throughout the poem, ‘weave’ the generated bodies of men. The looms symbolize motherhood.

*Albion was slain* ALBION \(mankind\) lies in a death-like sleep throughout the course of this poem. The full story of his fall is in *FZ, passim.*

6 *Urizen lay in darkness* The following passage retells *BU* 10.31–13.20. The creation of a limited physical body, beginning with an enclosed skull and heart, is an essential part of the Fall of Man.

33 *separated into a Female* The creation of Enitharmon. See *BU* 13.50–19.1.

36 *separated into a Male* The creation of the Spectre of Los.

39 *They Builded Great Golgonooza* Los and his Spectre built the City of Art.

41–3 *Satan… Miller of Eternity… Prince of the Starry Wheels* SATAN, Los and Enitharmon’s youngest son, is a miller; the Starry Wheels turn like mill wheels and are associated with Urizenic Reason. Satan is, in fact, a form of URIZEN.

P1. 4\] This plate is a late addition.

1–2 *Beneath… Rintrah &… Palamabron* Satan should be subservient to his brothers RINTRAH and PALAMABRON; their plough and harrow are more important than his mill.

3 *the Mundane Shell* The sky. For its creation by Urizen, see *FZ* 11.23.8–31.15.

6–14 Los’s speech to Satan, who wants to tend the harrow instead of his own mills.

11 *Newtons Pantocrator* A bitter pun. Panto crator means: \(1\) ‘Omnipotent Lord’ \(a traditional epithet for Christ\); \(2\) ‘A copying machine’ \(a coinage of Newton’s\).

12 *Shaddai* Heb. ‘Almighty’.

21 *South Molton Street* where B. lived at No. 17 after leaving Felpham in 1803, and *Stratford Place* are at the foot of Tyburn Hill. B. identifies Tyburn gallows with Calvary.

22 *the Victims… their Cherubim* Cherubim usually signify prohibition in B., but the victims here are turning the tables on their guardians. Probably this is autobiographical. B. is taking the courage to write.

Pl. 5 This plate is a late addition, found only in one copy of the poem. It contains the lament of the Daughters of Albion over Man’s limited perceptions. The Daughters create the three classes of men, and offer consoling delight to two \(the Reprobate and Redeemed, who are ‘contraries’\), but not to the Elect, who are the ‘reasoning negative’.

1–3 The fiery harrow, artillery and Sin are equated; Palamabron and Christ could bear the heat; Satan could not.

19–26 Repeated with alterations in *f* 40.39–42.

27 Limited perceptions produce restrictive moral codes; these reinforce worship of Babylon.

39–40 *Charles… Cromwell… James* Historical examples of the three classes of men.

*James calls for fires* because the Catholics were popularly blamed for starting the great fire of London \(1666\); James II was Catholic.

P1. 6\] This plate is an interpolation, but is contained in all copies of the poem.

1 *Golgonooza*… *London* The City of Art is a spiritual and fully realized version of the city of this world.

6 *Enitharmons Loom* The weaving of Enitharmon parallels the hammering of Los as creative labour.

12 *Rintrah, Palamabron, Theotormon, Bromion* Four sons of Los.

14 *Lambeths Vale* The area of London where B. lived 1791–1800. B. insists that Jerusalem was ‘builded here’ before the fall of Albion.

16 *Oak Groves rooted* Druidism substituted for the ruined original City of God, Jerusalem.

23–4 *Babel*… *glory & war* England has grown to be an empire instead of a sacred land.

P1. 7 Here begins the main line of the Bard’s story, the conflict between Satan and Palamabron. This in part allegorizes the quarrel between Blake \(Palamabron\) and his patron Hayley \(Satan\). Hayley considered himself an important poet and Blake an eccentric dependant. Blake disagreed.

4–6 *Satan… soft intreated Los* Hayley wished to be considered a major poet.

10 *blamable* May refer to Los, who should not have succumbed to Satan-Hayley’s nagging; or to Palamabron-Blake, who should not have suppressed his anger.

P1. 8.4–5 *Satan… found all confusion* For Blake, trying to do the trivial work Hayley recommends, has ‘marred’ it with his own ideas.

26 *the cliffs of the Dead* The brows of mortal men.

27–8 *Jehovahs rain, & Molechs/Thick fires* Epic epithets; a storm of rain and lightning. \(Molech was a Canaanite god of fire and childsacrifice.\)

30 *Theotormon & Bromion* Sons of Los, they also appear in *VDA* as a pair with limited vision. Here, they possibly represent artist-friends of Hayley’s.

31 *trembling at eternal death* See 4.17. Satan’s ‘work is Eternal Death’.

32–4 *Michael, Thulloh, Rintrah* Sons of Los opposed to Satan. Possibly they all represent artist-acquaintances of Blake and Hayley, sympathetic to Blake.

43 *She form’d a Space* The formation of spaces around offending figures is in B. always an act of female mercy, which protects and encloses the offender, and at the same time prevents the infection from spreading to others.

46 *Palamabron called down* Palamabron at last takes action; Blake quarrels publicly with Hayley.

P1. 9.8 *the Two Witnesses* A theological pun. One may ‘witness’ in a law court or ‘witness’ for Christ. The prophecy of two martyred witnesses of God is in Revelation 11:3–10.

10 *it fell on Rintrah* This judgement is explained below, 11.15–26

10–11 *his rage… against Palamabron* Satan-Hayley at last loses his temper; an Elect behaving like a Reprobate.

19–29 Satan insisting on principles of sin and punishment reveals himself as ‘the Accuser who is the God of this world’. Hayley is a representative of these principles, though until now disguised in mild politeness.

32–3 *the stones becoming opake/Hid him* Satan has ‘hardened his heart’.



46 *Satan not having… Wrath* Satan not knowing how to express the emotion of anger simply and directly. Cf. ‘A Poison Tree’, *SE*, p. 129 above: ‘I told my wrath, my wrath did end.’

50 *the seven mountains of Rome* The seven Churches.

51 The COVERING CHERUB guards Paradise and prevents Man’s re-entry. B. identifies this figure with the false religions of Rome, Babylon and Tyre. The symbolism suggested here is further developed in *J.*

P1. 10\] This plate is a late addition.

8–10 *Satan… Became Canaan* Satan is becoming a god of this world, and Canaan is becoming his exclusive holy land. A false and divisive holiness will necessarily precipitate War \(1. 11\). The geographical symbolism here is further developed *j.*

12–13 *their God*… *nor King* Neither Church nor State can be worshipped by Poetry.

14–19 *Elynittria… And Ocalythron* Here begins a new theme, that of sexual jealousy and possessiveness as the source of human conflict. ELYNITTRIA is Palamabron’s emanation \(Catherine Blake\). OCALYTHRON is mentioned in *Europe*, but not developed.

P1. 11.1 *Eon* Another word for ‘emanation’. JERUSALEM is Albion’s emanation.

13 *the Spectres of the Dead* Misguided mortal men.

14 *the Unutterable Name* The Tetragrammaton, the name of God which it was forbidden to pronounce aloud; another sign of falsely ‘holy’ divinity, since God and Man should be one.

17–18 *If the Guilty*… *Eternity* To punish the guilty prevents them from reforming themselves, and perpetuates a cycle of punishment.

28 *Leutha* In *Europe*, a temptress-figure. Here she is Satan’s emanation \(i.e., Inspiration\). Her plea is that Satan-Hayley must not be blamed for a false Inspiration.

P1. 12.10–41 Leutha’s version of Satan-Hayley’s attempts to be a great poet. He cannot handle the fires of creativity \(11. 10–23\), his doctrines are anti-libertarian \(to devour Albion and Jerusalem, 1. 27\), he adds insult to injury \(the Serpent is the subtle liar and reasoner of *Pl.* ix\) in criticizing Blake \(11. 29–34\). When contradicted, he retracts \(1. 36\). When he cannot succeed in writing, he continues to lecture \(11. 37–8\). When Blake returns to the scene, full of his own inspiration \(11. 40–42\), Hayley at first keeps his ideas to himself, then disclaims them.

10 *I sprang out of the breast of Satan* As Sin sprang from Satan’s brow in *Paradise Lost* 11.752–60.

39 *And call’d me… held me* Quotes *Paradise Lost* 11.760–61.

P1. 13.2 Hayley’s egotism is still agitated.

8 *All is my Fault… Spectre of Luvah* In an excess of contrition, Leutha incorrectly identifies herself and Satan with Luvah \(who in *FZ* has his own part to bear in the ruin of Albion\).

17 *Six Thousand years* From 4004 BC, the supposed date of creation, to an anticipated apocalypse.

17–23 *Lucifer… Jehovah* The SEVEN EYES OF GOD, a succession of deities presiding over periods of fallen history, each inadequate until the coming of the Lamb. See Dictionary of Proper Names.

35 *the fatal Brook* Tyburn \(identified with Calvary\).

43–4 *Leutha lived/In Palamabrons Tent* Blake studied and came to understand what Hayley represented in Art and Doctrine.

P1. 14.9 Milton understood and believed the Bard, and was instantly inspired to act upon what he had heard.

18 *O when Lord Jesus wilt thou come?* The final promise and prayer of the New Testament was Revelation 22:20: ‘He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly: Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.’

30–32 The key moral statement of the poem. All selfhood is Satanic. Milton had created a hell in *Paradise Lost* for his ‘Satan’. Now he must recognize that Satan is a part of himself. He must also recognize that fire is not ‘Hell’, but the proper element of the poet labouring at his ‘furnaces’ of creation. ‘Eternal Death’ is the ‘life’ of this world.

36 *he beheld his own Shadow* \(1\) His lower self; \(2\) the influence of his writing in the world.

37 *hermaphroditic* The hermaphroditic form in B. is a sterile parody of humanity in Eden, which transcends divided sexuality and is androgynous.

39 *twenty-seven-fold* For the ‘twenty-seven heavens and their churches’, see 37.35ff. and Dictionary of Proper Names.

40 *direst Hell* Ulro, the world of complete dead mechanism.

42*Seven Angels of the Presence* The term is from Isaiah 63:7–9, speaking of God’s love for his children: ‘In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them.’ Thus these are figures of compassion, one for each of the Eyes of God named on Pl. 13. The Seven, joined by Milton \(15.5\), make Eight, and at the close of the poem \(42.10–11\) ‘the Starry Eight became/One Man, Jesus the Saviour’.

Pl. 15.8 *Polypus* Octopus or jellyfish; a symbol of poisonous vagueness, later developed by B. as a major image for the material body. Milton now exists in three forms: walking about as a divine image in Eden, sleeping in Beulah, and descending lonely to the world of Generation.

19 *a comet* Mortal men \(here called Spectres\) see Milton as a comet or falling star.

21–35 ‘Vortex’ is a term in Cartesian cosmology meaning ‘sphere of influence’ around a star \(Stevenson\). In B.’s adaptation, a vortex is any idea or philosophy which makes a whole world to itself, and each is a form of human experience. The traveller, while *within* a vortex, sees it as we see our own world – our little circle of cornfields and valleys with the heavenly bodies above – i.e., partially. Having *left* a vortex, he may see it from the outside as a closed system, a globe separated from him, or he may see it \(more truly\) as a human form, a friend.

45–7 *so Milton’s shadow fell… falling star* Compare the fall of Mulciber in *Paradise Lost* 1.742–5: ‘From morn/To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve/A summer’s day; and with the setting sun/Dropp’d from the zenith like a falling star.’

P1. 15.51–Pl. 17.1 *the Three Heavens… three females* Milton’s mortal loves had represented the whole of female beauty \(in head, heart and loins\) to him.

P1. 16 A full-page design shows Milton striving with Urizen. Inscription reads: ‘To Annihilate the Self-hood of Deceit & False Forgiveness’.

P1. 17.2–3 *that they… Selfhood* In order that they \(the twice three females, Milton’s emanation\) might be renewed to life and reassumed as a part of Milton’s being, by his surrender of his narrower selfhood.

7 *Female forms* Temptations which now surround him.

11 *Rahab and Tirzah* The Whore of Babylon and her daughter the cruel Virgin collectively come to represent female will embodied in false religions.

    *Tirzah, Milcah, Malah, Noah, Hoglah* Daughters of Zelophehad who became his heirs. For B. they represent the materialism of the five senses, and a triumph of female will. Thus the idea here is: Milton’s wives and daughters \(his collective emanation\) contain the beauty of his poetic inspiration derived from Beulah, but they also contain the error of his false puritanic doctrines of Moral Law derived from Ulro. Mt Horeb or Sinai is the site of the Commandments and Law.

13–14 *they wrote… His dictate* Milton’s daughters were his secretaries in his old age, when he was blind.

16 *Hor… Hermon* Mountains and mountainous regions in and around Palestine.

20*Edom*… *Amalek* Tribes bordering Palestine.

31 *Los the Vehicular terror* Los is the vehicle of all poetry and prophecy. But he and Enitharmon here misunderstand Milton’s mission, and resist it.

P1. 18 This plate is a late addition. Further implications of Milton’s descent are explored through an interchange between the SHADOWY FEMALE and ORC. The full story of these two figures \(not important here\) occurs in the preludium to *Europe*, and in *FZ* vii \[a\] and viii.

2 *The Shadowy Female* Vala, bride of Luvah-Orc, in her fallen form becomes a brutalized Nature. Here she represents primitive hardships of natural existence and the Natural Religion that results.

26 *Take not the Human Form* Orc replies that the female, which is but half of humanity, should not pretend to be the whole. Nature, which is but a passive and fallen material aspect of the universe, should not pretend to be its totality.

39–41 *Oothoon & Leutha* parallel *Jerusalem* & *Babylon* as contrary aspects of female character – one representing Liberty, one representing Bondage. They are both ‘within’ the Shadowy Female as potential developments.

P1. 19 A climax of the first part of the poem. Milton encounters URIZEN, and is tempted by RAHAB and TIRZAH. His response is to give warm life and human form to the cold and death-dealing god of Reason, and to ignore the temptations. In the geographical symbolism, *Arnon* \(1. 6\) is a river of birth, *Jordan* \(1. 8\) a river of deathly baptism. *Mahanaim* \(1. 7\) is the plain where Jacob had his vision of the angels. *Succoth* \(1. 10\) is on the border of Jordan, and had ‘clay ground’ \(I Kings 7:46\). *Red clay* is what Adam was made of, and is the Hebrew meaning of his name. *The Valley of Beth Peor* \(1. 14\) is the burial place of Moses, just short of the promised land which he never entered. In the ‘enticement’ passage below \(19.36–20.6\), Milton must resist crossing the river into a promised land of self-righteous holiness.

15–24 *Four Universes… without end* A brief recapitulation of the fall of the Four Zoas, and the cosmic geography through which Milton presently travels. *South* \(Intellect\) is the region abandoned by Urizen and wrongly appropriated by Luvah. *East* was abandoned by Luvah. *West* is Tharmas, *North* is Urthona. They are also the four elements fire, air, water, earth. \(See also 34.32–9, *f* 59.10–17.\)

27–8 *Rahab… and Tirzah* form the sum of Milton’s temptations to holiness, which was his former error as a poet.

36–7 *Come thou to Ephraim*… *Canaan… Amalekites* A temptation to political power over the Promised Land and its enemies. \(B. is thinking here of Milton’s career as propagandist for Cromwell.\)

39 *The banks of Cam* The site of Cambridge University, where Milton studied.

41–3 *Ahania… Enion… Vala* The estranged emanations of Urizen, Tharmas and Luvah. Their sufferings are detailed in *FZ.*

46 A temptation to subject Christian art \(Jerusalem\) to pagan art \(the Grecian lyre\). B. evidently felt that Milton had compromised himself on this issue by his use of classical mythology.

48 *Let her be Offerd up to Holiness\!* A temptation to sacrifice true faith to impersonal ‘Holiness’ and analytic theologizing; here again, B. is criticizing Milton’s poetry.

55 *She ties the knot* Tirzah ties the brain, heart and genitals into limited forms. This is a temptation to believe in the reality of the material world and the material body.

58–9 *Hand, Hyle* & *Coban, Scofield, Reuben* See ALBION, SONS OF, and ISRAEL, SONS OF. These figures are important in *f* but not here.

P1. 20.3–6 A concluding temptation to be a spiritual dictator. *Ephraim & Manasseh* In biblical history, secessionist \(hence faithless\) regions of which Tirzah was capital.

*Hazor* A Canaanite town whose king unsuccessfully led twelve tribes against the conquering Israelites.

15–18 Blake interrupts himself at the daunting prospect of the high things to come in his narrative, as Milton does for the Invocation to Light which opens *Paradise Lost* III.

16 *the Four-fold Man* The Divine Humanity, Albion with his Four Zoas.

33 *Og & Anak* Biblical giants, foes of Israel who suffered crushing defeats. The implication is that they seem more dangerous than they are.

43–5 *the Eternals… wrathful* at the sight of Milton, not understanding the reason for his descent, drive his human form into Ulro. Thus begins a new major action in the poem. See 21.16–44.

46 *the Watchers* The seven angels guarding Milton.

47 *the Shadowy Eighth* Milton’s sleeping Humanity.

52 *Rintrah* & *Palamabron* Honest Wrath and Pity, Los’s sons. See the Bard’s Song, Pl. 14 above; see also the Dictionary of Proper Names.

53 *Reuben, Gad* In Joshua 22 their apparent rebellion against God proves unreal; they are faithful. But in *FZ* VIII these are faithless sons of Los.

P1. 21.16 *Ololon* is a region, but also its inhabitants. It will later be identified with Milton’s emanation.

    *those who Milton drove* Those who drove Milton are the wrathful Eternals of 20.43. Here they are identified as Ololon.

20 *sulphur Sun* The material sun. Sulphur is a ‘base’ element in alchemical theory.

24 *Providence began* The family of Eden now became aware of Milton’s self-sacrifice, and began to gather its forces to help.

45 *Ololon* The dwellers in Ololon, who will later unite with Milton’s divided emanation, and reunite with Milton at the close of the poem.

47–50 Ololon attempts to understand ‘this world of Sorrow’. Is the sorrow a form of punishment? It is a refuge from the strenuous mental wars of Eternity, but an unnatural one. Is it, then, a form of repentance? Ololon resolves to ‘enter into’ the suffering of the world: to investigate and to participate.

51–7 This is the guiding speech of Providence, which implicitly ‘began’ on 1. 24.

60 From Matthew 26:64: ‘Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man… coming in the clouds of heaven.’

P1. 22 Los enters Blake and triumphantly announces the role of prophetic art. But working against his confident assurance is the fear of his sons that ‘Miltons Religion’ will perpetuate all the old errors.

31 *Whence is this Shadow* Los’s sons identify the shadow of Milton with his self-righteous puritanism. They fear that \(11. 32–3\) ‘he/Will unchain Orc’ \(instigate War\), and will ‘let loose Satan, Og, Sihon & Anak’ \(a quaternary of vague threat-figures\). Sihon, like Og and Anak \(20.33\), was a giant king? ‘utterly destroyed’ \(Joshua 2:10\) by Israel.

38 *Jealousy of Theotormon* The sexual jealousy and craving for purity \(see *VDA*\) which underlies all religions of virtue.

41 *Voltaire*… *Rousseau* Though traditional religions and Churches seem dead, their errors are perpetuated. Voltaire’s worldly scepticism and Rousseau’s Natural Religion still encourage selfrighteousness, deny the value of enthusiasm and self-sacrifice, support the State, are legalistic, are able to pervert true vision, condemn true liberty, and allow divine matters to remain in the hands of Mystery, when they should be the province of all men’s capacity for spiritual vision.

50–54 A critique of Swedenborg’s writings \(cf. *MHH* Pl. 21\).

P1. 22.55–Pl. 23.2 *Whitefield*… *Westley* For B., the great eighteenth-century English evangelists were men of true vision unperverted by rationalism. He identifies them with the martyred ‘witnesses’ of Revelation 11:3–10.

P1. 23.6 *Lo Orc arises* Political revolutions have already begun.

11–12 *How long… How long* In Revelation 6:9–11 the souls of the martyrs ‘cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge…? and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season’ \(as in Los’s reply \(1. 32\), ‘be patient yet a little’\).

15–16 *Hand, Hyle & Coban… Gwendolen & Conwenna* Sons and daughters of Albion who deny faith and liberty. These figures are further developed in *J, passim.*

32 *O noble Sons, be patient* This scene is Los’s Gethsemane – he begs, ‘watch with me one hour’ \(Matthew 26:40\).

39 *These lovely Females* Daughters of Beulah. Los is reminding his sons that they have allies in the task.

51 *powers fitted to circumscribe* Los explains that the work of art at once defines and places limits on the experience of fallen Mankind.

53 Compare the speech of the Clod of Clay in *Thel* 5.5; and the speech of Jesus in Matthew 26:42: ‘O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.’ Also see Mark 13:24–33, where the Lord’s return in glory is promised soon, ‘But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels… neither the Son… Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.’

62 *Twelve Sons* The twelve tribes of Israel.

P1. 24.2–3 *Reuben*… *Judah* Seven of the twelve tribes of Israel.

3–4 *Generated*… *with Tirzah* Became mere mortals subject to Nature.

6 *We called him Menassheh* \(From Hebrew *Nasheh*, ‘cause to forget’.\) Joseph’s son, born in Egypt, so named because ‘God… hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house’ \(Genesis 41:51\).

20 *Ephraim & Menassheh* Egyptian-born sons of Joseph.

27 *the Vehicular Body* The emblem.

29 *the Sleeping Body* of Albion.

35 *Cathedrons Looms weave only Death* The looms of Enitharmon are uncreative when not working in conjunction with the labours of Los and his sons.

47 *no hope of an end* Here the narrative of Book I ceases. The remainder of Book I describes the sorrow and joy of the labours of Los. See Dictionary of Proper Names for GOLGONOOZA; BOWLAHOOLA; ALLAMANDA; LUBAN.

71 *the ever apparent Elias* The prophet Elijah, traditionally herald of the Messiah, is identified with Los.

76 *the Throne Divine* From Revelation 4:2–6 ‘and behold a throne was set in heaven… and round about the throne, were four beasts \[lit. Zωα, ‘living creatures’\] full of eyes before and behind’. Los is the fourth Zoa.

P1. 25\] In two copies of the poem, Pls. 25–7 are arranged 26, 27, 25.

1 *the Wine-presses* B’s image for ‘war on earth’, derived from imagery of the violent last harvest and vintage in Revelation 14:14–20 and 19:15, where the winepress is identified with the wrath of God, crushing the nations of the earth. In *FZ* IX. 135.21–137.23, the last vintage and the winepress of Luvah are apocalyptic. Here the image refers specifically to the Napoleonic wars as harbingers of apocalypse.

22 *The Awakener* From 21.33, ‘Milton the Awakener’. The meaning is \(1\) one who himself wakes up; \(2\) one who wakes others.

23 Albion himself begins to awake.

42 *the Mundane Egg* Our ‘three-dimensional world of time and space, in which fallen Man incubates until he hatches and re-enters Eternity’ \(Damon, *Dictionary\).* It is surrounded by the Mundane Shell, the sky.

44 *you sowed in tears* From Psalm 126:4–6: ‘Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south. They that sow in tears shall reap in joy. He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.’

48–50 *Lambeth ruin’d… Apollo… Asylum… Hercules* Blake complains of the use of classical names \(and the spirit implied by the names\) in his English neighbourhood, Lambeth. His house was in ‘Hercules Buildings’, near by lay ‘Apollo Gardens’ and the Royal Asylum for Female Orphans.

55 *Jerusalem… all Nations* From Isaiah 2:2–4: ‘And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains… and all nations shall flow unto it… for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem… and they shall beat their swords into plowshares…’

61 *the Lamb & his Bride* From Revelation 21:2: ‘And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem… prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.’

71 *the calm Ocean joys beneath & smooths* From Milton’s ‘Nativity Ode’, 64–6: ‘The Winds, with wonder whist/Smoothly the waters kiss’t/Whispering new joys to the mild Ocean.’

P1. 26.11 *the hem of their garments* In Matthew 14:35–6 all the diseased were brought to Jesus ‘that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole’.

13 *Two Gates* The cave of the nymphs \(*Odyssey* XIII\) had two gates, the north for men, the south for gods. In neo-Platonic interpretation the cave was mortal life, the northern gate was for souls ascending from bodies after death.

14–15 The locations are cliffs facing the ocean at the far north and far south of Britain.

18 *Los against the east* East is the realm abandoned and left ‘void’ by Luvah. Los has his back to it.

19 *Hounslow to Blackheath* West to east of London.

23–5 The place-names are locations in and around Golgonooza, Los’s City of Art.

31–2 *every Generated Body… Is a garden… & a building* The body is a garden in the Song of Solomon 4:12, ‘A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse,’ and both a garden and a building in I Corinthians 3:9–16: ‘Ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building… know ye not that ye are the temple of God?’

P1. 27.2 *Luvah laid the foundation* & *Urizen finish’d it* Wars begin in hot passion and end in cold reasoning.

3–41 Most of this is from *FZ* IX. 136.16–137.4.

60\] Line deleted in copper in two copies.

P1. 28.3 Theseus in *A Midsummer Night’s Dream* v.i.16–17 remarks that the poet ‘gives to airy nothing/A local habitation and a name’. In the remainder of this plate, the craft of prophecy is described as a giving of form to unborn spectres, and to time itself.

21 *Theotormon* & *Sotha* Sons of Los, whose function is to catch the unborn spectres so that they can be given forms. The spectres, like small children, must be tempted or frightened into moving.

35–6 *like the black pebble… like the diamond* The rough diamond looks from the outside like a black pebble, but is beautiful within; so, too, mortal men.

P1. 29 This plate makes a final distinction between the visionary world created by Los, and the delusion and death of the vegetated world.

25–6 *Bowlahoola* & *Allamanda… Pulsation* The digestive, nervous and circulatory systems in men’s bodies.

30–31 *every Man… Orc* All men have an element of Revolt within them, which unites them; but on earth Revolt remains formless.

34 *Satan… Orc*… *Luvah* Luvah is Passion in Eternity, but only Rebellion in this world; furthermore, Rebellion in this world regularly produces a spectre of self-righteous Reaction.

35–6 *Accident being Formed… Demonstration* Empirical science treats ‘accident’ \(Matter\) as if it were ‘substance’ \(Spirit\). But to *see* existence this way is to *make* it so.

43 *Death to delude* In order to delude \(beguile\) Death.

57 *Horeb* The desert surrounding Mt Sinai.  
*Rephaim* ‘Valley of the shades of the dead’.

58 *Zelophehads Daughters* were five in number \(corresponding to the five senses\) and had no brothers. See 17.11 above.

65 *the Science of the Elohim* The knowledge or skill of the Elohim. This is a collective plural term for ‘God’, used in Genesis and elsewhere.



BOOK THE SECOND

The land of Beulah is described \(Pls. 30–31\). Ololon descends to Beulah. The sleeping Milton is instructed by his seven angels \(Pl. 32\). The songs of Beulah include God’s promise of redemption to the Female \(Pl. 33\). The songs welcome Ololon \(Pl. 34\). Ololon descends to Ulro and asks forgiveness of the Starry Eight \(Pl. 35\), who rejoice. Ololon continues the descent to Los and Enitharmon, and B. describes the wild thyme and the larks as messengers of Los at the crucial moment of Ololon’s appearance in female form in Blake’s garden \(Pls. 35–6\). Milton’s shadow condenses into the covering Cherub of all religious error \(Pl. 37\). Milton and Satan meet \(Pl. 38\). The Starry Seven appear with Milton in Blake’s garden, and call on Albion to wake \(Pl. 39\). Milton and Ololon meet and Milton at last declares his true vocation as a poet \(Pl. 41\). The six-fold female divides from Ololon and dives into Milton’s shadow; Ololon unites with the Starry Eight, and they appear as the Saviour \(Pl. 42\). Blake’s vision concludes as the Saviour prepares to enter Albion’s bosom, and the earth is prepared for the Last Judgement.

P1. 30 An inscription in mirror-writing around the words ‘Milton Book the Second’ reads ‘How wide the Gulf & Unpassable\! between Simplicity & Insipidity/Contraries are Positives/A Negation is not a Contrary’. Then the narrative picks up from 21.60: ‘Jesus the Saviour appeard coming in the Clouds of Ololon.’

Pl. 31.10–17 In Isaiah 63:9 the Saviour suffers with Mankind: ‘In all their affliction he was afflicted.’ Here, the idea is reversed: As the Saviour approaches with lamentation, all spheres of the creation respond sympathetically.

20 *Fairies, Nymphs, Gnomes, Genii* Folklore divinities, not high in the scale of the divine imagination. They belong to air \(Urizen\), water \(Tharmas\), earth \(Urthona\) and fire \(Luvah\).

24 *Element against Element, opposed in War* The natural warfare of the four elements is a staple of natural philosophy from Lucretius down to the seventeenth century.

49 *Og & Anak* Threat-figures. See 20.33n.

62 *sick with Love* From Song of Solomon 2:5: ‘Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.’

P1. 32\] This plate is a late addition.

1 *And Milton*… *Couch of Death* The narrative picks up from 15.1–7.

4 *My Spectre… my Emanation* The cruel ideology of courtship. See ‘My Spectre around me…’, Notebook, p. 494.

8 *Hillel… Lucifer* Lucifer \(‘morning star’\) is the first eye of God \(13.17\). In Isaiah 14:12, translated ‘Lucifer, son of the morning’, Lucifer is ‘Helel’. The Jewish Rabbi Hillel, who lived just before Christ, taught love of God and one’s brother, and hence was also a ‘morning star’.

10–22 The Seven Angels are ‘states’ or conditions which individuals may pass through \(as in common usage we speak of a ‘state’ of happiness or a ‘state’ of sin\). In the service of Divinity they are angels in human form. But in the service of Satan they are shapeless rocks, and their ‘holiness’ is that of ‘Length: Bredth & Highth’. Such ‘holiness’ can only admire itself, and thinks Imagination is a blasphemy against it. But these qualities \(length, breadth and height\) should obviously be Man’s servants, not his gods.

14 Not a correct Hebrew word, but a cross between *Kerabim* \(‘as multitudes’\) and *Cherubim.*

23 *States Change* Individuals may pass from one state to another, without losing their permanent individuality.

34–5 *Reason is a State… Created* One systematic philosophy wears out and is succeeded by another. But eternal forms – such as the prophet perceives – remain.

P1. 33.1–23 God’s song to Babylon – the Unholy City – as a jealous bride who has alienated her beloved. No people should set themselves up as the one Chosen People of God, denying his love to others. But even Babylon may be redeemed if she generously gives her handmaiden Jerusalem to her husband. This polygamous ideal of true love derives from several Old Testament stories in which wives give their handmaidens to their husbands. Oothoon offers such love in *VDA*, and Milton’s emanation is about to do the same.

16 *intirely abstracting… loves* Compare ‘Let us agree to give up Love,’ ‘My Spectre around me…’, Notebook, p. 494.

P1. 34 Ololon, who was a ‘Fiery Circle’ of Eternals in 20.43–50, is about to descend to Ulro, which is seen from above as a chaotic Polypus.

12–13 *Alla*… *Al-Ulro… Or-Ulro* These names are sub-classifications of the fallen world, which are never used again.

26 *Twenty-seven fold* For the twenty-seven evil Churches \(see 35.63–4 and Dictionary of Proper Names\) which encrust fallen Mankind.

27 *Five Females* Five senses; Zelophehad’s five daughters.

30 *The River Storge* A river of mortal birth. *Storge* is Gr. ‘parental affection’.

41 *Chasms of the Mundane Shell* Gaps left within the perimeters of the circles, when Man shrunk to his egg shape. See Diagram.

42 *Southward & by the East* Equally in the realms of Reason and Passion.

45 *Four Immortals* Four Zoas.

50 *They said* Ololon said.

50–52 *Wars of man… Interior Vision* Wars, which in Eternity are mental sport, are taken seriously by mortals.

P1. 35.7–13 *Female forms… the dark Woof* The females are Zelophehad’s five daughters \(17.11,27.58\) plus Rahab. The place-names are locations in the environs of London. The dark woof of the loom of Death opposes Enitharmon’s life-giving loom.

18–25 Immortals such as Ololon cannot see the City of Art until they descend to the material world, although those who dwell in the material world already can see it.

31–3 The crime of Ololon was to drive Milton into the Ulro.

42 *There is a Moment* The moment of inspiration in which an individual’s fragmentary understanding suddenly becomes integrated and unified. This is the crucial moment in which ‘the Poets Work is done’ \(29.1\). Here it is the moment in which Ololon, Los, Milton, and all the forces which oppose them, finally converge in Blake’s garden.

59 *Luvahs empty Tomb* associates Luvah with the crucified and risen Christ.

60 *Ololon*… *on the Rock* associates Ololon with the women who waited at Christ’s tomb.

63–4 *Twenty-seven churches* \(see Dictionary of Proper Names\) fill the firmament in concentric folds of increasing opacity. The SEVEN EYES OF GOD each preside over four Churches – but the count of Churches is incomplete \(should amount to twenty-eight, a more ‘perfect’ number\). The place of the twenty-eight, then, is taken by Truth in the form of Ololon \(and Jesus\) whom the twenty-eighth lark meets \(36.9–10\).

P1. 36.16–17 *One Female*… *a Virgin of twelve years* Ololon is now the embodiment of Milton’s lost emanation.

31–2 *my Shadow of Delight*… *is sick* Catherine Blake, who was often ill while at Felpham.

P1. 37.6–8 *Milton’s Shadow* becomes the condensation of his errors as a thinker, here identified with the COVERING CHERUB which keeps men expelled from Paradise and separated from God.

11 *the Wicker Man of Scandinavia* Caesar’s *Commentaries* mention a Druid form of human sacrifice, burning men within a huge wicker image.

15–18 Milton’s erroneous puritanism contains and implies all religious errors throughout history, including those that Milton himself denounced.

20–34 The twelve gods of Ulro are pagan deities, their names taken from Milton’s list in *Paradise Lost* 1.392–521.

50 *Og… Sihon* These lands, hostile to Israel, exist also among the stars.

54 *Forty-eight deformed Human Wonders* The constellations.

57–9 *none can pass… Entuthon Benython* The passage to Eternity is not through contemplation of the stars but through the labours of Prophecy.

P1. 38 The meeting of Milton and Satan is Milton’s final temptation.

10 *Milton within his sleeping Humanity* Milton has descended to this world, and so is asleep compared to his waking life in Eternity.

23–6 *Mystery Babylon… her Cup… her scarlet Veil* Within Satan is the Whore of Babylon, who in Revelation 17:4 has ‘a golden cup in her hand full of abominations’, and is ‘arrayed in purple and scarlet colour’.

28 *the Eastern porch* The gate of Passion.

29–32 Compare ‘The iron hand crushd the Tyrants head/And became a Tyrant in his stead,’ ‘The Grey Monk’, Pickering MS, p. 506 above. Milton’s triumph over temptation means renunciation of the self-righteous virtue exhibited in his literary and political careers.

50 *Satan*.… *Coming in a cloud* As does God over Mt Sinai.

52 *Fall therefore down & worship me* So Satan tempts Jesus in Luke 4:7, ‘If thou there fore wilt worship me, all shall be thine,’ and in *Paradise Regained* IV.166–7, ‘if thou wilt fall down/And worship me as thy superior Lord’.

P1. 39. 11 *Cast him… into the Lake* From Revelation 20:10: ‘And the devil… was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone.’

32 *Then Albion rose* B. describes Albion’s attempt to rise and walk in terms of place-names throughout Great Britain and in the City of London.

43–4 *York. Norwich* Cathedral cities of England. In *f* the theme of the cathedral cities as ‘Albion’s Friends’ is developed.

53 *Urizen faints* The narrative picks up from Pl. 19, the struggle between Milton and Urizen.

P1. 40.9 *those who contemn Religion* Those such as Milton who consciously oppose religious tyranny, yet unconsciously support it.

12 *Voltaire* & *Rousseau*… *Hume* & *Gibbon & Bolingbroke* all mocked Christianity and were felt by Blake to believe only in a ‘dead’ Newtonian universe.

17 *Rahab* Moral Virtue, of which Milton had approved. Moral Virtue is a two-fold monster because it promotes self-righteous War and because it hides suppressed Lust.

P1. 41.5 *Bacon, Locke & Newton* B.’s trinity of Reasoners.

25 *the Sexual Garments* The clothing of flesh worn by mortals.

27 *Which Jesus rent* The rending of the veil of the Temple when Jesus died \(Matthew 27:51\) and the old Law died with him.

28 *Generation… swallowd up in Regeneration* From Isaiah 25:7–8: ‘And he will destroy… the face of the covering cast over all people, and the veil that is spread over all nations. He will swallow up death in victory.’

P1. 42.3–6 *the Virgin divided… Miltons Shadow* Error splits from Truth and gives herself to annihilation with the shadow.

7 *a Moony Ark* The ark of Noah was shaped like a crescent moon.

18 *the Immortal Four* The Zoas, or the four cities named in *f* as Albion’s faithful friends: Verulam, London, York, Edinburgh.

28 *Shadow of Delight* Catherine Blake.

P1. 43.1 *the Great Harvest & Vintage of the Nations* Described in Revelation 14:14–20, and by B. in *FZ* IX. Pp. 131–5.



### ***Dedication to Blake’s Illustrations to Blair’s*** Grave



TO THE QUEEN

Dedication to the illustrations for Cromek’s edition of Blair’s *Grave* \(1808\), designed by B. and engraved by Schiavonetti.



### ***Notebook Epigrams and Satiric Verses***, c. ***1808–12***

Most of these pieces vent B.’s spleen against fools and foes in the world of art. After his return from Felpham B. was having difficulty making a living, felt himself surrounded by misunderstanding and malice, and believed that bad artists and bad principles of art were ruining the culture of England. See Bentley, *Blake Records*, 166–223 *passim.*

    His prose works of this period – including the Advertisement of his Exhibition \(15 May 1809\), his *Descriptive Catalogue* \(1809\), ‘Public Address’ \(*c.* 1810\) and *A Vision of the Last Judgment* \(1810\) – more fully enunciate his artistic theories and opinions on public taste, as do his Annotations *\(c.* 1808\) to the *Discourses on Art* of Sir Joshua Reynolds.



‘YOU DONT BELIEVE…’

11 *Only Believe Believe* & *try* A collation of Jesus’ words to Jairus, whose daughter had died, ‘Be not afraid, only believe’ \(Mark 5:36\), and the episode of Doubting Thomas \(John 20:24–9\). However, no-where in the Gospels does Jesus use the word ‘try’.



‘NO REAL STYLE OF COLOURING…’

3 *S’ Joshuas Colouring* Sir Joshua Reynolds \(1723–92\), President of the Royal Academy from 1769 to 1790. His *Discourses on Art* \(published 1798\) enraged Blake; see the verses written among B.’s marginalia, p. 632. As to ‘colouring’, B. disapproved of painting in oils, which he considered muddy and inclined to yellow. He also disapproved of emphasis on colouring, rather than firm drawing and outline in art.



‘AND HIS LEGS CARRIED IT…’

The opening of this poem is missing. It is written in a fair hand, then emended. The matters referred to are: 1. In 1803 B. was accused of sedition by Private John Scholfield, a dragoon whom he had ejected from his Felpham garden. His patron, Hayley, retained a lawyer, Samuel Rose, to defend him. B. was tried and acquitted January 1804. Rose died shortly afterwards. 2. In 1805, the publisher Cromek asked B. to design forty illustrations to Blair’s *Grave*, promised he could do half the engravings for this volume, then gave all the engraving work to the more fashionable Schiavonetti. Schiavonetti died in 1810, Cromek in 1812. 3. In 1806, Cromek took B.’s idea for a painting of Chaucer’s ‘Canterbury Pilgrims’ and suggested it to Stothard, who exhibited the ensuing work in 1807 – to B.’s fury. 4. In 1809 B. held an unsuccessful exhibition of his own paintings. *The Examiner*, edited by Leigh and Robert Hunt, called him ‘an unfortunate lunatic’.

In the present poem, the supposed speaker is Stothard \(‘Stewhard’\). The soul-stealer of the opening lines is Cromek \(called ‘Screwmuch’ in the closing lines\). ‘Yorkshire Jack Hemp’ and ‘daw’ are John and Ann Flaxman, by whom B. during this period did not feel sufficiently appreciated. ‘Felpham Billy’ is William Hayley. ‘Billy’s lawyer’ was Samuel Rose. ‘Cur’ and ‘Dady’ have not been identified. ‘Assassinetti’ is Schiavonetti. ‘Death’ is Blake himself.

17 *Hare* Puns on Hunt.  
*weakly* Puns on ‘weekly’.



‘WAS I ANGRY…’

4–5 *Flaxman, Cromek, Stothard, Schiavonetti* See note to previous poem.

6 *Macklin, Boydel, Bowyer* All had employed Blake as an engraver.



‘THE SUSSEX MEN ARE NOTED FOOLS…’

3 *H\[aines\] the painter* Blake and Samuel Haines both did illustrations for Boydell’s *Shakespeare* \(1802\) and Hayley’s *Romney* \(1809\).



TO H\[UNT\]

1 *Fuseli* B.’s artist-friend and supporter Henry Fuseli \(1741–1825\) was attacked along with Blake in Hunt’s *Examiner* in 1808 \(see Bentley, *Blake Records*, 195\).



‘HE IS A COCK WOULD…’

Private Cock supported the charge of sedition made against B. in 1803–4.

FLORENTINE INGRATITUDE

Sir Joshua Reynolds was elected in 1775 to the Florentine Academy, which required him to send a self-portrait.

15 *an English Fetch* An English trick.

26 *Ghiottos Circle or Appelles Line* Giotto \(1266–1377\), when asked to send Pope Benedict IX a sample of his work, drew a perfect circle freehand. Apelles \(4th century BC\) challenged Protogenes in drawing freehand straight lines.



A PITIFUL CASE

8 *Michael Angelo* Reynolds’s concluding words in the *Discourses* are in praise of Michael Angelo.



‘IF IT IS TRUE WHAT THE PROPHETS WRITE…’

5 *Bezaleel & Aholiab* The two master craftsmen who designed the Hebrew Tabernacle, its furnishings and ornaments \(Exodus 31:1–11, 35:30–35\).



‘P\[HILLIPS\] LOVED ME, NOT…’

Thomas Phillips did the portrait of B. for Cromek’s edition of Blair’s *Grave* \(see note to ‘And his legs carried it…’ above\).



ON H\[AYLE\]YS FRIENDSHIP

5 *act upon my wife* Did Hayley try to make Catherine influence her husband in the direction of greater conventionality?

6 *Hired a Villain* No evidence exists to connect Hayley with Schol-field, and Hayley did his best to support Blake through his sedition trial. Perhaps Blake considered Rose, the lawyer Hayley got to defend him, ‘a villain’. The line is from ‘Fair Elenor’, *PS*, p. 24 above.



‘COSWAY FRAZER & BALDWIN OF EGYPTS LAKE…’

Richard Cosway, a fashionable miniature painter and Swedenborgian;? Alexander Fraser, a painter \(who, however, came to London only in 1813\); George Baldwin, a traveller, mystic and one-time consul-general n Egypt.



‘I RUBENS…’

Peter Paul Rubens \(1577–1640\) was a sometime diplomat as well as prolific painter.

‘SWELLD LIMBS WITH NO OUTLINE…’



Rubens’s figures are consistently large and opulent.

4 *an hundred Journeymens how dye do* Many paintings issued from Rubens’s studio were executed mainly by assistants.



‘THE CRIPPLE EVERY STEP DRUDGES & LABOURS…’

6 *Newton* & *Bacon* B. uses the two great English scientists here as advocates of careful ‘labour’ in scientific experiment, hence approving ‘labour’ in an artistic cripple.

9 *high labourd* A term for a carefully finished and polished work of art.



ON THE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT GIVEN… DUCROWE & DILBURY DOODLE

Pierre Ducros \(1745–1810\) was a Swiss landscape artist. ‘Dilbury Doodle’ is a nonsense name; ‘doodle’ means simpleton, noodle; but as a verb means to fool, cheat.

5 *Colonel Wardle* Gwyllym Lloyd Wardle, soldier and Member of Parliament who assailed the Duke of York for corruption in 1809.

6 *a dose of Cawdle* Medicinal drink; but also: to lecture, harangue; and a ‘hempen caudle’ means hanging \(obs.\).



THE CUNNING SURES & THE AIM AT YOURS

‘Connoisseurs and amateurs’, a phrase from ‘Public Address’, p. 634.



‘ALL PICTURES THATS PANTED…’

‘Panted’ and ‘pant’ are presumably Cromekian mispronunciations; see also ‘English Encouragement of Art’ and ‘I ask’d my Dear Friend Orator Prigg…’, below.

ENGLISH ENCOURAGEMENT OF ART

A much-revised piece. B. added the subtitle and altered the language to burlesque Cromek’s speech. In the final reading:

2 *Menny wouver* Manoeuvre.

3 *a great Conquest are Bunglery* A great congress? corpus? are bunglers.

4 *Jenous looks to ham* Genius looks to them.

9–12 These lines may belong to the close of the following poem, but the sense suits this one.



‘WHEN YOU LOOK AT A PICTURE…’

4 *Jenny suck awa’* Je ne sais quoi.



‘I GIVE YOU THE END OF A GOLDEN STRING…’

Used in *f* Pl. 77 \(p. 797, below\) and entitled ‘To the Christians’.



WILLIAM COWPER ESQRE

The poet Cowper \(1731–1800\) was a religious enthusiast, and was subject to fits of depression and madness. B. accuses Hayley \(the name can be made out in the erased first stanza\) – who tried to help Cowper, and wrote his posthumous biography – of helping too late, and understanding too little. His own identification with Cowper is clear. Annotating Spurzheim’s *Observations on Insanity* \(1817\), he commented on the assertion that ‘religion is another fertile cause of insanity’, as follows: ‘Cowper came to me & said. O that I were insane always I will never rest. Can you not make me truly insane. I will never rest till I am so. O that in the bosom of God I was hid. You retain health and yet are as mad as any of us all – over us all – mad as a refuge from unbelief – from Bacon Newton & Locke.’

1–4\] The first stanza is an afterthought written over an erased original opening.

3 *Fuseli*… *both Turk* & *Jew* Fuseli was actually Swiss.



‘I WILL TELL YOU WHAT JOSEPH OF ARIMATHEA…’

Joseph of Arimathea, according to legend, brought the Holy Grail to Britain. B. sets him against the Roman scholar Pliny and the Roman Emperor Trajan.



TO VENETIAN ARTISTS

1 Newton did major work in optics and the phenomenon of colour.



BLAKES APOLOGY FOR HIS CATALOGUE

These verses exist in a much-revised first draft in Notebook, pp. 62–3, where they follow a passage in ‘Public Address’, and where the title and first couplet are squeezed in at the bottom. A fair copy is on p. 65. The present text follows the line-arrangement of the latter.

4 *Bartolloze* Francesco Bartollozi \(1727–1815\), a popular engraver who worked in a ‘soft’ style while B. continued to do old-fashioned ‘hard-line’ engraving.

7 *Dryden in Rhyme* Dryden’s rhymed closet-opera *The State of Innocence* \(1674\) was based on *Paradise Lost*, and Nat Lee’s prefatory poem praises Dryden as a refiner of Milton’s rough ore. B. comments: ‘Stupidity will prefer Dryden because it is in Rhyme and monotonous sing song sing song from beginning to end’ \(‘Public Address’\).

9 *Tom Cooke cut Hogarth down* The engraver Thomas Cook \(1744–1818\) created ‘Hogarth Restored’, laborious copies of Hogarth’s works, first in the same size as the originals, then reduced.



FROM CRATETOS

A literal translation of this epigram, ascribed to Crates of Thebes, is: ‘Time has bent me; though a skilled craftsman, yet he makes all things weaker.’



‘THE CAVERNS OF THE GRAVE…’

A poem for the Earl of Egremont’s wife, who had commissioned a painting of the Last Judgement, which B. completed in 1808. The opening lines refer to B.’s illustrations for Blair’s *Grave*, which he had dedicated to the Queen \(see p. 608 above\).



*Miscellaneous Verses and Epigrams*

VERSE FROM THE MARGINALIA TO REYNOLDS’S *DISCOURSES*

Blake commented lengthily and splenetically in his copy of the *Works* of Sir Joshua Reynolds, ed. Edmund Malone, 1798, and included several bits of verse. Some were written at B.’s first reading, others *c.* 1809–10 – the same period in which he was writing Notebook epigrams against Reynolds and other figures in the world of art.



ADVICE OF THE POPES

Written on the title page of Reynolds’s *Works*, with the comment: ‘This Man was Hired to Depress Art.’

‘SOME LOOK. TO SEE THE SWEET OUTLINES…’

Sardonic response to Reynolds’s admission that he did not at first appreciate Raphael.



‘WHEN FRANCE GOT FREE.…’

Malone in a footnote praises Reynolds’s disapproval of the French Revolution, and quotes Pope: ‘They led their wild desires to woods and caves,/And thought that all but SAVAGES were slaves.’



ON THE VENETIAN PAINTER

This and the next two pieces deal with painters such as Titian, whose ‘elegance’ Reynolds praises.



VERSE FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT TO BLAKE’S EXHIBITION OF PAINTINGS, 1809

An insertion in B.’s advertisement \(dated 15 May 1809\), following notice of one of his major paintings: ‘THE ANCIENT BRITONS – Three Ancient Britons overthrowing the Army of armed Romans; the Figures full as large as Life – From the Welch Triads’. The lines have been traced \(Damon, *Dictionary*, under ‘Welsh’\) to an item in the *Myvyrian Anthology* \(1801–7\) which tells of Arthur’s last battle against the Saxons. B.’s first stanza is an adaptation which alters Saxons to Romans, the second stanza is his own invention. The Welsh nationalist Owen Pugh, friend of the Blakes, may have shown him the poem.



EPIGRAMS FROM *A DESCRIPTIVE CATALOGUE* AND ‘PUBLIC ADDRESS’

Blake published the *Descriptive Catalogue* to accompany his unsuccessful exhibition of paintings in 1809. It is a polemical work which not only lists and describes the paintings for sale, but defends B.’s ideas and attacks his foes. The first epigram attacks Thomas Stothard, whose ‘reserve and modesty’ were praised in a prospectus for his rival painting of the Canterbury Pilgrims, and the second attacks Flaxman and Stothard together. Rhymed versions of both appear in the Notebook, pp. 618, 617.

    ‘Public Address’ \(an editorially given title\) consists of disconnected fragments of an essay on art and artists scattered through the Notebook. Again, B. attacks his foes and defends himself and his own principles as an artist. In addition to the two epigrams given here, there is a shorter version of ‘Blakes apology for his Catalogue’ \(see p. 627\).



*Jerusalem*

An illuminated book of 100 plates, including four full-page designs, known in five copies printed by Blake, and three printed posthumously. Although the 1804 title-page may indicate the beginning of composition, most of the poem was probably written between 1809 and 1815, and etched between 1815 and 1820. The arrangement of plates is uniform except for Chapter 2, in which the order of plates 29–46 varies in two copies.

    *Jerusalem*, Blake’s final epic poem, is his monumental equivalent of Milton’s *History of England.* Incorporating B ’s various earlier mythologies into a single self-consistent myth, it tells the story of the Fall of ALBION – who is Blake’s Mankind – from union with Jesus, the Divine Vision; Albion’s rejection of his EMANATION, JERUSALEM, and his seduction by the lower female principle of VALA; the labours of the prophet LOS – who embodies man’s visionary and creative powers – to save him from the violent and cruel nightmare of his ensuing history; and his final regeneration and reunion with Jesus.

    *Jerusalem* is more complicated in its personages and actions than any of B.’s other works, in part because it is an ‘intellectual allegory’ in the Dantean sense of pursuing several different levels or types of meaning simultaneously. Among these are:

    1. Historical-geographical. Albion is both a giant man who incorporates all men from the beginning to the end of time, and a place. In Eternity, Albion contained all nations within himself. In his fall, the nations separate into mere physical geographical locations. Most tragically, the lands of the Bible become separated from those of Great Britain. This gives B. several significant sub-themes.

    \(a\) Place-names within and around London and throughout Great Britain become loci for much of the poem’s action, and are sometimes personified. In an important episode of Chapter 2, the cathedral cities of Great Britain become ‘Friends’ who try to aid him, but fail.

    \(b\) A system of correspondences exists between British and biblical locales. For example, Tyburn Hill equals Calvary, Lambeth equals Bethlehem, mountains in Derbyshire are identified with mountains in the Holy Land, and the counties of England, Scotland and Wales are identified with the regions belonging to the twelve tribes of Israel.

    \(c\) The history handed down to us by the Old and New Testaments is really Albion’s history. The Patriarchs are identified with the DRUIDS, who according to Blake worshipped nature and practised human sacrifice. The conquest of Canaan by the twelve tribes means a binding of man to material nature, and a confirmation of self-righteous moral law. The apostasy of the secessionist northern kingdom of Israel, whose capital was Tirzah, corresponds to Albion’s further plunge into materialism. And the sufferings of Jerusalem, culminating in Babylonian captivity, reflect Great Britain’s stubborn rejection of the Divine Vision.

    \(d\) Albion has TWELVE SONS and TWELVE DAUGHTERS, corresponding to the twelve tribes of Israel. They enact the *secular* history of Britain, as the tribes enact *religious* history. The Sons \(sometimes called Spectres\) are motivated by rationalism and militarism, and have names taken from Blake’s personal enemies. The Daughters \(their Emanations\) have names of queens and princesses in British legend, and personify Female Will. These groups are:

Hyle

Cambel-Boadicea

Hand

Gwendolen

Coban

Ignoge

Gwantok

Cordella

Peachey

Mehetabel

Brereton

Ragan

Slayd

Gonorill

Hutton

Gwinefred

Skofield

Gwineverra

Kox

Estrild

Kotope

Sabrina

Bowen

    2. Religious-sexual. Religious and sexual symbols are closely associated throughout B.’s work, from the short lyrics ‘The Garden of Love’ and ‘I saw a chapel all of gold…’ onwards. In *f* Mankind’s lapse into false religion continues to be presented in terms of dominance by females.

    The ‘body’ of the faithful is to Blake a human body, in which male and female are one, and both are one in Jesus. All historical Churches and religions form impediments to such union. Instead of uniting Man and God, they divide them. All restrictions on human sexuality, too, form barriers. For sexual impulses, however ‘sinful’, must be expressed to be transcended. To show the identity of these issues, Blake presents temples and tabernacles, arks, veils and guardian cherubim – all that is ‘secret’, ‘sacred’, ‘holy’ and untouchable – through imagery of a chaste feminine body. As the veil of the temple was rent when Jesus died, so must organized religion, and the moral laws it enforces, fall before the higher union of man, woman and God.

    \(b\) Like the author of Revelation, Blake sees Jerusalem as both a city and a woman who is the bride of Jesus. But at the outset of the poem, Albion jealously refuses to give Jerusalem to Jesus, moralistically rejects her as sinful and allows her to be cast out by his sons and daughters. Further, he allows himself to be seduced by Vala, Jerusalem’s ‘shadow’. Vala is the seductive goddess of Nature \(of whom the sub-manifestations RAHAB and TIRZAH are, respectively, the Whore and the Virgin\), and she is also the unholy city, Babylon. Worship or ‘love’ of Vala is what Blake calls ‘Natural Religion’. It means division between man and God, submission to corporeal limitations, allegiance to the kingdoms of this world and devotion to war and human sacrifice.

    \(c\) Blake posits a succession of twenty-seven churches in man’s history, and describes them as combinations of male and female principles, such that the first third are ‘hermaphroditic’, the second third ‘male within female’, the last group ‘female within male’.

    3. Political. The specifically political portions of *Jerusalem* are those connected with LUVAH. As in earlier works, Luvah is the Zoa of Passion within Albion; he is also France. Rejection and sacrifice of Luvah means both suppression of domestic radicalism and hostility towards revolution abroad. The theme of vengeance enacted against Luvah treats the Napoleonic wars, and embodies Blake’s plea that even an offensive nation should not be punished but forgiven. Beyond these episodes, however, we are to remember that Jerusalem is named ‘Liberty’, and that throughout the poem rejection of her means rejection of political liberty as well as of sexual and spiritual fulfilment.

    4. Psychological. The fallen Albion may be seen as an individual human being in a condition of mental illness, variously described as asleep, diseased or dead. By renouncing Jesus and Jerusalem, he renounces his own humanity. His sleep is the sleep of Reason – a barren rationalism which demands physical demonstration, and causes doubt and despair. His disease is the disease of Moral Virtue which sets up laws of purity, demands righteousness and punishes the sinful. Devoured by his own selfhood, he is dead to the promise of salvation. Until he wakes from his sleep in Chapter 4, he is portrayed as tortured but stubborn in his errors, and dominated by his rational spectre, the *femme fatale* Vala and the cruel Sons and Daughters who express his selfishness. He is – the reader must understand – each of us, as we live in this world.

    5. Visionary. The prophet LOS, throughout *Jerusalem*, strives to build GOLGONOOZA, a ‘fourfold’ city of art or imagination which is simultaneously a human body. Working within ULRO – the hell of a material world or of a material body – he and his sons labour perpetually at his furnaces, while his female counterpart ENITHARMON labours with her daughters at their looms, giving permanent form to all things on earth. His one desire is to save Albion, who is unaware of his existence. He must also struggle against his own Spectre – all the forces within the artist which urge him against creativity – and force the Spectre to work with him. Finally, he must persist despite the rebellion of his Emanation, who is both female counterpart and muse. Although Blake speaks in his own voice on occasion, Los is certainly a projection of his character, desires and struggles as an artist. Los, keeper of the Divine Vision throughout the ‘time of troubles’ which we call human history, is the hero of the poem; in the finale, however, he disappears, having been re-absorbed into the fulfilled Albion.

CHAPTER I

This opening chapter, prefaced with an address ‘To the Public’, presents the issues of the poem in the relatively simple terms of unity *v.* division, love *v.* jealousy, faith *v.* despair, forgiveness *v.* accusation. At the outset, Albion rejects the love of the Saviour, and hides Jerusalem from his ‘vision and fruition’. The rest of the chapter has two major movements, one showing the internal struggles of Los \(and Blake\) to maintain hope, the other showing the decline of Albion to a state of despair. At the centre of the chapter is a vision of Golgonooza. The sections are as follows: Pl. 4: The Saviour rejected by Albion. Pl. 5: Blake announces his ‘great task’, and sees the ‘starry wheels’ of mechanical Reason, driven by the sons of Albion, drawing Jerusalem eastwards into non-entity. Pls. 6 – 11: A long dialogue between Los and his Spectre. Los forces the reluctant Spectre to labour at the furnaces. Erin comes forth from the furnaces with the Daughters of Beulah and the Sons and Daughters of Los, and all commiserate over the sufferings of Jerusalem.

    Pls. 12–14: Vision of Golgonooza.

P1. 15: Blake sees the sleeping Albion, the present state of Europe, and the original division of the twelve tribes from Albion. Pl. 16: The geographical labours of Los and his sons. Pl. 17: Los communes with himself concerning female temptation and love.

P1s. 18–19: The Sons of Albion denounce Jerusalem, and their starry wheels rend Albion’s loins.

P1s. 20–24: Dialogue of Albion, Jerusalem and Vala, concludes in Albion’s despair.

P1. 25: Beulah laments over Albion.

P1. 3.3 *Giants & Fairies* Epic and lyric poems.

28–9 *Sinais.… art of writing* A tradition that phonetic writing began with Moses.

36–58 The first free-verse manifesto in English. It is modelled on Milton’s prefatory note to *Paradise Lost* justifying blank verse.

40–41 *Eδοθη… Ä π⍳ γη* ‘All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.’ B.’s argument is that the power of the poet derives ultimately from Jesus.

43–5 *Monotonous Cadence… derived from… Rhyming* Sense unclear. An extension of rhyming? Liberated from rhyming? ‘The modern bondage of Rhyming’ is Milton’s phrase.

P1. 4 *Movos* ó *Iεsous* In John 8:9 ‘only Jesus’ remains with the woman found in adultery, when her accusers depart. In Luke 9:36 the slightly different phrase ‘ó Iεçouç\!¿ovoç’ gives us ‘Jesus alone’ at the Transfiguration, after the vision and cloud vanish. Both passages have application to the theme of *Jerusalem.*

6 *Awake*… O *sleeper* Jesus addresses Albion, who is both England and Mankind.

14 In Proverbs 8:30 ‘Wisdom’ is co-eternal with God, ‘and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him’.

17 *the vision and fruition of the Holy-one* The phrase implies mutual perceiving and sexual union or birth-giving between Jerusalem and her Saviour. Jealous Albion, because he will not accept the Saviour as one with himself but sees him as a rival, has cut off this union.

18 *I am not a God afar off* In Deuteronomy 30:11–13 the commandment of God ‘is not hidden… neither is it far off… But the word is very nigh to thee’.

29 Albion’s reply to the Saviour echoes Pharaoh in Ezekiel 29:3: ‘My river is mine own and I have made it for myself.’

30 *Malvern, Cheviot, Plinlimmon, Snowdon* Mountains in England and Wales.

P1. 5.1–15 Albion’s jealous dissembling means psychic disintegration. His parts are randomly scattered, given up to conflict, and shrunken, while his emanation is sacrificed.

3 *Cambridge & Oxford & London* Albion’s seats of imaginative leadership are lost in the errors of rationalist philosophy; their ‘starry Wheels’ \(1. 4\) represent the dead Newtonian universe. These wheels, which become a major negative symbol, are driven – we soon discover – by the Sons of Albion.

16 *Trembling I sit* Blake speaks of his task as a poet. The following passage introducesGOLGONOOZA and the furnace of Los, set against the destructiveSONS and DAUGHTERS OF ALBION.

25–7 *Hand…*.… *Bowen* See ALBION, SONS OF.

31–2 *Southward… Northward… time after time* See *Milton* 26.13n. The northern entrance is for mortals, the southern for immortals. The Sons of Albion are representative immortals who are recurrently born into history, as on a wheel.

34 *Male*… *Furnace; Female… loom* The Sons and Daughters of Albion represent destructive furnace and loom, opposed to the creative furnace and loom of Los and Enitharmon.

39 *they controll our Vegetative powers* The Daughters of Albion control our mortal life-cycle. Their names are listed in ll. 40–45.

46–53 Newtonian starry wheels, turning in vacuum, create a draught which disperses JERUSALEM and VALA in smoke rising from the chimneys of Los’s furnaces. The idea is that Error is a vacuum which sucks in Truth: ‘Mighty was the draught of Voidness to draw Existence in’ *\(FZII.23. 18*\).

P1. 5.66-Pl. 6.2 Los’s SPECTRE\(masculine\) and EMANATION\(feminine\) divide from him. A ‘Spectre’ in B. is the purely male portion of a divided personality. It may be identified with mechanical ‘reasoning power’, with self-preservation instinct or with physical potency. In itself, it is pathological – caring only for survival at all costs – yet it is a powerful ally. In *f* Los forces his reluctant spectre to labour with him at the furnaces.

P1. 7.2 *He stood over the Immortal* Los’s Spectre stood over Los. His following speech is an attempt to discourage Los-Blake’s creativity.

11 *He drinks thee up* The Spectre charges that Albion exploits and scorns Los, who is dedicated to saving him \(England does not appreciate B.’s art\).

14 *thy stolen Emanation* May refer to B.’s quarrel with Stothard over the ‘Canterbury Pilgrims’ \(1806\).

18–25 *Hand has peopled Babel… Schofield is Adam* Albion’s cruel sons are the powers behind the patriarchs, from Adam, to the flood, to the first established monarchy. The biblical lineage goes as follows: *Adam* is seven generations from *Enoch.* Enoch is the great-grandfather of *Noah.* Noah’s sons are *Shem, Ham* and *fapheth*, his grandsons include *Cush, Ashur* and *Aram. Nimrod* is his great-grandson, and the first King. *Babel* and *Ninevah* were early post-deluvian cities.

30–37 A re-telling of *FZ* 11.25.40–27.20, the sufferings of Passion in the fires of Nature.

38–41 *Luvah*… *Forming the Spectres of Albion* The Spectre of Los, lost in paranoia by this time, mistakenly thinks the suffering Luvah is a foe. Hence Los’s reply ‘I know not this.’

P1. 8.2 *Ranelagh, Strumbolo, Crommells gardens* Places of public entertainment. *Chelsea Hospital* was for wounded soldiers.

32 *Uncircumcised pretences to Chastity* Circumcision in B. means re-linquishment of selfhood.

P1. 9.17–28 *I took the sighs… tears flow down* All the injustices of this world, just catalogued, are formed by Los into \(tragic, indignant\) Art.

Pl. 10\] An added plate.

P1. 10.8 *Two Contraries* See *MHH, passim.* All reality is organized into contraries, and the contraries are equally valid. But the Sons of Albion reduce everything to dead moralistic abstraction.

37–8 *thy Sins/That thou callest thy Children* The creative acts of Los, the prophets and visionaries throughout history, are called sins.

P1. 11.8 *Then Erin came forth* Erin \(Ireland\) is a figure of faith and hope for liberty throughout *J.*

19–20 *Sobrina \(& Ignoge*… *light and love* An ironic image.

22 *mandrake… before Reubens gate* Mandrakes were supposed to make those who ate them sexually desirable. Reuben’s mandrakes were a source of jealous contention between his mother Leah, and Rachel, Jacob’s other wife \(Genesis 30\).

24–5 To the children of Los, anything in Nature is but a reflection of Eternity.

P1. 12.1 *Why wilt thou give to her a Body* Los answers this question in 1.13: all falsehoods must be given bodies – must be fully realized and encountered in order to be disproved.

5 *the finger of God* God’s finger will touch the seventh furnace which is the seventh eye of God – Jesus – as in *FZ* VIII.

7 *I feel my Emanation also dividing* The division of Enitharmon from Los is not occurring for the first time just now; it is co-incident with the initial Fall and is a fact throughout the history of lapsed mankind. Los ‘feels’ his pain afresh, as if it were new – a sign of his strong memory of Eternity and desire for wholeness.

14 *Appollyon* \(Gr., ‘destroyer’.\) A tormenting angel of the bottomless pit in Revelation 9:11; and the ‘foul fiend’ whose reasons and darts Christian meets and overcomes in the Valley of Humiliation in *Pilgrim’s Progress.*

16 *Such were the lamentations* The lamentations are in fact full of hope.

P1. 12.25-Pl. 13.29 The City of Golgonooza is described, parallel to the description of the Temple in Ezekiel 40–43 and of new Jerusalem in Revelation 21.

P1. 12.26 *Ethinthus* A vague ‘Queen of Waters’ in *Europe. Tyburn* The site of the gallows in London.

28 *Paddington* A slum district, adjacent to Tyburn. The sense is that of the Beatitudes. Can it be, B. asks, that blessed are the poor in spirit, and they that mourn, and they that are persecuted? Do we see the Kingdom of Heaven being built for them?

43–4 *Jerusalem wanders… among the dark Satanic wheels* Jerusalem was dispersed among the Starry Wheels \(a rational universe of Newtonian vacuity\) in 5.46–53.

45 *fourfold* Four and its multiples represent human perfection in B. \(Four Zoas, four directions of the compass, four elements, four worlds of Eden, Beulah, Generation, Ulro, and ‘fourfold vision’ as the highest possible to attain.\) To visualize Golgonooza one would need four dimensions, as one also needs to describe the infinite yet closed universe of post-Einsteinian cosmology.

54–60 The correspondences are:

West – Tongue – Circumference

Eden

South – Eyes – Zenith

Beulah

East – Nostrils – Centre

Ulro

North – Ear – Nadir

Generation

58 *Ezekiel… by Chebars flood* Ezekiel \(1:1–14\) saw ‘visions of God’ beginning with ‘the likeness of four living creatures… they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings… Their wings were joined… they went every one straight forward… they… had the face of a man… a lion… an ox… an eagle.’

P1. 13.22–3 *but the third Gate… threefold curtain* Three and its multiples always represent imperfection or incompleteness in B. The curtain here suggests the veil of sexuality.

26–9 *sixty-four thousand* 43 = 64, a perfect number; multiplication by 1000 implies merely ‘a great multitude’.

     *Genii, Gnomes, Nymphs, Fairies* These are elemental servants of the Four Zoas.

32 *Twenty-seven Heavens* A vision of the celestial firmament as twenty-seven concentric spheres of religious error within the *Mundane Shell* \(the sky\). See *M* 37.35, and Dictionary of Proper Names.

36 *And there it meets Eternity again* ‘Eternity’ exists in the furthest reaches beyond ourselves, and in the furthest reaches within ourselves: the two are one.

56 *the City of Golgonooza, & its smaller Cities* The ‘suburbs’ of Golgonooza include all the spiritual enemies of Israel. Art must include and express the doctrines even of its foes, in order to give Error a body.

P1. 14.2–10 Los sees the COVERING CHERUB which guards the tree of life, and the fallen forms of the other three Zoas: ORC \(fallen Luvah\) as serpent, URIZEN as dragon, THARMAS as false tongue; and their lost emanations, as well as his own, ENITHARMON.

19–24 The *gates* in *loins, heart* and *head* are ‘doors of perception’ as in *MHH* Pl. 14, p. 187 above.

26 *the western gate… is clos’d* As is the western gate of Golgonooza which faces Eden.

34\] Concluding line originally followed by: ‘End of the ist Chap:’; later deleted.

P1. 15.5 *such is my awful Vision* Blake now enters the poem and speaks personally. What Los sees, he sees. There follows an analysis of the present state of Europe.

18–20 *wheel without wheel* An emblem of Machinery, opposed to the *Wheel within Wheel* emblem of Vision \(as in Ezekiel’s ‘wheel in the middle of a wheel’ belonging to the ‘four living creatures’\).

22 *the Four Sons of Los* Rintrah, Palambron, Theotormon, Bromion.

24–9 In Eternity, Albion and Israel are one. In our world, they are geographically divided. Abram, twelve generations after Noah, entered into covenant with God, left his native Chaldea, was re-named Abraham, ‘father of many nations’, and given Canaan as the promised land for his seed When the covenant is renewed after the exile in Egypt, Reuben, Jacob-Israel’s eldest son, representing all twelve sons, settles in Canaan. This settlement in ‘a little & dark Land’ *\(FZ* 11.25.24\) is simultaneously a curse and a blessing: it perpetuates division \(between the chosen people and the rest of Mankind\) yet is the fulfilment of prophecy, and so is part of the redeeming labours of Los’s sons.

34 *the Valley of the Son of Hinnom* Place just outside Jerusalem where children were supposedly sacrificed by fire \(2 Chronicles 28:3, 33:6; Jeremiah 7:31–2\). Los’s redemptive work goes on even here.

P1. 16.1–27 The sons of Los, Bromion, Theotormon, Palambron, Rintrah, labouring in London’s suburbs, London itself, and throughout England.

28–60 A catalogue of correspondences between the counties of Great Britain and the lands of the twelve tribes of Israel, established when Mankind was divided.

P1. 17.6–15 Probably personal: Blake can contend with male opposition, but against female temptation he must harden his heart and act brutally, or he will become softened and unfit for work. He therefore responds to flirtation with open lust, and the ladies then take refuge in seeming chastity. Compare the brutality of Tamburlaine to the four virgins of Egypt who sue for pity *\(Tamburlaine the Great* v.i.64–190\), and the association of this with his poetic love for Zenocrate like that of Los–Blake for Enitharmon–Catherine.

22 *Tormented with sweet desire* Los–Blake admits that he is tempted, but knows the temptresses cannot really love him, since they hate his inspiration–wife. Vala likewise tempts Albion, Pls. 20–23.

33 *Negations are not Contraries* Los–Blake now turns on his spectre, calls it a mere negation and warns it against vainglorious ambition. This is a necessary warning because the spectre is so useful to Los.

51–6 The division of Enitharmon in a globe of blood is from *BU* v. The separation of his spectre from his back is in *Milton* 3.34–6.

59 *Go thou to Skofield… Bath… Canterbury* Ask the Accuser if he is a physical or spiritual healer. Bath and Canterbury are developed Pls. 41–6.

P1. 18 The hateful conclave of Albion’s sons rejects Jerusalem–Liberty.

P1. 18.2 *Outside* Outside of reality. This term always means ‘void’ in Blake. Eternity is always ‘within’ and makes true definite forms defined by an ‘outline of identity’. The Outside meets itself four-dimensionally here, as Eternity meets itself in 13.35–6.

8 *Three Immense Wheels* The twelve Sons of Albion group themselves as Accuser, Judge, Executioner, against Jerusalem.

26 *the Perfect*: Albion’s sons justify the morally ‘pure’ or ‘good’, called ‘Angels’ in *MHH* and ‘Elect’ in *Milton.*

30 *She is our Mother\! Nature\!* Vala, Nature, is not in fact their real mother. ‘Sinful Jerusalem’ is, but they disown her.

32 *the Potters field* A burial place for paupers and criminals.

33 *Her little-ones* implies vessels of Christ: ‘Whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.’ \(Matthew 18:5–6; see also Mark 9:42, Luke 17:2.\)

39 *Hand… absorb’d Albions Twelve Sons* The rational man leads the rest.

P1. 19.1–14\] Repe ated almost unchanged from *FZ* lx.119.33–120.3.

16 *His Eon* His emanation.

17–20 *his Sons… Spectres of the Twentyfour* Albion’s sons are spectres of his twenty-four ‘friends’ \(the cathedral cities of Pl. 36ff.\).

36 Albion’s heart was hardened against his friends \(1. 30\), thanks to his sons. Resisting help, he grows solid \(clos’d\) and opaque \(darkning\).

41–2 *Vala/The Lilly of Havilah* Pure and sterile beauty. ‘Havilah’ means ‘sand’.

P1. 20.5 *Wherefore hast thou shut me* Jerusalem addresses Albion, but is answered instead by Vala.

11 *Vala replied* The reply appears sympathetic, but implies that Jerusalem has deserved her present exile.

21 *Jerusalem answer’d* Jerusalem understands the implied accusation and replies that the answer to ‘Sin ‘is love and forgiveness. She reminds Vala also of the mutual former love among herself, Vala and Albion.

36 *Albion lov ‘d thee\! he rent thy Veil\!* Sexually, Albion took Vala’s virginity. Spiritually, he destroyed the barrier to the Holy of Holies, thus making possible access to God. The rending of the veil of the Temple at the death of Jesus signified the New Dispensation, ending the Dispensation of Law.

P1. 21 Deluded Albion takes on the role of Job, revels in his suffering and blames all on female lack of chastity.

P1. 22 Vala claims that she has suffered under accusations of sin \(Albion’s sons\) and been saved only by war \(Nimrod\). Albion too, she says, is secretly sinful.

P1. 22.19 *Then spoke Jerusalem* Jerusalem alone does not share Albion’s and Vala’s obsession with sin and accusation.

Pl. 23 Albion, in a frenzy of accusation and self-accusation, collapses.

P1. 23.5 *Hast thou again… Vala* Jerusalem’s sustained love, which is still willing to offer Vala to Albion without jealousy, is her re-knitting of Vala’s veil. To Albion this is sinful.

7 *O wretched Father\!* Albion in self-pity addresses himself.

20 *he bore the Veil whole away* Instead of rending the veil, Albion maintains it as a trap for mortal souls \(1. 23\) and a shroud for himself \(1. 35\).

26 *These were his last words* Albion’s final monologue parallels Satan’s introspective soliloquy on Mt Niphates \(*Paradise Lost* IV.32–113\). Like Satan, Albion convinces himself of his own turpitude and distance from God.

P1. 24.3 *Two bleeding Contraries* Contraries such as ‘good and ‘evil’are necessary for life \(see *MHH* Pl. 3\). But these contraries have been wounded by Albion’s ‘Reasoning Negation’, thanks to the destructive work of Albion’s sons, 10.8.

4–7 *We reared mighty Stones… Shame siezd us* A primitive Druid rite ends in shame at nakedness, like that of the fallen Adam and Eve.

17–50 *O Jerusalem Jerusalem*… *were there* Albion temporarily remembers his true union with Jerusalem, when even the arch-foe Babylon paid homage to her, and all nations were one in Jesus.

52 *Yet why these smitings of Luvah* Luvah has smitten Albion with boils \(21.4, 43.64\) like those of Job.

53–4 *O Lamb of God/Thou art a delusion* Albion retracts his repentance in doubt.

57–9 *Dost thou appear… merciful upon me* The Lamb suddenly appears to Albion, as God does to Marlowe’s Faustus *in extremis.* The cry of Faustus is \(‘v.ii.191\)‘My God, my God, look not so fierce on me\!’ Albion paradoxically is *refusing* salvation.

P1. 25.8 *not one sparrow can suffer* ‘Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father’ \(Matthew 10:29\).

13 *the Creation of States & the deliverance of Individuals* The doctrine of States –B.’s means of loving the sinner while hating the sin–is explained in *M* 32.10–32 and *f* 49.65–75. A state such as the ‘state of sin’ may be merely occupied temporarily by an individual. 

CHAPTER 2

This chapter, prefaced by an address ‘To the Jews’, focuses on the opposition between Moral Virtue, which is seen as a disease, and Mercy. As narrative, it pursues the decline of Albion into righteousness and vengeance, but promises ultimate deliverance in the Saviour. The episodes are as follows:

P1s. 28–30: Albion establishes Sin, Moral Virtue and the Law of God. His rejection of Humanity is confirmed by his spectre and by Vala’s domination over him.

P1s. 30–32: The conquest of the Holy Land by the twelve tribes of Israel \(represented by Reuben\) takes place. The ‘binding down’ of Reuben’s senses to earth and materialism also affects the gentile nations, the sons of Albion and the Zoas, all of whom degenerate. But the Divine Hand establishes limits to this decline.

P1s. 33–42: Albion is pursued and exhorted to awake by Los, the Divine Family, the Friends \(his cathedral cities\) and the Zoas. But he rejects all help and falls into non-entity. The Friends are infected by Albion’s disease; Los alone remains as watchman.

P1s. 43–4: The promise of the Divine Vision; the tale of Albion’s original fall; the prayer of Los.

P1s. 45–8: Los as watchman explores Albion’s interior. He sees Man’s sufferings, Vala condemning Jerusalem and glorifying War, the defiant sons of Albion building Druid temples, and the vengeful strife of Albion against Luvah. Albion repeats his last words \(of Pl. 24\), ‘Hope is banish’d from me,’ but the Saviour places him upon the Rock of Ages and builds for him the couch of the scriptures.

P1s. 48–50: Erin creates a protective space for Jerusalem. Communing with the Daughters of Beulah, she laments Man’s degeneration to materialism and promises regeneration.

P1. 27.2–3 *Was Britain the Primitive Seat*…? A number of eighteenth-century antiquarians argued that the Druids of Britain were actually the Patriarchs of the Old Testament.

17 *You have a tradition* The Cabbalistic tradition of Adam Kadmon \(lit. ‘Ancient Man’\) whom B. identifies with Albion.

25 *the Elohim* The name of God in Genesis 1.

41–3 The direction of Jerusalem’s fall is eastwards from London \(as in f5.48\) towards Palestine.

77–8 B. denounces the doctrine of a chosen people as selfish and Satanic.

P1. 28 Albion establishes Sin, Moral Virtue and the Law of God.

P1. 28.15 *A deadly Tree* See TREE OF MYSTERY.

21–2 *Albion began to erect*.… *rocks* An altar of unhewn stones inscribed with the Law is raised in Joshua 8:30–32.

P1. 29\] Pls. 29–46 are found in two arrangements. The present sequence follows that of copies \[a, c, f\] bracketed numbers indicate the order of copies \[d, e\].

P1. 29.7 The gourd in Jonah 4:10‘came up in a night, and perished in a night’.

26–7 *Albions Emanation*…*Appeard* The ‘appearance’ is Vala, not Jerusalem, and Albion now worships Vala.

P1. 29.36-Pl. 30.1 Vala’s memory of Eternity and her assertions about the present are equally delusive. She exalts her past position falsely, indulges in unjustified self-pity for her ‘love’ of Jerusalem and wrongly but seductively claims that Beauty is superior to Brotherhood.

P1. 30.2–16 The awesomeness of Vala’s beauty has emasculated Albion, though in part against his better judgement.

3–4 *milky fear\!/A dewy garment* The ejaculation and perspiration of Albion’s sexual dream.

10 *why have thou elevate inward* Why have you usurped a position which you should not have?

15 *they neither marry nor are given in marriage* Quotes Matthew 22:30. In B.’s Eternity, humanity is not separated into sexes, and so has no need of marriage.

27–8 *There is a Throne*… *her own* The doctrine is from 1 Corinthians 11:3–9: ‘But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man… Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.’ Vala has destroyed this order.

36 Hand is the leader of Albion’s sons; Reuben, called ‘unstable as water’ \(Genesis 49:3\), the eldest of the sons of Israel. The following passage concerns the settlement of the Promised Land \(from Joshua 13–21\) , which Los–Blake deplores. Los from *Mam-Tor*, a hill in Derbyshire, sees Reuben in *Bashan*, a territory east of the river Jordan. \(Reuben, Gad and Manesseh were given lands east of the Jordan.\) *Succoth* and *Zaretan* are cities east and west of the Jordan. *Bohan* is a boundary stone.

46 *the Daughters of Albion divided Luvah* This story does not occur elsewhere and is never developed.

47 *Los bended his Nostrils down* Reuben, as he gains earthly territory, loses his perceptive powers. His eyes, tongue, ears follow \(Pl. 32\). In each case Reuben’s limited perceptions also affect the Gentile nations.

58 *Consider Sexual Organization* Sexual organization – any organism in the state of Generation–is by nature limited.

P1.31 An interruption in the story. The Saviour establishes limits to Albion’s fall, and promises ultimate deliverance.

P1. 31.1 *the Two Limits, Satan and Adam* The lower limits of Opacity and Contraction in Mankind’s collapse.

11 *No individual can keep these Laws* Albion’s promulgation of Law was the opening act of Chapter 2 \(Pl. 28\).

13 *Albion hath enterd the State Satan\!* Albion has become–for the time being– ‘Satanic’; that is, as mentally opaque as it is possible to be. The doctrine of States is examined *M* 32.10–38, *f* 49.65–75. A State may be accursed; an individual cannot be.

P1. 32 The story of the settlement of the Promised Land continues.

P1. 32.10 *Heshbon… Moab* These lands border the territory assigned to Reuben, on the north and south.

12 *Mount Gilead… Gilgal* Reuben faces the Promised Land from

the east.

14 *The Seven Nations* The Gentiles.

25–42 Cosmic disruption within and around Albion accompanies the foregoing appropriation of territory by the tribes of Israel. The Zoas sink into lower material forms: Urizen–air–fairies; Luvah–fire–genies; Tharmas–water–nymphs; Urthona–earth–gnomes.

29 *Urizen… East, Luvah…*. *South* They reverse their proper stations.

34\] Conjectural reading of deeply gouged deletion \(Erdman\).

39 *The Atlantic Continent* Fabled Atlantis, sunk beneath the Atlantic ocean in the Flood; a myth employed also in *America.*

41 *Reuben is Merlin* Reuben, like Merlin, was led astray by a woman.

P1.–33.I\] Line added by engraving on the etched plate.

10 *blue death*\] Mended in all copies from *pale* death, to suggest that Albion is Druidic; but ‘pale’ is restored in one copy.

P1. 34.29 *I behold London* Here begins the evocation of Albion’s Friends, his cities in human form, who guard and try to help him. This treatment of geography contrasts with the dehumanizing conquest and partition of the Promised Land in the preceding episode. The Friends \(listed in 36.47–61, 41.1–19\) are the twenty-seven cathedral cities of England, plus Edinburgh. London, Verulam–Canterbury, York and Edinburgh are chief’guardian cities’. In effect, as centres of moral leadership, the cities constitute Albion’s conscience.

55–6 The Gate of Luban, limit of Los’s redeeming power, invisible to mortal men. Just outside this gate is the threat of Eternal Death \(35.8\), equated with the system of Moral Virtue \(35.10\). Albion, fleeing his would-be saviours, enters this gate \(35.11\).

P1. 35.12–13 *Los… In Cambridgeshire.… is the twenty-eighth* Cambridge was Milton’s university, and Milton was the last great representative of Los on earth, hence *twenty-eighth.* There are twenty-eight Friends in all, as also twenty-eight heavens in *M.* As a multiple of four, twenty-eight is a ‘perfect’ number.

P1. 36.3 *The Friends of Albion* Albion’s cathedral cities \(see note on 34.29\). There are twenty-eight in all, of which four appear in 34.40–51, and the rest arrive in 36.21.

45 *And these the Twenty-four* \(See previous note.\) The list of Albion’s Friends begins here and is continued on Pl. 41.

48 *Selsey* Threatened by coastal erosion, Selsey’s village and church were moved inland to Chichester in 1075.

P1. 37.1–2 *Bath… the physician and/The poisoner* In Geoffrey of Monmouth’s *History*, Merlin prophesies that Bath’s healing waters will ‘bring forth death’. B.’s meaning possibly is that physical healing may be spiritual harm.

5–6 *To cast Jerusalem… to Poplar & Bow… Malden* G& *Canterbury* East London and east England – the direction of Jerusalem’s ‘fall’ \(as in 5.48 and 27.41\).

7–8 *Islington & Pancrass, Marybone… Tyburn* Moves in an arc from north to west London.

11 *She fled to Lambeths mild Vale* Blake lived in Lambeth from 1791 to 1800. The following passage allegorizes the‘protection’ of Jerusalem by Blake’s love. The encroaching *Rephaim* \(1. 12\) is Philistine territory.

15 *There is a Grain of Sand* ‘To see a World in a Grain of Sand’ \(‘Auguries of Innocence’, Pickering MS., p. 506 above\).

The design at the foot of this plate shows a man with his head on his knees. At his side is a scroll of mirror-writing: ‘Each Man is in/his Spectres power/Untill the arrival/of that Hour,/When his Humanity/awake/And cast his Spectre/Into the Lake.’ A draft of these lines is in the Notebook, p. 494.

P1. 38 The general theme of this plate is the destructive effect of Albion’s fall, especially in producing war and enmity among men.

P1. 38.1 The Zoas are acting their worst selves, though in self-defence.

5 *the Four Complexions* A phrase not used elsewhere: the qualities or humours of the Four Zoas?

6 *Oaks* Associated with human sacrifice. See DRUIDS.

7 *Tharmas dash’d on the Rocks… in Mexico* Tharmas, when disorganized, is water. The reference is to Aztec human sacrifice, associated for B. with Druidism.

37 *Oshea and Caleb fight* Joshua and Caleb were stoned by their brothers for insisting that Canaan could be conquered and settled \(Numbers 14:7–10\).

39 *Balaam* A Moabite who was converted to the side of the Israelites.

48 *We smell the blood of the English\!* From the folk-tale giant’s chant: ‘Fe Fi Fo Fum/I smell the blood of an Englishman.’

65 *Wicker Idol* Druid figure in which men were supposedly burned alive, according to Caesar’s *Commentaries.*

66 *Canaanite… Egyptian* Nations hostile to Israel.

74 *All you my Friends & Brothers* Los addresses his fellow Zoas, now associated with the Friends of Albion.

Pl. 39.5–6 *Albion dark,/Repugnant* Albion repels his Zoas, resists being returned to Eden and rolls backwards into Ulro.

P1. 40.1–2 *Bath… mild spoke* In 1804, Richard Warner of Bath preached and published a radically pacifist sermon, *War Inconsistent with Christianity*. Here, the ‘healing city’ preaches that man can be healed only by Jesus.

17 *Albions Western Gate is clos’d* This is the entrance to Eden. It has been closed since the poem’s beginning.

19 *When Africa in sleep* This story that ‘Africa’ once rebelled like ‘Albion’ is not mentioned elsewhere.

40\] Line added by engraving on the etched plate.

P1. 41.7 *Oxford, immortal Bard\!* Possibly Edward March, Fellow of Oriel, referred to by B. as ‘Edward the Bard of Oxford’ \(letter to Hayley, 27 January 1804\).

P1. 42 Albion now is confirmed in error, and opposes ‘Righteousness’ and ‘Justice’ to Los’s mercy.

P1. 42.3–4 *He saw… own beloveds* Albion has cursed his own free impulses, hereafter referred to as his ‘little ones’.

29 *a limit of Opakeness*… *a limit of Contraction* imply, respectively, ‘hardness’ of heart and ‘narrowness’ of perception. These limits were established by the Saviour in Pl. 31.

32–3 *the Saviour… forms Woman* The creation of sexes is necessary for Generation; Generation is necessary for progress towards redemption. Without it, humanity would remain static and doomed.

41 *these little ones… the Lords anointed* Albion’s own impulses, which he seeks to destroy, are favoured by God.

47 *fiend*\] Etched ‘friend’, probably in error.

51 *Blackheath & Hounslow*… *Norwood & Finchley* London’s east, west, south, north.

76 *Serpent Temples* Druid temples.

80 *Norwood & Finchley & Blackheath & Hounslow* See 1. 51 above.

P1. 43 The scene is sunset, preceding Albion’s Dark Night.

P1. 43.9 *The Reactor* That part of Albion which believes in Sin and Repentance? The term is not used elsewhere.

14–15 *Reaction… Action* Newton’s famous Third Law is that ‘every Action must have an equal but opposite Reaction’. This fits B.’s theory of the necessary contraries in human life *\(MHH* Pls. 3–4\). But Albion has allowed his Reaction \(his Morality\) to dominate him totally.

18 *Ephratah* Bethelehem.

28 *rocks*\] Etched ‘locks’, probably in error \(see 1. 2\).

        *two Immortal forms* Los’s Spectre and Emanation flee from Albion’s mind.

29 *We alone are escaped* The messengers of disaster to Job each repeat, ‘I only am escaped alone to tell thee.’ In the remainder of this plate, the ‘two forms’ relate the initial Fall of Albion \(a version similar to that III *FZ* in\). Albion’s errors are, first, the worship of his own Shadow, and second, the rejection of Luvah.

P1. 44.2 *Spectre* In this episode the Spectre of Los is his friend, not his foe. L1. 9–15 seem autobiographical, referring to Blake’s Felpham troubles.

11 *Uncircumcision* Always a negative term in Blake, signifying retention of selfhood.

18 *Feminine Allegories* Also a negative term. ‘Allegory’ in B. usually means ‘Church-propagated Lie’.

34–5 *Tabernacle… Cherubim* The Tabernacle of the Female is like that described in Exodus 25, with a veiled inner room called the Holy of Holies. See CHERUBIM.

38 Albion’s submission to Vala brings him to his nadir. But this is necessary for salvation, just as Generation is necessary for Regeneration.

P1. 45 Los begins his exploration of Albion’s interior life.

P1. 45.7 *Minute Particular* Usually a term B. uses to refer to the details of a work of art. Here it means ‘Englishmen’.

12 *Heber & Terah* Ancestors of Abraham. The imagery of the previous lines is that of making bricks from a mould.

14–16 *Highgate… Rivers side* Los walks the fringes of London, from north \(Urthona’s realm\) to east \(Luvah’s realm\).

        *the Isle/Of Leuthas Dogs* The Isle of Dogs, a district famous for vice.

18 *kennels* Open drains, gutters.

25 *Bethlehem* Bedlam, the madhouse \(lit. ‘house of bread’\).

32 The revenger acts against Providence, which works by forgiveness rather than punishment.

37–8 *hinder the Sons/Of Albion from taking vengeance* Specifically political: hinder England from punishing France \(here represented by Luvah\).

40 *Westminster & Marybone* Los now moves westwards, the direction of Liberty and the closed gate towards Eden.

Pl. 46.1 *his disease* Albion’s disease is Moral Virtue.

Pl. 47.9 *the cries of War on the Rhine & Danube* The Napoleonic wars.

Pl. 48.1 *These were his last words* Picks up from Albion’s collapse, Pl. 24, but now a comfort is added: the couch of the scriptures is built for Albion’s repose.

13–14 *Beneath the bottoms of the Graves*… *a place* Beulah is at the joining-place of Eden, Ulro and Generation. Here begins a movement of comfort, as Erin and the Daughters of Beulah create a protective space for exiled Jerusalem. This parallels the couch of the scriptures built by the Saviour for Albion, mentioned above.

27 *the… Friends of Albion* His cities, who were unable to save him \(Pl. 39\).

28 *an Aged pensive Woman* Erin.

30–38 *she took/A Moment of Time… an Atom of Space* Theopening-up of times and spaces for recovery of lost souls is an essential labour of Beulah. See *FZ* 1.5.29–37; *M* Pl. 28.

35 *a Rainbow* A promise that Mankind will not be destroyed, no matter how sinful.

44 *his seventh Furnace* Los’s seventh furnace corresponds to the final cycle of history, before the apocalypse.

Pl. 49.4–5 *Rathlin… Drogheda* Irish place-names.

9 *Jerusalem… Shiloh* The two sacred cities of the Holy Land.

15 *Gate of Havilah* The land of Havilah was encompassed by the Pison, first of the four rivers of Eden. Vala is the Lily of Havilah.

31 *who chargeth his Angels with folly* Quotes Job 4:18.

32–41 Erin’s lament over man’s fallen senses is taken from *M* 5.19–26.

42 *Therefore they are removed* The Sons of Albion have made themselves into Gentiles.

44*the Erythrean Sea* The Red Sea, which swallowed up Pharaoh’s army.

45 *then they shall arise* The Sons of Albion will recover.

53–9 Erin sees the omnipresence of Jehovah as guaranteeing that enemy forces shall be turned into allies.

65 *Yet they are blameless* As in Lear’s exclamation \(IV.vi.172\), ‘None does offend, none, I say none\!’ The doctrine is that of separating the Sinner from his Sin, in order to accomplish ‘Forgiveness of Enemies’ \(1. 75\).

Pl. 50.10 *Come Lord Jesus* The final prayer of the New Testament \(Revelation 22:20\).

11 *If thou hadst been here* From the Lazarus story: ‘Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died’ \(John 11:21\).

27 *to let the Sun go down* ‘Let not the sun go down upon your wrath’ \(Ephesians 4:26\).

30 *O Lamb of God… Sin* ‘Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world’ \(John 1:29\). Note, however, the difference between removing sin itself, and B.’s idea of removing *remembrance* of sin.

CHAPTER 3

This chapter, prefaced by an address ‘To the Deists’, develops the opposition between Rationalism and Revelation. Albion is now basically inactive, submerged by his rational Spectre. Thus the primary movement of the poem shows all the forces of Rationalism consolidating. These forces are devoted to War and to religions of human sacrifice, from the Druids to the ‘Natural Religion’ of Blake’s contemporaries. Their worship of a cruel female Nature is gradually revealed, and this movement culminates in the apotheosis of Rahab–Babylon and her twenty-seven Churches. In the counter-movement, we have Los continuing to build Golgonooza, acting as messenger of the Eternal Conclave, labouring at his furnaces, but helpless to influence outward events. The one hopeful moment comes close to the centre of the chapter, as the Divine Vision tries to comfort a despairing Jerusalem with a vision of Joseph and Mary and the forgiveness of sins. The episodes are as follows:

    Pls. 53–6: Los builds Golgonooza amid Albion’s stone altars, while Albion’s Spectre teaches rationalism. The Eternal Conclave elects the Seven Eyes of God, then returns to the plough, declaiming against rationalism and seeking a messenger. Los – responding as messenger – unsuccessfully entreats the Daughters of Albion, as mothers of mankind, to forsake female will. Pl. 57: Albion, fleeing the Divine Vision, is ploughed under by the plough of nations. Pls. 58–9: The daughters of Albion rejoice at war; Luvah’s and Albion’s spectres mingle. Urizen builds his world – mundane shell and mundane egg – while the daughters of Los work in Cathedron, weaving life.

    Pls. 60–62: The Divine Vision tries to comfort Jerusalem.

    Pls. 63–70: A series of related episodes involving war, vengeance, human sacrifice and the shrinking and binding of Man, dominated by seductive goddess-figures, is seen by Los in his furnaces. He periodically comments and exhorts, but goes unheeded.

    Pls. 71–2: Geographical catalogues: the counties of England assigned to Albion’s children in Eternity; the thirty-two counties of Ireland assigned to the tribes of Israel; the thirty-two nations once contained within Albion.

Pl. 73: Natural Religion creates kings. Los creates prophetic visionaries. Pl. 74: Blake begs the help of the Saviour. The form of Dinah-Erin appears to him. Pl. 75: Apotheosis of Rahab, the Whore of Babylon.

Pl. 52. \(prose\) I *To the Deists* B. labels all religion and philosophy which dispenses with spiritual inspiration ‘Deist’.

6 *He is in the State named Rahab* B. asserts that the preacher of Natural Religion is a worshipper of the kingdoms of this world, allying himself with the Whore of Babylon.

13–15 *your Greek Philosophy… Vegetated Spectre* B. attacks the belief that man is ‘naturally’ good.

43 *Foote* Samuel Foote, 1720–77, author of *The Minor*, an anti-Methodist satire.

44 *Whitefield* George Whitefield, 1714–70, famous Methodist evangelist.

Pl. 52. \(poem\) I *I saw a Monk* A longer draft of this poem is in the Notebook, p. 491.

Pl. 53.4 *Albions Tree* The Tree of Moral Virtue which began to grow at the opening of Chapter 2. See TREE OF MYSTERY.

10 *Seven-fold* Los has seven furnaces, each corresponding to an Eye of God or period of human history.

22 *The Twentyfour… Four* Albion’s twenty-four cathedral cities, led by Verulam, Edinburgh, London and York.

29 *Hinnoms vale* Site of potters’ workshops just outside Jerusalem; also reputedly a place of idolatry and child sacrifice.

Pl. 54.5 *Jerusalem is called Liberty* ‘Liberty’ is the quality Englishmen have always prized as uniquely English.

11 *Seeing his Sons assimilate with Luvah* See 58.19–20, n.

21 *turn these stones to bread* Thus the Devil tempts Jesus in the wilderness, ‘If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread’ \(Matthew 4:3\).

25 *he is named Arthur* B. makes King Arthur, the first monarch of England, a warlike Druid. His love of a false queen, as well as the legend of his death-sleep and promised return, associate him with Albion.

27 *England* Albion is Great Britain; England is one portion of him. In 32.28 she ‘divided into Jerusalem and Vala’.

Pl. 55.12–16 *the Princes of the Dead… Into Egypt* Kings and priests on earth teach their followers to worship phallic aggressiveness, to exalt a chosen people instead of universal brotherhood, and to enforce order. Since order on command is impossible, Joseph is sold by his jealous brothers into slavery. All this is made possible by the veil which separates man and woman, man and man, man and God.

20 *Conclave*\] Etched ‘Concave’.

27 *The Stars in their courses* ‘The stars in their courses fought against Sisera’ \(Judges 5:20\).

31 *the Seven Eyes of God See M* 13.17–26, notes, and Dictionary of Proper Names.

33 *They namd the Eighth* In *M*, the ‘Eighth’ is the Edenic form of the poet Milton.

42–6 *tho we sit down… we are One family* The curse of Ulro is the separation of one person from another. But in Eternity, Man is divinely One. Idea and phrasing are from Psalm 139:7–10: ‘Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?/If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou are there./If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;/Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.’

65–6 *Establishment of Truth… Virginity* Falsehood must be cut away, for Truth to be revealed.

69 *Who will go forth for us\!* When God asks \(Isaiah 6:8\)‘Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?’ Isaiah replies, ‘Here am I; send me.’ Thus Los, in the next plate, is responding like Isaiah.

Pl. 56 Los attempts to persuade the Daughters of Albion towards ‘mildness’. Their replies \(11. 26–8, 39–40\) are self-pitying and devious.

5–7 Jesus, born of woman, knows all in human life, including woman’s role in weaving the flesh. ‘All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field. The grass withereth, the flower fadeth’ \(Isaiah 40:6–7\).



### 8 ***the erred wandering Phantom*** Mankind.

11–14 The Daughters of Albion, says Los, must make the garment of flesh attractive, or no unborn soul will be willing to enter it.

18 *The Sun… a Scythed Chariot… the Moon: a Ship* Los ironically promises to create a world of images suitable to the warlike inclinations of the Daughters.

42 *Look back into the Church Paul\!* \(1\) The Pauline Church, which became woman-dominated through worship of the Virgin; \(2\) St Paul’s Cathedral, in which the three Marys mourn around the Cross.

Pl. 57.7 *Rosamonds Bower* Subterranean labyrinth in Oxfordshire’s Blenheim Park, supposedly built by Henry II for his mistress, Rosamond Clifford. A ballad on Fair Rosamond and her bower is in Percy’s *Reliques.*

Pl. 58.2–3 *Gwendolen dancing to the timbrel/Of War* In triumph after the drowning of Pharaoh’s hosts in the Red Sea, ‘Miriam… took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances’ \(Exodus 15:20\).

3–4 *she divides in twain… the People fall around* In time of war \(such as the Napoleonic wars\) the English people are divided. Those who support the war and those who oppose it both suffer.

11 *The Hermaphroditic Condensations* Supporters of war \(hermaphroditic because monstrous and barren\).

12 *The obdurate Forms* Opposers of war.

19–20 *the comingling*… *Hermaphroditic* May refer \(1\) to the meaningless Truce of Amiens between England and France, 1802; \(2\) to the rationalist \(Deist\) philosophy shared by England and France.

21–51 Los still labours, but Urizen for the time being directs. It is a time of false peace; hence the building has the illusion of restoring the divine order in which all nations are within Albion. But this unity is enforced only by the logic of empire.

Pl. 59.10 *Four Universes round the Mundane Egg* See *M* 34.32–9. The Mundane Egg is the material world in a state of contracted collapse which will nevertheless incubate Eternity. The four universes are the places of the Zoas, left chaotic when the world collapsed inwards.

23 *Cathedrons Looms* The workshop of Enitharmon and her daughters, who are also daughters of Los. Their work is redemptive, as they weave the flesh.

55 In Exodus 35:5–6, 25–6, Moses asks ‘whosoever is of a willing heart’ to bring offerings for the tabernacle of ‘blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ hair’, and ‘all the women whose hearts stirred them up in wisdom’ spun these gifts. The point is that the gifts are offered freely, not by command.

Pl. 60.10–37 The Lamb’s song to Jerusalem mildly rebukes her for giving way to despair \(she was subdued by Vala in Pl. 45; despairing, she burst away from Albion’s bosom with a groan, and was given a space in Erin on the verge of Beulah, in Pl. 48\).

18 *Nimrods Tower* The Tower of Babel.  
    *Mizraim* Egypt.

20 *Tesshina* Unexplained; possibly B.’s misreading of Shinar, which is near Chaldea.

36 *I will lead thee thro the Wilderness* God led the Hebrews through the wilderness by a pillar of fire and a pillar of cloud.

42–3 *her reason grows like/The Wheel of Hand* Jerusalem’s reason becomes controlled by doubt instead of certainty, as is shown in her next speech.

67 *lo I am with thee always* The close of the first Gospel: ‘Lo I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world’ \(Matthew 28:20\).

68 *Only believe* From the story of the raising of Jairus’ dead daughter: ‘Be not afraid, only believe… the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth’ \(Mark 5:36, 39\).

69 *Thy Brother* Lazarus–Albion.

Pl. 61 An interpolation. Jerusalem has been condemned for impurity. So, too, was Mary, when found pregnant out of wedlock. Blake reinterprets the story of Joseph’s doubt\(cleared up by an angel in Matthew 1:19–20\). In his version, Mary is indeed ‘impure’ but is freely forgiven by both God and Joseph.

61.2 *And be comforted O Jerusalem* ‘Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned’ \(Isaiah 40:1–2\).

6 *Art thou more pure* ‘Shall a man be more pure than his maker?’ \(Job 4:17\).

16 *his Angel in my dream* In the gospel story, the angel tells Joseph that Mary has conceived of the Holy Ghost. Here, the angel insists on forgiveness of sin, implying that Mary has sinned; attribution to the Holy Ghost \(1.27\) in this context is ambiguous; perhaps the Holy Ghost has inspired Mary to sin so that she can be forgiven.

30–33 *Emanating into gardens… Jordan* Mary’s joy at being forgiven fills all the known world with joy. *Euphrates, Gihon, Hiddekel* and *Pison* are the four rivers of Eden. *Arnon* and *Jordan* flow into the Dead Sea.

33 *And I heard the voice* Blake hears the voice of Jerusalem, exiled like Ruth among the reapers.

34–5 *or am I/Babylon come up to Jerusalem?* ‘Arise, shine; for thy light is come… And the Gentiles shall come to thy light’ \(Isaiah 60:1–3\).

35 *And another voice answerd* The voice of Vala–Babylon, ‘with whom the Kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication’ \(Revelation 17:2\), realizing the possibility of forgiveness.

39–40 *in the days of her Infancy… person* ‘Thus saith the Lord God unto Jerusalem… thou was cast out in the open field, to the loathing of thy person. And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto thee… Live’ \(Ezekiel 16:3–6\). The remainder of Ezekiel 16 catalogues the abominations of Jerusalem, and the punishments to follow, but promises in the end a renewed covenant.

52 *Every Harlot was once a Virgin* In ‘To The Accuser who is The God of This World’ \(p. 863\): ‘Every Harlot was a Virgin once/Nor canst thou ever change Kate into Nan.’

Pl. 62.7 *Shall Vala bring thee forth\!* Shall the Saviour be born of woman in the state of Nature?

8–12 *the Maternal Line…* *Mary* The twelve women named are all biblical mothers, but the lineage is B.’s invention, fashioned to include ‘heathen’ daughters as ancestresses of Christ. *Cainah*, ‘wife of Cain’, *Ada, Zillah*, Cain’s daughters-in-law. *Naamah*, Zillah’s daughter, Noah’s wife. *Shuah’s daughter, Tamar, Rahab, Ruth*, all were alien women who became linked to the Hebrews. *Bathsheba*, mistress of David, mother of Solomon. *Naamah*, wife of Solomon, mother of apostate King Jehoash. *Mary*, mother of Jesus.

15 From the Lazarus story: ‘Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection and the life’ \(John 11:23–5\)

16 *I know that in my flesh I shall see God* ‘though… worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God’ \(Job 19:25\).

29 *Lo. I am always with thee* See 60.67 n.

30 *Luvahs Cloud* The imagery returns to war and human sacrifice.

38–9 *the Vision of God*… *Spectres* The Vision was obscured by Rationalism.

Pl. 63 The remaining episodes in Chapter 3 are visions in Los’s furnaces helplessly perceived by Los.

5 *Luvah slew Tharmas* Revolutionary France suppressed free speech and simple honesty.

6 *To justice in*… *Paris* British troops occupied France in 1814 and again, after Napoleon’s Hundred Days, in 1815.

7 *Vala… the Daughter of Luvah* Vala is Luvah’s emanation; figuratively, his daughter. She takes vengeance on Albion by producing a Walpurgisnacht of superstition.

9 *Thor & Friga* Norse gods of War and Love.

12 *the Dividing of Reuben & Benjamin* A re-enactment of the separation between Albion and Israel. Reuben is Israel’s oldest son, Benjamin his youngest.

21 *the Looking Glass of Enitharmon* A Platonic image for this world as a mere reflection of eternity. In B.’s *Vision of the Last Judgment*: ‘There exist in the eternal world the permanent realities of everything which we see reflected in this vegetable glass of Nature.’

38 *the Murder was put apart* The murder of Luvah by Albion.

P1. 64.6 The following episode is the triumph of Vala–Nature as a goddess of War.

31 *A dark Hermaphrodite they stood* Vala–Nature united with Albion’s Spectre–Reason. See *For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise*, 1.15 \(p. 862 below\).

35 *Derby Peak yawnd a horrid Chasm* This peak and underground caverns are in the Pennines.

38 *Caves of Machpelah* Burial place of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and their wives.

P1. 65.1 *To decide Two Worlds* Vala and the Spectre decide *between* two worlds, and choose ‘Justice’ or ‘Wrath’ \(punishment\) for Luvah–France, and ‘Mercy’ or ‘Pity’ \(military impunity\) for Albion.

5–56\] Adapted and expanded from *FZ* VII \[b\] 92.9–53. In this and the following passages, the Napoleonic wars incorporate and recapitulate all past wars.

9 *poisonous blue* The woad with which the ancient British warriors painted their bodies.

21–2 *intricate wheels… To perplex youth* The factory system of the Industrial Revolution, and the rationalism on which it is founded. Technology here is handmaiden of War.

33–4 *We were carried away… in ships closd up* Pressgangs and the Navy.

47 Luvah–France’s usurpation of the horses of the sun: Passion trying to be Reason. The Phaethon story here refers specifically to the failure of the French Revolution.

56–7 The sacrifice of Luvah–France is a Druid act.

P1. 66.2 *They build a stupendous Building* Stonehenge is built as the justification for ‘punishment’ of France. The axis of Stonehenge points directly to the rising sun on midsummer’s day \(see 1. 5\). Hence it represents ‘Natural Religion’ – Nature-worship – and ‘Natural Morality’ \(1. 8\).

12 *Her Two Covering Cherubs* Stonehenge is here identified with the Hebrew Tabernacle, which had two cherubim covering the mercy seat in the Holy of Holies.

13 *Cove* & *Stone of Torture* The horseshoe structure surrounding the central ‘altar stone’ at Stonehenge.

20–28 *The Knife of flint… his heart* The sacrifice of Luvah continues, combining elements of circumcision \(in which flint knives were used\), crucifixion, flaying and Aztec sacrifice, in which the priests cut out the hearts of their victims.

41–3 *The Divine Vision*… *globe of blood* Chronological sequence of visions: Moses’ burning bush, the pillar of fire which led the Hebrews in Exodus, Ezekiel’s wheel. A ‘globe of blood’ divides from Los and develops into Enitharmon in *BU* Pls. 13–18, *M* 3.29–33, *f* 86.50–58.

46–8 *The Human form… Albion’s Tree* B. elsewhere treats Nature as a vast, spreading poisonous polypus, and Morality as a vast, spreading, poisonous tree. These symbols now coalesce, and become further identified with the branches of Man’s nervous system, circulatory system and reproductive organs. In brief, the agents of human sacrifice become like their victims: their own humanity is sacrificed.

55 *As the Mistletoe grows on the Oak* Parasitically.

59 *Plinlimmon… Snowdon* Mountains in Wales.

62 *Gwendolen… shuttle… Cambel… beam* The daughters of Albion are weaving at the loom of War. The fibres used are human tissues, and the cutting of the fibres \(67.11\) continues the imagery of human sacrifice.

79 *high Mona* From *Lycidas* 54, ‘the shaggy top of Mona high’, a supposed Druidic site.

Pl. 67.1 *the blood of their Covenant* From Exodus 24:8 and Hebrews 13:20, ‘the blood of the everlasting covenant’.

2 *Rahab & Tirzah* These two figures collectively represent female cruelty, Rahab as mistress–whore, Tirzah as mother.

12 *Calling the Rocks Atomic Origins* The philosophy of Epicurus and Lucretius.

23 *Josephs Coat* Joseph’s brothers stripped off his coat of many colours and dipped it in goat’s blood to simulate his death \(Genesis 37:31–3\).

26–7 *the Rock/Of Horeb* Mt Sinai.

29 *Beth Peor* The burial place of Moses, adjacent to the Promised Land.

41–2 The slaying of Philistine Sisera by Jael, who drove a nail through his head, epitomizes female control of man’s mind, supposedly ‘for his own good’.

67.44–68.9 Tirzah’s speech: her cruelty to Man is all in the name of Love. The passage is adapted from *FZ* VIII.105.30–53.

P1. 68.3 *Ebal, Mount of cursing* The stones of the Law were placed in Mt Ebal, and a curse pronounced on offenders \(Deuteronomy 27\).

17–18 *Thor & Friga… Generation* Norse, Gentile and Greek gods of War \(male\) and Love \(female\) are worshipped by the warriors. B. mistakenly treats Chemosh \(associated with Molech\) as female.

22–3 *Ephraim… Valley of the Jebusite* Place-names within Israel, approaching Jerusalem. *Olivet* is the Mount of Olives.

30 *Bring your Offerings* The Daughters of Albion adore ‘strong men’ and will give their love only to warriors who slay the innocent.

38 *Havilah to Shur* Region of the outcast Ishmaelites \(Genesis 25:18\).

43–4 *Camberwell, Wimbledon, Walton, Esher* Suburbs of London; *Stonehenge* is west, *Malden* east.

51 *Smitten as Uzzah* Uzzah was struck dead for touching the ark of God \(1 Chronicles 13:10\). B.’s interpretation of *ark* and *spear* is sexual.

53–70 The Warrior–lover’s speech to the Daughter\(s\) of Albion makes clear B.’s major point that war is a sublimation of unsatisfied sexuality.

55–61 *Rehob in Hamath… Meribah Kadesh* The latter was a stopping-place for the Hebrews in the wilderness whence spies were sent to survey Canaan. They surveyed the land up to ‘Rehob, as men come to Hamath’ \(Numbers 13:21\). B. interprets this episode as a provocation to war.

P1. 69.6 The One Male is not a unity, for all the men who compose him are in competition with each other.

11 *Leah & Rachel* Jacob’s two competing jealous wives.

14–31 *Beulah… Vegetating Death* The sacred tabernacle of the Israelites was an image of sexuality, as experienced in the dream-world in Beulah. But in the physical world sexuality binds men down to the cycle of life and death.

32 *the Spectres of the Dead awake in Beulah* Beulah becomes infected by the lower world.

38–44 \(1\) A final opposition between the conventional sexuality of ‘a Secret Place’ *versus* true embracings of whole beings; \(2\) a final opposition between the conventional religion of a veiled sanctuary accessible only to the High Priest *versus* the true holiness embodied in all God’s people. The tabernacle of the Hebrews in the wilderness was surrounded by their tents, yet the common people were forbidden to enter it. The veil of this tabernacle was rent when Jesus died.

45 *Wandering Reuben* The ‘wandering Jew’.

P1. 70.1 *mighty Hand* Leader of the Sons of Albion, and representing them all. He is three-headed like Cerberus, for the brothers Robert, John and Leigh Hunt, publishers of *The Examiner;* and for the rational trinity, Bacon, Newton and Locke.

17–18 *Rahab/Sat deep within him* Rahab, the whore, controls Hand by promises of sensual delight. She has a heart where a brain should be.

P1. 71.10–49 A catalogue of the territories belonging to the children of Albion in Eternity. \(Wiltshire and Staffordshire are named twice; Lancashire is omitted.\)

50–51 *the Four Sons of Jerusalem… Bromion* In *Milton* and in *f* 15.22, these are the four loyal sons of Los. Their loyalty unites them also to Jerusalem.

P1. 72.1–27 A catalogue of correspondences between the counties of Ireland and the twelve tribes of Israel. The *Four Camps* \(1. 2\) corresponding to the *Four Provinces* of Ireland were the historic groupings of the Hebrews in the wilderness.

32 *And Thirty-two the Nations* The design in this plate shows two angels weeping next to a globe on which is inscribed: ‘Continually Building. Continually Decaying because of Love & Jealousy.’

50–51 *Fenelon, Guion, Teresa* The seventeenth-century quietist theologian; his female disciple, imprisoned for her opinions; Teresa of Avila, the renowned sixteenth-century mystic and leader in the Catholic Reformation. *Whitefield*, the Methodist evangelist; *Hervey*, author of *Meditations Among the Tombs.* All are praised for retaining and propagating their faith despite opposition.

53 Mirror-writing: ‘Women the comforters of Men become the Tormentors & Punishers’.

P1. 73.16 Los’s four sons examine the constellations ruled by these biblical giants.

28 *Peleg & Joktan* were the two sons of Eber; in their day ‘was the earth divided’ \(Genesis 10:25\). *Esau & Jacob* were the competing sons of Isaac. *Saul* tried to kill *David*, who later succeeded him as king. The three pairs of men represent the enmities caused by ‘contraction’ of human vision.

29 *Voltaire* An attack on Voltaire’s scorn of Christianity.

35–7\] A list of kings and conquerors spiritually descended from Satan. B. deleted 1. 37.

41–2\] A list of spiritual, philosophical and poetic leaders, opposites of the kings. B. deleted 1. 42.

54 *Primrose Hill* This was on the outskirts of London. B. told Crabb Robinson, 10 Dec. 1825, ‘I have conversed with the Spiritual Sun – I saw him on Primrose Hill.’

P1. 74.24–6 In music, Blake preferred melody to harmony; in painting, clear outline to chiaroscuro; and in literature \(or philosophy\), vision of particulars rather than generalizing abstraction.

28 *Hyle roofd Los* as Hayley patronizingly restricted Blake.

30 *Gog* The defeat of Gog in the last days is prophesied in Ezekiel 38–9 and Revelation 20:8.

41–57 *how the Daughters… Cabul* The separation of the twelve tribes of Israel from Albion, and the lands apportioned to each.

54 *Dinah… Erin* Dinah was the one daughter of Jacob. As her lover Shechem was murdered by her brothers, so England ‘murdered’ Ireland’s faith by religious intolerance.

Pl. 75.2 Merlin and Bladud are associated with King Arthur. Bladud was supposed to have founded Bath, practised magic, and died attempting to fly.

3 *The Cup* Babylon’s ‘cup… full of abominations’ \(Revelation 17:4\).

10–20 *Twenty-seven Heavens… War* See Dictionary of Proper Names. This list of successive erroneous religions leading towards apocalypse is adapted from *M* 37.35–43.

CHAPTER 4

This final chapter, prefaced by an address ‘To the Christians’, divides into two parts. The first \(Pls. 78–93\) depicts Los’s culminating struggles as he approaches the realization of his vision, and the Covering Cherub–Antichrist is revealed. The second \(Pls. 94–9\) brings the awakening of Albion, his reunion with Jesus, and the renewal of his full humanity. The episodes are:

        Pls. 78–80: While the Sons of Albion besiege Erin and Jerusalem, ruined Jerusalem laments, as does – surprisingly – triumphant Vala. Pls. 80–82: The turning-point of the poem comes as the seductive Daughters of Albion begin unwittingly to serve Los’s purposes.

    Pls. 83–8: Los, with renewed confidence, becomes a watchman of the night. As the Daughters of Albion create the allegory of Canaan, he makes it into divine analogy, planting seeds of future truth and beauty. He sees a vision of the true Jerusalem, and steadfastly continues his labours. At this point, however, his emanation, Enitharmon, rebels.

    Pl. 89: The apotheosis of the Covering Cherub, identified as Antichrist.

    Pls. 90–93: Destructive efforts continue by the Sons and Daughters of Albion, the Spectre of Los, and Enitharmon. But Los contends against them with increasing certitude.

    Pls. 94–5: Time finishes; Albion awakes and reunites with England–Britannia. Pl. 96: Albion meets Jesus in friendship, and as the Covering Cherub comes on, sacrifices himself for Jesus. At this moment, the nightmare of the poem ceases, for ‘all was a dream’. Pl. 97–9: A final description of regenerate Man.

    Pl. 77. \(epigraph\) 1 *I give you the end of a golden string*\] From lines in the Notebook \(p. 624\).

3–4 *‘Saul Saul’/‘Why persecutest thou me’* The words of Jesus in Saul’s vision on the road to Damascus \(Acts 9:4\). In the following argument, B. reminds nominal ‘Christians’ that they too are in need of conversion.

\(prose\) 5 *seed of a wild flower* From the parable of the tares sown among the wheat, Matthew 13:24–30.

19 *What is that Talent* From the parable of the talents, Matthew 25.

20 *What are the Treasures* From Matthew 6:19–21.

22 *What are all the Gifts* From Matthew 7:7–11.

\(poetry\) 1 *I stood among my valleys* B. places himself in the south, or intellectual region. His vision contains a devouring wheel, implicitly opposed to the wheel of ‘living creatures’ in Ezekiel 1:16, 21.

12 *a Watcher… Holy-One* From Daniel 4:13. John in Revelation similarly converses with angels.

18 *Caiaphas* The high priest who condemned Jesus for blasphemy.

31 *Publicans & Harlots* Jesus is several times in the Gospels named as friend of ‘publicans and sinners’ or ‘publicans and harlots’, for ‘They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick’ \(Matthew 9:12\). Publicans were Jewish tax-collectors for Rome, hence despised by their fellow-Jews.

P1. 78. 12 *Forty-two Gates of Erin* A mistake? Ireland has thirty-two counties, as in Pl. 72.

26 *the Giants causway* Headland composed of basalt columns in the north of Ireland.

31 *My brother and my father* Albion is both brother and father to Jerusalem.

    *God hath forsaken me* Christ’s words on the cross: ‘My God, why hast thou forsaken me?’ \(Matthew 27:46\).

32 *arrows of the Almighty* From Job 6:4.

P1. 79 The lament of Jerusalem is that Albion and the Holy Land, once identical, have become divided and merely geographical places.

68 *Tell me O Vala thy purposes* Jerusalem once again questions Vala–Nature’s separation of humanity into sexes.

78 *Wherefore then do you realize these nets* Why do you make these nets \(of sexuality\) real, when they should be accepted as illusions.

P1. 80. 3 *I am a worm* ‘I am a worm, and no man’ \(Psalm 22:6\).

6–7 *Vala… Lamenting* We expect Vala to triumph. She laments \(1\) because she wishes Albion to remain ‘dead’, and fears he will be reborn; \(2\) she knows inwardly that her role of murderer is not her true role, and hopes, unconsciously, for a return to Eternity.

16 *My Father* Luvah is both father and beloved of Vala.

27 *I… keep his body* Vala keeps Albion’s body.

35–6 *To weave Jerusalem… A Dragon form* Vala hopes to clothe Jerusalem in War, thus creating ‘a dragon red and hidden harlot’ – another Church for men to worship.

51–2 *Rahab… Refusd to take a definite form* Rahab refused to reveal, openly, what she was.

57 *Skiddaws top* A mountain in the Lake District.

61 *Drawing out fibre by fibre* Cambel is \(1\) alluring Hand; \(2\) using his substance as thread for her loom.

82 *the Wine-press of Luvah* At once Love and War. It presses the juice from ‘human grapes’ in *FZ* IX.

P1. 81.2 *Merlin the piteous* Merlin was undone by love of a woman, Vivian.

8 *is the Cruel become an Infant* The female will seeks to reduce Man to infantile dependence.

11 *Josephs beautiful integument* \(1\) His coat of many colours; \(2\) his skin.

    *my Beloved* Hyle.

P1. 82.17 *So saying she took a Falsehood* The design for Pl. 81 shows the nude Gwendolen pointing to the following lines in mirror-writing while holding her left hand behind her:

In Heaven the only Art of Living  
  Is Forgetting & Forgiving  
    Especially to the Female  
But if you on Earth Forgive  
  You shall not find where to Live.

29 *But hide America* America represents potential liberty.

33 *the Friend of Sinners* Epithet for Jesus, here applied to Jerusalem.

34 *close up her… Ark* Make Jerusalem chaste by force, so that Man, sexually \(and spiritually\) frustrated, will exhaust himself in War.

43\] All copies give ‘hands’ twice in this line, but the sense is clear. In the Song of Solomon 7:4, ‘Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fish-pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath–Rabbin.’ Gwendolen makes the song of love into a song of crucifixion of her lover Hyle.

44 ‘O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother\!… Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm’ \(Song of Solomon 8: 1, 6\).

47 *And Hyle a winding Worm* At this crucial point in the poem, female will is shown to be ultimately self-defeating. The winding worm is \(1\) a further degeneration of helpless infancy – Gwendolen’s wish has come true, as in fairy tales, beyond her intention; \(2\) the phallic worm; \(3\) the devouring worm. Gwendolen’s ‘perfect’ beauty \(1. 50\) is now useless to her, and the entire episode – reduction of ‘warrior’ to ‘worm’ – recalls Shakespeare’s *Antony and Cleopatra.* But instead of a tragic close, this metamorphosis will bring the possibility of genuine love to the Daughters of Albion.

56–7 Here begins a turn for the better. Los’s wrath gives him new strength. In the following passages the Daughters of Albion begin despite themselves to serve Los’s redemptive purposes.

59 *Billingsgate* The London fish-market, famous for foul and abusive language; also a term for foul, vituperative language itself. Thus: Blake–Los is angry at Cambel and releases a ‘blast’ of Billingsgate at her.

81–2 *I know… I can at will expatiate* Los knows that in his eternal form he can \(1\) wander freely; \(2\) speak or write freely.

P1. 83.5 *I shall become an Infant… Enion\! Tharmas\!* Los feels he is in danger of losing his strength and vision. In *FZ* Los and Enitharmon, in their fall, entered the world of Generation as the infant children of Tharmas and Enion.

9–13 *Sussex… Hants, Devon & Wilts… Mystery* Sussex rejects the unwed mother. Los demands that the other three counties \(supposed Druid sites\) must make definite forms for the cruelties of Vala and Luvah, nailing them to their own error as they have sacrificed other victims.

34–7 The indefinite and always changing form of this earth, believed at some times to be the centre of the universe, at other times to be a globe in space, and at still others to be flat. The appearances alter as mortal perceptions – controlled by the Daughters of Albion – alter. But realities are permanent.

51 *the old Parent* Father Thames; perhaps Tharmas, as in *FZ.*

59 *the Tribes of Llewellyn* The Welsh.

61 *The night falls thick* Possibly an echo of *Macbeth* III.ii.50–51: ‘Light thickens, and the crow/Makes wing to th’ rooky wood.’ Los now becomes Watchman of London as Ezekiel was made ‘watchman unto the house of Israel’ \(3:17\). Like the watchman of God in Isaiah 21:9, he will ultimately see that ‘Babylon is fallen, is fallen’.

76–7 *Putting on his golden sandals… girding himself* In Acts 12:8 an angel frees the Apostle Peter from prison, saying, ‘Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals… and follow me.’

82 *the Dogs of Leutha* The Isle of Dogs in the Thames; the dogs of Diana, the virgin huntress, which destroyed Actaeon. Here they seem tame.

P1. 84.31–Pl. 85.9 *they took the Falshood… in the Space* See 82.17. The Daughters of Albion, still hoping to subdue their threatening male counterparts, unintentionally imitate the protective activities usually performed by Daughters of Beulah and by Enitharmon. \(In *M* 8.39–44, Enitharmon creates a space for Satan and Michael and ‘clos’d it with a tender moon’.\) The Space created by the Daughters is an ‘Allegory’ – a theological lie. But Los uses this falsehood to plant seeds of truth. Thus: the idea of a ‘Chosen People’ is based on a ‘Jealous God’. This is a falsehood. Yet from this falsehood springs the truth of the Gospels.

85.22 *O lovely mild Jerusalem\!* Los now sees the ‘New Jerusalem’ of Revelation 21–2.

P1. 86.1 *Six Wings* From Isaiah 6:2.

4 *Holiness to the Lord* From the description of Aaron’s sacred vestments \(Exodus 28\). These words were graved on a gold plate for his brow. Jerusalem’s *immortal gems, gold & azure & purple*, and *bells* are also from Aaron’s vestments. *Gates of pearl* are from Revelation 21:21.

18 *The River of Life & Tree of Life* From Revelation 22:1–2.

19 ‘And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband’ \(Revelation 21:2\).

32 *Javan* Progenitor of the inhabitants of Greece \(Genesis 10:2\).

50 On the verge of realizing his vision, Los must contend with a final obstacle: the rebellion of his own emanation. This episode \(Pls. 86–8, 92–3\) recapitulates the division and jealousies between Los and Enitharmon developed in B.’s earlier works, notably *BU* and *FZ*, where the division formed a part of Man’s original Fall. Here, however, the rebellion of Ehitharmon comes at the end of history instead of the beginning, and is the final sexual split which precipitates the coming of Antichrist.

P1. 86.62–Pl. 87.2 In *FZ* 1. Pp.8–9, Enion gives birth to Los and Enitharmon, who then repel her, as here.

P1. 88.23 *Sussex shore* Felpham, where Blake and Catherine lived under Hayley’s patronage.

56 *Jerusalem took the Cup* The ‘cup of abominations’ in Revelation 17:4, held by Vala in *f* 63.39 and Rahab in *f* 75.3. Jerusalem is about to poison herself.

58 *Hermaphroditic* Self-contradictory, barren.

P1. 89.4 *Love & Wrath* These are contraries and should be opposed. When united in the ‘Wine-press’ of false religion, both are meaningless.

6–7 *Pharisaion*… *Saddusaion* Pharisees, scribes, elders, high priest, priest, sadducees.

9 *the Covering Cherub* The whole ruling body of the old Church, just catalogued, and identified as Antichrist. The ensuing description of his head, heart and loins is in perverse parallel to the vision of Jerusalem \(Pl. 86\). For the sexual symbolism of the Covering Cherub, see Dictionary of Proper Names.

13 *In three nights* Three nights between Crucifixion and Resurrection.

15 *Gihon* One of the four rivers of Paradise; identified with the ‘perverted Nile’ here. The other rivers are Pison-Arnon \(1. 25\), Hiddekel–Tigris \(1. 35\), and Euphrates \(1. 38\).

19 *the Dragon* Pharaoh is a river dragon in Ezekiel 29:3.

21 *Twelve ridges of Stone* Twelve lines on the Covering Cherub’s brow, one for each of the twelve tribes and twelve Sons of Albion, compose a Druid temple.

33–4 The power of the Covering Cherub spreads north around the rim of the Mediterranean, thence to Europe.

43 The Holy City absorbed and hidden by the Covering Cherub as if devoured.

46 *Seven Kings*… *Five Baalim* For the number of Canaanite tribes, and of Philistine towns, opposing Israel. *Baalim*, ‘idols’.

47 Legendary giants of Canaan.

55 *Horeb* Sinai, the site of the Law.

57 *Midian* Tribe named for a son of Abraham. *Aram* Syria.

58 *Alla* A region of Ulro.

P1. 90 The Sons and Daughters of Albion are seen once again at their destructive work, dividing the tribes of Israel from their rightful places in Albion.

25 *Reuben*… *Surrey* An error? Reuben \(16.44\) belongs in Suffolk, not Surrey.

28–37 A complex and condensed argument. Universal attributes or characteristics \(such as womanliness or lordship\) belong to no single individual but to Man. Private persons who consider themselves as self-sufficient units, rather than as members of a Universal Man or Divine Body, are ‘Blasphemous Selfhoods’. The notion of Christ’s incarnation through virgin birth is both blasphemous and barren. For Jesus, born of impure woman, is another potential egocentric Satan or selfhood. His divinity consists in *casting off* his selfhood, not in *lacking* it.

38 *Come Lord Jesus* The last cry of the New Testament, Revelation 22:21: ‘Even so, come, Lord Jesus.’

    *take on… Body of Holiness* Jesus is to take on a Satanic form, as a garment to shed and a burden to be put off.

58 *Giants of Albion* Sons of Albion.

59 *rocking Stones* Natural rock formations in which a large broad rock balances on a narrow one. B. associates them with the Druid trilithons.

62 *a Circle in Malden or in Strathness or Dura* Malden has some prehistoric remains, though no stone circles. Strathness, the valley of Loch Ness, is near stone circles at Muir of Ord and Cononbridge. Dura, an island off Scotland, has rocky caves.

P1. 91.7–10 *the Worship of God… there is no other/God* Adapted from *MHH* Pl. 29. But the new definition of God as ‘the intellectual fountain of humanity’ alters the meaning radically.

32 *The Spectre* The spectre of Los. His ‘buildings’ are last-gasp rationalizations of the *status quo*, and Los destroys them.

32–3 *Heavens/Like to a curtain* From Psalm 104:2.

34 *Smaragdine Table of Hermes* A famous text in occult tradition and alchemy. B. apparently rejects occultism as too materialistic.

38–9 *Leviathan… Behemoth* The great sea-monster and land-monster of Job 40:15, 41:1; associated in two paintings of B.’s 1809 exhibition, and in the job engravings, with Nelson and Pitt.

50 *every Ratio of his Reason* Every systematic rationale.

Pl. 92.1 *What do I see?* The following vision is one of *unification* of nations within Albion, instead of division and dispersion.

12 *Then thou wilt Create another Female* Eve’s fear in *Paradise Lost* IX.826–9 is similar.

15–17 Los promises that the crimes, punishments, accusations, jealousies, revenges, murders and deceits of present life – the major facts of life – will in Eternity become things merely to be imagined or recalled as a caution.

P1. 93 The design here shows three Accusers crouching and pointing. Their bodies bear the inscription: ‘Anytus Melitus & Lycon thought Socrates a Very Pernicious Man. So Caiphas thought Jesus’.

1–16 Enitharmon selfishly pleads with her sons. She wants them to love her alone.

5 *Ocalythron & Elynittria* Emanations of Rintrah and Palamabron.

6*East Moor*… *Cheviot* Both part of the highlands of England which run north to south and ‘divide’ the country.

8 *Reuben*… *Mandrakes* Reuben gave his mother, Leah, mandrakes to make her attractive to Jacob.

10 *Rintrahs Plow… Satans… Team* In the Bard’s Song in *M* Pls. 7–8 Satan usurped Palamabron’s harrow. This is either the same story mis-remembered, or a similar one.

17–26 Los makes a counter-argument, as in *M* 23.32, where he similarly tries to reassure his sons.

26 *that Signal of the Morning* The darkest hour is just before the dawn. In Revelation the appearance of all the forces of evil in their strength – Satan, the Beast and Babylon – immediately precedes the Second Coming of Christ in glory.

27 *Mam-Tor* The peak in Derbyshire whence Los denounced female will \(30.41\).

Pl. 94.5 *The weeds of Death* Seaweed; shrouds.

18 *Time was Finished\!* The sounding of the seventh trumpet in Revelation 10:6 announces that there is ‘time no longer’, and the remainder of the book occurs outside of time.

20 *England who is Brittannia* ‘Brittannia’ is the conventional female personification, as in Thomson’s ‘Rule Britannia’ \(1740\), ‘England’ her guiding portion.

Pl. 95.10 *The Four Elements* Albion’s Four Zoas \(11. 16–20\).

P1. 96.35 Albion at last sacrifices himself for his friend Jesus, and the nightmare of history is finished immediately.

P1. 97.3–4 ‘Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away, for, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’ \(Song of Solomon 2:10–11\).

P1. 98.1–11 The annihilation of the Spectre by the living bow and arrows of Love.

98.9 *Bacon & Newton* & *Locke* The rational trinity, now included among the ‘Chariots of the Almighty’. The chariots – vehicles of human genius – are ‘Sexual Threefold’, not Human Fourfold, because all these men were mortals, working within the limits of the world of generation.

11 *Sexual Threefold*\] Mended from ‘Sexual Twofold’.

12–27 The description of the Fourfold Man.

28–56 The creative life of Man.

39–40 *clearly seen/And seeing* ‘For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as… I am known’ \(1 Corinthians 13:12\). In Plotinus, ‘They see themselves in others. For all things are transparent, and there is nothing dark or resisting, but every one is manifest to every one… For every one has all things in himself… and the splendour is infinite.’

44 The serpent of Sin, being forgiven, becomes human.

45 *the Covenant of Jehovah*\] Mended from ‘thy Covenant Jehovah’; restored to ‘thy’ in copy \[f\].

46 *the Covenant of Priam* The classic set of values which encourages military might and conquest, instead of mutual love and forgiveness. This ‘Covenant’ is then linked to Graeco–Roman ‘virtue’, Hebraic–Christian ‘Good & Evil’, Druidic human sacrifice, and finally British colonial practices.

52–3 *the Triple Headed Gog–Magog… Nations* ‘Gog and Magog’ were to be overthrown in the last days \(Revelation 20:8–9\). Hand, the leader of Albion’s sons, is triple-headed in 70.4. Statues of Gog and Magog stood outside London’s Guildhall. Thus: Commerce, the exploitation of the many poor by the few rich, was responsible for British imperialism.

53 *the Spectrous Oath* Albion’s reasoning spectre, having overthrown him, announced \(54.16\) ‘I am God.’



### ***The Everlasting Gospel***

This late and fragmentary work consists of nine scattered entries in B.’s Notebook, and three sections on a separate scrap of paper watermarked 1818, which were probably – though not necessarily – intended for a single poem defining Blake’s unorthodox view of Jesus and the Christian Gospel. The present text follows Erdman’s conjecture that the prose and verse on the separate paper constitute a preliminary handling of the theme, and that the section on Notebook p. 120 \(sewn in at the end of the Notebook\) is probably also early. Though the work as it now stands is ‘rough’ in both tone and organization, it is well to remember that more ‘finished’ works such as *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell* and the fair draft of ‘Auguries of Innocence’ cultivate a not dissimilar air of spontaneous flourish. ‘The Everlasting Gospel’ is, in fact, an expanded version of ideas initially stated almost thirty years earlier in *MHH* Pl. 23.



### ‘IF MORAL VIRTUE WAS CHRISTIANITY…’

14 *Rhadamanthus* In classic mythology, a son of Zeus and Europa, noted in life for justice, and made a judge in Hades.



### ‘WAS JESUS BORN OF A VIRGIN PURE…’

4–5 In *f* Pl. 61, B. makes Mary an adulteress, though not a harlot, and she is forgiven by God. Mary Magdalene, from whom Jesus cast out seven devils \(Mark 16:9\), is also traditionally considered a ‘fallen’ woman.

16 Caiaphas was the Jewish High Priest in Jesus’ time. In the following lines \(17–48\), B. has him list Jesus’ offences against the Law. But 11. 21–6, inserted from the bottom and margin of the page, are clearly Blake’s voice, not Caiaphas’.

17 Jesus antagonized the Pharisees on several occasions by performing ‘unlawful’ acts such as healing on the Sabbath.

20 The disciples Simon \(called Peter\), Andrew, James and John were fishermen. The idea that common men could be spiritual leaders would, of course, antagonize a priest.

27 From the episode of the Gadarene swine, Luke 8:27–37, Mark 5:1–19.

32 Jesus’ words to his mother at Cana \(John 2:4\).

34 From the episode of young Jesus staying to question the doctors in the Temple instead of returning home with his parents \(Luke 2:41–51\).

37 From Luke 10:1–20.

47–8 From the episode of the woman taken in adultery \(John 8:3–11\).



### ‘THE VISION OF CHRIST THAT THOU DOST SEE…’

3–4 *a great hook nose… mine* On Notebook p. 64 B. remarked: ‘I always thought Jesus Christ was a snubby or I should not have worshipd him if I had thought he had been one of those long spindle-nosed rascals.’

9 *Melitus* One of the accusers in the trial of Socrates.



### ‘WAS JESUS CHASTE…’

4 The adulteress of John 8 is not named, but B. identifies her with Mary Magdalene and perhaps with the Virgin Mary.

29 Jehovah in Exodus 33:14 promises to accompany Moses with ‘my presence’, to show his favour. B. elsewhere calls Jehovah, the law-given and punisher of the Old Testament, ‘leprous’.

47–8 Quotes John 8:10–11. The remainder of the colloquy is of course B.’s invention.

54 From the curse on the serpent in Genesis 3:14: ‘dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life’.

64 From I Corinthians 6:19: ‘your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you’.

81 *the shadowy Man* Revealed in 1. 96 as the serpent, Satan, who demands punishment rather than forgiveness, and who devours Man’s material body.



### ‘SEEING THIS FALSE CHRIST…’

Brief fragment written below the previous section, and apparently referring to another passage, now lost.



### ‘DID JESUS TEACH DOUBT…’

Written sideways in the margin of p. 52, possibly related to the note at the top of the page: ‘This was spoke by My Spectre to Voltaire Bacon etc.’



### ‘WAS JESUS GENTLE…’

3 From the episode in Luke 2:41–51.

15 From the temptation of Jesus by Satan in the wilderness, Matthew 4, Luke 4. Satan bids Jesus turn stones to bread, Matthew 4:3, and offers him the Kingdoms of the world ‘if thou wilt fall down and worship me’, Matthew 4:9.

17 John the Baptist was killed by King Herod.

32 From the vision in Revelation 20:2.

48 From the scourging of merchants and money-changers in the temple, John 2:13–16.



### ‘WAS JESUS HUMBLE…’

A first draft followed by an expanded second draft.



### THE EVERLASTING GOSPEL, ‘WAS JESUS HUMBLE…’ REVISED

4 From Matthew 7:9, Luke 11:11: ‘what man… if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?’

11 *the rich learned Pharisee* Nicodemus, in John 3:1–21, to whom Jesus declares, ‘Ye must be born again.’

16 From the response of the congregation in Capernaum, Matthew 7:29.

18 From Matthew 11:28–9.

41 *dr Priestly* Joseph Priestley, the discoverer of oxygen.

83 Jesus on the cross prayed, ‘Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do’ \(Luke 23:34\).

86 *I never will Pray for the World* From John 17:9: ‘I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.’

89 Refers to Jesus’ prayer in Gethsemane, ‘O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me,’ immediately retracted with ‘nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt’ \(Matthew 26:39, Mark 14:36, Luke 22:42\). B.’s sense in this passage may be that Jesus rejects God’s interpretation of the Crucifixion as an act of humility to be followed by revenge. Instead, he scorns the death of the body – which is only a ‘fiction’ – and thus does not need to be either humble now or vengeful at Judgement Day.

103–6 These final lines are adapted from ‘Auguries of Innocence’, 11. 125–8, p. 510.



### ‘I AM SURE THIS JESUS WILL NOT DO…’

A couplet written marginally near the end of the previous section.



### ***For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise***

In 1793 B. published an emblem-book entitled *For Children: The Gates of Paradise*, consisting of a frontispiece and sixteen designs with brief legends, symbolically depicting the sufferings and limitations of mortal life. Years later \(estimates of the date range between 1806 and 1818\) he reissued this book with a new title, expanded inscriptions, a prologue and three new pages of text. Five complete copies, and seven incomplete, are known. The designs are reproduced in Keynes and Erdman, among other editions, as well as in J. Beer, *Blake’s Humanism*, with a commentary. Facsimiles may be found in the Blake Trust edition \(1969\).



### ****PROLOGUE

8 The ‘corpse’ \(a pun on *corpus?*\) of the Law: the Ten Commandments, placed beneath the Mercy Seat in the Temple.



### THE KEYS OF THE GATES

*The Keys* The numbers to the left of the lines refer to the designs on which they comment.

1 The frontispiece design depicts a caterpillar above a baby-faced chrysalis.

5 Emblem I depicts a woman plucking an infant from under a tree-root.

9–12 Emblems 2–5 depict water, earth, air and fire. Their inscriptions form another quatrain:  
Water: Thou waterest him with Tears  
Earth: He struggles into Life  
Air: On Cloudy Doubts and Reasoning Cares  
Fire: That end in endless strife.

15 The female and her child constitute a hermaphrodite pair because they cannot unite in transcendence of sexuality.

20 Emblem 6 depicts a winged child emerging from a shell. The inscription reads ‘At length for hatching ripe he breaks the shell’ \(from Dryden’s *Palamon and Arcite*, 1069\).

21 When Man is born in a mortal body. The cave, grave and garments of flesh are all neo-Platonic symbols of birth.

27 Emblem 7 depicts a boy catching small winged figures in his hat. One lies on the ground, and one is fleeing. The source of the design may well be *King Lear* \(IV.i.38\): ‘As flies to wanton boys are we to the Gods/They kill us for their sport.’ The inscription reads: ‘What are these? Alas\! the Female Martyr/Is She also the Divine Image?’

31 *My Son\! my Son\!* This is the inscription to Emblem 8, which depicts a youth aiming a spear at an old man. The words are King David’s \(2 Samuel 18:33\) at the death of his rebel son: ‘Would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son\!’

33 Emblem 9 depicts a man preparing to climb a ladder to the moon. The inscription reads: ‘I want\! I want\!’

35 Emblem 10 depicts a man drowning with arm upraised. The inscription reads: ‘Help\! Help\!’

37 Emblem 11 depicts an old bespectacled man, with closed eyes, clipping the wings of a young boy who tries to escape towards the sun. The inscription reads: ‘Aged Ignorance/Perceptive Organs closed, their Objects close.’

39 Emblem 12 depicts Ugolino and his sons in prison. The inscription reads: ‘Does thy God, O Priest, take such vengeance as this?’

42 Emblem 13 depicts an old man’s spirit rising from his deathbed while his family watches. The inscription reads: ‘Fear and Hope are – Vision.’

43 Emblem 14 depicts a traveller with walking stick. The inscription reads: ‘The Traveller hasteth in the Evening.’

45 Emblem 15 depicts an old man entering a stone doorway. The inscription reads: ‘Death’s Door’.

47 Emblem 16 depicts a hooded woman sitting in shadow with a worm winding about. The inscription reads: ‘I have said to the Worm:/Thou art my mother and my sister.’



### TO THE ACCUSER…

1 From Young’s *Night Thoughts* VIII.1417: ‘Satan, thy master, I dare call a dunce.’

8 *The lost Travellers Dream* The lost traveller is man, and Satan is but his dream.



### ***The Ghost of Abel***

B.’s final etched work, dated 1822, responds to Byron’s romantic drama *Cain, A Mystery*, which had appeared in 1821. Byron dwells at length on the despair and the agonized guilt of Cain, and indicts the God responsible for death. If life ends in death, it is meaningless. But B. argues in effect that a poet should see beyond the sufferings of this world: spiritual vision should reveal Eternity, in which there is no death – hence no cause for despair. The central issues in *The Ghost of Abel* are Faith *versus* Doubt and Vengeance for sin *versus* Forgiveness for sin. The central action is that the ghost of Abel, inspired by Satan, demands vengeance, while Jehovah offers the covenant of forgiveness.

Pl. 1.1 *What doest thou here Elijah?* B. addresses Byron in the words of God to Elijah \(1 Kings 19:9, 13\), when the prophet had fled to the wilderness out of fear for his life, and was lapsing into despair. As God commands Elijah to resume his prophetic labours, so, B. implies, should Byron. As a poet, Byron should have faith in ‘Visions of Jehovah’ which are one with his own imagination.

6 *I will not hear thee… Voice* Adam rejects Jehovah, as Albion in the opening of *Jerusalem* rejects Jesus. He refuses to believe in the spiritual, insisting it is ‘delusion’.

8–9 *the Womans Seed… head* From Genesis 3:15, God’s promise to Adam and Eve.

15 *Among the Elohim… I wander* Elohim is the title for the Creator–God in Genesis 1. It is a plural form, implying a polytheistic creation. On Pl. 2 of *The Ghost of Abel*, we find that both Jehovah and Satan are Elohim.

16–17 *Prince of the Air*… *Avenger* Satan \(who appears on Pl. 2\) has entered into Abel, and speaks through him.

P1. 2. 19–20 *that Thou Thyself… Self Annihilation* To go down to eternal death in self-annihilation is the heroic task Milton sets for himself in *M* Pls. 14, 38, 41. Does Jehovah imply that by willingly sacrificing himself on Calvary, he will teach even Satan to do the same, so that Satan too may eventually be redeemed? The Chorus of Angels at the close of the drama suggests that the vengeful Elohim are converted to peace, brotherhood and love.

The design at the foot of the text shows a figure rising from Abel’s body, inscribed ‘The Voice of Abels Blood’.



## ***********Dictionary of Proper Names***





THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION: A Biblical phrase signifying unutterable heathen idols \(Old Testament\) and the ANTICHRIST \(New Testament\).

AHANIA: Athena? The emanation of URIZEN. Idealism, true Wisdom. See FOUR ZOAS; EMANATION.

ALBION: Archaic and poetic name for Great Britain. In B. he is a giant, sometimes England, but usually Mankind or ‘Eternal Man’.

The FOUR ZOAS – his Reason, Passion, Sensation and Instincts – once integrated, divide and war against each other and against him. This Fall is in B. identical with the formation of the created universe. Its effects form the substance of his prophetic books.

ALBION, DAUGHTERS OF: In *VDA*, Englishwomen enslaved by social convention. In *f*, Albion’s twelve daughters typify the ‘female will’, beautiful but cruel. Their names derive from ancient queens and princesses \(except Gwinifred, from the virgin-martyr Winifred\) in Geoffrey of Monmouth’s *Historia Britonum* and Milton’s *History of Britain.* Most are ruthless and ambitious characters. The first five, Cambel \(EMANATION of Hand\), Gwendolen \(Hyle\), Conwenna \(Bowen\), Cordella \(Gwantok\), Ignoge \(Coban\), collectively comprise TIRZAH. The last seven, Gwineverra \(Scofield\), Gwinefred \(Hutton\), Gonorill \(Slade\), Sabrina \(Kotope\), Estrild \(Kox\), Mehetabel \(Peachey\), Ragan \(Brereton\), collectively comprise RAHAB.

ALBION, FRIENDS OF: The twenty-eight cathedral cities of the Church of England \(Edinburgh is included to represent Presbyterian Scotland\), acting as Albion’s conscience. The four chief cities are Canterbury–Verulam, Edinburgh, London and York.

ALBION, SONS OF: Albion’s twelve sons are treacherous rationalist destroyers. They are associated in *f* with figures from Hebrew history. They have modern names, derived from B.’s personal enemies: Hand \(the brothers Hunt, whose *Examiner* editorials – signed with a hand-insignia – ridiculed B. and his art. Hand is the chief son, and at times represents them all\); Hyle \(Hayley, B.’s patron, and *hyle*, Gr. ‘matter’\); Coban or Koban \(not identified\); Guantok or Kwantok \(John Guantock, a judge at B.’s sedition trial\); Peachey \(John Peachey, a judge at B.’s trial\); Brereton \(William Brereton, an assisting justice at B.’s trial\); Slade or Slayd \(not identified\); Hutton \(Lt George Hutton, a soldier involved in B.’s trial\); Scofield \(Private John Scholfield, who accused B. of treason\); Kox \(Private Cock, Scholfield’s friend and fellow-accuser of B.\); Kotope \(not identified\); Bowen \(possibly Thomas Bowen, a Sussex lawyer who might have assisted at B.’s trial\).

ARAM: Biblical son of Cush, grandson of NOAH, ancestor of the Arameans; also a Hebrew name for Syria.

ARISTON: In Herodotus, a Spartan king who stole his bride from his best friend. In B., a ‘king of beauty’ in legendary Atlantis.

ARNON: A Jordanian river which runs through a great gorge into the Dead Sea. In B., the female sexual tract \(Damon, *Dictionary*\), hence a symbol of birth.

ARTHUR: Legendary British king who established the Round Table and the code of chivalry which idealized war and womankind. He was deceived by his queen \(Gwineverra\) and slain in treacherous battle, but is supposed one day to return. He is identified with the northern constellation Boötes, which circles around the Pole Star \(associated with war in B.\).

ASHER: See ISRAEL, SONS OF.

ATLANTIC: The ocean which separates Britain from America. In B. the two were once united in a single golden continent \(ATLANTIC MOUNTAINS or ATLANTIC HILLS\), now flooded and lost like the legendary Atlantis. The sea is ‘the Sea of Time and Space’.



BABEL: City founded by the warrior-monarch Nimrod on the plain of Shinar \(Mesopotamia\). Site of the Tower of Babel.

BABYLON: Capital city of the Babylonian \(Mesopotamian\) Empire, a chief foe of Israel, by which Jerusalem was sacked, her Temple destroyed and the Hebrews taken into captivity. In Christian apocalyptic literature, Babylon, with its luxurious living, stands for Rome, persecutor of Christianity. She is ‘Mystery, Babylon the Great, the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth’ and will be overthrown at the Second Coming. B. also identifies her with Rahab. See MYSTERY; RAHAB.

In B., a dream-world paradise presided over by the moon, and by beautiful comforting females. It is a resting-place from the vigorous life of EDEN \(Eternity\), but too-prolonged rest may lead to ULRO \(Materialism\). For fallen Mankind, Beulah is the way back to Eden: it is the subconscious, and the source of poetry. See EDEN; GENERATION; ULRO.

BEULAH, DAUGHTERS OF: B.’s Muses.

BEULAH, CHURCHES OR HEAVENS OF: The *lower* border of Beulah consists of churches, which to fallen man seem like heavens *above* him. There are three \(brain, heart, loins\); twelve \(Paganism\); or twenty-seven \(official Judeo-Christianity\).

Carved cherubim guard the Ark of God within the Holy of Holies. Embroidered, they adorned the veil of the Temple. Elsewhere, they bear God’s throne or chariot. Ezekiel identifies them with his visionary ‘living creatures’. In Christian literature they become the high angelic order \(Wisdom\) second only to seraphim \(Love\).

In B. cherubim are sometimes angelic spirits and merciful intercessors, sometimes representatives of Pagan or Norse mythology, but most often guardians of Holiness, separating Man from union with the Divine. As sexual symbols the two cherubim which cover the Ark are female labia; the cherubim depicted on the Veil constitute the hymen. See COVERING CHERUB.

CHEVIOT: Hills on the English–Scottish border, location of the war–ballad ‘Chevy Chase’.

See also SHADOW, SPECTRE.

ENION: Anyone? Emanation of THARMAS, Man’s sensation, and power of coherence. In the Fall, as he becomes chaotic Flood, she becomes water vapour, tears and the ‘watery grave’, an aged and helpless Demeter-figure. She is the parent of LOS and ENITHARMON.

FOUR ZOAS: From Gr. Z![image](images/000010.jpg)α, ‘living creatures’. The energies of Mankind, or of any individual man. In Eternity they are integrated as the members of a single divine being.

Each founded one tribe, except for Joseph, who founded two: MANASSEH and EPHRAIM. After the Exodus from Egypt and the conquest of Canaan, each tribe received a portion of land, except for the Levites \(the priest-caste\) who received forty-eight ‘cities of refuge’. After the Babylonian captivity, only two tribes – Judah and Benjamin – returned to the Holy Land; the rest were ‘Lost Tribes’.

In B., the Sons of Jacob–Israel are lost portions of Albion, who erroneously flee him and become incorporated in material bodies.
