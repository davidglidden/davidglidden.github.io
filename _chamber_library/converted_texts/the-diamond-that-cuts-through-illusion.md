[BROTHERS AND SISTERS, please read [The Diamond That Cuts through Illusion]{.italic} with a serene mind, a mind free from views. It's the basic sutra for the practice of meditation. Late at night, it's a pleasure to recite the Diamond Sutra alone, in complete silence. The sutra is so deep and wonderful. It has its own language. The first Western scholars who obtained the text thought it was talking nonsense. Its language seems mysterious, but when you look deeply, you can understand.]{.calibre5}
:::

::: calibre_7
[Don't rush into the commentaries or you may be unduly influenced by them. Please read the sutra first. You may see things that no commentator has seen. You can read as if you were chanting, using your clear body and mind to be in touch with the words. Try to understand the sutra from your own experiences and your own suffering. It is helpful to ask, "Do these teachings of the Buddha have anything to do with my daily life?" Abstract ideas can be beautiful, but if they have nothing to do with our life, of what use are they? So please ask, "Do the words have anything to do with eating a meal, drinking tea, cutting wood, or carrying water?"]{.calibre5}

[The sutra's full name is [The Diamond That Cuts through Illusion]{.italic}, Vajracchedika Prajñaparamita in Sanskrit. [Vajracchedika]{.italic} means "the diamond that cuts through afflictions, ignorance, delusion, or illusion." In China and Vietnam, people generally call it the Diamond Sutra, emphasizing the word "diamond," but, in fact, the phrase "cutting through" is the most important. [Prajñaparamita]{.italic} means "perfection of wisdom," "transcendent understanding," or "the understanding that brings us across the ocean of suffering to the other shore." Studying and practicing this sutra can help us cut through ignorance and wrong views and transcend them, transporting ourselves to the shore of liberation.]{.calibre5}

[That day, when it was time to make the round for alms, the Buddha put on his sanghati robe and, holding his bowl, went into the city of Shravasti to seek alms food, going from house to house. When the almsround was completed, he returned to the monastery to eat the midday meal. Then he put away his sanghati robe and his bowl, washed his feet, arranged his cushion, and sat down.]{.calibre5}

However many species of living beings there are---whether born from eggs, from the womb, from moisture, or spontaneously; whether they have form or do not have form; whether they have perceptions or do not have perceptions; or whether it cannot be said of them that they have perceptions or that they do not have perceptions, we must lead all these beings to the ultimate nirvana so that they can be liberated. And when this innumerable, immeasurable, infinite number of beings has become liberated, we do not, in truth, think that a single being has been liberated.]{.calibre5}

That, Subhuti, is the spirit in which a bodhisattva should practice generosity, not relying on signs. Why? If a bodhisattva practices generosity without relying on signs, the happiness that results cannot be conceived of or measured.

Five hundred years after the Tathagata has passed away, there will still be people who enjoy the happiness that comes from observing the precepts. When such people hear these words, they will have faith and confidence that here is the truth. We should know that such people have sown seeds not only during the lifetime of one Buddha, or even two, three, four, or five Buddhas, but have, in truth, planted wholesome seeds during the lifetimes of tens of thousands of Buddhas. Anyone who, for only a second, gives rise to a pure and clear confidence upon hearing these words of the Tathagata, the Tathagata sees and knows that person, and he or she will attain immeasurable happiness because of this understanding.

If you are caught up in the idea of a dharma, you are also caught up in the ideas of a self, a person, a living being, and a life span. If you are caught up in the idea that there is no dharma, you are still caught up in the ideas of a self, a person, a living being, and a life span. That is why we should not get caught up in dharmas or in the idea that dharmas do not exist. This is the hidden meaning when the Tathagata says, 'Bhikshus, you should know that all of the teachings I give to you are a raft.' All teachings must be abandoned, not to mention non-teachings."]{.calibre5}

Seeking alms food is a way to cultivate nondiscriminating mind and also to be in touch with different classes of people to guide them in the practices taught by the Buddha. Even if a monk knew that the people in a particular house would be unkind and not offer him food, he still had to go there and stand still for a few minutes before moving along to the next house.]{.calibre5}

[Bodhisattvas are compassionate people whose intention is to relieve their own suffering and the suffering of their fellow beings. Just like a young Vietnamese student who always makes the effort to succeed so that he can take care of his parents and siblings who are still in Vietnam, the bodhisattvas practice not only for themselves, but for their families, communities, and the entire society. One Vietnamese college student in Bordeaux has a sign on his desk that says, "I clench my teeth in order to succeed." There are so many temptations and distractions, and he knows that if he is carried away by any of them, he will ruin his parents' hopes and expectations. Because of his firm determination, he is like a bodhisattva and those on the path of practice. When we meet someone like this, compassion wells up in us. We want to help and support him. It is a waste of energy to support those who live only for themselves and forget about others. In the mind and heart of the bodhisattva there exists a great energy called [bodhicitta]{.italic}. This is why the Buddha gives special attention and offers care and support to those with the mind and heart of a bodhisattva, those who have a great vow and a great aspiration. It is not because he is discriminating, but because he knows that it is a good investment. Someone who has a great aspiration can help many people.]{.calibre5}

If we sow healthy seeds in such depleted soil, perhaps a few will sprout, but if we sow the same seeds in the fertile minds of young people whose wounds of war are relatively few, most of them are likely to sprout. This is a good investment. Of course, we should also support the older people, but since our time and energy are limited, sowing seeds in the most fertile land has to be our priority.]{.calibre5}

Subhuti, an elder monk with the title Mahathera, "Great Elder," notices that the Buddha has been paying special attention to the bodhisattvas, and he asks him about it.

The mahasattvas take the great vow to relieve the suffering of all living beings, to bring all to absolute nirvana where they can realize ultimate peace and joy. Absolute nirvana is also called "nirvana without residue of affliction," as compared to nirvana with some residue of afflictions. Some commentators explain that nirvana with some residue of afflictions is a state in which the body of the five aggregates (form, feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness) still exists. They regard the body as a residue of the afflictions of our previous lives. After we die, they say, the body of the five aggregates disintegrates completely, and we enter "nirvana without residue of affliction," leaving no trace behind.]{.calibre5}

[I do not fully agree. It is true that once we put an end to the causes of suffering and transform them, we will not bring about new consequences of suffering in the future. But what has existed for a long time, even after it is cut off, still has momentum and will continue for a while before stopping completely. When an electric fan is switched off, although the current has been cut, the blades keep moving for a while longer. Even after the cause has been cut off, the consequence of this past cause continues for a while. The residue of afflictions is the same. What comes to a stop is the creation of new causes of suffering, not the body of the five aggregates. One day, Devadatta threw a rock at the Buddha, and his foot was wounded. The Buddha was no longer creating new karma, but he experienced this karmic consequence as the result of a past action that had some energy left over before it could stop. This does not mean that the Buddha had not realized complete extinction after he passed away.]{.calibre5}

[The Mahayana sutras say that bodhisattvas ride on the waves of birth and death. Riding on the waves of birth and death means that although birth and death are there, they are not drowned by them. While traveling in the ocean of birth and death, the bodhisattvas are in perfect nirvana, that is, nirvana without any residue of afflictions---not in the imperfect nirvana that has some residue of afflictions. Although their bodies are there and they are riding on birth and death, they do not suffer. Therefore the residues of afflictions in the imperfect nirvana are not the five aggregates themselves, but rather the afflictions that remain as the karmic consequence of past actions.]{.calibre5}

[The World Honored One answers him directly, saying that an authentic bodhisattva is one who embodies two factors in his being: the first is the great aspiration to bring all beings to the shore of liberation; the second is the wisdom of nondiscrimination. This sentence exemplifies the bodhisattva's Great Vow. It is the prerequisite of becoming a bodhisattva, an awakened person, a person for whom the work for enlightenment is his or her life work, a person who is called a great being, a person to whom the Buddha gives special support and attention. This vow is not only the basic condition of being a bodhisattva, it is also the primary condition. It is the foundation of the highest, most fulfilling wish of a bodhisattva.]{.calibre5}

[When we read this passage, we must look at ourselves and ask, "Is this vow at all related to my life and the life of my community? Are we practicing for ourselves or for others? Do we only want to uproot our own afflictions, or is our determination to study and practice to bring happiness to other living beings?" If we look at ourselves, we will see if we are among the bodhisattvas the Buddha is addressing, supporting, and investing in. If we study and practice with a heart like this, we won't have to wait several years for others to notice. They will see it right away by the way we treat the cat, the caterpillar, or the snail. When we wash the dishes, do we put the leftover food aside to feed the birds? These kinds of small acts show our love for all living beings. The great heart of a bodhisattva mahasattva can be seen throughout his or her daily life. While studying the bodhisattva's actions in the Mahayana sutras, we should also practice looking at ourselves---the way we drink tea, eat our food, wash the dishes, or tend our garden.

[This is the first flash of lightning. The Buddha goes directly to the heart of the prajñaparamita, presenting the principle of formlessness. He tells us that a true practitioner helps all living beings in a natural and spontaneous way, without distinguishing between the one who is helping and the one who is being helped. When our left hand is injured, our right hand takes care of it right away. It doesn't stop to say, "I am taking care of you. You are benefiting from my compassion." The right hand knows very well that the left hand is also the right hand. There is no distinction between them. This is the principle of interbeing---coexistence, or mutual interdependence. "This is because that is." With this understanding---the right hand helping the left hand in a formless way---there is no need to distinguish between the right hand and the left hand.]{.calibre5}

[For a bodhisattva, the work of helping is natural, like breathing. When her brother suffers, she offers care and support. She does not think that she has to help him in order to practice the Dharma or because her teacher says she should. It isn't necessary to have an idea of helping. We feel the need to do it, and we do it. This is easy to understand. If we act in this spirit of formlessness, we will not say, later on, "When my brother was sick, I took care of him every day. I made him soup and did many other things for him, and now he is not at all grateful." If we speak like that, our actions were done in the spirit of form. That is not what is called a good deed according to the teaching of prajñaparamita. Formlessness is something concrete that we can put into practice here and now.]{.calibre5}

Why should the absence of one person affect your work so? If, when you are working, you do not distinguish between the person who is doing the work and the one who is not, that is truly the spirit of formlessness.

If we say, for example, that the cosmos has given birth to humankind and that other animals, plants, the moon, the stars, and so forth, exist to serve us, we are caught up in the idea of person.

In many ceremonies, we bow deeply to show our gratitude to our parents, teachers, friends, and numerous beings in the animal, plant, and mineral worlds. Doing this helps us realize that there is no separation between the living and the so-called non-living. Vietnamese composer Trinh Cong Son wrote, "How do we know the stones are not suffering? Tomorrow the pebbles will need one another." When we really understand love, our love will include all beings, living and so-called non-living.]{.calibre5}

[We usually think of "life span" as the length of our life, beginning the moment we are born and ending when we die. We believe that we are alive during that period, not before or after. And while we are alive, we think that everything in us is life, not death. Once again, the sword of conceptualization is cutting reality into pieces, separating one side, life, from the other side, death. But to think that we begin our life at the moment we are born and end it the moment we die is an erroneous view, called the "view of life span."]{.calibre5}

Must we cry and organize a funeral every time one cell of our body or one cell of the Earth's body dies? Death is necessary for life to be. In the Samyutta Nikaya, the Buddha says, "When causes and conditions are sufficient, eyes are present. When causes and conditions are not sufficient, eyes are absent. The same is true of body and consciousness." We love life and grasp it tightly. We dread death and want to hide from it.

The fresh air is so much more pleasant than any bathroom in the city, especially some very smelly public restrooms. But I have to confess that for years I was uneasy about peeing in the woods. The moment I approached a tree, I felt so much respect for its beauty and grandeur that I couldn't bring myself to pee right in front of it. It seemed impolite, even disrespectful.

I realized that peeing is also a marvelous and wondrous reality, our gift to the universe. We only have to pee mindfully, with great respect for ourselves and whatever surroundings we are in. So now I can pee in nature, fully respectful of the trees, the bushes, and myself. Through studying the Diamond Sutra, I solved this dilemma, and I enjoy being in the countryside now more than ever.]{.calibre5}

Any mass of matter, whether rock, iron, or wood, is composed of countless molecules which are, in turn, composed of countless atomic and subatomic particles, all of which are held together by electromagnetic and nuclear forces. Atoms are vast, empty spaces in which infinitely small particles---protons, electrons, neutrons, and so on---are in perpetual motion at enormous speeds. When we look deeply into matter, we see that it is like a beehive moving at a very great speed. Electrons travel around their nucleus at 300,000 kilometers per second. How erroneous was our concept of form! Physicists say that when they enter the world of atomic particles, they can see clearly that our conceptualized world is an illusion. The Buddha uses the image of a bubble to make it clear that there is space in matter, and he says the same is true of sounds, smells, tastes, tactile objects, and objects of mind. Due to our wrong perceptions about these six sense objects, we develop erroneous perceptions of a self, a person, a living being, and a life span. Therefore, while practicing generosity, we must go beyond our wrong perceptions and be free from them, not holding on to anything. If we take refuge in things that collapse easily, we too will collapse easily.]{.calibre5}

[When the Buddha sees a rose, does he recognize it as a rose in the same way that we do? Of course he does. But before he says the rose is a rose, the Buddha has seen that the rose is not a rose. He has seen that it is made of non-rose elements, with no clear demarcation between the rose and those elements that are not the rose. When we perceive things, we generally use the sword of conceptualization to cut reality into pieces, saying, "This piece is A, and A cannot be B, C, or D." But when A is looked at in light of dependent co-arising, we see that A is comprised of B, C, D, and everything else in the universe. "A" can never exist by itself alone. When we look deeply into A, we see B, C, D, and so on. Once we understand that A is not just A, we understand the true nature of A and are qualified to say "A is A," or "A is not A." But until then, the A we see is just an illusion of the true A.]{.calibre5}

"She" includes her education, society, culture, heredity, parents, and all the things that contribute to her being. When we see that, we truly understand her. If she makes us unhappy, we can see that she did not intend to but that unfavorable conditions made her do it. To protect and cultivate the good qualities in her, we need to know how to protect and cultivate the elements outside of her, including ourselves, that make her fresh and lovely. If we are peaceful and pleasant, she too will be peaceful and pleasant.]{.calibre5}

This is the way the Buddha looks at a rose, and it is why he is not attached to the rose. When we are still caught in signs, we are still attached to the rose. A Chinese Zen master once said, "Before practicing Zen, mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers. While practicing Zen, mountains are no longer mountains and rivers are no longer rivers. After practicing, mountains are mountains again and rivers are rivers again." These are the dialectics of prajñaparamita.]{.calibre5}

Their shaved heads, their robes, the way they walk, stand, sit, and lie down, are different from others, and, because of these signs, we can recognize them as monks and nuns. But some monks and nuns practice only for the form, so we cannot pass any judgments, positive or negative, based on signs. We must be able to see through the form in order to be in touch with the substance. Recognizing the Tathagata by means of the thirty-two marks or the eighty signs of beauty is dangerous, because Mara and the Wheel-Turning Kings ([cakravarti-raja]{.italic}) also have the same signs. "Do not look for the Tathagata by means of bodily signs," the Buddha said. He also said, "Where there is sign, there is illusion." That is, when there is perception, there is deception. The substance of any perception is its sign. Our task is to practice until signs no longer deceive us and our perceptions become insight and understanding.]{.calibre5}

If we look into a pebble, a tree, or a child in this way, we also see the Tathagata in them.

The concept of "suchness" exists because we have the concept of "non-suchness." If we think that suchness is different from all other dharmas, our concept of suchness is born from our concept of non-suchness.

[[Chiliocosm]{.italic} comes from two Greek words: [chilioi]{.italic}, meaning "a thousand," and [kosmos]{.italic}, meaning "universe." Three thousand chiliocosms means an innumerable number of universes. The Buddha asks, "If someone were to fill the 3,000 chiliocosms with the seven precious treasures as an act of generosity, would that person bring much happiness by this virtuous act?" Subhuti replies, "Yes," and goes on to show the Buddha that he is not confined by language. Aware that there are no separate objects of mind called "virtue" or "happiness," Subhuti is no longer imprisoned by words and therefore can use them without any harm. But if we do not see the nature of interbeing implied in each word, they can be a kind of attachment or imprisonment. We have to use words in a way that they do not enslave us. This is why the Buddha is giving us The Diamond that Cuts through Illusion.]{.calibre5}

[Those who bring Buddhist practice to the West should do so in this spirit. Since Buddhism is not yet known to most Westerners, the essence of Buddhism won't have much chance to blossom in the West if the teachings emphasize form too much. If you think that the teachings of Buddhism are completely separate from the other teachings in your society, that is a big mistake. When I travel in the West to share the teachings of Buddhism, I often remind people that there are spiritual values in Western culture and tradition---Judaism, Islam, and Christianity---that share the essence of Buddhism. When you look deeply into your culture and tradition, you will discover many beautiful spiritual values. They are not called Buddhadharma, but they are really Buddhadharma in their content.]{.calibre5}

[In his last meal, for example, Jesus held up a piece of bread and shared it with his students, saying, "Friends, eat this bread which is my flesh. I offer it to you." When he poured the wine, he said, "Here is my blood. I offer it to you. Drink it." Many years ago, when I met Cardinal Danielou in Paris, I told him, "I think Lord Jesus was teaching his students the practice of mindfulness." In our life, we eat and drink many times a day, but while doing so, our mind is usually wandering elsewhere, and what we really eat are our worries, thoughts, and anxieties. Eating in mindfulness is to be in touch with life. Jesus spoke the way he did so that his students would [really]{.italic} eat the bread. The Last Supper was a mindfulness meal. If the disciples could pierce through their distractions and eat one piece of bread in the present moment with their whole being, isn't that Buddhadharma? Words like "mindfulness" or "meditation" may not have been used, but the fact that thirteen people were sitting and eating together in mindfulness is surely the practice of Buddhism. Vietnamese King Tran Nhan Tong once said that eating a meal, drinking water, and using the toilet are all Buddhadharma. Buddhadharma is not something different from so-called non-Buddhadharma.]{.calibre5}

It also may seem repetitive, but if you read it carefully, you will find something new in every sentence. Moreover, the Diamond Sutra helps us sow many wholesome seeds into our consciousness, so when a similar thought is repeated, good seeds are sown into our store consciousness ([alaya vijñana]{.italic}). In teaching the Diamond Sutra, the Buddha is training Subhuti how to use the language of nonattachment.

Because Subhuti is not caught by the idea that he has attained the fruit of Arhatship, he is truly an Arhat. At Plum Village, we eat vegetarian food without thinking of ourselves as vegetarians.

According to the Prajñaparamita (known as the "Mother of all Buddhas") Sutras, prajñaparamita is the clay pot that contains all the other paramitas. If the clay has not been fired properly, liquids stored in it will gradually leak out. That is why prajñaparamita is the very foundation. The Buddha was able to practice transcendent endurance because he had attained transcendent understanding, prajñaparamita.]{.calibre5}

If the bodhisattva had still been caught up in views, he would have had ill-will against the king and would not have succeeded.]{.calibre5}

It is, at the same time, transcendent generosity and observing the precepts, as well as everything else that is not transcendent endurance. Just as a rose is not just a rose, transcendent endurance cannot exist independently of the other five paramitas. With this understanding, we can call it transcendent endurance. As we begin to follow the Buddha's reasoning, we can see why he talks about transcendent endurance in order to teach about prajñaparamita, transcendent understanding.]{.calibre5}

Before Vietnamese Dhyana master Van Hanh passed away, he asked his disciples, "Where do you abide, my students? I abide in neither abiding nor non-abiding." A mind that abides in anything, ultimately, cannot have peace. That is why the Buddha often tells the bodhisattvas not to rely on form to practice generosity.

If we say that other objects of mind are deceptive but that suchness is not deceptive, that too is a mistake.

Those who bring Buddhism to the West should understand this well. They should be able to go into the world of Western culture and see many values of the West as elements of Buddhadharma. Drug addiction, alcoholism, and sexual misconduct are ruining the lives of many young people, but we can look deeply and see into their true nature, we can transform them into Buddhadharma.

This means that the Buddha has a profound understanding of the mind. The mind here includes the mind understood by contemporary psychology as well as the roots and nature of all psychological phenomena, which are not conditioned by the birth and death of psychological phenomena.]{.calibre5}

[Modern psychology only studies psychological phenomena at their surface level. In Buddhism, the study of the mind begins at the roots, so the Buddha sees both the phenomenal aspect of the different mentalities and also their true nature.

While going through difficult moments in life, if we contemplate the Buddha with the thirty-two marks, we feel fresh and relaxed. The Diamond Sutra does not tell us not to do that. It just teaches us to look more deeply and to also meditate on the Buddha outside of the thirty-two marks. The Buddha will suffocate if we grasp him too firmly. One Zen master stopped using the word "Buddha" because people overused the word so. He told his community, "From now on, every time I use the word 'Buddha,' I will go to the river and wash my mouth out three times." His statement is completely in accord with the dialectics of prajñaparamita, but when people heard his words, they thought he was being disrespectful. Only one honored guest in the community understood. He stood up and said, "Venerable sir, I deeply appreciate your words. Every time I hear you say the word 'Buddha,' I will have to go to the river and wash out my ears three times." How wonderful! Both men were free of empty words.

Because of that, they may want to eliminate these four ideas from reality. In this section, the Buddha gives us an antidote to that kind of dualistic thinking. He says that all dharmas---including self, person, living being, life span, nonself, non-person, non-living being, and non-life span---are concepts. We should not let go of one set of concepts just to be caught by another. The idea of nonself is born from the idea of self, just as a rose needs non-rose elements in order to exist.]{.calibre5}

If the highest, most fulfilled, awakened mind is empty, then the ideas of self, person, living being, and life span are also empty. So why should we discriminate or be afraid of them? All concepts are dharmas, objects of mind, signs. The Buddha tells us that whenever there is a sign, there is deception.

[OFTEN PEOPLE ASK ME how the teachings in the Diamond Sutra relate to our everyday lives and the current environmental crisis. I have learned the lesson of patience. Sometimes things and people need a lot of time for transformation. The important thing is to be planting good seeds. Sometimes a seed needs one hundred years to bloom as a flower. As I see it, the Diamond Sutra is a seed planted by the Buddha that is now beginning to blossom. The Diamond Sutra is the most ancient text on deep ecology. It is the basic Buddhist teaching on the art of protecting ourselves and protecting the environment.]{.calibre5}

[When the Venerable Subhuti asks the Buddha: "If good women and good men want to give rise to the highest awakened mind, what should they rely on, and what should they do to master their thinking?" He is asking, "If I want to use my whole being to protect life, what methods and principles should I use?" This is a very practical question that we are all struggling with today. How do we protect our health, the health of our loved ones, and the health of our planet?]{.calibre5}
:::

::: calibre_7
[The Buddha's answer to Subhuti's question is very direct: "We have to do our best to help every living being cross the ocean of suffering." Then he continues, "But if a bodhisattva holds onto the idea that a self, a person, a living being, a life span exists, that person is not an authentic bodhisattva." The essence of the Diamond Sutra is in this sentence. If we can understand this sentence about nondiscrimination then we can understand how to use the Diamond Sutra in our daily lives. It's like splitting bamboo; only the first part is difficult. Once we've made a crack, then the whole length of bamboo can be split easily. If we can understand this key sentence, understanding everything else in the sutra will come easily.]{.calibre5}

[An authentic bodhisattva is someone who embodies two elements: the great aspiration to bring all beings to the shore of liberation, and the wisdom of nondiscrimination. The Diamond Sutra teaches us that there is no distinction between the one who saves and the living beings who are saved. This is a wonderful lesson for many who care about the environment! We don't take care of it out of any moral righteousness, but because there's no distinction between us and the plants, animals, and other sentient beings on the planet. The wisdom of nondiscrimination, [samatajñana]{.italic}, is the wisdom that breaks the barrier of individualism. We have to learn to look at the world in this way.]{.calibre5}

[All the media around us encourage us to focus on ourselves. What is self? It is our imagining. The barrier between self and nonself is created by deluded mind. How do we remove that barrier and liberate ourselves from the notion of self? The Buddha advises us to meditate on the nonself nature of things. Whenever we look at a leaf, a pebble, a cloud, a river, a baby, a society, or a human being, we look deeply into it to see its nonself nature, so we can liberate ourselves from the notion of self. The meditation on nonself needs to be practiced every day, in every moment of our daily lives. Whether we're eating, walking, sitting, working in the garden, whenever we look at other people, the clouds, the grass, we see that we are in those elements and those elements are in us; we are not separate.]{.calibre5}
:::

::: calibre_7
[We often forget that the human being is a creature that evolved from animals, plants, and minerals and that humans appeared only recently in the evolution of life on Earth. When we think we have the right to do anything we want, and that other animals, plants, and minerals are only the means for us to get what we want, then we have a very wrong notion about what it is to be a human being. We haven't understood that humans are made of non-human elements; that is the true nature of the human being. We need to remove the barrier between human beings and the non-human elements: animals, plants, and minerals. We know that human beings cannot survive without animals, plants, and minerals, yet we continue to discriminate and to destroy them, the elements of our environment.]{.calibre5}
:::

::: calibre_7
[In our daily life, we can practice mindfulness in order to understand the relationship between the human and non-human. If we can protect the non-human elements, including the non-living beings, then we protect ourselves. We think of living beings as having feelings, perceptions, and so on, and that in this way they're different from non-living beings. But living beings are made of so-called non-living beings---of plants and minerals. We need to live our daily life in a way that nourishes our understanding of the relationship between living and non-living beings. As human beings are made of non-human elements, so living beings are made of non-living beings.]{.calibre5}
:::

::: calibre_7
[Part of our misperception about how to help protect living and non-living beings comes out of the way we look at our own lives. We think our life span is seventy, eighty, or one hundred years. We think that we exist from the time we're born to the time we die, and that this is our life span. We think that before we're born we don't exist, and that after we die we're nothing. This is a very wrong notion. We have a great fear of being cut off from life, we have a fear of nothingness.]{.calibre5}
:::

::: calibre_7
[The notion of life span has to be removed in order for us to see that reality is free from all notions, including the notions of birth and death, being and nonbeing, and so on. The notion of life span is the basis for all the other notions. So if we look deeply into life span, we discover that this is only a manifestation. If we get caught in our perception, in the form, then we miss the whole thing. We're not seeing reality as it is: free from birth and death, coming and going, same and different. Our life span is not limited by time.]{.calibre5}

The leaf becomes the soil to later on become another leaf or a flower. We are like the leaf. We have to look deeply at being young, being old, being born, dying, coming, going, being, nonbeing, so we can see that all of these are just notions.]{.calibre5}

The Chinese characters for "mark" and "perception" are closely connected because "mark" is the object of perception, and "perception" in turn is the subject of "mark"; so we have a perception when our mind is grasping a mark. In Sanskrit object of mind is [lakshana]{.italic}, and mind is [citta]{.italic}. When those two are combined we have the word [samjña]{.italic}, notion or perception.]{.calibre5}
