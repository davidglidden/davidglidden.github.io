In the first years of the 1990s, my mother toyed desultorily with the idea of writing an autobiography. Since she was someone who had always preferred to write as little as possible about herself directly, this surprised me. "To write mainly about myself," she once told an interviewer in [The Boston Review]{.i}, "seems to me a rather indirect route to what I want to write about ... I have never been convinced that my tastes, my fortunes and misfortunes have any particularly exemplary character."
:::

<span>
My mother said this in 1975, when she was still in the midst of undergoing a cruelly severe regimen of chemotherapy that the doctors hoped would, but, as at least one of them told me at the time, did not really expect to, grant her a long remission, let alone cure, the metastatic, stage-4 breast cancer she had been diagnosed with the previous year (this was still the era when the family members of ill people were told more than the patients themselves). Characteristically, once she was able to write again, she chose to write the series of essays for [The New York Review of Books]{.i} that would later be published in book form as [On Photography]{.i}. Not only is she all but wholly absent in any autobiographical sense from that work, she barely appears even in [Illness as Metaphor]{.i}, a book she would certainly never have written had it not been for her experience
<?dp n="12" folio="viii" ?>
of the stigmatization that came with cancer in those days and, while it has lessened, still exists today, usually in the form of self-stigmatization.`</span>`{=html}
:::

::: p-indent
I can think of only four occasions when she was straightforwardly autobiographical as a writer. The first is her short story "Project for a Trip to China," published in 1973 on the eve of her first visit there. In large measure, the piece is a meditation on her own childhood and on her father, a businessman who spent most of his woefully short adult life in China, and who died there when my mother (who never accompanied her parents to the British concession in what is now called Tianjin, instead being looked after in New York and New Jersey by relatives and her nanny) was four. The second is the short story "Unguided Tour," published in [The New Yorker]{.i} in 1977. The third is "Pilgrimage," published in 1987, also in [The New Yorker]{.i}. It is a memoir of a visit she'd paid as an adolescent in Los Angeles in 1947 to Thomas Mann, then living in exile in Pacific Palisades. But "Pilgrimage" is first and foremost an exercise in admiration for the writer my mother had then admired above all others; characteristically, the self-portrait comes in a distant second. It was an encounter, as she wrote, of "an embarrassed, fervid, literature-intoxicated child and a god in exile." Lastly, there are the autobiographical passages at the end of my mother's third novel, [The Volcano Lover]{.i}, published in 1992, where she speaks directly, and in a way she never did either in her published work or even in interviews, about being a woman, and a few glancing childhood reminiscences in her last novel, [In America]{.i}, published in 2000.
:::

::: p-indent
<span>
"My life is my capital, the capital of my imagination," she told that same [Boston Review]{.i} interviewer, adding that she liked to "colonize" it. It was a curious, and uncharacteristic, turn of phrase for my mother, who was profoundly uninterested in money, and whom I can never remember ever using a financial metaphor in private conversation. And yet it also
<?dp n="13" folio="ix" ?>
seems to me an entirely accurate description of her way of being a writer. It was also why I was so surprised that she would even consider writing an autobiography, which, for her, to continue the capitalist analogies, would have been not to live off the fruits, the proceeds of one's capital, but rather to dip into it---the height of unreason, be the capital in question money or material for novels, stories, and essays.`</span>`{=html}
:::

::: p-indent
In the end, nothing came of the idea. My mother wrote [The Volcano Lover]{.i}, and, in doing so, felt she had made the return to being a novelist that had been her ambition even when she was writing her best essays. The success of the book gave her a confidence she herself conceded she had lacked since her second novel, [Death Kit]{.i}, had been published in 1967 to very mixed reviews that had bitterly disappointed her. And after [The Volcano Lover]{.i} came my mother's long engagement with Bosnia and with besieged Sarajevo---eventually an all-consuming passion for her. After that, she returned to fiction, with no further mention, as far as I am aware, anyway, of a memoir.
:::

::: p-indent
<span>
In my more extravagant moments, I sometimes think that my mother's journals, of which this is the second of three volumes, are not just the autobiography she never got around to writing (had she done so, I imagine something highly literary and episodic, a cousin to John Updike's [Self-Consciousness]{.i}, which was a book she admired greatly), but the great autobiographical novel she never cared to write. To pursue the conceit along its conventional trajectory, the first volume of the journals, [Reborn]{.i}, would be the bildungsroman, the education novel---her [Buddenbrooks]{.i}, to cite Mann's great achievement, or, on a lesser literary plane, her [Martin Eden]{.i}, a novel by Jack London that my mother read as an adolescent and spoke of with fondness until the end of her life. This current volume, which I have chosen to call [As Consciousness Is Harnessed to Flesh]{.i}, a line plucked from one of the journal entries contained
<?dp n="14" folio="x" ?>
within it, would be the novel of vigorous, successful adulthood. About the third and final volume, I will not speak for now.`</span>`{=html}
:::

::: p-indent
The problem with this account is that my mother, by her own proud and fervent admission, was a student her entire life. Of course, in [Reborn]{.i}, the very young Susan Sontag was quite consciously creating, or, rather, re-creating herself as, the person she wanted to be, far from the world in which she was born and in which she grew up. This volume does not involve the physical leaving of the southern Arizona and Los Angeles of her childhood for the University of Chicago, Paris, New York, and fulfillment (emphatically not happiness, which is something altogether different and, I fear, was not a well from which my mother ever was able to drink deeply). But the great success as a writer that my mother chronicles in this volume, the company of writers, artists, and intellectuals of every cast and persuasion---from Lionel Trilling to Paul Bowles, Jasper Johns to Joseph Brodsky, and Peter Brook to György Konrád---and the ability to travel anywhere, virtually at will, which had been her most cherished dream as a child, did not make her less of a student. If anything, it made her more of one.
:::

::: p-indent
<span>
For me, one of the most striking things about this volume is the way in which my mother moves between different worlds. Some of this had to do with her deep ambivalence, and with contradictions in her thought that, to me, far from diminishing it, in fact makes it deeper, more interesting, and, in an ultimate sense, quite resistant to ... well, to interpretation. But a more important element, I think, is that while my mother was not exactly known for suffering fools gladly (and her definition of fool was, to say the least, ecumenical), with people she genuinely admired she became not the teacher she liked to be so much of the time but rather the student. That is why for me the strongest parts of [As Consciousness Is Harnessed to Flesh]{.i} are its exercises in admiration---of many people,
<?dp n="15" folio="xi" ?>
but perhaps most poignantly, and in their very different ways, of Jasper Johns and of Joseph Brodsky. To read these passages is, indeed, to better understand those of my mother's essays---I think particularly of those on Walter Benjamin, on Roland Barthes, and on Elias Canetti---that were themselves first and foremost acts of homage.`</span>`{=html}
:::

::: p-indent
I like to think that this volume can also be fairly called a political bildungsroman, precisely in the sense of a person's education, her coming to maturity. In the early parts of the book, my mother is at once angry and overwhelmed by the follies of the American war in Vietnam, against which she became a prominent activist. I think even she, in retrospect, would have winced at some of the things she said during her visits to Hanoi under U.S. bombardment. I have included them without hesitation, though, just as I have included many other entries on diverse subjects that either worry me for her sake or cause me pain of my own. Where Vietnam is concerned, I will only add that the horrors of war that made her go off to an extreme were anything but figments of her imagination. She may have been unwise, but the war was still the unspeakable monstrosity she thought it was at the time.
:::

::: p-indent
<span>
My mother never recanted her opposition to the war. But she did come to regret, and, unlike so many of her peers (I will be discreet here, but the discerning reader will know the American writers of my mother's generation to whom I refer), to publicly recant, her faith in the emancipatory possibilities of Communism, not just in its Soviet, Chinese, or Cuban incarnations, but as a system. I cannot say for certain whether she would have had this change of both heart and mind had it not been for her profound relationship with Joseph Brodsky---perhaps the only sentimental relation of equals that she had in her entire life. Brodsky's importance to her, despite their estrangement during the last period of his life, cannot be overstated, whether aesthetically, politically, or humanly.
<?dp n="16" folio="xii" ?>
On her deathbed in Memorial Hospital in New York, on the penultimate day of her life, as she gasped for air, for life, and the headlines were full of Asian tsunamis, she spoke of only two people---her mother and Joseph Brodsky. To paraphrase Byron, his heart was her tribunal.`</span>`{=html}
:::

::: p-indent
Her heart was one often broken, and much of this volume is the elaboration of romantic loss. In a sense, that means it gives a false impression of my mother's life in that she tended to write more in her journals when she was unhappy, most when she was bitterly unhappy, and least when she was all right. But while the proportions may not be quite right, I think her unhappiness in love was as much a part of her as was the profound sense of fulfillment she derived from her writing, and the passion she brought, particularly when she was not writing something, to her life as a perpetual student, as a kind of ideal reader of great literature, and ideal appreciator of great art, an ideal spectator of great theater, film, and music. And so, true to herself, that is, to her life as she lived it, the journals move from loss to erudition, and then back again. That it was not the life I would have wished for her is neither here nor there.

  One fears him---fears being thought clumsy, ill-bred, low-class (that's his power)   One believes he knows the secret of fun---doesn't want to be thought a bore by him

  Admits he's evil                                                                     Hurts you---then makes you laugh. Shameless, but denies his own evil. Acts like a naughty, adorable child.

I was Gulliver in Lilliput + in Brobdingnag at the same time. They were too strong for me and I was too strong for them. I would protect them from me. I was from Krypton, but I would be meek, mild-mannered Clark Kent. I would smile, I would be "nice" ... And politics came into it---was that a supporting cause, or a product of the unhappy consciousness? I felt guilty because I was more "fortunate" than others (Becky: the ditch digger ex--high school classmate I spotted on the canyon as I was driving to UCLA in Mother's Pontiac).

\[Arthur\] Schopenhauer the first imp\[ortant\] writer to talk about boredom (in his [Essays]{.i})---ranks it with "pain" as one of the twin evils of life (pain for have-nots, boredom for haves---it's a question of affluence).

Boredom is a function of attention. We are learning new modes of attention---say, favoring the ear more than the
<?dp n="161" folio="145" ?>
eye---but so long as we work within the old attention-frame we find X boring ... e.g. listening for sense rather than sound (being too message-oriented). Possibly after repetition of the same single phrase or level of language or image for a long while---in a given written text or piece of music or film, if we become bored, we should ask if we are operating in the right frame of attention. Or---maybe we are operating in [one]{.i} right frame, where we should be operating in two simultaneously, thus halving the load on each (as sense [and]{.i} sound).`</span>`{=html}

The situation in painting is tight: like science. Everyone conscious of "problems," what needs to be worked on.

Thus, \[[the American art critic]{.i}\] Rosalind Krauss judges Jasper's flashlight, ale cans, to be the exploration / solution to a peripheral (trivial) problem of sculpture now: what to do with the pedestal (vs the object), Jasper's solution being to make it sculptural---etc. While Frank Stella's work is thought to be very interesting because it is a solution to central problems.

[Morbidity]{.i}: The aestheticizing of death. Cf. the ossuary of the catacombs of Paris (which David + I visited this morning). Death is "arranged" for the spectator. Mottoes, reflections, admonitions, stone plaques on the walls between the huge packages of stacked bones. No single interpretation of death or message to the spectator---but an anthology of contradictory sentiments.

Foucault \[[from]{.i} Madness and Civilization[, translated by Richard Howard]{.i}\]: "Madness is no longer the space of indecision through which it was possible to glimpse the original truth of the work of art, but the decision beyond which this truth ceases irrevocably ... Madness is the absolute break with the work of art; it forms the constitutive moment of abolition, which dissolves in time the truth of the work of art; it draws the exterior edge, the line of dissolution, the contour against the void."

Acting (theatre) vs being a star (movies). Movies have specialized (though not exclusively) in actors whose appeal lies in the [continuity]{.i} of character, manner, appearance from one role to another. Garbo, \[Douglas\] Fairbanks, Bogart. Fritz Rasp \[[the German film star who played in Fritz Lang's]{.i} Metropolis\]. Garbo is Garbo, only secondarily acts a character. Characters, roles are pretexts which both obscure and reveal the star. Theatre has gloried in the absence of the actor. Someone like Olivier or Guinness, or Irene Worth, or Robert Stephens---almost totally changed, unrecognizable from one role to the next. Acting as impersonation, the actor as chameleon.

... Cocteau says: Primitives make beautiful things because they've never seen any others. Analogous to what I did as a child. I started thinking using my mind, because I'd never seen anyone do it. I didn't think anyone had a mind except in the Pantheon (mostly dead, foreign)---Mme. Curie, Shakespeare, Mann, etc. Everyone else was like my mother, Rosie, Judith. If I'd known about the middle ground---all the intelligent, thoughtful, sensitive people, who knows? I might never have gone on + on + on with my mind.

I tried hardest with Irene. But I found out it was hopeless: what I thought of (code) as her incapacity for "nobility." Then the relationship became a lie. I had to reduce myself to just the psychological (the case-history) me to get what she had to give. The case-history me was absolutely authentic---what a relief, a blessing it was to express it---I had kept up so many lies on that front for so long. But it wasn't all of me. I knew all the time there was a transcendental ego that had survived alongside the damaged ego of my childhood that became enslaved to Irene's ministrations---and that ego Irene couldn't understand, or join, or love.

The "contract" Eva made with her mother---she was the earthy, sensitive, creative one; while Eva had more brains, cleverness. But then her father cut her down there.

If a child feels the parent wants to do him in, he gets news of a hostile persecuting universe from which he must [defend]{.i} himself---also must placate the parent---also must deal with his own rage and sense of impotence. Ultimately the child has no ego but what is confirmed by the parents; if they don't love you it must be because they think you're bad, you must be---they can't be wrong. So you think you're bad but you hate them anyway for not loving you---which produces guilt, because they're good. So you start to punish yourself, which reduces the feeling of hate (some of it is now turned against
<?dp n="226" folio="210" ?>
yourself, siding with them) + makes it possible to love them more---personal love.`</span>`{=html}

::: p
In Eva's case, the hallucinatory "other world" always breaking in on this one (in fantasies, flash hallucinations) is:
:::

\

:::::: blocktext
::: p-indent-inverse-blocktext
A symbolic statement, an iconography, of her hostile judgments of people around her (originally the parents)

A form of self-punishment---she "haunts" herself or has herself haunted---for these bad feelings
:::

::: p-indent-inverse-blocktext

:::
::::::

\

::: p
The hallucinatory images must have originated from an experience of her parents as persecutory, demonic---she "caricatures" them; these images are a form of wit---but then was extended or generalized to the whole world, so that a tree or a shadow or a chair can become a monster. But one couldn't have a [primary]{.i} experience of the whole world (the perceptual field) as demonic. First persons. Indeed, first of a part of a person---the mother's breast.

Seeing parts of a body (a form of flash-hallucination, the Brobdingnagian vision) is a form of aggression, as Vera \[[Eva's psychotherapist]{.i}\] said to her. She caricatures the person by dismembering him, reducing him, putting him in his place; also scaring herself, giving herself license for anxiety, self-contempt, withdrawal. Simultaneously she disarms the
<?dp n="227" folio="211" ?>
person and makes him more threatening than before. A microcosm of the vision she must have turned on her parents---`</span>`{=html}
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
The generalization of hallucinations about persons to the whole world of things also serves a double purpose:
:::

\

::::: blocktext
::: p-indent-inverse-blocktext
It dilutes the accusation against her parents---it's not just them, it's the whole world
:::

::: p-indent-inverse-blocktext
It steps up the self-punishment, the cost to her in sense of wholeness.
:::
:::::

\

::: p
Thereby, reducing guilt. She is less guilty because she doesn't accuse them [that]{.i} much, or single them out. (She does it other people, to things, etc.) And because she suffers more.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
But the generalized need to suffer remains. The price of that original hatred of them never seems to be paid off. Hence, masochistic fantasies---which also fit into a more specifically sexual pattern whereby one needs to feel forced---to feel one has no [choice]{.i}---in order to allow sexual sensation.
:::

::: p-blanc

::: p
Earlier, she told me, the principal weapon of self defense was mockery. Could never say anything "straight." Fear of rejection, "betrayal." If I show you my true feelings, you won't love me \[[there's a question mark in the margin]{.i}\]---you'll mock me---reject my gift. So I'll beat you to it. I'll mock you.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
A kind of braininess---but at the same time, one that she would mistrust. Experiencing her mind mainly as a means of aggression, as a weapon turned against other people, she w\[oul\]d want to get rid of her mind. Becoming mindless becomes equated with the ability (the freedom) to love. Hence, Gert. (Becoming a "real woman," etc.)

Joan gave Eva enough love to permit her to dare to speak "straight"---w\[ith\]o\[ut\] mockery.

Hence, Joan told Eva she'd make a human being out of her. And Eva acknowledged that to be true. And still somewhere fears to break with Joan, as if the license to be human might be revoked then. (Magical thinking which plays only a [part]{.i} in her tie to Joan, but shouldn't be discounted.)

I've always been "hiding behind my eyes." (Lillian Kesler saw this last year at Richard + Sandy's. \[[SS's friends, the poet and translator Richard Howard, to whom she remained close throughout her life, and his then partner, the novelist Sanford Friedman]{.i}.\]) Because I wanted to see but for it not to be known how much I see---the others will hold it against me---and not to tell what I see, at least only part of it.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
But why will they hold it against me? Because they'd know I'm seeing past them---at my most benevolent, still locating them in a scheme I believe I can (or do) transcend; and, often, seeing their failures, their weaknesses. Shriveling them up---to a dried out piece of bacon (my dream about my mother) or a tiny well-done meatball.

<span>
But this isn't all---or I do myself (the self I've been up to now) an injustice. I also see, I have an awful gift for seeing people's unhappiness. A talent I developed as a child with my
<?dp n="229" folio="213" ?>
mother. She invited it, of course. It was a way of getting my love, which probably wasn't, in the circumstances, readily forthcoming. She showed me her misery + weakness. I pitied her---and it gave me a reason to love her (a means, the imperative I sought) to transcend and suppress my hatred of and resentment toward her. But it also made me---underneath---despise her, and despise myself. It created an unbridgeable distance between us. I would adore her and pity her and exercise my empathic powers upon her and forbear to burden such a weak vessel with [my]{.i} needs and [my]{.i} anger. I would be kind, I would be generous. But I also became her superior. I was the stronger. I had needs, but was strong enough not to ask or expect her (or anyone else) to satisfy them. And, with my own needs unsatisfied, except by myself, I could even try to satisfy hers. So I also was patronizing her---much as I feared her anger (living in constant terror that she would withdraw suddenly + arbitrarily from this bargain, calling in even the shoddy semblance of reliable affection for me it guaranteed). I also scorned her. And so, in a perverse way, I was the willing accomplice in a relation with her in which she was satisfying a subsequent need of mine. What became a very powerful need---to become strong; to feel, to know myself (whatever the outward appearance, the cringing, the thralldoms) stronger than "the others."`</span>`{=html}
:::

::: p-blanc

:::

::: p
So I grew up trying both to see + not to see. Trying to use up as much of my intellectual energy, my energy for seeing, on things "outside." Ideas, art, politics, science, culture. And for the rest, seeing people, trying to mediate between those two problematic (but still seductive) ways of seeing.

Irene's advent into my life was the great turning point. She introduced me to an idea deeply foreign to me---how incredible it seems now!---that of seeing [myself]{.i}. I thought my mind was only to see outside myself! Because I didn't exist in the sense that others + everything else did. Everything else was an "object," but how could I be an object to myself? Etc. etc.

Could I never have thought I was seen by anyone else before in my whole life? No, I didn't. But how could I have been so resigned? When did I give up hoping anyone would see me? It must have been terribly early. (All those radical disruptions: Mrs. Enright leaving after 6 mo\[nth\]s, then Rosie, my parents coming + going, Rosie leaving when I was 4 or 5, then my father's death, summer camp, my mother's absences, being sent to Verona \[[SS's maternal grandfather's house in Verona, New Jersey]{.i}\].)

And shortly after I must have started hiding, making sure they [couldn't]{.i} see me. (The nailbiting started at camp, the asthma the next winter.)

That scaling down, that mashing, was just a question of my being clever and "perceptive" enough. To see what they wanted. To see what they could bear.

But how could I have known or decided that I was "more" than they---all centered on my fabulous, cosmic voyaging mind? Even if it were true that potentially I had such a mind (but how [could]{.i} I have?) how would I have known? And how did I dare stake out such a claim for myself? With no support or stimulation or help from anyone? It seems like madness---that claim, and the steps I took to be worthy of it. (The Nobel Prize fantasy, the search for the appropriate vessel for my ambition.) And all the while searching for reconciliation with the others---to be loved, to be taken care of. But certainly I was acting in bad faith. (Wisely, I suppose.) If they didn't come across, I always had my ambition, my mind, my secret being, my knowledge of my destiny to sustain me. So I was hedging my bets. If they came across, well + good. (But I certainly wasn't going to give up the most important thing, my mind, to get their love.)

I mustn't underestimate, though, what I did give up---while faithfully guarding my "real" self as I understood it. I gave up, first of all, my sexuality. I gave up my ability to understand myself as an "ordinary" person; I gave up most of the ordinary range of access to myself, to my feelings. I gave up my self-confidence, my self-esteem in personal relations---particularly with men.\* I gave up being at home in my body.

From which I can infer a lot about my first five years. Obviously neither my mother nor Rosie were out to get me, to break my spirit, to give me a bad opinion of myself. Nobody made fun of me or made me feel stupid or ugly or clumsy. They made me feel that the world was mechanical, usually polite (though sometimes incomprehensibly irascible), and incredibly obtuse and [stupid]{.i} people who, I must have thought, couldn't be that stupid if they wouldn't be so lazy or distracted or undermotivated. They could be intelligent, they could see, if they tried. But nobody wanted to try. They seemed so sluggish, so inert---and so predictable in most of their responses. Their touch was bony + insensuous + badly-timed (like my mother) or oppressive + too heavy + suffocating (like Rosie). So the lesson was: stay away from bodies. Maybe find someone to talk to. Thus, my early hallucination about the family of little people in the sewer pipe who were my friends.

I never "fantasize" in Eva's sense. She told me how she couldn't bear to have all those images around her---looking at her. They would always be coming alive. They would be an "invasion." For me, they're reinforcements! They're on my team; or rather, I am (hope to be) on theirs. They're my models. They guard me from despair, from feeling there's nothing better in the world than what I see, nothing better than me! They don't come alive, they don't talk to each other or look at me: they aren't, can't in any way be aware of me, much less judge me, conspire against me, etc. They're just pictures of people far away I don't know.

My ultimate project: to keep her afloat, alive. My means: flattery, unlimited statements of how much I admire and adore her, and repeated rituals of denigration of my own worth.

To keep her alive I also have to amuse her, to distract her from a full knowledge of her misery. (Like a parent dangling a bauble before a child about to start bawling.)

she cares how she is for "others"---so much that she gives so much time to washing, making up, dressing, etc. I feel [superior]{.i} to her because I'm entirely indifferent to these things---and vow I always will be when I'm grown up. I'm going to be an entirely different kind of woman. I despise her for the pleasure she takes in my admiration. She doesn't see me. Doesn't she see I [want]{.i} something from her?

And later on---in my teens---I come to feel more divided about my mother still being beautiful, still looking so much younger than her chronological age.

But if I'm afraid of my mother, she is also afraid of me. On a more specific level, afraid of my judgment. Afraid I will find her stupid, uncultivated (hiding [Redbook]{.i} under the bedcovers when I came in to kiss her goodnight), glamorous, morally deficient.

My feeling of being "seconds."

And the mystery of her giving most of it up in the last four years. Calling the system into question? But how can one (she) give it up?

I start manufacturing + delivering my buckets of guilt---as penance, as restitution, as a way of placating her. But she won't be appeased. (For a while, the lure that she might come back to me if I was guilty "enough," proving that I took [all]{.i} the responsibility on myself, that I had gained "nothing" by our exchange in the way of self-confidence, self-affirmation.)

Bedroom, large bathroom, bar with dance floor, restaurant, terrace, swimming pool, maybe a golf course. Going back + forth between these places, which are close together. The continual guaranteed presence of "service," the situation of being [served]{.i}. Absolving her of the pressure of the demand to be more energetic, autonomous; to do for herself---+ others (like me). What is laziness or indolence at home doesn't count as that in a resort hotel. Also, the bland neutralized genteel kinds of contacts you have in a hotel. The system of decorum which is "given"; she doesn't have to ask for it, to create it, to be continually anxious about its being violated. She knows how to behave; presumably the others know how to behave, too, or they wouldn't (wouldn't dare) be here; they've signed a contract to behave, as it were, before they checked in. A process of self-selection; elimination of riffraff.

If the outside corresponded to the inner life in people, we couldn't have "bodies" as we do. The inner life is too complex, too various, too fluid. Our bodies incarnate only a fraction of our inner lives. (The legitimate basis for the paranoid endless anxiety about what's "behind" the appearances.) Given that they would still [have]{.i} inner lives of the energy + complexity that they have now, the bodies of people would have to be more like gas---something gaseous yet tangible-looking like clouds. Then our bodies could metamorphose rapidly, expand, contract---a part could break off, we could fragment, fuse, collide, accumulate, vanish, rematerialize, swell up, thin out, thicken, etc. etc. As it is, we're stuck with a soft but still largely determinate (especially determinate with regard to size + dimension + shape) material presence in the world---almost wholly inadequate to these processes which then become "inner" processes. (i.e., far from wholly manifested, needing to be discovered, inferred; capable of being hidden, etc.) Our bodies become vessels, then---and masks. Since we can't expand + contract (our bodies), we stiffen them a lot---inscribe tension on them. Which becomes a

habit---becomes installed, to then re-influence the "inner life." The phenomenon of character armor that \[[the Austrian psychologist Wilhelm]{.i}\] Reich focused on.`</span>`{=html}

Of course, maybe we wouldn't have so much subjectivity if the "outer" were better designed to register the interior life.

Over-arching the whole question of the "first self" versus the "second self" (my new being, into which Irene initiated me)
<?dp n="251" folio="235" ?>
was the larger framework: the visionary [self]{.i} was [never]{.i} questioned. The issue on which I involved myself with Irene was "only" that of what concrete style of consciousness. Somewhere, partly knowing it and partly not, I was cheating. I was going to, I intended to "use" her knowledge as she could never use it (absence of "nobility," etc.) as she could [never]{.i} put it to use. I had a (larger---) framework in which to situate her wisdom. So I apprenticed myself to her---wholeheartedly, true. Even when I came to realize it meant humiliating myself, rendering up my mind, pronouncing it incompetent + shallow + death-ridden + no instrument for proper life---I did all that, not without struggle but in the end, I did it.

I felt my consciousness included theirs, or could---but theirs could never include mine. And I thought with despair that I was lost to what I most admired. My consciousness is too complex, it has known too great a variety of pleasures. I thought of the motto of \[[the 1964 Bernardo]{.i}\] Bertolucci film \[[Before the Revolution]{.i}\]---"He who has not lived before the revolution has never tasted the sweetness of life"---and mentioned it to Andy \[[the American writer and activist Andrew Kopkind]{.i}\].

More than hopeless. An ordeal. Of course, I was not sorry I had come. It was a duty---a political act, a piece of political theatre. They were playing their role. We (I) must play ours (mine). The heaviness of it all was due to the fact that the script was entirely written by them; and they were directing the play, too. There was no question in my mind that this was as it should be. But my acts appeared as nothing other than dutiful. And inwardly I was very sad.

The strongly hierarchical features of this society strike me immediately, and displease. No one is in the least servile, but many people know their place. I evoke the populist manners of the Cuban revolution. The deference I see given to some people by others is always gracious and graceful. But there is clearly the feeling that some people are more important (valuable) than others, and deserve a bigger share of the few comforts available. Like the store for foreigners (diplomatic personnel, guests) and important government people to which we were taken the third day to buy pants and tire sandals. Our guides told us this was a special store quite proudly, without shame. I thought they should see that the existence of such facilities was uncommunist.

It exasperates me that we are taken quite short distances by car---two cars, in fact---big, ugly, black Volgas that are waiting with their drivers in front of the hotel whenever we are supposed to go somewhere. Why don't they let us---ask us---to walk? Better yet, they should insist that we walk. Is it because of politeness? (Only the best for the guests.) But [that]{.i} kind of politeness, it seems to me, could well be abolished in a communist society. Or because they think we're weak, effete foreigners? (Westerners? Americans?) It horrifies me to think they might regard our walking as beneath our dignity (as important people, official guests, celebrities, or whatever). There's no budging them on this. We roll through the bicycle-crammed streets in our big black cars---the chauffeur blasting away on his horn to make people on foot and on bicycles watch out, often give way.

What would be best, of course, is if they would give us bicycles. But it's clear they can't possibly take that request seriously. Are they at least amused? Do they think we're being silly or impolite or dumb or what when we broach it?

Wherever we go in Hanoi people stare, often gape. I find that very pleasant, I don't know exactly why. It's not a particularly friendly stare, but I feel they are "enjoying" us, that it's a pleasant experience for them to see us. I asked Oanh if he thought many people would see that we are Americans. He said this wouldn't occur to many people. Then who do they think we are, I asked. Probably Russians, he said. And indeed, a couple of times people said "tovarich" and some other Russian words at us ... Mostly, though, people don't say anything to us at all. They stare calmly, they point, they discuss us with their neighbors. Hien says the thing about us that is most frequently said is how tall we are. With good-natured amazement.

The monochromatic version of Vietnamese history that is recited to us again and again. Three thousand years of repelling foreign aggressors. The present extended backward in time. The Americans = the French colonialists = the Japanese (briefly) = millennia of "Northern feudalists"---read "Chinese." There was even a Tet offensive in the \[[thirteenth century]{.i}\]. The great sea battle on the Bach Dang river in 1288 is related as another version of the victory over the French at Dien Bien Phu.

I see now that my pattern of association with male homosexuals has one more, very important meaning than those I've already understood (de-sexualizing myself; having male company---which I long for---that's still safe, not threatening, etc.). It also means the roundabout recovery or preservation of my femininity! Everything "feminine" is "en principe" \[["in principle"]{.i}\] poisoned for me by my mother. If she even [would]{.i} ... do it, I don't want to do it. If she liked it, I can't like it. That includes everything from men to perfume, attractive furniture, stylish clothes, make-up, fancy or ornate things, soft lines, curves, flowers, colors, going to the beauty parlor, and having vacations in the sun!

Poor me. But I've rather cleverly found a back door to some of those things by becoming close to a series of men who admire and imitate "feminine" things. I accept that in them. (They---not women, not my mother---validate it.) Therefore, I can accept it in myself. And so in the last decade I have gradually been adding more "feminine" things, tastes, + activities in my life. I can love "art nouveau" (all curves, opalescent glass, insane flowers). I can enjoy flowers. I love to dance. I love beautiful clothes. I want to (well, in my head I do, though
<?dp n="272" folio="256" ?>
in fact I don't!) go to and give parties. I want a beautiful apartment with stunning furniture. I \[enjoy\] wearing bright colors.`</span>`{=html}

::: p
How different I was until eleven years ago (through the end of my marriage): no flowers, no colors (my clothes were just black, grey, + brown material to hide in---to cover up as much of myself as I could), no lightness of any kind. The only good was work, study, my intellectual + moral ambitions, becoming "strong" (because my mother is "weak").
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
So, as I suddenly saw this morning---it was just waking up in the hotel here, picking up an already read issue of [La Quin-zaine Littéraire]{.i}, glancing at a review of the new \[Carlos\] Fuentes novel, reading a description of a woman character who collects "art nouveau"---my involvement with the male homosexual world in the last eleven years isn't just something bad for me, a neurotic symptom, a retreat, a defense against the emergence of my own sexuality + full maturity. It's also been---given my initial problems---something very positive. I've been helped by it---though I think I've gotten all I can from that unconscious strategy by now, and it's of no [further]{.i} use to me. Because I can be more genuinely a woman (but still strong, still autonomous, still an adult) more genuinely than any man can!

Another mini-thought. When I had this idea (me with a new idea!) this morning in bed, I was so delighted at having a new thought---it's been so damned long! I've been sure this year that my mind was shot to hell, + I was becoming just as stupid as everybody else---I wanted to do something to express my pleasure. So I spoke out loud, rather self-consciously: "Well, what do you know. An idea!" Or something like that. And the sound of my voice in this room with nobody but me here profoundly depressed me.

Maybe that's why I write---in a journal. That feels "right." I know I'm alone, that I'm the only reader of what I write here---but the knowledge isn't painful, on the contrary I feel [stronger]{.i} for it, stronger each time I write something down. (Hence, my worry this past year---I felt myself terribly [weakened]{.i} by the fact that I couldn't write in the journal, didn't want to, was blocked, or whatever.) I can't talk to myself, but I can write to myself.

Ivan Illich \[[the Austrian Catholic social critic, whom SS met in the late 1960s]{.i}\] mentioned what a radical transformation would be wrought in a society if one passed one simple law: that nothing within the borders of the country could move faster than 30 m.p.h.

I haven't so many alternatives as I thought---in fact, only two: uproot the feeling, tell her \[Carlotta\] to go to hell---or jouer le jeu \[["play the game"]{.i}\].

This is not the end of the story---only the beginning of Phase Three.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
Phase One was July--August: passion, hope, longing. Phase Two dates from my return to New York on Sept. 2 until this last week in Paris: intensified longing, obsession, suffering, paralysis in work, magical chastity, innocence (still), joy at the feeling of being loved, being patient waiting for our life together to begin.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
Now Phase Three. The time of playing the game. Carlotta cannot be the center of my life, only (possibly) part of a plural center that will include work, friends, other affairs. I must allow her her liberty to be with me when she wants to and then go away again. I must learn to use, and genuinely enjoy, the liberty that such a situation allows me.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
I must appear to be strong---which means that I really must be strong. I must not offer her my suffering, my longing for her, as a proof of my love. I must not even tell her so often that I love her. I must not try to persuade her, with words, that it will be good for her to be with me. (This awakens her fear of dependence.) I must not ask her to reassure me, to tell me she loves me. I must not ask her when she is coming to New York, only \[say\] that I hope she will come.
:::

<?dp n="279" folio="263" ?>

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
Above all, I must not act as if what has happened this week is decisive (to ask her to reassure me that it is decisive). Nothing is decisive for her. But if I ask her to tell me that it isn't, she will feel cornered---as if she is being asked for a commitment.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
I must show that I am interested in (get pleasure from) my work, David, my friends. If I deny them for her, that is a sign of weakness---and she feels threatened. (For me, of course, it is a sign of strength---and evidence of my love.)
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
I must be strong, permissive, unreproachful, capable of joy (independently of her), able to take care of my own needs (but playing down my ability, or wish, to take care of hers). Remember what she said the other day about finding me so different from the way I appeared at first (autonomous, "cool")? It was that person she was originally attracted to. She must still sense that in me from time to time. I cannot ever show her all my weakness. I must limit my thirst for candor.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
I cannot persuade her with words to love me, to trust me, to be with me. It must be done with actions. She must come to me freely. I must act as if I expect her to do that---but not say it, above all not ask her to confirm it. I must act as if ten days with her is as good as ten months.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
I can tell her that I feel stronger (in myself, in my love for her) because of this past week---but not that "we" are stronger. That's already a demand for commitment.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
I must not ask her to ask me to wait for her, to be patient, to have hope. I must simply show that I am, in fact, doing these things---without anxiety, without too much suffering.

Conversation with Eva \[Berliner\]:
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
The meaning of Carlotta's "collapse" this past week: You see, I would if I could, but I can't. For the behavior to be effective (i.e. self-exonerating) the collapse must be "total," which excludes even the slightest gesture of consolation or reassurance to me. For if she could make such a gesture, that would mean she was capable of concern for me (of feeling a sense of responsibility) and therefore that the collapse was not total, and if not total then demands could conceivably be made on her, etc. (That, not sadism---conscious or unconscious---explains why she couldn't give the smallest reassurance those last days.)
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
What I have to get over: the idea that the value of love rises as the self dwindles. What Carlotta doesn't want---should anyone want it?---is that I'm prepared to give up (disvalue) every-thing for her. What she was attracted to in me was that I was a person with interests, success, strength.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
A bad lesson I learned from Irene, who did want me to give up everything for her, and did measure my love by the amount I was willing to give up.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
The state that Carlotta was in last week: she has no "I." "It" was making her do things. That's her problem: not having a real "I." That is, hating herself. That is, believing that she's a killer---that she's fundamentally bad for people. (Hence, the meaninglessness of the notion of "responsibility" for a person without an "I.") But no person can give Carlotta an "I." Even if one could, it would feel threatening to her. A person who can give you an "I" can also take it away.

Eva said: I would be afraid of someone who was willing to give up everything for me.

Carlotta wants from me, first, the show of strength---the reassurance that she can't destroy me. That, at this moment, much more than my reassurance that I still love her.

Carlotta would never say of an action of hers that it was a "mistake," because she doesn't see herself as acting on the basis of judgment made of calculations---but only on the basis of feelings and capabilities. Feelings can't be a mistake. Something she's done can be bad---or sad---but not a mistake. ---I often speak of actions I've performed as mistakes because I assume an element of conscious judgment, evaluation (is this efficacious? What are its long-range consequences?) enters, properly so, into my decisive actions.

Carlotta not locked into an ambivalence problem---as Eva has often been.

One of the strongest psychic factors in Beatrice's favor: C. feels grateful to her, indebted to her---for feeling more "well" in the past four years. Apparently, she is. Beatrice must really

Being in love (l'amour fou \[["crazy love"]{.i}\]) a pathological variant of loving. Being in love = addiction, obsession, exclusion of others, insatiable demand for presence, paralysis of other interests and activities. A disease of love, a fever (therefore exalting). One "falls" in love. But this is one disease which, if one must have it, is better to have often rather than infrequently. It's less mad to fall in love often (less inaccurate for there are many wonderful people in the world) than only two

Kleist (Puppet Theater): If you don't have your center of gravity within yourself, you have it somewhere else (in another person?) which sets up infinite possibilities of distortion. Carlotta's ambivalence---(unlike Eva) she doesn't project it on to persons (she's too gentle, too affectionate, essentially too uncritical of people) but she feels the profoundest ambivalence toward herself. Experiences herself as a deeply dependent person, and despises herself for that.

Importance, to C., of the notion of being "civilized." Being civilized means having self-control, being able to be gay and friendly when you feel despair. The ability to laugh on the phone with an acquaintance in the midst of great private suffering is "civilized" to her---dissociated and anxiety-provoking to me. \[Being civilized\] means keeping things separate---different states of being with people, different states of self-manifestation and self-revelation---with the standard of being pleasant for people to be with.

C. has become the first big intellectual event (this past week) since my trip to Hanoi. And \[calls my\] consciousness into question. As my trip to Hanoi made me re-appraise my identity, the forms of my consciousness, the psychic forms of my culture, the meaning of "sincerity," language, moral decision, psychological expressiveness, etc., so the trip to Paris---pain, loss, abandonment, the advent of anguish + insecurity---has made me re-appraise almost everything about the forms of my thinking and feeling. A shaft boring into my consciousness---deeper and deeper (as I talk to Don, Stephen, Eva---especially Don)---"the seminar." I feel a big gain in wisdom, in perceptiveness---if not in emotional maturity. The last 8 days have been like a year's worth of work with Diana. Better, richer in some ways than the psychoanalytic dialogue---this home analysis with friends---because I can analyze the cultural (Jewish, American, psychoanalytic, etc.) forms of my consciousness, not just their sources in my individual psycho-biography.

I feel a sense of mastery, amid all the pain and anguish at being abandoned. A breakthrough of intelligence like this---perceptions not only verbalized, but spun out into a long, searching, open-ended discourse---makes me know I'm alive and growing. It's almost as great a source of vitality---of feeling palpably the sense of life in me---as being in love. I feel once again, and I rejoice, that I'm not busy dying---I'm still busy being born.

C. doesn't see herself as the product of her history, but the vehicle of her nature. For me, I am the product of my history. That's all my "nature" amounts to---And since I understand how arbitrary, in part, my history is---its result, my nature, logically seems modifiable, transcendable.

Psychoanalytic thinking sensitizes one to the contingent quality of the self---as the product of a history that is contingent, rather than the expression of a nature that is given. It persuades us that we are being "passive" if we merely accept our selves ... Hence, the essential optimism of this culture. Psychoanalysis took root here, as it did nowhere in Europe, because it supports the feasibility of "the pursuit of happiness."

Carlotta is profoundly pessimistic about love, human relations, the possibility of happiness. Ultimately---whatever my melancholy and despair---I'm not.

I love C. just as much as ever, but my love is no longer innocent---and it never will be again. That makes me very sad---I feel an enormous sense of loss right there, quite apart from my anxiety that in the end I will lose her. But it was inevitable, I suppose; in the end, maybe better. Carlotta would have to be so exceptionally whole and sane to have not created situations which would have destroyed the innocence of my feeling for her. And that is too much to ask of her---of anyone.

It's no accident that I fall in love for the first time in so many years a year before David and I are separated. He's been too important to me in the last six years really to give myself to anyone. He's been safety, refuge; wall; security in being needed, and loved, and necessary, literally and morally. A relationship that needed no justification---self-justifying, fully functional, and limited. But no accident, too, that I've fallen in love with someone who invites me to exercise my parental talents, now losing the object on which they've been exercised (with David's growing up). To be "with" Carlotta even some of the time---I can no longer imagine living with her all the time, and I think I can settle for less (maybe it would prove to be better for me that way, not just better for her)---would still make great demands on my ability to give unselfishly, generously, undemandingly---to find my pleasure in pleasing her, my happiness in making her happy---to be permissive and strong. The sense in which C. plays the role of child with any lover is that one can't expect to be given to, to be supported, to be reassured by her. She offers her (unreliable) presence---the beauty of her person; her charm; her vitality; her pathos; her wit and intelligence. But she makes no promises (loyalty, fidelity, reliability, practical assistance)---about that she is extremely scrupulous and honest. It's other people, those who love her, who make promises to her. (Everyone who has loved Carlotta must have understood at least that much from the beginning.) And she tells them that she will not be surprised, or reproachful, if they can't keep the promises they make (or change their minds). She always thinks they are promising too much---and that she isn't worthy of their donation of self, and that they will, must ultimately become disappointed in her.

Carlotta is exceptionally free of rage, anger, rancor, hostility. She is a profoundly gentle person. I love this in her. (It reminds me of myself.) But this must be one reason for her terribly
<?dp n="293" folio="277" ?>
self-destructive history. She's rarely known how to defend herself, except by withdrawal (tuning out, running away). How come she never developed even a normal capacity for hostility? This can only be explained by things in her childhood. Too much insecurity to allow anger. But if there's no anger experienced, one feels so vulnerable---anxiety must then mount to intolerable levels. Thus, already at eighteen, she had to seek the extreme recourse of heroin to disconnect herself from the anxiety. (As she once told me, if she hadn't taken heroin, she would have committed suicide.)`</span>`{=html}

Can I love non-possessively, permissively---without withdrawing myself, setting up my own defenses and strategic retreats, on the one hand, or reducing the amount and intensity of my love, on the other? I would like to try, with Carlotta. Not just because I am so completely in love with her that I have no choice but to try anything that's possible---though that's true. But also because it might be very good for me. I have such strong tendencies to abandon myself to someone with whom I'm in love---to want to give up every-thing, to be possessed totally as well as to possess totally. What I envisage as perhaps possible with Carlotta is the contradiction of my symbiotic, Siamese-twin marriages in the past. I might have learned to love fully (as I really never have done) and to remain autonomous and be able to be alone without anguish---at the same time. That would be a tremendous victory, a great change in what C. would call my "nature" (but which I stubbornly insist on believing is less than that).

I feel inauthentic at a party: Protestant-Jewish demand for unremitting "seriousness." Going to a party is a "low" activity---the authentic self is compromised, fragmented---one plays "roles." One isn't fully present, beyond role-playing. One doesn't (can't) tell the full truth, which means one is lying, even if one doesn't literally tell lies.

Carlotta has no share in this type of consciousness (typically Puritan). The convivium has its value, and standards of presence appropriate to itself. The fulfilling of these standards means one is "civilized." There is no guilt attached to the situation of being at a party as such for her, as there is for me. Rather, perhaps, some guilt attaches to unsociability, being uncompanionable. The lies, or partial truth-telling, that sociability requires are part of civiltà. No inner demand for complete authenticity in Catholic culture.

Mine is a second-class, truncated Puritanism. Parties depress me (I feel demeaned) while I don't usually feel depressed, corrupted, or demeaned if I go to a bad movie or play. As long as I am a spectator, a voyeur (however much response I may have inside) I haven't essentially violated or demeaned myself. I draw the line between participation and voyeurism. The only parties I go to where I feel clear (and usually not depressed) are those in which I behave like a spectator---the party becomes a movie---and I discuss it with the person I came with or the one person I already know who is there; and regard meeting new people as an intrusion on my essential
<?dp n="295" folio="279" ?>
activity. Or else I use the party as décor, backdrop to be in a different way privately with the person I came with (as when I used to go to parties with Irene, or go to parties to dance with Paul \[Thek\]).`</span>`{=html}

I don't feel guilt at being unsociable, though I may sometimes regret it because my loneliness is painful. But when I move into the world, it feels like a moral fall---like seeking love in a whorehouse. Even more, I somewhere take my unsociability as evidence of my "seriousness," a quality which I take as necessary to my existence as a moral being. What a strange set of assumptions, as I now see by comparing them with those of Carlotta. Carlotta never seeks to establish, to herself or to others, that she is "serious." Indeed, the concept hardly makes sense to her. She has always been faintly amused (and, I suppose, somewhere alarmed) when I told her---as, God help me, I have repeatedly---that my love for her is "serious," that I'm a "serious" person. Now I see, for the first time, how it must seem funny to her.

For C., emotions---actions---are. Their quality and duration become self-evident. There's no need for advance certification of them as "serious," or for that kind of retrospective appraisal. It must seem to her like some pretentious, pointless kind of rhetoric.

Bigger gap for C. than for me between emotions and actions. I often use "will," the ethical ought, to make the jump. If you don't have the idea of laying down that kind of bridge (and pushing yourself across), it must be much easier to be indecisive.

Carlotta---Southern European, Catholic culture---uses the convivium (parties, dinners, etc.) to tune out. Protestant-Jewish culture uses work. One is allowed to tune out on the full authentic private self in work---in the fulfillment of the routines of a vocation, a profession, a job---because work itself is a moral imperative: satisfying the requirements of the discipline of the self and the necessity to relate communally to others. Work is experienced as discipline---the background of which is ascesis---even though it also gives pleasure. One is allowed to become "depersonalized" in work, to forget the self (to lose contact with its most intimate feelings and needs)---indeed all that is necessary if one is to give oneself fully to the work. The party and other forms of convivium are, of course, not at all ascetic---on the contrary. The depersonalization is hedonistic, non-utilitarian, not moralized.

Carlotta never asks herself if she has behaved "authentically," never scrutinizes herself to see if her actions really correspond to her feelings, never despairs of being in touch with her "real" feelings. She experiences her problem not as one of knowing what she really feels, but of living with---and not being torn to pieces by---the (contradictory) feelings she has.

psychologically, only as complex, contradictory, and sinful. Carlotta doesn't experience her self as alienated (hidden) from herself, but rather as contradictory to the point of being almost intolerable. It's the problem of co-existence (peaceful co-existence) with her self that she hasn't solved, not the problem of contact with herself, which is what I feel is my problem (and task).`</span>`{=html}

I see life as a set of projects / tasks. C. doesn't. This makes it much easier for me to make decisions, or at least to conclude that a decision must be made (and then force myself to take one---even if I have to invent it). Obviously, my set of mind corresponds much more to the conditions under which work in the world is performed. And everyone knows that much more work gets done in Protestant than in Catholic countries. This view is obviously exacerbated in a woman in a Catholic country---because there are strong positive pressures on every girl which discourage the mental set that creates a capacity to work. Intellectual skills, except those involving the development of sensibility, are not encouraged in girls. Executive or administrative force is disparaged as "aggressive," castrating, unbecoming, unfeminine. Women are encouraged to work, not only in Catholic countries but everywhere, only in situations where they take orders---or perform thoroughly routine tasks (as in housework). To be creative or to direct an enterprise, in a woman, is by cultural definition, aggressive. For a woman to function as an autonomous, independent, decision-making being is, by cultural definition, unfeminine---even though the culture allows, and even flatters, a small number of exceptional women who defy the prohibition and function this way anyway. So Carlotta's set \[of mind\] with respect to will, action, decision-making is not only furnished by her culture, but is heavily compounded by the fact of being a woman.

Women have traditionally represented the "Southern" values, men the Northern values---within any given country. Women are easier, softer, more amiable, less responsible, less intellectual, less serious about work, more spontaneous, more sensuous (though not more sexual---sexuality remains part of the masculine domain of will, force, decision-making, taking the initiative, exercising control, anticipatory behavior).

Simple (too simple?) thesis: the very burden of the project distracts---eventually cuts oneself off, promotes dissociation from---one's feelings. I conceive my life linearly, as a series of projects. Plans, the exercise of will, skill in judgment, and good instincts in decision-making make it possible for me to move along the line of my life, moving from one project to the next. In all this, is it any wonder that feelings---still, in my case (even in my old, most benighted days) a powerful motivating force in the choice and execution of every project---could get a little lost.
:::

<span>
Carlotta has never conceived of her life as a series of projects---life is not a line, or a highway---it's basically a group of free-standing events. Those events are basically discussable separately. They can be compared with each other, and each can be understood as a reflection of (at least some partial aspect of) something all her actions share---as their underpinning---her "nature." Her actions all illustrate her nature. She discovers her nature through her actions. Indeed, she uses her actions to discover her nature---her actions, and her capacity for a particular action. Thus, she discovered her feeling about going to New York---the extent of her panic, fear of me, guilt toward Beatrice, etc., etc.---by her inability to leave Paris with me for New York. But there is no notion of a "key" action, more important and more self-revelatory than the others
<?dp n="299" folio="283" ?>
(even of a group of key actions). Hence, in a sense, no one action is irrevocable---or irrevocably self-defining. Thus, she doesn't define herself as brave---because of the action by which she freed herself of heroin. She doesn't (and this is my strongest source of hope) define our relationship as over because she abandoned us (our plans) and backed out of coming to New York.`</span>`{=html}

She doesn't draw conclusions---in a general way---from her actions, though they do, of course, tell her the state of particular feelings and capacities at a specific time. This produces her belief in the openness (and unpredictability) of the future.

I know the future is open and unpredictable. My style, though, is to want to close it---to make it predictable---at least the immediate future (3 months, 6 months, a year) or the longer future with respect to my most intimate relations. A completely open, unpredictable future makes me horribly anxious. I can't imagine how I will function (because I assume functioning in an effective, creative---not blundering---way entails making plans). Of course, I'm fairly confident that I could function somehow---but on a lower level---even if I have no certainties before me. But it has never really occurred to me, I now realize, that this is anything but an undesirable (and, in the case of love, extremely painful and destructive) limitation. It's as if I'm supposed to walk through a forest without being allowed to inform myself whether or not it's full of wolves. Sure, I'll cross the forest anyway---but it seems just stupid, a pointless risk, that I wasn't allowed to inform myself first, when I know the information is available.

So much more inventive. So easily convinced that if "this" doesn't work out, something else will---that there's always "more." Just what I don't feel about people---whether friends or lovers.

I relate my actions to each other. (I'm doing it now.) I draw conclusions from my actions, not just retrospectively, but at the time I perform them. I generalize from them easily.

Carlotta tends to particularize. Her generalizations are weak, vague (being "weak," "decadent," "dependent") and don't truly adhere to---or flow from a considered estimate of---her actions. Her generalizations aren't really thoughts as much as abstract words used as tokens of states of feeling. The abstract words are, notably, almost all put-downs of herself. (They are symptoms of when she's not feeling "well.") And when her state of feeling shifts---her feelings are very mobile---the use of the words (and the conviction) behind them shifts, fades.

I've operated with the unconscious aim of trying to lock my feelings into place.

This is one of the things I mean when I assure C. my love for her is "serious"---that it's locked into place, that it isn't going to change (I guarantee myself).

That's the neurotic side. Another, healthy reason is my (unconscious, life-long) idea of a life of multiple projects, many levels of activity. If something---ideally, my most important private relations---are nailed down, reliable, I'm free to turn my attention to other things: mainly work, but also friends.

Carlotta doesn't want to promise herself. The very thought of that arouses thoughts of being trapped with another person, becoming dependent, losing her liberty. Of course, she also wants to be safe somewhere. But she can only accept safety in a situation with a person where she can often test it, challenge it, refuse it.---C.'s problem is that she can't imagine safety as

:::

And C. doesn't have any notion of being safe with someone one loves in order to be freer (from anxiety, from love-starvation) to do something else specifically, to fulfill one's projects. (I'm sure Beatrice knows about this.) Once again, she doesn't have any projects. There is no activity of a public nature---except perhaps the creation of her personal appearance: her clothes, etc.---in which she feels herself competent, or even imagines that she typically, self-indulgently, irresponsibly becomes competent. Her lack of self-love, of self-esteem is so great that she probably wouldn't consider valuable any activity in which she was competent---and, certainly, it prevents her from trying responsibly to gain competence in any activity she does admire.

Back to the earlier point: for Carlotta, knowing her own feelings is not, at any given moment, an essential problem. It can become a problem, though, if she's asked to put her feelings into words---quite rightly, in a way---she feels when she talks about her feelings she is violating herself, because extended talk about or description of states of feelings always carries the taint, or temptation, of generalization. Talk about feelings itself locks feelings into place (at least it appears to do that). Her problem is not the identification of---or contact with---her feelings, but what to do about them---which of the several actions they could prompt she could take. She usually sees several possibilities of action, because she experiences her feelings as multiple, divided. The problem is easier only when action is experienced as a demand from outside her private life---Ken \[[the fashion designer Ken Scott, whom Carlotta worked for intermittently]{.i}\] expected her to do the show on Jan. 20---or from a sphere of her private life
<?dp n="303" folio="287" ?>
when she has explicitly placed responsibility over feeling---her mother wants her to come to Ischia for 10 days in August.`</span>`{=html}
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
Since the problem is the selection among several feelings for the performance of an action, every action she performs is, au fond, tentative. She often hesitates before she does it---and while she's doing it she experiences waves of doubt as to whether it's right or whether she can go on with it (thereby increasing her sense of herself as weak, psychologically frail, vulnerable). Actions don't easily seem real---at least not until she's been doing them for a long time. Which is why, as she told me, she doesn't really love someone---fully believe in the reality of a love relationship---until at least a year of being "with" the person (in some form) has passed. She de-realizes her behavior by this sense of tentativeness, reversibility, contingency, arbitrariness of everything she does---and since situations only become real to her after a long time (perhaps never fully so) she has the space---of incomplete commitment, so to speak---to behave destructively, unreliably, erratically, self-indulgently, irresponsibly.

Thereby she tests her own commitments to the action or the situation with the person---if it survives these tests, it deserves to (survival of the fittest); if it doesn't, it wasn't right. But thereby also she increases her burden of self-hatred, because somewhere she does know she behaves destructively with people she loves.

It must be partly because this burden of self-reproach and self-condemnation is so great that she views the events of her life mainly as "free-standing." The causal tissue between
<?dp n="304" folio="288" ?>
events, in C.'s view, is very thin. As much as possible, she minimizes it. It would probably be intolerable for her, as she is now, to see how many connections there are between the things she does. Bearing the whole (could she apprehend herself as a whole---intuitively or through the exercise of discursive intelligence)---herself as the sum of her parts---would be even more painful than bearing herself as a collection of disparaging epithets, loosely used, plus the separate parts.`</span>`{=html}

Carlotta has a problem "bearing" herself at all. Therefore, she has an investment in a certain degree of inaccuracy---what she's doing when, her word, she "exaggerates" (e.g. "I'm desperate," "I wish I could disappear")---her feelings. Also a big investment in the ability to tune out---pleasures of the convivium, dolce vita, even the kind of chatter Beatrice provides which carefully skirts all real questions of feeling. (Those gay twice-daily phone calls to Milan in July + August.) Exaggeration---inaccuracy---obscure the exact contours of the burden of the self. Distraction temporarily suppresses the awareness of it.

How different from my procedures! I have found lucidity---and accuracy to the point of pedantry---offer me the only possibility I know of making some contact with my feelings.

She finds that I lack a sense of humor, that I'm too literal-minded. I've agreed about that with her---and yet I know it's not true, or at least it's much more complicated. The explanation, of course, is that different problems---different anxieties---are at stake when I talk than when she talks. She's not hooked on talk as a creative dialogue, as I am.

The other procedure---finding distractions, tuning out---is also foreign to me. Of course, I can and do do it sometimes, but never without feeling I'm violating myself. If my health depends on my knowing---experiencing---my full intimate self, escaping into a "social" self feels simply bad. What I want is not to tune out, because the bad situation I started from was feeling tuned out.

I'm chasing myself (I have been for years). Now I'm chasing Carlotta, too. She's running away from confronting herself. She's running away from me.---This is, of course, the gloomiest way I can summarize the situation. It's much more than this.

I've told C. she can help me---being connected with her makes me grow, makes me more alive. These 4 pages I've written in the past few days are the concrete proof. I wish she could read them.

Do I want to show what I've written because I think it would be good for her (help her feel better in herself) or because I want to force upon her the evidence of the fruitfulness and value (to me) of my love for her. Both, of course. But mainly
<?dp n="306" folio="290" ?>
the latter---which is why I must be very suspicious of this wish. It's self-serving: I imagine if she knew how much I'd gained from loving her, she would love herself more. Of course, I want that. But \[in\] the end don't I want her to love herself more than she can love me?`</span>`{=html}

A lot of what I've written in criticism of my lust for virtue---my discovery that I've committed idolatry, making of the good an idol---is open to the charge of being still caught within the dialectic of idolatry. I've made a moral criticism of my moral consciousness. Meta-idolatry.

A similar charge could be made about my ideas of comparative consciousness re: Carlotta and me. I feel as if I've discovered the limits of my own unspontaneous, will-driven, decision-craving, anticipatory, linear, discourse-dependent style of feeling and acting. I profess to see the advantages (spiritual, psychological, practical) and validity of Carlotta's consciousness. (Stripped of its neurotic motivations and backlash of self-destructiveness, it offers an equally complete way of seeing things and of functioning in the world.) I profess to have detected the ravages of reason in myself. But am I not over-powering with the labor of reason the glimpse I've had of a more organic, less problematic, less consciousness-laden view of the world? The elements of Carlotta's view of the world I've sounded out exist in these pages only as packaged by my reason. It sounds as if I were not just proposing one more project for myself.

It's all a question of really feeling inside myself, so I don't always worry that I should get out, go behind, and push. And I must abandon the standards of efficiency (efficacity) in action. It's not necessary that an action necessarily leads to what one understands as a "result." If I were more inside my feelings---a whole range of feelings, not just my love for Carlotta---I wouldn't be so interested in results anyway. I wouldn't have the psychic room, at least not as much. I'd experience my feelings in a more imperative form, and satisfying them by acting on them would be a bigger, more gratifying experience---so that I wouldn't think so much about "what's going to happen after" (or "next") and I wouldn't even care so much if later consequences were, indeed, displeasing or frustrating to me.

Is Carlotta angry? Certainly, she must have had an awful childhood---though she knows consciously NOTHING about it---otherwise she wouldn't be as she is, wouldn't have started taking heroin at 18, etc. Only clue she has given me is when she said, "I feel about my mother as if she were my daughter"---she who is every lover's child! No wonder she fears separation from her mother---needs to visit her often (though only briefly): it's the one relationship in which she feels more adult. (To a lesser degree, she feels more adult than Giovanella \[

My early childhood decision, "By God, they won't get me!" (absolute decision to survive, not to be done in) was executed principally \[[next to this word, in the margin:]{.i} "No??"\] in terms of my talent for emotional dissociation, for turning off feelings before they made me intolerably unhappy or confused---through doing things, being interested in other things. There's more to the world than just me, etc. Thus, one of the healthiest things about me---my capacity to "take it," to survive, to bounce back, to do, to prosper---is intimately connected with my biggest neurotic liability: my facility in disconnecting from my feelings. How to preserve the first while diminishing the second? It's hard. A risk. Did Diana know this?

Most people think (1) is the key to rhythm, but this isn't so. Duration of shot is too subjective---depends on lecture, readability of a shot.

Is it possible I owe yet a second liberation to Simone de Beauvoir? Twenty years ago, I read [The Second Sex]{.i}. Last night, I read [L'Invitée]{.i}. No, of course. I still have much to live through to free myself. But, for the first time, I was able to laugh. Change the class (most important), age (20 years more experience!), country, and physique of Xavière, and it is a perfect portrait of C\[arlotta\]. I see the entrapment from the outside (the way that self-sacrificing, Christian love is provoked, alongside the sexual passion),---I didn't feel sorry for myself, I despised myself a little less. I ceased, a little more, to hope---and I felt lighter. I could laugh, tenderly, at myself.

I'm suffering from a lack of intellectual stimulation. I've exaggerated, over-reacted against the academic milieu in which I was completely submerged in my youth. That was an exaggeration. Then, starting with Harriet, I began an equivalent exaggeration in the opposite direction. It has become more and more extreme, so that in recent years I have spent almost all my time with people with mediocre minds.---However \[much\] they pleased me (because they were warmer, more sensual, more sensitive, had more experience of "the world"), they didn't stimulate me. I thought less and less. My mind got lazy, passive. I gained a lot but I also paid a big price. And it's that price now that humiliates me. I find many books difficult to read! (Especially philosophy). I write badly, with difficulty.

Idea for a novella from \[[the Yugoslav writer and dissident politician]{.i} \] Vladimir Dedijer today. "The Suicide Club." A political story, set in Yugoslavia---imaginary small country. New social movement among students (high school, university): suicide clubs spring up. Young people charged with the project of committing "altruistic suicides" to awaken conscience, blackmail government. They have meetings, workshops, consciousness-raising groups to prepare themselves. Then do it. In all there are 24 who do---(some are murdered, lose courage at the end and are pushed by their comrades). Dedijer's son did it at 19---jumped off a cliff just over his father's house. Later, it's discovered that the clubs were organized by the secret police.

Dr. Friedrich Ritter and Frau Dore Strauch von Koerwin arrived at the Galapagos Islands in 1929 to live there---both were Germans. Before coming there they had taken the precaution of having all their teeth extracted---replacing them by "râteliers" of steel. They wanted to create an Eden---which they called Friedo (first syllables of their first names). In 1924 (?) the famous Baroness Basquet von Wagner, accompanied by three very young men, arrived on the island. The total disappearance of the Baroness, who had herself called the Queen of the Galapagos, and two of her suitors; the fortuitous discovery of the third on the beach along with the corpse of a "pecheur de passage" \[["passing fisherman"]{.i}\] made big headlines in the papers toward the end of 1934 ...

Opening: "I was, as far as I know, conceived in China (in Tientsin, in 1932), but since my parents returned to the United States for my birth (in New York, in 1933), I spent the first years of my life---in the United States---making up for their disappointing prudence by telling school friends that I was born in China. They had gone back to China soon after I was born in New York, and stayed there most of the first five years of my life. My father was a fur trader; he had an office in New York, in the fur district (231 W 31st St), at the head of which he put his kid brother Aaron---and he ran the main office of the company, in Tientsin, which is where he and my mother had lived most of the time since they married in 1930. My father died in Tientsin while the city was under bombardments (it was the time of the Japanese invasion) but of TB on Oct. 19, 1938. He had been born, the fourth of five children of a poor immigrant family on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 6, 1906---had started public school in 1912, at the age of 6, quit school in 1916, at the age of 10 to go to work as a delivery boy in the fur district, and made his first trip to China in 1932, by then a representative of the fur company he worked for at the age of 16. He went into the Gobi Desert on the back of a camel to buy fur skins

"I don't know. D-id-d-y, I guess." And all the while, [Death Kit]{.i} was filling my head---and I asked John to excuse me, I couldn't stay. I had to go home.

Telling that story today to Nicole, the story of how the novel was given to me, intact, in a flash, all on the mention of the word "Diddy"---because Diddy has nothing to do with Richard Howard, is in no way even remotely based on him---it was just the word, a kind of "coup de foudre" \[["love at first sight"]{.i}\] à la \[[the French psychoanalyst Jacques]{.i}\] Lacan for that word qui a tout déclenché \[["that unleashed everything"]{.i}\]---but why? [Why]{.i} that word? I've never \[understood\]---telling Nicole that tale, as I've already told it thirty times in the last five years (remembering, as I told it, more my other tellings than the actual event)---suddenly, today, in a flash---again a flash---I understood.

The only sense in which everybody could be an artist is if art were understood exclusively as [performance]{.i}---or throw-away art. Art would be something people did, and if it resulted in an object you wouldn't have to (perhaps even be able to) keep it, store it in a museum. Cage, therefore, has a right to say he wants everybody to be an artist. There's very little product-making in his notion of art. There's nothing to keep, monumentalize. It self-destructs.

Has worked very little---occasional journalism, free-lance PR photography (John Lennon and Yoko at Colombe d'Or at Cannes Festival in 1970), script doctoring. Published his first novel two years ago; brought out by a small independent publisher in the Alpes-Maritimes, Robert Morel---a modern building in the middle of 180 hectares on the top of a hill ... with one steel door "that closes like a safe"; printed 10,000 copies---all sold, but only in the South of France---not one copy in Paris (publisher refuses to send the books to Paris bookstores, even when they are ordered); \[[Une Journée un peu chaude]{.i}\]; won a small, prestigious literary prize, le Prix Roger-Nimier.

Why not eliminate schooling between age 12--16? It's biologically + psychologically too turbulent a time to be cooped up inside, made to sit all the time. During these years, kids would live communally---doing some work, anyway being physically active, in the countryside; learning about sex---free of their
<?dp n="372" folio="356" ?>
parents. Those four "missing" years of school could be added on, at a much later age. At, say, age 50--54 everyone would have to go back to school. (One could get a deferment for a few years, in special cases, if one was in a special work or creative project that couldn't be broken off.)

This simple change in the age specificity of schooling would a) reduce adolescent discontent, anomie, boredom, neurosis; b) radically modify the almost inevitable process by which people at 50 are psychologically and intellectually ossified---have become increasingly conservative, politically---and retrograde in their tastes (Neil Simon plays, etc.)

I was so disappointed---and, above all I didn't want to waste (not have the opportunity to use) all the personal fantasies \[[In the margin]{.i}: (Daddy, M. \[[SS's mother]{.i}\], my childhood)\] that had been stirred up at the prospect of that trip. I wrote a story that started "I am going to China" precisely because I then thought I wasn't. I decided to let the four-year-old have her say, since the thirty-nine-year-old wasn't going to get to find out about Maoism and the Cultural Revolution. (Of course, when, in January, I did get to go---it was the 39-year-old who went; the 4-year-old, to my surprise, didn't even deign to come along. Was it because she'd gotten the load off her chest?

My mother lay in bed until four every afternoon in an alcoholic stupor, the blinds on the bedroom window firmly closed. I was brought up by a freckled elephant of Irish-German extraction who took me to Mass every Sunday and read me aloud stories in the evening paper about car accidents and loved Kate Smith. At seventeen, I met a thin, heavy-thighed, balding man who talked and talked, snobbishly, bookishly, and called me "Sweet." After a few days passed, I married him. We talked for seven years.

"I am not a feminist," she said. Of course not. She never accepted the fact that she was a woman. Hence, her making herself ugly (she wasn't), her way of dressing, her incapacity to have any sexual life, her being dirty, unkempt, the disorder of any room she occupied, etc. If she could have slept with anyone, it could only have been with a woman---not because she was "really" au fond homosexual (she wasn't) but because at least with a woman she wouldn't have felt she was being raped. But, of course, that was impossible too---given the time she lived, her particular milieu; above all, the way she had survived implied a profound + irrevocable desexualiza-tion of herself.

S.W. of course makes me think of Susan \[Taubes\]. Same hunger for purity, same refusal of the body, same unfitness to live. What was the difference between them? That S.W. had genius and Susan didn't. That S.W. assumed her own desexual-ization, affirmed it, drew energy from it---while Susan was "weak": she could never accept the love of women; she wanted to be hurt and dominated by men; she wanted to be beautiful, glamorous, mysterious. Susan's refusals only weakened her, they didn't give her energy. Her suicide was second-rate. S.W.'s was an exaltation---that's how, finally, she succeeded in imposing herself on the world, securing her own legend, blackmailing her contemporaries and posterity.

A lesson: purity and wisdom---one can't aspire to both---they're ultimately contradictory. Purity implies innocence, unselfconsciousness---(even) a certain stupidity. Wisdom implies lucidity, the overcoming of one's innocence---intelligence. One [must]{.i} be innocent in order to be pure. One [can't]{.i} be innocent in order to be wise.

Consider the image of homosexuals in films where that is being subliminally suggested while at the same time being contradicted:
<?dp n="395" folio="379" ?>
for example, many of the roles of Clifton Webb, Edward Everett Horton, and George Sanders in films of the 30s and 40s. Seeing Preminger's [Laura]{.i} (1944) again, I was struck by the fact that the character played by Webb (who turns out to be the murderer) is clearly the portrait of a homosexual: sarcastic, cold, elegant, worldly, smart, an aesthete and art collector.`</span>`{=html}

Intellectuals played at crusaders and revolutionaries only to discover they were still patricians and liberals. (As kids played at being urban guerrillas and settled for being punks.) "Liberalism" seems a vast, obscure, swampy territory one never emerges from, no matter how one tries---and perhaps never should.
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
It is from liberalism that one gets one's passion for justice---and that longing for a juster order in which those freedoms guaranteed by liberalism probably couldn't survive. The problem with liberalism is that it can never have an unambivalent attitude toward revolutions. Finally, it must take a counterrevolutionary position. (The Maoists are correct.) Liberals can, ought to, support the right of national self-determination (the right of other peoples to have civil wars and make revolutions) and oppose our government's slaughtering them. But liberals can't survive under these governments---as we know from the history of every Communist regime, without exception, that has taken power.
:::

::: p-blanc

::: p
To be an intellectual is to be attached to the inherent value of plurality, and to the right of critical space (space for critical opposition within society). Therefore, to be an intellectual supporting a revolutionary movement is to be assenting to one's own abolition. That's an arguable position: there is a good case to be made out that intellectuals are a luxury, and have no role in the only societies possible in the future.

Conversation with Joe \[Chaikin\] tonight. When he thinks about the theatre, he said, he can't think of any reason to work in it, any meaning to what he's doing. Only when he doesn't think about it (i.e. ask himself the question about the meaning, value, importance of his work) can he enjoy the work---and he does. I replied that when one asks oneself a question for a long time without ever getting a satisfactory answer, there is usually something wrong with the question (rather than the answer). One didn't---until the late 19th century---ask for art to justify itself, to manifest its meaning. That was like asking art to be useful, practical. I made the distinction between activities which were slavish, practical---one knows why one performs them: they're useful, necessary, obligatory---and activities which were free, voluntary, gratuitous. If practicing an art belongs in the second type of activity, and that is what draws us to the arts, then it would seem a kind of mistake to be restless and demoralized because we were subsequently unable to justify that activity, because that activity failed to justify itself as belonging to the first type of activity. We would be in the situation of doubting the value (worth) of our activity---work---because of the very quality that drew us to it in the first place: its gratuitousness.

Art Deco the last "international"---total---style. (From fine arts to furniture, everyday objects, clothes, etc.) All styles in the last 50 years have been comments on Art Deco. E.g.

It's not "natural" to speak well, eloquently, in an interesting articulate way. People living in groups, families, communes say little---have few verbal means. Eloquence---thinking in words---is a byproduct of solitude, deracination, a heightened painful individuality. In groups, it's more natural to sing, to dance, to pray: given, rather than invented (individual) speech.

Both are about Satanism; both describe and celebrate a Black Mass; both describe search for a metallic, transhuman sexuality;---but for Huysmans the tradition was already there, indeed it dated back to the Middle Ages, while for Ballard it is a "new" post-modern or futuristic sexuality or diabolism.

Common sense (le bon sens) is always wrong. It is the demagoguery of the bourgeois ideal. The function of common sense is to simplify, to reassure, to hide unpleasant truths and mysteries. I don't just mean that this is what common sense does, or ends up doing; I mean this is what it is designed to do. Of course, in order to be effective common sense must contain some part of the truth. But its main content is negative: To say (implicitly) that, this being so, that is not so.

Technological reproduction not simply an "era," as Benjamin says. That's misleading. It has its history---rather, \[it\] is inserted into history. Its artifacts become "historical," not merely contemporary. Old litho\[graphs\], photos, comic books, movies, etc. are redolent of the past, not the present. B\[enjamin\] thought tech. rep\[roduction\] made everything into an eternal present---a Hegelian end-of-history (and abolition of history).

"All art aspires to the condition of music"---this utterly nihilistic statement rests at the foundation of every moving camera style in the history of the medium. But it is a cliché, a 19th c\[entury\] cliché, less an aesthetic than a projection of an exhausted state of mind, less a world view than a world weariness, less a statement of vital forms than an expression of sterile decadence. There is quite another pov \[point of view\] about what "all art aspires to"---that was Goethe's, who put the primary art, the most aristocratic one, + the one art that cannot be made by the plebes but only gaped at w\[ith\] awe, + that art is architecture. Really great directors have this sense of architecture in their work---always expressive of immense line of energy, unstable + vital conduits of force.

Conversation with \[[the American painter R. B]{.i}.\] Kitaj at Bob's \[Robert Silvers\]. Spoke of "transcendent" art. Not possible if one doesn't know how to draw (and that's no longer taught in art schools). Last great painters were Picasso + Matisse. Best living painter(s): Bacon (+ Balthus). Only interested in depictive painting, figure painting. Whole 19th century French tradition referred itself to Ingres---Impressionism not possible without him. And who can draw like that now? Among contemporaries like Lucien Freud, Frank Auerbach, David Hockney---in England; de Kooning only American painter he

Joseph: "Censorship is good for writers. For three reasons. One, it unites the whole nation as (or into) readers. Two, it gives the writer limits, something to push against.

Loomis Pound' or 'Loomis Pound'" and that the Loomises were a good family ("Look in the New York Social Register; you'll see many Loomises."). "A biblical name," I said. "That's right, a Jewish name.

So far as it is really denied, death becomes the most important thing. (Like anything which is denied.) It is nowhere, and it is everywhere. While we deny death, the morbid has a supreme attraction for us. Perhaps because no transcendent source of values can anymore be detected, death (the extinction of consciousness) becomes a seal of value, of importance. (In a sense, only what concerns death has value.) This leads to both a promotion and a trivialization of the concept of death, which gives perhaps the deepest stimulus to the persistent iconography of violence + violent death in the artifacts of our culture. (The extraordinary frequency with which the plot of a serious contemporary novel turns on, or resolves itself, by a murder---compared with the extreme unlikelihood that the educated writers of vanguard fiction have ever been anywhere near a murder in their lives.)

[Tannhäuser]{.i} tonight at the Met \[[the Metropolitan Opera]{.i}\] (with \[[the American literary critic]{.i}\] Walter Clemons). The music is about sex---eroticism---voluptuousness. That's why one goes on loving Wagner. The stories of the operas, alas, are something else: the vulgarity; the kitsch problems (sex vs. soulfulness); the martial proto-Nazi volkishness. Nietzsche was right about Wagner---more right than he knew. And yet, and yet---that voluptuousness ...

Sex is getting a bad reputation. The 1960s---seemed like energy, joy, freedom from stuffy taboos, adventure. Now seems to many people more trouble than it's worth. A disappointment. Sex a sublimation of the desire to work. Sexual drive took them, into a wall ... Male homosexual "world" abandoned the gentle / bitchy homosexual (the "fairy," "fag," "fruit"---compulsively attending to his sexual needs)---+ gave itself over to lechery, vice, and sexual manias.

America + Western Europe are growing apart---becoming as different as they were in the 1950s. Western Europe has chosen Social Democracy (whatever the party in power calls itself), America has rejected it. Events of the 70s: 1) the discrediting of utopian communism as a plausible anchor-belief for intellectuals + artists; 2) the Euro-ization of the Western European countries; 3) the collapse of American imperialist ideology + growing cultural / political isolationism of the U.S.

Conversation with Enzensberger (lunch in Chinatown): Darwin as an alternative to Hegel. Hegelianism assumes the biological + the historical are two different processes. But maybe the historical proceeds naturally. An evolution, but one that can't be predicted. (What was attractive about Hegelianism was its notion of the [irony]{.i} of history.) Nobody has thought about Darwin\['s\] implications for 50 years in Germany, E. says. Survival of the fittest is mistrusted as survival of the strongest.

Aphorism is aristocratic thinking: this is all the aristocrat is willing to tell you; he thinks you should get it fast, without spelling out all the details.

With the (1943) epigraph of Canetti. "The great writers of aphorisms read as if they had all known each other very well."

::: p
One wonders why. Can it be that the literature of aphorisms teaches us the sameness of wisdom (as anthropology teaches us the diversity of culture)? The wisdom of pessimism. Or should we rather conclude that the form of the aphorism, of abbreviated or condensed or rogue thought, is a historically-colored voice which, when adopted, inevitably suggests certain attitudes; is the vehicle of a common thematics?
:::

::: p-blanc
 \
:::

::: p
The traditional thematics of the aphorist: the hypocrises of societies, the vanities of human wishes, the shallowness + deviousness of women; the sham of love; the pleasures (and necessity) of solitude; + the intricacies of one's own thought processes.

All note the mendacities + hypocrises of social life. And many of the great aphorists (Chamfort, Kraus) are not just condescending to but contemptuous of women; many are fascinated by their own mental processes + mental process in general (Lichtenberg, Wittgenstein).
