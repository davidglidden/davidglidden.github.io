T[HE]{.small} articles collected here were originally written for the
*New East,* which was published in Japan during the 1914 War under the
editorship of Mr. Robertson Scott. The editor suggested publishing them
in book form, but I did not feel like doing so at that time. Later, they
were made the basis of the First Series of my *Zen Essays* (1927),
which, therefore, naturally cover more or less the same ground.

Recently, the idea came to me that the old papers might be after all
reprinted in book form. The reason is that my *Zen Essays* is too heavy
for those who wish to have just a little preliminary knowledge of Zen.
Will not, therefore, what may be regarded as an introductory work be
welcomed by some of my foreign friends?

With this in view I have gone over the entire manuscript, and whatever
inaccuracies I have come across in regard to diction as well as the
material used have been corrected. While there are quite a few points I
would like to see now expressed somewhat differently, I have left them
as they stand, because their revision inevitably involves the recasting
of the entire context. So long as they are not misrepresenting, they may
remain as they were written.

If the book really serves as a sort of introduction to Zen Buddhism, and
leads the reader up to the study of my other works, the object is
attained. No claim is made here for a scholarly treatment of the subject
matter.

The companion book, *Manual of Zen Buddhism,* is recommended to be used
with this *Introduction.*

D[AISETZ TEITARO SUZUKI'S]{.small} works on Zen Buddhism are among the
best contributions to the knowledge of living Buddhism that recent
decades have produced, and Zen itself is the most important fruit that
has sprung from that tree whose roots are the collections of the
Pali-Canon.^[]{#calibre_link-105}[1](#calibre_link-18)^ We cannot be
sufficiently grateful to the author, first for the fact of his having
brought Zen closer to Western understanding, and secondly for the manner
in which he has achieved this task. Oriental religious conceptions are
usually so very different from our Western ones that even the very
translation of the words brings one up against the greatest
difficulties, quite apart from the meaning of the ideas exposed, which
under certain circumstances are better left untranslated. I have only to
mention the Chinese *"Tao",* which no European translation has yet
achieved. The original Buddhist writings themselves contain views and
ideas which are more or less unassimilable by the average Western
understanding. I do not know, for example, just what spiritual (or
perhaps climatic?) background or preparation is necessary before one can
deduce any completely clear idea from the Buddhist *Kamma.* In spite of
all that we know about the essence of Zen, here too there is the
question of a central perception of unsurpassed singularity. This
strange perception is called *Satori,* and may be translated as
"Enlightenment". Suzuki says (see page 65), *"Satori* is the *raison
d'être* of Zen, and without it there is no Zen." It should not be too
difficult for the Western mind to grasp what a mystic understands by
"enlightenment", or what is known as "enlightenment" in religious
parlance. *Satori,* however, depicts an art and a way of enlightenment
which is practically impossible for the European to appreciate. I would
point out the enlightenment of Hyakujo (Pai-chang Huai-hai, [A
.D]{.small}. 724-814) on page 59, and the legend on pages 62-3 of this
book.

The following may serve as a further example: A monk once went to
Gensha, and wanted to learn where the entrance to the path of truth was.
Gensha asked him, "Do you hear the murmuring of the brook?" "Yes, I hear
it," answered the monk. "There is the entrance," the master instructed
him.

I will be content with these few examples, which illustrate clearly the
opacity of the *satori* experiences. Even if we take example after
example, it is still extremely hazy how such an enlightenment comes and
of what it consists; in other words, by what or about what one is
enlightened. Kaiten Nukariya, who was himself a Professor at the
So-To-Shu Buddhist College in
Tokyo,^[]{#calibre_link-106}[2](#calibre_link-19)^ says, speaking of
enlightenment:

> "Having set ourselves free from the misconception of Self, next we
> must awaken our innermost wisdom, pure and divine, called the Mind of
> Buddha, or Bodhi, or Prajna by Zen Masters. It is the divine light,
> the inner heaven, the key to all moral treasures, the source of all
> influence and power, the seat of kindness, justice, sympathy,
> impartial love, humanity, and mercy, the measure of all things. When
> this innermost wisdom is fully awakened, we are able to realize that
> each and every one of us is identical in spirit, in essence, in nature
> with the universal life or Buddha, that each ever lives face to face
> with Buddha, that each is beset by the abundant grace of the Blessed
> One, that He arouses his moral nature, that He opens his spiritual
> eyes, that He unfolds his new capacity, that He appoints his mission,
> and that life is not an ocean of birth, disease, old age and death,
> nor the vale of tears, but the holy temple of Buddha, the Pure Land,
> where he can enjoy the bliss of Nirvana.

> Then our minds go through an entire revolution. We are no more
> troubled by anger and hatred, no more bitten by envy and ambition, no
> more stung by sorrow and chagrin, no more overwhelmed by melancholy
> and despair," etc.

That is how an Oriental, himself a disciple of Zen, describes the
essence of enlightenment. It must be admitted that this passage would
need only the most minute alterations in order not to be out of place in
any Christian mystical book of devotion. Yet somehow it fails to help us
as regards understanding the *satori* experience described by this
all-embracing casuistry. Presumably Nukariya is speaking to Western
rationalism, of which he himself has acquired a good dose, and that is
why it all sounds so flatly edifying. The abstruse obscurity of the Zen
anecdotes is preferable to this adaptation: *ad usum Delphini;* it
conveys a great deal more, while saying less.

*Zen is anything but a philosophy in the Western sense of the
word.*^[]{#calibre_link-107}[3](#calibre_link-20)^ This is the opinion
expressed by Rudolf Otto in his introduction to Ohasama's book on Zen,
when he says that Nukariya has fitted the magic oriental world of ideas
into our Western philosophic categories, and confused it with these. If
psychophysical parallelism, the most wooden of all doctrines, is invoked
in order to explain this mystical intuition of Not-twoness
*(Nichtzweiheit)* and Oneness and the *coincidentia oppositorium,* one
is completely ejected from the sphere of *koan* and *kwatsu* and
*satori*.^[]{#calibre_link-108}[4](#calibre_link-21)^ It is far better
to allow oneself to become deeply imbued beforehand with the exotic
obscurity of the Zen anecdotes, and to bear in mind the whole time that
*satori* is a *mysterium ineffabile,* as indeed the Zen masters wish it
to be. Between the anecdotes and the mystical enlightenment there is,
for our understanding, a gulf, the possibility of bridging which can at
best be indicated but never in practice
achieved.^[]{#calibre_link-109}[5](#calibre_link-22)^ One has the
feeling of touching upon a true secret, not something that has been
imagined or pretended; this is not a case of mystifying secrecy, but
rather of an experience that baffles all languages. *Satori* comes as
something unexpected, not to be expected.

When within the realm of Christianity visions of the Holy Trinity, the
Madonna, the Crucifixion or the Patron Saint are vouchsafed, one has the
impression that this is more or less as it should be. That Jacob Boehme
should obtain a glimpse into the *centrum naturae* by means of the
sunbeam reflected in the tin plate is also understandable. It is harder
to accept Master Eckehart's vision of "the little naked
boy",^[]{#calibre_link-110}[6](#calibre_link-23)^ or even Swedenborg's
"man in the red coat" who wanted to wean him from overeating, and whom,
in spite of this or perhaps because of it, he recognized as the Lord
God.^[]{#calibre_link-111}[7](#calibre_link-24)^ Such things are
difficult to accept, bordering as they do on the grotesque. Many of the
*satori* experiences, however, do not merely border on the grotesque;
they are right there in the midst of it, sounding like complete
nonsense.

For anyone, however, who has devoted considerable time to studying with
loving and understanding care the flowerlike nature of the spirit of the
Far East, many of these amazing things, which drive the all too simple
European from one perplexity to another, fall away. Zen is indeed one of
the most wonderful blossoms of the Chinese
spirit,^[]{#calibre_link-112}[8](#calibre_link-25)^ which was readily
impregnated by the immense thought-world of Buddhism. He, therefore, who
has really tried to understand Buddhist doctrine, if only to a certain
degree---i.e. by renouncing various Western prejudices--- will come upon
certain depths beneath the bizarre cloak of the individual *satori*
experiences, or will sense disquieting difficulties which the
philosophic and religious West has up to now thought fit to disregard.
As a philosopher, one is exclusively concerned with that understanding
which, for its own part, has nothing to do with life. And as a
Christian, one has nothing to do with paganism ("I thank thee, Lord,
that I am not as other men"). There is no *satori* within these Western
bounds---that is an Oriental affair. But is it really so? Have we in
fact no *satori?*

When one examines the Zen text attentively, one cannot escape the
impression that, with all that is bizarre in it, *satori* is, in fact, a
matter of *natural occurrence,* of something so very
simple^[]{#calibre_link-113}[9](#calibre_link-26)^ that one fails to see
the wood for the trees, and in attempting to explain it, invariably says
the very thing that drives others into the greatest confusion.
Nukariya^[]{#calibre_link-114}[10](#calibre_link-27)^ therefore is right
when he says that any attempt to explain or analyse the contents of Zen
with regard to enlightenment would be in vain. Nevertheless, this author
does venture to say of enlightenment that it embraces an *insight into
the nature of self,* and that it is an emancipation of the conscious
from an illusionary conception of
self.^[]{#calibre_link-115}[11](#calibre_link-28)^ The illusion
regarding the nature of self is the common confusion of the ego with
self. Nukariya understands by "self" the All-Buddha, i.e. simply a total
consciousness *(Be-wusstseinstotalität)* of life. He quotes Pan Shan,
who says, "The world of the mind encloses the whole universe in its
light," adding, "It is a cosmic life and a cosmic spirit, and at the
same time an individual life and an individual
spirit."^[]{#calibre_link-116}[12](#calibre_link-29)^

However one may define self, it is always something other than the ego,
and inasmuch as a higher understanding of the ego leads on to self the
latter is a thing of wider scope, embracing the knowledge of the ego and
therefore surpassing it. In the same way as the *ego* is a certain
knowledge of my *self*, so is the self a knowledge of my ego, which,
however, is no longer experienced in the form of a broader or higher
ego, but in the form of a non-ego *(Nicht-Ich).*

Such thoughts are also familiar to the author of *Deutsche
Theologie^[]{#calibre_link-117}[13](#calibre_link-30)^:* "Any creature
who is to become conscious of this perfection must first lose all
creaturelikeness (*Geschopfesart),* something-ness *(Etwasheit)* and
self." If I take any good to my-self, that comes from the delusion that
it is mine, or that I am Good. That is always a sign of imperfection and
folly. Were I conscious of the *truth,* I would also be aware that I am
not Good, that Good is not mine and is not of me." "Man says, 'Poor fool
that I am, I was under the delusion that I was it, but I find it *is*
and *was* truly God'."

That already states a considerable amount regarding the contents of
enlightenment. The occurrence of *satori* is interpreted and formulated
as a breakthrough of a consciousness limited to the ego-form in the form
of the non-ego-like self. This conception answers to the nature of Zen,
but also to the mysticism of Master
Eckehart.^[]{#calibre_link-118}[14](#calibre_link-31)^ The master says,
in his sermon on "Blessed are the poor in spirit": "When I came out from
God, all things said, 'There is a God!' But that cannot make me
blissful, for with it I conceive myself to be a creature. But in the
break-through,^[]{#calibre_link-119}[15](#calibre_link-32)^ when I wish
to remain empty in the will of God, and empty also of this will of God
and of all his works, and of God himself---then I am more than all
creatures, for I am neither God nor creature: I *am what I am, and what
I will remain,* now and forever! Then I receive a jerk, which raises me
above all the angels. In this jerk I become so rich that God cannot
suffice me, in spite of all that he is as God, in spite of all his Godly
works; for in this break-through I perceive what God and I are in
common. I *am then what I
was,^[]{#calibre_link-120}[16](#calibre_link-33)^* I grow neither less
nor more, for I am an immovable being who moves all things. Here God no
longer abides in man, for man through his poverty has won back what he
has always been and will always be."

Here the master is actually describing a *satori* experience, a release
of the ego through self, to which "Buddha-Nature", or godly
universality, is added. Since, out of scientific modesty, I do not here
presume to make any metaphysical declaration, but mean a change of
consciousness that can be experienced, I treat *satori* first of all as
a psychological problem. For anyone who does not share or understand
this point of view, the "explanation" will consist of nothing but words
which have no tangible meaning for him. He is not then able to make of
these abstractions a bridge to the facts related; in other words, he
cannot understand how the perfume of the blossoming laurel (pp. 60-1) or
the tweaked nose (p. 57)should affect such a considerable change of
consciousness. The simplest thing would be, of course, to relegate all
these anecdotes to the realm of amusing fairy stories, or at least, if
one accepts the facts as they are, to dispose of them as instances of
self-deception. (One would also willingly use here the expression
"auto-suggestion", that pathetic white elephant from the store of
spiritual inadequacies!) A serious and responsible examination of the
strange phenomena cannot lightly pass over these facts. We can of course
never decide definitely whether a person is *really* "enlightened" or
"redeemed", or whether he merely imagines it. We have no criteria for
this. Moreover, we know well enough that an imaginary pain is often far
more painful than a so-called real one, in that it is accompanied by a
subtle moral suffering caused by the gloomy feeling of secret
self-accusation. It is not, therefore, a question of "actual fact" but
of *spiritual reality;* that is to say, the psychic occurrence of the
happening known as *satori.*

Every spiritual happening is a picture and an imagination; were this not
so, there could be no consciousness and no phenomenality of the
occurrence. The imagination itself is a psychic occurrence, and
therefore whether an "enlightenment" is called "real" or "imaginary" is
quite immaterial. The man who has enlightenment, or alleges that he has
it, thinks in any case that he is enlightened. What others think about
it can determine nothing whatever for him with regard to his experience.
Even if he were to lie, his lie would be a spiritual fact. Yes, even if
all religious reports were nothing but conscious inventions and
falsifications, a very interesting psychological treatise could still be
written on the fact of such lies, with the same scientific treatment
with which the psychopathology of delusions is presented. The fact that
there is a religious movement upon which many brilliant minds have
worked over a period of many centuries is sufficient reason for
venturing at least upon a serious attempt to bring such happenings
within the realm of scientific understanding.

Earlier on I raised the question of whether we have anything like
*satori* in the West. If we except the sayings of our Western mystics, a
superficial glance discloses nothing that could be likened to it in even
the faintest degree. According to our thinking, the possibility that
there are steps in the development of consciousness does not exist. The
mere thought that there is a tremendous psychological difference between
the consciousness of the existence of an object and the *"consciousness
of the consciousness"* of an object borders on a subtlety which can
scarcely be answered. One could hardly bring oneself to take such a
problem so seriously as to take account of the psychological conditions
of the setting of any such problem. It is characteristic that the posing
of such and similar questions does not as a rule arise from any
intellectual need, but where it exists is nearly always rooted in a
primitive religious practice. In India it was Yoga and in China Buddhism
which supplied the motive power for these attempts to wrest oneself from
the bonds of a certain state of consciousness which was felt to be
incomplete. As far as Western mysticism is concerned, its texts are full
of instructions as to how man can and must release himself from the
"I-ness" *(Ichhaftigkeit)* of his consciousness, so that through the
knowledge of his being he may raise himself above it and reach the
inward (godlike) man. Ruysbroeck makes use of an image which is also
known to Indian philosophers, namely the tree that has its roots above
and its top below,^[]{#calibre_link-121}[17](#calibre_link-34)^ "And he
must climb up into the tree of belief, which grows downwards, since it
has its roots in the
godhead."^[]{#calibre_link-122}[18](#calibre_link-35)^ Ruysbroeck also
says, like Yoga, "Man shall be free and without images, freed from all
attachments and empty of all
creatures."^[]{#calibre_link-123}[19](#calibre_link-36)^ "He must be
untouched by lust and suffering, profit and loss, rising and falling,
concern about others, enjoyment and fear, and he shall not cling to any
creature."^[]{#calibre_link-124}[20](#calibre_link-37)^ It is in this
that the "unity" of the being consists, and this means "being turned
inwards". This means "that a man is turned inwards, in his own heart, so
that thereby he can feel and understand the inner working and the inner
words of God".^[]{#calibre_link-125}[21](#calibre_link-38)^ This new
condition of consciousness, arising from religious practice, is
distinguished by the fact that outward things no longer affect an
ego-like consciousness, whence a reciprocal attachment has arisen, but
that an empty consciousness stands open to another influence. This
"other" influence will no longer be felt as one's own activity, but as
the work of a non-ego which has consciousness as its
object.^[]{#calibre_link-126}[22](#calibre_link-39)^ It is as though the
subject-character of the ego had been overrun, or taken over, by another
subject which has taken the place of the
ego.^[]{#calibre_link-127}[23](#calibre_link-40)^ It is a question of
that well-known religious experience which has been formulated by St.
Paul *(Gal.* ii, 20). Here a new condition of consciousness is
undoubtedly described, separated from the former condition of
consciousness by means of a far-reaching process of religious
transformation.

It could be objected that *consciousness in itself* was not changed, but
only the *consciousness of something,* just as though one had turned
over the page of a book and now saw a different picture with the same
eyes. I am afraid this conception is no more than an arbitrary
interpretation, as it does not conform with the facts. The fact is that
in the text it is not merely a different picture or object that is
described, but rather the experience of a transformation, often
resulting from the most violent convulsions. The erasing of one picture
and its substitution by another is quite an everyday occurrence which
has none of the attributes of a transformation experience. It is not
that *something different is seen,* but that one *sees differently.* It
is as though the spatial act of seeing were changed by a new dimension.
When the master asks, "Do you hear the murmuring of the brook?" he
obviously means something quite different from ordinary
"hearing".^[]{#calibre_link-128}[24](#calibre_link-41)^ Consciousness is
something like perception, and just as the latter is subjected to
conditions and limits, so is consciousness. For instance, one can be
conscious at various stages, in a narrower or wider sphere, more
superficially or more deeply. These differences of degree are, however,
often differences of character, in that they depend completely upon the
development of the personality---that is to say, upon the nature of the
perceiving subject.

The intellect has no interest in the condition of the perceiving
subject, in so far as the latter thinks only logically. The intellect is
of necessity occupied with the digesting of the contents of the
consciousness, and with the methods of digesting. It needs a
philosophical passion to force the attempt to overcome the intellect and
to push through to perception of the perceiving. Such a passion,
however, is practically indistinguishable from religious motive power,
and this whole problem belongs, therefore, to the religious
transformation process, which is incommensurable with intellect. Antique
philosophy is undoubtedly to a great extent at the service of the
transformation process, which can be said less and less of the new
philosophy. Schopenhauer is implicitly antique. Nietzsche's
*Zarathustra* is, however, no philosophy but a dramatic transformation
process, which has completely swallowed up intellect. It is no longer a
question of thought, but in the highest sense of the thinker of
thought---and this on every page of the book. A new man, a completely
transformed man, is to appear on the scene, one who has broken the shell
of the old man and who not only looks upon a new heaven and a new earth,
but has created them. Angelus Silesius has expressed it rather more
modestly than *Zarathustra:*

*Mein Leib ist ein Schal, in dem ein Küchelein\
Vom Geist der Ewigkeit will ausgebrütet sein.*\
(My body is a shell, in which a chicken will be hatched\
from the spirit of eternity.)

*Satori* corresponds in the province of Christianity to a religious
transformation experience. As there are, however, various degrees and
types of such an experience, it would not be superfluous to designate
more exactly that category which corresponds most closely to the Zen
experience. This is undoubtedly the mystic experience, distinguishable
from similar experiences in that its preparation consists of "letting
oneself go" *(sich lassen)*, an "emptying of images" and other such
things; this is in contrast to religious experiences which, like the
Exercises of St. Ignatius, are based upon the practice and envisaging of
holy images. I should like to include in this latter category
transformation through belief and prayer, and through communal
experience in Protestantism, since in this a very definite supposition
plays the decisive role, and by no means "emptiness" or "release". The
statement, characteristic of the latter state, "God is a Nothing", would
be incompatible in principle with the contemplation of passion, with
belief and communal expectation.

Thus the analogy of *satori* with Western experience is confined to
those few Christian mystics whose sayings for the sake of paradoxy skirt
the border of heterodoxy or have actually overstepped it. It was
avowedly this quality that drew down upon Meister Eckehart the
condemnation of the Church. If Buddhism were a "Church" in our sense of
the word, the Zen movement would certainly have been an intolerable
burden to her. The reason for this is the extremely individual form of
the methods,^[]{#calibre_link-129}[25](#calibre_link-42)^ as also the
iconoclastic attitude of many
masters.^[]{#calibre_link-130}[26](#calibre_link-43)^ In so far as Zen
is a movement, collective forms have been shaped in the course of the
centuries, as can be seen from Suzuki's works on *The Training of the
Zen Buddhist Monk,^[]{#calibre_link-131}[27](#calibre_link-44)^* but in
form and content they concern externals only. Apart from the type of
habits, the way of spiritual training or forming seems to consist of
*koan* methods. By *koan* is understood a paradoxical question,
expression or action of the master. According to Suzuki's description it
seems to be chiefly a matter of master questions handed down in the form
of anecdotes. These are submitted by the teacher to the student for
meditation. A classic example is the Wu- or Mu-anecdote. A monk once
asked the master, "Has a dog Buddhist nature, too?", whereupon the
master answered, "Wu." As Suzuki remarks, this "Wu" means quite simply
"Wu", obviously just what the dog himself would have said in answer to
the question.

At first glance it would appear that the submission of such a question
as food for meditation would mean an anticipation or prejudicing of the
final result, and that the contents of the meditation would be
determined thereby, rather like the Jesuit Exercises, or certain Yogi
meditations, the substance of which is determined by a task submitted by
the teacher. The *koans*, however, are of such great variety, such
ambiguity, and above all of such overwhelming paradoxy, that even an
expert is completely in the dark as to what may emerge as a suitable
solution. Moreover, the descriptions of the experiences are so obscure
that in no single case could one perceive any unobjectionable rational
connection between the *koan* and the experience. Since no logical
succession can ever be proved, it is to be supposed that the *koan*
method lays not the smallest restriction upon the freedom of the
spiritual occurrences, and that the final result therefore comes from
nothing but the *individual predisposition* of the initiate. The
complete destruction of the rational intellect aimed at in the training
creates an almost perfect lack of supposition of the consciousness.
Conscious supposition is thereby excluded as far as possible, but not
unconscious supposition; that is, the existing but unperceived
psychological disposition, which is anything but emptiness and lack of
supposition. It is a nature-given factor, and when it answers---as is
obviously the *satori* experience---it is an answer of Nature, who has
succeeded in conveying her reactions direct to the
consciousness.^[]{#calibre_link-132}[28](#calibre_link-45)^ What the
unconscious nature of the student opposes to the teacher or to the
*koan* as an answer is manifestly *satori.* This, at least, appears to
me to be the view which, by all descriptions, would express the essence
of *satori* more or less correctly. This view is also supported by the
fact that the "glimpse into one's own nature", the "original man" and
the depth of the being are often to the Zen master a matter of supreme
concern.^[]{#calibre_link-133}[29](#calibre_link-46)^

Zen differs from all other philosophic and religious meditation
practices in its principle of *lack of supposition (Voraus-setzung).*
Buddha himself is sternly rejected; indeed, he is almost blasphemously
ignored, although---or perhaps just because---he could be the strongest
spiritual supposition of all. But he too is an image and must therefore
be set aside. Nothing must be present except what is actually there;
that is, man with his complete, unconscious supposition, of which,
simply because it *is* unconscious, he can never, never rid himself. The
answer which appears to come from a void, the light which flares up from
the blackest darkness, these have always been experiences of wonderful
and blessed illumination.

The world of consciousness is inevitably a world full of restrictions,
of walls blocking the way. It is of necessity always one-sided,
resulting from the essence of consciousness. No consciousness can
harbour more than a very small number of simultaneous conceptions. All
else must lie in shadow, withdrawn from sight. To increase the
simultaneous content creates immediately a dimming of consciousness;
confusion, in fact, to the point of disorientation. Consciousness does
not simply demand, but *is*, of its very essence, a strict limitation to
the few and hence the distinct. For our general orientation we are
indebted simply and solely to the fact that through attentiveness we are
able to effect a comparatively rapid succession of images. Attentiveness
is, however, an effort of which we are not permanently capable. We have
therefore to make do, so to speak, with a minimum of simultaneous
perceptions and successions of images. Hence wide fields of possible
perceptions are permanently eliminated, and consciousness is always
bound to the narrowest circle. What would happen if an individual
consciousness were to succeed in embracing at one glance a simultaneous
picture of all that it could imagine is beyond conception. If man has
already succeeded in building up the structure of the world from the few
clear things that he can perceive at one and the same time, what godly
spectacle would present itself to his eyes were he able to perceive a
great deal all at once and distinctly? This question only concerns
perceptions that are *possible* to us. But if we add to those the
unconscious contents---i.e. contents which are not yet, or no longer,
capable of consciousness---and then try to imagine a complete spectacle,
why, this is beyond the most audacious fantasy. This unimagin-ableness
is of course a complete impossibility in the conscious form, but in the
unconsciousness form it is a fact, inasmuch as all that is seething
below is an ever-present potentiality of conception. The unconscious is
an unglimpsable completeness of all subliminal psychic factors, a "total
exhibition" of potential nature. It constitutes the entire disposition
from which consciousness takes fragments from time to time. Now if
consciousness is emptied as far as possible of its contents, the latter
will fall into a state (at least a transitory state) of unconsciousness.
This displacement ensues as a rule in Zen through the fact of the energy
of the conscious being withdrawn from the contents and transferred
either to the conception of emptiness or to the *koan.* As the two
last-named must be stable, the succession of images is also abolished,
and with it the energy which maintains the kinetic of the conscious. The
amount of energy that is saved goes over to the unconscious, and
reinforces its natural supply up to a certain maximum. This increases
the readiness of the unconscious contents to break through to the
conscious. Since the emptying and the closing down of the conscious is
no easy matter, a special training and an indefinitely long period of
time^[]{#calibre_link-134}[30](#calibre_link-47)^ is necessary to
produce that maximum of tension which leads to the final breakthrough of
unconscious contents into the conscious.

The contents which break through are by no means completely unspecified.
As psychiatric experience with insanity shows, peculiar relations exist
between the contents of the conscious and the delusions and deliria that
break in upon it. They are the same relations as exist between the
dreams and the working conscious of normal men. The connection is in
substance a
*compensatory*^[]{#calibre_link-135}[31](#calibre_link-48)^*relationship*^[]{#calibre_link-136}[32](#calibre_link-49)^:
the contents of the unconscious bring to the surface everything
necessary^[]{#calibre_link-137}[33](#calibre_link-50)^ in the broadest
sense for the completion, i.e. *the completeness of conscious
orientation.* If the fragments offered by, or forced up from, the
unconscious are successfully built into the life of the conscious, a
psychic existence form results, which corresponds better to the whole of
the individual personality, and therefore abolishes fruitless conflict
between the conscious and the unconscious personality. Modern
psychotherapy rests upon this principle, inasmuch as it was able to
break away from the historic prejudice that the unconscious harbours
only infantile and morally inferior contents. There is certainly an
inferior corner, a lumberroom of dirty secrets, which are however not so
much unconscious as hidden and only half forgotten. But this has about
as much to do with the whole of the unconscious as a hollow tooth has
with the complete personality. The unconscious is the matrix of all
metaphysical assertions, of all mythology, all philosophy (in so far as
it is not merely critical) and all forms of life which are based upon
psychological suppositions.

Every invasion of the unconscious is an answer to a definite condition
of the conscious, and this answer follows from the whole of the
idea-possibilities that are present; that is to say, from the complete
disposition which, as explained above, is a simultaneous image *in
potentia* of psychic existence. The splitting up into the single, the
one-sided, the fragmentary character suits the essence of the conscious.
The reaction from the disposition always has the character of
completeness, as it corresponds with a nature which has not been divided
up by any discriminating
conscious.^[]{#calibre_link-138}[34](#calibre_link-51)^ Hence its
overpowering effect. It is the unexpected, comprehensive, completely
illuminating answer, which operates all the more as illumination and
revelation, since the conscious has wedged itself into a hopeless
blind-alley.^[]{#calibre_link-139}[35](#calibre_link-52)^

When therefore, after many years of the hardest practice and the most
strenuous devastation of rational understanding, the Zen student
receives an answer---the only true answer--- from Nature herself,
everything that is said of *satori* can be understood. As can easily be
seen, it is the *naturelike-ness (Naturhaftigkeit)* of the answer which
shines forth from most of the Zen anecdotes. Yes, one can accept with
complete complaisance the enlightened student who, as one story relates,
wished his master a sound thrashing as a reward (see pages 63-4). How
much wisdom lies in the master's "Wu", the answer to the question about
the Buddha nature of the dog! One must always consider, however, that on
the one hand there are any number of people who cannot distinguish
between a spiritual witticism and nonsense, and on the other hand very
many people who are convinced of their own cleverness to such an extent
that they have never in their lives met any but fools.

Great as is the value of Zen Buddhism for the understanding of the
religious transformation process, its use among Western people is very
improbable. The spiritual conceptions necessary to Zen are missing in
the West. Who amongst us would produce such implicit trust in a superior
master and his incomprehensible ways? This respect for the greater human
personality exists only in the East. Who could boast of believing in the
possibility of a transformation experience paradoxical beyond measure;
to the extent, moreover, of sacrificing many years of his life to the
wearisome pursuit of such an object? And finally, who would dare to take
upon himself the authority of a hetero-doxical transformation
experience? Let it be a man of little trustworthiness, one who, maybe
from pathological reasons, has too much to say for himself; such a man
would have no cause to complain of any lack of following among us. But
if the "Master" sets a hard task, which requires more than a lot of
parrot talk, the European begins to have doubts, for the steep path of
self-development is to him as mournful and dark as Hell.

I have no doubt that the *satori* experience does occur also in the
West, for we too have men who scent ultimate ends and will spare
themselves no pains to draw near to them. But they will keep silence,
not only out of shyness but because they know that any attempt to convey
their experiences to others would be hopeless. For there is nothing in
our culture approaching these aspirations, not even the Church, the
custodian of religious goods. It is in fact her function to oppose all
such extreme experiences, for these can only be heterodox. The only
movement within our culture which partly has, and partly should have,
some understanding of these aspirations is psychotherapy. It is
therefore not a matter of chance that this foreword is written by a
psychotherapist.

Taken basically, psychotherapy is a dialectic relationship between the
doctor and the patient. It is a discussion between two spiritual wholes,
in which all wisdom is merely a tool. The goal is transformation; not
indeed a predetermined, but rather an indeterminable, change, the only
criterion of which is the disappearance of I-ness. No efforts on the
part of the doctor force the experience. The most he can do is to make
easy the path of the patient towards the attainment of an attitude which
will oppose the least resistance to the decisive experience. If
knowledge plays no small part in our Western procedure, this is
equivalent to the importance of the traditional spiritual atmosphere of
Buddhism in Zen. Zen and its technique could only exist on the basis of
Buddhist spiritual culture, and this is its premise. You cannot destroy
a rationalist intellect that was never present. A Zen adept is not the
outcome of ignorance and lack of culture. Hence even with us it happens
not infrequently that a conscious ego and a conscious, cultivated
understanding must first be produced by therapy before one can even
think about abolishing I-ness or rationalism. Moreover, psychotherapy is
by no means dealing with men who, like Zen monks, are ready to make any
sacrifice for the sake of truth, but very often with the most stubborn
of all Europeans. Thus the tasks of psychotherapy are of course much
more varied, and the individual phases of the long process meet with far
more opposition than in Zen.

For these and many other reasons a direct transmission of Zen to Western
conditions is neither commendable nor even possible. The
psychotherapist, however, who is seriously concerned with the question
of the aims of his therapy cannot be unmoved when he sees what ultimate
result an oriental method of spiritual "healing"---i.e. "making
whole"---is striving for. It is a well-known fact that this problem has
been seriously occupying the most venturesome minds of the East for more
than two thousand years, and that in this respect methods and
philosophical doctrines have been developed which simply put all Western
attempts in the same line into the shade. Our attempts---with a few
exceptions---have all stopped short at either magic (mystery cults,
among which Christianity must be counted) or the intellectual
(philosophers from Pythagoras to Schopenhauer). It is only the spiritual
tragedies of Goethe's *Faust* and Nietzsche's *Zarathustra* which mark
the first glimmerings of the break-through of a total experience
*(Ganz-heitserlebnis)* in our Western
hemisphere.^[]{#calibre_link-140}[36](#calibre_link-53)^ And we do not
even know today what these, the most promising of all products of the
European mind, may at length signify, so overlaid are they with all the
materiality and obviousness of our preformed Greek
spirit.^[]{#calibre_link-141}[37](#calibre_link-54)^ Although our
intellect has brought well-nigh to perfection the ability of the bird of
prey to espy the tiniest mouse from the greatest height, the gravity of
earth seizes him and the Sangskaras entangle him in a world of confusing
pictures if he no longer looks for booty but turns at least one eye
inwards *to find him who seeks.* Yes, he falls into the travail of a
demoniacal birth, beset with unknown terrors and dangers and menaced by
deluding mirages and labyrinthine mazes. The worst of all fates
threatens the venturer; the silent, abysmal *loneliness* in the time
which he calls his own. Who knows anything about the deep motives for
the "masterpiece", as Goethe called *Faust*, or the shudders of the
"Dionysus Experience"? One must read *Bardo Th*ö*dol*, the Tibetan Book
of the Dead, backwards, as I have
suggested,^[]{#calibre_link-142}[38](#calibre_link-55)^ in order to find
an Eastern parallel to the torments and catastrophes of the Western "way
of release" to completeness. This is what matters---not good intentions,
clever imitations or even intellectual acrobatics. Such, in intimations
or in greater or lesser fragments, appears before the psychotherapist
who has freed himself from rash and shortsighted doctrinal opinions. If
he is a slave to his quasi-biological creed he will always try to reduce
what he observes to the banal familiar, and to bring it thereby to a
rationalistic denominator which only suffices one who is content with
illusions. The foremost of all illusions, however, is that something can
suffice someone. That illusion stands behind all that is unendurable and
in front of all progress, and it is one of the most difficult things to
overcome. If the psychotherapist finds time from his helpful activities
for a little reflection, or if by any chance he is forced into seeing
through his own illusions, it may dawn upon him how hollow and flat,
indeed how contrary to life are all rationalistic reductions when they
come upon something alive, that will develop. If he follows this up he
soon gets an idea of what it means "to tear open those doors which
everyone would gladly slink past".

I would not under any circumstances have it understood that in what I
have said above I am making any recommendation or offering any advice.
But when Western men begin to talk about Zen I consider it my duty to
show the European where our entrance lies to that "longest of all roads"
which leads to *satori*, and what difficulties strew that path, which
has been trodden by only a few of our great men---perhaps as a beacon on
a high mountain, shining out in the hazy future. It would be an
unhealthy mistake to assume that *satori* or *samadhi* are to be met
with anywhere below those heights. For a compete experience there can be
nothing cheaper or smaller than the whole. The psychological
significance of this can be understood by the simple consideration of
the fact that the conscious is only a part of the spiritual, and is
never therefore capable of spiritual completeness: for that the
indefinite expansion of the unconscious is needed. The latter, however,
can neither be captured with skilful formulae nor exorcized by means of
scientific dogmas, for there is something of Destiny clinging to
it---yes, it is sometimes Destiny itself, as *Faust* and *Zarathustra*
show all too clearly. The attainment of completeness calls for the use
of the whole. Nothing less will do; hence there can be no easier
conditions, no substitution, no compromise. Inasmuch as both *Faust* and
*Zarathustra*, despite the highest appreciation, are only on the
border-line of what is comprehensible to the European, one can scarcely
expect a cultured public who have only just begun to hear about the dim
world of the soul to be able to form any adequate conception of the
spiritual state of a man who has fallen into the confusions of the
*individuation process*, by which term I have designated the "becoming
whole" (*Ganz-werdung)*. People drag forth the vocabulary of pathology,
they console themselves with "neurosis" and "psychosis" terminology,
whisper about "creative mystery"---but what can a man who is probably
not a poet create? The last-mentioned misunderstanding has in modern
times caused not a few people to call themselves of their own grace
"artists". As if "art" had nothing at all to do with "ability"! If you
have nothing to "create", perhaps you create yourself.

Zen shows how much "becoming whole" means to the East. Preoccupation
with the riddles of Zen may perhaps stiffen the spine of the
faint-hearted European, or provide a pair of spectacles for his
shortsightedness, so that from his "gloomy hole in the wall" he may
enjoy at least a glimpse of the world of spiritual experience, which
until now has been shrouded in mist. It will certainly not end badly,
for those who are terrified will be effectively protected from further
corruption, as also from everything of significance, by the helpful idea
of "autosuggestion" (see page 63). I should like to warn the attentive
and sympathetic reader, however, not to underestimate the spiritual
depth of the East, or to assume any kind of cheapness in
Zen.^[]{#calibre_link-143}[39](#calibre_link-56)^ The zealously nurtured
attitude of literal credulity towards the oriental treasure of thought
is in this case a lesser danger, as in Zen there are fortunately none of
those marvellously incomprehensible words, as in Indian cults. Neither
does Zen play about with complicated Hatha-yoga
techniques,^[]{#calibre_link-144}[40](#calibre_link-57)^ which delude
the physiologically thinking European with the false hope that the
spirit can be obtained by sitting and by breathing. On the contrary, Zen
demands intelligence and will-power, as do all the greater things which
desire to become real.

B[UDDHISM]{.small} in its course of development has completed a form
which distinguishes itself from its so-called primitive or original
type---so greatly, indeed, that we are justified in emphasizing its
historical division into two schools, Hinayana and Mahayana, or the
Lesser Vehicle and the Greater Vehicle of salvation. As a matter of
fact, the Mahayana, with all its varied formulae, is no more than a
developed form of Buddhism and traces back its final authority to its
Indian founder, the great Buddha Sakyamuni. When this developed form of
the Mahayana was introduced into China and then into Japan, it achieved
further development in these countries. This achievement was no doubt
due to the Chinese and Japanese Buddhist leaders, who knew how to apply
the principles of their faith to the ever-varying conditions of life and
to the religious needs of the people. And this elaboration and
adaptation on their part has still further widened the gap that has
already been in existence between the
Mahayana[]{#calibre_link-146}[^1^](#calibre_link-60) and its more
primitive type. At present the Mahayana form may be said not to display,
superficially at least, those features most conspicuously characteristic
of original Buddhism.

For this reason there are people who would declare that this branch of
Buddhism is in reality no Buddhism in the sense that the latter is
commonly understood. My contention, however, is this: anything that has
life in it is an organism, and it is in the very nature of an organism
that it never remains in the same state of existence. An acorn is quite
different, even as a young oak with tender leaves just out of its
protective shell is quite different from a full-grown tree so stately
and gigantic and towering up to the sky. But throughout these varying
phases of change there is a continuation of growth and unmistakable
marks of identity, whence we know that one and the same plant has passed
through many stages of becoming. The so-called primitive Buddhism is the
seed; out of it Far-Eastern Buddhism has come into existence with the
promise of still further growth. Scholars may talk of historical
Buddhism, but my subject here is to see Buddhism not only in its
historical development but from the point of view of its still vitally
concerning us as a quickening spiritual force in the Far East.

Among the many sects of Buddhism that have grown up, especially in China
and Japan, we find a unique order claiming to transmit the essence and
spirit of Buddhism directly from its author, and this not through any
secret document or by means of any mysterious rite. This order is one of
the most significant aspects of Buddhism, not only from the point of
view of its historical importance and spiritual vitality, but from the
point of view of its most original and stimulating manner of
demonstration. The "Doctrine of the Buddha-heart (*buddhahridaya*)" is
its scholastic name, but more commonly it is known as "Zen". That Zen is
not the same as Dhyana, though the term *Zen* is derived from the
Chinese transliteration *(ch'an-na; zenna* in Japanese) of the original
Sanskrit, will be explained later on.

This school is unique in various ways in the history of religion. Its
doctrines, theoretically stated, may be said to be those of speculative
mysticism, but they are presented and demonstrated in such a manner that
only those initiates who, after long training, have actually gained an
insight into the system can understand their ultimate signification. To
those who have not acquired this penetrating knowledge, that is, to
those who have not experienced Zen in their everyday active life---its
teachings, or rather its utterances, assume quite a peculiar, uncouth,
and even enigmatical aspect. Such people, looking at Zen more or less
conceptually, consider Zen utterly absurd and ludicrous, or deliberately
making itself unintelligible in order to guard its apparent profundity
against outside criticism. But, according to the followers of Zen, its
apparently paradoxical statements are not artificialities contrived to
hide themselves behind a screen of obscurity; but simply because the
human tongue is not an adequate organ for expressing the deepest truths
of Zen, the latter cannot be made the subject of logical exposition;
they are to be experienced in the inmost soul when they become for the
first time intelligible. In point of fact, no plainer and more
straightforward expressions than those of Zen have ever been made by any
other branch of human experience. "Coal is black"---this is plain
enough; but Zen protests, "Coal is not black." This is also plain
enough, and indeed even plainer than the first positive statement when
we come right down to the truth of the matter.

Personal experience, therefore, is everything in Zen. No ideas are
intelligible to those who have no backing of experience. This is a
platitude. A baby has no ideas, for its mentality is not yet so
developed as to experience anything in the way of ideas. If it has them
at all, they must be something extremely obscure and blurred and not in
correspondence with realities. To get the clearest and most efficient
understanding of a thing, therefore, it must be experienced personally.
Especially when the thing is concerned with life itself, personal
experience is an absolute necessity. Without this experience nothing
relative to its profound working will ever be accurately and therefore
efficiently grasped. The foundation of all concepts is simple,
unsophisticated experience. Zen places the utmost emphasis upon this
foundation experience, and it is around this that Zen constructs all the
verbal and conceptual scaffold which is found in its literature known as
"Sayings" (*goroku*, J.; *yu-lu*, Ch.). Though the scaffold affords a
most useful means to reach the inmost reality, it is still an
elaboration and artificiality. We lose its whole significance when it is
taken for a final reality. The nature of the human understanding compels
us not to put too much confidence in the superstructure. Mystification
is far from being the object of Zen itself, but to those who have not
touched the central fact of life Zen inevitably appears as mystifying.
Penetrate through the conceptual superstructure and what is imagined to
be a mystification will at once disappear, and at the same time there
will be an enlightenment known as
*satori.*[]{#calibre_link-147}[^2^](#calibre_link-61)

Zen, therefore, most strongly and persistently insists on an inner
spiritual experience. It does not attach any intrinsic importance to the
sacred sutras or to their exegeses by the wise and learned. Personal
experience is strongly set against authority and objective revelation,
and as the most practical method of attaining spiritual enlightenment
the followers of Zen propose the practice of Dhyana, known as
*Zanen*[]{#calibre_link-148}[^3^](#calibre_link-62) in Japanese.

A few words must be said here in regard to the systematic training by
Zen of its followers in the attainment of the spiritual insight which
has been referred to before as the foundation-experience of Zen. For
this is where Zen pre-eminently distinguishes itself from other forms of
mysticism. To most mystics such spiritual experience, so intensely
personal, comes as something sporadic, isolated, and unexpected.
Christians use prayer, or mortification, or contemplation so called, as
the means of bringing this on themselves, and leave its fulfilment to
divine grace. But as Buddhism does not recognize a supernatural agency
in such matters, the Zen method of spiritual training is practical and
systematic. From the beginning of its history in China there has been
such a tendency well marked; but, as time went on, a regular system has
finally come into existence, and the Zen school at present has a
thoroughgoing method for its followers to train themselves in the
attainment of their object. Herein lies the practical merit of Zen.
While it is highly speculative on the one hand, its methodical
discipline on the other hand produces most fruitful and beneficial
results on moral character. We sometimes forget its highly abstract
character when it is expressed in connection with the facts of our
everyday practical life; but here it is where we have to appreciate the
real value of Zen, for Zen finds an inexpressibly deep thought even in
holding up a finger, or in saying a "good morning" to a friend casually
met on the street. In the eye of Zen the most practical is the most
abstruse, and *vice versa*. All the system of discipline adopted by Zen
is the outcome of this fundamental experience.

I said that Zen is mystical. This is inevitable, seeing that Zen is the
keynote of Oriental culture; it is what makes the West frequently fail
to fathom exactly the depths of the Oriental mind, for mysticism in its
very nature defies the analysis of logic, and logic is the most
characteristic feature of Western thought. The East is synthetic in its
method of reasoning; it does not care so much for the elaboration of
particulars as for a comprehensive grasp of the whole, and this
intuitively. Therefore the Eastern mind, if we assume its existence, is
necessarily vague and indefinite, and seems not to have an index which
at once reveals the contents to an outsider. The thing is there before
our eyes, for it refuses to be ignored; but when we endeavour to grasp
it in our own hands in order to examine it more closely or
systematically, it eludes and we lose its track. Zen is provokingly
evasive. This is not due of course to any conscious or premeditated
artifice with which the Eastern mind schemes to shun the scrutiny of
others. The unfathomableness is in the very constitution, so to speak,
of the Eastern mind. Therefore, to understand the East we must
understand mysticism; that is, Zen.

It is to be remembered, however, that there are various types of
mysticism, rational and irrational, speculative and occult, sensible and
fantastic. When I say that the East is mystical, I do not mean that the
East is fantastic, irrational, and altogether impossible to bring within
the sphere of intellectual comprehension. What I mean is simply that in
the working of the Eastern mind there is something calm, quiet, silent,
undisturbable, which appears as if always looking into eternity. This
quietude and silence, however, does not point to mere idleness or
inactivity. The silence is not that of the desert shorn of all
vegetation, nor is it that of a corpse forever gone to sleep and decay.
It is the silence of an "eternal abyss" in which all contrasts and
conditions are buried; it is the silence of God who, deeply absorbed in
contemplation of his works past, present, and future, sits calmly on his
throne of absolute oneness and allness. It is the "silence of thunder"
obtained in the midst of the flash and uproar of opposing electric
currents. This sort of silence pervades all things Oriental. Woe unto
those who take it for decadence and death, for they will be overwhelmed
by an overwhelming outburst of activity out of the eternal silence. It
is in this sense that I speak of the mysticism of Oriental culture. And
I can affirm that the cultivation of this kind of mysticism is
principally due to the influence of Zen. If Buddhism were to develop in
the Far East so as to satisfy the spiritual cravings of its people, it
had to grow into Zen. The Indians are mystical, but their mysticism is
too speculative, too contemplative, too complicated, and, moreover, it
does not seem to have any teal, vital relation with the practical world
of particulars in which we are living. The Far-Eastern mysticism, on the
contrary, is direct, practical, and surprisingly simple. This could not
develop into anything else but Zen.

All the other Buddhist sects in China as well as in Japan bespeak their
Indian origin in an unmistakable manner. For their metaphysical
complexity, their long-winded phraseology, their highly abstract
reasoning, their penetrating insight into the nature of things, and
their comprehensive interpretation of affairs relating to life, are most
obviously Indian and not at all Chinese or Japanese. This will be
recognized at once by all those who are acquainted with Far-Eastern
Buddhism. For instance, look at those extremely complex rites as
practised by the Shingon sect, and also at their elaborate systems of
"Mandala", by means of which they try to explain the universe. No
Chinese or Japanese mind would have conceived such an intricate network
of philosophy without being first influenced by Indian thought. Then
observe how highly speculative is the philosophy of the Madhyamika, the
Tendai *(T'ien-tai* in C.), or Kegon *(Avatamsaka* or *Gandazyuha* in
Sanskrit). Their abstraction and logical acumen are truly amazing. These
facts plainly show that those sects of Far-Eastern Buddhism are at
bottom foreign importations.

But when we come to Zen, after a survey of the general field of
Buddhism, we are compelled to acknowledge that its simplicity, its
directness, its pragmatic tendency, and its close connection with
everyday life stand in remarkable contrast to the other Buddhist sects.
Undoubtedly the main ideas of Zen are derived from Buddhism, and we
cannot but consider it a legitimate development of the latter; but this
development has been achieved in order to meet the requirements
peculiarly characteristic of the psychology of the Far-Eastern people.
The spirit of Buddhism has left its highly metaphysical super-structure
in order to become a practical discipline of life. The result is Zen.
Therefore I make bold to say that in Zen are found systematized, or
rather crystallized, all the philosophy, religion, and life itself of
the Far-Eastern people, especially of the Japanese.

B[EFORE]{.small} proceeding to expound the teaching of Zen at some
length in the following pages, let me answer some of the questions which
are frequently raised by critics concerning the real nature of Zen.

Is Zen a system of philosophy, highly intellectual and profoundly
metaphysical, as most Buddhist teachings are?

I have already stated that we find in Zen all the philosophy of the East
crystallized, but this ought not to be taken as meaning that Zen is a
philosophy in the ordinary application of the term. Zen is decidedly not
a system founded upon logic and analysis. If anything, it is the
antipode to logic, by which I mean the dualistic mode of thinking. There
may be an intellectual element in Zen, for Zen is the whole mind, and in
it we find a great many things; but the mind is not a composite thing
that is to be divided into so many faculties, leaving nothing behind
when the dissection is over. Zen has nothing to teach us in the way of
intellectual analysis; nor has it any set doctrines which are imposed on
its followers for acceptance. In this respect Zen is quite chaotic if
you choose to say so. Probably Zen followers may have sets of doctrines,
but they have them on their own account, and for their own benefit; they
do not owe the fact to Zen. Thereore, there are in Zen no sacred books
or dogmatic tenets, nor are there any symbolic formulae through which an
access might be gained into the signification of Zen. If I am asked,
then, what Zen teaches, I would answer, Zen teaches nothing. Whatever
teachings there are in Zen, they come out of one's own mind. We teach
ourselves; Zen merely points the way. Unless this pointing is teaching,
there is certainly nothing in Zen purposely set up as its cardinal
doctrines or as its fundamental philosophy.

Zen claims to be Buddhism, but all the Buddhist teachings as propounded
in the sutras and sastras are treated by Zen as mere waste paper whose
utility consists in wiping off the dirt of intellect and nothing more.
Do not imagine, however, that Zen is nihilism. All nihilism is
self-destructive, it ends nowhere. Negativism is sound as method, but
the highest truth is an affirmation. When it is said that Zen has no
philosophy, that it denies all doctrinal authority, that it casts aside
all so-called sacred literature as rubbish, we must not forget that Zen
is holding up in this very act of negation something quite positive and
eternally affirmative. This will become clearer as we proceed.

Is Zen a religion? It is not a religion in the sense that the term is
popularly understood; for Zen has no God to worship, no ceremonial rites
to observe, no future abode to which the dead are destined, and, last of
all, Zen has no soul whose welfare is to be looked after by somebody
else and whose immortality is a matter of intense concern with some
people. Zen is free from all these dogmatic and "religious"
encumbrances.

When I say there is no God in Zen, the pious reader may be shocked, but
this does not mean that Zen denies the existence of God; neither denial
nor affirmation concerns Zen. When a thing is denied, the very denial
involves something not denied. The same can be said of affirmation. This
is inevitable in logic. Zen wants to rise above logic, Zen wants to find
a higher affirmation where there are no antitheses. Therefore, in Zen,
God is neither denied nor insisted upon; only there is in Zen no such
God as has been conceived by Jewish and Christian minds. For the same
reason that Zen is not a philosophy, Zen is not a religion.

As to all those images of various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and Devas and
other beings that one comes across in Zen temples, they are like so many
pieces of wood or stone or metal; they are like the camellias, azalias,
or stone lanterns in my garden. Make obeisance to the camellia now in
full bloom, and worship it if you like, Zen would say. There is as much
religion in so doing as in bowing to the various Buddhist gods, or as
sprinkling holy water, or as participating in the Lord's Supper. All
those pious deeds considered to be meritorious or sanctifying by most
so-called religiously minded people are artificialities in the eyes of
Zen. It boldly declares that "the immaculate Yogins do not enter Nirvana
and the precept-violating monks do not go to hell". This, to ordinary
minds, is a contradiction of the common law of moral life, but herein
lies the truth and life of Zen. Zen is the spirit of a man. Zen believes
in his inner purity and goodness. Whatever is superadded or violently
torn away, injures the wholesomeness of the spirit. Zen, therefore, is
emphatically against all religious conventionalism.

Its irreligion, however, is merely apparent. Those who are truly
religious will be surprised to find that after all there is so much of
religion in the barbarous declaration of Zen. But to say that Zen is a
religion, in the sense that Christianity or Mohammedanism is, would be a
mistake. To make my point clearer, I quote the following. When Sakyamuni
was born, it is said that he lifted one hand toward the heavens and
pointed to the earth with the other, exclaiming, "Above the heavens and
below the heavens, I alone am the Honoured One!" Ummon (Yun-men),
founder of the Ummon School of Zen, comments on this by saying, "If I
had been with him at the moment of his uttering this, I would surely
have struck him dead with one blow and thrown the corpse into the maw of
a hungry dog." What unbelievers would ever think of making such raving
remarks over a spiritual leader? Yet one of the Zen masters following
Ummon says: "Indeed, this is the way Ummon desires to serve the world,
sacrificing everything he has, body and mind! How grateful he must have
felt for the love of Buddha!"

Zen is not to be confounded with a form of meditation as practised by
"New Thought" people, or Christian Scientists, or Hindu Sannyasins, or
some Buddhists. Dhyana, as it is understood by Zen, does not correspond
to the practice as carried on in Zen. A man may meditate on a religious
or philosophical subject while disciplining himself in Zen, but that is
only incidental; the essence of Zen is not there at all. Zen purposes to
discipline the mind itself, to make it its own master, through an
insight into its proper nature. This getting into the real nature of
one's own mind or soul is the fundamental object of Zen Buddhism. Zen,
therefore, is more than meditation and Dhyana in its ordinary sense. The
discipline of Zen consists in opening the mental eye in order to look
into the very reason of existence.

To meditate, a man has to fix his thought on something; for instance, on
the oneness of God, or his infinite love, or on the impermanence of
things. But this is the very thing Zen desires to avoid. If there is
anything Zen strongly emphasizes it is the attainment of freedom; that
is, freedom from all unnatural encumbrances. Meditation is something
artificially put on; it does not belong to the native activity of the
mind. Upon what do the fowl of the air meditate? Upon what do the fish
in the water meditate? They fly; they swim. Is not that enough? Who
wants to fix his mind on the unity of God and man, or on the nothingness
of this life? Who wants to be arrested in the daily manifestations of
his life-activity by such meditations as the goodness of a divine being
or the everlasting fire of hell?

We may say that Christianity is monotheistic, and the Vedanta
pantheistic; but we cannot make a similar assertion about Zen. Zen is
neither monotheistic nor pantheistic; Zen defies all such designations.
Hence there is no object in Zen upon which to fix the thought. Zen is a
wafting cloud in the sky. No screw fastens it, no string holds it; it
moves as it lists. *No amount of meditation will keep Zen in one place*.
Meditation is not Zen. Neither pantheism nor monotheism provides Zen
with its subjects of concentration. If Zen is monotheistic, it may tell
its followers to meditate on the oneness of things where all differences
and inequalities, enveloped in the all-illuminating brightness of the
divine light, are obliterated. If Zen were pantheistic it would tell us
that every meanest flower in the field reflects the glory of God. But
what Zen says is "After all things are reduced to oneness, where would
that One be reduced?" Zen wants to have one's mind free and
unobstructed; even the idea of oneness or allness is a stumbling-block
and a strangling snare which threatens the original freedom of the
spirit.

Zen, therefore, does not ask us to concentrate our thought on the idea
that a dog is God, or that three pounds of flax are divine. When Zen
does this it commits itself to a definite system of philosophy, and
there is no more Zen. Zen just feels fire warm and ice cold, because
when it freezes we shiver and welcome fire. The feeling is all in all,
as Faust declares; all our theorization fails to touch reality. But "the
feeling" here must be understood in its deepest sense or in its purest
form. Even to say that "This is the feeling" means that Zen is no more
there. Zen defies all concept-making. That is why Zen is difficult to
grasp.

Whatever meditation Zen may propose, then, will be to take things as
they are, to consider snow white and the raven black. When we speak of
meditation we in most cases refer to its abstract character; that is,
meditation is known to be the concentration of the mind on some highly
generalized proposition, which is, in the nature of things, not always
closely and directly connected with the concrete affairs of life. Zen
perceives or feels, and does not abstract nor meditate. Zen penetrates
and is finally lost in the immersion. Meditation, on the other hand, is
outspokenly dualistic and consequently inevitably superficial.

One critic[]{#calibre_link-150}[^1^](#calibre_link-64) regards Zen as
"the Buddhist counterpart of the 'Spiritual Exercises' of St. Ignatius
Loyala". The critic shows a great inclination to find Christian
analogies for things Buddhistic, and this is one of such instances.
Those who have at all a clear understanding of Zen will at once see how
wide of the mark this comparison is. Even superficially speaking, there
is not a shadow of similitude between the exercises of Zen and those
proposed by the founder of the Society of Jesus. The contemplations and
prayers of St. Ignatius are, from the Zen point of view, merely so many
fabrications of the imagination elaborately woven for the benefit of the
piously minded; and in reality this is like piling tiles upon tiles on
one's head, and there is no true gain in the life of the spirit. We can
say this, however, that those "Spiritual Exercises" in some ways
resemble certain meditations of Hinayana Buddhism, such as the Five
Mind-quieting Methods, or the Nine Thoughts on Impurity, or the Six or
Ten Subjects of Memory.

Zen is sometimes made to mean "mind-murder and the curse of idle
reverie". This is the statement of Griffis, the well-known author of
*Religions of Japan*.[]{#calibre_link-151}[^2^](#calibre_link-65) By
"mind-murder" I do not know what he really means, but does he mean that
Zen kills the activities of the mind by making one's thought fix on one
thing, or by inducing sleep? Mr. Reischauer in his
book[]{#calibre_link-152}[^3^](#calibre_link-66) almost endorses this
view of Griffis by asserting that Zen is "mystical self-intoxication".
Does he mean that Zen is intoxicated in the "Greater Self"; so called,
as Spinoza was intoxicated in God? Though Mr. Reis-chauer is not quite
clear as to the meaning of "intoxication", he may think that Zen is
unduly absorbed in the thought of the "Greater Self" as the final
reality in this world of particulars. It is amazing to see how
superficial some of the uncritical observers of Zen are! In point of
fact, Zen has no "mind" to murder; therefore, there is no
"mind-murdering" in Zen. Zen has again no "self" as something to which
we can cling as a refuge; therefore, in Zen again there is no "self" by
which we may become intoxicated.

The truth is, Zen is extremely elusive as far as its outward aspects are
concerned; when you think you have caught a glimpse of it, it is no more
there; from afar it looks so approachable, but as soon as you come near
it you see it even further away from you than before. Unless, therefore,
you devote some years of earnest study to the understanding of its
primary principles, it is not to be expected that you will begin to have
a fair grasp of Zen.

"The way to ascend unto God is to descend into one's self";---these are
Hugo's words. "If thou wishest to search out the deep things of God,
search out the depths of thine own spirit";---this comes from Richard of
St. Victor. When all these deep things are searched out there is after
all no "self". Where you can descend, there is no "spirit", no "God"
whose depths are to be fathomed. Why? Because Zen is a bottomless abyss.
Zen declares, though in a somewhat different manner: "Nothing really
exists throughout the triple world; where do you wish to see the mind
(or spirit = *hsin*)? The four elements are all empty in their ultimate
nature; where could the Buddha's abode be?---but lo! the truth is
unfolding itself right before your eye. This is all there is to it---and
indeed nothing more!" A minute's hesitation and Zen is irrevocably lost.
All the Buddhas of the past, present, and future may try to make you
catch it once more, and yet it is a thousand miles away. "Mind-murder"
and "self-intoxication", forsooth! Zen has no time to bother itself with
such criticisms.

The critics may mean that the mind is hypnotized by Zen to a state of
unconsciousness, and that when this obtains, the favourite Buddhist
doctrine of emptiness *(sunyata)* is realized, where the subject is not
conscious of an objective world or of himself, being lost in one vast
emptiness, whatever this may be. This interpretation again fails to hit
Zen aright. It is true that there are some such expressions in Zen as
might suggest this kind of interpretation, but to understand Zen we must
make a leap here. The "vast emptiness" must be traversed. The subject
must be awakened from a state of unconsciousness if he does not wish to
be buried alive. Zen is attained only when "self-intoxication" is
abandoned and the "drunkard" is really awakened to his deeper self. If
the mind is ever to be "murdered", leave the work in the hand of Zen;
for it is Zen that will restore the murdered and lifeless one into a
state of eternal life. "Be born again, be awakened from the dream, rise
from the death, O ye drunkards!" Zen would exclaim. Do not try,
therefore, to see Zen with the eyes bandaged; and your hands are too
unsteady to take hold of it. And remember I am not indulging in figures
of speech.

I might multiply many such criticisms if it were necessary but I hope
that the above have sufficiently prepared the reader's mind for the
following more positive statements concerning Zen. The basic idea of Zen
is to come in touch with the inner workings of our being, and to do this
in the most direct way possible, without resorting to anything external
or superadded. Therefore, anything that has the semblance of an external
authority is rejected by Zen. Absolute faith is placed in a man's own
inner being. For whatever authority there is in Zen, all comes from
within. This is true in the strictest sense of the word. Even the
reasoning faculty is not considered final or absolute. On the contrary,
it hinders the mind from coming into the directest communication with
itself. The intellect accomplishes its mission when it works as an
intermediary, and Zen has nothing to do with an intermediary except when
it desires to communicate itself to others. For this reason all the
scriptures are merely tentative and provisory; there is in them no
finality. The central fact of life as it is lived is what Zen aims to
grasp, and this in the most direct and most vital manner. Zen professes
itself to be the spirit of Buddhism, but in fact it is the spirit of all
religions and philosophies. When Zen is thoroughly understood, absolute
peace of mind is attained, and a man lives as he ought to live. What
more may we hope?

Some say that as Zen is admittedly a form of mysticism it cannot claim
to be unique in the history of religion. Perhaps so; but Zen is a
mysticism of its own order. It is mystical in the sense that the sun
shines, that the flower blooms, that I hear at this moment somebody
beating a drum in the street. If these are mystical facts, Zen is
brim-full of them. When a Zen master was once asked what Zen was, he
replied, "Your everyday thought." Is this not plain and most
straightforward? It has nothing to do with any sectarian spirit.
Christians as well as Buddhists can practise Zen just as big fish and
small fish are both contentedly living in the same ocean. Zen is the
ocean, Zen is the air, Zen is the mountain, Zen is thunder and
lightning, the spring flower, summer heat, and winter snow; nay, more
than that, Zen is the man. With all the formalities, conventionalisms,
and superadditions that Zen has accumulated in its long history, its
central fact is very much alive. The special merit of Zen lies in this:
that we are still able to see into this ultimate fact without being
biased by anything.

As has been said before, what makes Zen unique as it is practised in
Japan is its systematic training of the mind. Ordinary mysticism has
been too erratic a product and apart from one's ordinary life; this Zen
has revolutionized. What was up in the heavens, Zen has brought down to
earth. With the development of Zen, mysticism has ceased to be mystical;
it is no more the spasmodic product of an abnormally endowed mind. For
Zen reveals itself in the most uninteresting and uneventful life of a
plain man of the street, recognizing the fact of living in the midst of
life as it is lived. Zen systematically trains the mind to see this; it
opens a man's eye to the greatest mystery as it is daily and hourly
performed; it enlarges the heart to embrace eternity of time and
infinity of space in its every palpitation; it makes us live in the
world as if walking in the garden of Eden; and all these spiritual feats
are accomplished without resorting to any doctrines but by simply
asserting in the most direct way the truth that lies in our inner being.

Whatever else Zen may be, it is practical and commonplace and at the
same time most living. An ancient master, wishing to show what Zen is,
lifted one of his fingers, another kicked a ball, and a third slapped
the face of his questioner. If the inner truth that lies deep in us is
thus demonstrated, is not Zen the most practical and direct method of
spiritual training ever resorted to by any religion? And is not this
practical method also a most original one? Indeed, Zen cannot be
anything else but original and creative because it refuses to deal with
concepts but deals with living facts of life. When conceptually
understood, the lifting of a finger is one of the most ordinary
incidents in everybody's life. But when it is viewed from the Zen point
of view it vibrates with divine meaning and creative vitality. So long
as Zen can point out this truth in the midst of our conventional and
concept-bound existence we must say that it has its reason of being.

The following quotation from a letter of Yengo (Yuan-wu in C. 1566-1642)
may answer, to a certain extent, the question asked in the beginning of
this chapter, "What is Zen?"

"It is presented right to your face, and at this moment the whole thing
is handed over to you. For an intelligent fellow, one word should
suffice to convince him of the truth of it, but even then error has
crept in. Much more so when it is committed to paper and ink, or given
up to wordy demonstration or to logical quibble, then it slips farther
away from you. The great truth of Zen is possessed by everybody. Look
into your own being and seek it not through others. Your own mind is
above all forms; it is free and quiet and sufficient; it eternally
stamps itself in your six senses and four elements. In its light all is
absorbed. Hush the dualism of subject and object, forget both, transcend
the intellect, sever yourself from the understanding, and directly
penetrate deep into the identity of the Buddha-mind; outside of this
there are no realities. Therefore, when Bodhidharma came from the West,
he simply declared, 'Directly pointing to one's own soul, my doctrine is
unique, and is not hampered by the canonical teachings; it is the
absolute transmission of the true seal.' Zen has nothing to do with
letters, words, or sutras. It only requests you to grasp the point
directly and therein to find your peaceful abode. When the mind is
disturbed, the understanding is stirred, things are recognized, notions
are entertained, ghostly spirits are conjured, and prejudices grow
rampant. Zen will then forever be lost in the maze.

"The wise Sekiso (Shih-shuang) said, 'Stop all your hankerings; let the
mildew grow on your lips; make yourself like unto a perfect piece of
immaculate silk; let your one thought be eternity; let yourself be like
dead ashes, cold and lifeless; again let yourself be like an old censer
in a deserted village shrine!'

"Putting your simple faith in this, discipline yourself accordingly; let
your body and mind be turned into an inanimate object of nature like a
stone or a piece of wood; when a state of perfect motionlessness and
unawareness is obtained all the signs of life will depart and also every
trace of limitation will vanish. Not a single idea will disturb your
consciousness, when lo! all of a sudden you will come to realize a light
abounding in full gladness. It is like coming across a light in thick
darkness; it is like receiving treasure in poverty. The four elements
and the five aggregates are no more felt as burdens; so light, so easy,
so free you are. Your very existence has been delivered from all
limitations; you have become open, light, and transparent. You gain an
illuminating insight into the very nature of things, which now appear to
you as so many fairylike flowers having no graspable realities. Here is
manifested the unsophisticated self which is the original face of your
being; here is shown all bare the most beautiful landscape of your
birthplace. There is but one straight passage open and unobstructed
through and through. This is so when you surrender all---your body, your
life, and all that belongs to your inmost self. This is where you gain
peace, ease, nondoing, and inexpressible delight. All the sutras and
sastras are no more than communications of this fact; all the sages,
ancient as well as modern, have exhausted their ingenuity and
imagination to no other purpose than to point the way to this. It is
like unlocking the door to a treasury; when the entrance is once gained,
every object coming into your view is yours, every opportunity that
presents itself is available for your use; for are they not, however
multitudinous, all possessions obtainable within the original being of
yourself? Every treasure there is but waiting your pleasure and
utilization. This is what is meant by 'Once gained, eternally gained,
even unto the end of time.' Yet really there is nothing gained; what you
have gained is no gain, and yet there is something truly gained in
this."

I[N]{.small} the history of Zen, Yeno
(Hui-neng,[]{#calibre_link-154}[^1^](#calibre_link-68) 638-713),
traditionally considered the Sixth Patriarch of the Zen sect in China,
cuts a most important figure. In fact, he is the founder of Zen as
distinguished from the other Buddhist sects then existing in China. The
standard set up by him as the true expression of Zen faith is this
stanza:

> The Bodhi (True Wisdom) is not like the tree;

> The mirror bright is nowhere shining:

> As there is nothing from the first,

> Where does the dust itself collect?

::: calibre15
 
:::

This was written in answer to a stanza composed by another Zen monk who
claimed to have understood the faith in its purity. His lines run thus:

> This body is the Bodhi-tree;

> The soul is like the mirror bright;

> Take heed to keep it always clean,

> And let no dust collect upon it.

They were both the disciples of the Fifth Patriarch, Gunin (Hung-jen,
died 675); and he thought that Yeno rightly comprehended the spirit of
Zen, and, therefore, was worthy of wearing his mantle and carrying his
bowl as his true successor in Zen. This recognition by the master of the
signification of the first stanza by Yeno stamps it as the orthodox
expression of Zen faith. As it seems to breathe the spirit of
nothingness, many people regard Zen as advocating nihilism. The purpose
of the present chapter is to refute this.

It is true there are many passages in Zen literature which may be
construed as conveying a nihilistic doctrine; for example, the theory of
Sunyata (emptiness).[]{#calibre_link-155}[^2^](#calibre_link-69) Even
among those scholars who are well acquainted with the general teaching
of Mahayana Buddhism, some still ding to the view that Zen is the
practical application of the "Sanron" (*san-lun*) philosophy, otherwise
known as the Madhyamika school. *Sanron* means the "three treatises",
which are Nagarjuna's *Madhyamika Sastra* and *The Discourse of Twelve
Sections*, and Deva's *Discourse of One Hundred Stanzas*. They comprise
all the essential doctrines of this school. Nagarjuna is thought to be
its founder, and as the Mahayana sutras classified under the head of
Prajnaparamita expound more or less similar views, the philosophy of
this school is sometimes designated as the Prajna doctrine. Zen,
therefore, they think, practically belongs to this class; in other
words, the ultimate signification of Zen would be the upholding of the
Sunyata system.

To a certain extent, superficially at least, this view is justifiable.
For instance, read the following:

"I come here to seek the truth of Buddhism," a disciple asked a master.

"Why do you seek such a thing here?" answered the master. "Why do you
wander about, neglecting your own precious treasure at home? I have
nothing to give you, and what truth of Buddhism do you desire to find in
my monastery? There is nothing, absolutely nothing."

A master would sometimes say: "I do not understand Zen. I have nothing
here to demonstrate; therefore, do not remain standing so, expecting to
get something out of nothing. Get enlightened by yourself, if you will.
If there is anything to take hold of, take it by yourself."

Again: "True knowledge (*bodhi*) transcends all modes of expression.
There has been nothing from the very beginning which one can claim as
having attained towards enlightenment."

Or: "In Zen there is nothing to explain by means of words, there is
nothing to be given out as a holy doctrine. Thirty blows whether you
affirm or negate. Do not remain silent; nor be discursive."

The question "How can one always be with Buddha?" called forth the
following answer from a master: "Have no stirrings in your mind; be
perfectly serene toward the objective world. To remain thus all the time
in absolute emptiness and calmness is the way to be with the Buddha."

Sometimes we come across the following: "The middle way is where there
is neither middle nor two sides. When you are fettered by the objective
world, you have one side; when you are disturbed in your own mind, you
have the other side. When neither of these exists, there is no middle
part, and this is the middle way."

A Japanese Zen master who flourished several hundred years ago used to
say to his disciples, who would implore him to instruct them in the way
to escape the fetters of birth-and-death, "Here is no birth-and-death."

Bodhidharma (Daruma, J.; Tamo, C), the First Patriarch of the Zen sect
in China, was asked by Wu, the first Emperor (reigned [A .D]{.small}.
502-549) of the Liang dynasty, as to the ultimate and holiest principle
of Buddhism. The sage is reported to have answered, "Vast emptiness and
nothing holy in it."

These are passages taken at random from the vast store of Zen
literature, and they seem to be permeated with the ideas of emptiness
(*sunyata*), nothingness (*nasti*), quietude (*santi*), no-thought
(*acinta*), and other similar notions, all of which we may regard as
nihilistic or as advocating negative quietism.

A quotation from the *Prajnaparamita-Hridaya
Sutra*[]{#calibre_link-156}[^3^](#calibre_link-70) may prove to be more
astounding than any of the above passages. In fact, all the sutras
belonging to this Prajna class of Mahayana literature are imbued
thoroughly with the idea of Sunyata, and those who are not familiar with
this way of thinking will be taken aback and may not know how to express
their judgment. This sutra, considered to be the most concise and most
comprehensive of all the Prajna sutras, is daily recited in the Zen
monasteries; in fact it is the first thing the monks recite in the
morning as well as before each meal.

"Thus, Sariputra, all things have the character of emptiness, they have
no beginning, no end, they are faultless and not faultless, they are not
perfect and not imperfect. Therefore, O Sariputra, here in this
emptiness there is no form, no perception, no name, no concepts, no
knowledge. No eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind. No
form, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no objects. ... There is
no knowledge, no ignorance, no destruction of ignorance. ... There is no
decay nor death; there are no four truths, viz. there is no pain, no
origin of pain, no stoppage of pain, and no path to the stoppage of
pain. There is no knowledge of Nirvana, no obtaining of it, no
not-obtaining of it. Therefore, O Sariputra, as there is no obtaining of
Nirvana, a man who has approached the Prajnaparamita of the Bodhisattvas
dwells unimpeded in consciousness. When the impediments of consciousness
are annihilated, then he becomes free of all fear, is beyond the reach
of change, enjoying final Nirvana."

Going through all these quotations, it may be thought that the critics
are justified in charging Zen with advocating a philosophy of pure
negation, but nothing is so far from Zen as this criticism would imply.
For Zen always aims at grasping the central fact of life, which can
never be brought to the dissecting table of the intellect. To grasp this
central fact of life, Zen is forced to propose a series of negations.
Mere negation, however, is not the spirit of Zen, but as we are so
accustomed to the dualistic way of thinking, this intellectual error
must be cut at its root. Naturally Zen would proclaim, "Not this, not
that, not anything." But we may insist upon asking Zen what it Is that
is left after all these denials, and the master will perhaps on such an
occasion give us a slap in the face, exclaiming, "You fool, what is
this?" Some may take this as only an excuse to get away from the
dilemma, or as having no more meaning than a practical example of
ill-breeding. But when the spirit of Zen is grasped in its purity, it
will be seen what a real thing that slap is. For here is no negation, no
affirmation, but a plain fact, a pure experience, the very foundation of
our being and thought. All the quietness and emptiness one might desire
in the midst of most active mentation lies therein. Do not be carried
away by anything outward or conventional. Zen must be seized with bare
hands, with no gloves on.

Zen is forced to resort to negation because of our innate ignorance
(*avidya*), which tenaciously clings to the mind as wet clothes do to
the body. "Ignorance"[]{#calibre_link-157}[^4^](#calibre_link-71) is all
very well as far as it goes, but it must not go out of its proper
sphere. "Ignorance" is another name for logical dualism. White is snow
and black is the raven. But these belong to the world and its ignorant
way of talking. If we want to get to the very truth of things, we must
see them from the point where this world has not yet been created, where
the consciousness of this and that has not yet been awakened and where
the mind is absorbed in its own identity, that is, in its serenity and
emptiness. This is a world of negations but leading to a higher or
absolute affirmation---an affirmation in the midst of negations. Snow is
not white, the raven is not black, yet each in itself is white or black.
This is where our everyday language fails to convey the exact meaning as
conceived by Zen.

Apparently Zen negates; but it is always holding up before us something
which indeed lies right before our own eyes; and if we do not pick it up
by ourselves, it is our own fault. Most people, whose mental vision is
darkened by the clouds of ignorance, pass it by and refuse to look at
it. To them Zen is, indeed, nihilism just because they do not see it.
When Obaku (Huang-po, died 850) was paying reverence to the Buddha in
the sanctuary, a pupil of his approached and said, "When Zen says not to
seek it through the Buddha, nor through the Dharma, nor through the
Sangha, why do you bow to the Buddha as if wishing to get something by
this pious act?"

"I do not seek it," answered the master, "through the Buddha, nor
through the Dharma, nor through the Sangha; I just go on doing this act
of piety to the Buddha."

The disciple grunted, "What is the use, anyway, of looking so
sanctimonious?"

The master gave him a slap in the face, whereupon the disciple said,
"How rude you are!"

"Do you know where you are," exclaimed the master; "here I have no time
to consider for your sake what rudeness or politeness means." With this
another slap was given.

Intelligent readers will see in this attitude of Obaku something he is
anxious to communicate in spite of his apparent brusqueness to his
disciple. He forbids outwardly, and yet in the spirit he is affirming.
This must be comprehended if Zen is to be at all understood.

The attitude of Zen towards the formal worship of God may be gleaned
more clearly from Joshu's (Chao-chou, 778-897) remarks given to a monk
who was bowing reverently before Buddha. When Joshu slapped the monk,
the latter said, "Is it not a laudable thing to pay respect to Buddha?"
"Yes," answered the master, "but it is better to go without even a
laudable thing." Does this attitude savour of anything nihilistic and
iconoclastic? Superficially, yes; but let us dive deep into the spirit
of Joshu out of the depths of which this utterance comes, and we will
find ourselves confronting an absolute affirmation quite beyond the ken
of our discursive understanding.

Hakuin (1685-1768), the founder of modem Japanese Zen, while still a
young monk eagerly bent on the mastery of Zen, had an interview with the
venerable Shoju. Hakuin thought that he fully comprehended Zen and was
proud of his attainment, and this interview with Shoju was in fact
intended to be a demonstration of his own high understanding. Shoju
asked him how much he knew of Zen. Hakuin answered disgustingly, "If
there is anything I can lay my hand on, I will get it all out of me." So
saying, he acted as if he were going to vomit. Shoju took firm hold of
Hakuin's nose and said: "What is this? Have I not after all touched it?"
Let our readers ponder with Hakuin over this interview and find out for
themselves what is that something which is so realistically demonstrated
by Shoju.

Zen is not all negation, leaving the mind all blank as if it were pure
nothing; for that would be intellectual suicide. There is in Zen
something self-assertive, which, however, being free and absolute, knows
no limitations and refuses to be handled in abstraction. Zen is a live
fact, it is not like an inorganic rock or like an empty space. To come
into contact with this living fact---nay, to take hold of it in every
phase of life---is the aim of all Zen discipline.

Nansen (Nan-chuan, 748-834) was once asked by Hyakujo (Pai-chang,
720-814), one of his brother monks, if there was anything he dared not
talk about to others. The master answered, "Yes."

Whereupon the monk continued, "What then is this something you do not
talk about?"

The master's reply was, "It is neither mind, nor Buddha, nor matter."

This looks to be the doctrine of absolute emptiness, but even here again
we observe a glimpse of something showing itself through the negation.
Observe the further dialogue that took place between the two. The monk
said:

"If so, you have already talked about it."

"I cannot do any better. What would you say?"

"I am not a great enlightened one," answered Hyakujo.

The master said, "Well, I have already said too much about it."

This state of inner consciousness, about which we cannot make any
logical statement, must be realized before we can have any intelligent
talk on Zen. Words are only an index to this state; through them we are
enabled to get into its signification, but do not look to words for
absolute guidance. Try to see first of all in what mental state the Zen
masters are so acting. They are not carrying on all those seeming
absurdities, or, as some might say, those silly trivialities, just to
suit their capricious moods. They have a certain firm basis of truth
obtained from a deep personal experience. There is in all their
seemingly crazy performances a systematic demonstration of the most
vital truth. When seen from this truth, even the moving of the whole
universe is of no more account than the flying of a mosquito or the
waving of a fan. The thing is to see one spirit working throughout all
these, which is an absolute affirmation, with not a particle of nihilism
in it.

A monk asked Joshu, "What would you say when I come to you with
nothing?"

Joshu said, "Fling it down to the ground."

Protested the monk, "I said that I had nothing; what shall I let go?"

"If so, carry it away," was the retort of Joshu.

Joshu has thus plainly exposed the fruitlessness of a nihilistic
philosophy. To reach the goal of Zen, even the idea of "having nothing"
ought to be done away with. Buddha reveals himself when he is no more
asserted; that is, for Buddha's sake Buddha is to be given up. This is
the only way to come to the realization of the truth of Zen. So long as
one is talking of nothingness or of the absolute one is far away from
Zen, and ever receding from Zen. Even the foothold of Sunyata must be
kicked off. The only way to get saved is to throw oneself right down
into a bottomless abyss. And this is, indeed, no easy task.

"No Buddhas," it is boldly asserted by Yengo (see p. 16), "have ever
appeared on earth; nor is there anything that is to be given out as a
holy doctrine. Bodhidharma, the First Patriarch of Zen, has never come
east, nor has he ever transmitted any secret doctrine through the mind;
only people of the world, not understanding what all this means, seek
the truth outside of themselves. What a pity that the thing they are so
earnestly looking for is being trodden under their own feet! This is not
to be grasped by the wisdom of all the sages. However, we see the thing
and yet it is not seen; we hear it and yet it is not heard; we talk
about it and yet it is not talked about; we know it and yet it is not
known. Let me ask, How does it so happen?"

Is this an interrogation as it apparently is? Or, in fact, is it an
affirmative statement describing a certain definite attitude of mind?

Therefore, when Zen denies, it is not necessarily a denial in the
logical sense. The same can be said of an affirmation. The idea is that
the ultimate fact of experience must not be enslaved by any artificial
or schematic laws of thought, nor by any antithesis of "yes" and "no",
nor by any cut and dried formulae of epistemology. Evidently Zen commits
absurdities and irrationalities all the time; but this only apparently.
No wonder it fails to escape the natural
consequences---misunderstandings, wrong interpretations, and ridicules
which are often malicious. The charge of nihilism is only one of these.

When Vimalakirti asked Manjusri what was the doctrine of non-duality as
realized by a Bodhisattva, Manjusri replied: "As I understand it, the
doctrine is realized when one looks upon all things as beyond every form
of expression and demonstration and as transcending knowledge and
argument. This is my comprehension; may I ask what is your
understanding?" Vimalakirti, thus demanded, remained altogether silent.
The mystic response---that is, the closing of the lips---seems to be the
only way one can get out of the difficulties in which Zen often finds
itself involved, when it is pressed hard for a statement. Therefore,
Yengo (Yuan-wu), commenting on the above, has this to say:

"I say, 'yes', and there is nothing about which this affirmation is
made; I say, 'no', and there is nothing about which this is made. I
stand above 'yes' and 'no', I forget what is gained and what is lost.
There is just a state of absolute purity, a state of stark nakedness.
Tell me what you have left behind and what you see before. A monk may
come out of the assembly and say, 'I see the Buddha-hall and the temple
gate before me, my sleeping cell and living room behind.' Has this man
an inner eye opened? When you can discriminate him, I will admit that
you really have had a personal interview with the ancient sages."

When silence does not avail, shall we say, after Yengo, "The gate of
Heaven opens above, and an unquenched fire burns below"? Does this make
clear the ultimate signification of Zen, as not choked by the dualism of
"yes" and "no"? Indeed, so long as there remains the last trace of
consciousness as to this and that, *meum et tuum*, none can come to a
fuller realization of Zen, and the sages of old will appear as those
with whom we have nothing in common. The inner treasure will remain
forever unearthed.

A monk asked, "According to Vimalakirti, one who wishes for the Pure
Land ought to have his mind purified; but what is the purified mind?"
Answered the Zen master: "When the mind is absolutely pure, you have a
purified mind, and a mind is said to be absolutely pure when it is above
purity and impurity. You want to know how this is to be realized? Have
your mind thoroughly void in all conditions, then you will have purity.
But when this is attained, do not harbour any thought of it, or you get
non-purity. Again, when this state of non-purity is attained, do not
harbour any thought of it, and you are free of non-purity. This is
absolute purity." Now, absolute purity is absolute affirmation, as it is
above purity and non-purity and at the same time unifies them in a
higher form of synthesis. There is no negation in this, nor any
contradiction. What Zen aims at is to realize this form of unification
in one's everyday life of actualities, and not to treat life as a sort
of metaphysical exercise. In this light all Zen "Questions and Answers"
(*Mondo*) are to be considered. There are no quibblings, no playing at
words, no sophistry; Zen is the most serious concern in the world.

Let me conclude this chapter with the following
quotation[]{#calibre_link-158}[^5^](#calibre_link-72) from one of the
earliest Zen writings. Doko (Tao-kwang), a Buddhist philosopher and a
student of the Vijnaptimatra (absolute idealism), came to a Zen master
and asked:

"With what frame of mind should one discipline oneself in the truth?"

Said the Zen master, "There is no mind to be framed, nor is there any
truth in which to be disciplined."

"If there is no mind to be framed and no truth in which to be
disciplined, why do you have a daily gathering of monks who are studying
Zen and disciplining themselves in the truth?"

The master replied: "I have not an inch of space to spare, and where
could I have a gathering of monks? I have no tongue, and how would it be
possible for me to advise others to come to me?"

The philosopher then exclaimed, "How can you tell me a lie like that to
my face?"

"When I have no tongue to advise others, is it possible for me to tell a
lie?"

Said Doko despairingly, "I cannot follow your reasoning."

"Neither do I understand myself," concluded the Zen master.

> Empty-handed go, and behold the spade is\

> When I pass over the bridge,

> Lo, the water floweth not, but the bridge doth flow.

T[HIS]{.small} is the famous gatha of Jenye (Shan-hui, [A.D]{.small}.
497--469), who is commonly known as Fudaishi (Fu-tai-shih) and it
summarily gives the point of view as entertained by the followers of
Zen. Though it by no means exhausts all that Zen teaches, it indicates
graphically the way toward which Zen tends. Those who desire to gain an
intellectual insight, if possible, into the truth of Zen, must first
understand what this stanza really means.

Nothing can be more illogical and contrary to common sense than these
four lines. The critic will be inclined to call Zen absurd, confusing,
and beyond the ken of ordinary reasoning. But Zen is inflexible and
would protest that the so-called common-sense way of looking at things
is not final, and that the reason why we cannot attain to a
thoroughgoing comprehension of the truth is due to our unreasonable
adherence to a "logical" interpretation of things. If we really want to
get to the bottom of life, we must abandon our cherished syllogisms, we
must acquire a new way of observation whereby we can escape the tyranny
of logic and the one-sidedness of our everyday phraseology. However
paradoxical it may seem, Zen insists that the spade must be held in your
empty hands, and that it is not the water but the bridge that is flowing
under your feet.

These are not, however, the only irrational statements Zen makes. There
are many more equally staggering ones. Some may declare Zen irrevocably
insane or silly. Indeed, what would our readers say to such assertions
as the following?

"When Tom drinks, Dick gets tipsy."

"Who is the teacher of all the Buddhas, past, present, and future? John
the cook."

"Last night a wooden hone neighed and a stone man cut capers."

"Lo, a cloud of dust is rising from the ocean, and the roaring of the
waves is heard over the land."

Sometimes Zen will ask you such questions as the following:

"It is pouring now; how would you stop it?"

"When both hands are clapped a sound is produced: listen to the sound of
one hand."

"If you have heard the sound of one hand, can you make me hear it too?"

"When we see about us mountains towering high and seas filling hollow
places, why do we read in the sacred sutras that the Dharma is sameness,
and there is nothing high, nothing low?"

Have the followers of Zen lost their senses? Or are they given up to
deliberate mystification? Have all these statements no inner meaning, no
edifying signification except to produce confusion in our minds? What is
Zen through these apparent trivialities and irrationalities really
driving us to comprehend? The answer is simple. Zen wants us to acquire
an entirely new point of view whereby to look into the mysteries of life
and the secrets of nature. This is because Zen has come to the definite
conclusion that the ordinary logical process of reasoning is powerless
to give final satisfaction to our deepest spiritual needs.

We generally think that "A is A" is absolute, and that the proposition
"A is not-A" or "A is B" is unthinkable. We have never been able to
break through these conditions of the understanding; they have been too
imposing. But now Zen declares that words are words and no more. When
words cease to correspond with facts it is time for us to part with
words and return to facts. As long as logic has its practical value it
is to be made use of; but when it fails to work, or when it tries to go
beyond its proper limits, we must cry, "Halt!" Ever since the awakening
of consciousness we have endeavoured to solve the mysteries of being and
to quench our thirst for logic through the dualism of "A" and "not-A";
that is, by calling a bridge a bridge, by making the water flow, and
dust arise from the earth; but to our great disappointment we have never
been able to obtain peace of mind, perfect happiness, and a thorough
understanding of life and the world. We have come, as it were, to the
end of our wits. No further steps could we take which would lead us to a
broader field of reality. The inmost agonies of the soul could not be
expressed in words, when lo! light comes over our entire being. This is
the beginning of Zen. For we now realize that "A is not-A" after all,
that logic is onesided, that illogicality so-called is not in the last
analysis necessarily illogical; what is superficially irrational has
after all its own logic, which is in correspondence with the true state
of things. "Empty-handed I go, and behold the spade is in my hands!" By
this we are made perfectly happy, for strangely this contradiction is
what we have been seeking for all the time ever since the dawning of the
intellect. The dawning of the intellect did not mean the assertion of
the intellect but the transcending of itself. The meaning of the
proposition "A is A" is realized only when "A is not-A". To be itself is
not to be itself---this is the logic of Zen, and satisfies all our
aspirations.

"The flower is not red, the willow is not green." This is regarded by
Zen devotees as most refreshingly satisfying. So long as we think logic
final we are chained, we have no freedom of spirit, and the real facts
of life are lost sight of. Now, however, we have the key to the whole
situation; we are master of realities; words have given up their
domination over us. If we are pleased to call a spade not a spade, we
have the perfect right to do so; a spade need not always remain a spade;
and, moreover, this, according to the Zen master, expresses more
correctly the state of reality which refuses to be tied up to names.

This breaking up of the tyranny of name and logic is at the same time
spiritual emancipation; for the soul is no longer divided against
itself. By acquiring the intellectual freedom the soul is in full
possession of itself; birth and death no longer torment it; for there
are no such dualities anywhere; we live even through death. Hitherto we
have been looking at things in their contradicting and differentiating
aspect, and have assumed an attitude toward them in accordance with that
view, that is, more or less antagonistic. But this has been
revolutionized, we have at last attained the point where the world can
be viewed, as it were, from within. Therefore, "the iron trees are in
full bloom"; and "in the midst of pouring rain I am not wet". The soul
is thus made whole, perfect, and filled with bliss.

Zen deals with facts and not with their logical, verbal, prejudiced, and
lame representations. Direct simplicity is the soul of Zen; hence its
vitality, freedom, and originality. Christianity speaks much of
simplicity of heart, and so do other religions, but this does not always
mean to be simple-hearted or to be a Simple Simon. In Zen it means not
to get entangled in intellectual subtleties, not to be carried away by
philosophical reasoning that is so often ingenuous and full of
sophistry. It means, again, to recognize facts as facts and to know that
words are words and nothing else. Zen often compares the mind to a
mirror free from stains. To be simple, therefore, according to Zen, will
be to keep this mirror always bright and pure and ready to reflect
simply and absolutely whatever comes before it. The result will be to
acknowledge a spade to be a spade and at the same time not to be a
spade. To recognize the first only is a common-sense view, and there is
no Zen until the second is also admitted along with the first. The
common-sense view is flat and tame, whereas that of Zen is always
original and stimulating. Each time Zen is asserted things get
vitalized; there is an act of creation.

Zen thinks we are too much of slaves to words and logic. So long as we
remain thus fettered we are miserable and go through untold suffering.
But if we want to see something really worth knowing, that is conducive
to our spiritual happiness, we must endeavour once for all to free
ourselves from all conditions; we must see if we cannot gain a new point
of view from which the world can be surveyed in its wholeness and life
comprehended inwardly. This consideration has compelled one to plunge
oneself deep into the abyss of the "Nameless" and take hold directly of
the spirit as it is engaged in the business of creating the world. Here
is no logic, no philosophizing; here is no twisting of facts to suit our
artificial measures; here is no murdering of human nature in order to
submit it to intellectual dissections; the one spirit stands face to
face with the other spirit like two mirrors facing each other, and there
is nothing to intervene between their mutual reflections.

In this sense Zen is pre-eminently practical. It has nothing to do with
abstractions or with subtleties of dialectics. It seizes the spade lying
in front of you, and holding it forth, makes the bold declaration, "I
hold a spade, yet I hold it not." No reference is made to God or to the
soul; there is no talk about the infinite or a life after death. This
handling of a homely spade, a most ordinary thing to see about us, opens
all the secrets we encounter in life. And nothing more is wanted. Why?
Because Zen has now cleared up a new approach to the reality of things.
When a humble flower in the crannied wall is understood, the whole
universe and all things in it and out of it are understood. In Zen the
spade is the key to the whole riddle. How fresh and full of life it
is---the way Zen grapples with the knottiest questions of philosophy!

A noted Christian Father of the early Middle Ages once exclaimed: "O
poor Aristotle! Thou who has discovered for the heretics the art of
dialectics, the art of building up and destroying, the art of discussing
all things and accomplishing nothing!" So much ado about nothing,
indeed! See how philosophers of all ages contradict one another after
spending all their logical acumen and analytical ingenuity on the
so-called problems of science and knowledge. No wonder the same old wise
man, wanting to put a stop once for all to all such profitless
discussions, has boldly thrown the following bomb right into the midst
of those sand-builders: *"Certum est quia impossible est";* or, more
logically, *"Credo quia absurdum est."* I believe because it is
irrational; is this not an unqualified confirmation of Zen?

An old master brought out his stick before an assemblage of monks and
said: "O monks, do you see this? If you see it, what is it you see?
Would you say, 'It is a stick'? If you do you are ordinary people, you
have no Zen. But if you say, 'We do not see any stick,' then I would
say, 'Here I hold one, and how can you deny the fact?'" There is no
trifling in Zen. Until you have a third eye opened to see into the
inmost secret of things, you cannot be in the company of the ancient
sages. What is this third eye that sees the stick and yet sees it not?
Where does one get this illogical apprehension of things?

Zen says, "Buddha preached forty-nine years and yet his 'broad tongue'
(*tanujihva*) never once moved." Can one talk without moving one's
tongue? Why this absurdity? The explanation given by Gensha (Hsuan-sha,
831--908) follows: "All those piously inclined profess to bless others
in every possible way; but when they come across three kinds of
invalids, how would they treat them? The blind cannot see even if a
stick or a mallet is produced; the deaf cannot hear however fine the
preaching may be; and the dumb cannot talk however much they are urged
to do so. But if these people severally suffering cannot somehow be
benefited, what good is there after all in Buddhism?" The explanation
does not seem to explain anything after all. Perhaps Butsugen's (Fo-yen)
comment may throw more light on the subject. He said to his disciplies:
"You each have a pair of ears; what have you ever heard with them? You
each have one tongue; what have you ever preached with it? Indeed, you
have never talked, you have never heard, you have never seen. From
whence then do all these forms, voices, odours, and tastes come?" (That
is to say, where does this world come from?)

If this remark still leaves us where we were before, let us see whether
Ummon (Yun-men, died 966), one of the greatest of Zen masters who ever
lived, can help us. A monk came to Ummon and asked to be enlightened
upon the above remark by Gensha. Ummon ordered him first to salute him
in the formal way. When the monk stood up after prostrating himself on
the ground, Ummon pushed him with his stick, and the monk stepped back.
The master said, "You are not blind, then." He now told the monk to come
forward, which he did. The master said, "You are not deaf, then." He
finally asked the monk if he understood what all this was about, and the
latter replied, "No, sir." Ummon then concluded, "You are not dumb,
then."

With all these comments and gestures, are we still travelling through a
*terra incognita?* If so, there is no other way but to go back to the
beginning and repeat the stanza:

> Empty-handed I go, and behold the spade is in my hands;

> I walk on foot, and yet on the back of an ox I am riding;

A few more words: the reason why Zen is so vehement in its attack on
logic, and why the present work treats first of the illogical aspect of
Zen, is that logic has so pervasively entered into life as to make most
of us conclude that logic is life and without it life has no
significance. The map of life has been so definitely and so thoroughly
delineated by logic that what we have to do is simply to follow it, and
that we ought not to think of violating the laws of thought, which are
final. Such a general view of life has come to be held by most people,
though I must say that in point of fact they are constantly violating
what they think inviolable. That is to say, they are "holding a spade
and yet not holding it", they are making the sum of two and two
sometimes three, sometimes five; only they are not conscious of this
fact and imagine that their lives are logically or mathematically
regulated. Zen wishes to storm this citadel of topsy-turvydom and to
show that we live psychologically or biologically and not logically.

In logic there is a trace of effort and pain; logic is self-conscious.
So is ethics, which is the application of logic to the facts of life. An
ethical man performs acts of service which are praiseworthy, but he is
all the time conscious of them, and, moreover, he may often be thinking
of some future reward. Hence we should say that his mind is tainted and
not at all pure, however objectively or socially good his deeds are. Zen
abhors this. Life is an art, and like perfect art it should be
self-forgetting; there ought not to be any trace of effort or painful
feeling. Life, according to Zen, ought to be lived as a bird flies
through the air or as a fish swims in the water. As soon as there are
signs of elaboration, a man is doomed, he is no more a free being. You
are not living as you ought to live, you are suffering under the tyranny
of circumstances; you are feeling a constraint of some sort, and you
lose your independence. Zen aims at preserving your vitality, your
native freedom, and above all the completeness of your being. In other
words, Zen wants to live from within. Not to be bound by rules, but to
be creating one's own rules---this is the kind of life which Zen is
trying to have us live. Hence its illogical, or rather superlogical,
statements.

In one of his sermons a Zen
master[]{#calibre_link-160}[^1^](#calibre_link-74) declares: "The sutras
preached by the Buddha during his lifetime are said to amount to five
thousand and forty-eight fascicles; they include the doctrine of
emptiness and the doctrine of being; there are teachings of immediate
realization and of gradual development. Is this not an affirmation?

"But, according to Yoka,[]{#calibre_link-161}[^2^](#calibre_link-75)
'There are no sentient beings, there are no Buddhas; sages as numerous
as the sands of the Ganges are but so many bubbles in the sea; sages and
worthies of the past are like flashes of lightning.' Is this not a
negation?

"O you, my disciples, if you say there is, you go against Yoka; if you
say there is not, you contradict our old master Buddha. If he were with
us, then how would he pass through the dilemma? If you know, however,
just exactly where we are, we shall be interviewing Buddha in the
morning and saluting him in the evening. If, on the other hand, you
confess your ignorance, I will let you see into the secret. When I say
there is not, this does not necessarily mean a negation; when I say
there is, this also does not signify an affirmation. Turn eastward and
look at the Western Land; face the south and the North Star is pointed
out there!"

S[HUZAN]{.small} (Shou-shan, 926--992) once held up his
*shippe*[]{#calibre_link-163}[^1^](#calibre_link-77) to an assembly of
his disciples and declared: "Call this a *shippe* and you assert; call
it not a *shippe* and you negate. Now, do not assert nor negate, and
what would you call it? Speak, speak!" One of the disciples came out of
the ranks, took the *shippe* away from the master, and breaking it in
two, exclaimed, "What is this?"

To those who are used to dealing with abstractions and high subjects
this may appear to be quite a trivial matter, for what have they, deep
learned philosophers, to do with an insignificant piece of bamboo? How
does it concern those scholars who are absorbed in deep meditation,
whether it is called a bamboo stick or not, whether it is broken, or
thrown on the floor? But to the followers of Zen this declaration by
Shuzan is pregnant with meaning. Let us really realize the state of his
mind in which he proposed this question, and we have attained our first
entrance into the realm of Zen. There were many Zen masters who followed
Shuzan's example, and, holding forth their *shippe*, demanded of their
pupils a satisfactory answer.

To speak in the abstract, which perhaps will be more acceptable to most
readers, the idea is to reach a higher affirmation than the logical
antithesis of assertion and denial. Ordinarily, we dare not go beyond an
antithesis just because we imagine we cannot. Logic has so intimidated
us that we shrink and shiver whenever its name is mentioned. The mind
made to work, ever since the awakening of the intellect, under the
strictest discipline of logical dualism, refuses to shake off its
imaginary cangue. It has never occurred to us that it is possible for us
to escape this self-imposed intellectual limitation; indeed, unless we
break through the antithesis of "yes" and "no" we can never hope to live
a real life of freedom. And the soul has always been crying for it,
forgetting that it is not after all so very difficult to reach a higher
form of affirmation, where no contradicting distinctions obtain between
negation and assertion. It is due to Zen that this higher affirmation
has finally been reached by means of a stick of bamboo in the hand of
the Zen master.

It goes without saying that this stick thus brought forward can be any
one of myriads of things existing in this world of particulars. In this
stick we find all possible existences and also all our possible
experiences concentrated. When we know it--- this homely piece of
bamboo---we know the whole story in a most thoroughgoing manner. Holding
it in my hand, I hold the whole universe. Whatever statement I make
about it is also made of everything else. When one point is gained, all
other points go with it. As the Avatamsaka (Kegon) philosophy teaches:
"The One embraces All, and All is merged in the One. The One is All, and
All is the One. The One pervades All, and All is in the One. This is so
with every object, with every existence." But, mind you, here is no
pantheism, nor the theory of identity. For when the stick of bamboo is
held out before you it is just the stick, there is no universe
epitomized in it, no All, no One; even when it is stated that "I see the
stick" or that "Here is a stick," we all miss the mark. Zen is no more
there, much less the philosophy of the Avatamsaka.

I spoke of the illogicalness of Zen in one of the preceding chapters;
the reader will now know why Zen stands in opposition to logic, formal
or informal. It is not the object of Zen to look illogical for its own
sake, but to make people know that logical consistency is not final, and
that there is a certain transcendental statement that cannot be attained
by mere intellectual cleverness. The intellectual groove of "yes" and
"no" is quite accommodating when things run their regular course; but as
soon as the ultimate question of life comes up, the intellect fails to
answer it satisfactorily. When we say "yes", we assert, and by asserting
we limit ourselves. When we say "no", we deny, and to deny is exclusion.
Exclusion and limitation, which after all are the same thing, murder the
soul; for is it not the life of the soul that lives in perfect freedom
and in perfect unity? There is no freedom or unity in exclusion or in
limitation. Zen is well aware of this. In accordance with the demands of
our inner life, therefore, Zen takes us to an absolute realm wherein
there are no antitheses of any sort.

We must remember, however, that we live in affirmation and not in
negation, for life is affirmation itself; and this affirmation must not
be the one accompanied or conditioned by a negation; such an affirmation
is relative and not at all absolute. With such an affirmation life loses
its creative originality and turns into a mechanical process grinding
forth nothing but soulless flesh and bones. To be free, life must be an
absolute affirmation. It must transcend all possible conditions,
limitations, and antitheses that hinder its free activity. When Shuzan
held forth his stick of bamboo, what he wanted of his disciples was for
them to understand and realize this form of absolute affirmation. Any
answer is satisfactory if it flows out of one's inmost being, for such
is always an absolute affirmation. Therefore, Zen does not mean a mere
escape from intellectual imprisonment, which sometimes ends in sheer
wantonness. There is something in Zen that frees us from conditions and
at the same time gives us a certain firm foothold, which, however, is
not a foothold in a relative sense. The Zen master endeavours to take
away all footholds from the disciple which he has ever had since his
first appearance on earth, and then to supply him with one that is
really no foothold. If the stick of bamboo is not to the purpose,
anything that comes handy will be made use of. Nihilism is not Zen, for
this bamboo stick or anything else cannot be done away with as words and
logic can. Thip is the point we must not overlook in the study of Zen.

Some examples will be given for illustration. Toku-san (Teh-shan,
780--865) used to swing his big stick whenever he came out to preach in
the hall, saying, "If you utter a word I will give you thirty blows; if
you utter not a word, just the same, thirty blows on your head." This
was all he would say to his disciples. No lengthy talk on religion or
morality; no abstract discourse, no hair-splitting metaphysics; on the
contrary, quite roughshod riding. To those who associate religion with
pusillanimity and sanctimoniousness the Zen master must appear a
terribly unpolished fellow. But when facts are handled as facts, without
any intermediary, they are generally rude things. We must squarely face
them, for no amount of winking or evading will be of any avail. The
inner eye is to be opened under a shower of thirty blows. An absolute
affirmation must rise from the fiery crater of life itself.

Hoyen (Fa-yen, died 1104), of Gosozan (Wu-tsu-shan), once asked, "When
you meet a wise man on your way, if you do not speak to him or remain
silent, how would you interview him?" The point is to make one realize
what I call an absolute affirmation. Not merely to escape the antithesis
of "yes" and "no", but to find a positive way in which the opposites are
perfectly harmonized---this is what is aimed at in this question. A
master once pointed to a live charcoal and said to his disciples, "I
call this fire, but you call it not so; tell me what it is." The same
thing here again. The master intends to free his disciples' minds from
the bondage of logic, which has ever been the bane of humanity.

This ought not to be regarded as a riddle proposed to puzzle you. There
is nothing playful about it; if you fail to answer, you are to face the
consequences. Are you going to be eternally chained by your own laws of
thought, or are you going to be perfectly free in an assertion of life
which knows no beginning or end? You cannot hesitate. Grasp the fact or
let it slip--- between these there is no choice. The Zen method of
discipline generally consists in putting one in a dilemma, out of which
one must contrive to escape, not through logic indeed, but through a
mind of higher order.

Yakusan (Yueh-shan, 751--834) studied Zen first under Sekito (Shih-t'ou,
700--790) and asked him: "As to the three divisions and twelve
departments of Buddhism, I am not altogether unacquainted with them, but
I have no knowledge whatever concerning the doctrine of Zen as taught in
the South.[]{#calibre_link-164}[^2^](#calibre_link-78) Its followers
assert it to be the doctrine of directly pointing at the mind and
attaining Buddhahood through a perception of its real nature. If this is
so, how may I be enlightened?" Sekito replied: "Assertion prevails not,
nor does denial. When neither of them is to the point, what would you
say?" Yakusan remained meditative, as he did not grasp the meaning of
the question. The master then told him to go to Badaishi (Ma Tai-shih)
of Chiang-hsi, who might be able to open the monk's eye to the truth of
Zen. Thereupon, the monk Yakusan went to the new teacher with the same
problem. His answer was, "I sometimes make one raise the eyebrows, or
wink, while at other times to do so is altogether wrong." Yakusan at
once comprehended the ultimate purport of this remark. When Baso asked,
"What makes you come to this?" Yakusan replied, "When I was with Sekito,
it was like a mosquito biting at an iron bull." Was this a satisfactory
reason or explanation? How strange this so-called affirmation!

Riko (Li K'u), a high government officer of the T'ang dynasty, asked
Nansen (Nan-chuan): "A long time ago a man kept a goose in a bottle. It
grew larger and larger until it could not get out of the bottle any
more; he did not want to break the bottle, nor did he wish to hurt the
goose; how would you get it out?" The master called out, "O
Officer!"---to which Riko at once responded, "Yes!" "There, it is out!"
This was the way Nansen produced the goose out of its imprisonment. Did
Riko get his higher affirmation?

Kyogen (Hsiang-yen)[]{#calibre_link-165}[^3^](#calibre_link-79) said:
"Suppose a man climbing up a tree takes hold of a branch by his teeth,
and his whole body is thus suspended. His hands are not holding anything
and his feet are off the ground. Now another man comes along and asks
the man in the tree as to the fundamental principle of Buddhism. If the
man in the tree does not answer, he is neglecting the questioner; but if
he tries to answer he will lose his life; how can he get out of his
predicament?" While this is put in the form of a fable its purport is
like those already mentioned. If you open your mouth trying to affirm or
to negate, you are lost. Zen is no more there. But merely remaining
silent will not do, either. A stone lying there is silent, a flower in
bloom under the window is silent, but neither of them understands Zen.
There must be a certain way in which silence and eloquence become
identical, that is, where negation and assertion are unified in a higher
form of statement. When we attain to this we know Zen.

What, then, is an absolute affirmative statement? When Hyakujo
(Pai-chang, 720--814) wished to decide who would be the next chief of
Tai-kuei-shan monastery, he called in two of his chief disciples, and
producing a pitcher, which a Buddhist monk generally carries about him,
said to them, "Do not call it a pitcher but tell me what it is." The
first one replied, "It cannot be called a piece of wood." The Abbot did
not consider the reply quite to the mark; thereupon the second one came
forward, lightly pushed the pitcher down, and without making any remark
quietly left the room. He was chosen to be the new abbot, who afterwards
became "the master of one thousand and five hundred monks". Was this
upsetting a pitcher an absolute affirmation? You may repeat this act,
but you will not necessarily be regarded as understanding Zen.

Zen abhors repetition or imitation of any kind, for it kills. For the
same reason Zen never explains, but only affirms. Life is fact and no
explanation is necessary or pertinent. To explain is to apologize, and
why should we apologize for living? To live---is that not enough? Let us
then live, let us affirm! Herein lies Zen in all its purity and in all
its nudity as well.

In the monastery of Nansen monks of the eastern wing quarrelled with
those of the western wing over the possession of a cat. The master
seized it and lifting it before the disputing monks, said, "If any of
you can say something to save the poor animal, I will let it go." As
nobody came forward to utter a word of affirmation, Nansen cut the
object of dispute in two, thus putting an end forever to an unproductive
quarrelling over "yours" and "mine". Later on Joshu (Chao-chou) came
back from an outing and Nansen put the case before him, and asked him
what he would have done to save the animal. Joshu without further ado
took off his straw sandals and, putting them on his head, went out.
Seeing this, Nansen said, "If you were here at the time you would have
saved the cat."

What does all this mean? Why was a poor innocent creature sacrificed?
What has Joshu's placing his sandals over his head to do with the
quarrelling? Did Nansen mean to be irreligious and inhuman by killing a
living being? Was Joshu really a fool to play such a strange trick? And
then "absolute denial" and "absolute affirmation"---are these really
two? There is something fearfully earnest in both these actors, Joshu
and Nansen. Unless this is apprehended, Zen is, indeed, a mere farce.
The cat certainly was not killed to no purpose. If any of the lower
animals is ever to attain Buddhahood, this cat was surely the one so
destined.

The same Joshu was once asked by a monk, "All things are reducible to
the One; where is this One to be reduced?" The master's reply was, "When
I was in Tsin district I had a monk's robe made that weighed seven
*chin.*" This is one of the most noted sayings ever uttered by a Zen
master. One may ask: "Is this what is meant by an absolute affirmation?
What possible connection is there between a monk's robe and the oneness
of things?" Let me ask: You believe that all things exist in God, but
where is the abode of God? Is it in Joshu's seven-*chin* cassock? When
you say that God is here, he can no more be there; but you cannot say
that he is nowhere, for by your definition God is omnipresent. So long
as we are fettered by the intellect, we cannot interview God as he is;
we seek him everywhere, but he ever flies away from us. The intellect
desires to have him located, but it is in his very nature that he cannot
be limited. Here is a great dilemma to put to the intellect, and it is
an inevitable one. How shall we find the way out? Joshu's priestly robe
is not ours; his way of solution cannot be blindly followed, for each of
us must beat out his own track. If someone comes to you with the same
question, how will you answer it? And are we not at every turn of life
confronted with the same problem? And is it not ever pressing for an
immediate and most practical solution?

Gutei's (Chu-chih)[]{#calibre_link-166}[^4^](#calibre_link-80) favourite
response to any question put to him was to lift one of his fingers. His
little boy attendant imitated him, and whenever the boy was asked by
strangers as to the teaching of the master he would lift his finger.
Learning of this, the master one day called the boy in and cut off his
finger. The boy in fright and pain tried to run away, but was called
back, when the master held up his finger. The boy tried to imitate the
master, as was his wont, but the finger was no more there, and then
suddenly the significance of it all dawned upon him. Copying is slavery.
The letter must never be followed, only the spirit is to be grasped.
Higher affirmations live in the spirit. And where is the spirit? Seek it
in your everyday experience, and therein lies abundance of proof for all
you need.

We read in a sutra: "There was an old woman on the east side of the town
who was born when the Buddha was born, and they lived in the same place
throughout all their lives. The old woman did not wish to see the
Buddha; if he ever approached she tried in every way to avoid him,
running up and down, hiding herself hither and thither. But one day,
finding it impossible to flee from him, she covered her face with her
hands, and lo, the Buddha appeared between each of her ten fingers. Let
me ask, 'Who is this old lady?'"

Absolute affirmation is the Buddha; you cannot fly away from it, for it
confronts you at every turn; but somehow you do not recognize it until
you, like Gutei's little boy, lose a finger. It is strange, but the fact
remains that we are like "those who die of hunger while sitting beside
the rice bag", or rather like "those who die of thirst while standing
thoroughly drenched in the midst of the river". One master goes a step
further and says that "We are the rice itself and the water itself." If
so we cannot truthfully say that we are hungry or thirsty, for from the
very beginning nothing has been wanting in us. A monk came to Sozan
(T'sao-shan, 840--901) asking him to be charitable, as he was quite
destitute. Sozan called out, "O my venerable sir!" to which the monk
immediately responded. Then said Sozan, "You have already had three big
bowlfuls of rich home-made *chu* (liquor), and yet you insist that it
has never yet wetted your lips!" Perhaps we are all like this poor
opulent monk; when we are already quite filled up, we never realize the
fact.

To conclude, here is another of the innumerable statements that abound
in Zen literature, absolutely affirming the truth of Zen. Seihei
(Tsing-ping, 845--919) asked Suibi
(T'sui-wei):[]{#calibre_link-167}[^5^](#calibre_link-81)

"What is the fundamental principle of Buddhism?"

"Wait," said Suibi; "when there is no one around I will tell you."

After a while Seihei repeated the request, saying, "There is no one here
now; pray enlighten me."

Coming down from his chair, Suibi took the anxious inquirer into the
bamboo grove, but said nothing. When the latter pressed for a reply,
Suibi whispered: "How high these bamboos are! And how short those over
there!"

S[o FAR]{.small} Zen has been discussed from the intellectual point of
view, in order to see that it is impossible to comprehend Zen through
this channel; in fact it is not doing justice to Zen to treat it thus
philosophically. Zen abhors media, even the intellectual medium; it is
primarily and ultimately a discipline and an experience, which is
dependent on no explanation; for an explanation wastes time and energy
and is never to the point; all that you get out of it is a
misunderstanding and a twisted view of the thing. When Zen wants you to
taste the sweetness of sugar, it will put the required article right
into your mouth and no further words are said. The followers of Zen
would say, A finger is needed to point at the moon, but what a calamity
it would be if one took the finger for the moon! This seems improbable,
but how many times we are committing this form of error we do not know.
Ignorance alone often saves us from being disturbed in our
self-complacency. The business of a writer on Zen, however, cannot go
beyond the pointing at the moon, as this is the only means permitted to
him in the circumstances; and everything that is within his power will
be done to make the subject in hand as thoroughly comprehensible as it
is capable of being so made. When Zen is metaphysically treated, the
reader may get somewhat discouraged about its being at all intelligible,
since most people are not generally addicted to speculation or
introspection. Let me approach it from quite a different point, which is
perhaps more genuinely Zen-like.

When Joshu (Chao-chou) was asked what the Tao (or the truth of Zen) was,
he answered, "Your everyday life, that is the Tao." In other words, a
quiet, self-confident, and trustful existence of your own---this is the
truth of Zen, and what I mean when I say that Zen is pre-eminently
practical. It appeals directly to life, not even making reference to a
soul or to God, or to anything that interferes with or disturbs the
ordinary course of living. The idea of Zen is to catch life as it flows.
There is nothing extraordinary or mysterious about Zen. I raise my hand;
I take a book from the other side of this desk; I hear the boys playing
ball outside my window; I see the clouds blown away beyond the
neighbouring woods:---in all these I am practising Zen, I am living Zen.
No wordy discussion is necessary, nor any explanation. I do not know
why---and there is no need of explaining, but when the sun rises the
whole world dances with joy and everybody's heart is filled with bliss.
If Zen is at all conceivable, it must be taken hold of here.

Therefore, when Bodhidharma (Daruma in J.; Ta-mo in C.) was asked who he
was, he said, "I do not know." This was not because he could not explain
himself, nor was it because he wanted to avoid any verbal controversy,
but just because he did not know what or who he was, save that he was
what he was and could not be anything else. The reason was simple
enough. When Nangaku (Nan-yueh, 677-744) was approaching the Sixth
Patriarch, and was questioned, "What is it that thus walks toward me?"
he did not know what to answer. For eight long years he pondered the
question, when one day it dawned upon him, and he exclaimed, "Even to
say it is something does not hit the mark." This is the same as saying,
"I do not know."

Sekito once asked his disciple, Yakusan (Yueh-shan), "What are you doing
here?" "I am not doing anything," answered the latter. "If so you are
idling your time away." "Is not idling away the time doing something?"
was Yakusan's response. Sekito still pursued him. "You say you are not
doing anything; who then is this one who is doing nothing?" Yakusan's
reply was the same as that of Bodhidharma, "Even the wisest know it
not." There is no agnosticism in it, nor mysticism either, if this is
understood in the sense of mystification. A plain fact is stated here in
plain language. If it does not seem so to the reader, it is because he
has not attained to this state of mind which enabled Bodhidharma or
Sekito to make the statement.

The Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty requested Fu Daishi (Fu-ta-shih,
497-569) to discourse on a Buddhist sutra. The Daishi taking the chair
sat solemnly in it but uttered not a word. The Emperor said, "I asked
you to give a discourse, and why do you not begin to speak?" Shih, one
of the Emperor's attendants, said, "The Daishi has finished
discoursing." What kind of a sermon did this silent Buddhist philosopher
deliver? Later on, a Zen master commenting on the above says, "What an
eloquent sermon it was!" Vimalakirti, the hero of the sutra bearing his
name, had the same way of answering the question, "What is the absolute
doctrine of non-duality?" Someone remarked, "Thundering, indeed, is this
silence of Vimalakirti." Was this keeping the mouth closed really so
deafening? If so, I hold my tongue now, and the whole universe, with all
its hullabaloo and hurlyburly, is at once absorbed in this absolute
silence. But mimicry does not turn a frog into a green leaf. Where there
is no creative originality there is no Zen. I must say: "Too late, too
late! The arrow has gone off the string."

A monk asked Yeno (Hui-neng), the Sixth Patriarch, "Who has inherited
the spirit of the Fifth Patriarch (Hung-jen)?"

Answered Yeno, "One who understands Buddhism."

"Have you then inherited it?"

"No," replied Yeno, "I have not."

"Why have you not?" was naturally the next question of the monk.

"Because I do not understand Buddhism," Yeno reasoned.

How hard, then, and yet how easy it is to understand the truth of Zen!
Hard because to understand it is not to understand it; easy because not
to understand it is to understand it. A master declares that even Buddha
Sakyamuni and Bodhisattva Maitreya do not understand it, where
simple-minded knaves do understand it.

We can now see why Zen shuns abstractions, representations, and figures
of speech. No real value is attached to such words as God, Buddha, the
soul, the Infinite, the One, and suchlike words. They are, after all,
only words and ideas, and as such are not conducive to the real
understanding of Zen. On the contrary, they often falsify and play at
cross purposes. We are thus compelled always to be on our guard. Said a
Zen master, "Cleanse the mouth thoroughly when you utter the word
Buddha." Or, "There is one word I do not like to hear; that is, Buddha."
Or, "Pass quickly on where there is no Buddha, nor stay where he is."
Why are the followers of Zen so antagonistic toward Buddha? Is not
Buddha their Lord? Is he not the highest reality of Buddhism? He cannot
be such a hateful or unclean thing as to be avoided by Zen adherents.
What they do not like is not the Buddha himself, but the odium attached
to the word.

The answers given by Zen masters to the question "Who or what is the
Buddha?" are full of varieties; and why so? One reason at least is that
they thus desire to free our minds from all possible entanglements and
attachments such as words, ideas, desires, etc., which are put up
against us from the outside. Some of the answers are, then, as follows:

"One made of clay and decorated with gold."

"Even the finest artist cannot paint him."

"The one enshrined in the Buddha Hall."

"He is no Buddha."

"Your name is Yecho."

"The dirt-scraper all dried up."

"See the eastern mountains moving over the waves."

"No nonsense here."

"Surrounded by the mountains are we here."

"The bamboo grove at the foot of Chang-lin hill."

"Three pounds of flax."

"The mouth is the gate of woe."

"Lo, the waves are rolling over the plateau."

"See the three-legged donkey go trotting along."

"A reed has grown piercing through the leg."

"Here goes a man with the chest exposed and the legs all naked."

These are culled at random from a few books I am using for the purpose.
When a thorough systematic search is made in the entire body of Zen
literature we get quite a collection of the most strange statements ever
made concerning such a simple question as, "Who is the Buddha?" Some of
the answers given above are altogether irrelevant; they are, indeed, far
from being appropriate so far as we judge them from our ordinary
standard of reasoning. The others seem to be making sport of the
question or of the questioner himself. Can the Zen masters who make such
remarks be considered to be in earnest and really desiring the
enlightenment of their followers? But the point is to have our minds
work in complete union with the state of mind in which the masters
uttered these strange words. When this is done, every one of these
answers appears in an altogether new light and becomes wonderfully
transparent.

Being practical and directly to the point, Zen never wastes time or
words in explanation. Its answers are always curt and pithy; there is
nothing circumlocutory in Zen; the master's words come out spontaneously
and without a moment's delay. A gong is struck and its vibrations
instantly follow. If we are not on the alert we fail to catch them; a
mere winking and we miss the mark forever. They justly compare Zen to
lightning. The rapidity, however, does not constitute Zen; its
naturalness, its freedom from artificialities, its being expressive of
life itself, its originality---these are the essential characteristics
of Zen. Therefore, we have always to be on guard not to be carried away
by outward signs when we really desire to get into the core of Zen. How
difficult and how misleading it would be to try and understand Zen
literally and logically, depending on those statements which have been
given above as answers to the question "What is the Buddha?" Of course,
so far as they are given as answers they are pointers by which we may
know where to look for the presence of the Buddha; but we must remember
that the finger pointing at the moon remains a finger and under no
circumstances can it be changed into the moon itself. Danger always
lurks where the intellect slyly creeps in and takes the index for the
moon itself.

Yet there are philosophers who, taking some of the above utterances in
their literary and logical sense, try to see something of pantheism in
them. For instance, when the master says, "Three pounds of flax," or "A
dirt-scraper," by this is apparently meant, they would insist, to convey
a pantheistic idea. That is to say that those Zen masters consider the
Buddha to be manifesting himself in everything: in the flax, in a piece
of wood, in the running stream, in the towering mountains, or in works
of art. Mahayana Buddhism, especially Zen, seems to indicate something
of the spirit of pantheism, but nothing is in fact farther from Zen than
this representation. The masters from the beginning have foreseen this
dangerous tendency, and that is why they make those apparently
incoherent statements. Their intention is to set the minds of their
disciples or of scholars free from being oppressed by any fixed opinions
or prejudices or so-called logical interpretations. When Tozan
(Tung-shan, a disciple of Ummon) answered, "Three pounds of flax," to
the question, "What is the Buddha?"---which, by the way, is the same
thing as asking, "What is God?"---he did not mean that the flax he might
have been handling at the time was a visible manifestation of Buddha,
that Buddha when seen with an eye of intelligence could be met with in
every object. His answer simply was, "Three pounds of flax." He did not
imply anything metaphysical in this plain matter-of-fact utterance.
These words came out of his inmost consciousness as water flows out of a
spring, or as a bud bursts forth in the sun. There was no premeditation
or philosophy on his part. Therefore, if we want to grasp the meaning of
"Three pounds of flax," we first have to penetrate into the inmost
recess of Tozan's consciousness and not to try to follow up his mouth.
At another time he may give an entirely different answer, which might
directly contradict the one already given. Logicians will naturally be
nonplussed; they may declare him altogether out of mind. But the
students of Zen will say, "It is raining so gently, see how fresh and
green the grass is," and they know well that their answer is in full
accord with Tozan's "Three pounds of flax."

The following will perhaps show further that Zen is not a form of
pantheism, if we understand by this any philosophy that identifies the
visible universe with the highest reality, called God, or Mind, or
otherwise, and states that God cannot exist independent of his
manifestations. In fact, Zen is something more than this. In Zen there
is no place for time-wasting philosophical discussion. But philosophy is
also a manifestation of life-activity, and therefore Zen does not
necessarily shun it. When a philosopher comes to be enlightened, the Zen
master is never loath to meet him on his own ground. The earlier Zen
masters were comparatively tolerant toward the so-called philosophers
and not so impatient as in the case of Rinzai (Lin-chi, died 867) or
Tokusan (Te-shan, 780-865), whose dealings with them were swift and most
direct. What follows is taken from a treatise by
Daiju^[]{#calibre_link-169}[1](#calibre_link-84)^ on some principles of
Zen compiled in the eighth (or ninth) century, when Zen had begun to
flourish in all its brilliance and with all its uniqueness. A monk asked
Daiju:

"Q. Are words the Mind?

"A. No, words are external conditions *(yen* in J.; *yuan* in C.); they
are not the Mind.

"Q. Apart from external conditions, where is the Mind to be sought?

"A. There is no Mind independent of words. \[That is to say, the Mind is
in words, but is not to be identified with them.\]

"Q. If there is no Mind independent of words, what is the Mind?

"A. The Mind is formless and imageless. The truth is, it is neither
independent of nor dependent upon words. It is eternally serene and free
in its activity. Says the Patriarch, 'When you realize that the Mind is
no Mind, you understand the Mind and its workings.'"

Daiju further writes: "That which produces all things is called
Dharma-nature, or Dharmakaya. By the so-called Dharma is meant the Mind
of all beings. When this Mind is stirred up, all things are stirred up.
When the Mind is not stirred up, there is nothing stirring and there is
no name. The confused do not understand that the Dharmakaya, in itself
formless, assumes individual forms according to conditions. The confused
take the green bamboo for Dharmakaya itself, the yellow blooming tree
for Prajna itself. But if the tree were Prajna, Prajna would be
identical with the non-sentient. If the bamboo were Dharmakaya,
Dharmakaya would be identical with a plant. But Dharmakaya exists,
Prajna exists, even when there is no blooming tree, no green bamboo.
Otherwise, when one eats a bamboo-shoot, this would be eating up
Dharmakaya itself. Such views as this are really not worth talking
about."

Those who have only read the foregoing treatment of Zen as illogical, or
of Zen as a higher affirmation, may condude that Zen is something
unapproachable, something far apart from our ordinary everyday life,
something very alluring but very elusive; and we cannot blame them for
so thinking. Zen ought, therefore, to be presented also from its easy,
familiar, and approachable side. Life is the basis of all things; apart
from it nothing can stand. With all our philosophy, with all our grand
and enhancing ideas, we cannot escape life as we live it. Star-gazers
are still walking on the solid earth.

What is Zen, then, when made accessible to everybody? Joshu (Chao-chou)
once asked a new monk:

"Have you ever been here before?"

The monk answered, "Yes, sir, I have."

Thereupon the master said, "Have a cup of tea."

Later on another monk came and he asked him the same question, "Have you
ever been here?"

This time the answer was quite opposite. "I have never been here, sir."

The old master, however, answered just as before, "Have a cup of tea."

Afterwards the Inju (the managing monk of the monntery) asked the
master, "How is it that you *make* the same offering of a cup of tea no
matter what a monk's reply is?"

The old master called out, "O Inju!" who at once replied, "Yes, master."
Whereupon Joshu said, "Have a cup of tea."

Joshu (778--897) was one of the most astute Zen masters during the T'ang
dynasty, and the development of Zen in China owes much to him. He is
said to have travelled even when he was eighty years of age, his object
being to perfect himself in the mastery of Zen. He died in his one
hundred and twentieth year. Whatever utterances he made were like jewels
that sparkled brightly. It was said of him, "His Zen shines upon his
lips." A monk who was still a novice came to him and asked to be
instructed in Zen.

Joshu said, "Have you not had your breakfast yet?"

Replied the monk, "Yes, sir, I have had it already."

"If so, wash your dishes." This remark by the old master opened the
novice's eye to the truth of Zen.

One day he was sweeping the ground when a monk asked him, "You are such
a wise and holy master; tell me how it is that dust ever accumulates in
your yard."

Said the master, "It comes from the outside."

Another time he was asked, "Why does this holy place attract dust?" To
which his reply was, "There, another particle of dust!"

There was a famous stone bridge at Joshu's monastery, which was one of
the sights there. A stranger monk inquired of him, "I have for some time
heard of your famous stone bridge, but I see no such thing here, only a
plank."

Said Joshu, "You see a plank and don't see a stone bridge."

"Where then is the stone bridge?"

"You have just crossed it," was the prompt reply.

At another time when Joshu was asked about this same stone bridge, his
answer was, "Horses pass it, people pass it, everybody passes it."

In these dialogues do we only see trivial talks about ordinary things of
life and nature? Is there nothing spiritual, conducive to the
enlightenment of the religious soul? Is Zen, then, too practical, too
commonplace? Is it too abrupt a descent from the height of
transcendentalism to everyday things? Well, it all depends on how you
look at it. A stick of incense is burning on my desk. Is this a trivial
affair? An earthquake shakes the earth and Mt. Fuji topples over. Is
this a great event? Yes, so long as the conception of space remains. But
are we really living confined within an enclosure called space? Zen
would answer at once: "With the burning of an incense-stick the whole
*triloka* burns. Within Joshu's cup of tea the mermaids are dancing." So
long as one is conscious of space and time, Zen will keep a respectable
distance from you; your holiday is ill-spent, your sleep is disturbed,
and your whole life is a failure.

Read the following dialogue between Yisan (Kuei-shan) and Kyozan
(Yang-than). At the end of his summer's sojourn Kyozan paid a visit to
Yisan, who said, "I have not seen you this whole summer coming up this
way; what have you been doing down there?"

Replied Kyozan, "Down there I have been tilling a piece of ground and
finished sowing millet seeds."

Yisan said, "Then you have not wasted your summer."

It was now Kyozan's turn to ask Yisan as to his doings during the past
summer, and he asked, "How did you pass your summer?"

"One meal a day and a good sleep at night."

This brought out Kyozan's comment, "Then you have not wasted your
summer."

A Confucian scholar writes, "They seek the truth too far away from
themselves, while it is right near them." The same thing may be said of
Zen. We look for its secrets where they are most unlikely to be found,
that is, in verbal abstractions and metaphysical subtleties, whereas the
truth of Zen really lies in the concrete things of our daily life. A
monk asked the master: "It is some time since I came to you to be
instructed in the holy path of the Buddha, but you have never given me
even an inkling of it. I pray you to be more sympathetic." To this the
following answer was given: "What do you mean, my son? Every morning you
salute me, and do I not return it? When you bring me a cup of tea, do I
not accept it and enjoy drinking it? Besides this, what more
instructions do you desire from me?"

Is this Zen? Is this the kind of life-experience Zen wants us to have? A
Zen poet sings:

> How wondrously strange, and how miraculous this!

> I draw water, I carry fuel.

When Zen is said to be illogical and irrational, timid readers are
frightened and may wish to have nothing to do with it, but I am
confident that the present chapter devoted to practical Zen will
mitigate whatever harshness and uncouthness there may have been in it
when it was intellectually treated. In so far as the truth of Zen is on
its practical side and not in its irrationality, we must not put too
much emphasis on its irrationality. This may tend only to make Zen more
inaccessible to ordinary intellects, but in order to show further what a
simple and matter-of-fact business Zen is, and at the same time to
emphasize the practical side of Zen, I will cite some more of the
so-called "cases" in which appeal is made to the most naive experience
one may have in life. Naïve they are, indeed, in the sense of being free
from conceptual demonstration or from intellectual analysis. You see a
stick raised, or you are asked to pass a piece of household furniture,
or are simply addressed by your name. Such as these are the simplest
incidents of life occurring every day and being passed without any
particular notice, and yet Zen is there---the Zen that is supposed to be
so full of irrationalities, or, if you like to put it so, so full of the
highest speculations that are possible to the human understanding. The
following are some more of these instances, simple, direct, and
practical, and yet pregnant with meaning.

Sekkyo (Shih-kung)^[]{#calibre_link-170}[2](#calibre_link-86)^ asked one
of his accomplished monks, "Can you take hold of empty space?"

"Yes, sir," he replied.

"Show me how you do it."

The monk stretched out his arm and clutched at empty space.

Sekkyo said: "Is that the way? But after all you have not got anything."

"What then," asked the monk, "is your way?"

The master straightway took hold of the monk's nose and gave it a hard
pull, which made the latter exclaim: "Oh, oh, how hard you pull at my
nose! You are hurting me terribly!"

"That is the way to have good hold of empty space," said the master.

When Yenkwan (Yen-kuan), one of Ma-tsu's disciples, was asked by a monk
who the real Vairochana Buddha was, he told the monk to pass over a
water-pitcher which was near by. The monk brought it to him as
requested, but Yenkwan now ordered it to be taken back to its former
place. After obediently following the order, the monk again asked the
master who the real Vairochana Buddha was. "The venerable old Buddha is
no more here," was the reply. Concerning this incident another Zen
master comments, "Yes, the venerable old Buddha has long been here."

If these incidents are regarded as not entirely free from intellectual
complications, what would you think of the following case of Chu (Chung,
died 775), the national teacher of Nan-yang, who used to call his
attendant three times a day, saying, "O my attendant, my attendant!" To
this the attendant would respond regularly, "Yes, master." Finally the
master remarked, "I thought I was in the wrong with you, but it is you
that is in the wrong with me." Is this not simple enough?---just calling
one by name? Chu's last comment may not be so very intelligible from an
ordinary logical point of view, but one calling and another responding
is one of the commonest and most practical affairs of life. Zen declares
that the truth is precisely there, so we can see what a matter-of-fact
thing Zen is. There is no mystery in it, the fact is open to all: I hail
you, and you call back; one "hallo!" calls forth another "hallo!" and
this is all there is to it.

Ryosui (Liang-sui) was studying Zen under Mayoku (Ma-ku, a contemporary
of Rinzai), and when Mayoku called out, "O Ryosui!" he answered, "Yes!"
Thus called three times, he answered three times, when the master
remarked, "O you stupid fellow!" This brought Ryosui to his senses; he
now understood Zen and exclaimed: "O master, don't deceive me any more.
If I had not come to you I should have been miserably led astray all my
life by the sutras and the sastras." Later on Ryosui said to some of his
fellow-monks who had been spending their time in the mastery of Buddhist
philosophy, "All that you know, I know; but what I know, none of you
know." Is it not wonderful that Ryosui could make such an utterance just
by understanding the significance of his master's call?

Do these examples make the subject in hand any clearer or more
intelligible than before? I can multiply such instances indefinitely,
but those so far cited may suffice to show that Zen is after all not a
very complicated affair, or a study requiring the highest faculty of
abstraction and speculation. The truth and power of Zen consists in its
very simplicity, directness, and utmost practicalness. "Good morning;
how are you today?" "Thank you, I am well"---here is Zen. "Please have a
cup of tea"---this, again, is full of Zen. When a hungry monk at work
heard the dinner-gong he immediately dropped his work and showed himself
in the dining-room. The master, seeing him, laughed heartily, for the
monk had been acting Zen to its fullest extent. Nothing could be more
natural; the one thing needful is just to open one's eye to the
significance of it all.

But here is a dangerous loophole which the student of Zen ought to be
especially careful to avoid. Zen must never be confused with naturalism
or libertinism, which means to follow one's natural bent without
questioning its origin and value. There is a great difference between
human action and that of the animals, which are lacking in moral
intuition and religious consciousness. The animals do not know anything
about exerting themselves in order to improve their conditions or to
progress in the way to higher virtues. Sekkyo was one day working in the
kitchen when Baso, his Zen teacher, came in and asked what he was doing.
"I am herding the cow," said the pupil. "How do you attend her?" "If she
goes out of the path even once, I pull her back straightway by the nose;
not a moment's delay is allowed." Said the master, "You truly know how
to take care of her." This is not naturalism. Here is an effort to do
the right thing.

A distinguished teacher was once asked, "Do you ever make any effort to
get disciplined in the truth?"

"Yes, I do."

"How do you exercise yourself?"

"When I am hungry I eat; when tired I sleep."

"This is what everybody does; can they be said to be exercising
themselves in the same way as you do?"

"No."

"Why not?"

"Because when they eat they do not eat, but are thinking of various
other things, thereby allowing themselves to be disturbed; when they
sleep they do not sleep, but dream of a thousand and one things. This is
why they are not like myself."

If Zen is to be called a form of naturalism, then it is so with a
rigorous discipline at the back of it. It is in that sense, and not as
it is understood by libertines, that Zen may be designated naturalism.
The libertines have no freedom of will, they are bound hands and feet by
external agencies before which they are utterly helpless. Zen, on the
contrary, enjoys perfect freedom; that is, it is master of itself. Zen
has no "abiding place", to use a favourite expression in the
*Prajnaparamita Sutras*. When a thing has its fixed abode, it is
fettered, it is no more absolute. The following dialogue will very
clearly explain this point.

A monk asked, "Where is the abiding place for the mind?"

"The mind," answered the master, "abides where there is no abiding."

"What is meant by 'there is no abiding'?"

"When the mind is not abiding in any particular object, we say that it
abides where there is no abiding."

"What is meant by not abiding in any particular object?"

"It means not to be abiding in the dualism of good and evil, being and
non-being, thought and matter; it means not to be abiding in emptiness
or in non-emptiness, neither in tranquillity nor in non-tranquillity.
Where there is no abiding place, this is truly the abiding place for the
mind."

Seppo (Hsueh-feng, 822-908) was one of the most earnest truth-seekers in
the history of Zen during the T'ang dynasty. He is said to have carried
a ladle throughout the long years of his disciplinary Zen
peregrinations. His idea was to serve in one of the most despised and
most difficult positions in the monastery life---that is, as cook---and
the ladle was his symbol. When he finally succeeded Tokusan (Teh-shan)
as Zen master a monk approached him and asked: "What is that you have
attained under Tokusan? How serene and self-contained you are!"
"Empty-handed I went away from home, and empty-handed I returned." Is
not this a practical explanation of the doctrine of "no abiding place"?
The monks wanted their master Hyakujo (Pai-chang) to give a lecture on
Zen. He said, "You attend to the farming and later on I will tell you
all about Zen." After they had finished the work the master was
requested to fulfil his promise, whereupon he opened out both his arms,
but said not a word. This was his great sermon.

T[HE]{.small} object of Zen discipline consists in acquiring a new
viewpoint for looking into the essence of things. If you have been in
the habit of thinking logically according to the rules of dualism, rid
yourself of it and you may come around somewhat to the viewpoint of Zen.
You and I are supposedly living in the same world, but who can tell that
the thing we popularly call a stone that is lying before my window is
the same to both of us? You and I sip a cup of tea. That act is
apparently alike to us both, but who can tell what a wide gap there is
subjectively between your drinking and my drinking? In your drinking
there may be no Zen, while mine is brim-full of it. The reason for it
is: you move in a logical circle and I am out of it. Though there is in
fact nothing new in the so-called new viewpoint of Zen, the term "new"
is convenient to express the Zen way of viewing the world, but its use
here is a condescension on the part of Zen.

This acquiring of a new viewpoint in Zen is called *satori (wu* in C.)
and its verb form is *satori*. Without it there is no Zen, for the life
of Zen begins with the "opening of *satori". Satori* may be defined as
intuitive looking-into, in contradistinction to intellectual and logical
understanding. Whatever the definition, *satori* means the unfolding of
a new world hitherto un-perceived in the confusion of a dualistic mind.
With this preliminary remark I wish the reader to ponder the following
*mondo* (literally, "asking and answering"), which I hope will
illustrate my statement.

A young monk asked Joshu to be instructed in the faith of Zen. Said the
master:

"Have you had your breakfast, or not?"

"Yes, master, I have," answered the monk.

"Go and get your bowls washed," was the immediate response. And this
suggestion at once opened the monk's mind to the truth of Zen.

Later on Ummon commented on the response, saying: "Was there any special
instruction in this remark by Joshu, or was there not? If there was,
what was it? If there was not, what *satori* was it which the monk
attained?" Still later Suigan had the following retort on Ummon: "The
great master Ummon does not know what is what; hence this comment of
his. It is altogether unnecessary; it is like painting legs to a snake,
or painting a beard to the eunuch. My view differs from his. That monk
who seems to have attained a sort of *satori* goes to hell as straight
as an arrow!"

What does all this mean---Joshu's remark about washing the bowls, the
monk's attainment of *satori*, Ummon's alternatives, and Suigan's
assurance? Are they speaking against one another, or is it much ado
about nothing? To my mind, they are all pointing one way and the monk
may go anywhere, but his *satori* is not to no purpose.

Tokusan was a great scholar of the *Diamond Sutra*. Learning that there
was such a thing as Zen, ignoring all the written scriptures and
directly laying hands on one's soul, he went to Ryutan to be instructed
in the teaching. One day Tokusan was sitting outside trying to look into
the mystery of Zen. Ryutan said, "Why don't you come in?" Replied
Tokusan, "It is pitch dark." A candle was lighted and held out to
Tokusan. When he was at the point of taking it Ryutan suddenly blew out
the light, whereupon the mind of Tokusan was opened.

Hyakujo (Pai-chang) went out one day attending his master Baso (Ma-tsu),
when they saw a flock of wild geese flying. Baso asked:

"What are they?"

"They are wild geese, sir."

"Whither are they flying?"

"They have flown away."

Baso, abruptly taking hold of Hyakujo's nose, gave it a twist. Overcome
with pain, Hyakujo cried out: "Oh! Oh!"

Said Baso, "You say they have flown away, but all the same they have
been here from the very first."

This made Hyakujo's back wet with perspiration; he had *satori.*

Is there any possible connection between the washing of the bowls and
the blowing out of the candle and the twisting of the nose? We must say
with Urninon: If there is none, how could they have all come to a
realization of the truth of Zen? If there is, what is the inner
relationship? What is this *satori?* What new point of view of looking
at things is this?

Under Daiye (Ta-hui),^[]{#calibre_link-173}[2](#calibre_link-90)^ the
great Zen master of the Sung dynasty, there was a monk named Doken
(Tao-ch'ien), who bad spent many years in the study of Zen, but who had
not as yet uncovered its secrets, if there were any. He was quite
discouraged when he was sent on an errand to a distant city. A trip
requiring half a year to finish would be a hindrance rather than a help
to his study. Sogen (Tsung-yuan), one of his fellow students, was most
sympathetic and said, "I will accompany you on this trip and do all I
can for you; there is no reason why you cannot go on with your
meditation even while travelling." One evening Doken despairingly
implored his friend to assist him in the solution of the mystery of
life. The friend said, "I am willing to help you in every way I can, but
there are some things in which I cannot be of any help to you; these you
must look after for yourself." Doken expressed the desire to know what
these things were. Said his friend: "For instance, when you are hungry
or thirsty, my eating of food or drinking will not fill your stomach;
you must eat and drink for yourself. When you want to respond to the
calls of nature you must take care of yourself, for I cannot be of any
use to you. And then it will be nobody else but yourself that will carry
your body along this highway." This friendly counsel at once opened the
mind of the truth-seeking monk, who was so transported with his
discovery that he did not know how to express his joy. Sogen said that
his work was now done and that his further companionship would have no
meaning after this; so he left Doken to continue his journey all by
himself. After a half year Doken returned to his own monastery. Daiye,
on his way down the mountains, happened to meet Doken and at once made
the following remark, "This time he knows it all." What was it, let me
ask, that flashed through Doken's mind when his Mend Sogen gave him such
matter-of-fact advice?

Kyogen (Hsiang-yen) was a disciple of Hyakujo (Pai-chang). After his
master's death Kyogen went to Yisan (Kuei-shan), who had been a senior
disciple of Hyakujo. Yisan asked him: "I am told that you have been
studying under my late master, and also that you have remarkable
intelligence. The understanding of Zen through this medium necessarily
ends in intellectual analytical comprehension, which is not of much use;
but nevertheless you may have had an insight into the truth of Zen. Let
me have your view as to the reason of birth and death; that is, as to
your own being before your parents had given birth to you."

Thus asked, Kyogen did not know how to reply. He retired into his own
room and assiduously made research into the notes which he had taken of
the sermons given by their late master. He failed to come across a
suitable passage which he might present as his own view. He returned to
Yisan and implored him to teach him in the faith of Zen, but Yisan
replied: "I really have nothing to impart to you, and if I tried to do
so you might have occasion to make me an object of ridicule. Besides,
whatever I can tell you is my own and can never be yours." Kyogen was
disappointed and considered him unkind. Finally he came to the decision
to burn up all his notes and memoranda, which seemed to be of no help to
his spiritual welfare, and, retiring altogether from the world, to spend
the rest of his life in solitude and the simple life in accordance with
Buddhist rules. He reasoned: "What is the use of studying Buddhism,
which is so difficult to comprehend and which is too subtle to receive
as instruction from another? I will be a plain homeless monk, troubled
with no desire to master things too deep for thought." He left Yisan and
built a hut near the tomb of Chu, the National Master at Nan-yang. One
day he was weeding and sweeping the ground when a pebble which he had
swept away struck a bamboo; the unexpected sound produced by the
percussion elevated his mind to a state of *satori*. His joy was
boundless. The question proposed by Yisan became transparent; he felt as
if meeting his lost parents. Besides, he came to realize the kindness of
Yisan in refusing him instruction, for now he realized that this
experience could not have happened to him if Yisan had been unkind
enough to explain things to him.

Cannot Zen be so explained that a master can lead all his pupils to
enlightenment through explanation? Is *satori* something that is not at
all capable of intellectual analysis? Yes, it is an experience which no
amount of explanation or argument can make communicable to others unless
the latter themselves had it previously. If *satori* is amenable to
analysis in the sense that by so doing it becomes perfectly clear to
another who has never had it, that *satori* will be no *satori*. For a
*satori* turned into a concept ceases to be itself; and there will no
more be a Zen experience. Therefore, all that we can do in Zen in the
way of instruction is to indicate, or to suggest, or to show the way so
that one's attention may be directed towards the goal. As to attaining
the goal and taking hold of the thing itself, this must be done by one's
own hands, for nobody else can do it for one. As regards the indication,
it lies everywhere. When a man's mind is matured for *satori* it tumbles
over one everywhere. An inarticulate sound, an unintelligent remark, a
blooming flower, or a trivial incident such as stumbling, is the
condition or occasion that will open his mind to *satori*. Apparently,
an insignificant event produces an effect which in importance is
altogether out of proportion. The light touch of an igniting wire, and
an explosion follows which will shake the very foundation of the earth.
All the causes, all the conditions of *satori* are in the mind; they are
merely waiting for the maturing. When the mind is ready for some reasons
or others, a bird flies, or a bell rings, and you at once return to your
original home; that is, you discover your now real self. From the very
beginning nothing has been kept from you, all that you wished to see has
been there all the time before you, it was only yourself that closed the
eye to the fact. Therefore, there is in Zen nothing to explain, nothing
to teach, that will add to your knowledge. Unless it grows out of
yourself no knowledge is really yours, it is only a borrowed plumage.

Kozankoku (Huang Shan-ku), a Confucian poet and statesman of the Sung,
came to Kwaido (Hui-t'ang) to be initiated into Zen. Said the Zen
master: "There is a passage in the text with which you are perfectly
familiar which fitly describes the teaching of Zen. Did not Confucius
declare: 'Do you think I am hiding things from you, O my disciples?
Indeed, I have nothing to hide from you.'" Kozankoku tried to answer,
but Kwaido immediately checked him by saying, "No, no!" The Confucian
scholar felt troubled in mind but did not know how to express himself.
Some time later they were having a walk in the mountains; the wild
laurel was in full bloom and the air was redolent with its scent. Asked
the Zen master, "Do you smell it?" When the Confucian answered
affirmatively, Kwaido said, "There, I have nothing to hide from you."
This reminder at once led Kozankoku's mind to the opening of a *satori.*

These examples will suffice to show what *satori* is and how it unfolds
itself. The reader may ask, however: "After the perusal of all your
explanations or indications, we are not a whit wiser. Can you not
definitely describe the content of *satori*, if there is any? Your
examples and statements are tentative enough, but we simply know how the
wind blows; where is the port the boat finally makes for?" To this the
Zen devotee may answer: As far as content goes, there is none in either
*satori* or Zen that can be described or presented or demonstrated for
your intellectual appreciation. For Zen has no business with ideas, and
*satori* is a sort of inner perception---not the perception, indeed, of
a single individual object but the perception of Reality itself, so to
speak. The ultimate destination of *satori* is towards the Self; it has
no other end but to be back within oneself. Therefore, said Joshu, "Have
a cup of tea." Therefore, said Nansen, "This is such a good sickle, it
cuts so well." This is the way the Self functions, and it must be
caught, if at all catchable, in the midst of its functioning.

As *satori* strikes at the primary root of existence, its attainment
generally marks a turning point in one's life. The attainment, however,
must be thoroughgoing and clear-cut; a lukewarm *satori*, if there is
such a thing, is worse than no *satori*. See the following examples:

When Rinzai (Lin-chi) was meekly submitting to the thirty blows of Obaku
(Huang-po), he presented a pitiable sight, but as soon as he had
attained *satori* he was quite a different personage. His first
exclamation was, "There is not much after all in the Buddhism of Obaku."
And when he again saw the reproachful Obaku, he returned his favour by
giving him a slap in the face. "What arrogance! What impudence!" one may
think. But there was reason in Rinzai's rudeness; no wonder Obaku was
quite pleased with this treatment.

When Tokusan (Te-shan) gained an insight into the truth of Zen he
immediately took out all his commentaries on the *Diamond Sutra*, once
so valued and considered indispensable that he had to carry them
wherever he went, and set fire to them, reducing all the manuscripts to
ashes. He exclaimed, "However deep one's knowledge of abstruse
philosophy, it is like a piece of hair flying in the vastness of space;
however important one's experience in things worldly, it is like a drop
of water thrown into an unfathomable abyss."

One day, following the incident of the flying geese, to which reference
was made elsewhere, Baso appeared in the preaching hall and was about to
speak before a congregation, when Hyakujo, whose nose was literally put
out of joint, came forward and began to roll up the matting which is
spread before the Buddha for the master to kneel. The rolling up
generally means the end of the sermon. Baso, without protesting, came
down from the pulpit and returned to his room. He sent for Hyakujo and
asked him why he rolled up the matting before he had even uttered a
word. Replied Hyakujo, "Yesterday you twisted my nose and it was quite
painful." Said Baso, "Where were your thoughts wandering?" Hyakujo
replied, "Today it is no longer painful." With this Baso admitted
Hyakujo's understanding.

These examples are sufficient to show what changes are produced in one's
mind by the attainment of *satori*. Before *satori*, how helpless those
monks were! They were like travellers lost in the desert. But after
*satori* they behave like absolute mon-archs; they are no longer slaves
to anybody, they are themselves master.

After these remarks the following points about the opening of the mind
that is called *satori* may be observed and summarized.

1. People often imagine that the discipline of Zen is to produce a state
of self-suggestion through meditation. This entirely misses the mark, as
can be seen from the various instances cited above. *Satori* does not
consist in producing a certain premeditated condition by intensely
thinking of it. It is acquiring a new point of view for looking at
things. Ever since the unfoldment of consciousness we have been led to
respond to the inner and outer conditions in a certain conceptual and
analytical manner. The discipline of Zen consists in upsetting this
groundwork once for all and reconstructing the old frame on an entirely
new basis. It is evident, therefore, that meditating on metaphysical and
symbolical statements, which are products of a relative consciousness,
play no part in Zen.

2\. Without the attainment of *satori* no one can enter into the truth
of Zen. *Satori* is the sudden flashing into consciousness of a new
truth hitherto undreamed of. It is a sort of mental catastrophe taking
place all at once, after much piling up of matters intellectual and
demonstrative. The piling has reached a limit of stability and the whole
edifice has come tumbling to the ground, when, behold, a new heaven is
open to full survey. When the freezing point is reached, water suddenly
turns into ice; the liquid has suddenly turned into a solid body and no
more flows freely. *Satori* comes upon a man unawares, when he feels
that he has exhausted his whole being. Religiously, it is a new birth;
intellectually, it is the acquiring of a new viewpoint. The world now
appears as if dressed in a new garment, which seems to cover up all the
unsightliness of dualism, which is called delusion in Buddhist
phraseology.

3\. *Satori* is the *raison d'être* of Zen without which Zen is no Zen.
Therefore every contrivance, disciplinary or doctrinal, is directed
toward *satori*. Zen masters could not remain patient for *satori* to
come by itself; that is, to come sporadically or at its own pleasure. In
their earnestness to aid their disciples in the search after the truth
of Zen their manifestly enigmatical presentations were designed to
create in their disciples a state of mind which would more
systematically open the way to enlightenment. All the intellectual
demonstrations and exhortatory persuasions so far carried out by most
religious and philosophical leaders had failed to produce the desired
effect, and their disciples thereby had been farther and farther led
astray. Especially was this the case when Buddhism was first introduced
into China, with all its Indian heritage of highly metaphysical
abstractions and most complicated systems of Yoga discipline, which left
the more practical Chinese at a loss as to how to grasp the central
point of the doctrine of Sakyamuni. Bodhidharma, the Sixth Patriarch,
Baso, and other Chinese masters noticed this fact, and the proclamation
and development of Zen was the natural outcome. By them *satori* was
placed above sutra-learning and scholarly discussions of the sastras and
was identified with Zen itself. Zen, therefore, without *satori* is like
pepper without its pungency. But there is also such a thing as too much
attachment to the experience of *satori*, which is to be detested.

4\. This emphasizing of *satori* in Zen makes the fact quite significant
that Zen is not a system of Dhyana as practised in India and by other
Buddhist schools in China. By Dhyana is generally understood a kind of
meditation or contemplation directed toward some fixed thought; in
Hinayana Buddhism it was the thought of transiency, while in the
Mahayana it was more often the doctrine of emptiness. When the mind has
been so trained as to be able to realize a state of perfect void in
which there is not a trace of consciousness left, even the sense of
being unconscious having departed; in other words, when all forms of
mental activity are swept away clean from the field of consciousness,
leaving the mind like the sky devoid of every speck of cloud, a mere
broad expanse of blue, Dhyana is said to have reached its perfection.
This may be called ecstasy or trance, but it is not Zen. In Zen there
must be *satori;* there must be a general mental upheaval which destroys
the old accumulations of intellection and lays down the foundation for a
new life; there must be the awakening of a new sense which will review
the old things from a hitherto undreamed-of angle of observation. In
Dhyana there are none of these things, for it is merely a quieting
exercise of mind. As such Dhyana doubtless has its own merit, but Zen
must not be identified with it.

5.*Satori* is not seeing God as he is, as might be contended by some
Christian mystics. Zen has from the beginning made clear and insisted
upon the main thesis, which is to see into the work of creation; the
creator may be found busy moulding his universe, or he may be absent
from his workshop, but Zen goes on with its own work. It is not
dependent upon the support of a creator; when it grasps the reason for
living a life, it is satisfied. Hoyen (Fa-yen, died 1104) of Go-so-san
used to produce his own hand and ask his disciples why it was called a
hand. When we know the reason, there is *satori* and we have Zen.
Whereas with the God of mysticism there is the grasping of a definite
object; when you have God, what is no-God is excluded. This is
self-limiting. Zen wants absolute freedom, even from God. "No abiding
place" means that very thing; "Cleanse your mouth when you utter the
word Buddha" amounts to the same thing. It is not that Zen wants to be
morbidly unholy and godless, but that it recognizes the incompleteness
of a mere name. Therefore, when Yakusan (Yueh-shan, 751-834) was asked
to give a lecture, he did not say a word, but instead came down from the
pulpit and went off to his own room. Hyakujo merely walked forward a few
steps, stood still, and then opened out his arms, which was his
exposition of the great principle.

6\. *Satori* is not a morbid state of mind, a fit subject for the study
of abnormal psychology. If anything, it is a perfectly normal state of
mind. When I speak of a mental upheaval, some may be led to consider Zen
as something to be shunned by ordinary people. This is a most mistaken
view of Zen, but one unfortunately often held by prejudiced critics. As
Joshu declared, "Zen is your everyday thought"; it all depends on the
adjustment of the hinge whether the door opens in or opens out. Even in
the twinkling of an eye the whole affair is changed and you have Zen,
and you are as perfect and as normal as ever. More than that, you have
acquired in the meantime something altogether new. All your mental
activities will now be working to a different key, which will be more
satisfying, more peaceful, and fuller of joy than anything you ever
experienced before. The tone of life will be altered. There is something
rejuvenating in the possession of Zen. The spring flowers look prettier,
and the mountain stream runs cooler and more transparent. The subjective
revolution that brings about this state of things cannot be called
abnonnal. When life becomes more enjoyable and its expanse broadens to
include the universe itself, there must be something in *satori* that is
quite precious and well worth one's striving after.

Z[EN]{.small} is a unique product of the Oriental mind and its
uniqueness consists, so far as its practical aspect goes, in its
methodical training of the mind in order to mature it to the state of
*satori,* when all its secrets are revealed. Zen may be called a form of
mysticism, but it differs from all other forms of it in system, in
discipline, and in final attainment. By this I mean principally the
*koan* exercise and *zazen.*

*Zazen*, or its Sanskrit equivalent *dhyana,* means sitting cross-legged
in quietude and in deep contemplation. The practice originated in India
and spread all over the East. It has been going on through centuries
now, and the modern followers of Zen still strictly observe it. In this
respect *zazen* is the prevailing practical method of spiritual
discipline in the East, but when it is used in connection with the
*koan* it assumes a special feature and becomes the monopoly of Zen.

To explain fully what *zazen* or Dhyana is is not the object of this
chapter, which is chiefly concerned with the *koan* as the most
essential feature of Zen now practised in the Far East. Originally in
Buddhism, Dhyana was one of its three branches of discipline: *Sila*
(moral precepts), *Dhyana* (contemplation), and *Prajna* (wisdom). Good
Buddhists are supposed to be morally observant of all the precepts laid
down by the Buddha, to be thoroughly versed in the methods for keeping
their inordinate passions well under control, and finally to be
intellectual[]{#calibre_link-176}[^2^](#calibre_link-94) enough to know
all the intricacies of logic in the advancement of Buddhist metaphysics.
When a man lacks in any of these qualifications he cannot be said to be
a very good follower of Sakyamuni. But as time went on differentiation
took place, and some Buddhists came to emphasize one of the three more
strongly than the others. Some were moralists more than anything else,
others were students of Dhyana, and still others were devoted to the
mastery of intellectual subtleties implied in the teachings of Buddhism.
Zen followers may be considered practisers of Dhyana, but in Zen Dhyana
has ceased to be understood in its primitive sense; for Zen has now its
own object in the practice of this particular Indian form of spiritual
exercises.

According to the *Mahayana Sastra* quoted in the *Dhyana-Paramita
Systematically Expounded* by Chi-sha Daishi, the founder of the
T'ien-tai sect, Dhyana is practised in order to fulfil the four great
vows[]{#calibre_link-177}[^3^](#calibre_link-95) cherished by every
pious Buddhist:

> Dhyana is the storage of good wisdom,

> And the farm of blissful merits;

> Like unto water free from impurities,

> Dhyana washes all the dust of passion;

> Dhyana is the armour wrought of vajra,

> Which shields the wearer from the arrows of evil desires;

> Though you may not yet have attained to a state of non-doing,

> You are already gaining towards Nirvana;

> For you will gain the Vajra-samadhi,

> You will break in pieces the Hindrances and Restrictions, though
> mountain-high they are,

> You will attain the Six Miraculous Powers,

> And you will be able to deliver numberless beings;

> When the dust of Annoyance rises so high as to screen the heavenly
> sun,

> Great showers may wash it away,

> The wind of Intellectual Enlightenment may remove it,

> But it is Dhyana that will destroy it altogether.

*Dhyana* comes from the root *dhi,* meaning "to perceive", "to reflect
upon", "to fix the mind upon"; while *dhi* etymologi-cally may have some
connection with *dha,* "to hold", "to keep", "to maintain". Dhyana thus
means to hold one's thought collected, not to let thought wander away
from its legitimate path; that is, it means to have the mind
concentrated on a single subject of thought. Therefore, when Zen or
Dhyana is practised, all the outer details are to be so controlled as to
bring the mind into the most favourable condition in which it will
gradually rise above the turbulence of passions and sensualities. For
instance, eating and drinking have to be properly regulated; sleep is
not to be too much indulged in; the body is to be kept in an easy and
comfortable position, but straight and erect; and as to the control of
breathing, the Indians are, as is well known, consummate artists. Next,
the choice of the place where the Dhyana-practiser is to sit is another
important consideration, and naturally such places as the market, the
factory, or the business office may better be avoided. There are many
more rules or suggestions relating to the control of the body and the
mind, which are fully treated in Chi-sha's work on
*Dhyana-Paramita.[]{#calibre_link-178}[^4^](#calibre_link-96)*

As is evident even from this brief account of Dhyana, *zazen* as is
practised by Zen devotees has not the same object in mind as is the case
with Buddhists generally. In Zen, Dhyana or *zazen* is used as the means
of reaching the solution of the *koan.* Zen does not make Dhyana an end
in itself, for apart from the *koan* exercise, the practising of *zazen*
is a secondary consideration. It is no doubt a necessary accompaniment
to the mastery of Zen; even when the *koan* is understood, its deep
spiritual truth will not be driven home to the mind of the Zen student
if he is not thoroughly trained in *zazen. Koan* and *zazen* are the two
handmaids of Zen; the first is the eye and the second is the foot.

In the early days of Buddhism in China, philosophical discussion first
attracted the attention of the earnest students of Buddhism and such
sutras as the *Avatamsaka, Pundarika, Prajna-paramita, Nirvana,* etc.,
were early translated into Chinese. The deep metaphysical thoughts
contained in these sacred texts interested Chinese scholars more than
did other matters that were also to be found in them, and it was
probably chiefly due to the incomparable Kutnarajiva that a great
impetus was given to the Chinese Buddhists to the intellectual mastery
of the texts. The ethical study of Buddhism came next. When
Bodhi-dharma, the First Patriarch of Zen, came to China in the sixth
century, he was looked upon somewhat askance as a sort of heretic.
Scholars of Buddhist philosophy did not understand him and disliked him.
Even when Yeno (Hui-neng), the Sixth Patriarch, came out of obscurity
and self-concealment to announce himself as the rightful transmitter of
Zen, he was not very much noticed by the other practisers of Dhyana. So
far Dhyana or *zazen* had been practised chiefly after the Hinayana
fashion, as we read in the biographical writings of earlier Buddhism in
China, and also as we can infer from the sutras on Dhyana which were
translated down to those days. It was a generation or two after Yeno
that Zen, as we understand it now, really came into existence, which
thereafter rapidly developed so as to overshadow all the other Buddhist
schools. At present there are no Buddhist monasteries in China which do
not belong to the Zen sect, and most of them are of the Rinzai school of
Zen.[]{#calibre_link-179}[^5^](#calibre_link-97) One reason among others
for this conquest is to be found in the practice of *zazen* as the means
of mastering the *koan* and thus attaining *satori.*

*Ko-an* literally means "a public document" or "authoritative
statute"---a term coming into vogue toward the end of the T'ang dynasty.
It now denotes some anecdote of an ancient master, or a dialogue between
a master and monks, or a statement or question put forward by a teacher,
all of which are used as the means for opening one's mind to the truth
of Zen. In the beginning, of course, there was no *koan* as we
understand it now; it is a kind of artificial instrument devised out of
the fullness of heart by later Zen masters, who by this means would
force the evolution of Zen consciousness in the minds of their less
endowed disciples.

The mind may grow by itself even when it is left to nature to achieve
her own ends, but man cannot always wait for her, he likes to meddle for
better or worse. He is never patient; whenever there is a chance to put
his fingers in, he is sure to do so. The interference is sometimes
helpful, sometimes decidedly not. As a rule it works two ways. We
welcome human interference when more is to be gained than lost and call
it improvement and progress; but when it turns out otherwise we call it
retrogression. Civilization is human and artificial; some are not
satisfied with it and want to go back to nature. Well, so-called modern
progress is by no means unmitigated bliss, but on the whole, at least on
the material side of life, we seem to be better off these days than ever
before, and we see some signs of further improvement. Therefore, our
grumblings generally are not very vehemently asserted.

In a similar way, the introduction of the system of *koan* into Zen,
pure, natural, and elementary, is at once a deterioration and an
improvement. But once brought out into existence, the system seems very
hard to do away with. It was, of course, quite human on the part of the
Zen master to be thinking of his less fortunate brothers whose natural
endowments were not so rich as his own, and who, therefore, would be
likely to miss opportunities to come into the truth of Zen. He wanted to
impart to them, if possible, the same wonderful bliss of the
understanding which he had gained through the mastery of Zen. His
motherly instinct made him think of some way to open or even to coerce
the minds of his disciples to the unknown beauties of *satori,* which,
when left to their own ignorant ways, would never come upon them except
by a happy rare chance. The master knew that the device of a *koan* was
an artificiality and a superfluity; for unless Zen grew out of a man's
own inner activity it could not be truly genuine and full of creative
vitality as it ought to be. But even a semblance would be a blessing
when the genuine thing is so difficult and rare to have; and, moreover,
it was likely, if It is left to itself; to disappear altogether out of
the lore of human experience. The semblance is not necessarily a mere
makeshift but may have in it something quite true and full of
possibilities; for the system of *koan* and *zazen,* when properly made
use of, really does unfold the mind to the truth of Zen. Why then should
we not adopt it and work it out to its fullness?

At the beginning, a Zen master was a kind of self-made man; he had no
school education, he had not been sent to college to pass through a
certain course of studies, but out of an inner impelling necessity which
stirred up his spirit he could not help going about and picking up
whatever knowledge he needed. He was perfected by himself. Of course, he
had a teacher, but the teacher did not help him in the way scholars
nowadays are helped---helped too frequently, indeed, beyond the actual
needs of the disciple, more than is really good for him. This lack of
soft education made the ancient Zen master all the stronger and more
full of virility. This was the reason why, in those early days of
Zen---that is, during the T'ang dynasty---it was so active, so
brilliant, so intense. When the *koan* system came into vogue during the
Sung dynasty the halcyon days of Zen were almost over and it gradually
showed signs of decline and senility.

Here then is one of the first *koans* given to latter-day students. When
the Sixth Patriarch was asked by the monk Myo (Ming) what Zen was, he
said: "When your mind is not dwelling on the dualism of good and evil,
what is your original face before you were born?" (Show me this "face"
and you get into the mystery of Zen. Who are you before Abraham was
born? When you have had a personal, intimate interview with this
personage, you will better know who you are and who God is. The monk is
here told to shake hands with this original man, or, if metaphysically
put, with his own inner self.)

When this question was put to the monk Myo, he was already mentally
ready to see into the truth of it. The questioning is merely on the
surface, it is really an affirmation meant to open the mind of the
listener. The Patriarch noticed that Myo's mind was on the verge of
unfolding itself to the truth of Zen. The monk had been groping in the
dark long and earnestly; his mind had become mature, so mature indeed
that it was like a ripe fruit which required only a slight shaking to
cause it to drop on the ground; his mind required only a final touch by
the hand of the master. The demand for "the original face" was the last
finish necessary, and Myo's mind instantly opened and grasped the truth.
But when this statement in the form of a question about "the original
face" is given to a novice, who has had no previous discipline in Zen as
Myo had, it is usually given with the intention to awaken the student's
mind to the fact that what he has so far accepted as a commonplace fact,
or as a logical impossibility, is not necessarily so, and that his
former way of looking at things was not always correct or helpful to his
spiritual welfare. After this is realized, the student might dwell on
the statement itself and endeavour to get at its truth if it has any. To
force the student to assume this inquiring attitude is the aim of the
*koan.* The student must then go on with his inquiring attitude until he
comes to the edge of a mental precipice, as it were, where there are no
other alternatives but to leap over. This giving up of his last hold on
life will bring the student to a full view of "his original face", as
desired by the statement of the Sixth Patriarch. Thus it can be seen
that the *koan* is not handled now in precisely the same way that it was
in those earlier days. As first proposed, it was the culmination, so to
speak, of all that had been working in the mind of the monk Myo, whose
elaboration herein received its final finish; instead of coming at the
beginning of the Zen exercise, as it does now, the Sixth Patriarch's
question came at the end of the race. But in modern days the *koan* is
used as a starter; it gives an initial movement to the racing for Zen
experience. More or less mechanical in the beginning, the movement
acquires the tone needed for the maturing of Zen consciousness; the
*koan* works as a leaven. When the sufficient conditions obtain, the
mind unfolds itself into the full bloom of a *satori.* To use a *koan*
thus instrumentally for the opening of the mind to its own secrets is
characteristic of modern Zen.

Hakuin used to produce one of his hands and demand of his disciples to
hear the sound of it. Ordinarily a sound is heard only when two hands
are clapped, and in that sense no possible sound can come from one hand
alone. Hakuin wants, however, to strike at the root of our everyday
experience, which is constructed on a so-called scientific or logical
basis. This fundamental overthrowing is necessary in order to build up a
new order of things on the basis of Zen experience. Hence this
apparently most unnatural and therefore illogical demand macic by Hakuin
on his pupils. The former *koan* was about "the face", something to look
at, while the latter is about "the sound", something that appeals to the
sense of hearing; but the ultimate purport of both is the same; both are
meant to open up the secret chamber of the mind, where the devotees can
find numberless treasures stored. The sense of seeing or hearing has
nothing to do with the essential meaning of the *koan;* as the Zen
masters say, the *koan* is only a piece of brick used to knock at the
gate, an index-finger pointing at the moon. It is only intended to
synthesize or transcend---whichever expression you may choose---the
dualism of the senses. So long as the mind is not free to perceive a
sound produced by one hand, it is limited and is divided against itself.
Instead of grasping the key to the secrets of creation, the mind is
hopelessly buried in the relativity of things, and, therefore, in their
superficiality. Until the mind is free from the fetters, the time never
comes for it to view the whole world with any amount of satisfaction.
The sound of one hand as a matter of fact reaches the highest heaven as
well as the lowest hell, just as one's original face looks over the
entire field of creation even to the end of time. Hakuin and the Sixth
Patriarch stand on the same platform with their hands mutually joined.

To mention another instance. When Joshu was asked about the significance
of Bodhidharma's coming east (which, proverbially, is the same as asking
about the fundamental principle of Buddhism), he replied, "The
cypress-tree in the courtyard."

"You are talking," said the monk, "of an objective symbol."

"No, I am not talking of an objective symbol."

"Then," asked the monk again, "what is the ultimate principle of
Buddhism?"

"The cypress tree in the courtyard," again replied Joshu.

This is also given to a beginner as a *koan.*

Abstractly speaking, these *koans* cannot be said to be altogether
nonsensical even from a common-sense point of view, and if we want to
reason about them there is perhaps room enough to do so. For instance,
some may regard Hakuin's one hand as symbolizing the universe or the
unconditioned, and Joshu's cypress-tree as a concrete manifestation of
the highest principle, through which the pantheistic tendency of
Buddhism may be recognized. But to understand the *koan* thus
intellectually is not Zen, nor is such metaphysical symbolism at all
present here. Under no circumstances ought Zen to be confounded with
philosophy; Zen has its own reason for standing for itself, and this
fact must never be lost sight of; otherwise, the entire structure of Zen
falls to pieces. The "cypress-tree" is forever a cypress-tree and has
nothing to do with pantheism or any other "ism". Joshu was not a
philosopher even in its broadest and most popular sense; he was a Zen
master through and through, and all that comes forth from his lips is an
utterance directly ensuing from his spiritual experience. Therefore,
apart from this much of "subjectivism", though really there are no such
dualities in Zen as subject and object, thought and the world, the
"cypress-tree" utterly loses its significance. If it is an intellectual
or conceptual statement, we may endeavour to understand its meaning
through the ratiocinative chain of ideas as contained in it, and we may
come to imagine that we have finally solved the difficulty; but Zen
masters will assure you that even then Zen is yet three thousand miles
away from you, and the spirit of Joshu will be heard laughing at you
from behind the screen, which after all you had failed to remove. The
*koan* is intended to be nourished in those recesses of the mind where
no logical analysis can ever reach. When the mind matures so that it
becomes attuned to a similar frame to that of Joshu, the meaning of the
"cypress-tree" will reveal itself; and without further questioning you
will be convinced that you now know it all.

A disciple of Joshu called Kaku-tetsu-shi (Chueh T'ieh-tzu) was asked
after the death of his master whether he had really made the statement
about the cypress-tree in response to the question, "What is the
fundamental principle of Buddhism?" The disciple unhesitatingly
declared, "My master never made that statement." This was a direct
contradiction of the fact; for everybody then knew that Joshu had made
it, and the one who asked Kaku-tetsu-shi about it was himself not
ignorant of it. His questioning was to see what insight this disciple of
Joshu had into the meaning of the story of the cypress-tree. Therefore,
the questioner further pursued Tetsu by saying, "But this is asserted by
everybody, and how can you deny it?" Tetsu insisted, "My master never
said it; and you will do well if you do not thus disparage him." What an
audacious statement! But those that know Zen know that this flat denial
is the irrevocable proof that Tetsu thoroughly understood the spirit of
his master. His Zen was beyond question. But from our common-sense point
of view no amount of intellectual resourcefulness can be brought upon
his flat denial so that it can somehow be reconciled with the plain fact
itself. Zen is, therefore, quite merciless toward those critics who take
the story of the cypress-tree for an expression savouring of Mahayana
pantheism.

The *koans,* therefore, as we have seen, are generally such as to shut
up all possible avenues to rationalization. After a few presentations of
your views in the interview with the master, which is technically called
*san-zen,* you are sure to come to the end of your resources, and this
coming to a *cul-de-sac* is really the true starting point in the study
of Zen. No one can enter into Zen without this experience. When this
point is reached the *koans* may be regarded as having accomplished a
half of the object for which they stand.

To speak conventionally---and I think it is easier for the general
reader to see Zen thus presented---there are unknown recesses in our
minds which lie beyond the threshold of the relatively constructed
consciousness. To designate them as "sub-consciousness" or
"supra-consciousness" is not correct. The word "beyond" is used simply
because it is a most convenient term to indicate their whereabouts. But
as a matter of fact there is no "beyond", no "underneath", no "upon" in
our consciousness. The mind is one indivisible whole and cannot be torn
in pieces. The so-called *terra incognita* is the concession of Zen to
our ordinary way of talking, because whatever field of consciousness
that is known to us is generally filled with conceptual riffraff, and to
get rid of them, which is absolutely necessary for maturing Zen
experience, the Zen psychologist sometimes points to the presence of
some inaccessible region in our minds. Though in actuality there is no
such region apart from our everyday consciousness, we talk of it as
generally more easily comprehensible by us. When the *koan* breaks down
all the hindrances to the ultimate truth, we all realize that there are,
after all, no such things as "hidden recesses of mind" or even the truth
of Zen appearing all the time so mysterious.

The *koan* is neither a riddle nor a witty remark. It has a most
definite objective, the arousing of doubt and pushing it to its furthest
limits. A statement built upon a logical basis is approachable through
its rationality; whatever doubt or difficulty we may have had about it
dissolves itself by pursuing the natural current of ideas. All rivers
are sure to pour into the ocean; but the *koan* is an iron wall standing
in the way and threatening to overcome one's every intellectual effort
to pass. When Joshu says "the cypress-tree in the courtyard", or when
Hakuin puts out his one hand, there is no logical way to get around it.
You feel as if your march of thought had been suddenly cut short. You
hesitate, you doubt, you are troubled and agitated, not knowing how to
break through the wall which seems altogether impassable. When this
climax is reached, your whole personality, your inmost will, your
deepest nature, determined to bring the situation to an issue, throws
itself with no thought of self or no-self, of this or that, directly and
unreservedly against the iron wall of the *koan.* This throwing your
entire being against the *koan* unexpectedly opens up a hitherto unknown
region of the mind. Intellectually, this is the transcending of the
limits of logical dualism, but at the same time it is a regeneration,
the awakening of an inner sense which enables one to look into the
actual working of things. For the first time the meaning of the *koan*
becomes clear, and in the same way that one knows that ice is cold and
freezing. The eye sees, the ear hears, to be sure, but it is the mind as
a whole that has *satori;* it is an act of perception, no doubt, but it
is a perception of the highest order. Here lies the value of the Zen
discipline, as it gives birth to the unshakable conviction that there is
something indeed going beyond mere intellection.

The wall of *koan* once broken through and the intellectual obstructions
well cleared off, you come back, so to speak, to your everyday
relatively constructed consciousness. The one hand does not give out a
sound until it is clapped by the other. The cypress-tree stands straight
before the window; all human beings have the nose vertically set and the
eyes horizontally arranged. Zen is now the most ordinary thing in the
world. A field that we formerly supposed to lie far beyond is now found
to be the very field in which we walk, day in, day out. When we come out
of *satori* we see the familiar world with all its multitudinous objects
and ideas together with their logicalness, and pronounce them "good".

When there was as yet no system of *koan,* Zen was more natural and
purer perhaps, but it was only the few elect who could get into the
spirit of it. Supposing you had lived in those days, what would you do
if you were roughly shaken by the shoulder? How would you take it if you
were called a dry dirt-scraper? Or if you were simply requested to hand
the cushion over there, and, when you had handed it to the master, to be
struck with it? If you had a determination to fathom the depths of Zen
as strong as steel, and a faith in the "reasonableness" of Zen which was
as firm as the earth, you, after many years of meditation, might succeed
in mastering Zen; but such examples are rare in our modern days; we are
so distracted with all kinds of business that we are unable to walk all
by ourselves into the labyrinthine passageway of Zen. In the early days
of the T'ang dynasty people were more simple-hearted and believing,
their minds were not crammed with intellectual biases. But this state of
affairs could not, in the nature of things, last very long; to maintain
the vitality of Zen it was necessary to find some device whereby Zen
could be made more approachable and to that extent more popular; the
*koan* exercise had to be established for the benefit of the rising
generations and also for the coming ones. Though it is in the being of
Zen that it can never be a popular religion in the sense that Shin
Buddhism or Christianity is, yet the fact that it has kept up its line
of transmission unbroken for so many centuries is, in my view,
principally due to the system of *koan.* In China, where Zen originated,
it no longer exists in its pure form; the line of transmission is no
more, so transfused is it with the Pure Land practice of invoking the
Buddha-name. It is only in Japan that Zen is still virile and still
finds its orthodox exponents; and there is every reason to believe that
this is due to the system of reviewing the *koans* in connection with
the practice *of zazen.* There is no doubt that this system is largely
artificial and harbours grave pitfalls, but the life of Zen runs through
it when it is properly handled. To those who pursue it judiciously under
a really competent master, Zen-experience is possible and a state of
*satori* will surely come.

Thus we can see that this Zen-experience is something realizable by
going through a certain process of training. That is, the *koan*
exercise is a system definitely set up with a definite object in view.
Zen is not like other forms of mysticism, entirely left to the sporadic
nature or capriciousness of luck for its experience. The systematization
of *koan* is, therefore, the one thing that is most characteristic of
Zen. It is this that saves Zen from sinking into trance, from becoming
absorbed in mere contemplation, from turning into an exercise in
tranquilliza-tion. Zen attempts to take hold of life in its act of
living; to stop the flow of life and to look into it is not the business
of Zen. The constant presence of the *koan* before our mental vision
keeps the mind always occupied; that is, in full activity. *Satori* is
attained in the midst of this activity and not by suppressing it, as
some may imagine. How much Zen differs from "meditation" as the latter
is generally understood, and practised, we now can see better from what
has been said above as regards the nature of the *koan.*

The systematizing of Zen began as early as the Five Dynasties in
China---that is, in the tenth century---but its completion was due to
the genius of Hakuin (1683--1768) who lived in the Tokugawa era.
Whatever one may say against the abuses of the *koan,* it was the *koan*
that saved Japanese Zen from total annihilation. Consider how Chinese
Zen is faring these days; so far as we can gather it is more or less a
mere name; and again notice the general tendency shown in the practice
of Zen by adherents of the Soto school in present-day Japan. We cannot
deny that there are many good points in Soto, which ought to be
carefully studied, but as to the living of Zen there is perhaps greater
activity in the Rinzai, which employs the *koan* system.

One may say: "If Zen is really so far beyond the intellectual ken as you
claim it to be, there ought not to be any system in it; in fact, there
could not be any, for the very conception of a system is intellectual.
To be thoroughly consistent, Zen should remain a simple absolute
experience excluding all that savours of process or system or
discipline. The *koan* must be an excrescence, a superfluity, indeed a
contradiction." Theoretically, or rather from the absolute point of
view, this is quite correct; therefore, when Zen is asserted
"straightforwardly" it recognizes no *koan* and knows of no round-about
way of proclaiming itself. Just a stick, a fan, or a word! Even when you
say, "It is a stick," or "I hear a sound," or "I see the fist," Zen is
no more there. It is like a flash of lightning, there is no room, no
time, in Zen even for a thought to be conceived. We speak of a *koan* or
a system only when we come to the practical or conventional side of it.
As has been said before, it is really a condescension, an apology, a
compromise, that this present work has been written; much more the whole
systematization of Zen.

To outsiders this "systematization" appears to be no systematization,
for it is full of contradictions, and even among the Zen masters
themselves there is a great deal of discrepancy, which is quite
disconcerting. What one asserts another flatly denies or makes a
sarcastic remark about it, so that the uninitiated are at a loss what to
make out of all these everlasting and hopeless entanglements. But the
fact is that Zen really ought not to be considered from its surface;
such terms as system, rationality, consistency, contradiction, or
discordance belong to the surface of Zen; to understand Zen we are to
turn up the whole piece of brocade and examine it from the other side,
where we can trace at a glance all the intricacies of woof and warp.
This reversing of the order is very much needed in Zen.

Let us quote an example to see how it is treated by different masters.
Funyo, a great Zen master of the T'ang dynasty, said, "If a man knows
what this staff is, his study of Zen comes to a close." This seems to be
a simple enough *koan.* The master generally carries a long staff which
is now a kind of insignia of his religious authority, but in ancient
days it was really a travelling stick that was useful in climbing
mountains or fording streams. Being one of the most familiar objects, it
is produced any time by a master before his congregation to illustrate a
sermon; it is often the subject of a great discussion among the monks.
Cho of Rokutan, another Zen master, apparently opposed the view of the
preceding master, Funyo, when he declared, "If a man knows what the
staff is, he will go to hell as straight as an arrow flies." If this is
the case, no one will be induced to study Zen; but what does Cho really
mean? Ho-an, still another Zen master, makes a statement about this
staff, which is not radical; he is quite rational and innocent when he
says, "If a man knows what the staff is, let him take it and put it up
against the wall over there." Are these masters all asserting the same
fact and pointing to the same truth? Or are they not only in words but
in fact and truth contradicting one another? Let us examine more masters
concerning the staff.

Suiryu one day ascended the pulpit and bringing forth his staff made
this confession: "My twenty years' residence in this monastery is due to
the virtue of this."

A monk stepped forward and asked, "What virtue did you gain out of
that?"

"Supporting myself with this, I cross the streams, I pass over the
mountains; indeed, without it, what can I do?"

Later Shokei, another master, hearing of this remark, said, "If I were
he, I would not say that."

"What would you say?" came quickly from the monk.

Shokei now took the staff, came down to the ground, and walked away.

Ho-an now makes the observation about these two masters: "Suiryu's staff
was a pretty good one, but what a pity! It has a dragon's head with a
snake's tail. It makes Shokei follow him up, and the result is another
pity: his was like putting speckles on a painted tiger. When the monk
asked what power of the staff he had got, why did he not take it out and
throw it away before the congregation? Then there would have been a real
dragon, a real tiger, calling forth clouds and mists."

Now let me ask, why all this---shall we say---much ado about nothing? If
modern Zen is a system, what kind of a system is it? It seems chaotic,
and how conflicting are the masters' views! Yet from the Zen point of
view there is one current running through all these confusions, and each
master is supporting the others in a most emphatic manner. An apparent
contradiction in no way hinders the real endorsement. In thus mutually
complementing each other, not indeed logically but in a fashion
characteristically Zen, we find the life and truth of the *koan.* A dead
statement cannot be so productive of results. Hakuin's "one hand",
Joshu's "cypress-tree", or the Sixth Patriarch's "original
face",[]{#calibre_link-180}[^6^](#calibre_link-98) are all alive to the
very core. Once touch the heart of it and the whole universe will rise
from its grave where we have buried it with our logic and analysis.

For the benefit of students who wish to know more about the *koans*
which are given to Zen students for solution, a few of them are given
here. When Kyosan received a mirror from Yisan, he brought it out before
an assemblage of monks and said: "O monks, Yisan has sent here a mirror;
shall it be called Yisan's or mine? If you call it mine, how is it that
it comes from Yisan? If you call it Yisan's, how do you account for its
being in my hands? If you can make a statement that hits the mark, the
mirror will be retained; if you cannot, it will be broken in pieces."
This he declared three times and as nobody came forward to make a
statement the mirror was destroyed.

Tozan came to Ummon for instruction; the latter asked:

"Where do you come from?"

"From Sato."

"Where have you spent the summer?"

"At Hoji of Konan."

"When did you leave there?"

"On the twenty-fifth of the eighth month."

Ummon suddenly raised his voice and said: "I spare you thirty blows. You
may now retire."

In the evening Tozan went to Ummon's room and asked what his fault was,
so grave as to deserve thirty blows. Said the master, "Is this the way
you wander all over the country? O you rice-bag!"

Yisan was having a nap, when Kyosan came in. Hearing the visitor, Yisan
turned about toward the wall.

Said Kyosan, "I am your disciple; no formality is needed."

The master made a movement as if he were awakening from sleep; Kyosan
started to leave the room, but the master called him back. Said Yisan,
"I am going to tell you about my dream."

Kyosan leaned forward as if listening.

Yisan said, "You guess."

Kyosan went out and brought a basin filled with water and a towel. With
the water the master washed his face, but before he had resumed his seat
another monk, Kyogen, came in. The master said, "We have been performing
a miracle---and not a trivial one at that."

Kyogen replied, "I have been below and know all that has been going on
between you."

"If so, tell me how it is," demanded the master.

Kyogen then brought him a cup of tea.

Yisan remarked: "O you two monks, what intelligent fellows you are! Your
wisdom and miraculous deeds indeed surpass those of Sariputra and
Maudgalyayana!"

Sekiso (Shih-shuang) died and his followers thought that the head monk
ought to succeed him. But Kyuho (Chin-feng), who had been an attendant
to the late master, said: "Wait, I have a question, and the successor
ought to be able to answer it. The old master used to teach us thus:
'Stop all your hankerings; be like cold ashes and withered plants; keep
the mouth tightly closed until mould grows about it; be like pure white
linen, thoroughly immaculate; be as cold and dead as a censer in a
deserted shrine.' How is this to be understood?"

"This," said the head monk, "illustrates a state of absolute
annihilation."

"There, you utterly fail to grasp the meaning."

"Do I? If so, have an incense-stick lighted; if I do not really
understand the old master, I shall not be able to enter into a trance
before the stick burns up."

So saying, the head monk fell into a state of unconsciousness from which
he never arose. Stroking the back of his departed fellow-monk, Kyuho
said, "As to getting into a trance you have shown a splendid example,
but as to understanding the old master you have just the same
significantly failed." This well illustrates the fact that Zen is
entirely different from being absorbed in nothingness.

The number of *koans* is traditionally estimated at 1,700, which,
however, is a very generous way of counting them. For all practical
purposes, less than ten, or even less than five, or just one may be
sufficient to open one's mind to the ultimate truth of Zen. A
thoroughgoing enlightenment, however, is attained only through the most
self-sacrificing application of the mind, supported by an inflexible
faith in the finality of Zen. It is not to be attained by merely
climbing up the gradation of the *koans* one after another, as is
usually practised by followers of the Rinzai school. The number really
has nothing to do with it; the necessary requirements are faith and
personal effort, without which Zen is a mere bubble. Those who regard
Zen as speculation and abstraction will never obtain the depths of it,
which can be sounded only through the highest will-power. There may be
hundreds of *koans,* or there may be an infinite number of them as there
are infinite numbers of objects filling up the universe, but it does not
necessarily concern us. Only let one gain an all-viewing and entirely
satisfying insight into the living actuality of things and the *koans*
will take care of themselves.

This is where lurks the danger of the *koan* system. One is apt to
consider it as everything in the study of Zen, forgetting the true
object of Zen, which is the unfolding of a man's inner life. There are
many who have fallen into this pitfall and the inevitable result has
been the corruption and decay of Zen. Daiye (Ta-hui) was quite
apprehensive of this when he burned up the book on one hundred *koans*
which was compiled by his master Yengo (Yuan-wu). These one hundred
*koans* were selected from Zen literature by Seccho (Hsueh-ton), who
commented on them with verses, one to each. Daiye was a true follower of
Zen. He knew well the object which his master had in view when he made
remarks upon these selections; he knew very well also that they would
subsequently prove a self-murdering weapon against Zen; so he committed
them all to the flames.

The book, however, has survived the fire and is still in our possession
as one of the most important treatises on Zen; indeed, it is a standard
text and authority, to which appeal is still made to settle points of
doubt in the study of Zen. The work is known in Japanese as *Hekigan-shu
(Pi-yen Chi).* To outsiders it is a sealed book; in the first place the
Chinese is not after the classical model but is filled with
colloquialisms of the T'ang and Sung period, which can now be traced
only in Zen literature, while it is most vigorously written. Secondly,
the style is peculiar to this kind of work, and its thoughts and
expressions seem to be so unexpected as to stagger the reader who
expects to find in it ordinary Buddhist nomenclature or at least tame
classicalism. Besides these literary difficulties, the *Hekigan* is
naturally full of Zen. However, those who want to know how *koans* are
handled by Zen followers will do well to consult the book.

There are some other books dealing with the *koans* which are more or
less after the style of the *Hekigan;* such are the *Shoyoroku,*
*Mumonkwan, Kwaiankokugo,* etc. In fact, all the Zen writings known as
*Goroku (Wu-lu,* "sayings and dialogues") as well as the biographical
histories of Zen masters, of which we have a large list, treat the
*koans* in the way peculiar to Zen. Almost every master of note has left
his *Goroku,* which largely constitute what is known as Zen literature.
Where the philosophical study of Buddhism abounds with all sorts of
annotations and exegeses and analyses which are often very detailed and
complicated, Zen offers pithy remarks, epigrammatic suggestions, and
ironical comments, which conspicuously contrast with the former. Another
characteristic of Zen literature is its partiality to poetry: the
*koans* are poetically appreciated or criticized. Of this the
*Hekigan-shu (Pi-yen Chi)* or *Shoyo-roku (T'sung-yung Lu)* are most
significant examples. The first is by Seccho, as was already mentioned,
and the latter is by Wanshi (Hung-chih), who also poetically comments on
a different collection of *koans.* Zen naturally finds its readiest
expression in poetry rather than in philosophy because it has more
affinity with feeling than with intellect; its poetic predilection is
inevitable.

THE Meditation Hall *(zendo)* is where Zen educates its monks. To see
how it is regulated is to get a glimpse into the practical and
disciplinary aspect of Zen. It is a unique institution and most of the
main monasteries in Japan of the Zen sect are provided with it. In the
life of the Zen monks in the Meditation Hall we are reminded of the life
of the Sangha in India.

The system was founded by the Chinese Zen master, Hyakujo (Pai-chang,
720--814), more than one thousand years ago. He left a famous saying
which had been the guiding principle of his life, "A day of no work is a
day of no eating," which is to say, "No eating without
working."[]{#calibre_link-183}[^2^](#calibre_link-102) When he was
thought by his devoted disciples to be too old to work in the garden,
which had been his favourite occupation, they hid all his garden tools,
as he would not listen to their repeated remonstrances. He then refused
to eat. "No work, no living." At all the Meditation Halls work,
especially that which is commonly regarded as menial, is the vital
element in the life of the monk. It thus implies a great deal of manual
labour, such as sweeping, cleaning, cooking, fuel-gathering, tilling the
farm, or going about begging in the villages far and near. No work is
considered to be beneath their dignity, and a perfect feeling of
brotherhood prevails among them. They believe in the sanctity of manual
work; no matter how hard or how mean the work may be, they will not shun
it, and they keep themselves in every way they can; for they are no
idlers, as some of the so-called monks or mendicants are, as for
instance in India.

Psychologically considered, this is splendid; for muscular activity is
the best remedy for the dullness of mind which may grow out of the
meditative habit, and Zen is very apt to produce this undesirable
effect. The trouble with most religious recluses is that their mind and
body do not act in unison; their body is always separated from their
mind, and the latter from the former; they imagine that there is the
body and there is the mind and forget that this separation is merely
ideational, and therefore artificial. The aim of the Zen discipline
being to annul this most fundamental discrimination, it is always
careful to avoid any practice which tends to emphasize the idea of
onesidedness. *Satori* in truth consists in reaching the point where all
our discriminatory notions are done away with, though this is by no
means a state of emptiness. The sluggishness of mind which is so
frequently the product of quietistic meditation, we can thus see, is not
at all conducive to the maturing of *satori*, and those who want to
advance in the study of Zen have naturally to be always on guard in this
respect lest it should finally altogether stop the fluidity, as it were,
of mental activity. This is at least one reason why Zen followers object
to the mere practice of Dhyana. The body kept busy will also keep the
mind busy, and therefore fresh, wholesome, and alert.

Morally, any work involving an expenditure of physical force testifies
to the soundness of ideas. Especially in Zen is this true; abstract
ideas that do not reflect themselves forcibly and efficiently in
practical living are regarded as of no value. Conviction must be gained
through experience and not through abstraction. Moral assertion ought
everywhere to be over and above intellectual judgment; that is, truth
ought to be based upon one's living experience. Idle reverie is not
their business, insist the followers of Zen. They, of course, sit
quietly and practise *zazen;* that must be done if they are to
assimilate whatever lessons they have gained while working. But as they
are opposed to "chewing the cud" all the time, they put into action
whatever reflections they have made during hours of quiet-sitting and
thus test their validity in the vital field of actualities. It is my
strong conviction that if the Zen monastery did not put faith in working
and keeping the blood of the monks circulating, the study of Zen would
have sunk into the level of a mere somniferous and trance-inducing
system, and all the treasures garnered by the masters in China and Japan
would have been cast away as of no more value than heaps of rotten
stuff.

The Meditation Hall, or Zendo as it is called in Japan, is a rectangular
building of different sizes according to the number of monks to be
accommodated. The one at Engakuji, Kamakura, is about 35 × 65 feet and
will take in thirty or forty monks. The space allotted to each monk is
one *tatami*, or a mat 3 × 6 feet, where he sits, meditates, and sleeps.
The bedding for each never exceeds one large wadded quilt about 5 × 6
feet, be it winter or summer. He has no regular pillow except that which
is temporarily made out of his own private property. This latter,
however, is next to nothing: it consists of a *kesa (kasaya)* and
*koromo* (priestly robes), a few books, a razor, and a set of bowls, all
of which are carried in a papier-mâché box about 13 × 10 ×*3^1/2^*
inches. In travelling this box is carried in front, suspended from the
neck with a broad sash. His entire property thus moves with its owner.
"One dress and one bowl, under a tree and on a stone" graphically
describes the monk's life in India. Compared with this, the modern Zen
monk must be said to be abundantly supplied. Still his wants are reduced
to a minimum and none can fail to lead a simple, perhaps the simplest,
life if he models his after the life of a Zen monk. The desire to
possess is considered by Buddhism to be one of the worst passions with
which mortals are apt to be obsessed. What, in fact, causes so much
misery in the world is the universal impulse of acquisition. As power is
desired, the strong always tyrannize over the weak; as wealth is
coveted, the rich and poor are always crossing swords of bitter enmity.
International wars rage, social unrest ever increases, unless this
impulse to get and to hold is completely uprooted. Cannot society be
reorganized upon an entirely different basis from what we have been used
to see from the beginning of history? Cannot we ever hope to stop the
massing of wealth and the accumulation of power merely from the desire
for individual or national aggrandizement? Despairing of the utter
irrationality of human affairs, Buddhist monks have gone to the other
extreme and cut themselves off even from reasonable and perfectly
innocent enjoyments of life. However, the Zen ideal of putting a monk's
belongings into a tiny box is his mute protest, though so far
ineffective, against the present order of society.

In India the Bhikshu never eats in the afternoon; he properly eats only
once a day; for his breakfast, in the American or English sense, is no
breakfast. The Zen monk is supposed to have no evening meal, but the
climatic necessity being impossible to ignore, he has a meal after a
fashion, but to ease his conscience he calls it "medicinal food". The
breakfast, which is taken very early in the morning while still dark,
consists of rice gruel and pickled vegetables. The principal meal is at
about ten in the morning and consists of rice (or rice mixed with
barley), vegetable soup, and pickles. In the afternoon, at four, they
have what was left from dinner, and no special cooking is done. Unless
invited out or given an extra treatment at home by some generous patron,
their meals are as described above, year in, year out. Poverty and
simplicity is their rule.

We ought not, however, to conclude that asceticism is an ideal of life
for Zen monks; for as far as the ultimate significance of Zen is
concerned, it is neither asceticism nor any other ethical system. If it
appears to advocate either the doctrine of suppression or that of
detachment, it is merely so on the surface, for Zen as a school of
general Buddhism inherits more or less the odium of the Hindu ascetic
discipline. The central idea, however, of the monk's life is not to
waste but to make the best possible use of things as they are given us,
which is also the spirit of Buddhism everywhere. In truth, the
intellect, the imagination, and all the other mental faculties as well
as the physical objects that surround us, our own bodies not being
excepted, are given for the unfolding and enhancing of the highest
powers possessed by us, and not merely for the gratification of
individual whims and desires, which are sure to conflict with and injure
the interests and rights to be asserted by others. These are some of the
inner ideas underlying the simplicity and poverty of the monk's life.

At meal-time a gong is struck and the monks come out of the Zendo in
procession carrying their own set of bowls to the dining-room, but do
not sit until the leader rings a bell. The bowls which each brings are
made of wood or paper and are well lacquered; they are usually four or
five in number and fit into one another like a nest. The sutra *(Hridaya
Sutra)* and the "five meditations" are recited, and then the monks who
are serving as waiters serve the soup and rice. They are now ready to
take up their chopsticks, but before they actually partake of their
sumptuous dinner, they think of those departed spirits and other beings
who are living in this and other worlds, and each taking out about seven
grains of rice from his portion offers them to the unseen. While eating
perfect quietude prevails; the dishes are handled noiselessly, no word
is uttered, no conversation goes on, and all their desires are indicated
by folding and rubbing their hands. Eating is a serious affair with
them. When another bowl of rice is wanted, the monk holds out his
folding hands, the waiter notices it and sits with the rice receptacle
before the hungry one; the latter takes up his bowl, lightly passes his
hand around the bottom to wipe off whatever dirt may have attached
itself and be likely to soil the hand of the waiter. While the bowl is
being filled, the eater keeps his hands folded; the rubbing of his palms
against each other shows that the waiter has put enough rice or soup in
his bowl.

The rule is that each monk should eat up all that is served him,
"gathering up the fragments that remain"; for that is their religion.
After a third or fourth helping of rice, the meal comes to an end. The
leader claps the wooden blocks and the waiters bring hot water; each
monk fills his largest bowl with it and in it all the other bowls are
neatly washed and wiped with the tiny napkin which is carried by him.
Then a wooden pail goes round to receive the slop; each monk gathers up
his dishes and wraps them up once more; the tables are now empty as
before except for the grains of rice that had been offered at the
beginning of the meal to the invisible beings. The wooden blocks are
clapped again and the monks leave the room in the same quiet and orderly
procession as they entered.

The industry of the monks is proverbial. When the day is not set for
study at home, they are generally seen soon after breakfast, about half
past five in summer and half past six in winter, out in the monastery
grounds or tilling the farm attached to the Zendo. Later, certain groups
of them go into the neighbouring villages to beg for rice. They keep the
monastery, inside and outside, in perfect order. When we say, "This is
like a Zen temple," it means that the place is kept in the neatest
possible order. Commonly attached to a Zendo are some patrons whose
homes are visited regularly for a supply of rice or vegetables. When
begging they will often go out miles away; they may often be seen along
a country road pulling a cart loaded with pumpkins or potatoes or
daikons. They sometimes go to the woods to gather fuel and kindling.
They know something of agriculture, too. As they have to support
themselves they are at once farmers, skilled workmen, and unskilled
labourers; they often build their own Zendo and other buildings under
the direction of an expert. Their labour is not at all perfunctory; they
work just as hard as ordinary labourers, perhaps harder, because to work
so is their religion.

The monks are a self-governing body; they have their own cooks,
proctors, managers, sextons, masters of ceremony, etc. Though the master
or teacher of a Zendo is its soul, he is not directly concerned with its
government, which is left to the senior members of the community, whose
character has been tested through many years of discipline. When the
principles of Zen are discussed, one may well marvel at their deep and
subtle "metaphysics" and imagine what a serious, pale-faced,
head-drooping, and world-forgetting group of people these monks must be;
but in their actual life they are very common mortals engaged in menial
work. They are cheerful, crack jokes, are ready to help one another, and
despise no work which is usually considered low and unworthy of a
cultured person. The spirit of Hyakujo is ever manifest here. The
faculties of the monks thus receive an all-round development. They
receive no formal or literary education, which is gained mostly from
books and abstract instructions; but what they do gain is practical and
efficient, for the basic principle of the Zendo life is "learning by
doing". They disdain soft education and look upon it as a predigested
food meant for convalescents. When a lioness gives birth to her cubs it
is proverbially believed that after three days she pushes them over a
precipice to see if they can climb back to her. Those that fail to meet
this test are no longer cared about. Whether this is true or not,
something like it is aimed at by the Zen master, who will often treat
his monks with every manner of seeming unkindness. The monks often have
not enough clothes for comfort, not enough food to satisfy hunger, not
enough time to sleep, and, to cap these, they have plenty of work, both
menial and spiritual. These outer necessities and inner aspirations,
working together upon the character of the monk, often end in producing
a fine specimen of humanity called a full-fledged Zen master. This
unique system of education, which is still going on in every Rinzai
Zendo, is not very well known among the laity, although there is at
present the tendency for the latter to get as much information as
possible of the life in the Zen monastery. But the merciless tide of
modern commercialism and mechanization is rolling all over the East, so
that almost no corners are left for a quiet retreat, and before long
even this solitary island of Zen may be buried under the waves of sordid
materialism. Even the monks themselves are beginning to misunderstand
the spirit of the early masters. Though we cannot deny the fact that
there are some things in this monastic education which may be improved,
its highly religious and reverential spirit toward life and work must be
preserved if Zen is to live at all for many years to come.

Theoretically, Zen envelops the whole universe and is not bound by the
rule of antithesis. But this is a very slippery ground and there are
many who fail to walk upright; and when they tumble the fall is quite
disastrous. Like some of the medieval mystics, Zen students sometimes
turn into libertines, losing all control of themselves; history is a
witness of such, and psychology can readily explain the process of such
degeneration. A Zen master once said: "Let a man's ideal rise as high as
the crown of Vairochana (highest divinity), but let his life be so full
of humility as to be prostrate even at the feet of a baby." The life in
a Zen monastery is minutely regulated and all the details are enforced
in strict obedience to the above spirit. This is what has saved Zen from
sinking to the level of some of the medieval mystics, and it is why the
Zendo plays so great a part in the teaching of Zen.

When Tanka (Tan-hsia) of the T'ang dynasty stopped at Yerinji in the
Capital, it was severely cold; so taking down one of the Buddha images
enshrined there, he made a fire of it and warmed himself. The keeper of
the shrine, seeing this, was greatly incensed, and exclaimed:

"How dare you burn my wooden image of the Buddha?"

Tanka began to search in the ashes as if he were looking for something,
and said:

"I am gathering the holy
*saurias[]{#calibre_link-184}[^3^](#calibre_link-103)* from the burnt
ashes."

"How," said the keeper, "can you get *sariras* from a wooden Buddha?"

Tanka retorted, "If there are no *sariras* to be found in it, may I have
the remaining two Buddhas for my fire?"

The shrine-keeper later lost both his eyebrows for remonstrating against
this apparent impiety of Tanka, while the Buddha's wrath never fell on
the latter.

Though I am doubtful of its historic accuracy, this story is notable and
all Zen masters agree as to the spiritual attainments of this
Buddha-desecrating Tanka. When a monk once asked his master about
Tanka's idea of burning a statue of Buddha, the master replied:

"When cold we sit around the hearth with fire burning."

"When hot we go to the bamboo-grove by the stream."

"Was he then at fault or not?"

Whatever the merit of Tanka from a purely Zen point of view, there is no
doubt that such deeds of Tanka are to be regarded as highly sacrilegious
and to be avoided by all pious Buddhists. Those who have not yet gained
a thorough understanding of Zen may go to all lengths of committing
every manner of excess and even crime---this in the name of Zen; and for
this reason the regulations of the monastery are very rigid that pride
of heart may depart and the cup of humility be drunk to the dregs.

When Shuko (Chu-hung) of the Ming dynasty was writing a book on the ten
laudable deeds of a monk, one of those self-assertive fellows came to
him, saying:

"What is the use of writing such a book when in Zen there is not even
the atom of a thing to be called laudable or not-laudable?"

Shuko answered, "The five aggregates *(skandha)* are entangling, and the
four elements *(mahabhuta)* grow rampant, and how can you say there are
no evils?"

The monk still insisted, "The four elements are ultimately all empty and
the five aggregates have no reality whatever."

Shuko, giving him a slap in the face, said, "So many are mere learned
ones; you are not the real thing yet; give me another answer."

But the monk made no answer and started to go away filled with angry
feelings.

"There," said the master smilingly, "why don't you wipe the dirt off
your own face?"

In the study of Zen, the power of an all-illuminating insight must go
hand in hand with a deep sense of humility and meekness of heart.

There is a period in the monastic life which is exclusively set apart
for the mental discipline of the monks, when they are not hampered by
any manual labour except such as is absolutely necessary. This period is
known as *sesshin*. It takes place a few times, each time lasting a
week, in the season known as the "summer sojourn" *(ge-ango)*, and again
in the one known as the "winter sojourn" *(setsu-ango)*. Generally
speaking, the summer sojourn begins in April and ends in August, while
the winter one begins in October and ends in February. *Sesshin* means
"collecting or concentrating the mind". While these *sesshins* last, the
monks are confined in the Zendo, get up earlier than usual and sit
further into the night. There is a "lecture" *(koza* or *teisho)* every
day during the *sesshin*. The textbook used may be any one of the Zen
books such as *The Hekiganshu, The Rinzairoku, The Mumon-kwan, The
Kidoroku, The Kwaian-kokugo*, etc. *The Rinzairoku* is a collection of
sermons or sayings of the founder of the Rinzai Zen sect. *The
Hekiganshu*, as mentioned before, is a collection of one hundred *koans*
annotated, expounded, and appreciated; *The Mumonkwan* is also a
collection of *koans*, forty-eight in number, with comments peculiar to
Zen, and much simpler than the *Hekigan. The Kidoroku* contains the
sayings, sermons, poems, and other works by Kido (Hsu-t'ang) of the Sung
dynasty. He was the teacher of Dai-o Kokushi, whose line of Zen
transmission is the one still flourishing in Japan. *The Kwaian-kokugo*
is the compilation by Hakuin of Daito Kokushi's sermons and critical
commentary verses on some of the old masters. To an ordinary reader
these books are a sort of *obscurum per obscurius*. After listening to a
series of lectures, the monk may be left in the same lurch as ever
unless he has opened an eye to the truth of Zen. This inscrutability is
not necessarily caused by the abstruse nature of the books, but because
the listener's mind is still encrusted with the hard shell of relative
consciousness.

During the *sesshin*, besides the lectures, the monks have what is known
as "*sanzen"*. To do *sanzen* is to go to the master and present their
views on the *koan* they have for the master's critical examination. In
the days when a great *sesshin* is not going on, *sanzen* will probably
take place twice a day, but during the special time of "thought
collection"---which is the meaning of *sesshin---* the monk has to see
the master four or five times a day. This seeing the master does not
take place openly; the monk is required to go individually to the
master's room, where the interview takes place in a most formal and
solemn manner. When the monk is about to cross the threshold, he makes
three bows, each time prostrating himself on the floor; he now enters
the room keeping his hands palm to palm in front of his chest, and when
he comes near the master he kneels down and makes still another
prostration. This ceremony over, no further worldly considerations are
entertained; if necessary from the Zen point of view, even blows may be
exchanged. To make manifest the truth of Zen with all sincerity of heart
is the sole consideration; everything else receives only subordinate
attention. The presentation over, the monk retires from the room with
the same elaborate ceremony with which he entered. This exercise may be
very trying on the master, for one *sanzen* for thirty monks will occupy
more than an hour and a half of most exacting attention.

Absolute confidence is placed in the master so far as his understanding
of Zen goes, but if the monk thinks he has sufficient reason for
doubting the master's ability he may settle it with him personally at
the time of *sanzen*. This presentation of views, therefore, is no idle
play for either master or monk. It is, indeed, a most serious affair,
and because it is so this discipline of Zen has great moral value. To
illustrate this let us consider an incident from the life of Hakuin, the
founder of modern Rinzai Zen in Japan.

One summer evening when Hakuin came to present his view to his old
master, who was cooling himself on the veranda, the master rudely said,
"Stuff and nonsense!" Hakuin repeated loudly, "Stuff and nonsense!"
Thereupon the master seized him, boxed his ear, and finally pushed him
off the veranda. As it had been raining, poor Hakuin found himself
rolling in mud and water. When he recovered himself he returned to the
veranda and bowed to the master, who retorted, "O you denizen of the
dark cavern!"

Another day, thinking that the master failed to really appreciate the
depths of his knowledge of Zen, Hakuin desired to have a settlement with
him anyhow. When the time came Hakuin entered the master's room and
exhausted all his ingenuity in contest with him, making up his mind this
time not to give up an inch of ground. The master was furious, and
finally taking hold of Hakuin gave him several slaps and pushed him off
the porch. He fell several feet to the foot of a stone wall, where he
remained for a while almost senseless. The master looked down at him and
laughed heartily; this brought Hakuin back to consciousness, and when he
came back to the master he was all in perspiration. The master, however,
did not release him yet but stigmatized him as before, "O you denizen of
the dark cavern!"

Hakuin grew desperate and thought of leaving the old master altogether,
when one day as he was going about begging in the village a certain
accident suddenly opened his eye to the truth of Zen, which had hitherto
been completely hidden from him. His joy knew no bounds and he came back
to the master in a most exalted state of mind. Before he could enter the
front gate, the master recognized that something had happened to him and
beckoned to him saying: "What good news have you brought home today?
Come right in, be quick, quick!" Hakuin then told him all about what he
had gone through during the day. The master tenderly stroked him on the
back and said, "You have it now; you have it at last!" After this the
master never called him names.

Such was the training the father of modern Japanese Zen had to go
through. How terribly hard his old master, Shoju, was when he pushed
Hakuin over the stone wall! But how motherly he was when his disciple,
after so much ill-treatment, finally came out triumphantly! Indeed,
there is nothing lukewarm in Zen; if it is lukewarm, it is not Zen. It
expects one to penetrate into the very depths of truth, and the truth
can never be grasped until, stripped of all trumperies, intellectual or
otherwise, one returns to one's own native nakedness. Each slap dealt by
Shoju stripped Hakuin of his illusions and insincerities. In fact, we
are all living under many casings of illusions and insincerities which
really have nothing to do with our inmost Self. To reach this inmost
Self, therefore, whereby the disciple gains real knowledge of Zen, the
master often resorts to methods seemingly inhuman; indeed, far from
being kindhearted to say the least.

In the life of the Zendo there is no fixed period of graduation as in
public education. With some, graduation may not take place after twenty
years of living there, but with ordinary abilities and a good amount of
perseverance and indefatigability a monk is able to probe within a space
of ten years into every intricacy of the teachings of Zen. To practise
the principles of Zen, however, in every moment of life---that is, to
become fully saturated in the spirit of Zen---is another matter. One
life may be too short for it; for it is said that even Sakyamuni and
Maitreya themselves are yet in the midst of self-training.

To become a perfectly qualified master, a mere understanding of the
truth of Zen is not sufficient. He must go through a period which is
known as "the long maturing of the sacred womb". The term must have come
originally from Taoism; but in Zen nowadays it means, broadly speaking,
living a life harmonious with the understanding. Under the direction of
a competent master a monk may finally attain to a thorough knowledge of
all the mysteries of Zen, but it will be more or less intellectual
though in the highest possible sense. The monk's life, in and out, must
grow in perfect unison with this attainment. To do this a further
self-training is necessary, for what he has gained in the Zendo is after
all only the pointing of the finger in the direction where his utmost
efforts must further be put forth. But it is no longer imperative for
him to remain in the Zendo; on the contrary, his intellectual
attainments must be put on trial by coming into actual contact with the
world. There are no prescribed rules for this "maturing". Each must act
under his own discretion as he meets with the accidental circumstances
of life. He may retire into the mountains and live as a solitary hermit,
or he may come out into the market and be an active participant in all
the affairs of the world. The Sixth Patriarch is said to have lived
among the mountaineers for fifteen years after he had left the Fifth
Patriarch. He was quite unknown in the world when he first returned to
hear a lecture by Inshu (Yin-tsung). Chu (Chung), the national teacher,
spent forty years in Nang-yang and never showed himself out in the city.
But his holy life became known far and near, and at the earnest request
of the Emperor he finally left his hut. Yisan (Kuei-shan) spent several
years in the wilderness, living on nuts and befriending monkeys and
deer. He was found out, however, and great monasteries were built about
his anchorage, and he became the master of one thousand and five hundred
monks. Kwanzan, the founder of the great Myoshinji in Kyoto, lived at
first a retired life in Mino Province, working for the villagers as a
day labourer. Nobody recognized him until one day an accident disclosed
his identity and the Court insisted on his founding a monastery in the
Capital.

In the beginning of his career Hakuin was the keeper of a deserted
temple in Suruga, which was his sole heritage in the world. We can
picture to ourselves the extent of its dilapidation when we read this
account: "There were no roofs properly speaking, and the stars shone
through at night, nor were there any decent floors. It was necessary to
have a rain-hat and to wear high *getas* if it rained when anything was
going on in the main part of the temple. All the property attached to
the temple was in the hands of creditors, and the priestly belongings
were mortgaged to the trades-people. ..."

The history of Zen gives many such examples of great masters who emerged
into the world after a period of retirement. The idea is not the
practice of asceticism, but is the "maturing", as has been properly
designated, of one's moral character. Many serpents and adders are
waiting at the porch, and if one fails to trample them down effectively
they raise their heads again, and the whole edifice of moral culture
built up in vision may collapse even in a day. Antinomianism is also a
pitfall for the followers of Zen, against which constant vigil is
needed.

In some respects, no doubt, this kind of monastic education that
prevails in the Zendo is behind the times; but its guiding principles,
such as the simplification of life, restraint of desires, not wasting a
moment icily, self-independence, and what they call "secret virtue", are
sound for all lands and in all ages. Especially is this true of the
concept of "secret virtue", which is a very characteristic feature of
Zen discipline. It means not to waste natural resources; it means to
make full use, economic and moral, of everything that comes your way; it
means to treat yourself and the world in the most appreciative and
reverential frame of mind. It particularly means practising goodness
without any thought of recognition by others. A child is drowning; I get
into the water, and the child is saved. That is all there is to be done
in the case; what is done is done. I walk away, I never look backward,
and nothing more is thought of it. A cloud passes and the sky is as blue
as ever and as broad. Zen calls it "a deed without merit"
*(anabhogacarya)*, and compares it to a man's work who tries to fill up
a well with show.

Jesus said, "When thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
right hand doeth; that thine alms may be in secret." This is the "secret
virtue" of Buddhism. But when the account goes on to say that "Thy
Father who seeth in secret shall recompense thee", we see a deep
cleavage between Buddhism and Christianity. As long as there is any
thought of anybody, be he God or devil, knowing of our doings and making
recompense, Zen would say, "You are not yet one of us." Deeds that are
the product of such thought leave "traces" and "shadows". If a spirit is
tracing your doings, he will in no time get hold of you and make you
account for what you have done; Zen will have none of it. The perfect
garment shows no seams, inside and outside; it is one complete piece and
nobody can tell where the work began, or how it was woven. In Zen,
therefore, no traces of self-conceit or self-glorification are to be
left behind even after the doing of good, much less the thought of
recompense, even by God.

Resshi (Lieh-tzu), the Chinese philosopher, describes this frame of mind
in a most graphic manner:

"I allowed my mind without restraint to think of what it pleased, and my
mouth to talk about whatever it pleased; I then forgot whether 'this and
not-this' was mine or others', whether the gain or loss was mine or
others'; nor did I know whether Lao-shang-shih was my teacher and Pa-kao
was my friend. In and out, I was thoroughly transformed; and then it was
that the eye became like the ear, and the ear like the nose, and the
nose like the mouth; and there was nothing that was not identified. As
the mind became concentrated, the form dissolved, the bones and flesh
all thawed away; I did not know upon what my frame was supported, or
where my feet were treading; I just moved along with the wind, east or
west, like a leaf of the tree detached from its stem; I was unconscious
whether I was riding on the wind, or the wind riding on me."

This kind of virtue is called by the German mystics "poverty"; and
Tauler's definition is, "Absolute poverty is thine when thou canst not
remember whether anybody has owed thee or been indebted to thee for
anything; just as all things will be forgotten by thee in the last
journey of death."

In Christianity we seem to be too conscious of God, though we say that
in him we live and move and have our being. Zen wants to have this last
trace of God-consciousness, if possible, obliterated. That is why Zen
masters advise us not to linger where the Buddha is, and to pass quickly
away where he is not. All the training of the monk in the Zendo, in
practice as well as in theory, is based on this principle of "meritless
deed". Poetically this idea is expressed as follows:

> The bamboo-shadows move over the stone steps

>         as if to sweep them, but no dust is stirred;

> The moon is reflected deep in the pool, but the

>         water shows no trace of its penetration.

Taking it all in all, Zen is emphatically a matter of personal
experience; if anything can be called radically empirical, it is Zen. No
amount of reading, no amount of teaching, no amount of contemplation
will ever make one a Zen master. Life itself must be grasped in the
midst of its flow; to stop it for examination and analysis is to kill
it, leaving its cold corpse to be embraced. Therefore, everything in the
Meditation Hall and every detail of its disciplinary curriculum is so
arranged as to bring this idea into the most efficient prominence. The
unique position maintained by the Zen sect among the other Buddhist
sects in Japan and China throughout the history of Buddhism in the Far
East is no doubt due to the institution known as the Meditation Hall, or
Zendo.

[]{#calibre_link-60}[^1^](#calibre_link-146) To be accurate, the
fundamental ideas of the Mahayana are expounded in the Prajnaparamita
group of Buddhist literature, the earliest of which must have appeared
at the latest within three hundred years of the Buddha's death. The
germs are no doubt in the writings belonging to the so-called primitive
Buddhism. Only their development, that is, a conscious grasp of them as
most essential in the teachings of the founder, could not be effected
without his followers' actually living the teachings for some time
through the variously changing conditions of life. Thus enriched in
experience and matured in reflection, the Indian Buddhists came to have
the Mahayana form of Buddhism as distinguished from its primitive or
original form. In India two Mahayana schools are known: the Madhyamika
of Nagarjuna and the Vijnaptimatra or Yogacara of Asanga and Vasubandhu.
In China more schools developed: the Tendai *(t'ien-tai),* the Kegon
(*avatamsaka*), the Jodo *(ching-t'u)*, the Zen *(ch'an)*, etc. In Japan
we have besides these the Hokke, the Shingon, the Shin, the Ji, etc. All
these schools or sects belong to the Mahayana wing of Buddhism.

*zazen* may be summarily taken as meaning "to sit in meditation". What
it exactly signifies will be seen later in connection with the
description of "The Meditation Hall" (*zendo*, J.; *ch'an-t'ang*, Ch.).
