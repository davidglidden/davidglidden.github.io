*For it's always that way with the sacred value of life. We forget it as long as it belongs to us, and give it as little attention during the unconcerned hours of our life as we do the stars in the light of day.

From 'At This Dark Hour', a speech given by Stefan Zweig to the US PEN Club in New York, May 1941
:::

## I {#9781782271468_introduction.html_h21}

During his prodigious writing life the perennially curious Stefan Zweig was drawn to certain historically influential figures in the fields of art and music but especially literature. Balzac, Stendhal, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Dante, []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_8}Goethe, Nietzsche---Zweig wrote something substantial on them all, but he also penned shorter portraits of a range of less iconic Europeans, most of which have yet to find their way into English. Often these biographical studies seemed intricately bound to Zweig's own destiny or came about in unforeseen ways. Despite his late-found love for the relative calm of fog-bound London and the merits of the British obsession with gardening, Zweig states in his autobiography *The World of Yesterday*: "My books had all been translated into English but were little known there. Britain had always been the country where they made least impression." But it was in London during the winter of 1934, in the aftermath of his hasty evacuation from Salzburg, that, charmed by the library of prints and manuscripts in the British Museum, Zweig happened upon a handwritten account of the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots. This discovery led to yet another biography, even though Zweig professed to be tiring of the genre, having just completed the study of Erasmus in which he used the great humanist and theologian as a template to espouse his own convictions. Again and again Zweig's curiosity got the better of him, and he could not help but be deflected to follow an interesting scent. It was this fascination with the []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_9}personalities of history, and in many cases his realization of the parlous state of existing literary biography around a subject, that impelled Zweig to deliver his own psychologically tinted verdict.

Zweig tended to explore controversial, heroic or, in rare cases, demonic personalities beyond the world of literature, those who harnessed themselves to justice or a moral crusade, those battling against religious authority or state, or controversial women of note destined to become the figurines of popular history, trapped in a glass case of skewed public perception. But humanists and ill-fated queens aside, Zweig also delved into the darker recesses of history, one of his most successful books being an account of the exploits of Joseph Fouché, the ruthless enforcer in revolutionary France who took down Robespierre. Unsurprisingly, this book, Zweig tells us, was widely discussed and admired in Nazi circles, since it dealt with a man without scruples.

Like any writer, Zweig strongly identified with those who had passed before him on a similar path, and sensed a fraternal bond with these fellow travellers. In significant moments of upheaval in his life, it tended to be those harbouring a noble-minded, humanistic agenda, a unifying spirit, an inner belief in the betterment of []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_10}man, who garnered Zweig's admiration and support. The lone figure who shrank from sectarianism and struggled to remain true to his own values in epochs which seemed to foreshadow his own, drew Zweig's avid attention. Along with Erasmus, one may add Sebastian Castellio, who occupied Zweig at the same time, in the period when his exile was not complete and he could still travel widely. As Hitler primed Europe for an unrivalled explosion of barbarism, Zweig looked to history to provide comparisons, in order to make sense of the catastrophe engulfing the continent. A decade earlier he had been immersed in an altogether different question, the conundrum of the destructive yet creatively enabling "demon", residing in such eminently tortured spirits as Nietzsche, Friedrich Hölderlin and Heinrich von Kleist, whose unavoidable, self-destructive trajectories provided him with his trilogy *The Struggle with the Daemon* (1925). This was the second of his three 'Master Builders of the Spirit' trilogies. Preceding this had been a volume containing studies of Dostoevsky, Balzac and Dickens (1920), and the series concluded with Casanova, Stendhal and Tolstoy in 1928.

Arguably the most important encounter, and the one whose implications remain hitherto unsung, especially in the English-speaking world, occurred in the autumn []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_11}of 1941, in Petrópolis, Brazil, when, at the eleventh hour, Zweig discovered one Michel de Montaigne. For it was here in the spartan bungalow perched above the jungle, where the Zweigs were to spend the last pensive months of their lives, that Stefan, exploring the damp cellar soon after arrival, stumbled upon a "dusty old edition" of Montaigne's famous Essais. The seemingly random discovery, "*einen* *grossen Fund*", as he excitedly called it later in a letter to his ex-wife Friderike von Winternitz, proved a fateful intercession, and the sudden all-encompassing focus on Montaigne would eclipse competing works in progress during Zweig's final months. More than any literary seduction, the stricken exile, so bereft of comradeship, was spiritually rewarded with a new-found friend, a fraternal counsellor speaking from a distance of four centuries, whose example chimed with Zweig's ever more powerful inward convictions concerning personal freedom in the face of tyranny and the absolute necessity to remain true to oneself.

Zweig writes to Friderike from Petrópolis on 14th October 1941, striving to maintain the facade of a blessed rural bolthole: "I hardly ever venture into Rio; rather, I savour the reading of Montaigne, Goethe, Shakespeare and continue my work, that is to say lead []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_12}that normal life of which I have been deprived since the arrival of the war."

Suddenly Montaigne has joined the list of great men. The new discovery swiftly became the crutch that Zweig, with waning fortitude, reached for over that final winter, as any prospect of a future in which a scrap of magnanimity might be salvaged seemed lost to a brutalizing present. For Zweig the abyss left in the terrain of world history by Nazism was just too big to bridge or circumnavigate and any attempt to do so would be grotesque. Mauled by depression, starved of European blood, Montaigne provided the last vital vein to a European heritage which had formerly sustained Zweig's whole being. But ironically it was also his avid reading of Montaigne which contributed to Zweig's decision to take his own life in February 1942.

The latent pessimism which had dogged Zweig for years, the sense of a closing nameless threat, was seeded after the perverse mass slaughter of the First World War and break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Zweig's fears were confirmed by the nationalist agitation which preceded his departure into exile in 1933. Once the initial 1918 armistice optimism had ebbed, Zweig became ever more aware that the interwar period was []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_13}merely a vestibule to an even greater convulsion of destruction, which had not yet revealed its contours. Yet during the 1920s Zweig was at his zenith, in terms of literary acclaim, global fame and material reward. He pertinently describes this glittering period before the 1933 collapse at some length in *The World of Yesterday*: the beatified writer ensconced in a beautiful and ancient city at the peaceable heart of Europe, felicitously holding court in his Kapuzinerberg eyrie, the swollen library and extraordinary rare-manuscript collection gathered protectively around him, his achievements as yet untainted by the trickle of militancy and bestial hatred seeping into the valleys below. Then his near neighbour descended from his own peak on the Obersalzberg and Zweig was impelled to dismantle his life almost overnight, uprooting himself from his home in Salzburg and leaving his precious library mothballed.

## II {#9781782271468_introduction.html_h22}

Zweig's passion for travel and new horizons was not just about the conventional pleasure of discovery of the new, or of escape from the familiar, but was a physical []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_14}articulation of the spontaneity and unpredictability he needed for the creative process. He blossomed on the move. He was productive in motion. Countless letters to friends are penned on lavishly headed hotel writing paper from all corners of Europe. For the European honeycomb itself was Zweig's office, the train compartment and the hotel room, the lobby, the ship's cabin, the station waiting room. This restless, almost febrile fluidity, this suppleness of day-to-day existence, the power to alight then lift off at will, extended to his possessions. Zweig always maintained he was not a collector for its own sake, that he did not amass objects to savour them in private; rather, he saw himself as a temporary guardian, whose thrill was in tracking down a key treasure and, by securing it, creating a spiritually ennobling ensemble with other treasures, a cultural edifice that furthered a humanist set of values. Even here Zweig was attempting unification, a harmonious realignment of elements:

::: {#9781782271468_introduction.html_extract1 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
Of course I never considered myself the owner of these things, only their custodian... I was intrigued by the idea of bringing them together, making a collection into a work of art. I was aware that in []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_15}this collection I had created something that in itself was worthier to last than my own works.
:::

But as European conflict again snapped at Zweig's heels, his inner despair reasserted itself, the great despair that Europe, the Europe he and his high-minded friends had striven to unite in the sharing of culture, was destined now to destroy itself. Zweig mentions this overriding presentiment throughout the latter stages of his autobiography: "I felt that Europe, in its state of derangement, had passed its own death sentence, our sacred home of Europe."

Zweig had been dragging this despair along with him from country to country throughout the 1930s, and like a snowball it became greater and heavier the further it travelled. Zweig knew this travelling might be his last in Europe, and so he tried to make the most of it, but everywhere he went in Spain, in Italy, in France, he witnessed disparate omens of oncoming disintegration. Zweig was aghast to observe, while holed up in his London flat, how the British were ruthlessly outmanoeuvred by Hitler, "abused by brilliant propaganda". Zweig had grimly observed Hitler's proven method of pushing a little more with every gain, and how each time "the []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_16}hook was skilfully baited". The tragedy is that Zweig only witnessed the tyrant's brilliantly diabolical ascension and not his catastrophic and ignominious descent.

After Hitler's annexations of Austria and Czechoslovakia the heavy-duty exile began. Then came the shock wave of Poland, the unthinkable fall of France, the threat to Britain of imminent invasion, news of mounting atrocities against Jews in Reich-occupied territories. The wall of circumstance which the newly registered "enemy alien" Zweig now had to scale, just to reach a sprig of hope, grew ever higher. Severance with Europe was now inevitable and would perhaps be irrevocable. Zweig's hopes turned to continents beyond Hitler's reach. These vast countries brimming with natural resources and populations untainted by the poison of European nationalism seemed to hold new promise: "But travelling, even as far as to other worlds under other stars, did not allow me to escape Europe and my anxieties. However far I went from Europe, its fate came with me."

Disillusioned by the American way of life and the sapping heat of New York during the summer of 1941, Zweig opted for Brazil, which he called the "land of the future", where he had been feted before. Here Zweig, stripped of the weight of possessions left behind in []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_17}England, sought a newly productive solitude, a chance to reacquaint himself with his vocation on the most elemental level, to leave the European madhouse behind and simply to write, to complete his study of Balzac... Then, like a man who during a long illness suddenly appears to recover for a moment and glow with renewed hope, Zweig carried Montaigne up from the cellar, and without delay set out to tell the world why this incomparable man of letters, four centuries dead, mattered now in moral terms and how, in an intolerable period of history, Montaigne showed better than anyone else that one could still remain free.

Zweig always saw himself as a lesser figure in his relationship with the great artists he chose to illuminate, learning from, championing, but never equalling them. He seems, according to remarks made in letters and elsewhere, to have had little faith that his own work would survive and to have been more committed to ensuring that the work of others deemed greater did. This impulsion began with his almost fanatical championing of the work of the Belgian poet Emile Verhaeren before the First World War. Zweig's role was as committed servant, a willing mediator between master past and apprentice present, diligently escorting []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_18}the chosen gilt minds across to new generations, tending their achievements on European soil in order to stimulate future harvests. This zealous talent scout of history revealed at the opportune moment the key elements of a subject's character, their position in a particular epoch, the example they left, their heroism or heroic failure, elements which chimed with his own inward preoccupations, sustained his conception of solitary labour as artistic sacrifice, or lent credence to the trajectory of passionate engagement with life he sought to follow. Ever since extricating himself from the stifling enclaves of self-regarding Vienna at the turn of the century, then slumming it in the shabbier avant-garde dens of Berlin, Zweig had resisted any facade and sought out the vital creative spark. He swooped on the adventurer, the square peg in a round hole, the lonely individual battling against the unseeing masses and forcing a way through to authenticity. He enthused over the vitality, the courage and single-mindedness of those poets, writers and humanist thinkers who followed their undeviating path, even unto banishment, morbid isolation, the asylum or early death. In Europe's collective cultural achievement, its historic cornerstones laid by the genius of select individuals, Zweig saw the European ideal he []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_19}treasured above all else. Whatever he himself produced were but single bricks placed here and there in the edifice. Without them the rest would still stand.

In his biographical portraits Zweig demonstrated the psychological prowess so successfully employed in his short stories and novels. By doing this he presumably felt he had performed a "deeper reading" of the text, grasped the subject's underlying vision, inner spirit or humanistic resonance. It was not enough to enjoy just reading and rereading the works; Zweig was determined to explore the path his subject took from dark to light, or vice versa. No sooner had Zweig stumbled on a subject, whether Erasmus, Kleist, Marie Antoinette, Magellan or Montaigne, than he was frantically scouring the libraries for research material, having the faithful Friderike compile a list of books and studiously re-examining the period in which the subject lived and their place in it.

## III {#9781782271468_introduction.html_h23}

Zweig's special love for France, its Latin culture and its incomparable artistic capital was long-standing. His admiration for French literature, art and history was []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_20}forged during his schooldays, and it was then that he had first acknowledged Montaigne's presence in the roll call of greats and registered the artistic value of his *oeuvre*. But as Zweig explains at the opening of the essay, as a young man he had respectfully consigned Montaigne to the past, his noble entreaties and bookish delvings seeming dusty and out of step with the glittering upsurge of the new century. Freedom and tolerance now seemed assured; therefore, "it seemed to our generation that Montaigne was simply rattling chains we thought long since broken". For the next four decades the legendary sixteenth-century French writer of the *Essais* remained for Zweig merely a mute bust standing in the shadows. As Donald Prater explains in his biography of Zweig, *European of Yesterday* (Oxford, 1972), although the writer's rediscovery of Montaigne seemed random, this "chance", like his discovery of humanistic high priests Emile Verhaeren and Romain Rolland, seemed to have been "determined from within". It also appeared more than chance that one of the few books his friend and fellow exile in Brazil, the German writer Ernst Feder, had left from his former library proved to be the most complete edition of the *Essais*. Not only this but one of the foremost experts on Montaigne, Fortunat Strowski, []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_21}also happened to be in Brazil at this time. Strowski gladly offered his services and his own books to Zweig, among them a work on Montaigne by André Gide. Between October and December 1941, Zweig was obliged to put aside his unfinished Balzac, as the material he needed was delayed in England. Since 1940, Zweig had also been toying with a study of André Chénier, whom he could portray as poet-victim of the Revolution, another willing symbol of the individual struggling against the fanaticism and brutality of the crowd. But it was the less colourful story of Montaigne which would now serve the same purpose, and this project swept aside all other considerations. In a letter to Friderike on 27th October 1941, Zweig says:

::: {#9781782271468_introduction.html_extract2 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
To write something on Montaigne, whom I now read avidly and with such pleasure, has entirely seduced me; he is another (a better) Erasmus, a wholly consoling spirit. But here there is virtually nothing available on him and I have no idea if I can even find the books I need from America. The whole atmosphere of an epoch is indispensable if one is properly to understand the man who lived in it.
:::

[]{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_22}In one of his last letters to his publisher, in February 1942, Zweig lists the Montaigne as "no more than a preliminary sketch", unlike the 'Chess' short story, which was finished. Yet this small book of some eighty pages, published after Zweig's death by Richard Friedenthal in the collection *Europäisches Erbe* ('European Heir'), gives the impression of a complete work. Having said that, the reader must understand that errors necessarily exist, and there is some confusion regarding the prodigious quotations and from which volumes of the *Essais* they originate. There are also repetitions, for example on the question of Montaigne as "mediator", a role which echoes that of Zweig, and the recurring image of the "inner citadel", from Goethe. I think it fair to presume Zweig would have swept out most of these gremlins before publication, had he lived. As in his Nietzsche portrait, Zweig sidesteps the author's work itself and delves into Montaigne's personal life, its domestic demands and intimate sufferings. Scouring journals and letters, Zweig finds the confirmation he needs and quotes Montaigne lavishly. The book takes a more or less conventional biographical route, lingering on family background, detailing the radical humanist education of the prodigy, then moves into Montaigne's mature years in the tower, []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_23}an eleventh-hour dalliance with love, then on to perpetuity. But around this Zweig weaves the incredible tapestry with its repeated motif of Montaigne as exemplar of the free spirit, the man for all time, an exceptional example of moral certitude encapsulated within a single being. There are nine chapters, of which only the fifth and seventh bear titles. Zweig had clearly not yet decided on the remainder. As was his wont, the text is littered with long quotations, given without references, and in this he echoes the style of Montaigne himself. There are also numerous words and phrases in the original French, a language in which Zweig was wholly proficient by this time. He clearly relished peppering the text with these Gallic morsels, not out of pretension or for effect, but because they bring Montaigne closer, emphasize a point or seem apposite.

Zweig's vision of Montaigne as a fraternal spirit, an existential soulmate, "*eine* *Bruderschaft des Schicksales*",[[\*](#9781782271468_introduction.html_rw-num-footnote-2)]{#9781782271468_introduction.html_rw-ref-footnote-2 .ref-footnote} formed at a moment of extreme vulnerability, cannot be underestimated. But Montaigne also stood in for those European friendships now in limbo. In a letter to Jules Romains, Zweig described his subject as "the good Montaigne, who in my solitude replaces my distant []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_24}friends". Montaigne is like an old friend who has called on him to provide wise counsel in a grave moment "*nostra* *res* *agitur*".[[\*](#9781782271468_introduction.html_rw-num-footnote-3)]{#9781782271468_introduction.html_rw-ref-footnote-3 .ref-footnote} Zweig revels in Montaigne's formidable independent spirit: "not a son and citizen of a race or a fixed place, but a citizen of the world, beyond any land or time". Such exaltation can border on the rhetorical, because in his struggle to espouse the dignity of individual courage and forbearance in a moral stand, Zweig holds up Montaigne like a mirror, slightly distorted to serve his own preoccupations. And though we sense this on occasion, somehow the procession of shimmering psychological "evidence" that Zweig conjures up around the cornerstone of "How can I remain free?" draws us on. We feel sympathy because Zweig's enthusiasm is genuine. His need to wrest some shred of dignity, via an individual's real or imagined inward purity, to salvage something out of Europe's communal cataclysm, is courageous yet tragic, and ultimately moving given the closeness of his death.

Listing the various ways Montaigne has been drily interpreted by scholars, Zweig firmly casts him as torch-bearer for preserving one's inner authenticity, the man who rejected encroaching sectarianism and []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_25}simply withdrew, both physically and mentally. "In him I see the ancestor, the protector and the friend of each '*homme* *libre*' on earth, the most adept master at this new yet eternal science, the preserving of oneself above all other concerns."

This calm, decisive, noble leave-taking seduces the depleted Zweig, who has agonized, who has struggled gamely in the straitjacket of commitments, of expectations, of demands. The anchorite Montaigne is sequestered in the famous tower, insulated from the madness beyond by a womb of books like those Zweig has left behind in Salzburg. Then Zweig reveals his torment:

::: {#9781782271468_introduction.html_extract3 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
How to remain free? How to preserve the incorruptible lucidity of my spirit faced with all the threats and dangers of sectarian turmoil? How to keep humanity intact in the throes of bestiality? How to escape the tyrannical demands that the state and Church seek to impose on me? How to protect that unique part of my soul against enforced submission to rules and measures dictated from outside? How to safeguard the deepest region of my spirit and its matter which belongs to me alone, my body, my health, my thoughts, my feelings, from the danger []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_26}of being sacrificed to the deranged prejudices of others, to serve interests which are not my own?
:::

Living in exile in the US and Britain during 1939 and 1940, Zweig had struggled to remain apart from the political, not to be drawn one way or the other, and he had been castigated for it. His lofty appeals for inner resistance seemed absurd and vague, out of touch, given the gravity of the situation. His self-confessed hatred of emotional public appeals had left him floundering before frustrated expectation. Now Montaigne, who artfully slipped out of the grasp of factions, of warring groups, of the crowd, suddenly looms from the dark thicket of war, and for Zweig his undying lamp in the tower window becomes a beacon of hope. In Montaigne's stand, his decision to disengage from the external, Zweig sees a way out, if only in the imagination, of his own increasing sense of disempowerment, the languorous nihilism of exile, the feeling that the epoch's implications are just too overwhelming to resist. As with the poet Verhaeren decades before, Zweig thrills to this all-embracing spirit: "For him all that is natural is to be celebrated." Montaigne shows the way for the high-minded empirical man. "We too need to stand the test, to endure one of the most []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_27}horrifying collapses of humanity, which follows directly one of its most magnificent periods of advancement." With 1914 in mind, and the squandered glories of the enlightenment, Zweig laments the perennial blindness of men who only see what they have lost when it is too late. He recounts the dizzying rise of the Renaissance and humanism, then the subsequent fall into chaos and bloodshed, all echoing the loss of "the golden age" to the present cataclysm.

For Zweig, Montaigne is the archetypal man of tolerance who abhors all rigid thought and dogma, the great sceptic. He is, like Zweig, the man who builds bridges, who meanders rather than takes straight paths; above all he is the great conciliator, "*der ideale* *Vermittler*", the man who is used by others to facilitate negotiations, since he stands apart from any faction. He is also the reader par excellence, the eclectic enjoyer of books rather than a mere scholar. "He wants to read and learn, but only so far as he can savour the experience."

It is this "experience" which for Zweig is paramount. Writing is only a means to an end, that of relishing life to the full: "He writes---but he is not a writer. Writing for him is only a substitute." What starts as a diversion becomes a serious undertaking: "What do I know?" []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_28}asks Montaigne. In order to answer this he gleans from history the fruits of antiquity, and again when Zweig discusses Montaigne it is Zweig himself who seems to stand before us:

::: {#9781782271468_introduction.html_extract4 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
He explores "the rich souls of times past" to correlate them with his own. He studies virtues, vices, flaws and merits, the wisdom and puerility of others. History is his great instruction manual, for, as he says, it is in his actions that man reveals himself.
:::

There is a poignant passage concerning Montaigne's tower library in which Zweig pines for the pleasure of selecting books and reading them, as well as for the art of reading randomly, of engaging intuitively and for pleasure alone. Here we see Zweig set down through the prism of Montaigne his final thoughts on the "friends" he has left scattered in libraries far behind him:

::: {#9781782271468_introduction.html_extract5 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
For him books are not like men, who impose themselves and burden him with their chatter, and of whom it is hard to be rid. When you don't call for them they stay put; you can just pick up this one or that, according to your whim: "Books are my []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_29}kingdom. And here I seek to reign as absolute lord." Books offer him their opinion and he responds with his own. They express their thoughts and arouse in him further thoughts. They do not disturb him when he is silent; they only speak when he questions them. Here is his realm. They await his delectation.
:::

When Montaigne finally tires of his tower and travels to Italy, Zweig, the seasoned traveller, approves of his unconventional behaviour, his roaming at random, his unwillingness to be a passive traveller: "to be travelled". Even when travelling on horseback in foreign lands, he goes his own way, departing from his retinue. As in his reading tastes, Montaigne is wide-ranging, seeking life itself and eschewing pretence. Avoiding the more obvious sites, he prefers to engage with real people, spending time with local courtesans and workers rather than ticking off ancient monuments. There are other overlaps. Zweig and Montaigne were both born into bourgeois mercantile backgrounds; Zweig explores the family history early in the essay, showing how the Eyquem clan, later to be the Montaignes, clawed their way out of the "trade" classes to acquire the chateau and the social distinction of public office. Montaigne's unwillingness []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_30}to mention his Jewish mother strikes Zweig for personal reasons; Zweig also shows how indifferent Montaigne appears to be to his female relations, despite sharing the chateau with them, almost acting as if they do not exist. Ironically and arguably a little unfairly, this is something Zweig himself has been accused of, since his own wife and family are rarely mentioned in his autobiography.

Crucially, it was Montaigne who "assisted" Zweig's suicide, particularly through the essay 'A Custom of the Isle of Cea', whose principal theme is the question of a willed death, the idea that it is more noble for a man of ideals to depart voluntarily when life becomes unbearable than to remain alive at all costs:

::: {#9781782271468_introduction.html_extract6 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
The most just death is that which is most willed. Our lives depend on the will of others, but death on ourselves alone. There is nothing to which we should apply ourselves more than this. Reputation has no place here and it is folly to think of it. Life is servitude if we lack the freedom to die.
:::

Only two days before his death Zweig wrote to his friend René Fülöp-Miller encouraging him to read Montaigne, and included the first line of the above quotation.

[]{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_31}Of course it is impossible to know exactly how influential this essay was on Zweig's ultimate decision, but on reading it there can be little doubt that it was fateful, to say the least: "Death is a certain refuge, never to be feared"; "Strong diseases require strong remedies", writes Montaigne conspiratorially, as if spying a pondering Zweig slumped in his cane chair on the sultry veranda. Saturated with vivid examples of men from antiquity who met the most gruesome and outlandish ends at their own hands, Montaigne's essay is a persuasive account of the philosophical reasoning behind an early exit in order to avoid even worse pain, humiliation or the indignity of meaningless servitude to life for life's sake. Arriving at the "propitious" moment, Zweig seized on the justifications within and in his depressed state felt that these historic precedents compared favourably with his own experience. After all, had Montaigne not "counselled" him on so many other areas of existence?

Montaigne's musings on ending his own life, when suffering the excruciating pain of kidney stones, are cited several times in Zweig's essay. It is telling that Zweig refers to this more than once, and it must be remembered that suicide had been Zweig's bedfellow long before his enduring exile. According to Friderike []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_32}in her biography, twice during their life together he had asked if she would die alongside him. His short stories often involve a suicide or a suicidal person, and the suicidal impulse occurs regularly in his non-fiction works, most disturbingly in the biographical portrait of Kleist. Here, Zweig seems to seize the opportunity of Kleist's suicidal state of mind to reveal his own morbid thoughts and, eerily, to prefigure the double suicide in Petrópolis:

::: {#9781782271468_introduction.html_extract7 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
Then from the silence a dark voice stirred, a voice which had touched him again and again, in moments of discouragement and despair: the thought of death. And as the youth forged his life plan, so his death plan was also thought out in advance... always in moments of impotence it emerged, surging powerfully upwards like a dark rock whenever the tide of passions and hopes in his soul ebbed.
:::

Zweig then goes on to describe the pact with the terminally ill Henriette Vogel, whom Kleist seduced into suicide and shot minutes before he turned the gun on himself. It must be left to the reader to judge whether what follows, considering the situation of Stefan and Lotte, is relevant:[]{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_33}

::: {#9781782271468_introduction.html_extract8 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
At the moment when his soul brimmed with bitterness and disgust, when his spirit was darkened, he encountered a woman, a stranger... who showed gratitude for this proposal of a special union. She was an invalid, marked for death, eaten away by cancer as Kleist was eaten away by the fatigue of life, and though herself incapable of making a forceful resolution, she was exalted by his passion and agreed to journey with him into the abyss.
:::

Despite the obvious differences in the dynamic of the relationship in these two fatal unions, it is hard not to find with hindsight an ominous presentiment in such passages. Although Lotte Altmann was not terminally ill, she was plagued by asthma, and despite all attempts to resolve this condition, she suffered greatly. Zweig mentions this in his final letters in an attempt to further justify their suicide.

When Zweig, on the eve of his death, respectfully returned to Feder the Montaigne volumes he had borrowed, he had underscored a line in the preface: "It is my opinion that you should lend yourself to others and give yourself only to yourself." Zweig implied here and elsewhere that he had done enough of the former and []{#9781782271468_introduction.html_pagebreak-rw_34}not enough of the latter. Furthermore, his existence in the winter of 1941--42 no longer seemed to be directed by himself. External forces had ultimately overrun his defences. He would therefore respectfully withdraw from the world, his artistic legacy to endure or fade at the discretion of posterity.

[T]{.dropcap}[HERE IS A SELECT GROUP]{.smallcaps} of writers who are accessible to anyone, at whatever age or stage of life---Homer, Shakespeare, Goethe, Balzac, Tolstoy---and then there are those whose significance is not properly revealed until a particular moment. Montaigne is one of these. In order to recognize his true worth, you should not be too young, too deprived of experience and life's deceptions, and it is precisely a generation like ours, cast by fate into the cataract of the world's turmoil, to whom the freedom and consistency of his thought conveys the most precious aid. Only he whose soul is in turmoil, forced to live in an epoch where war, violence and ideological tyranny threaten the life of every individual, and the most precious substance in that life, the freedom of the soul, can know how much courage, sincerity and resolve are required to remain faithful to his inner self in these times of the herd's rampancy. Only he knows that no task on earth is more burdensome and difficult than to maintain one's intellectual and moral independence []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_38}and preserve it unsullied through a mass cataclysm. Only once he has endured the necessary doubt and despair within himself can the individual play an exemplary role in standing firm amidst the world's pandemonium.

Only a seasoned man who has tested himself can appreciate the true worth of Montaigne, and I count myself one of them. When at the age of twenty I picked up a copy of the *Essais*, that incomparable book he left us, I must confess I had little idea what to do with it. Of course, I had enough literary discernment to realize that here was unveiled a compelling personality, a man with a peculiarly wide-ranging and lucid gaze, an endearing figure and, what's more, an artist who knew how to engrave his own signature on each phrase and each expression. But my pleasure remained solely literary, like that of a collector before a beautiful antique; it lacked the interior spark of passion, the electric arc which spans two kindred souls. In their subject matter the *Essais* seemed to me rather wayward and on the whole to deny any possibility of meeting my own soul. Of what relevance to me, a young man of the new twentieth century, were the effusive divagations of this Seigneur de Montaigne on 'La Cérémonie de l'entrevue des rois' or his 'Considérations sur Cicéron'? This Frenchman, []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_39}already yellowed by time and lost in the riddles of his Latin quotations, seemed so scholarly and anachronistic. And even his wisdom, so gentle and tempered, remained foreign to me. It had arrived prematurely. What would I have done then with the judicious counsel of Montaigne, who warned against sacrificing oneself to ambition and committing oneself too ardently to the exterior world? What meaning could his gentle and insistent call for temperance, for tolerance, have on a hot-headed youth who did not want to be dispirited, who did not care for his calming message, who, without even being aware, only aspired to be inflamed by the vital effusion of youthful enthusiasm? It is the business of youth to recoil from the counsel of gentleness, of scepticism. Doubt becomes an obstacle, for a youth has need of faith and ideals to give free rein to the impetuosity borne within. And even the most radical, the most absurd illusions, as long as they inflame, would in his eyes have more importance than the most profound wisdom, which saps the strength of his will.

And furthermore, this freedom, of which Montaigne was the uncontested herald: did one really need to defend it with such obstinacy, now, in 1900? Surely, for so long now, all that had been taken for granted---had been []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_40}humanity's rightful possession, freed from all tyranny and servitude, sealed by law and custom? It seemed obvious that the right to have our own lives, our own thoughts, to express them freely through the spoken and written word, belonged to us as much as the breath that left our mouths or the beating of our hearts. The world unfurled before us with its numberless countries; we were neither prisoners of the state, nor yoked to the service of war, nor arbitrarily submitted to tyrannical ideologies. It seemed to our generation that Montaigne was simply rattling chains we thought long since broken, and we could never imagine that in fact Fate had reforged them for us, far stronger and crueller than ever before. So then, we honoured, we respected his struggle for spiritual freedom like a historic battle, which seemed to us now superfluous and futile. For one of life's mysterious laws shows that we only notice the authentic and essential values when it's too late: youth, once it has fled, health at the moment it abandons us, freedom of the soul, that most precious essence, at the very moment when it is taken from us, or has already been taken.

It is crucial then that we strive to understand the art of living, the wise way of living according to Montaigne, and to realize that this struggle leads to the discovery []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_41}of "*soi-même*",[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-num-footnote-4)]{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-ref-footnote-4 .ref-footnote} the most crucial struggle of the spirit, exemplified by his own life. We too need to stand the test, to endure one of the most horrifying collapses of humanity, which follows directly one of its most magnificent periods of advancement. We too are to be torn from our hopes, from our experiences, our expectations and our enthusiasms, chased out from them as if under the whip, until we have only our naked selves left to defend, that unique being which is irreplaceable. It was only when destiny made us brothers that Montaigne granted me his aid, his consolation, his irreplaceable friendship; how indeed does his fate seem so very similar to our own! When Michel de Montaigne made his entry into the world, a great hope was beginning to die, the same hope that we experienced at the opening of our century: that of a more humanistic world. In the space of a single generation, the Renaissance had lavished on humanity a gift that enabled its artists, painters, thinkers, its seers and poets to reach a level of perfection none had anticipated. A century---no, centuries were opening up where creative power, step by step, wave on wave, was carrying dark and chaotic existence towards the threshold of the divine. All at once the world had become vaster, []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_42}richer. With Greek and Latin, the scholars rediscovered antiquity and gave back to mankind the wisdom of Plato and Aristotle. Under the guidance of Erasmus, humanism promised a unified and cosmopolitan culture; the Reformation seemed, alongside the new scope of knowledge, to have founded a new religious freedom. Distances, borders between peoples were beginning to dissolve, for printing, which had just been invented, gave to each word, to each thought, the means to soar, to spread; that which had once been the reserve of a single people seemed now open to all; a spirit of unity was emerging beyond the bloody quarrels of kings, princes and armies. And another miracle: just like the spiritual world the terrestrial world was expanding in dimensions no one could have conceived. Across an ocean thought impassable emerged new shores, new countries, a great uncharted continent, promising a safe haven for future generations. The arteries of commerce experienced ever livelier pulsations, a wave of riches extended across old Europe leaving luxury in its wake, and in its turn the luxury left buildings, paintings, statues---a highly decorated, spiritualized world. And always when there is more space, the soul opens up. So it was at the beginning of our own century, when, once []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_43}more, space increased in grandiose fashion thanks to the conquest of the ether by flight, thanks to physics, chemistry, technology. As science drew from nature her secrets one after another and revealed those secrets in the service of man, an inexpressible hope animated a humanity so often disappointed, and from a million souls arose Ulrich von Hutten's jubilant cry: "What joy it is to live!"

But always when the wave climbs too high and too quickly, it falls the more violently, like a cataract. And just as, in our time, the miracles of technology have morphed into the most horrific elements of destruction, so elements of the Renaissance and humanism which at first seemed to offer salvation proved a lethal poison. The Reformation, which dreamt of bringing to Europe a new Christian spirit, provoked unrestrained barbarism in the wars of religion; the printing press did not diffuse culture but *furor theologicus*;[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-num-footnote-5)]{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-ref-footnote-5 .ref-footnote} instead of humanism it was intolerance that spread. Across the whole of Europe, a murderous civil war devastated each country, while in the new world the bestial excesses of the conquistadors led to unparalleled cruelty. The century of Raphael and Michelangelo, of Dürer and []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_44}Erasmus, permitted the atrocities of Attila, Genghis Khan or Tamerlane.

How, in spite of its infallible clear-sightedness, in spite of the pity set deep in its soul, was humanity obliged to suffer this terrifying descent into bestiality, through one of those sporadic outbursts of insanity which sometimes seize it, just like that which we endure today? In this question lies the real tragedy of Montaigne. At no moment in his life did he see reign in his country, or the world at large, peace, reason or tolerance, all those higher spiritual forces to which he had devoted his inner calling. When he opens his eyes to look out on the world and then lowers his gaze, he turns aside, like us stricken with horror at this mob frenzy of fury and hate which debilitates and profanes his homeland and humanity. He is still virtually a child, no more than fifteen years old, when, before his eyes, the riots against the *gabelle*[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-num-footnote-6)]{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-ref-footnote-6 .ref-footnote} are ferociously repressed in Bordeaux, exhibiting an inhumanity which will leave him for the rest of his days the sworn enemy of all cruelty. The child witnesses how men in their hundreds are tortured to death, hanged, impaled, quartered, decapitated, burnt; he watches the crows, for days on end, wheeling around the gibbets, []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_45}feeding on the burnt, half-putrefied flesh of the victims. He hears the cries of the martyred and cannot escape that odour of burnt flesh wafting through the streets. Hardly has he left childhood behind when war breaks out, which, due to the fanaticism of the opposing forces, devastates France almost as completely as today socialist and nationalist violence brings devastation to all four corners of the world. The Chambre Ardente sends the Protestants to the stake, the St Bartholomew's Day massacre consumes 8,000 men in a single night. The Huguenots reply like for like: they assault the churches, destroy the statuary. Even the dead are not left in peace by the fanatical roaming bands: the tombs of Richard the Lionheart and William the Conqueror stand desecrated and pillaged. Troops of soldiers run from village to village, sometimes Catholics, sometimes Huguenots, but always Frenchman against Frenchman, citizen against citizen, each trying to outdo the other in ever more extreme acts of savage bestiality. Whole garrisons are exterminated, down to the last man, the rivers are corrupted with the corpses thronging them, thousands of villages are reported razed and pillaged, and soon the murder even dispenses with any religious pretext. Armed bands attack castles and travellers at will, not bothering []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_46}to distinguish between Protestant and Catholic. A ride on horseback through the neighbouring wood is no less dangerous than a journey to the West Indies or to the lands of the cannibals. No one knows any more if his house and possessions are still his, or if come the morrow he will be alive or dead, prisoner or free man, and at the end of his life, in 1588, an aged Montaigne writes:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_extract9 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
In this bedlam in which we have found ourselves for the last thirty years, every Frenchman, whether privately or in wider terms, may find himself at any given moment at a point where he suffers a complete reversal of his fortunes.
:::

Nothing is assured any more on this earth: this fundamental feeling is inescapably reflected through the spiritual intuition of Montaigne. One must seek another certitude beyond the world, beyond the homeland; one must refuse to join the chorus of the demoniacal and create one's own homeland, one's own world, outside the present time.

The poetic prose that La Boétie addresses in 1560 to his friend Montaigne, now twenty-seven years old, reveals the feeling, so tragically familiar to our own time, []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_47}of men who have somehow remained human and can still bear witness:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_extract10 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
What fate has in store for us in this hour! Beneath my gaze the country lies a wasteland, and I see no other course of action than exile, to abandon my house and go wherever fate decrees. For long now the fury of the gods has exhorted me to flee and reveals to me the vast and free lands across the ocean. When at the dawn of our century this new world emerged from the floods, it was as if the gods had marked it to be the refuge where men could freely cultivate their fields, under a virtuous sky, while the gruesome blade and the shameful pestilence condemned Europe to decline.
:::

In such epochs where the highest values of life---our peace, our independence, our basic rights, all that makes our existence more pure, more beautiful, all that justifies it---are sacrificed to the demon inhabiting a dozen fanatics and ideologues, all the problems of the man who fears for his humanity come down to the same question: how to remain free? How to preserve the incorruptible lucidity of my spirit faced with all the threats and dangers []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_48}of sectarian turmoil? How to keep humanity intact in the throes of bestiality? How to escape the tyrannical demands that the state and Church seek to impose on me? How to protect that unique part of my soul against enforced submission to rules and measures dictated from outside? How to safeguard the deepest region of my spirit and its matter which belongs to me alone, my body, my health, my thoughts, my feelings, from the danger of being sacrificed to the deranged prejudices of others, to serve interests which are not my own?

It is to this question and this question alone that Montaigne dedicated his life and his strength. It is for this love of liberty that he observes himself, watches over, experiences and criticizes every movement and every sensation. And this quest, which he undertakes to safeguard his soul, his liberty, at a moment of universal servility before ideologies and parties, makes him today a brother to us, more intimate than any other artist. If we love and honour him today more than any other, it is because he devoted himself more than any other to the most sublime art of living: "*rester soi-même*".[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-num-footnote-7)]{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-ref-footnote-7 .ref-footnote}

Other, less fraught epochs have concentrated on the literary, moral and psychological heritage of Montaigne, []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_49}learnedly debating so as to establish whether he was a sceptic or a Christian, an Epicurean or a Stoic, a philosopher or an entertainer, a writer or merely a dilettante of genius. His conceptions of education and religion were pored over and dissected in a raft of theses and doctorates. But all that seems relevant now and occupies my thoughts on Montaigne today is this: how, in a time so reminiscent of our own, did he liberate himself inwardly and how, in reading him, can we fortify ourselves by his example? In him I see the ancestor, the protector and the friend of each "*homme* *libre*" on earth, the most adept master at this new yet eternal science, the preserving of oneself above all other concerns. Few men on earth have ever fought with such faithfulness and tenacity to preserve their most intimate selves, their "essences", from all impurities, from all toxins left by the rank spume of an epoch's storm waves, and fewer still have managed to rescue from the time in which they lived, and for all time, their deepest selves.

This struggle that led Montaigne to safeguard his interior freedom, a struggle that in his case was surely more conscious and more determined than that of any other human being, had nothing heroic or sententious about it. It would be an injustice to include Montaigne []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_50}with that group of poets and thinkers who, armed only with the word, fought for the "*liberté* *de l'homme*". He has nothing of the forceful tirades or lofty outbursts of a Schiller or a Byron, nothing of the pugnacity of a Voltaire. He may have permitted himself a rueful smile at the idea of wanting to impose something as deeply personal as inner freedom on individuals, let alone on the masses, and he profoundly detested professional reformers, theoreticians and peddlers of ideology. He knew only too well the colossal task represented by this simple idea: to safeguard one's independence at the core of oneself. His fight limits itself to the defensive, to defend this most intimate bastion, which Goethe named the "citadel", where entry is forbidden to all other men. His tactic was to be as inconspicuous as possible, to attract the minimum of attention through outward appearance, to travel the world as if wearing a mask, to seek out only the path that would lead to himself.

Thus, Montaigne does not provide what one might term a biography. He never offended anyone, because he never pushed himself forward, never sought an audience or endorsement. Seen from the outside, he appeared to be a model citizen, a functionary, a married man, []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_51}a Catholic, a man who discreetly paid his dues to the world. For his entourage, he assumed the mask of self-effacement so as to bloom inside himself, wondering at the nuances, the play of different colours over his soul. He was at every moment disposed to lend, never to give. Always, whatever his mode of living, he kept for himself alone the most authentic and most subtle element of his being. He left the rest to prattle on, to move with the herd, to get borne aloft, to preach and parade; he left the world to follow its chaotic crazed paths and only concerned himself with one thing: to be rational within himself, to remain human in an inhuman time, to remain free in the vortex of pandemonium. He let them have their say, those who mockingly accused him of indifference, indecision and cowardice; he let others relish their surprise at seeing him relinquish his duties and honours. His nearest and dearest, who knew him best, never doubted the perseverance, the clearsightedness and the subtlety with which, in the shadow of public affairs, he applied himself to the sole aim to which he was committed: to live his own life, and not simply to live.

So, in appearing inactive, he had accomplished an unswerving task. By restraining himself and articulating []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_52}his will, he had retained within himself the human being *in nuce*,[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-num-footnote-8)]{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-ref-footnote-8 .ref-footnote} the pure and timeless human being. And while now the theological tracts and philosophic digressions of his century seem to us somewhat bizarre and anachronistic, he remains our contemporary; the man of today and of all time, and his struggle has remained the most present of all. A hundred times, page after page, I have the impression when I turn to Montaigne that *nostra res agitur*, the sense that here has been thought, with far more clarity than I could ever muster, all that occupies the most profound recesses of my soul at this moment. Here is a "you", in which my "I" is reflected, here the distance between one epoch and another is expunged. This is not a book I hold in my hands, this is not literature or philosophy, but a man to whom I am a brother, a man who counsels me, consoles me, a man whom I understand and who understands me. When I pick up the *Essais*, the printed paper dissolves in the half-light of the room. Someone breathes, someone lives in me, a stranger has approached me, and now he is no longer a stranger, but an intimate, a friend. Four centuries have gone up in smoke: it is not the Seigneur de Montaigne who is speaking to me, that "*gentilhomme* []{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_pagebreak-rw_53}*de* *la* *chambre*"[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-num-footnote-9)]{#9781782271468_chapter_01.html_rw-ref-footnote-9 .ref-footnote} of a now-vanished king of France, the chatelain of Périgord, who left behind the white folded ruff, the pointed hat, the sword, who withdrew from his neck the glorious chain of the Order of St Michael. This is not the mayor of Bordeaux who has visited me, nor even a writer. It is a friend who has come, to counsel and disclose himself. Sometimes his voice reveals an inexpressible melancholy which pierces the fragility of our human condition, the deficiency in our reason, the narrowness in the views of our leaders, the absurdity and base cruelty of our epoch, the noble sorrow that his follower Shakespeare knew how to articulate in such an unforgettable manner, through characters so dear to him: Hamlet, Brutus, Prospero. Soon, however, I glimpse again the smile: but why take all that pandemonium so seriously? Why let yourself be so torn and traumatized by the inanity and depravity of the epoch in which you are obliged to live? All of that can only graze your skin; it cannot reach the interior self. The outside world can take nothing from you and cannot unhinge you, as long as you do not allow yourself to be disturbed. The events of your time remain impotent before you, as long as you refuse to take part in them, and the madness of the epoch does not constitute a real danger, as long as you conserve in yourself a purity of spirit. And even the most dispiriting of your affairs, the seeming humiliations, the blows of fate: you only feel them if you show weakness before them, for who, other than you, assigns to things value and weight, joy and pain? Nothing can lower or raise your self from outside; that which remains inwardly free and sincere easily defeats the strongest pressure from the exterior. Always, and more so when the peace of the soul and the liberty of the individual are threatened, the word and the wise encouragement of Montaigne are a godsend, for nothing protects us more than sincerity and humanity in times of confusion and disunity. At any given moment, what he uttered centuries ago remains valuable and true for those who strive for independence. More than ever, we owe our knowledge to the ones who reinforce in us the sense of being human in an inhuman epoch like ours, those who exhort us not to abandon what is ours by right, what we cannot imagine losing, our deepest selves. Only the man who remains free from all and everything augments and sustains freedom on this earth.

[T]{.dropcap}[HE WRITER OF THE]{.smallcaps} *Essais* signs himself with the proud title of Michel, Seigneur de Montaigne, and bestows on himself an aristocratic coat of arms at the modest cost of 900 francs. For such a sum his great-grandfather had purchased the chateau of Montaigne from the bishops of Bordeaux on 10th October 1477, but because his grandson, Montaigne's father, had not obtained authorization to add his name to that of the property, Michel's middle-class ancestors were called simply by the name Eyquem. Only Michel de Montaigne, the sceptical and intelligent connoisseur of the world, knew the importance of having a name which rang clear: "Having a beautiful name, which one pronounces and recalls with ease." So, at his father's death, he did away with all the parchments and old documents referring to the family name. It is owing to this quirk of history that we now search through world literature for the name of the author of the *Essais* not under E for Eyquem, but under M for Montaigne.

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_pagebreak-rw_56}For centuries, in Bordeaux, the name Eyquem meant gold and money, and doubtless too gave off a faint whiff of smoked fish. But from where did they originate, these Eyquems of Bordeaux? From England, where Montaigne---whom we must always treat with circumspection regarding his heritage---alleges to have found "credible traces of family relations" within a "reputable household"? Or were they simply from the immediate environs of Bordeaux? Genealogical research has so far failed to establish anything conclusive. The only verifiable fact is that for centuries the Eyquems plied their trade on the waterfront of rue de La Rousselle, from a commercial stall where, as petit bourgeois brokers, they sold smoked fish, wine and other comestibles.

With Ramon Eyquem, the great-grandfather of Montaigne, born in 1402 in Blanquefort en Médoc, the family begins its rise out of the fish trade and simple storekeeping: they become shipowners and, owing to their prudent and wily disposition and thanks to a marriage with the richest heiress of Bordeaux, the foundations of the family fortune are laid. It is in his seventy-fifth year that Ramon Eyquem makes his most judicious acquisition, acquiring from his overlord, the archbishop of Bordeaux, that "*maison* *noble*", the chateau []{#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_pagebreak-rw_57}of Montaigne. The possession of an aristocratic chateau by a mere merchant constituted a solemn act, according to official ceremony. The old merchant enters the deserted chateau alone by the main doorway, which will be locked and barred behind him until his servants, his sharecroppers, his farmers and peasants have sworn an oath and paid homage to the new master. His son Grimon Eyquem is of a more modest ambition: he is content to enjoy the paternal heritage. He amasses a fortune, but leaves the old chateau semi-abandoned, indifferent to its future. It is only the grandson of Ramon Eyquem, the father of our Montaigne, Pierre Eyquem, who makes the decisive break in the gradual evolution from bourgeoisie to nobility. He bids farewell to the fleet of boats and the fish trade, opting for the far nobler activity of soldiering. As a young man, he accompanies King François I in the Italian war, where he keeps a journal---regrettably lost to us---expressing his most ardent desire that, in exchange for his loyal service, he might acquire the title of Seigneur de Montaigne. The new nobleman earns the prize of which his grandfather had once guardedly dreamt: he transforms the old chateau, virtually a ruin, into an imposing lordly seat. At the heart of a vast domain that this energetic []{#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_pagebreak-rw_58}and robust man had acquired plot by plot through innumerable law suits and a sole purchase, the stately castle rose up with its sturdy towers and fortified walls. From the outside it is a fortress, but this is also a house where the concepts of humanism are practised and where a generous hospitality is displayed. The young soldier, who has seen Italy and the Renaissance in its most sublime artistic flowering, draws lessons from his experience, and seeks to enrich his culture. What was, for his ancestors, mere lust for gain and cupidity, for him becomes a higher spiritual ideal. He obtains the first volumes of a magnificent library; he attracts learned men to his house, humanists and professors. Without neglecting the administration of his vast fortune and expanding domain, he considers that his noble obligation as an aristocrat is to serve his country in times of peace, in the same way he serves his king in times of war. After having first held the posts of *prévôt[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_rw-num-footnote-10)]{#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_rw-ref-footnote-10 .ref-footnote}* and *jurat*,[[†](#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_rw-num-footnote-11)]{#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_rw-ref-footnote-11 .ref-footnote} in other words, committee member on the municipal council, he ends up becoming vice mayor, then mayor of Bordeaux, where his devotion to his office results in the official honouring of his memory. Montaigne []{#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_pagebreak-rw_59}paints in moving terms the self-sacrifice of an already sick and exhausted man:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_extract11 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
I remember him in his dotage, during my childhood, that soul so cruelly afflicted by the plague of public disputes, the once gentle atmosphere of his house consigned to the past. Perhaps the infirmity of his years also had something to do with keeping him sequestered there. His existence was troubled, both domestically and health-wise, and it cannot be doubted that he despised his life, even as he sensed it slipping away. Yet he embarked on long and burdensome journeys purely for the good of the city. Such was his character. Furthermore he managed to achieve all this with a naturally bounteous goodwill: there was never a soul more benevolent and beloved.
:::

With Montaigne's father comes the second and penultimate stage in the family's ascension. From minor merchants solely preoccupied with creating wealth and enriching their family, the Eyquems become the leading citizens of the city and the lords of Montaigne. In all Périgord and the Guyenne, their name is accorded []{#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_pagebreak-rw_60}respect. But it is only the son who will seal the rise, only he who will be the instructor of Shakespeare, counsellor to kings, the glory of his language, the patron saint of all thinkers on this earth.

So over three generations, from Ramon to Pierre Eyquem by way of Grimon, the paternal family makes its ascent, fulfils its ambitions at the same steady rhythm, and the family of Montaigne's mother pursues its own path with comparable fortitude and farsightedness. When, in his thirty-third year, Pierre, Seigneur de Montaigne, father of Michel, takes the demoiselle Antoinette de Louppes de Villeneuve for his wife, it seems at a glance that old nobility is marrying into old nobility. But when one studies the marriage tract in ancient parchments, in annotations in the archives, one discovers that in fact the nobility of the Louppes de Villeneuve is as new as that of Montaigne and that, in the words of Casanova, it was selected from the alphabet with the same randomness as that of Eyquem. At the very moment when the fish merchant Ramon Eyquem, around a century before the birth of Montaigne, extricates himself from a bourgeois milieu deprived of social prestige to make that first step []{#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_pagebreak-rw_61}on the climb towards the aristocracy, a wealthy Spanish Jew from Saragossa, Mosche Paçagon, makes an equal first step to wrest himself from his ostracized community by being baptized. As sensitive as the Eyquems about revealing to his children and neighbours his true origins, he exchanges his ancient Jewish name for one with Spanish and aristocratic overtones. After the baptism he calls himself Garcia Lopez de Villanuova. The various branches of the family undergo their fate at the hands of the Spanish Inquisition. A number of these new Christians make the transition successfully. They become advisors and bankers for the courts; others, less cunning or without connections, were burnt at the stake, like the Marranos. But the most prudent of them leave Spain at the right moment, before the Inquisition gets too close to placing their noble Christianity under the magnifying glass. A part of the Lopez de Villanuova clan emigrates to Antwerp and becomes Protestant. Another, Catholic branch settles in Bordeaux and Toulouse, where the family takes French citizenship and, as a second camouflage of its origins, calls itself Louppes de Villeneuve. The Villeneuves and the Montaignes, or rather the Paçagons and the Eyquems, enter into a range of business ventures together. The last of these, and the most []{#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_pagebreak-rw_62}propitious for the world, is settled on 15th January 1528 with the marriage of Pierre Eyquem and Antoinette de Louppes, bringing a fortune of a thousand gold crowns. And you get some sense of the colossal wealth of the Eyquems of that period when later Michel de Montaigne describes this dowry as relatively modest.

To this mother of Jewish blood, with whom he lives in the same house for over half a century, and who will survive even her illustrious son, Montaigne apportions not a single word in his writings. We know nothing of her, apart from the fact that until the death of her husband, to whom she had borne five children, she managed the noble house with a formidable "*prudhommie*",[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_rw-num-footnote-12)]{#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_rw-ref-footnote-12 .ref-footnote} so much so that she could write in her will: "It is common knowledge that I worked for forty years in the Montaigne household alongside my husband in such a way that, through my labour, care and domestic example, the aforesaid house has been greatly improved and enriched." That is all that we know of her, and this absence of the mother throughout the *oeuvre* is often attributed to Montaigne's desire to veil and conceal his Jewish origins. Despite all his sagacity, Montaigne suffered something of an unsavoury infatuation with the nobility, which is why, []{#9781782271468_chapter_02.html_pagebreak-rw_63}no doubt, in his will he asks to be buried "in the tomb of my ancestors", when in truth only his father was ever buried at Montaigne. But even more so than in the case of his mother, Montaigne refrained---save for a sole dedication---from any mention of his wife or sister. His image of the world was forged according to the antique model, where the wife bears no relation to the spiritual world. And this is why we know nothing of any specific inclination or specific aversion of the Eyquem grandson for the granddaughter of Mosche Paçagon. These then are the two robust and vigorous currents which achieve their consummation in Montaigne but are then exhausted, there at the summit of the pyramid. In him, any tension between the Gascon fish merchants and the Jewish brokers is resolved in a new, unique and creative form. It is difficult to distinguish one line from another, leading into this wholly admirable consummation. We can only say that, through this union, he was predestined to become a man of honourable bearing, of harmony, a man who hears both sides, who does not prejudge, who shows not the least narrowness of spirit, an open mind inclined to tolerance, a "*libre-penseur*", a "*citoyen* *du* *monde*", not a son and citizen of a race or a fixed place, but a citizen of the world, beyond any land or time.

[A]{.dropcap}[NOBLE NAME HARBOURS]{.smallcaps} the unconscious will for its preservation and perpetuation across the generations. And so the first bearer of the title of Seigneur de Montaigne, Pierre Eyquem de Montaigne, could pride himself, on the last day of February 1533, on becoming ancestor to a family destined for future renown, when, following the death of two girls at a young age, the long awaited son was born, our Michel de Montaigne. From the hour of his birth, the father aspires to the highest of destinies for his son. In the same way that Pierre's education, intellectual refinement and social standing have overtaken his own father, so this son will in turn overtake him. In an isolated chateau in Gascony, in the middle of the sixteenth century, 250 years before Jean-Jacques Rousseau and three centuries before Pestalozzi, an old soldier, grandson of a fish merchant, ponders lengthily over the education he will give his son. He seeks the counsel of his erudite humanist friends and deliberates with them over the []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_65}best methods of raising his son, right from his earliest childhood, to a higher level in the human and social dimension; this solicitude, which is wholly uncharacteristic of the epoch, presents a number of analogies with modern conceptions. Montaigne's beginnings are in themselves astonishing. The child is very quickly torn from the maternal breast and, instead of employing a nursemaid, as was the custom in aristocratic houses, they put him at a distance from the chateau of Montaigne and place him with people of a humble position, poor woodcutters in a small hamlet within the fiefdom of Montaigne. In doing this, the father not only wants to accustom the child to "austerity and frugality", in order to strengthen him, he wants to "bond him to the people from the outset and for him to experience the situation of those who have need of our assistance", expressing a notion of egalitarian nurturing that seems almost inconceivable given the period. Perhaps Pierre Eyquem, bourgeois before nobleman, had been forced to endure the arrogance of the privileged class. Also he wanted to prevent his son picking up from early childhood the sense of being "top brass", a member of an entitled elite; on the contrary, he would quickly learn to "turn to those who lend us an arm, rather than those who []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_66}turn their back". Physically, Montaigne seems to have stood the test of frugality and the spartan upbringing in the wretched hut of the charcoal-burner, and he reports that he was so accustomed to a rudimentary diet during childhood that he always prefers simple fare and, in place of sugary things, jams and biscuits, "brown bread, lard and milk". For the rest of his life, Montaigne remained grateful to his father for having freed him from prejudice in his most tender years, and while Balzac, until his death, reproached his mother for having abandoned him in the house of a gendarme until the age of four, instead of keeping him, Montaigne would approve wholeheartedly of the happy experience, promising: "If ever I have a male child, I would hope that he shall of his own volition accept a similar fate."

The transformation is radical when, after three years, the father restores the boy to the chateau of Montaigne. Following the counsel of his learned friends, once the body is bolstered the soul must be made supple. Plucked from the plebeian milieu, as if from hot to cold, the young Michel is suddenly plunged into the world of humanism. From the very start, the ambitious Pierre Eyquem decided that his son would not be an indolent gentleman idling away his time in the frivolous pursuits []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_67}of dice, wine and hunting, nor would he be a merchant or money-grubber. Rather he must be solely concerned with the highest spheres, must be of that minority who, through their sagacity and their culture, direct the destiny of their epoch through the counsel of kings and influence events by their word, those whose homeland is not the narrow provinces, but the vast horizons of the world. But, in the century of humanism, the key to this spiritual empire was Latin, and so Montaigne's father decided to place this magic instrument in the hand of his son at the earliest opportunity. In the secluded chateau of Périgord, then, the most curious spectacle occurs, not without a certain air of comedy. At considerable cost, the father hires a German scholar, chosen deliberately since he knows not a word of French, plus two no less scholarly assistants, who are forbidden to address the child in any language bar Latin. The words and phrases that the four-year-old learns are in Latin and, to ensure that he does not absorb French, his mother tongue, at the same time, and so as to retain the purity and perfection of the Latin, they draw an invisible ring around little Michel. When the father, the mother or the servants want to say something to the child, they must first acquire for themselves a few snatches of Latin []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_68}from the masters. And in the chateau of Montaigne, a truly comic situation emerges: due to a pedagogic experiment, an entire household, relatives and staff, are obliged to learn Latin for the benefit of an infant four years old! A happy outcome of this was that a few isolated words and Latin Christian names trickled into the surrounding villages.

As ever, the required result seemed to be achieved with ease; certainly, by the age of six, the future master of French prose could not pronounce a single word in his mother tongue, but without books, without grammar, without coercion of any kind, without the threat of the cane or any tears, he learnt to speak Latin in the purest and most faultless manner. The ancient universal language is his original native tongue, so much so that, for his whole life, he will always take more pleasure in reading Latin than French. And in a moment of fright or in a sudden exclamation, it is the Latin and not the French word on his lips. If Montaigne in his mature years had not already found himself facing the decline of humanism, it seems feasible that his works, like those of Erasmus, would have been written uniquely in this assumed language, and the French would have lost one of their greatest writers.

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_69}But this method, which meant teaching Latin to his son without a book, without serious effort and in a sense by way of a game, is only one of the manifestations of the paternal will, carefully deliberated, to educate the child with the minimum of suffering. In contrast to the brutal schooling favoured at the time, where strict principles are hammered home under the blows of the cane, here the child was to develop according to his own inward predilections. The humanist advisors expressly stated to this concerned father the need, as Montaigne later writes, "to allow me to savour science and duty through free will and my own desire; to raise my soul in gentleness and liberty, without rigidity and any unnatural constriction".

A diverting detail reveals how far they went in this deliberate concern to develop individual will, in that strange chateau in Périgord. Apparently, one of the private tutors claimed that what troubles the "tender brain of the child" is when he is "woken with a violent start" from sleep. So was invented a curious system to safeguard the nerves of the young child from this shock, however minimal. Each day in his little child's bed, Michel de Montaigne is woken by music. Around his bed, flautists and string players wait for the signal to commence the soft melody that will draw the sleeping []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_70}Michel from his dreams of yesterday, and this delicate task is followed with the most rigorous care. "At no time," recalled Montaigne, "was I deprived of this service." No child of the Bourbon kings, no scion of the Hapsburg dynasty was ever raised with so much care and attention as the grandson of a Gascon fish merchant and a Jewish money broker.

:::

This individualistic nurturing, which denies the child nothing and gives free rein to all his inclinations, was an experience not without dangers. For to be thus indulged, meeting no resistance, not submitting to any form of discipline, courts the possibility of developing caprices and all manner of wayward inner desires. And Montaigne would later recognize that it was only down to happy chance that his gentle and laissez-faire upbringing had in his case brought about a positive effect: "If things have gone well for me, then I would say that is to some extent fortuitous and came about by itself. Had I experienced a less rigorous system of education, I fear my fate would have been wretched."

Certain traces of this upbringing, the best and the worst, remained visible in Montaigne for the rest of []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_71}his life. It was evident in the stubborn refusal to submit to any authority, to bend before any discipline, which ultimately caused a certain atrophy of the will. This peculiar childhood gave Montaigne, for all the years to come, the unfortunate habit of evading as much as possible any overly insistent or powerful tension, all that was problematic, routine or an obligation, and of always giving in to his own desire, to his own caprice. This "mercurialness", this "insouciance" which he laments so often, perhaps have their origin in these formative years, but so too does his obstinate will to remain unfettered, never to be the slave of one opinion or another. It is due to the generous solicitude of his father that later he is able to cry proudly: "I have a completely self-contained soul, accustomed to directing itself in its own way." He who as a blameless child has known the exquisite delight and benefits of freedom will never forget these things and will never lose them.

This indulgent education of a spoilt child provides a fortunate opportunity for the peculiar blossoming of Montaigne's soul. But it's also lucky for him that it comes to an end before it is too late. To appreciate freedom, []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_72}one must have known constraint, and the chance falls into Montaigne's lap when, at the age of six, he is sent to the college of Bordeaux, where he will remain until his thirteenth year. Not that this son of the wealthiest citizen and mayor of the city is exactly treated with any firmness or harshness: the one and only time he receives the rod, it is administered "very gently". But all the same he encounters a strict discipline which arbitrarily imposes its opinions on the pupil without caring to ask of his own. For the first time, he must apply himself to regular lessons, and accustomed as he is to going his own way, his childhood instincts unconsciously rebel against rigid forms and all ready-made knowledge presented to him. "They never cease whining into our ears," he gripes, "as if it were being poured into a funnel, and our task is merely to parrot back everything we have been told." Instead of allowing his own thoughts to ripen in his mind, the masters fill it with a petrified knowledge and leave it "bereft of insight and consciousness". And he angrily contests: "What use is it to have a bellyful of meat, if one cannot digest it, if it cannot transform us, if it cannot improve us and fortify us?" He is irritated to find that the schoolmasters make him learn by rote facts and figures, laws and systems---it's not without reason that []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_73}in this period his schoolmasters were labelled pompous prigs---and that they wanted to impose on him a "bookish opaqueness". He is indignant that the masters judge the star pupil to be the one best able to learn by heart. It is precisely this surfeit of erudite knowledge which disables any capacity to evolve an independent view on the world: "As when plants suffocate for too much moisture, and lamps from too much oil, so the action of the spirit is suffocated by an overload of study and matter." Such knowledge is a burden on the mind, not an action of the soul: "To know by heart is not to know, it is to keep what they have given you and store it in your memory."

It matters little to know the date of the Battle of Cannae, to be able to read Livy and Plutarch, or to understand the characters of Scipio and Hannibal; it is not the cold fact which has meaning, but rather the human and emotional element contained within it. Therefore, later, the mature man will hand out a bad mark and a good lesson to those masters who only seek to inculcate rules mechanically: "our masters", he says in his last years,

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_extract12 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
should judge the aptitude of a child not by his memory but by the testimony of his life... Let the []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_74}young man read and sift and verify, not just accept the authority in good faith. A rich variety of opinions must be presented to him. He will make his choice, and if he cannot, then he will remain in doubt. He who sheep-like follows another follows nothing. He discovers nothing, because he seeks nothing.
:::

The good masters were incapable of furnishing the recalcitrant child with a liberal education, even though among them were to be found distinguished and even famous humanists. So, he was to take his leave of school without gratitude. He left it "lacking any yield that I might now draw on", he declared later.

If Montaigne was hardly satisfied with his masters, they were even more dissatisfied with their pupil. Not only did he have that interior resistance against all book knowledge, school knowledge, head knowledge from discipline and order, but a quick and malleable intelligence was found wanting in the young Montaigne---for as with so many eminent natures, in him spiritual intensity only manifested itself after puberty. This spirit, which later was so vigorous, so dextrous and so curious, remained during his years of adolescence the prisoner of a stupefying heaviness, a certain indolence which []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_75}seemed to weigh terminally upon him: "Although I was of robust health and well rounded, with a benign, accommodating nature, I was hampered by sluggishness, a drowsy and somnolent feeling, unable to wrest myself from slothfulness, not even when I was at play." Certainly, his tendency to cast a piercing gaze over things was already formed, but only, so to speak, in an embryonic and fleeting manner: "What I saw, I saw clearly, and beneath this sluggish facade, opinions and an audacious imagination were gestating at a level well above my age."

But these creative moments only had an inward effect. The masters were barely able to register it, and Montaigne did not blame them for having underestimated him; on the contrary, he is generous in criticism of his youth: "In me the spirit was slow to emerge, and could only move as far forward as it was led; my perception was delayed; my inventiveness dulled, and above all I suffered an incredible weakness of memory."

But no one suffers more at school than the gifted pupil in whom, in the sterility of its methods, the school knows neither how to cultivate nor bring to fruition the inner gift. And if Montaigne left this prison of his youth unscathed, it was only because he, like so many []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_76}others---Balzac so wonderfully describes this in his *Louis* *Lambert*---discovered that which, secretly, brings aid and consolation: the poetry book sitting next to the school book. Once, like Louis Lambert, he was won over to the enchantment of reading freely, he could not stop. The young Montaigne reads with great enthusiasm the *Metamorphoses* by Ovid, the *Aeneid* by Virgil, the dramas of Plautus in their original language, which is his true mother tongue. And this knowledge of the classics, together with his oral mastery of Latin, sets the record straight in unconventional fashion for this seemingly discredited and sluggish pupil. One of his masters, George Buchanan---who will later play a pivotal role in the history of Scotland---is also the author of highly esteemed Latin tragedies, in which Montaigne appears, as he does in school productions of other Latin dramas, with admirable success. He surpasses all his colleagues through the modulations of his voice and through his mastery of Latin, acquired so early in life. By the time he is thirteen, this ineducable pupil has already achieved his exterior education; from now on, and for the remainder of his life, Montaigne will be his own master and his own pupil.

Following school and college, it seems that the young man of thirteen years spent a period of relative repose []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_77}in the paternal home, before enrolling as a student of law at the university of Toulouse, or perhaps Paris. He himself insists that by the age of twenty his education is definitively at an end:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_extract13 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
It is my belief that by the age of twenty our souls are resigned to what they have become and they have achieved whatever they are able to... I am convinced that, after this age, my spirit and body have diminished rather than increased and retreated rather than advanced.
:::

No portrait of this young Montaigne, in which strength and crisp freshness are united, has come down to us. But he always describes himself with such care, with such evident relish and perspicacity, that we can be confident of his love for the truth and thus draw a satisfying image of his physiognomy. Montaigne was, like his father, surprisingly modest in stature, which he himself views as a deficiency and which he deplores, since this failure to meet the norm draws attention to him and diminishes his standing. But there is still enough to exhibit the proud allure of a young gentleman. A robust and healthy body, a finely chiselled face, narrowly oval-shaped, a delicate []{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_78}nose, with harmonious curves, a prominent brow, arched eyebrows, a full mouth set in the little chestnut beard, which seems to darken with some secret intent---such is the image Montaigne presents to the world. The eyes, striking through the power and keenness of their lustre, are yet to reveal the light melancholy noted in the later portraits. His temperament, though not exactly lively or joyful, was no less calm and composed. For chivalrous virtues, for sport and games, he lacks the agility and vitality of his father who, at sixty years old, can still leap over a table and in a storm mount the stairs of his chateau three at a time.

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_extract14 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
Of dexterity and skill, I am lacking... for music, singing, playing I have neither the voice, which has always been inept, nor the ability to master the instruments. In dance, ball games, wrestling, I have only learnt the basics; in swimming, fencing, racing and jumping, nothing at all. My fingers are so clumsy I can hardly read what I have written, or even fold the letter properly; I can barely manage to cut my quill, or saddle my horse, or fly a falcon from my hand, or handle dogs, birds and horses.
:::

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_03.html_pagebreak-rw_79}His soul is more drawn to sociability, and it is to this domain he devotes himself, always with an eye for the ladies, who, he confesses, deeply attracted him from the first. His lively imagination enables him to grapple quickly with all problems. Without being a dandyish figure---he observes, with that particular insouciance his character affords him, that he is one of those men on whose melancholy shoulders rich gowns may be draped---he seeks out the affairs and camaraderie of others. His true passion is discussion, but discussion as fencing foil, rather than through pugnacity or rage. The hot blood of the Gascon, which sometimes drives him to passionate outbursts, is watched over by the unclouded insight of a mind tempered by nature. Montaigne, who has a horror of all brutality, and who is nauseated by vulgarity, feels himself "physically tortured" at the first sight of suffering. The young Montaigne, before the stage of conceived and learned wisdom, can only draw on instinctive wisdom---to love life and his place in that life. Nothing in him is yet confirmed; no destination is in sight, there is no aspiration for contravention, no aptitude which lucidly or authoritatively announces itself. Irresolute, this young man of twenty surveys the world with inquisitive eye, to see what lies there and what he might bring to it.

[T]{.dropcap}[HE DEATH OF HIS FATHER]{.smallcaps} ( in 1568 proves a significant moment in Montaigne's life. For until then he has lived in the company of his father, his mother, his brothers and sisters and his spouse in this chateau which he emphatically names the "chateau of his ancestors", without the vexations of money, domestic concerns or the family business. The death of his father leaves him as sole heir, and a rich one at that. As the eldest son he is heir to the title, along with a private income of 10,000 livres, but also the onerous responsibility of the entire domain. His mother receives her dowry, and Montaigne, *major domus*, head of the clan, must apply himself to administering the daily accounts and the hundred and one petty demands of the estate, he who is so reluctant to take responsibility and is answerable to himself alone. And nothing aggrieves Montaigne more than a mundane occupation which demands a sense of duty, perseverance, tenacity, attention to detail---that is to say, []{#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_pagebreak-rw_81}highly methodical qualities. He openly admits his lack of interest in domestic affairs right into middle age. He who holds assets, possesses woods, pastures and vineyards unswervingly declares:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_extract15 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
I do not know the difference between one strain and another, whether in the field or in the granary, unless it is blindingly obvious; nor even between the cabbages and lettuces in my kitchen garden. I cannot name the most basic household tools, nor the most rudimentary principles of agriculture, things a child would know; not a month goes by when I am not caught out, having no idea that sourdough is used to make bread, or what actually happens when they stir the wine in the vat.
:::

And this new landowner is just as inept at managing his estate as he is with a garden spade or fork:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_extract16 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
I could never bring myself to read through contracts or arrangements destined for my scrutiny and subject to my care. In truth this was not so much a philosophical mistrust for the worldly, the mundane and transitory---no, rather it was unpardonable infantile []{#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_pagebreak-rw_82}idleness and gross negligence. I would rather do anything than read through a contract.
:::

For him the inheritance was most fortuitous; he cherished this nest egg only because it assured him an interior independence. But he would rather just enjoy it without worrying about it: "I would far rather the losses and dissensions in my business affairs remain hidden from me." Before his daughter is even out of the cradle, he dreams of a son-in-law to assume the burden of all these trials and labours. He would rather administer his domain as he contributes to political activity: from firm ground, on a casual basis when the mood takes him, steering with one hand and from a safe distance, without getting too deeply embroiled. He realizes that possession is an arbitrary gift which must be defended day by day, hour by hour: "I would have been quite content to descend into poverty, to exchange all this for a simpler life, one free from the relentless encroachment of business affairs."

In order to bear this weight of gold on his shoulders more easily, Montaigne decides to jettison a portion of it. His father's ambition has propelled him into public life. For some fifteen years, he has been assessor in the lower chamber of parliament but proceeded no further []{#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_pagebreak-rw_83}in his career. Now, with his father dead, he chances his destiny. Having been tenth assessor of the Chambre des Enquêtes, he seeks promotion to the higher chamber. But, on the 14th November 1569, the chamber snubs his overtures, arguing that his father-in-law is the president and his stepbrother one of the counsellors. This decision is a real blow, but in a higher sense proves fortuitous, for in it Montaigne finds a reason, a pretext, to bid farewell to public service. He resigns his post; or better still he sells it, and from this day on will only serve his city on his own terms, at variable times and when a particular task happens to draw his interest. It is difficult to attest if certain other more clandestine reasons concerning his private life did not also play a part in his withdrawal from public life. Montaigne often felt impelled to make an instant decision, though he hardly relished making it. The public atmosphere had once again become malignant. The Protestants were taking up arms and the St Bartholomew's Day massacre loomed. Like his friend La Boétie, Montaigne only conceived of his political activity as a medium for tolerance and conciliation. His nature placed him as the logical mediator between opposing factions, and his real action in public life had always centred around negotiating covert conciliations. []{#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_pagebreak-rw_84}But that time had now passed; he had to choose one way or the other. France must become Huguenot or Catholic. The coming years impose huge responsibilities around the fate of his homeland, and Montaigne is the sworn enemy of all responsibility. He strives to dodge decisions. Solitary sage in a time of mass fanaticism, he seeks seclusion and flight.

In his thirty-eighth year, Montaigne enters retirement. He no longer wishes to serve anyone but himself. He is weary of politics, of public life and business affairs. It is a moment of disillusion. In his social prestige, in his position in life, he is inferior to his father. He has been a worse civil servant, a worse husband, a worse custodian. What exactly is he then? He has the sense that up to this moment his life has been a sham; he yearns to live properly, to reflect deeply and ruminate. And it is among his books he hopes to find the solution to the eternal problem of "life and death".

And to cut himself off in some sense from any return to the world, he engraves this inscription in Latin on the wall of his library:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_extract17 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
In the year of Our Lord 1571, at the passing of his thirty-seventh year, on the eve of the month of[]{#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_pagebreak-rw_85}March, on this the anniversary of his birth, Michel de Montaigne, so long repelled by the servitude of his heart to public duties, feeling himself in robust health, comes to rest against the chaste breast of the Muses. Here, in calm and security, he will see out the declining days of a full life---in the hope that Fate will permit him this residence in the tranquil retreat of his fathers and dedicate it to his liberty, his repose and his leisure.
:::

For him this farewell must be more than just a farewell to duties. It is a rejection of the exterior world. Until now he has lived for others---now he wants to live for himself alone. Until now he has done what his occupation, the court, his father demanded of him, now he wants to do only what is pleasurable to the self. When he wanted to help, he achieved nothing; when he aspired to something, they barred his way; when he sought to counsel, they ignored his advice. He has amassed experiences, now he wants to establish their meaning and harvest their flowering. Michel de Montaigne has lived thirty-eight years on this earth; now Michel de Montaigne wants to know: "Who exactly is this Michel de Montaigne?"

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_pagebreak-rw_86}But even this retreat into his own house, into his private life, is not sufficient for Montaigne. Naturally, the house belongs to him by right and lineage, but in truth he feels the owner of so much more. There is his wife, his mother, his children, who do not hold much importance---in a rather odd passage, he even confesses to not knowing exactly how many of his children are dead---there are the servants, the farmers, the peasants, and he has to take all of them into account. The family does not always exist in a state of harmony; the house is filled with people and he craves solitude. All this domestic hubbub disgusts him, addles him, inconveniences him, and he thinks along the same lines as his idol La Boétie, adopting his premise: "La Boétie spent his whole life contemptuously scattering behind him the ashes of his hearth." Montaigne has not waived public service, for day after day the petty concerns common to any head of a family trickle in. He wants to give the emperor what is the emperor's right, but not a drop more. He wants to read, to think, to savour life; he does not want to be occupied with others, on the contrary, he wants to be occupied solely with himself. What Montaigne seeks is his interior self, that which cannot submit to state, to family, to time, to circumstances, to money, to property; []{#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_pagebreak-rw_87}this interior self, which Goethe labelled the "citadel", where all access is prohibited.

The path leading from public duty and into his house was only the first withdrawal; now he distances himself from family, demands of the estate, business affairs, in order to retire for good to his citadel.

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_blank-line5 .paras .blank-line .exclude-auto}
 
:::

This citadel, which for Goethe was only symbolic, Montaigne erects with real stones, a lock and a key. Today, it is difficult to imagine how the chateau of Montaigne must have once appeared, for it has experienced any number of reconstructions, and in 1882 a fire swept through the building, totally gutting it, with the happy exception of the "citadel", the famous tower of Montaigne.

When Michel de Montaigne takes possession of his house, he discovers a high tower, round and sturdy, which it seems his father had intended for defensive measures. On the ground floor is a tiny chapel, where a partly worn-away fresco shows St Michael vanquishing the dragon. A narrow spiral stairway leads to a round first-floor room and, because it is secluded, Montaigne chooses it as his sleeping quarters. But it is the next []{#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_pagebreak-rw_88}floor, until then "the most unavailing in my house", a storeroom of sorts, which becomes for him the most important. Here he creates a chamber for reflection. From here he can easily survey his chateau and fields. When the mood takes him he can observe what is going on and keep an eye on things. But no one can watch over him, no one can disturb his solitude. The room is large enough for him to walk up and down and from side to side, for Montaigne is only able to think properly when his body is in motion. Here he installs the library he has inherited from La Boétie, alongside his own. On the beams of the ceiling, he paints fifty-four Latin maxims, so that wherever his glance falls, it finds a sagacious and soothing word. Only the final one is in French, the famous "*Que-sais* *je*?"[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_rw-num-footnote-13)]{#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_rw-ref-footnote-13 .ref-footnote} To one side is a smaller chamber, used in the winter months, which he decorates with murals: these are covered over later, their content deemed too frivolous for the taste of later generations.

This solitude, surrounded by inscriptions, has a measure of the pompous and affected about it. One has the impression that Montaigne sought to impose rigidly on himself a discipline, the discipline of solitude. Since, unlike a hermit, he cannot abide any religious rules, he []{#9781782271468_chapter_04.html_pagebreak-rw_89}has to coerce himself into standing firm. Perhaps he is not aware, but it is an inward will that is forcing him on. This self-withdrawal is really a departure. Now he has ceased to live in the exterior world, a new life of inner creation can begin. It is here, in his tower, that Montaigne becomes Montaigne.

[GOETHE]{.style1}
:::

[O]{.dropcap}[VER THE NEXT DECADE]{.smallcaps} Michel de Montaigne spends the greater part of his time in this tower. When he mounts the first steps of the spiral stairway and leaves the discord and chatter of the house behind, he forgets the domestic affairs that so rankle with him. For: "I have that tender heart which is easily disturbed. When it is immersed in some occupation, the mere presence of a fly can annihilate it." When he glances out of the window he sees his garden, his farmyard and the occupants of his house. But around him, in the circular []{#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_pagebreak-rw_91}room, there is nothing but his books. He has the rich collection from La Boétie, and has added others of his own. It's not that he reads religiously all day long; just being aware of their presence brings contentment:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_extract18 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
For I take pleasure from the fact that I can enjoy them whenever it pleases me to do so; my soul is satisfied merely with possession. I never travel without books, neither in peace nor in war. Sometimes whole days go by, even months, without my looking at them. But it might be at any moment now, or tomorrow, or whenever the mood takes me... Books are, I find, the best provisions a man can take with him on life's journey.
:::

For him books are not like men, who impose themselves and burden him with their chatter, and of whom it is hard to be rid. When you don't call for them they stay put; you can just pick up this one or that, according to your whim: "Books are my kingdom. And here I seek to reign as absolute lord." Books offer him their opinion and he responds with his own. They express their thoughts and arouse in him further thoughts. They do not disturb him when he is silent; they only speak []{#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_pagebreak-rw_92}when he questions them. Here is his realm. They await his delectation.

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_blank-line6 .paras .blank-line .exclude-auto}
 
:::

How Montaigne reads and what he likes to read, he expresses incomparably. His relationship with books is like everything else, for here too he guards his freedom. With them too he knows no obligation to duty. He wants to read and learn, but only so far as he can savour the experience. As a young man he had read, he states "ostentatiously", merely to show off his knowledge; later, to acquire a measure of wisdom, and now only for pleasure, never to gain an advantage. If a book bores him, he opens another, if a book seems heavy going:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_extract19 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
I don't wear down my nails over some difficult passage in a book; I'll make one or two forays, then if that fails I'll give up. My mind is only really made for leapfrogging. What I don't make out at the first attempt, I strain to see through an even deeper murk at every renewed effort.
:::

The second the reading matter becomes too demanding, the casual reader should drop the book: "I do not need []{#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_pagebreak-rw_93}to sweat unnecessarily over them and I can discard them whenever it suits me to do so." He does not set himself up in his tower to be a learned scholar; he waits for books to coax him into rumination; they are intended to teach and encourage him through stimulation. He abhors all inflexible thought; all that seeks to impose on him a foreign opinion, a foreign knowledge. All that comes from the textbook nauseates him: "In general I select books which make use of science, not those which only lead back to it." He is without doubt a serendipitous reader, an amateur reader, but there has never been, in his time or in any other, a finer or more perceptive reader. Concerning Montaigne's judgement on books I am 100 per cent in accordance.

In the main, he has two predilections: he loves pure poetry, even though he has no gift for it himself, and concedes that his essays in Latin verse have been no more than pastiches of the last author he has read. He admires the art of the language, but is also very taken with the simplicity and charm of popular poetry. It is only that which lies between the two, that which is mere literature and not pure poetry, that leaves him cold.

If he adores works of the imagination, concrete facts also seduce him, and this is why history remains []{#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_pagebreak-rw_94}the great "game that lures him". And here, just as we do, he relishes extremes: "I esteem writers of history, whether the modest ones or those of the highest order." He has a passion for chroniclers like Froissart, who dig out the raw material of history, and then those "capable and distinguished" historians who, with a real gift for psychology, sift the true from the false out of this raw material---"But that is a privilege known only to the few." This is why, he says,

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_extract20 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
all those who write biographies provide the tastiest dishes for me. Since they attach more value to the motive than the event, it's more about what comes from within, rather than what happens on the outside. That's why Plutarch is my man, before all others.
:::

The others, "those who fall between two stools", those who are neither artists or naive, "they spoil everything, they want us just to chew the meat; they award themselves the right to judge, and they bend the facts of history to fit their own prejudices." He loves the world of images and symbols in poetry, the world of facts in prose, the highest art or the artless, the poet or the simple chronicler. As Verlaine rightly said, "And what remains is literature."

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_pagebreak-rw_95}The great lesson Montaigne receives from books is that reading, in its rich diversity, sharpens his faculty of judgement. It impels him to respond, to lend his own counsel. And this is why Montaigne tends to annotate his books, underlining passages and writing at the end the date on which he read them, or the impression that they made on him in that moment. This is not the art of the critic, nor even the art of the writer, it is merely a dialogue with pencil in hand; at the beginning he is far from any desire to set down anything coherent himself. But little by little the solitude of his room begins to act on him; the silent voices of the books demand a response ever more urgently, and, in order to master the run of his thoughts, he writes them down. This is how his casual reading morphs into an activity proper. He did not willingly seek it out---it found him.

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_extract21 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
When I retired to my house, I had decided, as far as was humanly possible in such matters, to ignore everything but spending what remained of my life in peace and sequestration. It seemed to me I could no better serve my spirit than by surrendering it to the savouring of its own thoughts. And I hoped that over time it would become more mature and []{#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_pagebreak-rw_96}compliant, so as to accomplish things with greater ease. But I find quite the reverse. Like a bolting horse, it had a hundred times more space to move in. In me arose a horde of fantastical chimeras and unearthly forms, all pell-mell on top of one another, without clear order or connection. To face this absurdity and strangeness with a cool head, I began to commit them to paper. I hoped that my spirit would soon become ashamed of itself. An intellect that does not have a fixed target is as good as lost. Whoever wants to be everywhere is nowhere. No wind blows for him who has no harbour.
:::

Thoughts track across his mind; he notes them without a sense of obligation, for the lord of the manor never dreams of committing these little efforts---essays---to print:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_extract22 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
When my thoughts are like patterns cut from cloth, sewn together without plan or strategy---I find myself obliged neither to take responsibility for them nor to keep to them. I can drop them if it suits me; I can return to my doubts and insecurity, and to my overriding form of thought: ignorance.
:::

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_pagebreak-rw_97}He does not exude the exactitude of the scholar, the originality of the writer, the sublime diction of the poet. He has nothing of the presumption of professional philosophers, of holding thoughts above all others. Furthermore, he has no scruples about adding here and there a phrase, which he has just picked up, from Cicero or Seneca: "For I must say through others what I cannot articulate so well, as much due to the feebleness of my language as that of my sense. I don't count my borrowings---I weigh them."

Intentionally, he omits the names of authors. But he admits it all willingly, for he is happy when he is stealing something, changing it, disguising it, turning it into something meaningful and new. He sees himself only as a "*réfléchisseur*",[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_rw-num-footnote-14)]{#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_rw-ref-footnote-14 .ref-footnote} not a writer, and he does not take too seriously what he scribbles down: "My aim is this, to pass the remainder of my life in an easeful state and not under the burden of labour, there is nothing I would break my head against in the name of scholarship."

In his aspiration for individual freedom, Montaigne repeatedly stresses that he is not a philosopher, nor a writer, nor an accomplished artist. What he says, what he quotes, should not serve as an example, an authority or a []{#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_pagebreak-rw_98}model: "When I read over them again, I care not for my notes. They displease me." If there were a law against all the inept and lazy scribes, as for beggars and wastrels, then he would have them banished from the kingdom, himself and a hundred others. He insists, not without a certain vanity, on the fact that he writes badly, that he is careless, that his grammar is poor, that he has a faulty memory and he is totally incapable of expressing what he really wishes to say: "I have put all my energies into being a writer of books. My sole purpose is there, my life's calling. It is my only occupation, my only mission."

:::

A non-writer, a distinguished lord who does not know how to fill his time, and who, for this reason, sometimes jots down a handful of his formless reflections: it is in this guise that Montaigne unremittingly portrays himself. And this portrait is fitting for the year when the *Essais* first appear in their early form. But one must also ask why the Seigneur de Montaigne decides, in 1580, to have printed in Bordeaux two volumes of these *Essais*. Without really being aware of it, Montaigne, in publishing his works, becomes a writer. The publication has made it so.

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_05.html_pagebreak-rw_99}The public is a mirror: each man discovers there another face when he knows he is being observed. Hardly have the first two volumes appeared than Montaigne begins de facto to write the next, and this time not only for himself. He starts amending the *Essais* to give them more punch; in 1588, a third volume is added to the first two and the famous Bordeaux copy, annotated in the first edition, demonstrates how he carefully polished each expression, modified the punctuation, right up to the day of his death. The later editions contain numerous additions. They are fairly bristling with quotations: Montaigne wants to show what he has read and places himself ever more at the centre of things. Unlike before, he is no longer concerned just with learning how to know: now the world must see who Montaigne is. He imbues his work with a continuing portrait of himself, drawn, save for a few details, with an admirable faithfulness.

But it is hard to deny that the first edition of the *Essais*, in which he writes less of himself, speaks the louder. Here we see the real Montaigne, Montaigne in his tower, the seeker of himself. There is a greater sense of freedom, more sincerity. But even the wisest cannot resist temptation; even the freest man has his bonds.

[M]{.dropcap}[ONTAIGNE]{.smallcaps}[ COMPLAINS]{.smallcaps} unwearyingly of his bad memory. He regards this---together with a certain idleness---as the real Achilles heel of his being. His faculty for perception, his discernment, is exceptional. What he sees, what he observes, what he recognizes, he does with the lightning eye of a falcon. But then he is too nonchalant, as he is ever reproaching himself, to order these discoveries in any systematic way, to expand on them in a logical sense, and, as soon as he grasps a thought, he loses it again, lets it drift away. He forgets the books he has read, has no memory for dates and misplaces the momentous events in his life. Like a river, all flows over him, leaving nothing behind: no deep conviction, no solid opinion, nothing fixed, nothing stable.

This weakness, which Montaigne endlessly bemoans, is in fact his strength. An inability to remain fixed at a certain point allows him always to go further. With him nothing is ever set in stone. He never stops at the boundary of past experiences; he does not rest on []{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_pagebreak-rw_101}his empiricism; he amasses no capital; before properly consuming them his spirit must acquire experiences over and again. So his life becomes an operation of perpetual renewal: "Unremittingly we begin our lives anew." The truths that he finds may in the coming months or even the coming years be truths no more. He must be forever searching. Thus is born a multitude of contradictions. Now he appears an Epicurean, now a Stoic, now a sceptic. He is at one and the same time all and nothing, always different and yet ever the same, the Montaigne of 1550, 1560, 1570, 1580, the Montaigne of yesterday.

Montaigne's greatest pleasure is in the search, not the discovery. He is not one of those philosophers who seek the philosopher's stone, the convenient formula. He cares not for dogma, precepts, and has a horror of definitive assertions: "Assert nothing audaciously, deny nothing frivolously." He has no defined destination. All roads are open to his "*pensée* *vagabonde*".[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_rw-num-footnote-15)]{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_rw-ref-footnote-15 .ref-footnote} He is only a philosopher in the manner of Socrates, whom he revered above all others because he left behind no dogma, no teachings, no law, no system, only an example: the man who seeks himself in all and who seeks all in himself.

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_pagebreak-rw_102}Perhaps we owe the best of Montaigne to this indefatigable searching instinct, to his passionate inquisitiveness, to his bad memory, and to the kind of writer he became. Montaigne is well aware that he forgets thoughts when he reads them in a book, and even those that a book induces in him. To retain his "*songes*",[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_rw-num-footnote-16)]{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_rw-ref-footnote-16 .ref-footnote} his "*rêveries*", which otherwise would drown him in wave after wave, he has only one means: to anchor them, note them in the margin or on the final page. But then, over time, the papers become confused, forming "an unconnected mosaic", as he refers to it. In the main these are jottings, points of reference, little more; only gradually does he attempt to create a link between them and a proper structure. He toils on, with the gnawing sense that he will not bring this task to any meaningful conclusion; most of the time he writes in short bursts, and this is no doubt why his phrases harbour a spontaneous quality.

But he is ever convinced that they fail to transmit truth. To write, to note down is for him only a by-product, a derivative---one is tempted to say, rather mischievously, that these writings are the sand in the urine, the pearl in the oyster. The raw material is life itself, of which there are only fragments and debris: "My métier, my art, is to live." []{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_pagebreak-rw_103}They are in some sense what photography is to a work of art, nothing more. The writer in him is only the shadow of the man, though so often we observe men whose art of writing is so great, but whose art of living is so modest.

He writes---but he is not a writer. Writing for him is only a substitute. The search for new words seems for him a "childish ambition". His phrases must resemble the spoken, the lived language; on paper they must be as limpid and unadorned as when they leave the mouth: succulent, vital and succinct, not mannered or affected. They must not be punctilious, "monkish", but rather "soldierly".

Because each of the *Essais* is distilled from a certain mood, from a reading, a conversation, an anecdote, they seem at first glance to be juxtaposed in a simple way, and this is how Montaigne conceived them. He never attempted to order them, to unify them. But gradually he begins to realize that these *Essais* have something in common, a bond, a centre, a direction. It is the point from which they depart and to which they return, that unchanging point: the self. At the beginning he appears to be chasing phantoms, or his own shadow across the wall; then, gradually, he becomes conscious that he is seeking something more defined: himself, that he is reflecting on his own life in all its forms, in order to live properly---but []{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_pagebreak-rw_104}for himself alone. What he first took for an idle caprice gradually reveals its implication. Whatever he describes really only expresses the reaction of his ego to this or that. The *Essais* are a single object which echoes his life: the "*moi*" or, better still, "*mon* *essence*".

He discovers he has a purpose, for "the soul which has no objective in sight, is one that is lost". He makes it his task to be wholly sincere with himself, and he notes this definition of wisdom which he finds in Pindar: "True being is the beginning of a great virtue." Barely has he unearthed this when the activity which he has until then been indulging as simple "amusement" takes on a new seriousness. He becomes an auto-psychologist. "What do I know?" he asks himself. Only three or four men have asked this question before him. He is fearful of the task he has set himself. Right away he realizes that it is not a simple matter to say what one is. He tries to observe himself from the outside, to see himself "as might another". He spies on himself, surveys himself, studies himself and becomes, as he later writes, "my own metaphysics, my own physics". He never ceases looking and claims that for years nothing has escaped his gaze: "Rare is the moment that evades or conceals itself from my scrutiny." He is no longer alone; he has a double. And he []{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_pagebreak-rw_105}discovers that this "amusement" is interminable, that his self constantly evolves, that he travels in waves "*ondulant*",[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_rw-num-footnote-17)]{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_rw-ref-footnote-17 .ref-footnote} that the Montaigne of today is quite different from the Montaigne of yesterday. He firmly concludes that one develops only in phases, in different states, in details.

But each detail has its significance; it's precisely the small, fleeting gesture that proves more vital than any inflexible attitude. He analyses himself, as it were, in slow motion. He breaks down the apparent unity into a sum of movements and transformations. In this way he never exhausts his own self; he remains on a perpetual quest. But in order to understand himself, he must do more than merely study himself. For you cannot know the world by just navel-gazing. This is why he reads history and studies philosophy: not to draw lessons and precepts, but to understand how other men have acted in the past, so that he can compare his own situation with theirs.

He explores "the rich souls of times past" to correlate them with his own. He studies virtues, vices, flaws and merits, the wisdom and puerility of others. History is his great instruction manual, for, as he says, it is in his actions that man reveals himself.

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_pagebreak-rw_106}So it is not only the "I", the self, that Montaigne seeks, but at the same time the human. He lucidly pinpoints what in each man is common to all and what is unique: personality, "*essence*", a complex mixture incomparable to all others, already fully formed by the age of twenty. And alongside runs the common human element, where each of these limited frail beings resembles the other, obligated to mighty laws, trapped in the span between birth and death. He searches then on two distinct paths. He seeks the I, the unique self, specifically the Montaigne self, which he does not feel is particularly exceptional or of great interest but which nevertheless remains incomparable and which he wishes to preserve for the world. Then he seeks the I in all of "us", the self that manifests itself in its own peculiar way, and determines how it fits into the other, the common one.

As Goethe seeks the original plant, Montaigne seeks the original man, the complete man, the pure form in which nothing is fixed, which is not sullied by prejudice and advantage, mores and laws. It's not by chance that he is fascinated by the Brazilian tribespeople whom he encounters in Rouen, who recognize no God, no leader, no religion, no conventions or morality. In them he sees the image of undisguised, uncorrupted man; the virgin []{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_pagebreak-rw_107}page on the one hand and then the unique script each man might engrave upon it, immortalized for eternity. What Goethe says in his 'Urworte' on personality, Montaigne could quite justifiably echo:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_extract23 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
*The day when you were given to the world,*

*At a given order the planets hailed the sun,*

*And right away you ceased to believe*

*According to that law which governed your apparition.*

*You can be no other, cannot escape from yourself,*

*That's what the sibyls have said, the prophets,*

*And neither time nor any force can break*

*The shaped strength which living evolves within.*
:::

It is the seeking of the self, this exploration which always departs from the self and returns to it, that some have registered as Montaigne's egoism, and Pascal in particular saw this as pride, conceitedness and even a sin, the primordial flaw. But Montaigne's stance does not mean that he turned away from others, that he showed himself an exhibitionist like Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Nothing was more foreign to him than self-conceit, or indulging in exalted self-aggrandizement. He was no solitary, no recluse, his search was not to exhibit himself, to flaunt []{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_pagebreak-rw_108}himself. When he says that he analyses unremittingly, he also makes it clear that he recalibrates himself unremittingly. He acts according to the will of his nature. And when he is wrong he is prepared to admit it. If it is true that such self-regard harbours arrogance, then this trait should not be denied, because he is in rightful possession of it, even though it might be "unhealthy": "I must not attempt to conceal such errors, for they are not in my case just a trend, they are my profession." More than any pride, for him this self regard is a natural function, rather an inclination than an affectation, and more than this a genuine pleasure. Wilful scrutiny of himself does not, however, leave him a stranger to the world. He is neither Diogenes, who hides in his urn, nor Rousseau, who entrenches himself in the monomaniac madness of persecution. It does not embitter him, nor does he distance himself from the world he loves: "I love life and make use of it in the manner it pleases God to have bestowed it." The cultivation of himself does not make him more solitary; on the contrary it brings him a glut of friends. He who paints his own life, lives for every man, he who expresses his time, does so for all times.

It is true: Montaigne achieved little else in his life aside from posing the question: "How should I live?" []{#9781782271468_chapter_06.html_pagebreak-rw_109}But what is so magnificent, so philanthropic in his case, is that when he posed this question: "How should I live?" he did not insist on following it up with: "This is how you should live!" The man who had engraved on a medallion the chosen maxim "*Que* *sais-je*?" had always detested fixed assertions. He had never sought to counsel others on anything he did not know intimately himself. "This is not my doctrine; it is my study, and no one else's lesson but my own." If someone wants to draw advantage from this, then he has no objection. As he says, his folly and error can hardly damage anyone else. "If I make a fool of myself then it's at my own expense and cannot prejudice others, because it is a folly that abides within me and cannot be followed."

What he sought, he sought for himself. What he found rings true for each as much as he cares to accept it, or is in a position to do so. The true essence of freedom is that it can never restrict the freedom of another.

DEFENCE OF THE CITADEL
:::

[I]{.dropcap}[N ALL THE WORKS]{.smallcaps} of Montaigne, I have found only one overriding theme, one emphatic affirmation: "*La plus grande chose du monde c'est de savoir être à soi*."[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_rw-num-footnote-18)]{#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_rw-ref-footnote-18 .ref-footnote} Neither position in the world, the privilege of blood nor talent makes for the nobility of man, but solely the degree to which he strives to preserve his personality and to live his own life. That is why for Montaigne the dialogue with the self is the highest level of art to be attained: "In the freedom of the arts, let us begin with the one which makes us free." And nobody practised it better than Montaigne. At first glance this might seem a rather impoverished aspiration, for nothing, one imagines, would be more natural for a man than to incline towards his own self, to lead a life "following his own natural disposition". But in truth, when one properly considers it, what could be more difficult?

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_pagebreak-rw_111}To be free, a man must feel no obligation or connection to anything, and yet we are all connected to the state, the community, the family; our thoughts are subject to the language we speak, making the isolated man, the absolutely free man, a phantom. It is impossible to live in a void. Consciously or unconsciously, our education renders us slaves to morals, religion and a perceived vision of the world; our breath is the air of the epoch in which we live.

To free oneself from all of that is inconceivable. Montaigne knew this all too well, he who during his life had fulfilled his duties to the state, to family, to society, who remained, at least on the exterior, faithful to religion and regularly submitted to the required devotions. Montaigne sought, for himself, nothing less than to find the farthest reach. We do not have to give to ourselves, we only have to "lend". We must "conserve the freedom of our soul and not mortgage it, except on those rare occasions when we deem it the right path". We do not need to cut ourselves off from the world, to wall ourselves up in a cell. But we need to make a distinction: we can love this or that, but we cannot "form a marriage bond" unless it is with our own selves. Montaigne does not reject everything we owe to passions or lust. On the []{#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_pagebreak-rw_112}contrary, he always advises us to take pleasure as far as is possible, for he is the earthbound man who accepts no limits: whoever has a passion for politics must involve himself with politics; whoever loves books must read books; whoever loves to hunt must hunt; whoever loves his house, his soil, his lands, his money, whoever loves things must devote himself to them entirely. But the most crucial is this: you should take as much as brings you pleasure, but not just to acquire things: "In the home, at study, hunting and all other forms of activity, one should strive for the fullness, the limits of enjoyment, but not exceed them, for then suffering begins to encroach." One must not allow oneself to be impelled by a sense of duty, overriding passion or naked ambition, to go beyond one's natural capacity; one should endlessly weigh the genuine value of things and not overestimate them; one should stop when the enjoyment stops. One should safeguard a clear-sighted mind, not become confined but always remain free.

But Montaigne does not issue explicit instructions. He only gives an example, his own: how hard he tries to liberate himself from all that pins him down, hampers, disturbs, restricts his freedom of movement. One might be tempted to draw up a list:[]{#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_pagebreak-rw_113}

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_general1 .block .general .exclude-auto}
To be free of vanity or pride, these perhaps the gravest of all indulgences.

To guard oneself from presumption.

To free oneself from fear and hope, belief and superstition. To be free of convictions and parties.

To be free of customs: "Custom clouds the true face of things".

To free oneself of ambitions and all forms of avarice: "Thirst for glory is the most futile of all, the most valueless and bogus currency known to man."

To be free of family and familiar surroundings.

To be free of fanaticism: "Each country imagines it alone has the perfect religion." To be free of possessiveness, the urge to stand at the summit of all things. To stand free before Fate. We are her masters. We lend things their colour and expression.
:::

And the last freedom: in the face of death. Life hangs on the will of others, but death on our own will: "*La plus volontaire mort c'est la plus belle*."[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_rw-num-footnote-19)]{#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_rw-ref-footnote-19 .ref-footnote}

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_pagebreak-rw_114}The man who detaches himself from everything, who is connected to nothing, who doubts all, and exists in the void: this is how Pascal paints Montaigne. Nothing could be more erroneous: Montaigne loved life inestimably. The one and only fear that he countenanced was of death. He loved everything about life, however it came: "There is nothing useless in nature, not even uselessness itself; nothing in this universe exists without having a specific place reserved for it." He loves ugliness, for it makes beauty more visible, vice, because it underscores virtue; he loves stupidity and crime. All is good, and God blesses the diversity. The simplest man's utterance is significant to him, and he is more open to fools and illiterates than to the learned. He loves a soul which is "multi-storeyed, a dwelling on different levels", which above all is welcoming and proceeds where Fate decrees; he loves "people who can gossip with their neighbour about the house, hunting, claims for litigation, but also happily engage with a carpenter or gardener".

It is sheer falsehood and criminality to want to enclose the diversity of the world in doctrines and systems, falsehood to turn men away from their own unfettered judgement, from their own will, and to impose on them something which lies outside them. Only []{#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_pagebreak-rw_115}the contemptuous stand in the way of freedom, and Montaigne despises nothing more than "*la frénésie"*,[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_rw-num-footnote-20)]{#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_rw-ref-footnote-20 .ref-footnote} the violent madness of those dictators of the spirit who crave with supreme arrogance and vanity to impose on the world their "glad tidings" as the sole and indisputable truth, and for whom the blood of hundreds of thousands of men is as nothing in the fanatical pursuit of their cause.

This then is Montaigne's attitude in the face of life, and as with all freethinkers it comes back to tolerance. He who demands freedom of thought for himself recognizes the same right for all men, and no one respected this tenet better than Montaigne. He does not recoil in fear before the cannibals, those native Brazilians he meets in Rouen, just because they eat human beings. He states calmly and clearly that he finds that of less significance than the torment, torture and martyrdom of living men. There is no belief, no opinion that he refuses consideration, and his judgement is unclouded by prejudice: "I do not subscribe to this communal error of judging a man according to the way I perceive things." He guards himself against violence and brute force, which, insidiously, can ravage and desensitize the soul.

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_07.html_pagebreak-rw_116}It is vital to understand that ample proof exists to show man can always be free, whatever the epoch. When Calvin encourages the witch trials and has an adversary slowly burnt alive, when Torquemada condemns hundreds of men to the stake, their eulogizers put forward the plea that they could not have acted otherwise, being yoked to the held opinions of their epoch. But the human being is resolute. Even in those times of fanaticism, in the period of the *Malleus Maleficarum*, of the Chambre Ardente of the Inquisition, it was always possible for humane people to persist; not a single moment of all that horror could muddy the clarity of spirit and the humanity of an Erasmus, a Montaigne, a Castellio. And while the rest, the Sorbonne professors, the counsellors, the legates, the Zwinglis, the Calvins proclaim: "We know the truth," the response of Montaigne is: "What do I know?" While, through the Catherine wheel and banishment, they want to impose their "This is how you must live!" his counsel is: "Think your own thoughts, not mine! Live your life! Do not follow me blindly, but remain free!"

He who thinks freely for himself, honours all freedom on earth.

[W]{.dropcap}[HEN IN]{.smallcaps} 1570, in the thirty-eighth year of his life, Michel de Montaigne retires to his tower, he imagines his life has reached its final consummation. Like Shakespeare later, he had seen with an all too clear eye the fragility of everything: "the wantonness of administrative bodies, the debasement of grace and favour, the absurdity of politics, the monotonous tedium of the courts", and above all his own ineffectualness in the world. He had tried to help, but they were indifferent to his approach, yet always with the pride and bearing of a man who knows his own worth he struggled on to counsel the great men, to pacify the fanatics, though they were indifferent to him. Year on year the epoch becomes more tense, more restless, the country is in turmoil, the night of St Bartholomew sees the blood flow once more. Right to his door the civil war comes. So he takes the decision not to get embroiled in the melee, not to let himself be plagued by it any more. He no longer wishes to see the world; he only wants to reflect on his own self []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_118}in his study room, as if in a camera obscura. He has abdicated, given up hope. As others strain for eminent positions and to gain influence, celebrity, he labours only for himself. He has entrenched himself in his tower, he has raised the wall of his thousand books between himself and the clamour. Sometimes, still, he leaves his tower, as knight of the Order of St Michael he attends the funeral service of Charles IX, he applies himself to various tasks, sometimes providing a political mediation when they request it, but he remains determined not to involve his soul, to overcome the present, to see the battle of the dukes of Guise and Coligny like that of Plataea. He keeps at a safe distance from public appearance; he is unflinching, determined not to receive any more wounds, to remain detached; his world is himself. He desires only to preserve a few memories, assemble a few thoughts, to dream more than live and patiently await death, calmly preparing for it.

He says to himself what we all say to ourselves in comparable periods of mass insanity: never mind the world! You cannot change it, or improve anything. Focus on yourself, save in yourself what can be saved. Build as the others destroy, strive to remain sane in the deluge of madness. Close yourself off. Construct your own world. []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_119}But now comes the year 1580. For ten years, he has remained sequestered in his tower, cut off from the world, and he imagines that this is how he will end his days. But now he realizes his error, or rather his errors, and Montaigne is always a man to recognize errors. The first was to believe himself old at thirty-eight, to prepare himself for death prematurely and to inter himself alive. Now, at forty-eight, he notes with surprise that his senses have not declined, that on the contrary they are more lucid, his thought is more illumined, his soul more serene, more voracious, more eager. He cannot renounce it all so early, close the book of life as if already at the final page. It was a beautiful thing to read books, to spend an idle hour in Greece with Plato, to savour an hour of Seneca's wisdom, it was restful and calming to live alongside these companions from previous centuries, with the greatest minds of history. But one lives in one's own century, for better or worse, and the air of the time penetrates into even the most cloistered space, especially when it is a restive and feverish air, an oppressive, tempestuous time. We have all known it: even when closed in, the soul cannot remain at peace when the world beyond is in uproar. Through walls and windows we receive the tremors of []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_120}the time; you might win a moment's respite, but you cannot withdraw completely from the world.

And then another error, which Montaigne realizes only gradually: he had sought freedom by deserting the world of politics, of duties and official business, for the less visible world of home and family; but he is soon aware that he has merely swapped one set of bonds for another. It has served him not at all to root himself in his own domain, for here the creepers and tendrils climb about the trunk and the tiny mice of worry gnaw at the roots. Even the solitary tower, which he has appropriated and from which all are barred, has not helped. When he looks out of the window, he sees the fields white with frost and worries over the wine that will be spoilt. When he opens his books, he hears the rise of bickering voices and knows that when he leaves his room, he will have to endure the gripes of neighbours and sort out problems of the estate's administration. This is not the solitude of an anchorite proper, for he is the local squire and in this he finds no pleasure. Montaigne is resolutely detached: "Money is a tricky business, of which I know next to nothing." But property attaches itself to him; it won't let him go. Montaigne sees his situation with clarity. He knows that, from a higher perspective, all these []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_121}embryonic vexations morph into minor difficulties. He would so like to jettison them all: "It would be easy for me to give up everything." But so long as you remain immersed, you cannot get clear.

In himself, Montaigne is no Diogenes. He loves his house, his wealth, his noble title, and always carries with him, to ensure his inward calm, a little gold coffer. "There is a certain pleasure in mastering something, even if it is just a barn, to remain obedient beneath its roof, but in the end it proves too languid a pleasure and everything becomes tainted by petty vexations." He has just read Plato, but now he has to get embroiled in disputes with his people, enter into a lawsuit with his neighbour; each minor repair job in the chateau turns into a trial. Wisdom commands that he have done with these bothersome trivialities. But, as each of us knows, as long as you are the owner you remain attached to the property, or rather it attaches itself to you with a thousand tiny claws, and only one thing can save us: distance, which transforms everything. Only exterior distance allows for interior distance: "When away, I am free of such thoughts, and would feel less on hearing the total ruin of my tower than I do now at the news of a single fallen tile." He who is reduced to a confined []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_122}space, falls into a state of narrowness. All is relative. Montaigne never stops repeating:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_extract24 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
What we term worries do not possess a unique weight. It is we who exaggerate or diminish them. Whatever is close touches us more deeply than that which is far away. The more we reduce our space, the more the petty concerns prey on us. A man can never escape them completely. But he can take a break from them.
:::

These concerns, in his forty-eighth year, following the period of seclusion, awaken within him the "*humeur* *vagabonde*".[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_rw-num-footnote-21)]{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_rw-ref-footnote-21 .ref-footnote} Montaigne explains, with his characteristic humane plain-spokenness, all his reasons for returning to the world, renouncing customs and routines, and as ever he impressively articulates what each of us has felt. It's only between the lines that we can discern another explanation, just as crucial, for his flight from solitude. Always and everywhere, Montaigne sought freedom and renewal, but the family was a confinement, marriage a monotony, and we get the sense that he was rarely content in his domestic life. "Marriage," he believes, []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_123}"has a useful function, a legal commitment, honour, permanence---all dull and conformable pleasures." But Montaigne is the man of transformation; he has never cared for dull or conformable pleasures.

His own marriage had never been a union of love, but of the "intellectual", and he had condemned love marriages in favour of the "intellectual" on numerous occasions, claiming that he was only submitting to an "*habitude*". For centuries he was condemned for his unswerving belief in championing the right of the woman to take a lover; for this reason a number of biographies have doubted the paternity of his last children.

All this may just be supposition, though after several years of marriage, what he says tends to ring true: "In our century, women generally put off expressing their feelings and positive thoughts about their husbands until they are dead and buried. Our life is marred by bickering, and our death surrounded by love and ministrations." He even adds the following scabrous words: "There are few women whose health does not improve in widowhood, and health is a virtue which does not know how to lie."

After his experiences with Xanthippe, Socrates could only speak of marriage in the most acerbic manner: "Moreover, do not look into those moist eyes and fall []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_124}for that piteous voice." And it is believed that Socrates said to his own wife at the moment of his leave-taking: "A woman should not be so greedily attached to the front of a man that she cannot bear to see him turn his back, if he is obliged to do so." When by chance he writes of a good marriage, he is at pains to add the droll qualification: "If such a thing exists."

We see that the decade of solitude had been a contented one, but now things had gone far enough, and perhaps even too far. He felt himself fossilized, become narrow and mediocre, and if anyone railed his whole life long against lack of movement, it was Montaigne. With that instinct which always signals to the creative man when he must change his life, he recognized that the time had finally come: "The most opportune time to leave your house is when you have put everything in good order, so it can look after itself without you."

He had put his house in order. His fields and his affairs were in a robust condition and the coffers so full that he could allow for the expenses of a protracted journey; to his mind this was crucial, since one should not have to pay for the pleasures of a long absence by facing a deluge of troubles on one's return. He takes the manuscript of the *Essais* to the printer, two volumes, []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_125}this crystallization of a life, to be printed; the cycle is complete, they are left behind him like the snake's shed skin, to employ Goethe's favoured expression. Now it is time to start anew. He has breathed out, now he can breathe in again. He has rooted himself, now he can uproot himself again. A new stage of his life begins. On 22nd June 1580, at the age of forty-eight, following a decade of self imposed retreat---Montaigne had never done other than to obey his own will---he embarks on a journey which will distance him for two years from his wife, his tower, his homeland and his work, removing him from all but his own self.

It is a journey without end, a journey made for the simple love of travelling, or better still for the love of the pleasure of travelling. Until then his travels had always been, in some sense, missions, on the order of the parliament, to serve the court or on personal business. These were more like brief displacements; this time it's a real journey, whose only objective is the eternal: finding oneself. He makes no plans, he has no real idea what he will see, on the contrary: he doesn't want to know in advance; and when people question him, he contentedly replies: "I []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_126}have no idea what I am looking for abroad, but I know very well what I am fleeing."

His life has for so long been set in stone, and now he yearns for something different, and the more different the better! All those who are happy to remain by the fireside, who are content with this futile restriction, he does not envy. Only change attracts him, only from inside himself is he promised a harvest. Nothing enraptures him so much in the idea of travel as the fact that all will be different: the language, the sky, the customs and the people, the atmosphere, the cuisine, the streets and the beds. For him seeing is learning, comparing, better understanding all that demonstrates the perennial diversity of human nature: "And I know no better school of life, as I have said so often, than that which reveals the way others live their lives."

A new chapter opens for him. Out of the art of living comes the art of travel, to become the art of life.

Montaigne travels to liberate himself, and throughout this journey he affords us a shining example of how to be free. He travels, so to speak, on instinct. As a traveller, he avoids anything that might constrain him, even a self-imposed constraint. The road will lead him where it will, the mood carry him wherever it cares to go. What []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_127}he wants is to be travelling, rather than merely to travel. The Monsieur Michel de Montaigne in Bordeaux does not know whether Monsieur Michel de Montaigne will be in Paris or Augsburg during the coming weeks. It is the other Montaigne, the one in Augsburg or Paris, who will decide it in absolute freedom. He is at pains to remain wholly free within himself.

He is only interested in moving on. When he thinks he has missed something en route, he takes to the road again. Not to be tied down to anything, not to plan ahead, gradually becomes an obsession. Even the idea of knowing where the road is heading can sometimes exact a gentle pressure on him:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_extract25 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
I take such immense pleasure in travelling that even the mere approximation to a prearranged destination became repugnant to me and I thought of the different ways I could continue on my own, travelling only for myself and at my own ease.
:::

He did not seek out curiosities, because all that was different along the way seemed equally curious to him. On the contrary, when an area was well known, he preferred to avoid it, because too many others had []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_128}written about it. Rome, iconic destination of all travellers, is for him a poor proposition from the start, because everyone else wants to go there, and his secretary notes in his journal: "I think it truthful to say, had he selfishly obeyed his own desires, he would far rather have gone to Crakow or Greece than followed the tour to Italy." The Montaigne maxim is always the same: the more novelty around a thing, the better it is; even when he does not find what he is expecting, or is made to wait, he is never disheartened:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_extract26 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
When I find something missing in a place, that the reports falsely claimed was there, I do not fret about it, and my efforts are not wasted, because at least I have now learnt that this or that was in fact not true.
:::

For the genuine traveller nothing is a disappointment. Like Goethe, he tells himself that chagrin is an equally vital part of life:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_extract27 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
The difference in character of one nation over another enthrals me in the sheer pleasure to be had from its infinite variety. To my eyes, every custom is authentic in its own way. Whether the dishes are []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_129}of tin, of wood, or earthenware, the food boiled or roasted, buttered or in olive oil, hot or cold, it's all the same to me.
:::

And this old sceptic is ashamed of his fellow countrymen, chained to the error of thinking that, parrot-like, they must indulge in criticizing all foreign customs as soon as they find themselves beyond their village, outside their familiar surroundings. When abroad Montaigne wants to see the foreign---"Not to seek out other Gascons in Sicily (I see quite enough of them at home)"---he wants to evade his compatriots, whom anyway he knows inside out. He wants to judge without prejudgement. Among so many other things, Montaigne teaches us how one should travel.

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_blank-line9 .paras .blank-line .exclude-auto}
 
:::

With a final ill omen---you can sense it in the reply that he gives---others clearly seek to hold back this impetuous traveller and keep him at home. "What will happen if you fall sick abroad?" they demand of him. In truth Montaigne has suffered for three years from the sickness that afflicted all learned men in those times, the probable consequence of a sedentary life and an unbalanced []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_130}diet. Like Erasmus and Calvin he endured the torture of kidney stones, which must have been an even more terrible ordeal when trotting along on a horse, for months at a time, on foreign highways. But Montaigne, who set off on his journey to find as much freedom as he could muster, and if possible renewed health, shrugs his shoulders with indifference:

::: {#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_extract28 .block .extract .exclude-auto}
If things look ugly to the left, I turn to the right; if I feel ill when mounted, I just call halt... did I miss something of interest behind me? I turn around and retrace my steps. That's always the way I travel.
:::

Furthermore, he always has a ready response when they worry about seeing him die in a foreign land. If he was to fear such a thing then he would hardly set foot outside the domain of Montaigne, still less go beyond the borders of France. Death is omnipresent and, in the end, he would far rather meet it on horseback than in bed.

A true cosmopolitan, he is resigned to his fate.

On the 22nd June 1580, Michel de Montaigne breaches the gate of his chateau for freedom beyond. Accompanying him are his brother-in-law, a few comrades and a younger brother of twenty. The choice has []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_131}not been altogether a happy one: these companions, he would later testify, were not among the best, but for their part they were forced to endure the strange and capricious habit on the part of Montaigne "*de visiter les pays* *inconnus*".[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_rw-num-footnote-22)]{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_rw-ref-footnote-22 .ref-footnote} This is not quite the departure of a great lord, but still a handsome train. The vital thing is to eschew all prejudgements, refrain from arrogance or deep-rooted views.

The road leads first to Paris, the city which Montaigne has always adored and which still enchants him. A few copies of his book have preceded him, but he carries two personal volumes, to present to the king. In truth Henri III does not have much taste for this sort of thing; he is more accustomed to war. But as everyone at court reads the book and is charmed by it, he too reads it and invites Montaigne to be present at the siege of La Fère. Montaigne, who is curious about everything, revisits after many years the true horrors of war when one of his friends, Philibert, Comte de Gramont, is killed by a cannonball. He accompanies the corpse to Soissons and begins his remarkable journal on 5th September 1580. By a strange coincidence, Goethe's father, a rather cold official, and Montaigne's father, []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_132}a soldier for King François I, both began and brought back from Italy a journal, and Montaigne, the son of Pierre Eyquem, maintains the tradition, as later will the son of counsellor Goethe. His secretary makes a note of all events that occur on the journey to Rome, where Montaigne takes a break from the saddle. There, obeying his will to embed himself as deeply as possible into the country he is visiting, he continues the journal himself, employing a rather rudimentary Italian, until the day when he finally returns across the French frontier: "Here they speak French, so now I shall abandon this foreign language." Thus we are able to follow this journey from beginning to end.

First stop are the baths of Plombières, where Montaigne, over the course of a strict ten-day cure, strives to assuage his illness; next come Basle, Schaffhausen, Konstanz, Augsburg, Munich and the Tyrol, then Verona, Vicenza, Padua, Venice and, from there, Ferrara, Bologna and Florence, and on to Rome, where Montaigne arrives on 15th November. Admittedly these travel notes are not a work of art, inasmuch as Montaigne has only written a very brief account and in a language not his own. The artist in Montaigne is not displayed here, but rather the man in all his qualities and petty []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_133}foibles; it's a touching trait and somehow characteristic of the vanity of a parvenu, that Montaigne, grandson of a fish-trader, offers his hosts a beautiful portrait of his armorial bearings, as a particularly precious farewell gift. It's always a pleasure---and who knew this better than Montaigne?---to observe a prudent man in his folly, and a free man who despises all ceremony, in his vanity.

In the beginning, things turn out well. Montaigne is in the best humour, and curiosity gets him through his illness. This man of forty-eight years, who jokes endlessly about his "*vieillesse*",[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_rw-num-footnote-23)]{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_rw-ref-footnote-23 .ref-footnote} outstrips the younger men in terms of endurance. At an early hour, he saddles up and, having eaten little more than a crust of bread, sets off; it all seems wonderful to him: the sedan chair, the taste of the bread, the coach, the saddle, even going on foot. The shabby inns provide amusement rather than aggravation. His greatest joy in every place is to encounter new people: unfamiliar people and unfamiliar customs. Wherever he goes he seeks out people of all different types. With each, he tries to discover what is their "*gibier*",[[†](#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_rw-num-footnote-24)]{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_rw-ref-footnote-24 .ref-footnote} or as we might say, "passion". Seeking people, he is indifferent to social differences, dining at []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_134}Ferrara with the duke, chatting with the Pope, then with Protestant clergymen, Zwinglians and Calvinists. His attractions are not those that we might find in the pages of a Baedeker. He scarcely mentions the Raphaels, the Michelangelos, the monuments. Instead he attends the execution of a criminal, has himself invited into the home of a Jewish family to witness the circumcision of a child, visits libraries, enters the Bagni di Lucca, invites peasants to the ball; chats away with all the *lazzarones*. But he eschews all the celebrated sites. For him all that is natural is to be celebrated. He had the advantage over Goethe of not being limited by a Winckelmann, who imposed on all travellers of his epoch the notion that they must make of it a study of the history of art. It is real life that Montaigne explores in Switzerland and Italy. For him all life has equal value. He attends the Mass for the Pope and is received by him. He holds long conversations with Church dignitaries, who respectfully offer him counsel on the next edition of his book and pray only that the great sceptic do away with the word "fortune", which he includes too often, and replace it with "God", or "Divine Providence". They fete him, naming him with great ceremony a citizen of Rome, and he goes along with it all, for he is proud of this []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_135}honour (the parvenu element in the free man). But this does not prevent him vowing to pursue his principal interest in Rome, as formerly in Venice: the courtesans, whose morals and peculiarities have more prominence in his journal than the Sistine Chapel or the cathedral of Florence. A youthful vigour seems to have touched him, which seeks its natural path. He seems to have left behind with these ladies a good part of the gold he carries with him in the coffer; their conversation, as he suggests, often proves in the end far more costly than their other services.

The final leg of his journey is mostly wasted due to illness. He takes a cure at the Bagni di Lucca, a barbaric cure. His hatred of physicians drives him to invent a new therapy. Free in all things, he desires to be his own doctor. Severe pains afflict him, to which are added murderous toothache and headaches. At one point he considers suicide. During this cure, news reaches him which could hardly have put him in better spirits. The citizens of Bordeaux have elected him mayor of their city. This is a surprising nomination, for eleven years previously, Montaigne had resigned all functions as a mere councilman. But the still youthful glory of his works had encouraged the citizens of Bordeaux to place this []{#9781782271468_chapter_08.html_pagebreak-rw_136}burden on him without his knowledge or cooperation; moreover, it is possible his own family was trying to draw him back with this lure. Whatever the case, he returns to Rome, and from Rome joins his wife once more in the family home, after an absence of seventeen months and eight days, as he notes with precision. He arrives at his chateau on 30th November 1581 a little younger, with his spirit rejuvenated and more vital than ever. Two years later the last of his children is born.

[M]{.dropcap}[ONTAIGNE]{.smallcaps}[ SET OUT]{.smallcaps} to achieve the most difficult thing on earth: to live dedicated to the self, to be free and become ever more so. When he reaches his fiftieth year, he feels he is near achieving this. But then something strange occurs: at the very moment when he is withdrawn from the world and entirely turned in on himself, the world seeks him out. As a young man he had petitioned for public life and stateliness; then, he was spurned. Now, those in power wish to foist these things on him. In vain did he offer his services to kings and make approaches to the court; now they want to raise him to new positions, ever more prestigious. At the very moment when he seeks only to locate the man who is his true self, the others recognize his genuine worth.

When, on 7th September 1581, he receives the letter which informs him that he has been elected mayor of Bordeaux "unanimously" and which begs him, "for the love of his country", to accept this "charge"---which for him is really a yoke---he seems not yet decided to []{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_138}renounce his liberty. He feels he has become an invalid, his kidney stones causing suffering to the point that he envisages suicide as the only escape: "When a man can no longer bear these sufferings, then he must boldly and promptly make an end of it. That is the only medicine, the only principle, the only science." What good to accept such a burden, when he has just realized his sacred interior duty, a burden which will only bring more suffering, without hope of riches or honours? But when Montaigne returns to the chateau, he finds a letter from the king, dated 25th November, which, without any ambiguity, transforms the simple wish of the citizens into a command. The king begins by amiably expressing his joy in ratifying a choice made spontaneously in Montaigne's absence, but goes on to say he should accept the post right away "without procrastination or extenuation". The final phrase forbids any retreat: "In taking this step you will bring me great contentment, but by refusing you will bring equal displeasure." Such an order from the king must be obeyed unquestioningly. Grudgingly Montaigne now assumes this role, inherited like the kidney stones from his father, and from now on is mayor of the city.

From the start his extraordinary honesty puts his electors on guard. They cannot expect him to replicate []{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_139}the total devotion to office shown by his father, whose soul he saw "cruelly tortured by this public burden" and who gave up his best years, his health and his domestic life for it. Certainly, he harbours no hatred, ambition, avarice or belligerence, but he knows his weaknesses: what he lacks is memory, "vigilance", attention given to a particular moment, experience and energy. As ever, Montaigne decides to keep for himself the rarest element, the best, the most precious, "*son essence*", to accomplish, with the greatest care and faithfulness, all that is demanded of him and is imposed on him, but nothing more. To demonstrate that this appointment was not of his own free will, he does not relocate to Bordeaux, but remains in his chateau, in Montaigne. But it seems that, as in the writings, wherever Montaigne invests even a portion of his pain, his concerns and his time, he still accomplishes more than anyone else, due to the sharpness of his judgement and his profound knowledge of the world. That the citizens re-elected him in July 1583, at the end of his first mandate, proves that they were not unhappy with him.

But this single function, this sole duty was not enough: hardly had the city reclaimed him than the court, the state and the world of politics reclaimed him too. For []{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_140}years the powerful had looked down on Montaigne with a kind of disapproval which the professional politicians and party men always reserved for the free and independent man. They scorned him for his passivity in an epoch in which, as he says, "the whole world was simply overactive." He was not attached to any king, any party, any group, and had not selected his friends for their party badge or their religious affiliations, but solely for their individual merit. Such a man was of little use in an either-or epoch, in an epoch when either victory beckoned or the extermination of the Huguenots in France. But now, after the bestial ravages of the civil war, after the fanaticism which bordered on the absurd, what was once a political flaw, not belonging to any particular party, suddenly becomes a badge of merit; a man who has always remained aloof from prejudices, stayed apart from the factions, eschewed political gain or glory, becomes the ideal mediator. The situation in France becomes bizarrely transformed. On the death of the Duc d'Anjou, the law of succession makes Henri de Navarre (the future Henri IV), widower of the daughter of Catherine de' Medici, the legitimate heir to the throne of Henri III. But Henri de Navarre is a Huguenot and leader of the Huguenot party. In[]{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_141}this role, he opposes the court, which seeks to suppress the Huguenots, and the royal chateau, from where was issued, ten years earlier, the order for the St Bartholomew massacre; and the opposing party, the Guise, seeks to prevent this order of legitimate succession. But, since Henri de Navarre has no intention of renouncing his right to the throne, a new civil war seems inevitable if no agreement can be forged between himself and Henri III. For this great mission, this historic mission which could ensure peace in all of France, a man like Montaigne makes the perfect mediator, not only due to his tolerant way of thinking, but because he has the confidence of King Henri III as well as the pretender Henri de Navarre. A friendship of a kind bonds him to this young crown prince and Montaigne maintains it, even at the moment when Henri de Navarre is excommunicated by the Church and when Montaigne, as he confesses later to his priest, feels it a grave sin to remain aligned to him.

In 1584, Henri de Navarre pays a visit to the chateau of Montaigne, with a train of forty aristocrats and their retinue of servants, and sleeps in his host's own bed. He also confides his most secret plans to him, and how well Montaigne performs in this responsibility is demonstrated []{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_142}years later when a fresh crisis erupts, the gravest of all, between Henri III and the future Henri IV, and once again the two men call on Montaigne as mediator.

In 1585, Montaigne's second mandate as mayor of Bordeaux would have come to its end and he should then have retired with the customary speeches and honours. But Fate did not have such an agreeable path in mind. He had stood firm, with fortitude and courage, while the city was threatened by the civil war that reignited the antipathy between Huguenots and the League. He organized the arming of the city, even performed lookout duties himself day and night alongside the sentries and readied the defences. But it is in the face of another, quite different enemy, the plague, which reaches Bordeaux that very year, that Montaigne flees in panic, abandoning the city to its fate. For one with his egocentric preoccupations, health is all. He is no hero, and never pretended to be one.

We cannot know what the plague really meant in that time. We only know that it was the signal for flight, for Erasmus as for anyone else. In the city of Bordeaux, 17,000 people would perish in less than six months, []{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_143}half the population. Whoever has a cart or a horse, flees; only "*le menu* *peuple*"[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_rw-num-footnote-25)]{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_rw-ref-footnote-25 .ref-footnote} remain. The plague even reaches Montaigne's house. He promptly decides to leave it. Everyone takes to the road, his old mother Antoinette de Louppes, his wife and his daughter. It is now that he is properly able to display his strength of character, for he finds himself "relentlessly pursued by a thousand different pestilences." His fortune suffered heavy losses, he was obliged to leave his chateau empty and unprotected, so anyone could help themselves to whatever they wanted, and no doubt did. Without even a coat, dressed in whatever he happens to have on, he flees the house without knowing where he is going, for no one will take in a family fleeing a plague-ridden city.

It is a horrifying journey; along the way, they see fields laid waste, villages abandoned, bodies lying rotting in the []{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_144}open without coffins. For six months he must "perform the wretched role of guide for this melancholy caravan", and during this time, the *jurats* to whom he has entrusted the entire administration of the city pester him endlessly with letter after letter. Embittered by Montaigne's flight, they demand his return and finally announce that his mandate has ended. But Montaigne fails to arrive on the agreed date for the handover of powers.

In this flight of panic before the plague, a measure of honour, of glory, of dignity is inevitably lost. But the "*essence*" is saved. Having wandered for half a year, Montaigne returns to his chateau in December, once the plague has dissipated, and reapplies himself to his customary task: to search for himself, to know himself. He begins a new book of *Essais*, the third. He is once more in a state of liberty, free of afflictions, save for the kidney stones. He only needs to remain at peace and await that which has now on a number of occasions "touched his hand": death. It seems that he must know peace after having lived so fully: war and peace, the world, the life of the heart and solitude, poverty and riches, activity and pleasure, health and sickness, travel []{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_145}and rootedness, glory and anonymity, love and honour, friendship and solitude.

But he misses one last thing; he has not yet savoured all experiences. One more time the world calls for him. The situation between Henri de Navarre and Henri III is dangerously tense. The king sent an army under the command of Joyeuse, and Henri de Navarre completely defeated it at Coutras on 23rd October 1587. As victor, Henri de Navarre could feasibly now march on Paris and assume the throne by force. But his intellect tells him not to risk his success in a rash adventure. He wants another stab at negotiation. Three days after the battle, a troop of horsemen passes down the drive to the chateau of Montaigne. Their leader requests entry, which is immediately accorded. It is Henri de Navarre in person, who has come to ask advice of Montaigne on the most astute way of exploiting his victory, diplomatically and peacefully at the same time. It's a secret mission. Montaigne must travel to Paris and meet with the king as mediator, putting to him Henri de Navarre's propositions. Montaigne acted, and this action led to the conversion of Henri de Navarre to Catholicism, guaranteeing centuries of peace and the glory of France.

[]{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_146}Montaigne sets off immediately, in the depths of winter. In his luggage, he carries a corrected copy of the *Essais* and the manuscript of the third book. But it does not prove a peaceful journey. For the second time, he is caught up in civil war and barely has he arrived in Paris when he is arrested and thrown into the Bastille. He is only incarcerated for a day, because Catherine de' Medici arranges for his release. But once again, this man who searched for freedom everywhere was forced to endure its privation in yet another form. He travels on to Chartres, Rouen and Blois to continue his negotiations with the king. Having fulfilled his mission, he returns once again to his chateau.

In this old chateau, the slight man now sits in his room in the tower. He has aged, his hair having receded to reveal a bare crown; he cut his beautiful chestnut-brown beard as soon as it began to go grey. The void has widened around him, his old mother still passes through the rooms like a shadow; she is almost ninety years old. His brothers have left, his daughter has married and gone to live with her husband. He has a house but has no idea who will claim it after his death. He has a coat of arms and he []{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_147}knows he will be the last to bear it. It seems everything has now passed. But it is precisely in this last hour that everything comes back to him; now that it is too late, positions are offered to he who now mistrusts them. In 1590, Henri de Navarre, to whom he has been friend and counsellor, becomes King Henri IV of France. Now Montaigne should hasten to the court, where everyone hastens, and he will be assured of the highest position there, he who counselled and counselled so admirably. He could become what Michel de L'Hôpital was under the reign of Catherine de' Medici, the wise counsellor who preaches clemency, the great chancellor. But Montaigne wants none of it; he is content to greet the king with a letter, apologizing for his absence. He praises the king indulgently and writes these sublime words: "A great historic conqueror can be proud of having given so many occasions for his subjugated enemies to love him, just as his friends." But if kings do not like those who seek their favour, they like still less those who do not seek it. A few months later, the king writes to his old counsellor in a drier tone, to win his service, and it seems that he also makes financial propositions. But already ill-disposed to serve, Montaigne is less disposed to being bought. He responds proudly to the king:[]{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_148}

He knows that he has managed what Plato says somewhere: that there is nothing more difficult in the world than to leave public life with a clean pair of hands. With pride he writes the words that form the retrospective of his life: if one really wanted to look to the depths of his soul, then one would see that he was incapable of getting too involved with anyone, incapable of doing anyone harm, incapable of envy or vengeance, incapable of causing offence or of not keeping his word:

At the end of Montaigne's life, the highest dignitaries had called on him, something he had not wanted for a long time and hardly expected. And in a brief moment before his death, when he feels old and is only a reflection, a shadow, of himself, he is granted something which he had dared not hope for, a ray of tenderness and love. Wistfully he had said that only love could still awaken him.

And then suddenly the unimaginable happens. A young woman, Marie de Gournay, from one of the most aristocratic French families, a woman barely older than his youngest daughter, discovers a passion for Montaigne's books. She loves him, worships him, seeks her ideal in this man. In what measure this love extended to the man as well as the writer remains difficult to ascertain, as always in such cases. But Montaigne often goes to seek her out again, sojourning in her family's chateau on the outskirts of Paris for a month at a time. She becomes his "*fille* *d'alliance*"[[\*](#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_rw-num-footnote-26)]{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_rw-ref-footnote-26 .ref-footnote} and he assigns to her his most precious legacy: the new edition of the *Essais*, which in the end will be published posthumously.

And now, there is only one thing left to know, for he who studied life and all experiences: the very last among []{#9781782271468_chapter_09.html_pagebreak-rw_150}them, death. He dies wisely, as he lived wisely. His friend Pierre de Brach writes that his death was a gentle one, "following a fortuitous life", and that it is surely good fortune that he was finally released from his crippling gout and those excruciating kidney stones. The fruits of his spirit will never cease to exercise their charm on men of spirit and of good taste.

Michel de Montaigne receives the last rites on 13th September 1592, and dies shortly afterwards. With him the line of the Eyquems and the Paçagons ends. He does not rest, like his father, "alongside his ancestors", but alone in the Église des Feuillants in Bordeaux, the first and last Montaigne and the only one whose name will carry across the ages.
