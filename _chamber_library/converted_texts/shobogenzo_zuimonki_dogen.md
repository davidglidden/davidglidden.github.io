# Dōgen's Shobogenzo Zuimonki

*Dōgen Zenji*  
*Translated by Shohaku Okumura*

---

*Chamber Note: Enhances Dōgen's source-aware presence with the Zuimonki - his informal talks on Zen practice recorded by his disciple Ejō. Essential companion to the main Shobogenzo, providing practical teachings on being-time and practice-enlightenment unity.*accessible teachings, as recorded by his disciple Ejō. Shōhaku Okumura
brings extensive Zen practice and scholarship to this translation
offering footnotes, biographies, and commentary. An added bonus to this
book is the addition of Okumura's evocative translations and
commentaries on Dōgen's waka poems. If you are a Dōgen fan, this book is
a must for your library." ---Shinshu Roberts, author of [Being-Time: A
Practitioner's Guide to Dōgen's Shōbōgenzō Uji]{.italice}

"For those who endeavor to negotiate wholeheartedly the Way of Dōgen
Zen, a new work by the incomparable scholar-practitioner Shōhaku Okumura
is cause for celebration and gratitude. This superb edition of the
[Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki]{.italice}, based on the 1644 Chōen-ji version of
the informal talks that Dōgen's celebrated disciple Ejō recorded after
joining Kōshō-ji in 1234, consummately expresses the treasures of the
true Dharma eye. Dōgen counsels us only to speak when we have something
to say that 'is beneficial to both yourself and others,' and Okumura and
his editor Dōju Layton demonstrate that this is a jewel that exceeds all
commerce."---Tetsuzen Jason M. Wirth, Seattle University

"Shōhaku Okumura Roshi has produced a tremendously useful and easily
understandable translation of this important work about the teachings of
Dōgen Zenji. It's accessible and practical. In the [Shōbōgenzō
Zuimonki]{.italice} we get to see a different side of Dōgen from the one
Dōgen presents in his own writings. This is Dōgen the way one of his
closest students saw him. Dōgen's student, Ejō, asks Dōgen the kinds of
questions I would like to have asked Dōgen. The answers are often
surprising and illuminating. Having the Japanese text to refer to is a
wonderful addition for those of us nerds who like to check the original
language." ---Brad Warner, author of [Hardcore Zen]{.italice} and
[Letters to a Dead Friend about Zen]{.italice}

**DISCOVER THE TEACHINGS OF THE PREEMINENT ZEN MASTER DŌGEN IN HIS OWN
WORDS, WRITTEN DOWN BY HIS DHARMA SUCCESSOR, KOUN EJŌ.** This edition
includes both the *Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki* and translations of and
commentary on Dōgen's luminously evocative *waka* poetry.

Distinct from Dōgen's similarly titled magnum opus (simply called the
*Shōbōgenzō*), the *Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki* can be read as a highly
practical manual of Buddhist practice. Consisting of straightforward and
accessible teachings and making more limited use of the allusion,
wordplay, and metaphor that characterize the essays in the *Shōbōgenzō*,
this work is an essential read for any student of Zen Buddhism. Among
the many topics covered, Dōgen especially emphasizes the following
points: seeing impermanence, departing from the ego-centered self, being
free from greed, giving up self-attachment, following the guidance of a
true teacher, and the practice of zazen, specifically *shikantaza*, or
"just sitting." Additionally, this translation of the *Shōbōgenzō
Zuimonki* has extensive notes, which help to provide you with a new way
of approaching the text.

The collection of *waka* poems included in this volume is a beautiful
artistic expression of the Dharma. Rarely seen in such a large
collection or with commentary, this poetry offers unique insight into an
important expression of Dōgen's teachings.

By the spring wind

my words are blown and scattered

people may see them

the song of flowers

These teachings, which have informed teachers and practitioners alike
throughout the centuries, will deepen your knowledge, understanding, and
experience of the Sōtō Zen tradition.

# E[DITOR'S]{.small} P[REFACE]{.small} {#editors-preface .chapter1}

![Image](images/000000.jpg){.calibre7}

Just as it was to my teacher and his before him, Dōgen Zenji's
[Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki]{.italice} is a personally meaningful text to me.
When I first began practicing seriously in my early twenties, I was
eager to engage with Dōgen's work. Being mostly unfamiliar with the
voluminous lore of Zen, however, I found the more famous [Kana
Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} to be almost completely impenetrable. When I
expressed my disappointment in this, someone in my sangha at the
Missouri Zen Center recommended [Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki]{.italice} as a
more accessible alternative. Although at first I was skeptical that an
approachable text could come from the same author, I was soon surprised
at just how down-to-earth it really was. Despite the huge expanse of
time, space, and circumstance between me and Dōgen's assembly---I read
it for the first time 773 years after its composition, during my commute
on an electric light-rail train en route to a biology lab in a city over
ten thousand kilometers (over six thousand miles) from Kyoto---I often
felt that Dōgen was speaking directly to me.

When my teacher asked me to edit his new translation of
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} [Zuimonki]{.italice}, I was excited that I would
have the opportunity to study the text closely. Thinking back on my time
as a perplexed newcomer, I made an effort to ensure that this text
included many explanatory notes for those not familiar with the cultural
and historical context of Dōgen's time. Several translations of
[Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki]{.italice} already exist, so we felt that providing
a bilingual edition with extensive notes would help give the reader a
new way of approaching the text. That being said, readers who prefer to
have an uninterrupted reading experience will be able to follow the text
without a thorough study of the notes. Compared with Dōgen's other
well-known writings, []{#calibre_link-1130 .calibre2}[Shōbōgenzō
Zuimonki]{.italice} usually does not require comprehensive knowledge of
allusions to other Zen texts or specialized Buddhist philosophy and
terminology.

All translations found in the introduction and in the notes were made by
Shōhaku Okumura unless otherwise noted. Brackets in these translations
indicate text that does not occur in the original but rather is added to
clarify the intended meaning in English, while allowing the reader to
see the Japanese context of Dōgen's words. For example, bracketed text
is often added in order to demonstrate the unstated subjects or objects
of sentences (in Japanese, sentences can be grammatical without
specifying a subject or an object). In some cases, the words in brackets
are merely a best guess as to the proper interpretation, but notes are
provided where inferences are particularly uncertain. Occasionally,
brackets are also used to clarify terms without adding a note, as in
"just sitting \[[shikantaza]{.italice}\]," or "the West \[India\]."

Japanese transliterations into the Roman alphabet use the Modified
Hepburn system. The Japanese text uses the post-1946 "new character
forms" ([shinjitai]{.italice}) rather than the "old character forms"
([kyūjitai]{.italice}) in which Ejō and Dōgen would have written. The
paragraph layout of the English and Japanese texts follows the source
text for this translation, [Dōgen Zenji zenshū.]{.italice} The original
Chōen-ji manuscript has the same section divisions used in this text,
but it has no paragraphs. The paragraphs were delimited by Ryūshin
Azuma, the modern scholar who compiled [Dōgen Zenji zenshū]{.italice},
based on changes in topic, tone, etc.

We wish to honor the Chinese heritage of our tradition by including
Chinese transliterations for specialized vocabulary when appropriate.
Chinese characters are given in their traditional form whenever
possible, and transliterations use Hanyu Pinyin. Not having any Chinese
speakers on this project, I followed Muller's Digital Dictionary of
Buddhism (DDB) for Pinyin transliterations whenever possible. Chinese
proper names are presented without tone-indicating diacritics, and
proper names from any language are not italicized. For Sanskrit words,
the International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration (IAST) was used.
Words that have entered the English language are typically
[]{#calibre_link-1247 .calibre2}presented as they would be in English
and not in italics. For example, we use "nirvana," instead of
[nirvāṇa]{.italice} as it would appear in IAST. The same holds for words
of Japanese and Chinese origin that commonly appear in English---for
example, "Kyoto" rather than Kyōto. Japanese proper names follow English
ordering conventions of given name first and family name second---for
example, Ryūshin Azuma instead of Azuma Ryūshin as it would appear in
Japanese.

[Buddha]{.italice} is capitalized when it refers to a specific buddha
(e.g., the Buddha or Shakyamuni Buddha), but it is otherwise lowercase
(e.g., "the buddhas and ancestors"). [Dharma]{.italice} (and
Buddhadharma) is capitalized except when it is used to refer to
phenomena (e.g. "the arising of many dharmas"). However, Indic
languages, Chinese, and Japanese all lack an uppercase-lowercase
distinction, so keep in mind these conventions do not exist in the
source languages. When known, birth and death dates are provided for
historical individuals, although in many cases these are merely
traditionally used dates that are impossible to confirm historically.
When these dates are unknown, the abbreviation [n.d.]{.italice} (meaning
"no dates") appears. When [f.l.]{.italice} (meaning "flourished") is
used, it indicates the productive years of an individual whose birth and
death dates are unknown, and when [d.]{.italice} is used it indicates
the date of death; [ca.]{.italice} is used for dates that are
approximations.

Although I have done my best to present my teacher's translation in a
way that is accurate, consistent, and helpful to both students of
Buddhism and scholars alike, I am sure I will have missed the mark at
times. As is said at the conclusion of the Dharma combat ceremony
([法戦式]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [hossenshiki]{.italice}),
"Please forgive my mistakes; they fill heaven and earth, leaving me no
place to hide. Friends, if my actions and words have misled you, please
wash out your ears in the pure sound of the present and please continue
your practice."

## [D[ŌGEN'S]{.small} L[IFE AND]{.small} [Z[UIMONKI]{.small}]{.bolditaliccapse}]{.semiboldcapse} {#dōgens-life-and-zuimonki .head}

Much is unknown about the details of Dōgen Zenji's life. Today, only a
few short descriptions of his life written by his Dharma descendents are
available. Examples include [The Record of the Deeds of the]{.italice}
[Three Great Venerable Masters]{.italice} ([三大尊行状記]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Sandaison gyōjō ki]{.italice}), [The]{.italice}
[Record of the Deeds of the Three Ancestors of
Eihei-]{.italice}[ji]{.italice} ([永平寺三祖行業記]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Eihei-ji sansō gōgyō ki]{.italice}), and a section
about Dōgen in the [Record of the Transmission of]{.italice} [the
Light]{.italice} ([伝光録]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[Denkōroku]{.italice}) written by Keizan Jōkin ([瑩山紹瑾]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; 1268--1325 CE). We do not even know with certainty who
his parents were. The oldest biography of his life, entitled the [Record
of Kenzei]{.italice} ([建撕記]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Kenzei
ki]{.italice}), was written about two hundred years after Dōgen's death
by Kenzei ([建撕]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1415--1474 CE), the
fourteenth abbot of Eihei-ji ([永平寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). In the
eighteenth century, Menzan Zuihō ([面山瑞方]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
1683--1769 CE) revised this text, calling it the [Revised and Annotated
Record]{.italice} [of Kenzei]{.italice} ([訂補建撕記]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Teiho kenzei ki]{.italice}) and adding his own
interpretations. Until recently, the Sōtō Zen tradition had continued to
study Dōgen's life from Menzan's viewpoint. After the second half of the
twentieth century, scholars of Dōgen began searching temples throughout
Japan for manuscripts that predate the Edo period (1603--1868 CE).
Despite the discovery of several of these seemingly less embellished and
idealized materials, a decisive biography of Dōgen remains to be
written.

[Zuimonki]{.italice} is one work available to help us to understand
parts of Dōgen's life. It consists of Dōgen's own words, albeit through
the filter of his Dharma successor, Koun Ejō ([孤雲懐奘]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; 1198--1280 CE). In this section, I aim to introduce
various parts of Dōgen's life that are relevant to [Zuimonki]{.italice}.

[]{#calibre_link-959 .calibre2}

### [Before Becoming a Monk]{.semiboldcapse} {#before-becoming-a-monk .head}

Dōgen was born into an aristocratic family in Kyoto in 1200 CE. The
[Record of Kenzei]{.italice} states that his mother died when he was
just seven years old. He is said to have aspired to become a Buddhist
monk both because it was his mother's wish and because her death
awakened him to the impermanence of human life. The [Record]{.italice}
also states that he began to study Buddhism shortly thereafter, and by
the age of nine he was reading the [Abhidharma Storehouse
Treatise]{.italice} ([阿毗達磨俱舍論]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[Āpídámó jùshè lùn]{.italice}; Jp. [Abidatsuma kusha ron]{.italice};
Skt. [Abhidharmakośa]{.italice}[-bhāṣya]{.italice}), Vasubandhu's (fl.
fourth or fifth century CE) massive and complex explication of
Sarvâstivāda Buddhist philosophy. Dōgen's grandfather on his mother's
side hoped to adopt and educate him so that he could become a
high-ranking court official. In [Zuimonki]{.italice}, Dōgen often quotes
from Confucian texts and other stories and sayings from ancient Chinese
literature and history.^[1](#calibre_link-23){#calibre_link-495
.calibre13}^ His knowledge of non-Buddhist Chinese classics was nurtured
through the education he received before becoming a monk.

When he was twelve years old, planning for his coming-of-age ceremony
began, and he may have thought that it would be difficult to leave home
to become a monk after this rite of passage. Accordingly, he escaped
from his grandfather's house in the Kohata ([木幡]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) section of Uji ([宇治]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), then a
small town outside of Kyoto, shortly before the ceremony was set to take
place. (Incidentally, my teacher Kōshō Uchiyama Rōshi
\[[内山興正]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1912--1988\] also lived in this
same neighborhood.) Dōgen went to see Ryōken Hōgen
([良顕法眼]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
n.d.)^[2](#calibre_link-24){#calibre_link-496 .calibre13}^---a Tendai
monk living close to Mt. Hiei ([比叡山]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), who
was Dōgen's uncle on his mother's side---and expressed his wish to
become a monk. Initially, Ryōken advised him to reconsider because his
father and foster father would be furious, but when Dōgen stated his
solid determination based on his mother's death and her wish for him,
Ryōken accepted his nephew's request. Ryōken sent him to a subtemple
called Senkō-bō ([千光房]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) in Yokawa
([横川]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) on Mt. Hiei. The next year, 1213,
Dōgen received the bodhisattva precepts and became a Tendai monk. The
preceptor was Kōen ([公圓]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; n.d.), the abbot of
Enryaku-ji ([延暦寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), []{#calibre_link-1128
.calibre2}the head temple of the Tendai sect and a highly significant
temple in Japanese Buddhist history.

Aspects of Dōgen's life prior to leaving home are touched on in
[Zuimonki]{.italice}. For example, he says that he loved reading Chinese
classics (3-6, 3-9, 5-8) and that he once owned property and other
capital (4-7). It is possible he used this wealth to fund his later
journey to China. At any rate, we can plainly see that his family was
wealthy and that he received the best education that medieval Japan had
to offer.

### [As a Tendai Monk]{.semiboldcapse} {#as-a-tendai-monk .head}

While he was staying at the monastery on Mt. Hiei, Dōgen studied Tendai
teachings, practiced meditation called [shikan]{.italice}
([止観]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [zhǐdàng]{.italice}; a translation
of Skt. [śamatha]{.italice} and [vipaśyanā]{.italice}; literally,
"concentration and insight"), and possibly also studied Esoteric
Buddhism ([密教]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. Mìjiào; Jp. Mikkyō).
However, within a few years he was disillusioned with what he felt were
the degenerate conditions at the monastery.

In section 5-7 of [Zuimonki]{.italice}, Dōgen states that his teachers
taught him to study hard to become a well-known teacher so that he could
gain fame and profit and ultimately become a teacher to the emperor or
other aristocrats. He later read the biographies of eminent monks in
ancient China and found that it was deeply mistaken to study Buddhist
teaching for the sake of gaining fame and profit. Not only that, on Mt.
Hiei there were even soldier monks engaged in fighting with other
powerful monasteries, such as Mii-dera ([三井寺]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) and Kōfuku-ji ([興福寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). Such
was the state of the Buddhist institution on Mt. Hiei during Dōgen's
youth. The genuine spirit of the founder of the monastery, Saichō
([最澄]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 767--822 CE), had been lost, and many
sincere practitioners left to find their own way of practice. Such monks
were called renunciants, or [tonsei-sō]{.italice} ([遁世僧]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), literally, "monks who escape from the world." This
originally referred simply to those who had renounced a normal life to
become monks and enter a monastery. However, in Dōgen's time the
Buddhist establishment of the Tendai, Shingon, and Nara schools was
supported by the government, []{#calibre_link-1164 .calibre2}the
emperor, and powerful noblemen. It was thus closely connected with the
political and economic power of the secular world. Therefore, when monks
of this time sincerely aroused the mind of awakening, they often felt
they had to leave the monastery. There were many such "renunciants"
between the end of the Heian era (1185 CE) and the end of the Kamakura
era (1333 CE), including Hōnen ([法然]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
1133--1212 CE), Shinran ([親鸞]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1173--1263
CE), Ippen ([一遍]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1234--1289 CE), and
Nichiren ([日蓮]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1222--1282 CE). They were the
driving force that established what scholars call the Kamakura New
Buddhism ([鎌倉新仏教]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Kamakura
Shinbukkyō). The schools they established became some of the largest
Buddhist denominations in Japan today. Dōgen and Ejō were also examples
of such monks. (See sections 2-15, 3-9, 3-10, 3-12, 4-10, 5-11, and
6-21.)

Not only was Dōgen disappointed by the degenerate conditions at the
monastery, but, according to his biographers, he also had serious
questions regarding teaching and practice. [The Record of the Deeds
of]{.italice} [the Three Great Venerable Masters]{.italice} and [The
Record of the]{.italice} [Deeds of the Three Ancestors of
Eihei-ji]{.italice} both quote Dōgen as saying:

::: block
The great matter of our \[Tendai\] school, which is the essence of the
dharma gates, is that \[all living beings\] are originally endowed with
the true dharma nature, \[and therefore\] we are the embodiment of the
innate self-nature. Both exoteric and esoteric schools do not differ
from this. \[If so,\] why did all buddhas have to arouse the mind of
awakening and practice?^[3](#calibre_link-25){#calibre_link-497
.calibre13}^
:::

Dōgen visited many teachers to find the answer to this question and to
discover someone with whom he could engage in genuine practice. One of
the teachers he visited was Kōin ([公胤]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
1145\[?\]--1216 CE) at Mii-dera ([三井寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; also
called Onjō-ji, [園城寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), a Tendai monastery
near Mt. Hiei that competed with Enryaku-ji for supremacy within the
school. In section 3-5 of [Zuimonki]{.italice}, Dōgen talks about an
admonition he received from Kōin to settle down and study further rather
than wandering around in Japan to find a teacher who could give him the
answer.^[4](#calibre_link-26){#calibre_link-498 .calibre13}^
[]{#calibre_link-1178 .calibre2}Perhaps as a result, Dōgen remained at
Enryaku-ji until he was seventeen.

### [Zen Practice at Kennin-ji]{.semiboldcapse} {#zen-practice-at-kennin-ji .head}

Although Dōgen was not happy on Mt. Hiei and sought an alternative place
to practice, he ended up staying at the Tendai monastery for five years.
Then, at the age of seventeen, he finally left Mt. Hiei and began to
practice Zen with Myōzen ([明全]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1184--1225
CE) at Kennin-ji ([建仁寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). Myōzen was a
student of Eisai ([栄西]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1141--1215 CE), the
first to bring Rinzai Zen to Japan, and his temple Kennin-ji---although
officially part of the Tendai institution---is considered to have been
the first Zen monastery in the country. Dōgen practiced with Myōzen at
Kennin-ji for six years, from 1217 to 1223. They both decided they
should go to Song dynasty China in order to study genuine Chinese Zen.
In section 6-13, Dōgen discusses Myōzen's resolution to go to China
despite the fact that his first master, Myōyu ([明融]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; n.d.), was on his deathbed and had requested that Myōzen
stay with him until his death.

Menzan's [Revised and Annotated Record of Kenzei]{.italice} states that
Dōgen left for Kennin-ji three years earlier, in 1214, and practiced
with Eisai until Eisai's death in 1215, only after which did Dōgen begin
to practice with Eisai's disciple Myōzen. However, many of today's Dōgen
scholars doubt that Dōgen studied with Eisai. Although it might have
been possible for Dōgen to have met Eisai while he was visiting teachers
in search of answers, it is difficult for me to believe that Dōgen had
moved to Kennin-ji before 1215. It is clear from Dōgen's writings that
he had gained an extensive knowledge and deep understanding of Tendai
teachings and the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice} ([法華経]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}, Jp. [Hokke kyō]{.italice}), and it is therefore hard to
imagine that he studied Tendai for only one or two years. Furthermore,
scholars now believe that Edo-era Sōtō historians simply wanted to
connect Eisai and Dōgen in order to exalt Dōgen's career. Although Dōgen
talks of Eisai with great respect quite a few times in
[Zuimonki]{.italice},^[5](#calibre_link-27){#calibre_link-499
.calibre13}^ these passages could just as easily be based on what he had
heard from others, including Myōzen, while practicing at Kennin-ji.

[]{#calibre_link-1017 .calibre2}

### [Practice in China]{.semiboldcapse} {#practice-in-china .head}

After a difficult voyage alluded to in section 6-16, Myōzen and Dōgen
arrived in China in the fourth month of the Chinese calendar of 1223.
Although Myōzen immediately started to practice at a Chinese monastery,
Dōgen had to stay on the boat for three months. This may have been
because he had not received the Vinaya precepts, which were normally
required in order to enter a Chinese monastery, but there is no direct
evidence for the cause of his delay. While he was staying there, he met
the monk serving as the head cook ([典座]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[diǎnzuò]{.italice}; Jp. [tenzo]{.italice}), who was from Ayuwang Temple
([阿育王寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Aikuō[-]{.italice}ji) in
Ningbo. They shared an important conversation that influenced Dōgen's
understanding of the meaning of practice. Dōgen describes this encounter
in [Instructions for the Cook]{.italice} ([典座教訓]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Tenzo kyōkun]{.italice}).

After the summer practice period ended in the seventh month of the
Chinese calendar of the same year, Dōgen finally began to practice with
Myōzen at a monastery on Mt. Tiantong ([天童山]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Tendō san), located in what is now the city of
Ningbo, just south of Shanghai. The abbot of the monastery was a Rinzai
master named Wuchi Liaopai ([無際了派]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
Musai Ryōha; 1149--1224 CE). The abbot died a year or so after Dōgen's
arrival. There is no clear evidence if Dōgen left before the abbot's
death or in response to it, but around this time Dōgen began to travel,
visiting several monasteries^[6](#calibre_link-28){#calibre_link-500
.calibre13}^ in search of a suitable teacher, but it seems he was not
happy with any of the abbots he encountered. However, he did meet
several practitioners that inspired him whom he did not name, such as
the two cooks he discusses in [Instructions]{.italice} [for the
Tenzo]{.italice}. He talks about his encounters with other genuine
people of the Way in [Zuimonki]{.italice}---for example, in sections
1-4, 3-7, and 6-2.

By the fifth month of the Chinese lunar calendar of 1225, Dōgen had
returned to Tiantong monastery. Shortly after his return, Myōzen---who
had stayed behind at Tiantong during Dōgen's travels---died
unexpectedly. Soon after he lost his Japanese teacher, Dōgen met the new
abbot of the monastery, Rujing ([如浄]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
Nyojō), and found that this master was the true teacher he had been
looking for. []{#calibre_link-1175 .calibre2}From that point, he studied
and practiced with Rujing until receiving Dharma transmission from him
in 1227. Dōgen discusses his experiences with Rujing several times in
[Zuimonki]{.italice}, such as in sections 1-1, 2-5, 2-11, and 3-19.
Dōgen also recorded his personal conversations with Rujing in what came
to be known as [The Record of the Hōkyō Era]{.italice}
([宝慶記]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Hōkyō ki]{.italice}). After
receiving Dharma transmission, Dōgen returned to Japan. Shortly after
Dōgen's departure, Rujing passed away.

### [Returning to Kennin-ji]{.semiboldcapse} {#returning-to-kennin-ji .head}

Dōgen returned to Kennin-ji with the relics of his deceased teacher
Myōzen. He wrote about Myōzen's life and his death in China in the text
the [Record of the Transmission of the Relics]{.italice}
([舎利相伝記]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[Sharisōdenk]{.italice}[i]{.italice}).^[7](#calibre_link-29){#calibre_link-501
.calibre13}^ In the same year, he likely wrote the first version of "The
Universal Recommendation of Zazen" ([普勧坐禅儀]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Fukanzazengi"), a short manual of zazen practice.
During his second stay at Kennin-ji, Dōgen observed that the atmosphere
had changed from the time before Myōzen and he had left for China. He
mentions that the monks had lost their genuine spirit of practice in the
period after Eisai's death, which Dōgen discusses in sections 2-14, 4-4,
and 5-8. Such conditions were one of the reasons he would ultimately
leave Kennin-ji.

According to the section on Ejō in Keizan's [Record of the Transmission
of]{.italice} [the Light]{.italice}, Dōgen was visited by his future
successor, Ejō, while staying at Kennin-ji. Ejō hoped to learn what had
been transmitted to Dōgen during his time in China. After several days
of discussion, Ejō decided he wanted to become Dōgen's disciple, but
Dōgen asked him to wait until he could establish his own monastery. I
will discuss this encounter in further detail in the later section on
Ejō's life.

### [Solitude in Fukakusa]{.semiboldcapse} {#solitude-in-fukakusa .head}

In 1230, Dōgen left Kennin-ji and began staying at a hermitage in
Fukakusa ([深草]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). Although today Fukakusa is a
part of the city of Kyoto, in the thirteenth century it was well outside
of the city limits. While living there alone, or possibly with a few
attendants, []{#calibre_link-960 .calibre2}Dōgen wrote his
[Talk]{.italice} [on the Wholehearted Practice of the Way]{.italice}
([辨道話]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Bendōwa]{.italice}) to express
his understanding of zazen practice in which we do not seek to attain
anything but simply participate in Buddha's awakening. He also answers
some of the questions about Zen practice that he imagined people at his
time might have had.

### [Kōshō-ji]{.semiboldcapse} {#kōshō-ji .head}

In 1233, Dōgen began to establish the monastery Kōshōhōrin-ji
([興聖法林寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) in Fukakusa, more commonly known
by its abbreviated name Kōshō-ji. During the first summer practice
period there, he wrote the "Great Perfection of Wisdom"
([摩訶般若波羅蜜]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Maka hannya
haramitsu")[,]{.italice} which later became the second fascicle of the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}. In the autumn of the same year, he wrote
"Genjōkōan" ([現成公按]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) and presented it to a
layperson. Ejō joined Dōgen's monastery in the winter of 1234 and began
to record Dōgen's informal talks. His compilation of these records later
became what we now call [Shōbōgenzō zuimonki]{.italice}.

## [E[JŌ'S]{.small} L[IFE]{.small}]{.semiboldcapse} {#ejōs-life .head}

### [Ejō's Biography]{.semiboldcapse} {#ejōs-biography .head1}

Biographies of Ejō are found in [The Record of the Deeds of the Three
Great Venerable]{.italice} [Masters]{.italice}, [The Record of the Deeds
of the Three Ancestors]{.italice} [of Eihei-ji]{.italice}, and a section
about him in the [Record of the Transmission of the Light]{.italice}.
According to these texts, Ejō was born in Kyoto into a branch of the
powerful Fujiwara clan ([藤原氏]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) in 1198 CE,
two years before Dōgen was born. He entered Enryaku-ji on Mt. Hiei when
he was young and was ordained by Ennō ([圓能]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
n.d.) in 1218. In Enryaku-ji, he studied basic Buddhist works such as
the [Abhidharma Storehouse Treatise]{.italice} and [The Treatise That
Accomplishes Reality]{.italice} ([成實論]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[Chéngshí lùn]{.italice}; Jp. [Jōjitsu ron]{.italice}; Skt.
[Tattvasiddhi-śāstra]{.italice}). He later studied Tendai teachings,
such as the [Great Cessation and Contemplation]{.italice}
([摩訶止觀]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [Móhē zhǐguān]{.italice}; Jp.
[Maka shikan]{.italice}) of Zhiyi ([智顗]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
Chigi; 538--597 CE). When the sincere mind of awakening developed in
Ejō, he wished to leave the Tendai monastery like many other sincere
monks had, but on the basis of []{#calibre_link-1156 .calibre2}his
teacher's advice, he hesitated. He is said to have later visited his
mother, who admonished him not to become a high-ranking monk, telling
him to instead aim to become a genuine practitioner. Upon hearing his
mother's words, he decided not to return to Mt. Hiei.

After leaving, Ejō studied Pure Land Buddhism with Shōku
([証空]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1177--1247 CE), a disciple of Hōnen,
the founder of the Pure Land school ([浄土宗]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. Jōdo shū) in Japan. Ejō later moved on and began practicing Zen with
Bucchi Kakuan ([仏地覚晏]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; n.d.), a disciple of
Dainichi Nōnin ([大日能忍]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; n.d.), the founder
of the Japanese Daruma school ([日本達磨宗]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. Nihon Daruma shū), the earliest school of Zen in Japan (but of
questionable credentials). Their practice was aimed at Rinzai-style
[kenshō]{.italice} ([見性]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), in which one has a
sort of preliminary awakening experience. According to the [Record of
the Transmission of the]{.italice} [Light]{.italice}, while practicing
with Ejō at Tonomine ([多武]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; in modern Nara
Prefecture, about eighty kilometers \[almost fifty miles\] south of
Kyoto), Kakuan gave talks on the [Śūraṅgama Sūtra]{.italice}
([大佛頂首楞嚴經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [Dà fódǐng shǒulèngyán
jīng]{.italice}; Jp. [Dai butchō shuryōgon kyō]{.italice}). When Kakuan
mentioned a metaphor from that text in which the emptiness of
consciousness is compared to the empty space of a particular
pitcher---as well as the phrase "adding emptiness does not increase
emptiness, and taking out emptiness does not decrease emptiness"---Ejō
was said to have been awakened. It is important to note, however, that
the [Record of the]{.italice} [Transmission of the Light]{.italice}
provides an awakening story for every person for which a biography is
provided. Because of the formulaic nature of this text, the historicity
of these accounts of awakening is somewhat dubious.

### [Ejō's First Meeting with Dōgen]{.semiboldcapse} {#ejōs-first-meeting-with-dōgen .head}

Keizan's [Record of the Transmission of]{.italice} [the Light]{.italice}
gives an account of the first encounter between Dōgen and Ejō. In 1227,
Ejō heard that Dōgen had come back from China intending to transmit
Chinese Zen. Ejō thought to himself, "I have already clarified the
essential teachings of the three cessations and three observations
([三止三観]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [sanshi]{.italice}
[sankan]{.italice}). I have also mastered the essential practice of the
Pure Land tradition. Not only that, I have practiced \[with Kakuan\] at
Tonomine and attained []{#calibre_link-1069 .calibre2}the meaning of
seeing nature and becoming buddha ([見性成佛]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. [kenshō jōbutsu]{.italice}). What else could \[Dōgen\] transmit from
China?"^[8](#calibre_link-30){#calibre_link-502 .calibre13}^

Despite his alleged skepticism, Ejō, the [Record of the Transmission of
the Light]{.italice} goes on to describe, visited Kennin-ji where he met
Dōgen to see what he could learn from him. In the first few days, they
talked about the matter of [kenshō]{.italice} and spiritual intelligence
([見性霊知]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [kenshō reichi]{.italice}),
which is what Ejō is supposed to have attained in his awakening
experience. Because at first Dōgen did not challenge Ejō's attainment,
Ejō was delighted and thought that what he had realized was genuine.
After a while, probably because Dōgen saw that Ejō was a sincere
practitioner, Dōgen began to discuss his own understanding of practice,
which differed from Ejō's [kenshō]{.italice}-based practice. Ejō was
astonished to learn there was more to practice than he had realized.
Despite his attempts to counterargue, Ejō understood that Dōgen's
insight was completely different from and superior to his own. He
aroused the mind of awakening anew and asked Dōgen if he could become
his disciple. However, Dōgen rejected his request, saying, "I wish to
spread the true Dharma I have transmitted \[from Rujing\] throughout
Japan, and yet I am temporarily living in this temple \[Kennin-ji\]. I
would like to found my own practice place. When I find a place to build
a grass hermitage, you can come. You cannot practice with me
here."^[9](#calibre_link-31){#calibre_link-503 .calibre13}^ Ejō accepted
Dōgen's advice and waited for the proper time.

Dōyū Takeuchi ([竹内道雄]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), a modern biographer
of Ejō, suggests that the question-and-answer section in Dōgen's [Talk
on the Wholehearted Practice of the Way]{.italice} could be based on
this discussion with Ejō.^[10](#calibre_link-32){#calibre_link-504
.calibre13}^ In particular, the view of a permanent mind-nature
([心性]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [xīnxìng]{.italice}; Jp.
[shinshō]{.italice}) expressed in question ten, which was Ejō's view at
the time, was criticized by Dōgen in their first meeting, according to
the [Record of the Transmission of the Light]{.italice}. In Dōgen's
[Talk on the Wholehearted Practice of the Way]{.italice}, this view
states: "If you really understand that the mind nature existing in our
body is not subject to birth and death, then since it is the original
nature, although the body is only a temporary form haphazardly born here
and dying, the mind is permanent and []{#calibre_link-1119
.calibre2}unchangeable in the past, present, and future. To know this is
called release from life and
death."^[11](#calibre_link-33){#calibre_link-505 .calibre13}^

In the "Talk on the Wholehearted Practice of the Way," Dōgen said such a
view is not consistent with the Buddha's teachings at all but rather
representative of the fallacious views of the non-Buddhist Senika.
Senika is mentioned in a section of the [Nirvana Sutra]{.italice}
([大般涅槃經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [Dà bānnièpán
jīng]{.italice}; Jp. [Dai hatsunehan gyō]{.italice}; Skt.
[Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra]{.italice}) that tries to distinguish
Buddha-nature and the Brahmanist concept of ātman. There is no direct
evidence that Takeuchi's suggestion is correct, but it is true that
Dōgen consistently criticized Zen practice centered on attaining
[kenshō]{.italice} experiences. According to [The Record of the Hōkyō
Era]{.italice} and [Dōgen']{.italice}[s Extensive Record]{.italice}
([永平広録]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Eihei
kōroku]{.italice}),^[12](#calibre_link-34){#calibre_link-506
.calibre13}^ Dōgen did not like this form of practice based on the idea
of a permanent mind-nature as discussed in the [Śūraṅgama]{.italice}
[Sūtra]{.italice}. Shortly before his death, Rujing had told Dōgen that
the [Śūraṅgama Sūtra]{.italice} was not a genuine scripture (which is
the opinion of most modern scholars as well).

When Ejō found what Dōgen said to be superior to his own understanding
and he decided to become Dōgen's disciple, I am sure he must have felt
the need to thoroughly deconstruct and reconstruct his understanding of
Zen Buddhist teachings. It may have been this need that led Ejō to
record Dōgen's informal Dharma talks for his first three years at
Kōshō-ji.

### [Becoming Dōgen's Disciple at Kōshō-ji]{.semiboldcapse} {#becoming-dōgens-disciple-at-kōshō-ji .head}

Dōgen first established Kōshō-ji monastery in 1233. Ejō joined the
sangha in 1234 and began recording Dōgen's informal talks that year. He
continued to do so until 1238. During this period, Ejō received the
bodhisattva precepts (in 1235); assisted Dōgen with fundraising and the
construction of a monks' hall ([僧堂]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[sōdō]{.italice}); received Dharma transmission; and was appointed the
first head monk ([首座]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[shuso]{.italice}), in 1236, for the new monks' hall. He ceased
recording Dōgen's informal talks in 1238, perhaps because he felt that
he had completely become Dōgen's disciple and thoroughly shared his
understanding and practice. []{#calibre_link-1172 .calibre2}At the same
time, the Kōshō-ji sangha had developed significantly, and Ejō would
have been exceptionally busy with administration and the copying of
Dōgen's writings of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}.

### [The Remainder of Ejō's Life]{.semiboldcapse} {#the-remainder-of-ejōs-life .head}

After [Zuimonki]{.italice} had been recorded, Dōgen and his sangha moved
to Echizen Province ([越前国]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) to establish
Eihei-ji. According to the [Record of the Transmission of the]{.italice}
[Lamp]{.italice}, at a certain point Dōgen had Ejō officiate ceremonies
in his place. When asked why, he replied, "My life will not be long. You
will live longer than I and surely will propagate my Way. Therefore, I
value you for the sake of the Dharma." Until Dōgen's death in 1253, Ejō
served as his personal attendant ([侍者]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[jisha]{.italice}) even while he was holding other positions.

After Dōgen's death in 1253, Ejō became Eihei-ji's second abbot. He
continued to copy Dōgen's manuscripts of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}, and
he compiled volumes 2, 3, 4, and 8 of [Dōgen's Extensive
Record]{.italice}, among other works. He devoted his life to maintaining
Dōgen's legacy, including not only his teachings but also his style of
practice and lineage, until his own death in 1280. Ejō's only writing
was the [Treasury of the Samadhi of Radiant Light]{.italice}
([光明]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"} [藏三昧]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[Kōmyōzō Zanmai]{.italice}), written when he was eighty years old. It
has not yet been published in an English
translation.^[13](#calibre_link-35){#calibre_link-507 .calibre13}^

## [M[AIN]{.small} T[OPICS OF]{.small} D[ŌGEN'S]{.small} T[ALKS IN]{.small} [Z[UIMONKI]{.small}]{.bolditaliccapse}]{.semiboldcapse} {#main-topics-of-dōgens-talks-in-zuimonki .head}

Fundamentally, [Zuimonki]{.italice} can be read as a highly practical
manual of Buddhist practice. Dōgen's words express fundamental aspects
of Buddhist practice in terms that are both concrete and straightforward
in Japanese society in the thirteenth century. Among the many topics
covered, Dōgen especially emphasizes the following points: seeing
impermanence; departing from the ego-centered self; being free from
greed; giving up self-attachment; following the guidance of a true
teacher; and following the practice of zazen, specifically
[shikantaza]{.italice} ([只管打坐]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), or "just
sitting."

[]{#calibre_link-979 .calibre2}

By and large, these points are the fundamentals of Buddhist teaching.
For example, one way Buddhist teachings have been summarized is in the
form of the four Dharma seals ([四法印]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[sì fǎyìn]{.italice}; Jp. [shi hōin]{.italice}). "Seal" here is used in
the sense of a stamp that leaves an imprint and certifies something as
genuine, as in a "seal of authenticity." In the same way, if we find
these four points in a given teaching, we can be sure the teaching is
Buddhist. The four Dharma seals are the following: (1) All conditioned
things are impermanent (Skt. [anitya]{.italice}); (2) all defiled things
are suffering (Skt. [duḥkha]{.italice}); (3) all things are without
permanent self (Skt. [anātman]{.italice}); and (4) nirvana is peace.

To me, these are not four separate items but rather one unified message
from the Buddha. Impermanence and no-self are the true reality of all
things. When we are blind to these truths and live based on the ideas of
permanence and a fixed, independent self, everything in our lives
becomes suffering. However, when we instead awaken to this true reality,
our lives become nirvana.

A different and more well-known way of summarizing Buddhism is the
doctrine of the four noble truths ([四諦]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[sìdì]{.italice}; Jp. [shitai]{.italice}; Skt. [catvāri
āryasatyāni]{.italice}). These are (1) suffering (Skt.
[duḥkha]{.italice}); (2) the cause or origination of suffering (Skt.
[samudaya]{.italice}); (3) the cessation of suffering (Skt.
[nirodha]{.italice}); and (4) the path leading to cessation of suffering
(Skt. [mārga]{.italice}). The "path" refers to the eightfold correct
path, which includes right view, right intention, right speech, right
conduct, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right
concentration.

Both summaries cover the same things. The cause of suffering is delusion
and the delusive desires of the three poisons of greed, anger, and
ignorance. Suffering ends when we instead practice correctly and see the
truth. Now, compare the two methods of summarizing Buddhism to the
following passage from section 2-2 of [Zuimonki]{.italice}:

::: block
To maintain the way \[of Buddhist monks\] is to give up self-attachment
and follow the guidance of our teachers. The essential point here is to
be free from greed. If we wish to put an end to greed, we must first
depart from our ego-centered self. []{#calibre_link-983 .calibre2}To
depart from the ego-centered self, seeing impermanence is the primary
concern. . . .

For a Zen monk to make progress, the most important thing to keep in
mind is that we must just sit \[[shikantaza]{.italice}\]. Whether we are
sharp or dull-witted, wise or foolish, if we practice zazen, we will
naturally improve.
:::

When we read this passage with these basic teachings in mind, we can see
the similarity between them and Dōgen's words. We must give up the
delusions of self-attachment, as these are the source of suffering, and
accept impermanence. In order to let go of the delusive worldview, we
should practice zazen so that we can see true reality.

I first read [Zuimonki]{.italice} when I was a high-school student,
shortly after reading a book by Kōshō Uchiyama Rōshi called
[Jiko]{.italice} ([自己]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; meaning
"self").^[14](#calibre_link-36){#calibre_link-508 .calibre13}^ I was
trying to understand if there was an alternative to the common Japanese
way of life at that time, namely the pursuit of money and social status.
I was therefore inspired to learn about Uchiyama's wholehearted practice
of zazen at his temple, Antai-ji ([安]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}[泰寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), and the fact that he
supported his life by begging ([托鉢]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[takuhatsu]{.italice}). Although I did not understand any Buddhist
philosophy at that point, I was encouraged by Dōgen's talks on concrete
topics such as living in pure poverty without being pulled by desires
for fame and profit. My favorite conversation between Dōgen and Ejō
comes at the conclusion of section 3-14:

::: block
\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Regarding the behavior of patch-robed practitioners, if we mend or patch
our old, tattered clothing instead of discarding it, it seems that we
are clinging to things. Yet to abandon old clothing and wear new robes
shows that we are seeking after new things. Both of these are mistakes.
What should we do?

I, \[Ejō,\] asked, "Ultimately, what should we keep in mind?"

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [replied]{.italice}:

[]{#calibre_link-1018 .calibre2}

So long as we are free from both greedy clinging and greedy seeking,
either is fine. Still, it would be better to mend torn clothing in order
to keep it as long as possible and not lust after new clothing.
:::

In the Chōen-ji version of the text, which I translate here, Dōgen first
gives instruction to his students in the form of a question. After
hearing it, Ejō poses the question back at Dōgen, indicating that
perhaps no one had a good answer, and Dōgen then gives his reply. In
Menzan's version, the entirety of the first part before "Dōgen replied"
is Ejō's question. The opinions of scholars are divided on who was
actually speaking which lines in the original version of the text, which
is now lost. Yaoko Mizuno ([水野弥穂子]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), a
scholar of literature and a translator of Dōgen into modern Japanese,
believes the first part before Ejō's question is Dōgen's question to
Ejō, as in the Chōen-ji version translated
here.^[15](#calibre_link-37){#calibre_link-509 .calibre13}^ Ryūshin
Azuma ([東隆真]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"})^[16](#calibre_link-38){#calibre_link-510 .calibre13}^ and
Rosan Ikeda ([池田魯参]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}),^[17](#calibre_link-39){#calibre_link-511 .calibre13}^
two important Sōtō scholar-priests, follow Menzan's version. I will
discuss further differences between the Chōen-ji and Menzan versions of
the text in the next section.

Dōgen and Ejō were both from aristocratic families. They were also both
brilliant people. If they had not become Buddhist monks, they could have
easily been high-ranking court officials. If they had not left the
monastery on Mt. Hiei, they could have also been high-ranking monks
within the Tendai hierarchy. If they had not chosen to become
"renunciants" from the Buddhist establishment, they would not have
needed to worry about the question of repairing or replacing old robes.
Because they left both their homes and their religious institution in
order to seek the genuine Way of the Buddha, they lived in poverty,
continuing their practice without worrying about the pursuit of material
things. I was saved when I learned not only that such people could be
found in Japanese history but also that their traditions had continued
down to the present through the way of life of Uchiyama Rōshi as well as
that of his teacher, Kōdō Sawaki Rōshi ([沢]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}[木興道]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1880--1965).

One of the characteristics of Japanese Buddhism in Dōgen's time, the
so-called Kamakura New Buddhism, was that the leading teachers selected
one particular practice and focused on it largely to the exclusion of
others. Pure Land Buddhists such as Hōnen and Shinran practiced only
chanting the name of Amitābha Buddha ([念佛]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Ch. [niànfó]{.italice}; Jp. [nenbutsu]{.italice}). Nichiren focused on
chanting the title of the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice} ([題目]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [daimoku]{.italice}). Dōgen chose the practice of
zazen, specifically "just sitting" ([shikantaza]{.italice}).

[]{#calibre_link-1152 .calibre2}

In short, seeing impermanence; arousing the mind of awakening; parting
from the egocentric self; practicing the Buddhadharma only for the sake
of Buddhadharma; concentrating on sitting zazen without thoughts of
gaining; living in poverty, free from desire; and working for the
benefit of others is the way of life Dōgen urged his disciples to follow
in [Zuimonki]{.italice}.

## [R[EGARDING THE]{.small} T[EXT]{.small}]{.semiboldcapse} {#regarding-the-text .head}

After Ejō stopped recording Dōgen's informal Dharma talks in 1238, he
apparently kept the text for his own private use with no intention to
publicize it. However, when Ejō died, one of his disciples found the
material and decided to compile and copy it. As it states in the
colophon at the conclusion of the text, the collection was given the
title [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} [zuimonki]{.italice} by that compiler after
Ejō's death. The manuscript was hand copied over many generations, but
Ejō's original manuscript has been lost. The oldest hand-copied
manuscript available today was produced some four hundred years after
Ejō's death. In the second half of the seventeenth century, the text was
published on a few occasions using woodblock printing, and the oldest
known printed version dates from 1651. It is unknown what manuscript (or
manuscripts) these printed versions were based on.

According to Menzan Zuihō, these woodblock printed versions were not
reviewed by an actual Zen monk, which resulted in numerous errors. When
Menzan was twenty-seven years old (around 1710 CE), he heard from an old
monk who said that while he had been practicing at Eihei-ji, he had once
read an old hand-copied manuscript of [Zuimonki]{.italice}. The monk
noted that there were many differences in the manuscript from the
woodblock published versions. Menzan was excited at the prospect of
studying this text, and he set out to locate it. Later, while Menzan was
at Daijō-ji ([大乘寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), the abbot there thought
he had the text, but they were unable to locate it. After more than ten
years, Menzan became the abbot of Kūin-ji ([空印寺]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) and learned that the text had, in fact, been in the
possession of Kuin-ji's previous []{#calibre_link-1131 .calibre2}abbot,
a disciple of the abbot of Daijō-ji. Comparing this hand-written
manuscript with woodblock printed versions, Menzan made corrections and
revisions and published his own version in 1770. Because Menzan was a
renowned scholar-monk, his version quickly became popular, and
consequently it is now called the "popular version" ([流布本]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [rufu bon]{.italice}).

In 1926, the famous scholar and philosopher Tetsurō Watsuji
([和辻哲郎]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1889--1960 CE) wrote an article
about Dōgen entitled "The Śramaṇa Dōgen" ([沙門道元]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Shamon
Dōgen"),^[18](#calibre_link-40){#calibre_link-512 .calibre13}^ which was
published in a collection of his essays entitled [A Study of]{.italice}
[the History of Japanese Spirituality]{.italice}
([日本精神史研究]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Nihon seishin
shi]{.italice} [kenkyū]{.italice}). This book greatly increased Dōgen's
popularity among Japanese intellectuals. Watsuji's study of Dōgen was
mostly based on [Zuimonki]{.italice}. In 1929, Menzan's version of
[Zuimonki]{.italice} was revised by Watsuji and published by Iwanami
Bunko ([岩波文庫]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), a publisher of classics
that uses an inexpensive format similar to American mass-market
paperbacks (and actually based on the German Universal-Bibliothek
paperback editions from Reclam Verlag). This version gained widespread
popularity, and many people outside of the Sōtō school began to read it,
as well as the other writings by Dōgen. When I was a university student,
I recall that this version of the text cost only fifty yen. I often
bought a copy, for example, when I took a train and wanted something to
read.

In 1941, the eminent Dōgen scholar Dōshū Ōkubo ([大久保道舟]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; 1896--1994 CE) found an older hand-copied version of
[Zuimonki]{.italice} at the temple Chōen-ji in Aichi Prefecture. This
manuscript was one copied by Kido Soe, the second abbot of Chōen-ji, in
1644, and the original manuscript from which it was copied came from
Hōkyō-ji monastery in Fukui and dates to 1380. The 1644 manuscript Ōkubo
discovered is referred to as the "Chōen-ji version"
([長円寺本]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Chōenji[-bon]{.italice}) after
the temple where it was discovered. The Chōen-ji version was published
in 1963 by Chikuma Shobō ([筑摩書房]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), a major
publisher of literature, with a modern Japanese translation and many
footnotes by Yaoko Mizuno. Today, scholars believe the Chōen-ji version
is closer to Ejō's original manuscript.

[]{#calibre_link-1019 .calibre2}

I previously translated Menzan's version of [Zuimonki]{.italice} into
English. This was first published by Sōtōshū Shūmuchō
([曹洞宗宗務庁]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) in 1988, and the translation
is still available from Sōtōshū Shūmuchō for free. This new translation
is instead based on the Chōen-ji version.

The main differences between Menzan's version and the Chōen-ji version
are the following:

[1. ]{.nspa}Although both versions comprise six books, the order is
different. Book 6 of Menzan's version is book 1 of the Chōen-ji version.
As a result, book 1 of Menzan's version is book 2 of the Chōen-ji
version, and so on, until book 5 of Menzan's version takes the place of
book 6 in the Chōen-ji version.

[2. ]{.nspa}In section 1-3 of Menzan's version, there is a story of a
Chinese Zen master, Fozhao Deguang ([佛照徳光]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. Busshō Tokkō; 1121--1203 CE), who allowed a sick monk to eat meat.
This section does not appear in the Chōen-ji version.

[3. ]{.nspa}In section 6-19 of the Chōen-ji version, Dōgen speaks on a
quotation from the Confucian classic [The]{.italice} [Spring and Autumn
Annals]{.italice} ([春秋]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[Chūnqiū]{.italice}; Jp. [Shunjū]{.italice}) along with a saying of Zen
Master Xuansha Shibei ([玄沙師備]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Gensha
Shibi; 835--908 CE). This section is not present in Menzan's version.

There are many other minor differences, but most of them do not come
through in an English translation. Important differences, however, are
mentioned in the notes.

## [T[EXTUAL]{.small} S[OURCES AND]{.small} A[CKNOWLEDGMENTS]{.small}]{.semiboldcapse} {#textual-sources-and-acknowledgments .head}

The source text for this translation was from Ryūshin Azuma's study of
the [Shōbōgenzō zuimonki]{.italice}, as found in volume 16 of [Dōgen
Zenji zenshū]{.italice} ([道元禅師全集]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}).
Azuma's work reproduces the original text, provides a modern Japanese
translation, and gives extensive commentary. Ryūshin Azuma was a
scholar-monk and the abbot of Daijō-ji ([大乗寺]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), an important Sōtō Zen temple in Kanazawa.
[]{#calibre_link-1020 .calibre2}I also frequently referred to two other
Japanese translation-commentaries on the Chōen-ji text, namely Yaoko
Mizuno's [Shōbōgenzō zuimonki]{.italice} and Rosan Ikeda's [Gendaigoyaku
shōbōgenzō zuimonki]{.italice}. When trying to understand difficult
passages of the text, I found that the comments and interpretations of
all three authors were indispensable. When I had a question about
disagreements between their versions, I checked a facsimile of the
original Chōen-ji manuscript published by Ikudō Tajima
([田島毓堂]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) and Yōko Kondō
([近藤洋子]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) in [Shōbōgenzō zuimonki goi
sōsakuin]{.italice}. While working on this translation, I also often
referred to the existing English translations. These include Professor
Reihō Masunaga's ([増永霊鳳]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) [A Primer of
Sōtō]{.italice} [Zen: A Translation of Dōgen's Shōbōgenzō
Zuimonki]{.italice} and Thomas Cleary's [Record of Things Heard: From
the Treasury of]{.italice} [the Eye of the True Teaching]{.italice}.

The Japanese text of [Zuimonki]{.italice} from Azuma's study is also
reproduced in this book. I deviated from Azuma's presentation of the
text occasionally when I found the text by Mizuno or Ikeda to be more
compelling or a better match with the facsimile of the original
manuscript provided by Tajima and Kondō. The original manuscript does
not include a numbering scheme for the books or sections, so I added
these based on Mizuno's and Ikeda's books. I hope that the inclusion of
the Japanese text will help those who are able to read some Japanese
gain a better understanding of Dōgen's writing.

I have studied [Zuimonki]{.italice} not only by reading the text itself
but also by reading a variety of Japanese books on the topic written by
various Dōgen scholars, Zen teachers, philosophers, and others. In
addition to the source texts previously mentioned, particular texts that
I found helpful included Tetsurō Watsuji's "The Śramaṇa Dōgen," Yaoko
Mizuno's [Shōbōgenzō zuimonki no sekai]{.italice}, Makoto Funaoka's
([船岡誠]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) [Dōgen to shōbōgenzō
zuimonki]{.italice}, and the compilation of essays compiled by Rosan
Ikeda entitled [Shōbōgenzō zuimonki no kenkyū]{.italice}. I would like
to express my deepest gratitude to all of these people for their efforts
in studying [Zuimonki]{.italice} or translating it into English.

I made the first drafts of this translation for the Dharma study group
at my home temple, Sanshin-ji in Bloomington, Indiana,
[]{#calibre_link-1249 .calibre2}from May 2014 to January 2017.
Participants of the study group made many corrections and suggestions in
order to improve the translation. During that time, regular participants
included Seigen Hartkemeyer, Rise Koben, and Dōju Layton. The head monks
([首座]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [shuso]{.italice}) for each summer
practice period during that time also participated in the study group
while at Sanshin-ji: they included Dōryū Cappelli (2014), Musō Jim Biggs
(2015), and Jōshū Judith Toland (2016). Without the interest and support
of the study group, this translation would not have been possible.
Shunryū Collin Garvey also made many useful suggestions in the process
of improving my translation. Finally, I would like to say thank you to
my disciple Dōju Layton, who edited this text in its entirety in order
to prepare it for publication.

If you must heed someone, you should heed those with clear eyes.

When I was in Song China, Preceptor

attendant,^[20](#calibre_link-43){#calibre_link-514 .calibre13}^ saying,
"Although Venerable Gen is a foreigner, he is a man of ability."

I firmly declined. The reason for this was that, although it was an
important opportunity to become well known in Japan and also for my own
practice of the Way, there might have been certain people endowed with
clear eyes who would have thought that appointing a foreigner as the
abbot's attendant in such a great monastery meant that \[Rujing
thought\] there were no capable people in his country. I had to be very
careful about this. I wrote what I thought to the abbot in a letter.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Sages of the past did not necessarily have golden bones; not all of the
ancients were superior vessels \[of the
Dharma\].^[24](#calibre_link-47){#calibre_link-518 .calibre13}^ If we
consider \[the period\] after \[Shakyamuni's\] death, not such a long
time has passed. Thinking of \[the people\] when \[Shakyamuni\] was in
the world, not everyone was endowed with natural talent. There were good
people as well as bad people. Among the monks, there were some who did
incredibly evil things, while others had the lowest of capabilities.
However, none of them demeaned themselves by failing to arouse the mind

If you do not study and practice the Way in this present lifetime, in

a person without sickness? Simply, do not be concerned with your
corporeal life, arouse the mind of awakening, and practice. This is what
is most essential in studying the Way.

more than your share, it will never come \[to you\]. Moreover, for those

[]{#calibre_link-1070 .calibre2}

In ancient times there was a certain monk. When he \[the monk\] died and
went to the underworld, King Yama said, "This person's allotted life has
not yet been exhausted. Let him return." One of the officers of the
world of the dead then said, "Although he has allotted life remaining,
his allotted food has already been consumed." The king said, "Then let
him eat lotus leaves." After the monk was brought back to life, he could
not eat ordinary food in the human realm, and he maintained his
remaining life eating only lotus
leaves.^[29](#calibre_link-52){#calibre_link-523 .calibre13}^

Therefore, because of the power of studying the Buddha Way, the food
allotted to home-leavers will not be exhausted. The single whorl of
white hair \[on the forehead of the Buddha\] and the blessing of the
Buddha leaving us twenty years of his life will never be exhausted, even
if we continue to receive it for numberless
eons.^[30](#calibre_link-53){#calibre_link-524 .calibre13}^ Devote
yourself only to the practice of the Way, and do not seek after food and
clothing.

We often read in books on medicine that only when the body, blood, and
flesh are well maintained will the mind also be healthy. All the more
will people who practice the Way, keep the precepts, uphold the pure
practices,^[31](#calibre_link-54){#calibre_link-525 .calibre13}^ and
entrust themselves to the activities of the buddhas and ancestors have
their minds likewise harmonized.

Students of the Way, when you want to say something, reflect on it three
times. If it is beneficial to both yourself and others, then say it. If
it is not beneficial, remain silent. This is difficult to achieve
immediately. Keep this in mind and gradually put it into practice.

Although this country is small and remote \[from the Buddha's country\],
among those who are famous in the ways of the exoteric and esoteric
teachings^[32](#calibre_link-55){#calibre_link-526 .calibre13}^ and are
known to later generations, whether in the past and present, I have
never heard of even one among them who had abundant food and clothing.
All of them became well known because they endured poverty, were not
concerned about other things, and devoted themselves completely to this
Way. Moreover, people studying the Way abandon their occupations in
society and never seek after \[fame and profit\]. How could they
possibly become wealthy?

Although we are in the final age \[of Dharma\], in the monasteries in
great Song China, there are thousands and thousands of people who are
studying the Way. There are some who have come from remote districts or
left their home provinces. Most of them are poor. However, they never
worry about \[food and clothing\]. Their only concern is that they have
not yet attained realization of the Way. Whether sitting in a lofty
tower or in a magnificent hall, they think of the Way \[with the
seriousness\] of having lost their father and mother.

I personally met a monk from Sichuan who had no possessions because he
had come from a remote
district.^[33](#calibre_link-56){#calibre_link-527 .calibre13}^ All he
had was two or three pieces of ink stick. They cost about two or three
hundred [wen]{.italice} in China, which is about twenty or thirty
[mon]{.italice} in this country. He sold them, bought some low-quality
Chinese paper that was very fragile, made an upper and lower robe with
it, and put them on. Although when he stood up or sat down, his robe
tore and made strange noises, he never paid any attention to it and was
not bothered. Someone said to him, "You should go back to your hometown
and bring some personal belongings and clothing." He replied, "My
hometown is far away. I do not want to waste time on the road and lose
time \[I could spend\] practicing the Way." He practiced the Way without
any concern for the cold. This is why many good monks have appeared in
China.

I have heard that at the time of the founding of the monastery on Mt.
Xuefeng, the temple was so poor they sometimes \[had no food to cook
such that\] no smoke came out \[of the kitchen chimney\], and sometimes
they had to eat weedy legumes steamed with
rice.^[34](#calibre_link-57){#calibre_link-528 .calibre13}^ They lived
such a poor life while practicing the Way, yet they always had fifteen
hundred monks. People in ancient times practiced in such a way. Today we
should also be like this.

The degeneration of monks is often caused by lives of wealth. In the
time of the Tathāgata, Devadatta became jealous once he began receiving
daily offerings of five hundred cartloads of provisions \[from King
Ajātaśatru\].^[35](#calibre_link-58){#calibre_link-529 .calibre13}^ Not
only was wealth harmful to him, but it caused other people to commit
evil deeds as well. How can people who truly study the Way become
wealthy? Even if a person makes an offering with pure faith, if the
offering is especially large, we see it as a debt of kindness and want
to repay it.

Also, people in this country make donations expecting some profit for
themselves. It is an unchanging principle that people give more to those
who approach with a flattering smile. If we do the same in order to
curry favor with others, it will surely become an obstacle to our
practice of the Way. Just endure hunger, bear the cold, and devote
yourselves completely to the practice of the Way.

[One day]{.italice} \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

An ancient said, "You must listen; you must see." He also said, "If you
have not experienced, you must look. If you have not seen, you must
listen." He meant that we should see rather than listen, and that we
should experience rather than see. If we have not experienced, we should
see. If we have not seen, we should listen.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

When practicing the Way, we must be cautious of our deep-rooted
attachments and cast them aside. If you change your physical behavior,
your mind will change as well.^[36](#calibre_link-59){#calibre_link-530
.calibre13}^ First of all, if you maintain activities according to the
precepts based on moral codes and forms, then your mind will also be
transformed.^[37](#calibre_link-60){#calibre_link-531 .calibre13}^ In
Song China, there is a custom among laypeople. They gather at their
ancestral shrine and pretend to cry in order to demonstrate their filial
piety toward their fathers and mothers. Eventually, they actually do
cry. Students of the Way should do the same. Even if you do not have the
mind of awakening in the beginning, if you compel yourself to choose to
practice the Buddha Way wholeheartedly, eventually you will arouse the
true mind of awakening.^[38](#calibre_link-61){#calibre_link-532

Beginners in the Way should simply practice \[the Way\] following the
other members of the sangha. Do not seek to study in order to gain
\[extensive\] knowledge of the essential points and ancient
practices.^[39](#calibre_link-62){#calibre_link-533 .calibre13}^ When
you enter the mountains alone or seclude yourself in a city to practice,
it is good to understand the essential points and ancient practices
without misinterpretation. If you practice following other
practitioners, you will be able to attain the Way. For example, when it
comes to sailing a ship, if you do not know the ancient practices \[of
sailing\], or even if you do not know how to steer or how the boat
sails, if you entrust everything to good sailors, whether you understand
or not, you will reach the other shore. Only if you follow a good
teacher^[40](#calibre_link-63){#calibre_link-534 .calibre13}^ and
practice with fellow practitioners without harboring personal views will
you naturally become a person of the Way.

Students of the Way! Even if you have attained realization, do not think
that you have reached the pinnacle and stop practicing. The Way is
infinite. Even if you have attained realization, continue to practice
the Way. Remember the story of Liangsui who visited Zen Master
Magu.^[41](#calibre_link-64){#calibre_link-535 .calibre13}^

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Students of the Way! We should not think that we will practice the Way
on another day. Do not just spend this day or moment in vain; simply
practice diligently day by day, moment by moment. A certain layperson
had been sick for a long time. In the spring of last year, he pledged
himself to me, saying, "As soon as I have recovered from the sickness I
have now, I will renounce my wife and children and build a hermitage
near the temple. I will join the repentance
ceremony^[42](#calibre_link-65){#calibre_link-536 .calibre13}^ both
times each month. I will practice daily and listen to your lectures on
the Dharma. I would like to spend as much of the rest of my life as
possible keeping the precepts." After that, he received various medical
treatments and recovered a little bit. But then he relapsed and spent
his days in vain. In January of this year, his condition suddenly became
critical, and he suffered from increasing pain. Because he did not have
enough time to bring the furnishings he had been preparing, nor to build
the hermitage, he borrowed someone else's hut to stay in temporarily.
Within a month or so, however, he died. The night before \[he died\], he
received the bodhisattva precepts and took refuge in the Three
Treasures.^[43](#calibre_link-66){#calibre_link-537 .calibre13}^ He was
peaceful on his deathbed. It was better than staying at home and dying
in a frenzy, clinging to the bonds of affection for his wife and
children. However, I think it would have been better for him if he had
left home last year when he had first made up his mind, had lived close
to this temple, had become familiar with the sangha, and had ended his
life practicing the Way. Considering this case, I feel that we must not
defer the practice of the Buddha Way to another day.

If we think that because we are physically sick we will practice better
only after we have recovered from sickness, it only shows that we lack
the mind of awakening. Because this body is a collection of the four
gross elements,^[44](#calibre_link-67){#calibre_link-538 .calibre13}^
who will not become sick? The ancients did not necessarily have golden
bones. Only because their aspiration was sufficiently strong could they
practice, setting other things aside. We forget trivial matters when an
important matter comes up. We must consider the Buddha Way to be the
vital matter and be determined to investigate it thoroughly in this
lifetime, not wasting even a single day or hour.

An ancient once said, "Do not spend your days and nights in
vain."^[45](#calibre_link-68){#calibre_link-539 .calibre13}^ If we
receive medical treatments to heal a sickness, but instead of getting
better the pain gradually increases, we may think that we should have
practiced while the pain was still not so bad. However, when we are in
pain, we should be determined \[to practice\] before our condition
becomes critical. And when our condition has become critical, we should
resolve to practice before we die. When we are sick and receive
treatment, sometimes the illness passes, and sometimes it gets worse.
Sometimes we recover without having any treatment, and sometimes we get
worse even though we are being treated. Take this into careful
consideration.

Also, we should not think that we will practice only after shelter has
been arranged and robes, bowls, and so forth have been
obtained.^[46](#calibre_link-69){#calibre_link-540 .calibre13}^ If we
are living in poverty, we should not run around \[to make such
preparations\]. While waiting until robes, bowls, and other things have
been obtained, can we prevent death from approaching? If we wait until
furnishings are ready and our shelter has been prepared before beginning
to practice, we could spend our entire lifetimes in vain. Even if we do
not have robes, bowls, and so on, we should practice with the resolution
that even a layperson can practice the Buddha Way. Anyway, robes, bowls,
and other things are simply the ornaments of monkhood. The genuine
Buddha Way does not depend on such things. If they are available, we
should have them, but do not deliberately seek after them. \[At the same
time,\] we should not consider rejecting them when we can get them. It
is a non-Buddhist view to refuse medical treatments because of a desire
to die intentionally. In the Buddha Way it is said, "We should not
begrudge our lives; we should not fail to take care of our
lives."^[47](#calibre_link-70){#calibre_link-541 .calibre13}^ When
offered, moxibustion^[48](#calibre_link-71){#calibre_link-542
.calibre13}^ or purgatives will not obstruct our practice of the Way. It
is a hindrance to think that we must put aside our practice of the Way
and put primary importance on curing our sickness, planning to practice
only after we have recovered.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

In the ocean there is a place called the Dragon
Gate.^[49](#calibre_link-72){#calibre_link-543 .calibre13}^ \[Here\]
waves constantly billow. Once they have passed through the waves at this
place, all fish without exception become dragons. Therefore, this place
is called the Dragon Gate. Now I say, at this place the waves are not
different from those in any other place, and the water is also ordinary
saltwater. However, mysteriously enough, when fish pass through this
place, they become dragons without fail. Although their scales do not
change and their bodies stay the same, they suddenly become dragons. We
should know that the way of patch-robed monks is also like this.
Although it is similar to other places, if we enter a monastery, without
fail we will become buddhas and ancestors. We eat meals and wear clothes
just like other people; we satisfy our hunger and ward off the cold just
like other people. Still, if we simply shave our heads and reveal its
roundness, wear a square robe,^[50](#calibre_link-73){#calibre_link-544
.calibre13}^ and eat gruel for breakfast and rice for lunch, we
immediately become patch-robed monks. Becoming a buddha or an ancestor
should not be sought elsewhere far away. \[Becoming a buddha or an
ancestor\] depends only on whether or not we enter a monastery;
\[becoming a dragon\] depends only on whether or not fish pass through
the Dragon Gate.

Also, there is a saying in the lay world, "Although I sell gold, no one
buys it." The Way of the buddhas and ancestors is also like this. It is
not that they are stingy with the Way; rather, they always offer it, but
people do not accept it. Attaining the Way does not depend on whether
our faculties are sharp or dull. Every one of us can realize the Dharma.
Depending upon whether we are diligent or lazy, there is slowness or
quickness in attaining the Way. The difference between being diligent or
lazy is caused by whether our aspiration is firmly established or not.
Lack of firm aspiration is caused by not considering
impermanence.^[51](#calibre_link-74){#calibre_link-545 .calibre13}^ We
die moment by moment. Ultimately speaking, we do not stay \[alive\] even
for a little while. While you are alive, do not spend your time in vain.

There is a saying, "A mouse in a \[sealed\] granary is starved for food.
An ox plowing a field does not satisfy its hunger with grass." This
means that even though it is living in the midst of abundance, \[the
mouse\] does not necessarily eat its fill; even though it lives in the
midst of grass, \[the ox\] is hungry for grass. People are also like
this. Even though we are in the midst of the Buddha Way, we do not live
in peace and joy throughout our lifetime.

All the deeds of people of the Way, whether these actions seem good or

ordinary people. Long ago, the Director of Monks
Eshin^[52](#calibre_link-75){#calibre_link-546 .calibre13}^ once had
someone hit a deer that was eating grass in his garden to drive it away.
At the time, someone said to him, "Master, it seems you do not have
compassion. You begrudged the grass and tormented the animal." The
director of monks replied, "If I did not hit it, the deer would
eventually become accustomed to human beings. And when it came near an
evil person, it would surely be killed. This is why I had it hit."
Although it seems he did not have compassion and had the deer hit, deep
in his heart he was filled with compassion in this way.

When someone asks about the Dharma
gates^[53](#calibre_link-76){#calibre_link-547 .calibre13}^ or methods
of practice, patch-robed monks should without fail answer with the
genuine teachings. Even if you believe that the questioner is not a
vessel \[of the Dharma\], or is a beginner who has not yet entered \[the
Dharma\], and that therefore the person is not capable of grasping the
meaning \[of your words\], do not answer with expedient means that are
not genuine. In the spirit of the bodhisattva precepts, even if a vessel
of the Hīnayāna^[54](#calibre_link-77){#calibre_link-548 .calibre13}^
asks about the Hīnayāna way, we should reply with \[the heart\] of the
Mahāyāna. Among the teaching activities of the Tathāgata during his
lifetime, the provisional teachings as an expedient means \[, which he
expounded before he began to teach the genuine teachings,\] are not
truly beneficial. Only the final, genuine teaching is truly
beneficial.^[55](#calibre_link-78){#calibre_link-549 .calibre13}^
Therefore, without being concerned with whether the questioner is
capable of grasping it or not, we should answer only with the genuine
teachings.

When a person within \[the Dharma\] sees \[the genuine teachings\], he
can attain this \[teaching\] with genuine virtue. \[Those outside the
Dharma\] can attain it \[only\] with superficial virtue. We should not
assess \[things\] based on external superficial
characteristics.^[56](#calibre_link-79){#calibre_link-550 .calibre13}^

In ancient times, a person visited Confucius to become his student.
Confucius asked him, "Why do you want to be my disciple?" This worldly
person replied, "Virtuous Worthy One, when I saw you going to court, you
looked very dignified and powerful. Therefore, I want to become your
student." Confucius then asked \[another\] disciple to bring his cart,
garment, gold, silver, and other treasures and gave them to the
\[worldly\] person. \[Confucius\] said, "It is not me that you respect."

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

The emperor's chief advisor of
Uji^[57](#calibre_link-80){#calibre_link-551 .calibre13}^ once came to
the bathhouse \[in the imperial court\] and watched the person who was
in charge of stoking the fire. The bathhouse worker saw him and said,
"Who are you? Why have you come into the court bathhouse without
permission?" \[The chief advisor\] was forced to leave. Then, he took
off the shabby clothes he was wearing and changed into magnificent
attire. When he appeared \[again\] dressed up, the worker in charge of
the fire saw him from a distance, became frightened, and ran away. Then,
the chief advisor put his court dress on the top of a bamboo pole and
paid homage to it. Someone asked what he was doing. He replied, "I am
respected by others not because of my virtue but because of my
clothing." Foolish people respect others in this way. The words and
phrases in the teachings of the Buddhist scriptures are venerated in the
same way.

An ancient said, "The words \[of a statesman\] spread all over the land,
but there is not a fault on his tongue. The actions \[of a statesman\]
govern the whole country, but there is no one who bears a grudge against
him."^[58](#calibre_link-81){#calibre_link-552 .calibre13}^ This is
because \[the statesman\] said what should be said and carried out what
should be carried out. These are the "words and actions of ultimate
virtue and the essence of the
Way."^[59](#calibre_link-82){#calibre_link-553 .calibre13}^ In the
mundane world, most people think and make judgments based on their
self-centered evaluations. I am afraid there might be nothing but
mistakes \[in them\]. The \[proper\] speech and deeds of patch-robed
monks have been established by our predecessors. We should never hold on
to our self-centered views. This is the Way the buddhas and ancestors
have practiced.

Students of the Way, each one of us should reflect on our own self. To
reflect on our self means to examine how we behave with our own body and
mind. Patch-robed monks are already the children of Shakyamuni. We must
follow the lifestyle of the Tathāgata. There are codes of dignified
conduct regarding the manner of body, speech, and
thought^[60](#calibre_link-83){#calibre_link-554 .calibre13}^ that have
been carried out by a thousand buddhas. All of us should follow them.
Even in the lay world, it is said, "Our clothes should be in accordance
with the law; our speech should correspond with the
Way."^[61](#calibre_link-84){#calibre_link-555 .calibre13}^ We \[monks\]
must never follow our own \[ego-centered\] self.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Nowadays, when those who study the Way listen to the Dharma, more than
anything, they want to \[give others\] the impression that they
understand it correctly, and thus they think about how they can reply
with marvelous words. This is why what they hear goes in one ear and out
the other. After all, this happens because they do not have the mind of
awakening and their \[ego-centered\] self remains. We should simply
forget our self and listen carefully to what the speaker says, then
ponder it quietly later. After that, if we find faults or anything
questionable, we may make a criticism on another occasion. And if we
agree with \[the teaching\], we should return to the teacher and offer
our understanding. When we try to present our understanding immediately,
we are not carefully listening to the Dharma.

During the reign of Taizong of the Tang dynasty, a horse that could
travel thousands of miles was presented from a foreign
country.^[62](#calibre_link-85){#calibre_link-556 .calibre13}^ The
emperor was not delighted by this gift. He thought to himself, "Even if
I can travel thousands of miles on this excellent horse, it is useless
if no retainers follow me." Then he summoned Wei Zheng and asked his
opinion about this.^[63](#calibre_link-86){#calibre_link-557
.calibre13}^ Wei Zheng replied, "I agree with you." Because of this,
\[the emperor\] returned the horse with a load of gold and silk on its
back.

Now I say, even the emperor did not keep what was not useful to him and
returned it. Furthermore, for us patch-robed monks, besides robes and a
bowl, there is absolutely nothing that is useful. Why is it that we
store up useless things? Even in the mundane world, those who completely
devote themselves to a certain path do not think it necessary to possess
property such as rice fields or manors. \[Such people\] consider
everyone in the whole country to be their own people or family.

what should be asked, or without saying what should be said, it will be
our own loss. Teachers give responses to their disciples only when they
are asked questions. We should ask again and again to make sure that we
have a definitive understanding even about the things we have already
understood. Teachers also should ask their disciples whether they have
completely understood or not and give them thorough instructions.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

On some important points, the mental attitude of a person of the Way is
different from that of common people. Once while the late superintendent
of monks^[65](#calibre_link-88){#calibre_link-559 .calibre13}^ of
Kennin-ji was still alive, the temple ran out of food. At the time, a
patron^[66](#calibre_link-89){#calibre_link-560 .calibre13}^ invited the
superintendent of monks \[to his home\] and offered him a bolt of silk.
The superintendent of monks rejoiced, tucked it under his kimono, and
carried it back to the temple by himself, without having his attendant
take it for him. He gave the silk to the temple officer in charge and
told him to use it to pay for the next morning's gruel, and so forth.

However, a certain layman made a request saying, "An unfortunate thing
has happened, and I need two or three bolts of silk. If you have even a
small amount, could you kindly let me have it?" The superintendent of
monks immediately took back the silk \[from the temple officer\] and
gave it \[to the layman\]. At the time, the officer and other monks in
his assembly were puzzled by this unexpected action. Later the
superintendent of monks himself said, "You may think what I did was
unreasonable. However, I think that all you monks have gathered together
here because of your aspiration for the Buddha Way. None of us would
mind even if we run out of food or even starve to death. It is more
beneficial to help people living in the lay world who are suffering
right now from a lack of something they need. Even for ourselves, it is
better to give up one day's food and help others' suffering." Thus is
the deep consideration of a person of the Way.

All the buddhas and ancestors were originally ordinary people. While
they were ordinary people they certainly did bad things and had evil
thoughts. Some of them might have been dull-witted or even fools.
However, since they followed their teachers, relied on \[the Buddha's\]
teaching and practice, and transformed themselves, they all became
buddhas and ancestors. Today's people should also do the same. We should
not disparage ourselves, thinking we are foolish or dull-witted. If we
do not arouse the mind \[of awakening\] in this present lifetime, when
can we expect to? If we are fond of \[the Way\], we will surely attain
it.

## [1-14]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-27 .head2}

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

In the lay world, there is a proverb about the way of the emperor:
"Unless one's mind is empty, it is impossible to accept loyal advice."
This saying means that without holding personal views, \[the emperor\]
should follow the opinions of loyal ministers and carry out the way of
the sovereign according to how things ought to be.

The attitude of patch-robed monks practicing the Way should be the same.
If we hold on to our personal views, the words of our teacher will not
enter our ears. If we do not listen to our teacher's words, we cannot
attain our teacher's Dharma.

We should forget not only different views on the Dharma gates but
worldly affairs, hunger, and cold as well. When we listen completely
purified in body and mind, we can hear intimately. When we listen in
this way, we will be able to clarify the truth and resolve our
questions. True attainment of the Way is casting aside body and mind and
following our teacher straightforwardly. If we maintain this attitude,
we will be true people of the Way. This is the primary truth.

[One day]{.italice} \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

In the [Continued Biographies of Eminent
Monks]{.italice},^[67](#calibre_link-91){#calibre_link-561 .calibre13}^
there is a story about a monk in the assembly of a certain Zen master.
\[This monk\] worshiped a golden image of the Buddha as well as the
relics^[68](#calibre_link-92){#calibre_link-562 .calibre13}^ of the
Buddha. Even in the study hall, he always burned incense and prostrated
himself in front of them, honoring them and making
offerings.^[69](#calibre_link-93){#calibre_link-563 .calibre13}^

One time, the Zen master said, "The image and relics of the Buddha that
you worship eventually will be harmful to you." The monk was not
convinced. The master continued, "They are haunted by the heavenly demon
Pāpīyas.^[70](#calibre_link-94){#calibre_link-564 .calibre13}^ You
should throw them away at once." As the monk was leaving in anger, the
master shouted after him, "Open the box and look inside!" Although
angry, the monk opened up the box; just as the master had said, a
poisonous snake was lying coiled up inside.

As I think of this story, images and relics of the Buddha should
\[still\] be venerated because they are the bones left by the
Tathāgata.^[71](#calibre_link-95){#calibre_link-565 .calibre13}^
Nevertheless, it is a mistaken view to think that we can attain
realization just by worshiping them. Such a view will cause us to become
possessed by demons and poisonous snakes. In the Buddhist teachings, it
is said that \[veneration of relics\] has merit, and therefore it surely
brings happiness^[72](#calibre_link-96){#calibre_link-566 .calibre13}^
in the human and heavenly realms, just like \[venerating\] the living
body of the Buddha. In general, it is true that if we venerate and make
offerings to the realm of the Three Treasures, our faults will disappear
and we will gain merit, the karma that leads us to the evil realms will
be removed, and we will be born in the realms of human and heavenly
beings. However, it is a mistaken view to cling to such activities and
say that we have attained the Buddha's realization through these \[acts
alone\].

The Buddha's children should follow the Buddha's teachings. To reach
Buddhahood we should make an effort to practice the Way
wholeheartedly.^[73](#calibre_link-97){#calibre_link-567 .calibre13}^
The genuine practice of being in accordance with the \[Buddha's\]
teaching is nothing other than just
sitting,^[74](#calibre_link-98){#calibre_link-568 .calibre13}^ the
essence of our practice in this monastery. We must keep this in mind.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

Even though we should protect and maintain our practice based on the
precepts and the regulations for eating, it is also wrong to take them
as paramount, focusing on them as our only task, and think that we will
attain the Way \[merely\] by living in such a
manner.^[75](#calibre_link-99){#calibre_link-569 .calibre13}^ We follow
these regulations simply because that is how patch-robed monks behave;
this is the family style^[76](#calibre_link-100){#calibre_link-570
.calibre13}^ of the Buddha's children. Although \[keeping the precepts\]
is a good thing, it is wrong to grasp them alone as the essential
practice. However, I am not saying that we should break the precepts and
become self-indulgent. Clinging to such an attitude is a mistaken view,
and \[if we do so\] we will be outside the Buddha Way. We follow \[the
precepts\] only because that is the standard of the Buddha's family and
the family style of Zen monasteries. While I was staying at the
monasteries in the country of Song \[China\], I did not see the monks
make them their primary practice.

For true attainment of the Way, the devotion of all effort to zazen
alone \[is what\] has been transmitted from the buddhas and
ancestors.^[77](#calibre_link-101){#calibre_link-571 .calibre13}^ For
this reason, I taught a fellow student of mine,
Gokonbō,^[78](#calibre_link-102){#calibre_link-572 .calibre13}^ a
disciple of the late Superintendent of Monks
Yōjō,^[79](#calibre_link-103){#calibre_link-573 .calibre13}^ to abandon
his strong adherence to the eating regulations and recitation of the
[Precepts]{.italice}
[Sutra]{.italice}^[80](#calibre_link-104){#calibre_link-574 .calibre13}^

Ejō asked, "Regarding the standards of studying the Way in a monastery,
should we maintain Baizhang's [Pure
Standards]{.italice}?^[81](#calibre_link-105){#calibre_link-575
.calibre13}^ If so, at their outset we find, 'receiving the precepts and
maintaining the precepts are prerequisites.' Also, it seems that the
fundamental precepts^[82](#calibre_link-106){#calibre_link-576
.calibre13}^ have been handed down in the tradition that you are
transmitting. In the oral as well as the face-to-face transmission of
this lineage, the precepts transmitted from the West \[India\] have also
been bestowed. These are the bodhisattva precepts we \[are discussing\]
now. In the [Precepts Sutra]{.italice} \[we are studying\] now, it is
said that we should recite it day and
night.^[83](#calibre_link-107){#calibre_link-577 .calibre13}^ Why would
you have us stop reciting it?"

[The master]{.italice} \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

\[What you say\] is correct. Students, first of all, should maintain the
regulations laid down by Baizhang. However, regarding those standards,
the precepts are maintained \[by doing\] zazen, and so forth. "Reciting
the [Precepts]{.italice} [Sutra]{.italice} day and night and keeping the
precepts single-mindedly" means nothing other than practicing just
sitting, in the manner of the ancients. When we do zazen, which precept
is not observed? Which virtue is not actualized? All of the activities
practiced by the ancients have deep meaning. Without clinging to our
personal preferences, we should go along with the assembly and practice,
entrusting ourselves to the way the ancients
practiced.^[84](#calibre_link-108){#calibre_link-578 .calibre13}^

## [2-2]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-31 .head2}

[One day]{.italice} \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

If we are born into a certain family and \[therefore\] enter a certain
field, we must first of all receive training in that family business and
understand it. It is improper to learn and be acquainted with other
things that have nothing to do with our own path or specialty.

[]{#calibre_link-1007 .calibre2}

Now, we are home-leavers, have entered the Buddha's family, and have
begun to walk the path of monks. We must study the works of \[Buddhist
monks\]. To maintain the way \[of Buddhist monks\] is to give up
self-attachment and follow the guidance of our teachers. The essential
point here is to be free from greed. If we wish to put an end to greed,
we must first depart from our ego-centered self. To depart from the
ego-centered self, seeing impermanence is the primary
concern.^[85](#calibre_link-109){#calibre_link-579 .calibre13}^

Most people in the world want to have a good reputation and to be
appreciated, not only by themselves but also by others. Because of that
\[defiled motivation\], we cannot become better. Just give up
self-attachment gradually, keep following the sayings of a master, and
you will progress.

If we cling to a certain thing and prefer to pursue it, saying, "\[The
teacher\] speaks as if he understands the truth, and he might be right,
but I am not able to give up this thing," we will sink deeper.

For a Zen monk to make progress, the most important thing to keep in
mind is that we must just sit \[[shikantaza]{.italice}\]. Whether we are
sharp or dull-witted, wise or foolish, if we practice zazen, we will
naturally improve.

## [2-3]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-34 .head2}

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

It is not possible to study extensively and obtain wide knowledge. We
must have the solid determination to stop doing \[such things\]. Simply
focusing on one thing, we must study \[proper\] mental attitudes and the
ancient practices, and investigate how our predecessors practiced. We
should concentrate our efforts solely on one practice, and we should not
pretend to be teachers or leaders of others.

'Nanquan knows only the cutting \[of the cat\] into two pieces with one
stroke; he does not know the cutting of it into one piece with one
stroke.'"

Ejō said, "What is cutting it into one piece with one stroke?"

The master said, "When the assembly could not speak, and no one answered
for a while, Nanquan should have said, 'The assembly has spoken,' and
released the cat. An ancient said, 'When the great function manifests
itself, there are no fixed
rules.'"^[90](#calibre_link-114){#calibre_link-584 .calibre13}^

\[Dōgen\] also said, "This 'cutting a cat' is nothing other than the
great function of the Buddhadharma, or \[nothing other than\] 'pivotal
words.'^[91](#calibre_link-115){#calibre_link-585 .calibre13}^ If it is
not \[intended as\] a pivotal word, we must not say that 'the mountains,
rivers, and the great earth are the wondrous, pure, and bright
mind.'^[92](#calibre_link-116){#calibre_link-586 .calibre13}^ Nor should
we say that 'the mind is itself
Buddha.'^[93](#calibre_link-117){#calibre_link-587 .calibre13}^

Upon hearing these pivotal words, we immediately see that the cat's body
is nothing other than the Buddha's body; also upon hearing these words,
students can suddenly enter realization."

\[Dōgen\] also said, "This cutting of the cat is the action of a
Buddha."

\[Ejō asked,\] "What shall we call this?"

'offenses,' or 'offensive actions'; they are not called 'violations of
the precepts.'"

\[Dōgen\] replied, "Receiving the precepts and reciting the precepts are
two different things. Reciting the [Precepts Sutra]{.italice} for the
sake of repentance is nothing other than the reading of sutras.
Therefore, \[even\] those who have not yet received the precepts recite
the [Precepts Sutra]{.italice}. It cannot be wrong to explain the
[Precepts Sutra]{.italice} to them. What the later section of the
[Sutra]{.italice} says is that we should not preach the precepts to
people who have not received them for the purpose of gaining profit. We
should certainly teach the precepts \[to those who wish to repent\]."

\[Ejō\] asked, "\[In the [Precepts Sutra]{.italice}\] it is said that
when we receive the precepts, we should repent of the seven grave
crimes. What do you make of
this?"^[100](#calibre_link-124){#calibre_link-594 .calibre13}^

\[Dōgen\] replied, "We should certainly repent of them. The meaning of
the passage 'they are not permitted to receive the precepts' is for the
purpose of preventing \[people from committing the seven grave
crimes\].^[101](#calibre_link-125){#calibre_link-595 .calibre13}^ The
previous passage means that even if someone violates the precepts, they
will be pure when they receive the precepts again. When they repent,
they are purified. \[Those who have received the precepts but then
committed offenses\] are different from people who have not yet received
the precepts."

\[Ejō\] asked, "If those who have committed any of the seven grave
crimes are permitted to repent, can they receive the precepts again?"

\[Dōgen\] replied, "Yes. The late superintendent of monks \[Eisai\]
himself insisted on this point. Once \[people who have committed one of
the seven grave crimes\] are allowed to repent, they are also permitted
to receive the precepts. The master should allow those who have
committed even the seven grave crimes to receive the precepts if they
have repented. Even if the master himself violates the precepts by doing
so, as a bodhisattva, for the sake of saving them, the master must allow
them to receive the precepts."

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

Do not use abusive language to scold or blame
monks.^[103](#calibre_link-127){#calibre_link-597 .calibre13}^ Even if
they are bad or incapable, do not harbor hatred against them or abuse
them thoughtlessly. First of all, no matter how bad they might be, when
more than four monks gather together and practice, they form a sangha,
which is a priceless national
treasure.^[104](#calibre_link-128){#calibre_link-598 .calibre13}^ We
should take refuge in \[the sangha\] and respect it most highly. Even if
we are the abbot or an elder, or the master or a teacher, \[if monks of
the assembly\] are bad, we have to instruct and guide them with a
compassionate mind and a parental
heart.^[105](#calibre_link-129){#calibre_link-599 .calibre13}^ In doing
so, even when we have to slap those who should be slapped or scold those
who should be scolded, we should not allow ourselves to vilify them or
arouse feelings of hatred.

When my late teacher Rujing^[106](#calibre_link-130){#calibre_link-600

of the assembly with his slipper or scold them with harsh words in order
to keep them awake while they were sitting zazen in the monks' hall. Yet
all of us were thankful to be hit, and we praised him.[　]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}

Once in a formal Dharma discourse he said, "I have grown old now. I
should have retired from the monastery by now and moved into a hermitage
to care for myself in my old age. However, I am your teacher, and it is
my duty to break the delusions of each of you. As the abbot I must help
you attain the Way. To do so, I sometimes have to use harsh language to
scold you, or hit you with a bamboo stick, and so forth. I regret having
to do this. However, this is the way to enable the Dharma to flourish on
behalf of the Buddha. Brothers, please have compassion for me, and
forgive me for these deeds." Upon hearing these words all of us shed
tears.

Only with such a spirit can we lead an assembly and spread the
\[Dharma\] teachings. Even if you are an abbot or a senior monk, it is
wrong to govern the community and abuse the monks as if they were your
personal belongings. Furthermore, if you are not in such a position, you
should not discuss others' faults or speak ill of them. We must be very,
very careful. When we see someone's faults, think they are wrong, and
wish to instruct them with compassion, we must confront them with
skillful means to avoid arousing their anger, and do so as if we were
talking about something else.

beginning his time as the assistant secretary of the headquarters of the

minister of the interior.^[109](#calibre_link-133){#calibre_link-603
.calibre13}^ There was a man who was making a disturbance.

Then, the major councilor^[110](#calibre_link-134){#calibre_link-604
.calibre13}^ asked \[Yoritomo\] to restrain the person.

The general \[Yoritomo\] replied, "Give your order to Rokuhara. He is
the general of the Taira
clan."^[111](#calibre_link-135){#calibre_link-605

The major councilor said, "But you are right here."

The general said, "I am not the person \[in charge of

such an attitude. Today's students of the Way should have the same

Lord Pingyuan praised him and rewarded him with large amounts of gold,
silver, and other things, but Lu Zhonglian refused, saying, "I subdued
the enemies only because that is the way of a general. I had no
intention of receiving a reward." So saying, he did not accept the
reward. Because of this incident, Lu Zhonglian is famous for his
righteousness and integrity.

Even in the lay world, those who are wise use their abilities and
accomplish things solely for the sake of fulfilling their paths. They do
not think of receiving rewards. A student \[of the Way\] should also
maintain such a mental attitude. Once we have entered the Buddha Way,
whatever practice we do should be for the sake of the Buddha Way. We
should not think of gaining something in return. All the various
teachings, whether Buddhist or non-Buddhist, encourage us to be without
gaining-mind.

(I took down only the essence \[of what Dōgen said\].)

[On the occasion of a Dharma talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\]
[instructed]{.italice}:

Even when we speak rationally while another person says unreasonable
things, it is wrong to defeat the person by arguing logically. On the
other hand, it is not good to give up hastily, saying that we are wrong
even if we think that we are actually correct. Neither defeat the person
nor withdraw by saying we were wrong.

It is best to just leave the matter alone and stop arguing. When we act
as if we have not heard and forget about the matter, the person will
forget, too, and will not get angry. This is the most important point to
keep in mind.

Impermanence is swift. Life-and-death is the great
matter.^[113](#calibre_link-137){#calibre_link-607 .calibre13}^
\[Because\] the duration of our lives is short, if you wish to learn
something and you would like to study something, just practice the
Buddha Way and study the Buddhadharma. Literature, poetry, and the like
are useless. It is unnecessary to \[even\] say why we should give them
up. Even when you study the Buddhadharma and practice the Buddha Way, do
not engage in a variety of extensive studies at the same time. Moreover,
we should refrain from studying the exoteric and esoteric scriptures of
the teaching schools.^[114](#calibre_link-138){#calibre_link-608
.calibre13}^ We should not be fond of widely studying even the sayings
of the buddhas and ancestors. For those of us who are dull-witted and of
inferior capacity, it is not even possible to concentrate on a single
thing and master it completely. Furthermore, it is not good to do many
things at the same time and lose harmony of mind and

In ancient times, a person called Zen Master
Zhijue^[116](#calibre_link-140){#calibre_link-610 .calibre13}^ aroused
the mind of awakening and left home. This master was originally a
government official. He was a wealthy, straightforward, and wise man.
While he was a provincial governor, he unlawfully appropriated official
money and gave it to the people. One of the officials working with him
reported this to the government. Upon hearing it, the emperor was
astonished and puzzled. All of the ministers also thought it strange.
Because the crime was not a minor one, it was decided that he would be
put to death.

At that time, the emperor talked the matter over and said, "This officer
is a man of talent and wisdom. Now, he intentionally committed this
crime, but he might have deeply considered \[his actions\]. When he is
about to be beheaded, if he looks sorrowful and regretful, cut off his
head immediately. If he does not show such an expression, he certainly
had some profound motivation; do not execute him."

When the imperial messenger brought him out for his beheading, he showed
neither regret nor grief. Instead, he looked joyful. He said to himself,
"I offer my life in this lifetime to all living beings." The messenger,
astonished and beguiled, reported this to the emperor.

The emperor said, "I thought so! He must have had some deeper
motivation. I knew beforehand that he had some justification." Then he
asked him what the reason was.

The master said, "I wanted to leave the bureaucracy, offer up my life,
and practice in order to form a connection with living beings. I wish to
be born in the Buddha's family and wholeheartedly practice the Buddha
Way."

The emperor was moved by his aspiration and gave him permission to
become a monk. Then the emperor gave him the Dharma name Yanshou,
meaning "prolonged life." This was because he had been saved from
capital punishment.

Today's patch-robed monks must also arouse aspiration like this at least
once. We should arouse the mind that thinks little of our own life, has
deep compassion for all living beings, and entrusts our bodily life to
the Buddha's teachings. If we have already aroused such an aspiration
even once, we should protect it and not lose it. It is not possible to
actualize the Buddhadharma without having once aroused such an
aspiration.

## [2-10]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-47 .head2}

[In an evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

In the tradition of the ancestors, the true way of understanding a Zen
sermon is to follow the teacher's words and to gradually reform the mind
that has known and thought \[various fixed concepts\] since time
immemorial. Even if we have previously thought that a buddha has
excellent characteristics, is fully equipped with radiant light, and has
the virtue of preaching the Dharma and benefiting living beings, like
Shakyamuni or Amitābha, we should \[nonetheless\] believe our teacher if
he tells us that a buddha is nothing but a toad or an earthworm. We
should give up our former knowledge. If we look for certain excellent
characteristics in a toad or an earthworm, \[such as\] radiant light or
other buddha virtues, \[then\] we still have not reformed our
discriminating minds. Just know that what we see right now is buddha.
If, in this way, we continually reform our discriminating minds and
fundamental attachments according to our teacher's instructions, we will
naturally become one with the Way. Students of the present day, however,
cling to their discriminating minds. Their thinking is based on their
personal views that a buddha must be such and such; if what they hear
conflicts with their ideas, they say that a buddha cannot be so. Having
such an attitude and wandering here and there in delusion, searching for
what reinforces their preconceptions, most of them never make any
progress in the Buddha Way.

[In an evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

Even worldly people should focus on one thing and master it thoroughly
enough to be able to perform it in front of others, instead of learning
many things at the same time without truly mastering any of them. What's
more, from the beginningless beginning, we have never learned and
practiced the Buddhadharma that transcends the mundane world. Therefore,
until now we have been unacquainted with it. Our natures are also
inferior. If we try to learn extensively about the many lofty and
boundless matters of the Buddhadharma, we will not master even a single
thing. Because by nature our capacities are dull and poor, even if we
try to concentrate on one thing, it is not possible to thoroughly master
that one thing in this lifetime. Students, we should definitely
concentrate on one single thing.

Ejō asked, "If that is the case, to which thing or practice of the
Buddhadharma should we choose to devote ourselves?"

[The master said]{.italice}:

Although it depends upon one's character and capabilities, down to the
present day it is zazen that has been handed down and concentrated on in
the communities of the ancestors. This practice is suitable for people
of all capacities. This Dharma can be practiced equally by those of
superior, mediocre, or inferior capabilities. After I heard this truth
while I was in the assembly of my late teacher
Tiantong^[118](#calibre_link-142){#calibre_link-612 .calibre13}^ in
great Song China, I sat zazen constantly day and night. When it was
extremely hot or cold, many monks gave up sitting for a while because
they were afraid of getting sick. At that time, I thought to myself,
"Even though I might become sick and die, I should practice this
regardless. If I do not practice when I am not sick, then what is the
use of taking care of this body? Even if I get sick and die, it will be
in accord with my original intention. If I practice and die in the
assembly of an eminent teacher in great Song China and am buried by such
wonderful monks, for one thing it will establish good affinity \[with
the Buddhadharma\]. If I die in Japan, it will be impossible to have my
funeral service performed by such people or according to
authentic^[119](#calibre_link-143){#calibre_link-613 .calibre13}^
Buddhist ceremonies. If I die while practicing, before I can accord with
the Way, because of this good affinity I will once again be born into
the Buddha's family. Without practice it is meaningless to live long.
What would be the use of \[such a life\]? Furthermore, even if I think I
can keep my body healthy and free of illness, I might drown in the ocean
or meet some accidental death. How regrettable this would be!" I
continued to think in this way and practiced upright, sitting day and
night with this determination. In the end, I never got sick at all.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Students of the Way! Do not be troubled when it comes to food and
clothing. Just maintain the Buddha's precepts, and do not concern
yourself with worldly affairs.

The Buddha said, "For clothing, there are robes made of abandoned
rags;^[121](#calibre_link-145){#calibre_link-615 .calibre13}^ for food,
there is always begging." In what age will these two things ever be
exhausted? Do not forget the swiftness of impermanence or be vainly
disturbed by worldly affairs. While we temporarily have our dew-like
human lives, think exclusively of the Buddha Way, and do not be
concerned with other things.[　]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}

Someone remarked, "Although fame and profit are difficult to give up,
because their pursuit is a great obstruction to the practice of the Way,
they should be abandoned. Therefore, I will give them up. Although
clothing and food are minor things, they are important for
practitioners. Wearing clothes made of abandoned rags and only begging
for food were practices of superior people. Moreover, that was the
custom in India. The monasteries in China have \[communal\] permanent
property.^[122](#calibre_link-146){#calibre_link-616 .calibre13}^
Therefore, they do not need to worry about such things. In the temples
in our country, there is no such property. The practice of begging has
ceased and has not been transmitted at all. What should inferior people
like me who cannot endure \[such practices\] do? If someone like me
tries to gather alms from faithful lay supporters, I will violate the
precept that prohibits deceitfully receiving donations \[while in fact
lacking virtue\]. Earning a living as a farmer, merchant, warrior, or
craftsman is wrong livelihood^[123](#calibre_link-147){#calibre_link-617
.calibre13}^ \[for a monk\]. If I trust the workings of the heavens, I
will remain an inferior monk as a result of \[my\] inferior karma. When
hunger and cold come, I will be in distress and my practice will be
hindered. Someone admonished me, saying, 'Your way of practice is too
extreme. It seems you do not reflect on this age and your capacity. Our
faculties are inferior, and this is the \[degenerate\] age of the last
Dharma.^[124](#calibre_link-148){#calibre_link-618 .calibre13}^ Such a
manner of practice will become causes and conditions for regression
\[from the Way\]. Arrange for support from a donor or get protection
from a patron, take care of your body by living in a quiet place without
worrying about food or clothing, and practice the Buddha Way peacefully.
This is \[what it means\] not to covet property or belongings. You
should practice after having provided for your temporal livelihood.'
Although I listened to his admonishment, I still do not believe it. What
do you think about such a frame of mind?"

style of the buddhas and ancestors. Although \[the customs of\] the

are different, those who truly study the Way never practice in such a
manner \[as described by this person\]. Simply disregard worldly
affairs. We should single-mindedly study the Way.

The Buddha said, "Do not store up anything except robes and a bowl. Any
extra food you have received through begging should be given away to
hungry living beings." Even when you receive \[more than enough\], do
not store it up. Moreover, we should not run after things.

In a non-Buddhist text it is said, "If we hear the Way in the morning,
it is fine to die that

eons and thousands of lifetimes, how many times are we born, and how

[]{#calibre_link-1087 .calibre2}

However, in the collections of all the Buddhist sutras, I have never
read of a single buddha or ancestor who transmitted the Dharma in the
three countries who died of starvation or from the cold. As a gift, each
person in this world receives, along with an allotted life span, a
certain amount of food and clothing. They do not come as a result of
being sought after, nor do they stop coming when they are not sought
after. Just leave them to fate, and do not trouble your mind about them.
If we refrain from arousing the mind of awakening in this lifetime,
excusing ourselves on the grounds that this is the degenerate age of the
last Dharma, then in which lifetime will it be possible to attain the
Way? Even if we are not the equals of
Subhūti^[127](#calibre_link-151){#calibre_link-621 .calibre13}^ or
Mahākāśyapa,^[128](#calibre_link-152){#calibre_link-622 .calibre13}^ we
should practice to our fullest capability.

In a non-Buddhist text it is said, "Even if she is not as beautiful as
Xishi or Maoqiang, those who love women will love
women.^[129](#calibre_link-153){#calibre_link-623 .calibre13}^ Even if
it is not as great as Feitu or Lu'er, those who love horses will love
horses.^[130](#calibre_link-154){#calibre_link-624 .calibre13}^ Even if
it is not as delicious as dragon's liver or leopard's embryo, those who
love flavor will love
flavor."^[131](#calibre_link-155){#calibre_link-625 .calibre13}^ We just
have to use whatever wisdom we have. Even laypeople have this attitude.
Monks must also be like this.

Moreover, the Buddha offered twenty years of his longevity to us living
in this degenerate age of the last Dharma. As a result, the offerings
and support to the monasteries in this world given by human and heavenly
beings have not ceased. Though the Tathāgata had divine powers and
virtues and was able to use them at will, he spent a summer practice
period eating grain meant for
horses.^[132](#calibre_link-156){#calibre_link-626 .calibre13}^ What can
his disciples in the age of the last Dharma do but yearn to follow his
example.

It was asked, "Rather than vainly receiving offerings from human or
heavenly beings while breaking the precepts, or wastefully exhausting
the endowment of the Tathāgata without the mind of awakening, would it
not be better to live as a layperson, engaging in ordinary family work,
keeping ourselves alive, and continuing the practice of the Way?"

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [answered]{.italice}:

Who said anything about breaking the precepts or being without the mind
of awakening? We should simply arouse the mind of awakening forcibly and
practice the Buddhadharma.

Moreover, it is said that the legacy of the Tathāgata's blessing is
bestowed equally, without regard to whether we maintain the precepts or
break them, or whether we are beginners or advanced practitioners. It is
not written anywhere that we must return to the mundane world if we have
violated the precepts or we must stop practicing if we lack the mind of
awakening. Who has the mind of awakening from the outset? If we just
arouse what is difficult to arouse and practice what is difficult to
practice, in this way we will naturally progress. Each one of us has
Buddha-nature. Do not meaninglessly deprecate yourselves.

Also, in the [Selections of Refined Literature]{.italice}, it is
written, "The prosperity of the country is brought about by a single
wise person. The Way of the ancients later dies out because of a
fool."^[133](#calibre_link-157){#calibre_link-627 .calibre13}^ This
means that if a single person of wisdom appears, the country will
flourish, and if a single fool appears, the way of the ancients will
disappear. Consider this well.

[In a miscellaneous talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\]
[said]{.italice}:

When engaged in idle talk, men and women in society, both the young and
old, often chat about lewd things. In doing so, they amuse their minds
and beguile themselves. Although such idle chatter seems to entertain
their minds and divert them from boredom momentarily, monks should
completely refrain from such talk. Even in lay society, when
well-educated and sincere people discuss some serious subject with due
courtesy, they do not engage in such talk. They do so only when they are
drunk or otherwise unrestrained. Needless to say, monks must concern
themselves only with the Buddha Way. Only a few eccentric and immoral
monks engage in such indecent talk.

In the monasteries in Song China, because monks do not engage in idle
talk, they never speak of such \[lewd\] matters. Even in our country,
while the superintendent of monks and abbot of Kennin-ji \[Eisai\] was
alive, such talk did not occur at all. Even after his death, while a few
of his disciples were still at the monastery, people did not speak of
such things. Lately, over the last seven or eight years, the young monks
have sometimes indulged in idle
talk.^[134](#calibre_link-158){#calibre_link-628 .calibre13}^ This is an
unexpected turn of events.

In the sacred teachings it is said, "Though coarse and violent actions
may sometimes cause people to wake up, worthless speech obstructs the
true Way."^[135](#calibre_link-159){#calibre_link-629 .calibre13}^ Even
if it is a word that comes to the lips unintentionally, unbeneficial
talk can be a cause and a condition for the obstruction of the Way.
Moreover, such lewd talk might cause an \[indecent\] mind to arise. We
must be most careful. Without intentionally forcing yourself not to use
such language, realize it is an unwholesome thing and you will be able
to reform gradually.

[In an evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

Most people in the world want their good deeds to be known by others
when they do good things. When they do wicked things, they want their
misdeeds to be hidden from other people. Because this mindset is not in
accord with the unseen deities, good things done by \[such people\] go
unrewarded, and their wicked deeds done in secret bring about
punishment.^[136](#calibre_link-160){#calibre_link-630 .calibre13}^
Therefore, they privately lament that there are no rewards for good
deeds and \[there is\] no merit in the Buddhadharma. This is a perverted
view. We must certainly reform it. While no one is watching, we should
do good things in secret. After we have done something unwholesome, we
should expose our misdeeds and repent. When you act in this manner, good
deeds done in secret will have rewards, and exposed wrong deeds will be
repented so that punishment can be dispelled. Therefore, there will
naturally be benefit in this present lifetime, and you will \[also\] be
sure of the results in future lifetimes.

Once a certain layperson came and asked, "These days, although laypeople
make offerings to monks, and take refuge in and venerate the
Buddhadharma, much misfortune occurs. For this reason, evil thoughts
have arisen, and people believe they should no longer take refuge in the
Three Treasures. What do you think of this?"

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [replied]{.italice}:

This is not the fault of monks or the Buddhadharma but a mistake on
behalf of the laypeople themselves. As for the reason for this, for
example, they revere and make offerings only to monks who publicly
observe the precepts and the eating regulations, but they do not make
offerings to shameless monks who break the precepts, drink alcohol, and
eat meat, judging them to be worthless. This biased and discriminating
mind truly goes against the intention of the Buddha. Because of this,
their taking of refuge and reverence is in vain, and there are no
positive consequences. Here and there within the precepts, there are
admonitions against this frame of
mind.^[137](#calibre_link-161){#calibre_link-631 .calibre13}^ You should
make offerings to all monks, regardless of whether they have any virtue
or not. Most importantly, never judge whether or not they have inner
virtue based on their outward appearances. Although monks in this
degenerate age look somewhat normal in their outward appearances, they
may have much more corrupt minds and do wicked deeds. Therefore, without
discriminating between good and bad monks, respect them all simply
because they are the Buddha's disciples; make offerings and take refuge
with a mind of equality. Then you will surely be in accordance with the
Buddha's intention, and you will receive benefits instantaneously.

Also, we should consider the four phrases: "unseen action, unseen
response; seen action, seen response \[unseen action, seen response;
seen action, unseen
response\]."^[138](#calibre_link-162){#calibre_link-632 .calibre13}^
There is also the principle of karma and its effects in the three
periods of time \[we receive the effects of karma in the present
lifetime, in the next lifetime, or in some later lifetime\]. Study these
principles very carefully.^[139](#calibre_link-163){#calibre_link-633

[In an evening]{.italice} [talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\]
[said]{.italice}:

Suppose someone comes to talk about his business and asks us to write a
letter to solicit something from someone, or to help him in a lawsuit or
the like, but we turn down the request, excusing ourselves on the
grounds that we are not people \[of the mundane world\], that we have
withdrawn and have nothing to do with worldly affairs, and that it is
wrong for renunciants like us to speak about unsuitable things with
laypeople. \[However,\] we must consider the specifics of the situation.
Although such an attitude truly seems like the way of a renunciant, it
might not be. When we deeply examine our mind, \[we can see\] that we
dismiss the request because we think we are monks who have left the
mundane world, and people might think badly of us if we say something
improper for a renunciant. This still shows our ego-attachment to fame
and reputation. For the sake of the person in front of us, we should do
anything that may bring even a little benefit \[to them\] without
consideration of whether others might think badly of us. Even if we
become estranged from our friends or quarrel with them because they
think we did something improper, it should not concern us to break off
\[relations\] with such unwise people. Although outwardly it may seem to
others that we are doing something unacceptable, our primary concern
should be to break off the ego-attachment inside of us and throw away
any desire for fame and reputation.

When someone comes to ask them for help, buddhas and bodhisattvas cut
off even their own flesh, hands, or feet. How much more should we be
willing to help a person who asks us to simply write a letter. If we
reject the request, being concerned with \[the effect on\] our personal
reputation from a tiny wrongdoing, we are guilty of ego-attachment.
Although without careful consideration others may regard us as unworthy
renunciants and say inappropriate things, if we throw away our concern
for fame and bring even a little benefit to others, we are surely in
accordance with the true Way. We find many examples of the ancient sages
who appear to have had the same attitude. I also believe in these
examples. It is an easy thing to help a small amount when our supporters
or friends ask us to write something for them, even if it is a bit
unexpected. We need only a sheet of paper.

explain to the person who asks us, and also state in the letter, that we
are writing it because we were asked to do so, and tell \[the
recipient\] that they should decide whether it is right or wrong to deal
with the matter. The person who receives the letter and has to deal with
the problem should decide whether it is right or wrong. It is not our
business. It is also wrong to ask the person \[we write to\] to do
something that bends the rules \[for the person we are writing for\]
regarding such matters. If we ask a friend or a patron to do something
wrong or unacceptable, he might feel compelled to do it because of his
respect for us, even though the request was actually made by the person
for whom we are writing the letter. In this case, we should write in the
letter, "I am writing this letter simply because I have been asked
importunately. Please deal with this matter reasonably." If we treat
each situation in this way, no one will hold a grudge.

We must consider things like this very meticulously in every encounter
with people or situations. The primary concern is to cast aside the
desire for fame and ego-attachment in each situation.

## [2-17]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-61 .head2}

[In an]{.italice} [evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\]
[said]{.italice}:

In the mundane world today and among those of the monastic world, people
want to make sure that their good deeds are known to others, and when
they do a bad thing, they try to prevent others from noticing. Because
of this, a discordance between their internal \[thought\] and external
\[appearances\] occurs. We should carefully aspire to make the inner
self correspond with outside appearances by repenting of faults, hiding
our real virtue, and not being ostentatious; we should offer good things
to others and accept bad things for ourselves.

Someone asked, "Surely, we should maintain the attitude of hiding our
true virtue and not adorning our outside appearances. And yet, the
essence of the great compassion of buddhas and bodhisattvas is to
benefit living beings. If ignorant monks or laypeople see our
unwholesome external appearances and blame us, they will become guilty
of slandering the sangha. Even if they do not understand true inner
virtue, if they see good outside appearances, venerate us, and make
offerings, they will receive merit that brings about happiness. What do
you think of such considerations for others?"

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [replied]{.italice}:

Even if we do not adorn our outward appearances, if we become
self-indulgent, it is against the principle of the Way. If we
\[intentionally\] carry out unwholesome deeds in front of laypeople with
the stated excuse of hiding our true virtue, this is certainly a gross
violation of the precepts. \[However,\] some monks merely wish to gain
fame as rare people with the mind of awakening and want other people not
to know their faults. I caution such shameless people who desire to be
respected by others: the unseen good heavenly beings, the guardian
deities, and the Three Treasures are watching them. We must simply
consider all things carefully such that the Dharma flourishes and living
beings are benefited in every moment and situation. It is said, "Speak
after careful consideration; act after attentive thought; do not act
rashly." Ponder over what is reasonable in each and every situation you
encounter. \[Our life\] changes moment by moment and flows swiftly day
by day. Everything is impermanent and changing rapidly. This is the
reality before our eyes. We do not need to wait for the teaching of
masters or scriptures \[to see this\]. In every moment, do not expect
that tomorrow will come. Think only of this day and this moment. Because
days to come are very much uncertain and we cannot foresee what will
happen, we should resolve to follow the Buddha Way while we are still
alive, if only for today. The followers of the Buddhadharma give up
their bodily lives and act to enable the Dharma to flourish and bring
benefit to living beings.

Someone asked, "According to the Buddha's teachings, should we practice

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [replied]{.italice}:

Yes, we should. However, we have to take into consideration the customs
and conditions of each country. Whatever the situation, we should choose
what is best for the benefit of living beings and for the progress of
our own practice. As for the manners of begging, because roads in this
country are dirty, if we walk around wearing Buddhist robes, they will
become soiled. Also, because people are poor, it may be impossible to
beg without discrimination.^[140](#calibre_link-164){#calibre_link-634
.calibre13}^ \[If we cling to such a traditional form,\] our practice
could regress, and we would be unable to benefit living beings. If we
practice in a humble manner following the customs of the country, people
of all classes will support us by making offerings of their own accord.
Then, practice for ourselves and for the benefit of others will be
fulfilled. In each situation, try to choose what is best for the sake of
the Buddha Way and for the benefit of others. Do not be concerned with
your personal reputation, and forget your own profit.

Even among those who retreat from the world and live secluded in the
mountains or forests, there are some who fear that their families, which
have persisted for many generations, will cease to exist, and so they
become anxious about their family members and relatives.

Although some people depart from their homes and give up family or
property, there are those who have not yet given up their bodies. They
think that they should not do anything physically painful and should
avoid practicing anything that may cause sickness, even though they know
it to be the Buddha Way.

Furthermore, even if they may carry out hard and painful practices
without clinging to their bodily lives, their minds have not yet entered
the Buddha Way. If they resolve not to act against their own minds even
if these actions are the Buddha Way, then they have not yet given up
their minds.

Practitioners! If we first
regulate^[142](#calibre_link-167){#calibre_link-636 .calibre13}^ the
mind, it is easy to renounce the body as well as the world. As for our
speech and behavior, we only think of how other people view us. We
refrain from doing wicked things \[only\] because these are not good and
other people will think ill of us; we do good things at every occasion
\[only\] because others will consider us to be people of the
Buddhadharma. These are still worldly sentiments. And yet, if we indulge
our desires and do unwholesome things, we are wholly wrongdoers. After
all, we should forget our wicked minds and our own bodies and simply do
things for the sake of the Buddhadharma. We should be careful
\[regarding this point\] when encountering each and every thing. As for
beginners in practice, whether it is worldly sentiment or human
sentiment,^[143](#calibre_link-168){#calibre_link-637 .calibre13}^
control your mind, practice good things, and do not do unwholesome
things. This is the meaning of renouncing body and mind.

While the late superintendent of monks
\[Eisai\]^[144](#calibre_link-169){#calibre_link-638 .calibre13}^ was
residing at Kennin-ji, a poor man came and said, "My family is so
destitute that we have had no food to cook for several days. My wife and
I and a few of our children are about to die of starvation. With your
compassion, please help us."

At that time there was no clothing, food, or other property in the
temple at all. Although he turned it over in his mind, he could not
think of a plan \[to help the man\]. At the time there was a small, thin
piece of copper to make the halo in the construction of a statue of the
Medicine Buddha.^[145](#calibre_link-170){#calibre_link-639 .calibre13}^
He took it, broke it, rolled it up, and gave it to the poor man, saying,
"Exchange this for food and relieve your family from hunger." The layman
was delighted and left.

\[Eisai\]'s disciples were surprised and disappointed, saying, "That is
nothing less than the halo for a Buddha statue. You gave it to a layman.
Is that not a violation of the precept against making personal use of
property belonging to the Buddha
treasure?"^[146](#calibre_link-171){#calibre_link-640 .calibre13}^

The superintendent of monks replied, "Yes, it certainly is. However,
when we think of the Buddha's intention, he would cut off and offer even
his own flesh, hands, and feet to living
beings.^[147](#calibre_link-172){#calibre_link-641 .calibre13}^ Even if
we gave the whole body of the Buddha to living beings who are actually
about to die of starvation, it would be in accord with the Buddha's
intention. And also, because of this wrongdoing, even if I have to fall
into an evil rebirth,^[148](#calibre_link-173){#calibre_link-642
.calibre13}^ I would \[still\] simply rescue living beings from
starvation." Today's students should reflect on the core of this
predecessor's heart. Never forget this.

One time, a monk who was a disciple of the superintendent of monks said,
"The current site of Kennin-ji is close to the banks of the \[Kamo\]
river.^[149](#calibre_link-174){#calibre_link-643 .calibre13}^ In the
future there could be a disastrous flood."

The superintendent of monks said, "We should not worry about the loss of
things in the future. Even at the site of the Jetavana
monastery^[150](#calibre_link-175){#calibre_link-644 .calibre13}^ in
India, only cornerstones remain. However, the merit of founding a temple
is never lost. Moreover, the virtue of practicing the Way right now,
even if only for a year or half a year, is truly enormous."

Now, as I think about this, because constructing a temple was truly a
great event in his lifetime, it would have been completely natural \[for
Eisai\] to try to avoid a future disaster. And yet, deep in his heart he
\[instead\] had a noble sentiment such as this. We should consider this
carefully.

## [3-3]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-69 .head2}

[In an evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

During the reign of Taizong of the Tang dynasty, Wei Zheng reported to
the throne, saying, "Some of the people defame Your
Majesty."^[151](#calibre_link-176){#calibre_link-645 .calibre13}^ The
emperor said, "As a humble man, if I am benevolent and yet am defamed by
the people, I do not worry. I should worry if I were praised by the
people despite lacking benevolence."

Even a layperson can have an attitude like this. We monks in particular
should have this same mental attitude. If we have compassion and the
mind of awakening, we do not need to worry about being slandered by
ignorant people. \[Only\] if they lack the mind of awakening must
\[monks\] be very careful that people regard them as people of the Way.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also instructed]{.italice}:

Emperor Wen^[152](#calibre_link-177){#calibre_link-646 .calibre13}^ of
the Sui dynasty said, "We should secretly cultivate virtue and wait
until it is revealed \[on its own\]." What he meant is that he should
nurture virtue until it is naturally expressed and then govern his
people with benevolence. If we monks do not yet have an attitude such as
his, we should be most careful. Only if we inwardly practice activities
of the Way will virtue be naturally revealed outwardly. We should not
expect or desire our mind of awakening and our virtue to be expressed
and known by other people. If we simply continue to follow the Buddha's
teachings and the ancestral Way, people will naturally take refuge in
the virtue of the Way.

[]{#calibre_link-1066 .calibre2}

Regarding this point, there is a pitfall for students: others, as well
as \[we\] ourselves, think that to be venerated by people and to amass a
large amount of property is the manifestation of our virtue of the Way.
We should know that when we think in this manner, we are possessed by
the heavenly demon Pāpīyas.^[153](#calibre_link-178){#calibre_link-647
.calibre13}^ We should consider this particularly well. In the
teachings, these are also called "the acts of a
demon."^[154](#calibre_link-179){#calibre_link-648 .calibre13}^ Among
the exemplary \[monks\] in the three
countries,^[155](#calibre_link-180){#calibre_link-649 .calibre13}^ to
this day I have never heard that wealth or veneration by ignorant people
is \[a manifestation of\] one's virtue of the Way. Since ancient times,
all people with the mind of awakening have been poor, have endured
physical pain, have wasted nothing, have been compassionate, and have
been led by the Way. Such people are called "genuine practitioners."
Manifestation of virtue does not mean we become rich in material wealth
or proud of receiving large offerings.

There are three stages in the manifestation of virtue. First, it becomes
known \[to others\] that a person is practicing the Way. Next, those who
yearn for the Way come to that person. Then, they study and practice the
Way together with that person. This is called "the manifestation of
virtue of the Way."

## [3-4]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-71 .head2}

[In an evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

Students of the Way must discard human sentiment. To discard human
sentiment means to practice in accord with the Buddhadharma. Most people
in the world have Hīnayāna
nature.^[156](#calibre_link-181){#calibre_link-650 .calibre13}^ They
discriminate good from bad, separate right and wrong, and then grasp at
"right" things and discard "wrong" things. This is still Hīnayāna
nature. If we simply give up such worldly sentiments, we enter the
Buddha Way. To enter the Buddha Way, we refrain from making judgments
based on discriminative thinking between good and evil and let go of the
mind that holds our bodies dear and the worries of our minds. Without
being concerned with good and evil, we continue to follow the words and
conduct of the buddhas and ancestors.

What we think is good in our minds and what worldly people think is good
are not necessarily good. Therefore, we follow the Buddha's teachings,
disregarding how other people see us and letting go of our own
\[discriminating\] minds. Even if it is hard on our bodies and stressful
for our minds, having determined to discard our bodies and minds, we
should practice what our venerable predecessors, the buddhas and
ancestors, have practiced. Even if we think something is good and
accords with the Buddha Way and want to practice it, do not carry it out
if it is not in accord with the mind of the buddhas and ancestors. This
means that we understand the Dharma gates well. Casting aside both our
own minds and our thoughts about those Dharma gates we have studied from
the beginning, we should turn our minds toward the words and conduct of
the buddhas and ancestors we are studying right now. When we do so, our
wisdom will progress and realization will open up. We should even
discard our understanding of what we have studied of the writings of the
teaching schools^[157](#calibre_link-182){#calibre_link-651 .calibre13}^
when there is reason to do so, and \[instead\] see things from the
perspective \[of the teachings we are studying\] right now. Studying the
Dharma gates is crucial for leaving home and attaining the Way. If, deep
in our hearts, we think that what we have accomplished with great effort
through many years of study cannot be given up easily, then such a mind
is itself bound by
life-and-death.^[158](#calibre_link-183){#calibre_link-652 .calibre13}^
We should consider this thoroughly.

## [3-5]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-73 .head2}

[In an evening]{.italice} [talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\]
[said]{.italice}:

The biography of the late superintendent of monks \[Eisai\] of Kennin-ji
was written by the Middle Councilor Harukane, a lay
monk.^[159](#calibre_link-184){#calibre_link-653 .calibre13}^ \[When he
was first asked to write the biography,\] he declined, saying, "It
should be written by a Confucian scholar. This is because Confucian
scholars forget their own bodies and devote themselves to studying from
the earliest part of their childhoods and up through maturity.
Therefore, there are no mistakes in their writing. For an ordinary
person \[like me\], serving the government and social intercourse are
the primary concerns; we study \[only\] in our spare time. Although
there are some eminent writers of the literary arts among us, our
writings can have mistakes." As I think of this \[statement\], it is
clear that the ancients forgot their bodies in order to study even
non-Buddhist texts.

The late Superintendent of Monks
\[Kō\]in^[160](#calibre_link-185){#calibre_link-654 .calibre13}^ said,
"The mind of awakening is studying the Dharma gates such as 'the three
thousand worlds in a single moment of
thought'^[161](#calibre_link-186){#calibre_link-655 .calibre13}^ and
keeping them in one's mind. This is called 'the mind of awakening.' To
meaninglessly wander around in confusion with a bamboo hat hanging
around one's neck is called an act under the demonic influence of a

[In an evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

The late superintendent of monks \[Eisai\] said, "Monks! Do not think
that I give you the clothing, food, and other provisions you use. They
are all offered by the various heavenly beings. I merely play the role
of distributor. Also, each one of you is fully endowed with an allotted
life span. Do not run around seeking after these things." He always
encouraged monks in this way. I think these are most admirable words.

Also, in great Song China, Tiantong monastery had enough provisions for
one thousand people when the assembly was under the guidance of Zen
Master Hongzhi.^[163](#calibre_link-188){#calibre_link-657 .calibre13}^
Thus, they had enough provisions to support seven hundred people inside
the monks' hall and three hundred people outside the monks' hall. And
yet, because the Elder^[164](#calibre_link-189){#calibre_link-658
.calibre13}^ was the abbot, many monks from all over the country came
like clouds to practice, and they had one thousand monks in the monks'
hall. Besides that, they had five to six hundred people outside the
hall. One of the temple officers reported back to Hongzhi, beseeching
him, "We have enough provisions for one thousand people. Because so many
monks have assembled, we do not have enough resources to support them.
Please take this into special consideration and send the extra monks
away." To this Hongzhi said, "Each one of them has his own mouth. It is
not your business. Do not concern yourself with it."

Now, considering this, each of us has a certain amount of clothing and
food granted from birth. It does not come by worrying about it, nor will
it cease to come if it is not sought after. Even laypeople leave such
things to fate, being concerned with loyalty \[to their lords\] or
cultivating filial piety \[to their parents\]. How much more should
monks, we home-leavers, be unconcerned with all other things \[outside
of practice\]. Our fortune is given to us by Shakyamuni as his
legacy;^[165](#calibre_link-190){#calibre_link-659 .calibre13}^ we also
have food and clothing offered by the heavenly deities and
arhats.^[166](#calibre_link-191){#calibre_link-660 .calibre13}^ Also, we
have the natural share of life we were allotted when we were born.
Without chasing after it or worrying over it, we should trust fate that
we will receive our allotted portion of life, which is as much as we
need. Even if we chase after and secure wealth, what will happen to it
when impermanence suddenly comes \[and we die\]? Therefore, students
must not be concerned with extraneous matters; just study the Way
single-mindedly.

Also, a certain person said, "In this age of the last
Dharma,^[167](#calibre_link-192){#calibre_link-661 .calibre13}^ and in
this land far \[from where the Buddha lived\], we want to make the
Buddhadharma flourish. If we could practice easily without worrying
about food, clothing, and so on, being supported by a patron, many
people attached to outward forms and personal benefit would come
together and study. Then, among those people, there might be one person
who arouses the mind of awakening. Therefore, find a quiet residence in
a clean place, secure provisions such as robes and food, and practice
the Buddhadharma. Then this benefit \[of one person arousing the mind of
awakening\] will reach widely."

Now, as I think about this, it cannot be so. Even if one thousand or ten
thousand people get together, if they seek after personal benefit or try
to fulfill their desires for material wealth, it is worse than no one
having come. This is because only the karma that causes one to fall into
the evil destinies^[168](#calibre_link-193){#calibre_link-662
.calibre13}^ would naturally accumulate, and there would be no
aspiration for the Buddhadharma. If we remain pure and poor and practice
the Way while enduring hardships, begging for food, eating wild nuts or
fruits, and enduring hunger, and if a single person hears about us and
comes to practice, such a person will possess the genuine mind of
awakening. I think the Buddhadharma can truly flourish in this way. To
have no \[practitioners\] because of hardships and pure poverty or
having many people gather together because of abundant food and clothing
while lacking the Buddhadharma is simply six of one, half a dozen of the
other.^[169](#calibre_link-194){#calibre_link-663 .calibre13}^

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

Many people today think that constructing images of Buddhas and building
stupas can make the Buddhadharma flourish. This is not correct. Even if
we construct huge temple buildings adorned with polished jewels and
gold, no one will attain the Way \[because of such activities\]. This is
\[instead\] nothing more than benefit \[for\] laypeople who put their
wealth into the world of the Buddha, thus allowing them to do good.
Although they might receive a great result from a small
cause,^[170](#calibre_link-195){#calibre_link-664 .calibre13}^ for monks
to be involved in such activities has nothing to do with the flourishing
of the Buddhadharma. Even within a grass hermitage or under a tree, if
we think of one single phrase of the Dharma gates or practice zazen
once, this demonstrates the true flourishing of the
Buddhadharma.^[171](#calibre_link-196){#calibre_link-665 .calibre13}^

Currently, I am appealing for donations and working as much as possible
to construct a monks' hall.^[172](#calibre_link-197){#calibre_link-666
.calibre13}^ Yet I do not think that this necessarily contributes to the
flourishing of the Buddhadharma. Only because there are currently few
people studying the Way and because I spend my days leisurely, do I
think it better to engage in these activities rather than be idle. I
hope this will enable deluded people to form a connection with the
Buddhadharma. I am working on this project for the sake of founding a
dojo^[173](#calibre_link-198){#calibre_link-667 .calibre13}^ for zazen
practice on behalf of the people studying the Way in this age. I will
have no regrets even if what I have wished for and begun might not be
realized. I do not mind if but one single pillar is erected as long as
people in later generations think that someone had the aspiration to
carry out such a project but did not complete it.

[]{#calibre_link-1296 .calibre2} []{#calibre_link-1106 .calibre2}

A person also came forward and said, "For the sake of the flourishing of
the Buddhadharma, you should visit
Kantō."^[174](#calibre_link-199){#calibre_link-668 .calibre13}^

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [replied]{.italice}:

I do not think so. If they aspired to practice the Buddhadharma, they
would come and study it even if they had to cross mountains, rivers,
lakes, and oceans. If they lack this aspiration, even if I visited them
and urged them \[to practice\], it is uncertain if they would accept it
or not. Shall I fool people merely to obtain material support for
myself? Is that not being greedy for wealth? Because it would simply
tire me out, I do not feel I need to go.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also]{.italice} [said]{.italice}:

Students of the Way! We should not read the scriptures of the teaching
schools, nor study non-Buddhist texts, and so on. We must read \[only\]
the recorded sayings \[of the Zen masters\] that require study. Put
aside all other books for the time being. Zen monks these days are fond
of studying literature as a grounding to compose verses or write Dharma
words.^[175](#calibre_link-200){#calibre_link-669 .calibre13}^ This is
wrong. Even if you cannot compose verses, just write what you think in
your mind. Even if your style is not sophisticated, write down the
Dharma gates. People without the mind of awakening will not read it if
your writing style is not well polished, but even if the style is
embellished and there are excellent phrases in it, such people would
only play with the words without grasping the principle \[behind them\].
I have been fond of studying \[literature\] since my childhood, and even
now I have a tendency to contemplate the beauty in the words of
non-Buddhist texts. Sometimes I even refer to the [Selections of Refined
Literature]{.italice}^[176](#calibre_link-201){#calibre_link-670
.calibre13}^ or other classic texts. Still, I think it is meaningless,
and it should cease immediately.

[One day]{.italice} \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

While staying at the Zen monastery in Song China, I was reading an
ancient's collection of recorded sayings. At the time, a certain monk
from Sichuan, a person of the Way, asked me, "What is the use \[of
reading recorded sayings\]?"

I said, "I will teach people after I return
home."^[177](#calibre_link-202){#calibre_link-671 .calibre13}^

The monk said, "What is the use \[of that\]?"

I said, "To benefit living beings."

The monk said, "Ultimately, what is the use?"

Later, I pondered the reason why he said this. Learning the deeds of the
ancients by reading the recorded sayings, kōan stories, and so on and
explaining them to deluded people is of no use for my own practice nor
for the teaching of others. If I devote myself to just sitting
\[[shikantaza]{.italice}\], and thereby clarify the great matter and
comprehend the principle of
mind,^[178](#calibre_link-203){#calibre_link-672 .calibre13}^ I will
later be able to teach it to others in inexhaustible ways without
knowing even one single letter. For this reason, the monk asked,
"Ultimately, what is the use?" I thought what he said was true. After
that I gave up reading the recorded sayings and other texts,
concentrated wholeheartedly on sitting, and was able to clarify the
great matter.

## [3-8]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-79 .head2}

[In an evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

Without truly having inner virtue, do not \[allow yourself to\] be
venerated by others. Because people of this country are not able to find
true inner virtue, and because they respect people based only on their
external appearances, students without the mind of awakening are easily
dragged down, becoming the kindred of demons. It is easy not to be
respected by others. However, to pretend to have abandoned the body and
to have parted from the world is only a matter of outward appearances.
One who appears to be a common worldly person but goes on harmonizing
the inner mind is a person of the true mind of awakening. Therefore, an
ancient said, "Being empty inside, following along outside." This means
to be without an ego-centered mind on the inside and getting along with
others on the outside. If we completely forget our own body and mind,
enter into the Buddhadharma, and keep practicing in accordance with the
regulations of the Buddhadharma, we will be good both inwardly and
outwardly, in the present and in the future.

Even though we have entered into the Buddhadharma, abandoning the self
and departing from the world, it is wrong to thoughtlessly abandon what
should not be abandoned. In this country, among those who are recognized
as people of the Buddhadharma or of the mind of awakening, there are
some who do not consider how others see them. They behave badly without
any reason, saying they have abandoned the self, or they do things such
as getting drenched walking in the rain, thinking they are free of
attachment to the world. \[Such behavior\] is entirely futile, both
inwardly and outwardly. Nevertheless, people in the mundane world often
consider such people to be venerable and free from attachment to the
world. On the other hand, if people maintain the regulations established
by the Buddha, keep the restraining
precepts,^[179](#calibre_link-204){#calibre_link-673 .calibre13}^
practice for themselves, and instruct others following the Buddha's
teachings, others will think that they cling to fame and profit and will
not appreciate such people. Yet for us this is the way to follow the
Buddha's teachings and cultivate inner and outer virtues.

## [3-9]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-81 .head2}

[In an]{.italice} [evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\]
[said]{.italice}:

It is of no value for a student of the Way to be known as a person of
wisdom or wide knowledge by people of the mundane world. If there is
even a single person who is sincerely seeking the Way, we should not
refuse to explain \[to them\] the Dharma of the buddhas and ancestors,
to whatever extent we know it. Even if a person has made an attempt to
kill us, if the person asks with a sincere mind to hear the true Way, we
must not hold a grudge but expound the Dharma to them. Except in these
cases, it is entirely futile to display our knowledge of the scriptures
of the exoteric or esoteric
schools^[180](#calibre_link-205){#calibre_link-674 .calibre13}^ or of
non-Buddhist texts. If someone comes to ask us about these things, we do
not need to feel shame at all in replying that we do not know. And yet,
though we may feel troubled due to being despised by others for our
ignorance, and we might even consider ourselves foolish, it is
nevertheless a terrible mistake if we study the Buddhist and
non-Buddhist classics widely \[only\] to become a person of wide
knowledge---or to study various things in order to understand mundane
things of the world and show off our knowledge. For the sake of studying
the Way, \[such pursuits\] are truly useless. Because pretending not to
know what we know is troublesome and unnatural and it, instead, creates
a respectable image, it is not good. It is best not to know from the
outset.

[]{#calibre_link-1115 .calibre2}

In my childhood, I was fond of studying classic literature on Chinese
history and other texts. Up to that point, reading both Buddhist and
non-Buddhist texts was necessary to \[go to China\] and transmit the
Dharma, and to become familiar with the local Chinese language. I
thought it was important, and in fact, it was an extraordinary thing
even in worldly society. Laypeople also appreciated it as exceptional
and wonderful. Although in a sense it was necessary, when I reflect
deeply on it now, it was a hindrance to studying the Way. When we read
Buddhist scriptures, if we understand the meaning of the sentences
phrase by phrase, we can grasp the principle expressed by the words.
However, people tend to pay more attention to the rhetorical devices,
such as couplets, rhythm, and
tone.^[181](#calibre_link-206){#calibre_link-675 .calibre13}^ They judge
them as good or bad and then think about the meaning as an afterthought.
Therefore, it is better to understand the meaning from the beginning
without caring about such things. Also, in writing Dharma words, trying
to write according to the rules of rhetoric or being unable to write
without thinking of rhyming and tone are the fault of having too much
knowledge. Let the language and style develop as they may. What is most
important is to write down in detail the truth we want to communicate.
Even though people in future generations might think that our rhetorical
technique is poor, for the Way it is essential to enable them to
understand the truth. This is the same for other fields of study as
well.

I have heard that Ku
Amidabutsu^[182](#calibre_link-207){#calibre_link-676 .calibre13}^ of
Mt. Kōya was an eminent scholar of both Exoteric and Esoteric Buddhism.
After he renounced the world^[183](#calibre_link-208){#calibre_link-677
.calibre13}^ and entered the Nenbutsu school, a Shingon priest visited
him and asked about the doctrine of the esoteric school. He replied, "I
have forgotten everything. I do not remember even a single word." Thus,
he did not answer the priest's question. This should become exemplary of
the mind of awakening. Why did he not remember even a little? Because he
did not talk about things he thought useless. I think that people who
wholeheartedly practice [nenbutsu]{.italice} must be like this.

Today's students should also have such an attitude. Even if we used to
know about the philosophies of the teaching schools, it would be better
to forget them completely. Needless to say, you should not begin
studying them now. People of the Way who truly devote themselves to
practice should not even read the collections of the recorded sayings of
our sect. You should understand this \[is also true\] of other
\[books\].

## [3-10]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-83 .head2}

[In an evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

In this country today, with regard to actions and speech, most people
are concerned with personal fame and reputation. They think \[in terms
of\] good and bad, right and wrong, and believe that if they do one
thing, others will think well of them, or if they do something else,
others will think poorly of them. They even worry about the future. This
is entirely wrong. People in worldly society are not necessarily good.
Let people think whatever they may think. Let them even say we are
madmen. If we spend our whole lives practicing in accordance with the
Buddha Way and refrain from what goes against the Buddhadharma, we need
not worry about what people think of us.

"Renunciation of the world" means being free from the sentiments of
worldly people. We should just learn about the deeds of the buddhas and
ancestors and about the compassion of the bodhisattvas, repent of our
actions in places secretly illuminated by the various heavenly beings
and guardian deities, and go on practicing in accordance with the
Buddha's regulations. We do not need to care about anything else.

On the other hand, it is wrong to shamelessly indulge ourselves and do
unwholesome things, trying to excuse ourselves on the grounds that it
does not matter if others think ill of us. Without paying attention to
how others see us, we should practice wholeheartedly in accordance with
the Buddhadharma. In the Buddhadharma, such indulgence and shamelessness
are prohibited.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

Even according to worldly etiquette, when changing clothes, when sitting
or lying down in places where no one can see us, or when in a dark room,
failing to hide what should be hidden and having no propriety is
criticized as being shameless before the heavenly beings and spirits.
Just as if someone were watching, we should hide what should be hidden
and be discreet about what requires discretion. In the Buddhadharma, the
precepts speak of the same attitude. Therefore, as practitioners of the
Way, we should not discriminate between inside and outside or between
bright and dark places. We should keep the Buddha's precepts in mind,
refraining from committing unwholesome acts even if no one may see us or
notice what we do.

## [3-11]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-85 .head2}

One day, a student asked, "Although I have been spending months and
years aspiring to learn the Way, I have not yet had any realization.
Many of the ancient masters said that \[the Buddha Way\] does not depend
on intelligence or sagacity nor require wide knowledge or
sharp-wittedness. Therefore, I do not think I should disparage myself
for my inferior capacity and lack of wisdom. Is there something about
this that has been handed down in the tradition that I should keep in
mind?"

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

You are right. \[Attaining the Way\] does not require intelligence or
talent, nor does it depend on quick-wittedness or sagacity.
\[Nonetheless,\] in the genuine study of the Way, it is a mistake to
encourage a student to become like the blind, deaf, or ignorant. Because
having a wide knowledge or great talent is not required, we should not
disparage ourselves because of our inferior capacity. True practice of
the Way should be easy.

Nevertheless, even in the monasteries of great Song China, among the
several hundreds or thousands of monks in the assembly of one master,
there are only one or two people who truly realize the Dharma and attain
the Way. Therefore, there must be some revered traditions from ancient
times \[practiced by these one or two people\] that we should keep in
mind. Now, as I consider this, \[attaining the Way\] depends on whether
one's aspiration is firmly determined or not. Those who arouse true
aspiration and study as hard as their capacity allows will not fail to
attain \[the Way\]. We have to be careful to concentrate on and
immediately carry out the following practices:

First of all, just maintain the aspiration to earnestly seek \[the
Way\]. For example, people who desire to steal a precious treasure, to
defeat a powerful enemy, or to win over a beautiful woman of high
nobility will constantly seek an opportunity to accomplish their tasks
in any situation or occasion despite \[any\] vicissitudes because their
minds are always occupied with their desire. If they are exceptionally
enthusiastic, they will not fail to fulfill their desire. In the same
way, if our aspiration to seek the Way is earnest enough when we
practice just sitting \[[shikantaza]{.italice}\], approach the kōan
stories of the ancients, or meet with our teachers, if we act with
genuine aspiration, though the target is high, we will hit the mark;
though the treasure is deep, we will fish it out. Without arousing such
an aspiration, how can we complete the great matter of the Buddha Way in
which the saṃsāra of life-and-death is cut off in a single moment? Only
if we have such a determination, without concern for our inferior
intelligence or dull faculties, or our ignorance or wickedness, will we
surely realize the Way.

[]{#calibre_link-1003 .calibre2}

Also, once we have aroused such an aspiration, we should think solely of
the impermanence of the world. This is not a matter of using some
provisional method of \[meditative\] contemplation. It is not a matter
of fabricating something in our minds that does not really exist.
\[Impermanence\] is truly the reality right in front of our eyes. We
need not wait for some teaching from others, some proof from some
passage of scripture, or some principle. Born in the morning and dead in
the evening, a person we saw yesterday is no longer here today; this is
what we see with our eyes and hear with our ears. This is what we see
and hear about others. We should apply this to ourselves and think of
the \[impermanent\] reality \[of all beings\]. Though we expect to live
for seventy or eighty years, the truth is, we must die in the end.
During our lifetime, though we may experience pleasure, sorrow, love for
our families, and hatred for our enemies, if we can untie \[the
entanglements\] of our thinking, we can spend \[our lifetime\] without
\[being bothered by such things\]. We must simply think of the Buddha
Way and seek joy for all living beings. For aged people whose lives are
already more than half over, \[this is true\] all the more: How many
years still remain? How can we slacken in our study of the Way?

\[However,\] this attitude is still not aligned with the reality \[of
impermanence\]. Consider \[this reality of impermanence\] whether it is
regarding worldly affairs or the Buddha Way. We may contract some
serious disease tomorrow or even in the next moment, or we may have to
endure pain so terrible that we are unable to distinguish east from
west. We may be suddenly struck dead by some evil spirit, encounter
trouble with brigands, or have our life taken by some sworn enemy.
Everything is truly uncertain. Therefore, in such an ephemeral world it
is extremely foolish to waste time worrying about the various means of
earning a living, expecting to live \[for a certain number of years\],
and planning \[for the future\] when our deaths are so uncertain---to
say nothing of plotting evil against others.

Precisely because this is the reality, the Buddha preached this
\[principle of impermanence\] to all living beings, and the ancestors
taught only this truth in their sermons and Dharma words. In both my
formal discourses^[184](#calibre_link-209){#calibre_link-678
.calibre13}^ and instructions, I say that impermanence is swift and
life-and-death is the great
matter.^[185](#calibre_link-210){#calibre_link-679 .calibre13}^ Reflect
on this reality again and again in your hearts without forgetting it. We
should remember that we are alive only today; we should wholeheartedly
practice the Way without wasting a moment. Other than that, \[the
practice of the Way\] is truly easy. We do not need to discuss whether
we are superior or inferior by nature, or brilliant or dull in our
capacity.

## [3-12]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-88 .head2}

[In an evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

Those who do not renounce the world seem to hold themselves dear.
However, they do not truly think of themselves. They do not consider
things from a broader perspective. Moreover, they are this way because
they have not met good teachers. Even if they think of fame, they should
\[aspire to\] obtain the fame of the buddhas and ancestors and delight
the ancient worthies and future sages. Even if they think of profit,
they should \[aspire to\] obtain the benefit of eternal bliss and the
offerings of
[nāgás]{.italice}^[186](#calibre_link-211){#calibre_link-680
.calibre13}^ and heavenly beings.

## [3-13]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-89 .head2}

[In an evening]{.italice} [talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\]
[said]{.italice}:

An ancient remarked, "If I learn the Way in the morning, I would not
mind dying in the evening."^[187](#calibre_link-212){#calibre_link-681
.calibre13}^ Today's students of the Way should have this same mental
attitude. During eons of life-and-death, how many times have we been
born and died in vain? By rare chance, we have been born in the human
world and are able to encounter the Buddhadharma. No matter what we do,
eventually we must die. Even if, in our mind, our self is dear to us, it
is not possible to hold on to it. Giving up our lives, which we must
leave behind sooner or later, for the sake of the Buddhadharma, if only
for a day or a few moments, will surely be the cause of eternal bliss.
It is regrettable to spend our days and nights vainly thinking of our
livelihood tomorrow or some later time without casting aside the world
that ought to be cast aside, without practicing the Way that ought to be
practiced. We should simply make up our mind to learn the Way following
the Buddha's intention, even \[if\] for \[just\] one day. If we do not
have the provisions to keep ourselves alive until tomorrow, it does not
matter if we die from the cold or from hunger today. First and foremost,
we need to arouse such a resolution. In doing so, we will be able to
practice the Way without fail.

Without arousing this mind \[of strong resolve\], if we outwardly
continue to practice the Buddhadharma while internally worrying about
things such as clothing for winter or summer and our livelihood for
tomorrow or the next year, then despite the appearance of practicing the
Way that runs counter to the mundane world, I do not think we will be
able to attain the Way, regardless of how many millions of years or
thousands of cycles of life-and-death we might practice. There might be
such a person, but as far as I know, such an attitude cannot be in
accordance with the teaching of the buddhas and ancestors.

Regarding the behavior of patch-robed practitioners, if we mend or patch
our old, tattered clothing instead of discarding it, it seems that we
are clinging to things. Yet to abandon old clothing and wear new robes
shows that we are seeking after new things. Both of these are mistakes.
What should we do?

I, \[Ejō,\] asked, "Ultimately, what should we keep in mind?"

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [replied]{.italice}:

So long as we are free from both greedily clinging and greedily seeking,
either is fine. Still, it would be better to mend torn clothing in order
to keep it as long as possible and not lust after new clothing.

## [3-15]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-93 .head2}

During an evening talk, Ejō asked, "Should we carry on repaying our
debts of gratitude to our fathers and
mothers?"^[188](#calibre_link-213){#calibre_link-682 .calibre13}^

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [replied]{.italice}:

Filial piety and obedience^[189](#calibre_link-214){#calibre_link-683
.calibre13}^ are most important to carry out. Yet there is a difference
between laypeople and home-leavers when it comes to performing filial
piety. Laypeople keep the teachings in the [Classic of Filial
Piety]{.italice},^[190](#calibre_link-215){#calibre_link-684
.calibre13}^ and so on, serve their parents while they are alive, and
hold services after their deaths. All worldly people know this.
Home-leavers abandon their debts of gratitude and enter the realm of
nondoing.^[191](#calibre_link-216){#calibre_link-685 .calibre13}^ Within
the family of nondoing, the manner \[of paying off debts of gratitude\]
must not be limited to one particular person. Considering that we have
debts of gratitude to all living beings just as we do to our own fathers
and mothers, we must transmit all the merits of our good deeds
throughout the \[entire\] Dharma
world.^[192](#calibre_link-217){#calibre_link-686 .calibre13}^ We do not
limit \[the dedication of merit\] specifically to our own parents and in
this \[one\] lifetime. This is how we do not violate the Way of
nondoing. In our continuous day-to-day practice and moment-to-moment
study, simply following the Buddha Way is the true fulfillment of filial
piety. Laypeople hold memorial services and make meritorious offerings
during the period between death and
rebirth.^[193](#calibre_link-218){#calibre_link-687 .calibre13}^ As
patch-robed monks, we should truly know the depth of the debt of
gratitude to our parents. \[However,\] we should see that our debts of
gratitude to all living beings are as important \[as the debt to our
parents\]. To choose one particular day to practice something especially
good and to dedicate its merit to one particular person does not seem to
accord with the Buddha's intention. The passage about the anniversaries
of the deaths of one's parents and siblings in the [Precepts]{.italice}
[Sutra]{.italice} is \[only\] a temporary \[expedient\] that applies to
laypeople.^[194](#calibre_link-219){#calibre_link-688 .calibre13}^ At
the monasteries in great Song China, monks hold ceremonies on the
anniversaries of their masters' deaths but not on the anniversaries of
their parents' deaths.

[One day]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

We say someone is dull-witted, but we are dull-witted only when we have
not yet aroused thorough aspiration. When people of worldly society fall
off a horse, a multiplicity of thoughts arise even before they hit the
ground. When some serious thing that may harm one's body or endanger
one's life occurs, no one will fail to put all one's resources and
intellect to work. On such occasions, regardless of being sharp or
dull-witted, all of us will try to discern what is best to do.

Therefore, if we think we may die tomorrow or even this evening, or we
are facing a dreadful situation, and we wholeheartedly make efforts and
encourage our aspiration, then we will never fail to attain realization.

A person who seems superficially dull-witted but has a sincere
aspiration will attain realization faster than a person who is clever in
a worldly sense. While the Tathāgata was in the world, there was a monk
whose name was Cūdapanthaka.^[195](#calibre_link-220){#calibre_link-689
.calibre13}^ Although it was difficult for him to remember and recite
even a single verse, because his aspiration was so earnest he attained
verification within one summer practice period.

Our lives exist only in this present moment. If we learn the
Buddhadharma and earnestly wish to attain realization before dying, none
of us will fail to attain it.

[One evening]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

At a Zen monastery in great Song China, they sometimes sifted the wheat,
rice, and so on by throwing away the inferior grains and keeping the
good ones to cook. This was admonished by a certain Zen master through
the use of a verse: "Even if you split my head into seven pieces, do not
winnow the rice." He meant that monks should not fuss about arranging
fine meals. They should simply eat whatever is available. When they have
fine food, they should eat it as it is. When they have only poor food,
they should eat it without disliking it. We should satisfy our hunger
and provision our lives with the faithful donations from faithful lay
supporters and the pure foods provided by temples alone, devoting
ourselves exclusively to the practice of the Way. We should not choose
good over bad on the basis of flavor. Now, each of us in this assembly
should also maintain this attitude.

Someone once asked, "How do you feel about the following view? Upon
hearing that one's own self is the Buddhadharma and that it is futile to
seek anything outside of oneself, what if students who believed this
deeply gave up their practice and studies, and spent their whole lives
doing good and bad things according to their personal nature?"

[Dōgen instructed]{.italice}:

In this point of view, there is a discrepancy between the person's words
and reality. To give up practice and abandon study because of the
futility of seeking anything outside sounds as though something is being
sought in this very act of giving up. This is not nonseeking. We simply
verify that practice and study themselves are the Buddhadharma. Without
seeking anything, we should refrain from engaging in worldly affairs and
unwholesome actions even if we are inclined to engage in them. We should
continue to study and practice the Way even if we have become languid
and weary. Even if results are attained, we should just practice
wholeheartedly without any expectation in our minds in advance. This
attitude is in accordance with the principle of nonseeking. Nanyue's
polishing of a tile to make a mirror admonished Mazu's seeking to become
a buddha.^[196](#calibre_link-221){#calibre_link-690 .calibre13}^ He did
not restrain Mazu from doing zazen.

Sitting itself is the Buddha's practice. Sitting itself is
not-doing.^[197](#calibre_link-222){#calibre_link-691 .calibre13}^ This
is itself the true form of the
Self.^[198](#calibre_link-223){#calibre_link-692 .calibre13}^ Aside from
this \[sitting\], there is no Buddhadharma that must be sought.

## [3-18]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-100 .head2}

[One day]{.italice}, [when giving instruction]{.italice},
\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

These days, many monks say that we should follow worldly customs. In my
consideration, this is not right. Even in the mundane world, wise people
say that it is impure to follow the customs of the people. For example,
Qu Yuan said, "Everyone in the world is drunk; only I am sober." He
refused to go along with the customs of the people and finally threw
himself into the Canglang River and
drowned.^[199](#calibre_link-224){#calibre_link-693 .calibre13}^
Moreover, in the Buddhadharma each and every thing is contrary to
worldly customs. Laypeople style and adorn their hair; monks shave off
their hair. Laypeople eat in abundance; monks eat once a
day.^[200](#calibre_link-225){#calibre_link-694 .calibre13}^ Everything
is contrary. And finally, \[monks\] will be people of great peace and
joy.^[201](#calibre_link-226){#calibre_link-695 .calibre13}^ For this
reason, \[the way of monks\] should be totally opposed to worldly
customs.

## [3-19]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-101 .head2}

[One day]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

As for the way the world is ordered, from the emperor down to the common
people, everyone carries out the functions of their own occupation. If
they are not suitable for their position, this is called "putting the
world into disorder." When the manner of governance is in accordance
with the will of heaven,^[202](#calibre_link-227){#calibre_link-696
.calibre13}^ the world is in good order and the people are at ease.
Therefore, the emperor wakes up at the third part of the third
watch^[203](#calibre_link-228){#calibre_link-697 .calibre13}^ to do the
work of governing the world. This is not an easy job. It is just that
the functions and the activities he must carry out are different \[from
what other people do\]. In the case of the emperor, he personally
performs the duties of governing with all his intelligence, considering
precedents from previous ages, while seeking out ministers endowed with
virtue and ability. When his way of reigning is in accordance with the
will of heaven, it is called a "well-governed world." If the emperor is
negligent in his duties, then he goes against the will of heaven, the
world becomes disordered, and the people suffer. From the emperor to the
nobility, to the high officials, to the senior officials, to the common
officials, and down to the common people, all are in charge of some
respective function. As human beings, they must execute their duties in
this way. If people go against their duties, they will receive
punishment from heaven because they have caused disorder in heaven.

Therefore, you students \[of the Buddhadharma\], even though you have
left home and renounced the world, you should not wish to lead an easy
life even for a moment. Although in the beginning it may seem
advantageous, later on it will be the cause of great harm. Following the
way of monks who have left home, we should fulfill our duties and throw
ourselves into our practice.

In governing the mundane world, even if \[the emperor\] pursues
precedents and seeks out virtuous and capable \[ministers\], because
there is no certain way that has been handed down by the ancient sages
or past leaders, naturally he might make mistakes. For the children of
the Buddha, however, there are definite precedents and scriptural
teachings. There are also masters who have received the transmission of
such traditions. \[Furthermore,\] we are capable of thought. In each of
the four dignified actions,^[204](#calibre_link-229){#calibre_link-698
.calibre13}^ if we think of precedents and follow our predecessors in
our practice, there is no reason to fail in attaining the Way. Laypeople
wish to be in accordance with the will of heaven, while patch-robed
monks practice to be in harmony with the will of the Buddha. The tasks
are the same, but the results \[for Buddhists\] are superior. This is
because the great peace and joy, which is never lost once attained,
depends only upon having the aspiration to make this phantom-like body
follow the will of the Buddha in this lifetime.

Nevertheless, the Buddha's teachings also never compel us to subject our
body to meaningless suffering or to do something that should not be
done. If we follow the demeanor and behavior prescribed in the precepts,
our body will be at ease, our behavior will be appropriate, and we will
not disturb others. Therefore, we should abandon any self-centered views
we now have and thoroughly follow the Buddha's precepts.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

When I was staying at Tiantong Zen monastery in great Song China, while
the old master Rujing was the abbot there, we did zazen until the third
part of the second watch^[205](#calibre_link-230){#calibre_link-699
.calibre13}^ and got up at about the second or third part of the fourth
watch^[206](#calibre_link-231){#calibre_link-700 .calibre13}^ to do
zazen. The old master sat with the assembly in the monks' hall. He never
took even a single night off. While sitting, many monks fell asleep. The
old master walked around hitting them with his fist or his clog,
scolding them and compelling them to wake up. If they continued to
sleep, he went to the illuminated
hall,^[207](#calibre_link-232){#calibre_link-701 .calibre13}^ rang the
bell, and called his attendants to light the candles. On the spur of the
moment he would give an informal sermon, saying, for example, "What is
the use of sleeping in vain while you are gathered together in the
monks' hall? Why did you leave home to become a monk and enter this
monastery? Do you not see how the emperor and government officials work
in the world? Who among them leads an easy life? The emperor righteously
administers justice, the ministers serve with loyalty, and so on, down
to the commoners who cultivate the rice fields holding their hoes. Who
leads an easy life without laboring? You have avoided these labors and
entered a monastery, but you now spend your time wastefully. What on
earth is the point of it? Life-and-death is the great matter. Everything
is impermanent and changes swiftly. The teaching schools and the Zen
schools both emphasize this and encourage \[us to practice diligently\].
You may die this evening or tomorrow morning. \[You have no idea\] when
and how your death may come or what kind of sickness you may contract.
It is utterly foolish to pass the time while you are alive sleeping or
meaninglessly lying down, failing to practice the Buddhadharma. It is
because you practice like this that the Buddhadharma is declining. When
the Buddhadharma flourished in monasteries throughout the country,
people devotedly did zazen. In recent times, the Buddhadharma is falling
into decay because no masters in the various monasteries promote
sitting."

I personally saw him encouraging the monks in his assembly with such
reasoning and making them do zazen. Today's students should also think
of his style of practice.

Also, his lead attendant and others once beseeched him, saying, "The
monks in the monks' hall are tired and sleepy. They may fall ill or lose
their aspiration because of the long hours of sitting. Please shorten
the time of zazen." The old master strictly admonished them, saying, "We
must never do that. People without the mind of awakening temporarily
staying in the monks' hall would sleep even if we sat for only half an
hour or less. Practitioners with the mind of awakening who aspire to
practice are happier the longer they are able to sit and, therefore,
practice much harder. When I was young, I visited various teachers in
different regions. They all encouraged monks in this way and hit them so
hard that they almost broke their fists. But since I am now old and
weak, I can no longer hit the monks so hard. Consequently, no good monks
develop. Because the elders at the various monasteries are lenient about
sitting, the Buddhadharma is falling into decay. We must hit them all
the more!"

## [3-20]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-103 .head2}

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

Is the Way attained with the mind or the body? In the teaching schools,
it is said that because body and mind are not separate, the Way is
attained \[not only with the mind but also\] with the
body.^[208](#calibre_link-233){#calibre_link-702 .calibre13}^ Yet it is
not clear that we attain the Way with the body, because they say body
and mind are not separate. Now, in my \[Dharma\] family, the Way is
\[truly\] attained with both body and mind. As long as we only think
about the Buddhadharma with our minds, we will never grasp the Way, even
in a thousand lifetimes or ten thousand eons. When we let go of our
minds and put aside our views and understandings, the Way will be
actualized. \[One person\] clarified the mind by seeing the color \[of
peach blossoms\], and another realized the Way by hearing the sound \[of
a piece of tile hitting
bamboo\].^[209](#calibre_link-234){#calibre_link-703 .calibre13}^ They
attained the Way with their bodies. Therefore, when we completely cast
aside our thoughts and views and just sit \[[shikantaza]{.italice}\], we
will become intimate with the Way. For this reason, the Way is truly
attained with the body.^[210](#calibre_link-235){#calibre_link-704
.calibre13}^ This is why I think we should wholeheartedly practice
zazen.

Students of the Way! We should cast
away^[211](#calibre_link-237){#calibre_link-705 .calibre13}^ our body
and mind and completely enter the Buddhadharma. An ancient said, "At the
top of a hundred-foot pole, take one step
further."^[212](#calibre_link-238){#calibre_link-706 .calibre13}^ When
we have climbed to the top of the one-hundred-foot pole, we certainly
think that we will die if we let go of our foothold, and we have a
mental tendency to hold fast to the pole. Making up our mind to "take
one step further" means \[to enter the Buddhadharma\]. Having resolved
to \[take this step\] and thinking it cannot be bad, we should give up
everything as if casting away \[body and mind\], from our profession to
our livelihood. \[And yet,\] it is extremely difficult for us to discard
these things. Unless we give them up, even if we appear to practice the
Way arduously, as though attempting to extinguish a fire enveloping our
heads,^[213](#calibre_link-239){#calibre_link-707 .calibre13}^ it is not
possible to attain the Way. Make the determination to cast away both
body and mind.

One time, a nun asked, "Even women in lay society study the
Buddhadharma. As for nuns \[who have left the mundane world\], even if
we have some faults, I feel there is no reason we \[unlike laywomen\]
are not in accord with Buddhadharma. What do you think?"

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

\[What you said\] is not right. Although there are some laywomen who
study the Buddhadharma and attain it \[as laypeople\], home-leavers who
lack the mind of home-leaving cannot attain the Way. It is not that the
Buddhadharma discriminates among people, but \[rather that such\] people
do not enter the Buddhadharma. There must be a difference in the mental
attitude between people in laity and home-leavers. Laypeople who have
the mind of home-leaving can be released \[from saṃsāra\]. \[On the
other hand,\] if home-leavers have the mind of laity, they double their
faults. Their mental attitudes should be quite different. It is not that
\[becoming a home-leaver\] is difficult to do. \[However,\] to do so
completely is difficult. It seems that everyone seeks a practice to be
released \[from saṃsāra\] and attain the Way, but those who completely
accomplish it are difficult \[to find\]. Life-and-death is the great
matter; impermanence is
swift.^[214](#calibre_link-240){#calibre_link-708 .calibre13}^ Do not
let your mind slacken. If you renounce the world, you should truly
renounce it. I think the provisional names \[of "home-leavers" and
"laypeople"\] are not at all important.

## [4-3]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-109 .head2}

[In an evening talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

Among the laity, I see that people who have good
fortune^[215](#calibre_link-241){#calibre_link-709 .calibre13}^ and have
enabled their families to prosper are all honest and work for the
benefit of others. Therefore, they are able to maintain their family
prosperity, and their descendents will not die out in later generations.
Even if those who are dishonest or those who harm others seem to
temporarily receive good fortune and are able to maintain their
livelihood for a while, in the end their prosperity will decline. Even
if such people seem to spend their lifetimes without trouble, their
descendents will not necessarily be fortunate.

Furthermore, when we do good things for others, if we do so because of
our desire to be thought well of, or to ingratiate ourselves with
others, even though this is better than doing harmful things, such
actions are not truly for the benefit of others because we are still
thinking of the benefit to ourselves. If we do helpful things for others
although they do not notice, or we do beneficial things for future
generations without considering whom our acts may benefit, \[then\] we
are truly doing good things for others.

Needless to say, we patch-robed monks should maintain a mind beyond even
this attitude. We should have compassion for all living beings without
making distinctions based on degree of intimacy and maintain an attitude
of saving all beings equally. We should never think of our own personal
profit in terms of benefit in either the mundane or transcendent
world.^[216](#calibre_link-242){#calibre_link-710 .calibre13}^ Even if
we are neither known nor appreciated by others, we should simply perform
beneficial actions for others in accord with our own heart and not let
others know that we have such a heart.

The ancient practice \[for keeping this attitude\] is, first of all,
renouncing the world and casting aside the self. Only if we have truly
thrown away the self will we have no desire to be well thought of by
others. However, if we think, "I do not care what others may think," and
we act unwholesomely or become self-indulgent, we instead go against the
will of the Buddha. We should simply perform wholesome actions and do
beneficial things for others. We should not think about the return or
expect to gain a good reputation. We should do things truly knowing
there is nothing to be gained and work for the sake of benefiting
others. This is the primary point to bear in mind in order to achieve
release from our ego-clinging.

To maintain this mind \[of no desire for gain\], we must first of all be
mindful of impermanence. One's lifetime is like a dream. Time passes
swiftly. Our dew-like lives will disappear even before the dawn. While
we are alive for this short time, we must resolve to perform beneficial
actions for others and follow the will of the Buddha.

## [4-4]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-111 .head2}

[In an evening]{.italice} [talk]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\]
[said]{.italice}:

Students of the Way should, most importantly, be poor. Looking at people
in the mundane world, to start with, those who possess wealth will
certainly have two kinds of difficulties: anger and shame. If they have
wealth, other people will want to take it. Not wanting \[their
possessions\] to be stolen, anger immediately arises. They would perhaps
have arguments regarding the matter \[of their wealth being taken\] and
eventually start a lawsuit or a confrontation that could escalate into a
fight or battle.^[217](#calibre_link-243){#calibre_link-711 .calibre13}^
Within such processes, anger arises, and shameful situations may occur.
If we live in poverty and lack greed, we are likely to be spared such
troubles. We can be peaceful, joyful, and free. The evidence is right in
front of our eyes. We do not need to find proof in the scriptures.
Furthermore, our predecessors and the worthies to come criticize
\[having wealth\], and the various heavenly beings, buddhas, and
ancestors all denounce it. Therefore, to thoughtlessly amass wealth,
give way to anger, and become a foolish person is the most shameful of
shameful things. Those who are in poverty and yet yearn for the Way
bring delight to the buddhas and ancestors and unseen heavenly beings,
and are respected by the ancient worthies and wise saints to come.

We can see the decline of the Buddhadharma right before our eyes.
\[Compared with\] when I first entered Kennin-ji monastery, seven or
eight years later things had gradually
changed:^[218](#calibre_link-244){#calibre_link-712 .calibre13}^
\[monks\] had built storerooms in each temple building and had a variety
of possessions; they liked luxurious clothing, owned property, and
indulged in meaningless conversations; they did not care about the forms
of greeting one another^[219](#calibre_link-245){#calibre_link-713
.calibre13}^ nor about making prostrations \[before the Buddha\].
Considering these things, I can only imagine what has happened in other
monasteries.

People of the Buddhadharma should not possess anything aside from robes
and a begging bowl. What do they need to store when they make
storerooms? We should not own anything that we have to hide from others.
Rather, when we do not possess anything, we can be at ease. When we are
compelled to kill so as not to be killed, we suffer, and our minds are
anxious. When we make up our minds not to retaliate even if someone
tries to kill us, we need not be on guard or worry about thieves. We
will never fail to be filled with peace and joy.

[One day]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

While Zen Master Haimen^[220](#calibre_link-246){#calibre_link-714
.calibre13}^ was the abbot of Tiantong monastery in Song China, there
was a head monk in his assembly named
Yuan.^[221](#calibre_link-247){#calibre_link-715 .calibre13}^ This
person had attained the Dharma and realized the Way. He had surpassed
even the abbot himself.

One night, \[before he was head monk, Yuan\] visited the abbot's room,
offered incense, gave prostrations, and asked, "I request that you
appoint me the head monk of the rear
hall."^[222](#calibre_link-248){#calibre_link-716 .calibre13}^

\[Hai\]men shed tears, and said, "Since the time I was a novice, I have
never heard of such a thing. You, as a Zen monk, request \[the position
of\] head monk or abbot. You have already realized the Way. Looking back
at previous masters, I can see that you have surpassed me. Do you seek
the position of the head monk for the sake of promotion? I would have
allowed you to be \[the head monk of\] the front hall or even the abbot.
\[From your behavior\] I can only imagine how other monks who have not
yet realized the Way might be. The decline of the Buddhadharma can be
seen from this." Saying so, he shed tears and wept with sorrow.

Although the monk \[Yuan\] left ashamed of himself and declined the
position, \[the abbot went on and\] appointed him as the head monk.
Later, the head monk recorded this conversation, shaming himself and
praising his master's excellent words.

Now that I think about this, I see that the ancients put people to shame
if \[such people\] wanted to make themselves important, to become the
head of things, or to attain the position of abbot. We should just
aspire to realize the Way without being concerned with anything else.

[One evening]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

After his enthronement,
Taizong^[223](#calibre_link-249){#calibre_link-717 .calibre13}^ of the
Tang dynasty lived in an old palace. Because it was damaged, it became
damp, wind and mist entered into it, and the emperor's health was at
risk of being harmed. When his ministers made a proposal to build a new
palace, the emperor said, "This is the busy farming season. The people
will certainly be distressed \[if construction begins now\]. We should
wait until autumn to build. Being afflicted by moisture is due to not
being accepted by the earth; being afflicted by wind and rain is due to
not living in accordance with heaven. If I go against heaven and earth,
I cannot keep my body \[healthy\]. If I do not cause the people trouble,
I will be in accordance with heaven and earth. If \[my conduct\] is in
harmony with heaven and earth, my body will not be damaged." So saying,
he did not construct a new palace, and ultimately, he continued to live
in the old one.

Furthermore, we as the Buddha's children should maintain the family
tradition of the Tathāgata and have compassion toward all living beings
as if each of them were our only
child.^[224](#calibre_link-250){#calibre_link-718 .calibre13}^ Even if
they are our attendants or servants, do not scold them and cause them
trouble. Moreover, we should respect and venerate our copractitioners,
seniors, and elders as if we were venerating the Tathāgata. This is
clearly written in the precepts. Therefore, today's students should also
consider doing beneficial things for others without making distinctions
between people of the upper and lower classes, or the intimate and
unrelated, even if their deeds are not seen and not known to others.

Whether it be a big or small matter, we should not trouble people and
hurt their feelings.

While the Tathāgata was in the world, there were many non-Buddhists who
slandered him, and some even hated him. A disciple of the Buddha said,
"From the beginning, you have been gentle and compassionate in your
heart. All living beings should venerate you equally. What is the reason
some people do not follow your teachings?" The Buddha said, "In \[my\]
past lives, when I led many people in my assembly, I often admonished my
disciples by scolding them and finding fault with them. Because of
\[these past misdeeds\], things like this happen in the present." This
conversation can be found in the Vinaya precepts. Therefore, even when
we as abbots or elders lead a group of practitioners, we should not use
abusive or critical words to admonish our disciples and scold them. If
we use gentle words to admonish or encourage them, people who \[have the
aspiration to\] follow will follow. Needless to say, patch-robed monks
should never harbor hatred and scold copractitioners using abusive
language, whether they are closely related or not. We should be very
careful about this.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

To have the mental attitude of a patch-robed monk, we should observe the
conduct of the buddhas and ancestors. First of all, we should not be
greedy for wealth. As we can surmise from the parables, the Tathāgata
had deep and great compassion. Everything he did was for the sake of all
living beings. He never did even the slightest thing that was not for
the benefit of living beings. What is the reason I say so? The Buddha
was the crown prince of the wheel-turning
king.^[225](#calibre_link-251){#calibre_link-719 .calibre13}^ \[If the
Buddha had become king,\] he could have ruled the world as he wished. He
could have taken care of his disciples with his wealth or fostered them
in his fiefdom. Why did he give this up to practice begging on his own?
He did not accumulate wealth and practiced begging for food because it
was certain to be more beneficial for people in the age of the last
Dharma^[226](#calibre_link-252){#calibre_link-720 .calibre13}^ and also
for his disciples' practice of the Way. Since then, ancestral masters in
India and China as well as well-known practitioners have all practiced
begging for food while \[living\] in great poverty.

Furthermore, all of the ancestors in our tradition have emphasized not
storing up wealth. Even in the teaching
schools,^[227](#calibre_link-253){#calibre_link-721 .calibre13}^ when
people praise our school they primarily speak well of this \[style of
frugality\]. The writers of the biographies of monks have also honored
\[Zen monks\] for this \[style of practice\]. I have never heard of
anyone who was rich in material wealth practicing the Buddhadharma. All
eminent practitioners of the Buddhadharma have lived only with a patched
robe and have always practiced begging. From the time when the Zen
school first arose, when Zen monks stayed at the temples belonging to
the teaching schools or the Vinaya school, they were considered to be
good monks that were different from other monks because they abandoned
\[attachment to\] the self and lived in
poverty.^[228](#calibre_link-254){#calibre_link-722 .calibre13}^
Regarding the family tradition of this school, we must primarily
remember this point. We do not need to look for written proof within the
sacred scriptures. There was a time when I myself owned an estate, and
so forth. There was a time when I possessed material wealth as
well.^[229](#calibre_link-255){#calibre_link-723 .calibre13}^ Comparing
the condition of my body and mind at that time with my present condition
of poverty, of possessing just robes and a bowl, I feel that my current
state of mind is superior. This is the actual proof.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

An ancient said, "Do not speak of a person's conduct if you are not
empathizing with them." This means that if we have not perceived and
understood others' virtues, we should not criticize them when we see
their faults, but rather we should think that they are good and it is
just their actions that are bad; even good people do things that seem
bad. We should acknowledge only people's virtues, not their faults. The
saying "a wise person sees another's virtues and not their faults" means
the same thing.

We should not fail to do good in secret. \[If we do good in secret\] we
will surely receive unseen protection and clear reward. We should
venerate Buddha images, even if they are crude, molded statues made of
clay and wood. We should take refuge in the teachings of the sutras even
if they are written on coarse scrolls made of yellow paper attached to a
red rod.^[230](#calibre_link-256){#calibre_link-724 .calibre13}^ We
should have faith and respect monkhood even if there are shameless monks
who violate the precepts. If we venerate them and prostrate ourselves
with faith in our heart, we will surely receive clear blessings.
Although we might encounter shameless monks or coarse sutra scrolls, if
we do not have faith in them, and treat them disrespectfully, we will
certainly receive punishment. Thus, if we take refuge in them and
venerate them, we will receive benefit, but if we are faithless, we will
receive punishment. No matter how uncommonly crude \[some of its
aspects\] may be, we should venerate the world of the Three Treasures.
It is extremely wrong to be fond of committing evil deeds under the
pretext that a Zen monk does not need to practice good or seek virtues.
By the standards of the past I have never heard of any of our
predecessors who indulged in evil deeds such as these.

Zen Master Danxia Tianran^[231](#calibre_link-257){#calibre_link-725
.calibre13}^ burned a wooden statue of the Buddha. Although it seemed to
be nothing but an evil deed, his actions were a skillful means of
expressing the Dharma. When we read the record of this master's
behavior, we find that his sitting was always in accordance with the
prescribed standard and while standing he always followed good manners.
He always behaved courteously as if he were meeting a noble guest. Even
when he sat for a short while, he sat cross-legged, and \[when he
stood\] he held his hands in
[shashu]{.italice}.^[232](#calibre_link-258){#calibre_link-726
.calibre13}^ He protected temple property as though caring for his own
eyes.^[233](#calibre_link-259){#calibre_link-727 .calibre13}^ He never
failed to offer encouragement when he saw someone practicing diligently.
He valued good deeds even if they were small. His behavior in his daily
life was excellent. To this day, the record of his deeds remains as a
good example in Zen monasteries.

Not only this Zen master but all the virtuous masters who have attained
the Way and the ancestors who realized the Way and who have been
respected as our models, all of them maintained the behavior prescribed
by the precepts and conducted themselves with dignity. They appreciated
even minor good deeds. I have never heard of any master of the Way who
disregarded good actions. Students of the Way! If you wish to follow the
Way of the ancestors, you should never make light of good actions. We
should wholeheartedly trust the Buddha's teachings. All good accumulates
where the Way of the buddhas and ancestors is practiced. Once you have
clarified that all Dharmas are the Buddhadharma, you should still know
that evil is definitely evil and that it causes us to depart from the
Way of the buddhas and ancestors. Good is always good and connects us
with the Buddha Way. If we know that this is so, how can we not value
\[all aspects of\] the world of the Three Treasures?

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

Now, if we wish to practice the Way of the buddhas and ancestors, we
should practice the Way of the previous sages and emulate the conduct of
the ancestors \[while\] expecting nothing, seeking nothing, and
attaining nothing. We should cut off our desire for seeking; we should
not expect even the fruit of Buddhahood. Nevertheless, if we stop
practicing and remain engaged in our former evil deeds, we will be
guilty of seeking, and we will remain in our
nest.^[234](#calibre_link-260){#calibre_link-728 .calibre13}^ Solely for
the sake of becoming the foundation of happiness for human and heavenly
beings and without having the slightest of expectations, we should
maintain the prescribed manner of conduct, think of acting to save and
benefit living beings, and earnestly perform all good deeds while giving
up our former evil ones. Without stagnating in the good deeds of the
present, we should continue to practice throughout our lifetime. An
ancient called this "breaking the bottom of the pail of
lacquer."^[235](#calibre_link-261){#calibre_link-729 .calibre13}^ The
conduct of buddhas and ancestors is like this.

[One day]{.italice}, [on the occasion of a monk]{.italice} [visiting and
asking about points to watch in practicing the]{.italice}
[Way]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Students of the Way should first of all be poor. If we have much wealth,
we will definitely lose the aspiration \[to practice\]. Those who study
the Way as home-dwellers are still bound by their wealth; they greedily
indulge in their houses and associate with their families and relatives.
Even if they have the aspiration \[to practice\], they will have many
obstacles in practicing the Way. Since ancient times there have been
many laypeople who visited \[Zen masters to practice\]; however, even if
they were good practitioners, they could still not be the equals of
monks. Because monks do not possess any property at all except for one
robe and one bowl,^[236](#calibre_link-262){#calibre_link-730
.calibre13}^ they do not worry about a place to live, nor do they
greedily indulge in food and clothing. They single-mindedly study the
Way. All those monks attained benefits concomitant with their
capacities. This is because to be poor is to be intimate with the Way.

Although Mr. Pang^[237](#calibre_link-263){#calibre_link-731
.calibre13}^ was a layperson, he became well known as an equal to the
monks within the community of Zen practitioners. The reason for this is
as follows. When he first started to practice Zen, he took all of his
family wealth and was about to cast it into the ocean.

People tried to persuade him not to do so, saying, "Why do you not give
the property to others or spend it for the sake of Buddhist affairs?"

He replied to them, "I am throwing it away because I believe it is
harmful. How can I give it to others? Wealth is a harmful enemy that
troubles our bodies and minds." In the end, he threw it into the ocean.
After that, he made and sold bamboo baskets to earn his living. Even
though he was a layperson, because he threw away all of his property in
this way he was considered a person of Zen. Monks, moreover, should give
up their property completely.

A monk said, "In China, monasteries have provisions belonging to the
community and \[communal\] permanent property. These can be helpful to
support monks to practice the Way. They do not need to worry \[about
their livelihoods\]. In this country, we do not have such
\[provisions\]. If we completely give up \[our property\], there will
surely be obstacles in practicing the Way. I think it is better to
consider some provisioning of clothing and food in advance. What do you
think?"^[238](#calibre_link-264){#calibre_link-732 .calibre13}^

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

It is not so. More than in China, people in this country give support
that is more than reasonable and make offerings to monks beyond their
means. I do not know about others, but I have experienced this and found
it to be true. I have spent more than ten years without any possessions,
and I have never worried about how to obtain
them.^[239](#calibre_link-265){#calibre_link-733 .calibre13}^ It is a
great obstacle to think of storing up even a little bit of property.
Without having to think of how to gain or store things in advance, we
will naturally receive as much as we need just to stay alive. Each
person has their own allotted share. Heaven and earth bestow it upon us.
Even though we do not run around seeking it, we will receive it without
fail. Needless to say, children of the Buddha will receive the blessings
that are the legacy of the
Tathāgata.^[240](#calibre_link-266){#calibre_link-734 .calibre13}^ We
will gain them without seeking. These things will naturally occur only
if we wholeheartedly practice the Way. \[My own ability to live in this
way\] is actual proof.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

Students of the Way often say that if they do certain things, people in
the world will speak ill of them. This is totally wrong. No matter how
badly people slander us, we must practice in accordance with the conduct
of the buddhas and ancestors or what is taught in the sacred scriptures.
Even if everyone in the world praises us, we should neither practice
things that conflict with the principles of the sacred teachings nor
\[practice\] those things that the ancestral teachers did not do.

This is because when we face death, no person of the \[mundane\] world
can save us from proceeding toward an evil destiny. We will be pulled by
our bad karma, whether they are close \[to us\] or strangers, whether
they praise us or slander us, and even if we follow their opinions. Even
if we are reproached and hated by every one of them, if we practice
according to the Way of the buddhas and ancestors, unseen beings will
surely help us. For this reason, we should not cease practicing the Way
even if worldly people speak ill of us. Also, those who slander or
praise us are not necessarily people who have penetrated the Buddha Way
and attained verification. How is it possible to judge the Way of the
buddhas and ancestors from \[the worldly standards of\] good and bad?
Therefore, do not follow the sentiments of worldly people. If there is a
reason for an action to be carried out according to the Buddha Way, then
we should carry it out wholeheartedly.

Also, a monk said, "My aged mother is still alive. I am her only child.
She lives relying solely on my financial support. Her affection for me
is especially deep. My desire to fulfill my filial duties is also deep.
I am somewhat engaged in worldly affairs and have relationships with
people; with their kind help I obtain clothing and food for my mother.
If I renounced the world and lived in seclusion, I could not expect my
mother to live for even one day. For this reason I stay in the mundane
world. \[On the other hand,\] it is also difficult for me not to
completely enter the Buddha Way. If there is still a reason for me to
abandon \[my mother\] and enter the Way, what is it?"

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

This is a difficult matter. No one else can deal with it for you. After
carefully considering it, if you truly aspire to enter the Buddha Way,
it would be good for both you and your mother to somehow prepare or find
a means to ensure your mother's livelihood before entering the Buddha
Way. You will definitely attain what you earnestly wish for. If you wish
to defeat a strong enemy, to gain favor with some noble lady, or to
obtain some precious treasure, if your desire is strong enough you will
surely find some method to attain what you
wish.^[241](#calibre_link-267){#calibre_link-735 .calibre13}^ It will
certainly be achieved with the unseen help of the beneficent deities of
heaven and earth.

The Sixth Ancestor of Caoxi was a woodcutter in Xinzhou
province.^[242](#calibre_link-268){#calibre_link-736 .calibre13}^ He
sold firewood to support his mother. One day at the marketplace he
aroused the mind of awakening when he heard a customer recite the
[Diamond Sutra]{.italice}. Then he left his mother and went to
Huangmei^[243](#calibre_link-269){#calibre_link-737 .calibre13}^ \[to
visit the Fifth Ancestor\]. It is said that he obtained thirty ounces of
silver^[244](#calibre_link-270){#calibre_link-738 .calibre13}^ and used
it to supply clothing and food for his mother. I think that was given
from heaven because of the sincerity of his aspiration. Ponder this
point thoroughly. \[If you can find such aid,\] this is one reasonable
way.

Regarding your mother, waiting until the end of her lifetime and then
entering the Buddha Way without any obstacles would seem to be the
natural order of events and the ideal way of fulfilling your true
aspiration. Yet no one knows what will happen, for there is no certainty
that an old person will die sooner than a young person. Your mother may
live a long time, and you may die before her. In such a case, because
your plan would not have worked, you would regret not having entered the
Buddha Way, and your mother would feel guilty for not having permitted
you to do so. There would be no merit for either of you, and both of you
would have feelings of guilt. Would that be of any value?

If you abandon your present life and enter the Buddha Way, even if your
mother had to die of starvation, would it not be better for you to form
a connection with the Way and for her to permit her only son to enter
the Way? Although it is most difficult to cast aside filial love, even
over eons and many lifetimes, having been born in a human body, if you
give up \[filial love\] in this lifetime, when you encounter the
Buddha's teachings you will be truly fulfilling your debt of
gratitude^[245](#calibre_link-271){#calibre_link-739 .calibre13}^ \[to
your parents\]. Why would this not be in accordance with the Buddha's
will? It is said that if one child leaves home to become a monk, seven
generations of parents will attain the
Way.^[246](#calibre_link-272){#calibre_link-740 .calibre13}^ How can you
waste an opportunity for eternal peace and joy by clinging to your body
in this uncertain and ephemeral world? Consider this, and ponder these
points thoroughly for yourself.

[One day]{.italice}, [on the occasion]{.italice} [of a study
meeting]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Students of the Way! We should not cling to our personal views. Even
when we have some understanding, we should still think that there might
be something not right \[with our views\], or that there might be
insights that are superior \[to our opinions\]. We should visit widely
with a variety of teachers, and we should investigate our predecessors'
words. Furthermore, we should not firmly adhere even to the sayings of
our predecessors. \[We should\] consider that their words might be
mistaken, or even if we believe them, if there is superior
understanding, we should gradually develop our own understanding.

Long ago, a certain imperial attendant
monk^[247](#calibre_link-274){#calibre_link-741 .calibre13}^ visited the
assembly of National Teacher
Zhong.^[248](#calibre_link-275){#calibre_link-742 .calibre13}^ The
national teacher asked him, "What color are the grasses in the south?"
The monk said, "Yellow." He also asked a boy who was there, and the boy
replied the same way: "Yellow." Then the national teacher said to the
attendant monk, "Your view is not superior to the boy's. You said
yellow. The boy also said yellow. You and the boy have the same view. If
so, the boy could be the emperor's teacher and answer with the true
color. Your view is not beyond the
ordinary."^[249](#calibre_link-276){#calibre_link-743 .calibre13}^

[]{#calibre_link-1063 .calibre2}

Years later someone commented, "What is wrong with the fact that the
attendant monk's view is not beyond the ordinary? He said the true color
just as the boy did. The attendant monk must be a true teacher." So
saying, he did not accept the national teacher's opinion.

From this, we understand that, just as \[this person\] did not accept
the ancient's opinion, we \[too\] should simply understand the true
reality \[rather than accepting the view of an authority\]. Even though
a doubtful mind is bad, it is also bad to cling to something we should
not believe and to not investigate what should be investigated.

## [5-2]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-127 .head2}

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also]{.italice} [instructed]{.italice}:

The primary concern for students \[of the Way\] must be, first of all,
to detach ourselves from personal
views.^[250](#calibre_link-277){#calibre_link-744 .calibre13}^ To detach
from our personal views is to not cling to our bodies. Even if we
penetrate the sayings and stories of the ancients and sit unceasingly
like iron or a rock, if we attach to our bodies without letting go, we
will not be able to attain the Way of the buddhas and ancestors \[, even
if we practice\] for ten thousand eons or thousands of lifetimes. It
goes without saying that even if we are able to understand the
provisional or genuine teachings, or the sacred teachings of the
exoteric or esoteric
scriptures,^[251](#calibre_link-278){#calibre_link-745 .calibre13}^ but
we are not free from the mind that clings to our bodies, we vainly
calculate others' wealth without owning even a halfpenny of our
own.^[252](#calibre_link-279){#calibre_link-746 .calibre13}^ I only ask
you, students, to sit quietly and investigate the beginning and the end
of this body from the basis of reality. Our body, hair, and skin
originally comprised the two droplets from our father and mother. When
our breath stops, they will disperse and finally turn into mud and soil
on the mountains and fields. How can we cling to our
bodies?^[253](#calibre_link-280){#calibre_link-747 .calibre13}^
Furthermore, when we see from the basis of the Dharma, we are \[nothing
but\] the gathering and dispersing of the eighteen
elements.^[254](#calibre_link-281){#calibre_link-748 .calibre13}^ Which
one can we identify as ourselves? Although there are differences between
the teaching schools^[255](#calibre_link-282){#calibre_link-749
.calibre13}^ and the \[Zen\] school \[that is\] outside the teaching,
they both show the ungraspability of the self from the beginning to the
end and make this truth the \[basic\] attitude toward practicing the
Way. On this point, both are the same. First of all, we must penetrate
this truth. Then, the Buddha Way will become truly clear.

An ancient said, "When we walk in the mist, without knowing it our
clothing becomes moist."^[256](#calibre_link-283){#calibre_link-750
.calibre13}^ If we keep company with good people, we will unwittingly
become a good person. Long ago, the attendant boy who served Master
Juzhi,^[257](#calibre_link-284){#calibre_link-751 .calibre13}^ without
knowing that he was studying and practicing, realized the Way because he
had been closely attending the long-experienced practitioner. Zazen is
the same. With zazen also, if you do it for a long time, naturally the
time will come when you suddenly clarify the great matter, and you will
know that zazen is the true gate \[to the Buddhadharma\].

I have appointed the first head monk, and today, I allow him to take the
whisk \[to give a talk\]. Do not be afraid of the small number of people
\[in this assembly\]. Do not be concerned that you are a beginner. At
Fenyang, they had only six or seven people; at Yaoshan, they had less
than ten people.^[264](#calibre_link-291){#calibre_link-758 .calibre13}^
However, they practiced the Way of the buddhas and ancestors. \[They\]
were considered to be flourishing monasteries.

Do you not see that \[Xiangyan Zhixian\] realized the Way upon hearing
the sound of \[a piece of tile hitting\] bamboo, and \[Lingyun Zhiqin\]
clarified the mind upon seeing peach
blossoms?^[265](#calibre_link-292){#calibre_link-759 .calibre13}^ Are
there any bamboos that are sharp or dull-witted, deluded or enlightened?
Are there blossoms that are shallow or deep, wise or foolish? Blossoms
bloom every year, but not everyone realizes the Way. Bamboos often make
sounds, but not all of the hearers verify the Way. Only through the
virtues of long-term study and continuous practice, with the condition
of diligent effort in the wholehearted practice of the Way, do we
realize the Way and clarify the mind. These things did not occur because
the sound of the bamboo was especially sharp on its own, or because the
color of the flowers was particularly profound. Although the sound of
bamboo is wondrous, the sound occurs because of \[the bamboo's\]
conditions.^[266](#calibre_link-293){#calibre_link-760 .calibre13}^
Although the color of blossoms is beautiful, they do not bloom on their
own. They see the light when the springtime has come.

The conditions of studying the Way are also like this. Each of us
attains the Way because of the assistance from people in the sangha.
Although everyone is sharp-witted, we can \[only\] practice the Way
because of the power of the assembly. Therefore, we should now unify our
minds to study and investigate \[the Way\] together. A jewel becomes a
vessel by being polished. People become benevolent through cultivation.
What jewel glitters from the outset? Who can be sharp-witted from the
time they are beginners. We should polish and cultivate without fail. We
should not underestimate ourselves nor slacken our practice of the Way.

An ancient said, "Do not spend your days and nights in
vain."^[267](#calibre_link-294){#calibre_link-761 .calibre13}^ Now I ask
you: Does time stop passing if we hold it dear? Or does it continue to
pass even if we lament \[its passing\]? I also ask you: Does time pass
vainly? Or do people spend time in vain? This means that we should
practice the Way without spending time wastefully. Practice in this way
with unified minds.

It is not easy to uphold \[the Dharma\] by myself \[, so I ask the new
head monk to assist me\]. The Way practiced by the buddhas and ancestors
is always like this. There are many who attained the Way by following
the teaching of the Tathāgata, but there were some who \[instead\]
realized the Way from the instruction of
Ānanda.^[268](#calibre_link-295){#calibre_link-762 .calibre13}^ New head
monk! Do not deprecate yourself, saying that you are not a vessel \[of
the Dharma\]. Give a talk to your fellow practitioners on the story of
Dongshan's "three pounds of
hemp."^[269](#calibre_link-296){#calibre_link-763 .calibre13}^ So
saying, he descended from his seat. The drum was struck again, and the
head monk \[Ejō\] took the whisk. That was the first "taking of the
whisk" at Kōshō-ji. At that time, Ejō was thirty-nine years old.

## [5-5]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-133 .head2}

[One day]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

A layperson said \[to me\], "Who does not desire fine clothing? Who does
not indulge in rich flavors? However, people who aspire to live in the
Way enter the mountains, get water from the river, endure cold, and
endure hunger.^[270](#calibre_link-297){#calibre_link-764 .calibre13}^
It is not that ancient people did not suffer. Because they endured such
hardships and protected the Way, later people who hear of such examples
yearn for the Way and cherish their virtues."

Even in lay society, the wise have been like this. In the Buddha Way, we
should not fail to be the same. Not all ancient people had golden
bones;^[271](#calibre_link-298){#calibre_link-765 .calibre13}^ not all
people were superior vessels \[of the Dharma\] while \[Shakyamuni\] was
alive. When we consider many monks mentioned in the Vinaya Piṭaka of
either the Mahāyāna or Hīnayāna, some aroused unbelievably evil
minds.^[272](#calibre_link-299){#calibre_link-766 .calibre13}^ However,
later they attained the Way and became
arhats.^[273](#calibre_link-300){#calibre_link-767 .calibre13}^
Therefore, even though we are bad and inferior, we arouse the mind of
awakening because we know that if we arouse the mind of awakening and
practice, we will eventually attain the Way. Even in ancient times, all
people endured hardships, withstood the cold, and practiced the Way amid
their troubles. Students of today! Even if we suffer \[from physical
pain\] or mental anguish, we should force ourselves to practice the Way.

Students of the Way! You do not attain realization, because you hold on
to your old fixed views. Without knowing who taught you, you think that
"mind" is the functioning of your thoughts, knowledge, and views. You do
not believe me if I say that \[the mind\] is grasses and
trees.^[274](#calibre_link-301){#calibre_link-768 .calibre13}^ You think
that the Buddha must have various physical characteristics and a radiant
halo. If I say that \[the Buddha\] is broken tiles and pebbles, your
ears are astonished.^[275](#calibre_link-302){#calibre_link-769
.calibre13}^ Such views were not transmitted from your father or taught
by your mother. You have believed them without reason, simply being
influenced for a long time by the people who have said \[such things\].
Therefore, because \[what I have said\] is a definite saying of the
buddhas and ancestors, you should reform your mind; when it is said that
"mind" is grasses and trees, you should understand that grasses and
trees are "mind," and if you are told that "Buddha" is tiles and
pebbles, you should believe that tiles and pebbles are "Buddha." Thus,
if you continue to transform your original attachment \[to your old
views\], you will be able to truly attain the
Way.^[276](#calibre_link-303){#calibre_link-770 .calibre13}^

An ancient said, "Though the sun and the moon shine brightly, floating
clouds cover them over. Though clusters of orchids are about to bloom,
autumn winds blow, causing them to wither." This saying is found in the
[Essentials of Government of the Zhenguan]{.italice}
[Period]{.italice},^[277](#calibre_link-304){#calibre_link-771
.calibre13}^ comparing a wise king with his evil ministers. Now I would
say, even if floating clouds covered \[the sun and the moon\], they will
not remain for a long time. Even if autumn winds wither the flowers,
they will bloom again. Even if the ministers are evil, if the king is
wise, he will not be deceived for long. Practicing the Buddha Way should
be the same. No matter what evil we might commit for a while, if we
remain steadfast and maintain \[our practice\] for a long time, the
floating clouds will disappear and the autumn winds will cease.

## [5-7]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-137 .head2}

[One day]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Students! When you have the mind of a
beginner,^[278](#calibre_link-305){#calibre_link-772 .calibre13}^
whether you have aroused the mind of awakening or not, you should
thoroughly read and study the sacred scriptures: sutras, commentaries,
and so on.

I first aroused the mind of awakening to some degree because of
\[seeing\] impermanence.^[279](#calibre_link-306){#calibre_link-773
.calibre13}^ I widely visited various districts and finally left \[the
monastery on\] Mt. Hiei and practiced the Way, staying at Kennin-ji.
During that time, I did not meet a true teacher and did not have good
\[spiritual\] friends, and therefore I aroused mistaken thoughts within
delusions. Even my instructors taught me that, first of all, I should
become an eminent person who could be the equal of our predecessors in
study, become known in the nation, and be an honorable person in the
world. Because of such instructions, when I studied the Dharma
teachings, I desired to become equal to the ancient wise people in this
country, or I intended to become the same as those who received the
title of great master,^[280](#calibre_link-307){#calibre_link-774
.calibre13}^ and so on. When I read the [Biographies of]{.italice}
[Eminent Monks]{.italice}, the [Continued Biographies of Eminent
Monks]{.italice},^[281](#calibre_link-308){#calibre_link-775
.calibre13}^ and so on to study how the eminent monks and practitioners
of the Buddhadharma lived in the great country \[of China\], I found
that those people were not as my teachers taught. I began to understand
that these ambitions I had aroused were thoughts despised and hated in
all of the sutras, commentaries, and biographies. Then, considering the
true principle, I gradually realized that instead of being thought of as
a good person by inferior people in this age, if I think of fame I
should instead humbly compare myself with ancient wise people or good
people in later generations. If I wish to be equal \[to someone\],
instead of \[comparing myself with the inferior\] people in this
country, I should humbly compare myself with the predecessors and great
monks in China and India. I should aspire to become equal to them. Also,
I should humbly compare myself with various heavenly beings, unseen
beings, all buddhas and bodhisattvas, and so on and intend to become
equal to them. Once I had understood this truth, I began to think that

this country were like dirt or broken tiles. I completely reformed my
body and mind from what they had been up to that point.

[]{#calibre_link-990 .calibre2}

When we examine the Buddha's activities during his lifetime, \[we see\]
he abandoned his claim to the throne and entered the mountain forests. I
have read that even after he had completed the Way, he begged for food
for \[the rest of\] his lifetime. In the Vinaya, it is said, "Knowing
that home is not home, abandon home and leave
home."^[282](#calibre_link-309){#calibre_link-776 .calibre13}^ An
ancient said, "Do not be arrogant and consider yourself equal to
superior, wise people. Do not deprecate yourself and think you are equal
to inferior people."^[283](#calibre_link-310){#calibre_link-777
.calibre13}^ This means that both are a kind of arrogance. Though you
may be in a high position, do not forget that you may fall down. Though
you may be safe now, remember that you may have to face danger. Though
you may be alive today, do not think that you will be alive tomorrow.
The danger of death is right at your feet.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

Foolish people think and speak of senseless things. There is an old nun
working for this temple. She seems to be ashamed of her current humble
situation, and she tends to talk to others about how she used to be a
lady of the upper class. Even if people here believe she used to be so,
there is not any merit in it. I think it is quite useless.

[]{#calibre_link-1145 .calibre2}

It seems that most people tend to have this sort of sentiment. We can
see that such people lack the mind of awakening. When we reform such a
frame of mind, we will become a bit more like people \[of the Way\].

Also, there is a certain lay
monk^[284](#calibre_link-311){#calibre_link-778 .calibre13}^ who
completely lacks the mind of awakening. Because he is a close friend, he
is difficult for me to avoid. I would like to tell him to pray to
buddhas and gods to allow him to arouse the mind of
awakening.^[285](#calibre_link-312){#calibre_link-779 .calibre13}^ He
would certainly get angry, and he could fall out with me \[if I did
so\]. And yet, unless he arouses the mind of awakening, it is pointless
for both of us to be close friends.

## [5-8]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-139 .head2}

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

There is a saying, "Speak after reflecting three times." This means that
when we want to say something or do something, we should reflect three
times before we say or do it. The ancient Confucians often said that
they should consider everything three times, and if they thought it to
be good each time, they should say or do it. When the wise people of
China advise us to reflect on things three times, they meant many times.
We should ponder before speaking and consider before acting, and if it
is definitely good each time we think about it, we should say or do it.

We patch-robed monks should also be the same. Because, even if we do not
realize it, there might be something wrong with what we think and what
we say; we first of all need to reflect on whether or not it is in
accordance with the Buddha Way and consider whether it is beneficial to
both ourselves and others. After that, if it is good, we should do it or
say it. Practitioners! If you keep this attitude, you will never go
against the Buddha's will during your lifetime.

[]{#calibre_link-1036 .calibre2}

Years ago, when I first entered
Kennin-ji,^[286](#calibre_link-313){#calibre_link-780 .calibre13}^ all
the monks in the assembly guarded their three actions \[of body, speech,
and thought\] according to their capabilities, and each of them resolved
not to say or do anything that was not beneficial to the Buddha Way and
for other people. After the superintendent of
monks^[287](#calibre_link-314){#calibre_link-781 .calibre13}^ passed
away, the monks maintained the same attitude while his influence
remained. These days, there is no one who maintains such an attitude.
Today's students should understand this. If something is definitely
meaningful for ourselves and others as well as for the Buddha Way, we
must forget our own \[ego-centered\] self and say or do it. We should
not say or do anything meaningless. When elders or seniors are saying or
doing something, younger monks should not interrupt them. This is a
regulation set down by the Buddha. Be careful and practice this
regulation well.

Even laypeople may have the determination to forget themselves and think
of the Way.

In ancient times, there was a person whose name was Lin Xiangru of the
State of Zhao.^[288](#calibre_link-315){#calibre_link-782 .calibre13}^
Although he was from a lower class family, because of his wisdom he was
taken into service by the king of Zhao to administer the affairs of the
country. Once, as envoy of the king, he was dispatched to deliver a
piece of jade called the
[bi]{.italice}^[289](#calibre_link-316){#calibre_link-783 .calibre13}^
of Zhao to the country of Qin. Because the king of Qin had said he would
exchange fifteen cities for the [bi]{.italice}, Xiangru was sent to
carry it. At that time, the rest of the ministers conspired against him
saying, "If such a precious treasure is entrusted to a man of low birth
like Xiangru, it will look like there is no one capable in this country
\[to whom it could be entrusted\]. It will be shameful for the rest of
the ministers. We will be looked down upon by people of later
generations. We should kill him while he is on his way and take the
jade." At the time, someone informed Xiangru of this and advised him to
decline the mission in order to save his life. Xiangru said, "I dare not
decline. It would be my pleasure for it to be known to later generations
that Xiangru, envoy of the king, was killed by evil ministers while on
his way to Qin with the jade. Even though I might be killed, my name as
a wise man will remain." So saying, he left for Qin. When the other
ministers heard what he had said, they gave up their plot, saying, "It
is not possible for us to kill this person."

Finally, Xiangru met the king of Qin and gave him the [bi]{.italice}.
However, he realized that the king of Qin was not willing to give the
fifteen cities for it. Xiangru thought up a plan and said, "There is a
flaw in this jade. I will show it to you." So saying, he took the jade
back, and continued, "From your demeanor, Your Majesty, you seem to deny
us the fifteen cities. If that is the case, I will break this jade with
my head, hitting it against the bronze pillar!" Glowering at the king
with angry eyes, he moved toward the bronze pillar as if he were really
going to break the jade. The king of Qin said, "Do not break the
[bi]{.italice}. I will hand over the fifteen cities. Keep the
[bi]{.italice} while I make the arrangements." Afterward, Xiangru had
one of his men secretly take the jade back to his country.

Later, the kings of Zhao and Qin met at a place named Mianchi for a
party. The king of Zhao was a skillful lute player. The king of Qin
asked him to play. The king of Zhao played the lute without consulting
Xiangru. Xiangru then became angry because his king had obeyed an order
of the king of Qin. He said, "I will go and make the king of Qin play
the flute." He approached the king of Qin and said, "Your Majesty, you
are a skillful player of the flute. The king of Zhao would appreciate
listening to you very much. Your Majesty, please play." The king of Qin
refused. Xiangru said, "If you decline, I will kill you." A general of
Qin reached for his sword and rushed toward Xiangru. Xiangru glared
furiously at the general, who became frightened and retreated without
drawing his sword. Then the king of Qin finally played the flute.

Later, Xiangru became the prime minister and administered the affairs of
the country. One time, another minister, envious of Xiangru's higher
status, tried to kill him. At that time, Xiangru fled and hid himself
here and there. He appeared to be afraid of the minister; even when he
was supposed to go to the court, he did not. One of Xiangru's retainers
said, "It is easy to kill that minister. Why do you hide in fear?"
Xiangru said, "I am not afraid of him. With my eyes I defeated the
general of Qin. I also took back the jade from the king himself.
Needless to say, it would be easy to kill the minister. However, the
raising of an army and the gathering of troops should be for defending
our country against our enemies. As its ministers, we are now in charge
of protecting the country. If the two of us quarrel and fight with each
other, one of us will die. One half will then be lost. If that happens,
neighboring countries will take delight and attack us. Therefore, I hope
the two of us together remain unharmed in order to protect our country.
This is why I do not fight with him." Upon hearing of this, the
\[jealous\] minister became ashamed of himself and visited Xiangru to
express his regret. The two of them then cooperated on the task of
governing the country.

Xiangru forgot himself and carried out the Way like this. Now in
maintaining the Buddha Way, we should keep the same attitude as Xiangru.
There is a saying, "We may die for the Way; do not live without
it."^[290](#calibre_link-317){#calibre_link-784 .calibre13}^

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

It is difficult to determine what is good or bad. In the mundane world,
people say that it is good to wear garments made of fine cloth with
golden embroidery and bad to wear robes made of coarse cloth and
abandoned rags. In the Buddhadharma, the latter is good and pure, while
luxurious garments embroidered with gold and silver are considered bad
and defiled. In this way, the same is true for everything.

In my case, too, because I sometimes compose poetry, arranging rhyme and
tone, or effortlessly write prose, some laypeople \[praise me\], saying
it is extraordinary. And yet, there are others who criticize me for
knowing such things despite being a monk who has left home and is
studying the Way. What shall we take as good and abandon as bad?

It is said in a scripture, "That which is praised and pure is good; that
which is despised and is impure is evil." It is also said, "Things that
bring about suffering are called evil; things that invite joy are called
good."

In this way, we should carefully figure out in detail what is really
good, take it up, and practice it, and \[likewise\] see what is really
evil and discard it. Because a sangha is born from the realm of purity,
things that do not arouse human desires are considered good and pure.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

Many people of worldly society say, "Although I have the aspiration to
study the Way, the world is in the age of the last
Dharma.^[291](#calibre_link-318){#calibre_link-785 .calibre13}^ People's
quality has been declining, and I have only inferior capabilities. I
cannot bear to practice in accordance with the Dharma. I would like to
follow an easier path that is suitable to me, to merely make a
connection \[with the Buddha\], and hope to attain realization in a
future lifetime."

Now, I say that this utterance is totally wrong. In the Buddhadharma,
distinguishing the three periods of time---the ages of the true Dharma,
the semblance Dharma, and the last Dharma---is only a temporary
expedient. The genuine teaching of the Way is not like this. When we
practice, all of us should be able to attain \[the Way\]. Monks while
\[Shakyamuni\] was alive were not necessarily superior. There were some
monks who had incredibly despicable minds and who were inferior in
capacity. The Buddha set forth various kinds of precepts for the sake of
bad people and inferior
people.^[292](#calibre_link-319){#calibre_link-786 .calibre13}^ Each and
every human being has the possibility \[to clarify\] the Dharma. Do not
think that you are not a vessel \[of the Buddhadharma\]. When we
practice in accordance \[with the Dharma\], all of us should be able to
attain \[the Way\]. Because we already have a mind, we can distinguish
between good and bad. Because we have hands and feet, we do not lack
anything for doing
[gasshō]{.italice}^[293](#calibre_link-320){#calibre_link-787
.calibre13}^ and walking. In practicing the Buddhadharma, we should not
be concerned with the quality \[of people\]. All beings within the human
realm are all vessels. It is not possible \[to practice the
Buddhadharma\] if we are born as animals or something else. People who
study the Way should not wait for tomorrow. Only today and in this
moment, we must practice following the Buddha.

Even laypeople say that to maintain a household or to protect a castle,

set up individual rooms that create separations among people's body and

others, and practice the Way uniformly. This is how people have been

When Zen Master Fanghui^[295](#calibre_link-322){#calibre_link-789

is certainly a better place \[to do zazen\] than on the bare earth or
under a tree. If one section is broken and leaks, we should \[just\]
move to another spot and practice zazen where there are no leaks. If the
monks of the assembly could attain realization depending on the
condition of the temple buildings, \[then\] we ought to construct one
with gold and jewels. Realization has nothing to do with whether a
dwelling place is good or bad; it depends only upon diligence in zazen."

The next day, in a formal Dharma discourse, he said, "I have now become
the abbot of Yanqi; the roof and walls have many cracks and holes. The
entire floor is covered with precious jewels of snow. The monks hunch
their shoulders \[from the cold\] and sigh in the
darkness.^[296](#calibre_link-323){#calibre_link-790 .calibre13}^ It
reminds me of ancient sages sitting under the trees."

Not only the Buddha Way but the way of politics is also like this.
Emperor Taizong \[of the Tang dynasty\] did not build a new
palace.^[297](#calibre_link-324){#calibre_link-791 .calibre13}^
Longya^[298](#calibre_link-325){#calibre_link-792 .calibre13}^ said, "To
study the Way we should first of all learn poverty. After having learned
poverty and having become poor, we will be intimate with the Way." From
the ancient times of Shakyamuni Buddha up to the present day, I have
never seen or heard of a person who genuinely practiced the Way and
possessed great wealth.

## [5-11]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-145 .head2}

One day, a visiting monk said, "In recent times, the method of
renouncing the world has been to prepare food and other necessities for
each person beforehand so as not to have to worry about them later.
Although this is a trifling matter, it is a helpful foundation for the
practice of the Way. If these \[necessities\] are lacking, our practice
will be disturbed. According to what I have heard about \[how you
practice\] here, you make no such preparations and entrust everything to
fate. If this is really true, you will be troubled later on, will you
not? What do you think?"

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Everything \[I do\] has a precedent. I do not merely rely on my personal
preference. All the buddhas and ancestors in India and China lived in
this way. If we privately make a plan for our livelihood, there is no
time \[we can be free from the problems they cause\]. Also, there is no
definite way \[to make such preparations\]. This is the way all buddhas
and ancestors have been practicing, not \[just\] me. If we run out of
food and have nothing to eat, only then should we reevaluate and come up
with skillful means \[to fix the situation\]. We should not think about
such things in advance.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

I indirectly heard \[the following story\], though I am not sure whether
it is true. The late Middle Councilor Jimyōin, who was a lay monk, once
had a treasured sword stolen.^[299](#calibre_link-326){#calibre_link-793
.calibre13}^ The perpetrator was among his retainers. The other warriors
arrested the man and brought \[the sword\] to the councilor. The lay
monk said, "This is not my sword. There has been a mistake." He then
gave the sword back \[to the warrior\]. Although it was certainly his
sword, he gave it up because he thought of the shame of the warrior.
Although everyone knew \[the truth\], the situation ended without
trouble. As a result, the councilor's descendents flourished.

Even among the laity, those who are thoughtful \[of others\] are like
this. All the more should monks have the same thoughtfulness. Because it
is a matter of course that we monks have no wealth, we should consider
our wisdom and virtue as our treasures. Even when someone does something
contrary to the mind of awakening, we should not immediately express our
criticism and judge the person to be evil. We should search for skillful
means and speak in such a way that does not make the person angry. It is
said that "the Dharma does not last long if expressed violently." Even
if we should scold a person in accordance with the Dharma, if we use
rough language the Dharma will not remain long. Narrow-minded people
quickly become angry and think of their shame when they are criticized
with harsh words. Magnanimous people are not like this. Even when hit,
they would never think of revenge. In our country, there are many
narrow-minded people. We must be careful.

Compiled by the attendant Ejō

## [6-1]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-149 .head2}

[One]{.italice} [day]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\]
[instructed]{.italice}:

For the sake of the Buddhadharma, do not hold your bodily life dear.
Even when laypeople think of the
Way,^[300](#calibre_link-328){#calibre_link-794 .calibre13}^ they cast
away their lives and do not concern themselves with their families; they
remain true and maintain their fidelity. Such people are called
"faithful subjects" or "wise people."

In ancient times, Gaozu of
Han^[301](#calibre_link-329){#calibre_link-795 .calibre13}^ waged a war
against a neighboring country. At that time, the mother of one of his
ministers lived in that neighboring country. The imperial army suspected
the minister of treachery. Gaozu was also afraid that this minister,
thinking of his mother, might defect to the hostile country, which would
result in the war being lost.

Separately, his mother \[also\] thought that her son might have divided
loyalties on her account. She admonished him, saying, "Do not come to
our country because of me. Do not neglect your loyalty to the army
because of me. If I remain alive, you might be treacherous." So saying,
she threw herself upon a sword and died. Because her son was never of
two minds, it is said that he devoted himself to his duties in the war
with loyalty and firm determination.

Needless to say, patch-robed monks practicing the Buddha Way, when
completely without a divided heart, are truly in accordance with the
Buddha Way. Regarding the Buddha Way, there may be some who inherently
have compassion and wisdom from the outset. Even if we lack such
qualities, we will be able to attain \[the Way\] if we study \[it
sincerely\]. We need to simply cast away both body and mind,
dedicate^[302](#calibre_link-330){#calibre_link-796 .calibre13}^
ourselves to the ocean of the Three Treasures, entrust everything to the
teachings of the Buddhadharma, and refrain from holding on to our biased
personal views.

In the time of Gaozu of Han, a wise minister remarked, "Fixing the
disorder of the way of politics is like untying a knotted rope. Do not
be in a hurry. Loosen it only after the knot has been examined closely."
The Buddha Way is the same. We should practice it \[only\] after having
fully understood the principles of the Way. Those who carefully
understand the Dharma gates will have the mind of awakening without
fail.^[303](#calibre_link-331){#calibre_link-797 .calibre13}^ No matter
how intelligent or sharp we may be, if we lack the mind of awakening, if
we do not detach ourselves from our \[ego-centered\] self, and if we are
unable to abandon fame and profit, we will neither be able to become a
person of the Way nor be able to understand true reality.

## [6-2]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-151 .head2}

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Students of the Way! We should not study the Buddhadharma for the sake
of our own \[ego-centered\] self. We should study the Buddhadharma
simply for the sake of the Buddhadharma. The genuine way to do so is to
completely cast away body and mind, leaving nothing \[behind\] and
dedicating \[ourselves\] to the great ocean of the Buddhadharma. After
that, without being concerned about the right and wrong of each thing,
without clinging to our own views, even if it is difficult to endure, we
should allow ourselves to be used by the Buddhadharma when doing
things.^[304](#calibre_link-332){#calibre_link-798 .calibre13}^ Even if
we want to do something, we should give it up if it is not in accordance
with the principles of the Buddhadharma. We should never ever expect to
obtain good results in exchange for our efforts in practicing the Buddha
Way. Once we are dedicated to the Buddha Way, we should never look back
at ourselves. We should just continue practicing in accordance with the
regulations of the Buddhadharma without considering twisted personal
views. The examples of past practitioners have all been like this. When
we no longer seek anything on the basis of our \[ego-centered\] mind,
this itself is great peace and
joy.^[305](#calibre_link-333){#calibre_link-799 .calibre13}^

Those who have never kept company with others in the world and have
grown up only within their own families behave as they wish and put
priority on fulfilling their own hearts' desires. They never think of
how others see them and do not care how others feel. Without fail, such
people are bad. The points to watch in practicing the
Way^[306](#calibre_link-334){#calibre_link-800 .calibre13}^ are also
like this. We should keep company with others \[in the sangha\] and
follow our teacher without setting up personal views. If we continue
reforming our minds \[in this way\], we will easily become people of the
Way.

In studying the Way, we should first of all study poverty. We should
abandon profit, not ingratiate ourselves \[to those with power\] at all,
and cast everything away. We will then become good monks without fail.
In great Song China, those who were known as eminent monks all lived in
poverty for the sake of the Way. Their robes were tattered, and they
were short of other provisions.

A while ago, there was a senior monk named Daoru who was appointed as
the secretary^[307](#calibre_link-335){#calibre_link-801 .calibre13}^ of
Tiantong monastery. Although he was the son of a minister of the
government, because he had completely left his family and relatives and
never coveted worldly profit, his robes were so tattered that he was too
terrible to look at. And yet his virtue in the Way was known among
people, and he became the secretary of a great monastery. I asked this
man, "Master, you are the son of a high government official and the
grandson of a wealthy man. Why are your belongings so shabby? Why do you
live in such poverty?" He answered, "Because I have become a monk."

[One day]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

A layman said, "Wealth can damage one's life. This is \[true\] in the
past and in the present as well." This refers to a story in ancient
times about a layman who married a beautiful woman. A powerful man told
the layman to give the woman to him. The husband was unwilling to do so.
In the end, an army surrounded \[the layman's house\]. When his house
was about to be taken away, the husband said \[to his wife\], "I will
give up my life for you." The woman said, "\[No,\] I will give up my
life for you," and so saying, she jumped from a lofty building, killing
herself. Later, the husband---who had failed to be killed, and escaped
with his life---told this
story.^[308](#calibre_link-336){#calibre_link-802 .calibre13}^

Long ago, a wise man governed a province as a government official. He
had a son. When the son visited his father, he bowed and said farewell,
and the father gave him a bolt of fine silk. The son said, "You are a
person of high integrity. Where did you get this silk?" The father said,
"This is left over from my official pay." The son returned \[to the
capital\] and met with the emperor \[to whom he related what his father
had done\]. The emperor admired the father's wisdom. The son said, "My
father hid his reputation. I reveal his reputation. My father's wisdom
is superior to mine."^[309](#calibre_link-337){#calibre_link-803
.calibre13}^

This story teaches us that even though the bolt of silk was trivial, the
wise man did not take it for his private use. It also tells us that this
truly wise man concealed his reputation for wisdom. He said he would use
it \[only\] because the silk was a part of his own official pay. Even a
layman was like this. A patch-robed monk studying the Way should not
seek any personal \[benefit\]. Moreover, if we care for the true Way, we
should hide our reputation as a person of the Way.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

There was once a mountain
immortal.^[310](#calibre_link-338){#calibre_link-804 .calibre13}^
Someone asked him, "How does one become an immortal?" The immortal said,
"If you want to become an immortal, you should be fond of the
Way."^[311](#calibre_link-339){#calibre_link-805 .calibre13}^ Therefore,
students, if you wish to become buddha-ancestors, you should be fond of
the Way of the ancestors.

This story tells us that the mind of Confucianism is like this. Using
skillful sayings, they prevent wrongdoing and encourage good actions.
Patch-robed monks should also have this kind of skillfulness when
teaching others.

## [6-5]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-158 .head2}

One day, a monk asked, "In the long run, what is the difference between
a wise person without the mind of awakening and an unwise person with
the mind of awakening?"

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

In many cases, \[those with\] the mind of awakening \[but\] without
wisdom will eventually regress. People with wisdom, though lacking the
mind of awakening, will eventually arouse the aspiration for the Way. In
the present day there are many actual examples of this. Therefore,
without discussing whether we have aroused the mind of awakening or not,
we should, first of all, make diligent effort in studying the Way.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

In both Buddhist and non-Buddhist texts, \[we find\] people who were so
poor that they did not have a fixed abode: some wandered floating on the
water of the Canglang River,^[316](#calibre_link-344){#calibre_link-810
.calibre13}^ some hid themselves on Shouyang
Mountain,^[317](#calibre_link-345){#calibre_link-811 .calibre13}^ some
sat upright on the bare ground under a tree, and some built their
hermitages in graveyards or in the deep mountains. On the other hand,
some were wealthy and prominent, who built palaces coated with vermilion
lacquer and adorned with gold and jewels. We find both kinds of people
in various texts, but those who were poor and without possessions are
praised as paragons for later generations. When admonishing deeds \[that
create bad\] karma in the future, \[these texts\] criticized those who
were wealthy as being people of extravagance and arrogance.

Students! We should not take delight when receiving offerings from
people. Still, we should not reject them either. The late superintendent
of monks^[318](#calibre_link-346){#calibre_link-812 .calibre13}^ said,
"It goes against the precepts to rejoice upon receiving offerings. But
if we do not rejoice, we go against the good hearts of donors." The
ancient practice regarding this point is \[understanding\] that the
offerings are not made for our personal benefit but offered to the Three
Treasures. Therefore, in reply \[to the donors\], we should say, "This
offering will certainly be accepted by the Three Treasures. I humbly
transmit \[it on your behalf\]."

Later Yunfeng became an eminent master, and I, too, am now an abbot. At
the time I thought that even arguing about the Dharma teachings was
ultimately useless, not to mention fighting, which was definitely
mistaken. Because I thought it was useless to fight, I kept silent."

Today's students and \[lay\] disciples alike should consider this
preceding example. If we aspire to make diligent efforts in studying the
Way, we must cherish the time we have to study. When do we have spare
time to quarrel with others? Ultimately speaking, \[arguing\] brings no
benefit either to us or to others. Needless to say, we should not engage
in any futile disputes over mundane affairs. The power of a virtuous
person is superior to \[that of\] an ox. However, the person does not
compete with an ox. Even if we think we understand the Dharma teachings
and that we are superior to others, we should not argue, criticize, and
defeat them. If there is a sincere student who asks us about the Dharma,
we should not withhold \[our knowledge\]. We should explain and share.
However, even in such cases, only after we have been asked three times
should we answer one time.^[321](#calibre_link-349){#calibre_link-815
.calibre13}^ We should neither speak too much nor engage in idle talk. I
myself had this fault. Because I thought \[Zhenjing's\] admonishment
applied to me, I have subsequently never quarreled about Dharma
teachings with others.

cherish every moment \[we have\]. Our dew-like life disappears easily;
time passes swiftly. For the brief time that we exist, we should not
care for other affairs; we should devote ourselves to just studying the
Way.

[]{#calibre_link-1116 .calibre2}

These days, some people say that they cannot abandon their debts of
gratitude to their parents; some say they cannot disregard the orders of
their lords; some say they cannot part from the affection of their wives
and children; some say when they consider their families' and relatives'
survival, they cannot \[pursue\] their own wishes; some say worldly
people would slander them; some say they are poor and cannot afford
monks' supplies; and some say because they are not vessels \[of the
Dharma\], they are not capable of enduring the practice of the Way.
Because they consider matters with worldly sentiments such as these,
they cannot leave their lords, fathers, and mothers, or abandon their
wives, children, or relatives. They go on following worldly sentiments
and clinging to their desires for wealth and sexual greed. Consequently,
they spend their whole lifetimes in vain and cannot help feeling regret
when their lives are exhausted.

We should sit calmly, ponder reality, and determine the path we will
finally take after departing \[from this life in preparation for the
next life\]. Neither our lords nor our fathers or mothers are able to
give us realization. Nor can our wives or children save us from
suffering. Nor can our wealth save us when we die. Worldly people can
never help us \[with such matters\]. If we avoid practicing on the
grounds that we are not vessels \[of the Dharma\], in which eon will we
be able to attain the Way? We should simply cast everything aside and
wholeheartedly devote ourselves to the practice of the Way. Do not think
that there is any later time \[to practice\].

## [6-10]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-167 .head2}

[One day]{.italice}, \[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

In studying the Way, we should by all means depart from our
\[ego-centered\] self. Even if we are able to study a thousand
scriptures or ten thousand commentaries, if we do not free ourselves
from self-attachment, we will eventually fall into the pit of demons. An
ancient said, "If we lack the body and mind of the Buddhadharma, how is
it possible to become a buddha-ancestor?" To depart from ego-attachment
means to cast aside body and mind and never study the Buddhadharma for
our own benefit. We should simply study \[the Way\] for the sake of the
Way. Having cast our body and mind into the Buddhadharma, no matter how
painful it might be or even if we might be distressed, we should
continue to practice following the Buddhadharma. We might think that if
we beg for food, people will think ill of us. As long as we think in
this way, we will never be able to enter the Buddhadharma. We should
forget all views based on worldly sentiments and just practice the Way,
entrusting ourselves to its principles. Reflecting on our capability and
thinking that we are not able to practice in accordance with the
Buddhadharma is also due to our ego-attachment. Being concerned with the
public gaze and worrying about opinions based on human sentiments is the
root of ego-attachment. We should simply study the Buddhadharma. Do not
follow worldly sentiments.

As I investigate his frame of mind, it sounds as if he still values
brocade. Holy people are not like this. They see gold or jewels and
tiles or pebbles as equal. They are not attached \[to either\]. This is
the reason why the Tathāgata Shakyamuni accepted and ate the milk
porridge offered by the milkmaid, and he also ate grain used to feed
horses.^[325](#calibre_link-353){#calibre_link-819 .calibre13}^ He
accepted both equally. In the Dharma, there is no valuable or worthless.
\[However,\] in human affection there is shallowness or depth.

In the present age, there are some people who value gold and jewels and
yet do not accept them when people offer them, but they consider trees
and stones valueless yet love such things. We should consider that we
get gold and jewels from the soil, while trees and stones are also from
the great earth. For what reason should we consider one thing valuable
and not accept it yet consider another thing valueless and love it? When
I examine such people's frame of mind, it seems that they worry about
attachment if they obtain something valuable. Even if they acquire
something valueless yet love it, they will have the same fault. This is
what students should keep in mind.

## [6-13]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-173 .head2}

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

When my late master Preceptor
Myōzen^[326](#calibre_link-354){#calibre_link-820 .calibre13}^ was about
to go to Song China, his original master, Ācārya
Myōyu^[327](#calibre_link-355){#calibre_link-821 .calibre13}^ on Mt.
Hiei, became seriously ill and was close to death. At the time, the
master \[Myōyu\] said, "I am descending into old age and sickness; my
death must be near at hand. You alone \[must\] take care of me in my
aging and sickness, and see me off when I depart on the dark
road.^[328](#calibre_link-356){#calibre_link-822 .calibre13}^ For now,
put off going to China for a while, and after my death carry out your
true intention."

At that time, my late master \[Myōzen\] called his disciples and fellow
practitioners together to discuss this matter. He said, "Since I left my
parents' home in my childhood, I have been brought up under this
master's protection and educated by him until reaching my present
maturity. In worldly terms, I have a most heavy debt of gratitude. Also,
I have studied the Dharma gates that are beyond the worldly realm, such
as the verbal teachings of Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna, and the provisional as
well as the genuine teachings. I have come to understand the principle
of causes and results, and learned right from wrong. I have surpassed my
fellow students and gained honor. Now I understand the truth of the
Buddhadharma and aspire to go to China to seek the Dharma. This has all
been enabled solely by my master's kind nurturing. However, this year he
has become seriously ill due to old age, and he is lying on his
deathbed. We do not know how much longer he can live. \[If I leave now\]
I cannot expect to meet him again. Therefore, he strongly urges me to
postpone \[my plan\]. It is difficult to disobey my master's request.
Now I am about to go to China to seek the Dharma without holding my life
dear. This derives from great bodhisattva compassion for the sake of
benefiting living beings. Is there any reason to disobey \[my master\]
and go to the land of Song \[China\]? Each of you, please tell me what
you think."

At the time, each and every one of them said, "Give up journeying to
China this year. His aging and sickness are already critical, and he
will surely die. Giving up \[your plan\] this year and going to China
next year would be the most appropriate \[course of action\]. You would
neither go against your master's request nor disregard your great debt
of gratitude to him. There is nothing wrong with postponing your trip to
China for one or half a year. It would not go against the true intention
of the master-disciple \[relationship\], and still you would be able to
realize your true intention to go to China."

At that time, as the least senior monk, I said, "If you think that your
realization of the Buddhadharma is what it should be, you should put off
\[your trip to China\]." My late master said, "That is so. I think that
the practice of the Buddhadharma should be like this. If I continuously
\[practice\] in this way, I think I will be released \[from

I said, "If you think so, you should stay." After all of us expressed
our opinions, my late master said, "All of you agree that I should stay.
My intention differs. Even if I put off my trip this time, one who is
certain to die will not prolong his life. Also, by my remaining here,
taking care of him in his sickness and looking after him, his pain and
suffering will not cease. Also, simply because I took care of him before
his death would not mean that he would definitely be able to depart from
life-and-death. There would be only short-lived happiness from following
his request. This would be entirely useless for gaining emancipation and
attaining the Way. To mistakenly hinder my aspiration to seek the Dharma
would be a cause and condition of unwholesome karma. On the other hand,
if I carry out my aspiration to go to China to seek the Dharma and gain
a bit of realization, even though it goes against one person's defiled
feelings, it will become a cause for attaining the Way for many people.
If this merit is greater, it will help to repay the debt of gratitude to
my master. Even if I die while crossing the ocean and fail to accomplish
my original intention, because I will have died with the aspiration of
seeking the Dharma \[, my vow will not cease in a future life\]. We
should remember the Tripiṭaka Master Xuanzang's
traces.^[330](#calibre_link-358){#calibre_link-824 .calibre13}^ Vainly
spending time, which is easily lost, for the sake of one person would
not be in accordance with the Buddha's will. Therefore, I have firmly
resolved to go to China now." Having said this, in the end he went to
China.

For my late master, the true mind of awakening is this kind of mental
attitude. This being the case, today's students should also not spend
their time in vain involved in useless things for the sake of their
parents or masters. We should not spend our time setting aside the
superior Buddha Way.

At that time, Ejō asked, "For the sake of truly seeking the Dharma, we
must eliminate the contaminants that exist caused by our obligations to
our parents or masters. It is just as you say. However, although we
completely renounce our obligations and affection for our parents and
others, when we aspire to bodhisattva practice, we should still put
aside personal benefit and put primary importance on benefiting others.
If so, if an aged person were seriously ill, and no one but I could
nurse them, if I only thought of my own practice without helping them,
it would seem to go against bodhisattva practice, would it not? Also, a
[mahāsattva]{.italice}^[331](#calibre_link-359){#calibre_link-825
.calibre13}^ should not avoid carrying out wholesome actions. Should we
not consider the Buddhadharma according to circumstances and the
particular situation? For these reasons, should we not go and help such
a person? What do you think?"^[332](#calibre_link-360){#calibre_link-826

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Whether acting for the benefit of others or practicing for ourselves,
the good practice of a [mahāsattva]{.italice} is to abandon what is
inferior and to take what is superior. To care for sick and aged parents
in poverty^[333](#calibre_link-361){#calibre_link-827 .calibre13}^ is
only a temporary pleasure arising from illusory love and deluded
sentiment in this brief life. If we go against \[our defiled
sentiments\] and study the Way of non-action, even though we may be
resented \[by others\], it will bring about a positive connection beyond
the mundane world. Consider this well! Consider this well!

People of the world say of themselves, "Although I listen to my master's
sayings, they do not satisfy my mind." I think such a statement is
mistaken. How are such thoughts possible? Do they have \[their own\]
understanding of the principles of the sacred teachings and so on and
consider everything that does not coincide with their opinions to be
wrong? If so, why do they consult their masters? Or do they say such
things because their views are rooted in habitual \[deluded\] sentiment?
If this is the case, these are delusory thoughts from the beginningless
beginning. An essential point we should keep in mind in our study of the
Way is that we should give up and reform our egotistical views. Even if
\[some teachings\] go against our own preferences, if those are our
master's sayings, or statements from the sacred scriptures, we must
follow them for the time being. This is the genuine mental attitude in
the study of the Way.

Early on, among my fellow practitioners there was one who visited
masters while clinging strongly to his own views. He \[refused to
accept\] whatever differed from his opinions, saying that it did not
make sense to him, and held on to only what accorded with his own views.
He spent his whole life in vain without understanding the Buddhadharma.
Observing \[his attitude,\] I realized that studying the Way should not
be like that. I followed my master's sayings and, to a degree, attained
the truth of the Way. Later, I found the following passage while reading
a scripture: "If you wish to study the Buddhadharma, do not continue to
hold on to the \[conditioned\] mind of the past, present, and
future."^[334](#calibre_link-362){#calibre_link-828 .calibre13}^ I
understood that we must gradually reform previous thoughts without
holding firmly to them. In a text it is said, "Good advice sounds harsh
to the ear."^[335](#calibre_link-363){#calibre_link-829 .calibre13}^
Words \[that are said\] faithfully on our behalf are offensive to our
ears. Even though it may be contrary \[to our preferences\], if we force
ourselves to follow this advice and carry it out, there will be benefits
in the end.

## [6-15]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-177 .head2}

[One day]{.italice}, [during a miscellaneous talk]{.italice},
\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [said]{.italice}:

Originally, the human mind is neither good nor evil. Good and evil arise
depending on conditions. For example, when people arouse the mind of
awakening and enter a mountain forest, they think that a dwelling in the
woods is good and the human world is bad. And when their aspiration has
waned and they leave the mountain forest, they think the mountain forest
is bad. This is because the human mind has no fixed characteristics; it
changes in this way or that, influenced by circumstances. Consequently,
if we encounter good conditions, the mind becomes good. If bad
conditions draw near, the mind becomes bad. Do not think that the mind
is fundamentally evil. We should simply follow good circumstances.

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [also said]{.italice}:

I think the human mind definitely changes depending upon the words of
others. The [Great
Treatise]{.italice}^[336](#calibre_link-364){#calibre_link-830
.calibre13}^ states, "For example, it is like a foolish person who has a
precious jewel in his hand. Someone sees him and says, 'You are so
vulgar, holding things in your own hands.' Hearing this, he thinks,
'This jewel is precious, yet my reputation is also important. I do not
want to be thought of as vulgar.' Worried about this and pulled around
by \[the idea of his\] reputation, he finally follows the person's
words. He decides to put down his jewel and later has his servant take
it. In the end, he loses the jewel."

The human mind works in this way. Even though we may think a certain
thing is undoubtedly good for us, sometimes we \[instead\] go along with
what other people say. Therefore, no matter how evil the mind seems to
be originally, when we follow a good master and listen continuously to
what good people say, the mind naturally becomes good. If we associate
with evil people, even though we may think they are bad, eventually we
will fall under such people's influence, and finally our mind truly
becomes evil.

Also, although we may have determined in our mind not to give a certain
thing to a certain person, if they strongly and repeatedly press us, we
may give it to them unwillingly even though we dislike them. What is
more, even if we decide to give the thing to a person \[whom we do
like\], we might not \[do so\] if we do not have a good opportunity.

Therefore, even if we have not yet aroused the mind of awakening, we
should become close with good people, meet with good conditions, and
listen to and look at the same things again and again. Do not think that
we do not need to listen anymore because we have already heard something
once. Even if we have aroused the mind of awakening once, when we hear
the same things over and over, \[our mind\] will become more polished,
and we will improve more and more. Moreover, even if we still lack the
mind of awakening and do not find it interesting the first and second
time, \[when we listen\] again and again repeatedly, it is like walking
through mist.^[337](#calibre_link-365){#calibre_link-831 .calibre13}^
Just as we become wet without noticing it, we will naturally feel
ashamed \[of our previous lack of understanding,\] and the true mind of
awakening will arise.

For this reason, even if we have understood the sacred scriptures, we
must read and listen to them again and again. We must listen to what our
master says over and over, even if we have heard it many times before.
The meaning will be increasingly profound. For the sake of the Way, we
should not get close to or be involved in matters that might obstruct
it. Even if it is difficult and dull, we should become close with good
friends and practice the Way \[with them\].

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

Zen Master Dahui once had a tumor on his
buttocks.^[338](#calibre_link-366){#calibre_link-832 .calibre13}^ A
doctor examined it and said, "This is serious." Dahui asked, "Is it
serious enough that I might die?" The doctor replied, "It is likely
fatal." Dahui said, "If I am going to die, I ought to do zazen even
more." He sat with strong determination, eventually the tumor broke
open, pus oozed out, and he recovered.

This ancient's mind was like this. When he became sick, he did zazen all
the more. We people today, being healthy, should not slacken in our
zazen.

I think that sicknesses change in accordance with our minds. In the
mundane world, when someone has the hiccups, if someone else tells a lie
that shocks them and captures their attention, the person will be taken
by surprise and try to say something and, in the process, forget about
the hiccups, and they will stop \[having the hiccups\].

On my journey to Song China I was suffering from diarrhea while on board
the ship, yet when a storm came and there was an uproar on board, I
forgot about the sickness, and it went away.

Considering this, I think that when we diligently study and practice the
Way and forget everything else, no illnesses will arise.

There is a proverb in the lay realm that says, "Unless you become deaf
and dumb, you cannot become the head of an \[extended\] family." This
means that if we do not hear criticism from others and do not speak of
the faults of others, we will be able to be successful in our work. A
person like this can be the great head of a family. Although this is a
proverb in the lay realm, we must apply it to our conduct as patch-robed
monks. Without being disturbed by slanderous remarks from others, and
without reacting to the resentment of others, how can we practice our
own Way? Thoroughly devoted^[339](#calibre_link-367){#calibre_link-833

It is said in the "Faith in Mind
Inscription,"^[342](#calibre_link-370){#calibre_link-836 .calibre13}^
"The ultimate Way is not difficult; it only dislikes picking and
choosing." When we cast away the mind of preference, we will immediately
be able to accept \[the Way\] just as it is. To cast away the mind that
picks and chooses is to separate from the \[ego-centered\] self. This is
to say that we must not study the Buddhadharma to accomplish the Buddha
Way for our own sake. We continue to practice the Buddhadharma only for
the sake of the Buddhadharma. Even if we were able to study a thousand
scriptures and ten thousand commentaries and do zazen hard enough to
destroy the floor beneath us, without this frame of mind it would not be
possible to study and attain the Way of the buddhas and ancestors. We
must simply cast body and mind into the midst of Buddhadharma. If we
follow \[our teachers\] without \[attachment to\] our former views, we
will immediately be in accordance with \[the Way\].

Students of the Way! When you see the fundamental
point,^[348](#calibre_link-376){#calibre_link-842 .calibre13}^ you must
draw your eyes close and make exhaustive efforts to examine it.

## [6-21]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-189 .head2}

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

An ancient said, "At the top of a hundred-foot pole, you must advance
one step further."^[349](#calibre_link-377){#calibre_link-843
.calibre13}^ This means that we should climb up to the top of a
hundred-foot pole and, further, release both our hands and our feet; in
other words, this is like casting aside body and mind. There are various
degrees in this regard.

Even though it seems that some people of the world today have renounced
the world and left their homes, if we examine their conduct, there are
also those who are not yet true home-leavers. Those who are called
home-leavers must first of all give up the \[ego-centered\] self as well
as fame and profit. Unless we become free from these, even if we
practice the Way as if extinguishing a fire enveloping our
heads,^[350](#calibre_link-378){#calibre_link-844 .calibre13}^ or
zealously cut off our hands or
legs,^[351](#calibre_link-379){#calibre_link-845 .calibre13}^ it would
only be a meaningless hardship that has nothing to do with renunciation.

Even in great Song China, there are those who have separated themselves
from \[familial\] affection from which it is hard to separate; have
abandoned worldly wealth, which is difficult to abandon; have joined
communities of practitioners; and have visited various monasteries. Some
of them, however, have been spending their lives in vain, because they
practice without clearly understanding this essential point \[about
abandoning affection and wealth\]. They neither realize the Way nor
clarify the mind. There are some people whose mental attitudes are as
follows.

Although in the beginning they arouse the mind of awakening, become
monks, and follow their teachers, instead of aspiring to become buddhas,
they only concern themselves with making it known to their patrons,
supporters, and relatives how respectable they are or how high the
status of their temple is. They try to make people revere them and make
offerings to them. Furthermore, they claim that other monks are all
misguided and immoral, that only they are good monks with the mind of
awakening. They try to persuade people to believe their words. People
like this are not even worth criticizing; they are like the five evil
monks who were
[icchantika]{.italice}^[352](#calibre_link-380){#calibre_link-846
.calibre13}^ during the time when \[the Buddha\] was in this world.
Their mental attitude will definitely make them fall into hell. There
are also laypeople who do not know these things and think that \[such
monks\] are possessors of the mind of awakening, respectable people, and
so forth.

[]{#calibre_link-1011 .calibre2}

There are some who are slightly better than these people. They do not
covet offerings from donors or patrons, have abandoned their affection
toward family and relatives, have joined the monastic community, and
practice the Way together with the assembly. However, though they feel
ashamed of being idle, because they are lazy by nature, they pretend to
be practicing when the abbot or the head monk is watching, yet when no
one sees them, they rest whenever possible, neglecting to do what they
are supposed to do. These people are better than similarly irresponsible
laypeople, but they still cannot cast away their \[ego-centered\] selves
or \[desires for\] fame and profit.

There are also those who are not concerned with what their teacher
thinks or whether the head monk or other fellow practitioners are
watching or not. They always think that practicing the Buddha Way is not
for the sake of others but only for their own sake; such people desire
to become buddhas with their own minds. They truly practice diligently.
Even though they genuinely seem to be people of the Way compared with
the aforementioned people, because they still think of themselves and
think they can improve themselves, they have still not become free from
their \[ego-centered\] selves. They also want to be admired by buddhas
and bodhisattvas; they desire to attain Buddhahood and awakening;
consequently, they still cannot cast away their minds \[aimed at\] fame
and profit.

Up to this point, none of these people have yet left the hundred-foot
pole; they remain clinging to it. Those who simply cast body and mind
into the Buddhadharma and continue to practice without the desire either
to realize the Way or attain the Dharma can be called "undefiled
practitioners." This is what is meant by the saying, "Not staying where
a buddha exists, and running quickly from where no-buddha
exists."^[353](#calibre_link-381){#calibre_link-847 .calibre13}^

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

When it comes to obtaining food and clothing, we must not make
arrangements in advance. Even regarding the place for begging for food,
if we think that when we run out of food and have nothing to cook, we
should beg for food at a particular place, or we should ask a particular
person for what we need, then this is the same as storing
food.^[354](#calibre_link-382){#calibre_link-848 .calibre13}^ This is
food \[gained by\] improper \[means\]. A patch-robed monk should be like
a cloud with no fixed abode, like flowing water with nothing to rely on.
Such a person is called a monk. Even if one possesses nothing but robes
and a bowl, if one relies on some patron or close relative, they are
both bound to each other \[by affection\] and the food becomes impure.
It is impossible to realize or understand the pure great Dharma of all
buddhas with a body and mind fed and maintained by impure food. Just as
cloth dyed with indigo becomes blue and cloth dyed with the Amur cork
tree becomes yellow, a body and mind dyed with food \[obtained through\]
wrong livelihood^[355](#calibre_link-383){#calibre_link-849 .calibre13}^
becomes a body of wrong livelihood. Desiring to attain the Buddhadharma
with such a body and mind is like pressing sand to get oil. In each
situation, we must simply handle everything in accordance with the Way.
All the things we plan in advance \[to make our lives secure\] go
against \[the Way\]. We must consider this very carefully.

[]{#calibre_link-992 .calibre2}

Each and every student must know that everyone has one fault. Arrogance
is the greatest fault. Both Buddhist and non-Buddhist texts admonish
against this.

In a non-Buddhist text, it is said, "Although there are some who are
poor but do not curry favor, there are none who are rich but not
arrogant."^[356](#calibre_link-384){#calibre_link-850 .calibre13}^ This
text admonishes us not to become arrogant even if we are wealthy. This
matter is an important one. We must consider it very carefully.

If we are of humble birth and desire not to be inferior to the next
person, or hope to surpass them, this is a typical example of arrogance.
This is easy to admonish. Even in the mundane world, relatives gather
around a person who is wealthy, fortunate, and powerful, and they allow
that person \[to do anything\]. In such a case, humble people around
such a person disparage themselves \[due to feeling inferior\]. How can
such a person with fortune and power avoid causing people around him to
deprecate themselves? Even if the person does not have an arrogant mind,
if he behaves naturally, the lowly people around him are pained. This is
an important consideration in every situation. To restrain oneself in
this kind of situation is to restrain arrogance. A person who enjoys his
wealth, relying on his karmic rewards while paying no attention to the
poor and lowly who envy him, is called an arrogant person.

An ancient said, "Do not pass in front of a poor man's house riding a
chariot." This therefore says that even if we are able to ride a
chariot, we must have scruples in front of poor people. Non-Buddhist
texts \[have admonitions\] like this. Buddhist scriptures also \[have
admonitions\] like this.

However, students and monks nowadays consider wisdom and \[knowledge
of\] the Dharma teachings to be their wealth. Do not be haughty with
these. To speak of the faults of people inferior to oneself or to
criticize one's senior or fellow practitioners' mistakes, these are
exceedingly arrogant.

An ancient said, "Even if you are defeated in front of a sage, do not
win in front of a fool." When someone misunderstands things we know
well, speaking of the other's faults is still our fault. When talking
about the Dharma writings, do not criticize the foolishness of the
predecessor \[of the person with whom you are talking\]. Also, when
ignorant people who have not yet aroused the mind of awakening become
envious or abase themselves, we must carefully consider this point.

While I was staying at Kennin-ji, many people asked me about the Dharma
teachings.^[357](#calibre_link-385){#calibre_link-851 .calibre13}^ Even
though there were faults and errors \[in their views\], I kept this
point deep in my heart and only talked about the virtue of the Dharma as
it is, instead of speaking of the faults of others. I avoided trouble in
this way. If we speak of the faults of the respected elders of fools who
are deeply attached to their own opinions, it will arouse their anger.
If people with wisdom and sincerity understand the true meaning of the
Dharma, even if we do not say \[anything regarding their faults\], they
will realize their own mistakes and the mistakes of their respected
elders and reform them. We must consider this thoroughly.

## [6-24]{.semibolditalice1} {#section-195 .head2}

\[[Dōgen]{.italice}\] [instructed]{.italice}:

The most essential matter in studying the Way is zazen. In great Song
China many people attained the Way, and all did so through the power of
zazen. If even an untalented, dull-witted person who cannot penetrate a
single sentence devotes himself to zazen practice, he can exceed an
intelligent person who has been studying for many years. Therefore,
students must just sit \[[shikantaza]{.italice}\] without being involved
in other things. The Way of the buddhas and ancestors is simply zazen.
Do not follow other things.

Ejō asked, "In learning both sitting and the reading of sayings, when I
read the recorded sayings or kōans, I feel I am only able to understand
one thing out of a hundred or a thousand. In zazen there is nothing like
that. Should we nonetheless still be fond of zazen?"

Even if you may seem to have some understanding when examining kōans or
their fundamental points,^[358](#calibre_link-386){#calibre_link-852
.calibre13}^ \[such studies\] keep you distant from the Way of the
buddhas and ancestors. To spend your time sitting upright with nothing
to gain and nothing to realize is the Way of the ancestors. Although the
ancients recommended both reading \[kōan\] stories and just sitting
\[[shikantaza]{.italice}\], they still principally promoted sitting.
Although there are some who have gained realization through the
fundamental points \[of kōans\], this is also due to the merit of
sitting. It is the cause and condition of the unfolding of realization.
True merit can only be from sitting.

## [D[ŌGEN AND]{.small} P[OETRY]{.small}]{.semiboldcapse} {#dōgen-and-poetry .head}

Eihei Dōgen is considered one of the great masters in the history of
Japanese Buddhism. He was a reformer of Buddhist monastic practice and
the founder of the first independent Sōtō Zen monastery in Japan based
on the zazen practice of [shikantaza]{.italice} ([只管打坐]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; "just sitting"). He was not only the leader of a Zen
community but also a wonderful writer. His collection of writings in
Japanese entitled [The True]{.italice} [Dharma]{.italice}[-Eye
Treasury]{.italice} ([正法眼藏]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}) is cherished by Buddhists, religious scholars,
philosophers, and lovers of literature around the world. He also wrote
extensively in Chinese, including [The Record of the Hōkyō]{.italice}
[Era]{.italice} ([宝慶記]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Hōkyō
k]{.italice}[i]{.italice}), [Points to Watch in]{.italice} [Practicing
the Way]{.italice} ([学道用心集]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Gakudō
yōjinshū]{.italice}), and the works that were later compiled into [Pure
Standards of Eihei-ji]{.italice} ([永平清規]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. [Eihei shingi]{.italice}). Finally, he was a poet, composing more
than four hundred Chinese poems included in [Dōgen]{.italice}['s
Extensive Record]{.italice} ([永平広録]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[Eihei kōroku]{.italice}), as well as some Japanese waka poems.
[Waka]{.italice} ([和歌]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) literally means
"Japanese poetry," as opposed to [kanshi]{.italice} ([漢詩]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), which are Chinese poems. The most popular form of waka,
called [tanka]{.italice} ([短歌]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), usually has
five lines totaling thirty-one syllables
(5-7-5-7-7).^[366](#calibre_link-395){#calibre_link-860 .calibre13}^
Part 2 is a translation of a Japanese collection of Dōgen's waka with my
commentary on each poem.

It is well known among Dōgen scholars and practitioners that in
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} [Zuimonki]{.italice} ([正法眼蔵隨聞記]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) Dōgen disparaged the value of literature:

::: block
Zen monks these days are fond of studying literature as a grounding to
compose verses or write Dharma words. This is wrong.
[]{#calibre_link-1165 .calibre2}Even if you cannot compose verses, just
write what you think in your mind. Even if your style is not
sophisticated, write down the Dharma gates. People without the mind of
awakening will not read it if your writing style is not well polished,
but even if the style is embellished and there are excellent phrases in
it, such people would only play with the words without grasping the
principle \[behind them\]. I have been fond of studying \[literature\]
since my childhood, and even now I have a tendency to contemplate the
beauty in the words of non-Buddhist texts. Sometimes I even refer to the
[Selections]{.italice} [of Refined Literature]{.italice} or other
classic texts. Still, I think it is meaningless, and it should cease
immediately.^[367](#calibre_link-396){#calibre_link-861 .calibre13}^

In my case, too, since I sometimes compose poetry, arranging rhyme and
tone, or effortlessly write prose, some laypeople praise me, saying this
is extraordinary. And yet, there are others who criticize me for knowing
such things despite being a monk who has left home and is studying the
Way. What shall we take as good and abandon as
bad?^[368](#calibre_link-397){#calibre_link-862 .calibre13}^
:::

In these talks, Dōgen is saying two things. He tells us that since
childhood, he thoroughly studied and enjoyed literature, both Chinese
and Japanese prose and poetry. He was very knowledgeable, and he wrote
his own poems even after he became a Buddhist monk. But he is also
saying that he believes such knowledge and writing skills are not only
valueless experiences but even obstacles for studying the Buddha Way.

Some think, based on these sayings, that Dōgen contradicted himself by
writing so many poems. But Dōgen was a complex person. Despite these
comments, he hosted a gathering of monks to compose poems on the
harvest-moon night each year, and many Chinese poems are included in
[Dōgen's Extensive Record]{.italice}.

In his poems, Dōgen expressed his understanding without much
consideration of sophisticated wording or rhetorical techniques.
[]{#calibre_link-1228 .calibre2}If he had wanted to, he presumably could
have written highly embellished poems, as people did at the emperor's
court from where he originally came, but the waka poems attributed to
Dōgen are simple and without much ornamentation. I think Dōgen's
comments in [Zuimonki]{.italice} resemble what the famous Sōtō monk-poet
Ryōkan ([良寛]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1758--1831 CE) said about his
own poetry:

Who says that my poems are poems?

My poems aren't poems at all.

When you understand

That my poems really aren't poems

Then we can talk poetry
together.^[369](#calibre_link-398){#calibre_link-863 .calibre13}^

Another poem by Ryōkan elaborates this point:

How pitiful, those virtuous fellows!

Moving into the recesses, they immerse

themselves in composing poetry

For Ancient Style, their models

are the poems of Han and Wei

For Recent Form,

the T'ang poets are their guide

With gaudy words their lines are formed

And further adorned by

novel and curious phrases

Yet if they fail to express

what's in their own minds

What's the use, no matter

how many poems they compose!^[370](#calibre_link-399){#calibre_link-864
.calibre13}^

Dōgen and Ryōkan do not say they should not write poems---but rather
their poems should not be evaluated by worldly standards such as
literary devices and flowery styles.

[]{#calibre_link-1129 .calibre2}

## [F[AMILY AS THE]{.small} S[OURCE OF]{.small} D[ŌGEN'S]{.small} L[ITERARY]{.small} S[ENSIBILITY]{.small}]{.semiboldcapse} {#family-as-the-source-of-dōgens-literary-sensibility .head}

Dōgen was born into the Minamoto ([源]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) family
descended from Emperor Murakami ([村上天皇]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
926--967 CE). His family was also called Koga ([久我]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) or Murakami Genji ([村上源氏]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}).^[371](#calibre_link-400){#calibre_link-865 .calibre13}^
His father was Minamoto no Michitomo ([源通具]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
1171--1227 CE) who held the position of major councilor
([大納言]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [dainagon]{.italice}) in the
emperor's court.^[372](#calibre_link-401){#calibre_link-866 .calibre13}^
We do not know much about Dōgen's mother, but according to the biography
of Dōgen in the [Record of Kenzei]{.italice} ([建撕記]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Kenzei]{.italice} [ki]{.italice}), it seems she was
a daughter of Fujiwara no Motofusa ([藤原基房]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
1144--1230 CE), the former chief advisor to the emperor
([関白]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [kanpaku]{.italice}).

Dōgen is said to have read a collection of Chinese poems when he was
four years old. He received the best education available, intended to
train an aristocrat to become a high-ranking court officer of the
imperial government. For such a position, one needed to be not only a
capable politician but also a scholar and poet. Dōgen's father was an
excellent waka poet and one of the editorial board members responsible
for creating the [New Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern]{.italice}
([新古今和歌集]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Shin kokin
wakashū]{.italice}). This is one of the eight anthologies of waka
created at the imperial court, and it is considered to be one of the
three most influential, together with [Man'yōshū]{.italice}
([万葉集]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}, literally "[Collection of Ten
Thousand]{.italice} [Leaves]{.italice}") and the [Collection of Poems
Ancient and Modern]{.italice} ([古今和歌集]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. [Kokin wakashū]{.italice}). Dōgen's grandfather Michichika
([通親]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1149--1202 CE) was also an eminent
politician and waka poet.

In fact, Dōgen's ancestry included numerous great waka poets, both men
and women. Many of their works are collected in the [New Collection of
Poems Ancient and Modern]{.italice}. Although, as he mentioned in
[Zuimonki]{.italice}, Dōgen was fond of studying the Chinese classics
and the poetry of both China and Japan as a child, it seems when he
renounced his aristocratic family and became a Buddhist monk at
thirteen, he gave up his interest in the rhetorical techniques he had
been taught.

[]{#calibre_link-1171 .calibre2}

Although he quit composing waka with the sophisticated literary devices
used, for example, in the [New Collection of Poems Ancient]{.italice}
[and Modern]{.italice}, Dōgen occasionally included his own waka in his
letters. When asked, he also composed and used them as aids in teaching
the Dharma. Because waka were considered a less important method of
expressing insight than Chinese poems, Dōgen probably had no intention
of creating a waka anthology. In Japanese Buddhist communities Chinese
was the primary language for formal writing, just as Latin was for
Western Christians. Following the custom of Chinese Zen monasteries,
when he gave formal Dharma hall discourses ([上堂]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [shàngtáng]{.italice}; Jp. [jōdō]{.italice}), Dōgen
usually included Chinese poems. There are more than four hundred Chinese
poems in [Dōgen's Extensive Record]{.italice}. Yet it is possible people
who received Dōgen's waka also kept them as personal treasures, and some
may have memorized them. Such poems were probably gathered later into a
collection.

## [C[OLLECTIONS OF]{.small} D[ŌGEN'S]{.small} W[AKA]{.small}]{.boldcapse} {#collections-of-dōgens-waka .head}

Part 2 includes my translations of Dōgen's waka included in the Japanese
text [Dōgen Zenji waka]{.italice} [sh]{.italice}[ū]{.italice}
([道元禅師和歌集]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), which is found in volume
seventeen of [Dōgen Zenji zenshū]{.italice} ([道元禅師全集]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), a complete collection of all of Dōgen's writings
published by Shunjusha ([春秋社]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) in 2010. I
have written a short commentary on each poem. In the Shunjusha text,
Bunji Takahashi ([高橋文二]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), a professor
emeritus at the Sōtō Zen--affiliated Komazawa University and scholar of
Japanese literature, rendered the waka into modern Japanese and added
notes on each, as well as a bibliographical essay. Although I did not
translate his notes, they were enormously helpful to me.

The Shunjusha text is based on the collection of Dōgen's waka included
in [Kenzei's Record of the]{.italice} [Life of Dōgen Zenji, Founder of
Eihei-ji]{.italice} ([永平開山道元禅師行状建撕記]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp[.]{.italice} [Eihei kaisan Dōgen Zenji gyōjō Kenzei
ki]{.italice}) written by Kenzei ([建撕]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
1415--1474 CE), the fourteenth abbot of Eihei-ji. This text is usually
known by its abbreviated title, the [Record]{.italice} [of
Kenzei]{.italice} ([建撕記]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Kenzei
ki]{.italice}). It is not clear exactly when this biography was written.

[]{#calibre_link-1207 .calibre2}

According to the great Dōgen scholar Dōshū Ōkubo
([大久保道舟]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1896--1994 CE), Kenzei was abbot
of Eihei-ji from 1468 to 1474. The [Record]{.italice} [of
Kenzei]{.italice} was probably written before 1472, when there was a big
fire at Eihei-ji.^[373](#calibre_link-402){#calibre_link-867
.calibre13}^ Beginning in the second half of the twentieth century,
several old, hand-copied versions of the [Record of Kenzei]{.italice}
came to light. Professor Kōdō Kawamura ([河村孝道]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) produced a side-by-side comparison of most of them in
[Shohon taikō: Eihei kaisan Dōgen zenji]{.italice} [gyōjō Kenzei
ki]{.italice} ([諸本対校：永平開山道元禅師行状建撕記]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) published by Daishūkan Shoten ([大修館書店]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) in 1975. The source text for Shunjusha's text is the
oldest hand-copied version, made by a monk named Zuichō
([瑞長]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) in 1589.

In the [Record of Kenzei]{.italice}, a collection of Dōgen's waka
follows the description of his death and funeral. In Zuichō's
manuscript, there are fifty-one waka included in this collection. In
addition, there are two more waka that are included within the
biographical portion of the text in the [Record of Kenzei]{.italice}
(numbers 52 and 53 in this book), for a total of fifty-three poems. In
the other versions of the [Record of Kenzei]{.italice}, the number of
poems is slightly different.

Around 1420, Kishun ([喜舜]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; n.d.), the eighth
abbot of Hōkyō-ji ([宝慶寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) and resident monk
of Tōun-ji ([洞雲寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), copied some of Dōgen's
waka and supposedly offered them to Kenkō ([建綱]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; 1413--1469 CE), the thirteenth abbot of
Eihei-ji.^[374](#calibre_link-403){#calibre_link-868 .calibre13}^ It is
not clear whether Kishun copied a manuscript that already contained a
collection of waka, or if he himself collected the poems from various
places.

After being asked by a patron of Eihei-ji to write a biography of Dōgen
Zenji, Kenkō delegated this project to his Dharma heir, Kenzei, asking
him to include the waka Kishun had given him. This is how a collection
of Dōgen Zenji's waka appeared in the [Record of Kenzei,]{.italice} in
which they were passed down for several centuries. We do not have
information regarding Dōgen's waka poems before Kishun's collection,
with one exception: Dōgen's fourth-generation descendent, Keizan Jōkin
([瑩山紹瑾]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1268--1325 CE), referred to one of
Dōgen's waka in the Dharma words ([法語]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[hōgo]{.italice}) he wrote to a patron, discussed in my commentary on
waka 45 in this book.

[]{#calibre_link-1198 .calibre2}

In 1754 the great monk-scholar Menzan Zuihō ([面山瑞方]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; 1683−1769 CE) revised, annotated, and published the aptly
named [Revised and Annotated Record of Kenzei]{.italice}
([訂補建撕記]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Teiho kenzei ki]{.italice})
as a woodblock-printed book, which added his own interpretations
regarding Dōgen's life. However, Menzan did not inlcude the collection
of Dōgen's waka. Instead, several years before in 1747, Menzan extracted
the waka from the [Record of Kenzei]{.italice} and published them as an
independent book titled [Verses on the Way from Sanshō Peak]{.italice}
([傘松道詠]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Sanshō dōei]{.italice}).
According to Menzan's [Revised and Annotated]{.italice} [Record of
Kenzei]{.italice}, Sanshō was the original mountain name of Daibutsu-ji
([大仏寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), the temple Dōgen founded that was
later renamed Eihei-ji.

Hand-copied manuscripts remained stored in the treasuries of old temples
while Menzan's woodblock-printed books of both the [Record of
Kenzei]{.italice} and [Verses on the]{.italice} [Way from Sanshō
Peak]{.italice} circulated widely within the Sōtō Zen community. They
came to be considered the only authentic sources of Dōgen's biography
and his collection of waka. Until the middle of the twentieth century,
all traditional commentaries on Dōgen's waka were based on Menzan's
[Verses on]{.italice} [the Way from Sanshō Peak]{.italice} rather than
earlier manuscripts.

After World War II, Sōtō Zen scholars tried to find the older,
hand-copied versions of Dōgen's writings, his waka, and the [Record of
Kenzei]{.italice}. They discovered various versions of the [Record of
Kenzei]{.italice}, each of which included a waka collection, as
mentioned previously. These collections were quite different from
Menzan's [Verses on the Way from Sanshō Peak]{.italice}. Menzan had
changed the titles and order of the poems, added some poems he found
elsewhere, and even changed the wording of some waka. Because Menzan was
a great scholar, he likely thought that whatever did not make sense to
him was a mistake made in the process of hand copying. He likely wanted
to create the most reliable and authoritative collection of Dōgen's waka
according to the knowledge he had at the time. Today's scholars no
longer use the title [Verses on the Way from Sanshō Peak]{.italice} to
refer to Dōgen's collection of waka but instead simply call it the
[Collection of Dōgen Zenji's Waka]{.italice}
([道元禅師和歌集]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Dōgen Zenji waka
shū]{.italice})

[]{#calibre_link-1181 .calibre2}

Nanboku Oba ([大場南北]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) was the first person
who criticized Menzan's [Verses on the Way]{.italice} [from Sanshō
Peak]{.italice} in his articles "Dōgen Zenji Sanshō dōei no kenkyū"
([道元禅師傘松道詠研究]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) and "Dōgen Zenji
wakashū shinshaku" ([道元禅師和歌集新釈]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). Yōko
Funatsu ([船]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}[津洋子]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), a scholar of Japanese literature, also studied the waka
in [Verses on the Way from Sanshō Peak]{.italice} and wrote, "In my
view, among the waka considered to have been written by Dōgen, there is
no way we can prove that they were really composed by Dōgen
himself."^[375](#calibre_link-404){#calibre_link-869 .calibre13}^ Kōgai
Maruyama ([丸山劫外]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) pointed out a few
mistakes in Funatsu's discussion and concluded that the fifty-three waka
collected by Kishun were truly composed by
Dōgen.^[376](#calibre_link-405){#calibre_link-870 .calibre13}^ Various
scholars have different opinions about whether some or all of the waka
are really Dōgen's or not.

In the Shunjusha text, another thirteen waka are included as addenda.
These were added much later by people who created independent editions
of Dōgen's waka in the Tokugawa period (1603--1868 CE). Because even the
[Record of Kenzei]{.italice} was written about two hundred years after
Dōgen's death, it is difficult to know the true relationship between
Dōgen and the waka attributed to him.

Although modern scholars are skeptical about whether these waka were
composed by Dōgen, there is no information available to prove they were
[not]{.italice} written by him. In any case, for the e-newsletters of
Sanshin Zen community, I have been translating and commenting on these
waka assuming they are Dōgen's. If any evidence to the contrary is
found, I do not mind removing them from the collection. Since I am not a
formal scholar, I cannot determine which poems are definitely Dōgen's
and which are not.

The question that interests me is this: if these [are]{.italice} Dōgen's
poems, what did he want them to teach us? To make connections between
the waka and what Dōgen wrote elsewhere, I quote passages from his other
works that relate to the topics in the poems. I have occasionally given
Dharma talks on these waka, and I have found that talking about the
poems and the teachings underlying them is a useful and focused way to
study Dōgen.

## [D[ŌGEN'S]{.small} W[AKA IN]{.small} M[ODERN]{.small} T[IMES]{.small}]{.boldcapse} {#dōgens-waka-in-modern-times .head}

Dōgen became well known among Japanese intellectuals outside the Sōtō
Zen community after the famous philosopher Tetsurō Watsuji
([和辻哲郎]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1889--1960 CE) wrote his essay
"The Śramaṇa Dōgen" ([沙門道元]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Shamon
Dōgen") in 1926. Watsuji wrote about Dōgen and his ideas, mainly based
on [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} [Zuimonki]{.italice}. He quoted Dōgen's
thoughts on literature and concluded, "Dōgen did not merely oppose
Buddhist art; he also said people should 'ignore any discussions' of
literary arts, poetry, and the like. What purpose do honeyed words and
beautiful passages of literature serve in attaining
enlightenment?"^[377](#calibre_link-406){#calibre_link-871 .calibre13}^

After Watsuji, many Japanese writers became interested in Dōgen and
wrote about him, primarily drawing on [Zuimonki]{.italice} and the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}. At that time Dōgen's poetry was less valued than
his philosophical writings. However, in 1968 when Yasunari Kawabata
([川端康成]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1899--1972 CE) became the first
Japanese novelist to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature, he gave an
acceptance speech entitled, "Japan, the Beautiful, and Myself"
([美しい日本の私]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; "Utsukushii Nihon no
watakushi") in Stockholm. At the beginning of this speech, he introduced
Dōgen's waka number twelve of this book. Since then, Dōgen's waka have
become well known among many Japanese intellectuals. Some of them have
said, among other things, that Dōgen's literature, which negated
literature, opened a new horizon in the world of Japanese literature.

From my perspective as a Buddhist practitioner, these discussions of
modern writers regarding the value of literature sound like idle talk.
From the time of Shakyamuni, Buddhist masters have questioned the
ability of language to express reality beyond discrimination and
conceptualization, and yet these masters all tried to express this
reality using language, including Dōgen. As he discussed in the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Being Able to Speak" ([道得]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Dōtoku"), Dōgen never dismissed the importance of
expressing reality, with or without language.

I hope this collection helps the reader become familiar with various
aspects of Dōgen's teaching. Unless otherwise noted, quotations from
Dōgen Zenji's writings are my own unpublished translations.

As mentioned above, I translated and wrote comments on each waka poem
from [Dōgen Zenji Wakashū]{.italice} for the Sanshin Zen Community's
newsletter over the course of several years. During that period, Musō
Jim Biggs, who was responsible for preparing the newsletter, edited my
English each month. After I had worked through all of the waka, Jōkei
Molly Whitehead compiled the translations and edited the rough draft. We
initially thought the waka and commentary would be published as a
standalone book, but when the decision was made to combine it with the
new translation of [Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki]{.italice}, Shōryū Bradley and
Dōju Layton worked to further edit the text in order make it more
consistent with the style we used in the translation of
[Zuimonki]{.italice}. They worked with Ben Gleason, the editor from
Wisdom Publications, in order to complete this process. I would like to
express my heartfelt gratitude to all of them as well as to the many
others who helped and supported this translation project. Thirteen of
the waka poems were included in [Zen of Four Seasons: Dogen Zenji's
Waka]{.italice}, published by Dōgen Institute on the occasion of the
fifteenth anniversary of Sanshin-ji, so I would also like to thank
everyone who was involved in the production of the book as well.

Through the night

and the day

everything we do in the Way

is the sound and heart of this sutra

The [Dharma Flower Sutra]{.italice} ([法華経]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. [Hokke kyō]{.italice}) is a translation of the Sino-Japanese
abbreviation for the full title of the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice}; the full
title in English would be [Sutra of the Wondrous Dharma of the Lotus
Flower]{.italice} ([妙法蓮華經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [Miàofǎ
liánhuá jīng]{.italice}; Jp. [Myōhō renge kyō]{.italice}; Skt.
[Saddharma]{.italice} [puṇḍarīka sūtra]{.italice}). This is the most
important sutra in Tendai, the school of Buddhism in which Dōgen Zenji
was originally ordained and the tradition in which he studied for
several years []{#calibre_link-1196 .calibre2}before practicing Zen.
Even later in his life, he quotes this sutra in the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} and other writings, and he refers to the [Lotus
Sutra]{.italice} as the "king of sutras." Just before dying, he is even
said to have recited one of its chapters. For Dōgen, the [Lotus
Sutra]{.italice} was not merely a written text; to him, everything we
experience is the sound and heart of the sutra.

In the "Model for Practicing the Way" ([辨道法]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Bendōhō"), one of the six independent writings later
compiled into the [Pure]{.italice} [Standards of Eihei-ji]{.italice}
([永平清規]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Eihei shingi]{.italice}),
Dōgen describes the daily routine of practice in the monks' hall
([僧堂]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [sōdō]{.italice}). The day begins
with evening zazen and ends with afternoon zazen. This means practice
does not begin when monks wake up in the morning and end when they go to
bed, as we usually think. Even sleeping at night is part of daily
practice. Everything done for the Dharma is practice of the Way and the
sound and heart of this sutra.

In the valley

echoes

on the peak

monkeys chattering

I hear them exquisitely expounding this sutra

This is the second of Dōgen's five waka on the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice}.
In the valley there is continuous music, presumably from a stream, and
on the peak monkeys are gibbering intermittently. [Taedae ni]{.italice}
([妙妙に]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) is a play on words, meaning both
"intermittently," and "wondrously" or "exquisitely."

[]{#calibre_link-961 .calibre2}

Dōgen hears the valley stream and monkeys' chattering as wondrous Dharma
or true Dharma. Some commentaries on Dōgen's waka have suggested this
poem may have been composed while Dōgen was a teenaged novice monk at
the Tendai monastery on Mt. Hiei, studying the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice}.

When I lived in Kyoto, I often walked up Mt. Hiei and sometimes saw
troops of monkeys. Since ancient times, these monkeys have been
considered messengers of the guardian god of the mountain. As we do not
know the date of this poem, the scholars' assumption about its
composition could be correct.

However, when I read the five waka about the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice}, I
hear echoes of what Dōgen wrote in the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicles
"Mountains and Waters Sutra" ([山水經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
"Sansui kyō") and "Sounds of Valley Streams, Colors of Mountains"
([谿聲山色]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Keisei sanshoku"). Even
though he uses the title of the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice}, he is not
necessarily referring to the actual written text. In the fascicle of the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} titled "Buddha's Teachings" ([仏教]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Bukkyō"), he wrote:

::: block
The sutra I am talking about is none other than the entire ten-direction
world. There is no time and place that is not the sutra. The sutra is
written in the words of ultimate truth and conventional truth; the words
of the heavenly realm, the human realm, the animal realm, and the
fighting-spirit realm; the words of the hundred grasses and the ten
thousand trees. For this reason, all things long, short, square, or
round, blue, yellow, red, or white, which are stately arrayed throughout
the entire ten-direction world, without exception are the words of the
sutra and the surface of the sutra. We consider them the furnishings of
the great Way and regard them as the sutra of Buddha's family.
:::

When we consider this waka as an expression of this insight, it is also
possible to assume the poem was written much later, at Kōshō-ji
([興]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}[聖寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) or
Eihei-ji ([永平寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}).

Grasping the heart

of this sutra

even the voices of buying and selling

in the world

expound the Dharma

This waka explains that not only nature's sounds, but also merchants'
voices in the marketplace expound the Dharma. Commenting on the [Lotus
Sutra]{.italice}, Tiantai Zhiyi said, "All means of livelihood and
industries in the world, without exception, do not differ from true
reality."^[378](#calibre_link-408){#calibre_link-872 .calibre13}^ In the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "The Bodhisattva's Four Embracing
Actions" ([菩提薩埵四摂法]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Bodaisatta
shishōbō"), Dōgen writes, "To launch a boat or build a bridge is the
practice of [dana-paramita]{.italice}. When we carefully study the
meaning of giving, receiving our body and giving up our body are
offerings. Earning a livelihood and managing a business are, from the
outset, nothing other than
giving."^[379](#calibre_link-409){#calibre_link-873 .calibre13}^

According to some commentaries, this poem expresses the meaning of a
kōan in which the Chinese Zen master Panshan Baoji
([盤山寶積]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Banzan Hōshaku; 720--814 CE)
was awakened upon hearing a comment made by a merchant in a marketplace.
Dōgen Zenji quotes the kōan in [Dōgen's Extensive Record]{.italice}
([永平広録]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Eihei kōroku]{.italice}):

::: block
Once Panshan was walking through the marketplace and saw a customer
buying pork. \[Panshan heard the customer\] say to the butcher, "Cut me
one good piece." The butcher put the knife down, stood with hands folded
in [shashu]{.italice}, and said, "Sir, which is not a good piece?" Upon
hearing these words, Panshan had
insight.^[380](#calibre_link-410){#calibre_link-874 .calibre13}^

I wonder whether or not we in modern times would agree that all the
advertising in various media that stimulates our desire and greed is
still expounding the Dharma.

Colors of mountain peaks

and echoes of valley streams:

all as they are

nothing other

than my Shakyamuni's voice and image

"My Shakyamuni" sounds strange. "Our Shakyamuni" might sound better.
However, this is a literal translation of Dōgen's expression [waga
shakamuni.]{.italice} [Waga]{.italice} is the possessive form of
[ware]{.italice}, or "I." Dōgen is expressing the unity of the self (Jp.
[ware]{.italice}) and Shakyamuni, in this case Shakyamuni's Dharma body
([法身]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [fǎshēn]{.italice}; Jp.
[hōshin]{.italice}; Skt. [dharmakāya]{.italice}), which is the entire
network of interdependent origination. An equivalent expression might be
Dōgen's use of "total function" ([全]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}[機]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [zenki]{.italice}).

Once when I was in high school during final exams, my seat was by a
window. There was a tennis court outside, and the window was covered
with wire netting. I felt imprisoned.

Beyond the tennis court, there was another building. I saw a few birds
on the roof enjoying their lives in the morning sun. They looked
completely free. I erased all the answers I had written on my exam
paper. I wanted to quit school.

After the exam, I walked to the mountainside. It was the end of the
rainy season, and there was a valley stream flowing rapidly.
[]{#calibre_link-976 .calibre2}Like many teenagers, I thought I was a
poet. I wanted to hear exactly what the stream sounded like---not the
meaning of the sound but the sound itself. We have many onomatopoeias in
Japanese for the sounds of flowing water, such as [sarasara]{.italice},
[chorochoro]{.italice}, and [gougou]{.italice}. I wanted to hear the
[real]{.italice} sound. I listened carefully to the stream for about an
hour. I found there was no way to copy the sound with letters.

That was my first meditative experience. I discovered that my emotions
calmed; I was no longer upset. I was fifteen and knew nothing about
Buddhism or Zen. But after that moment, my way of viewing the world
changed forever. I felt that whatever we thought, using words and
concepts was simply an incomplete copy of the sounds of nature, like the
onomatopoeias of flowing water. Since then, when I have had some problem
to consider, and particularly when I fall into negative thinking, I try
to walk in nature and listen to the sounds of flowing water, ocean
waves, wind, or birdsong.

Dōgen Zenji wrote the following in the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle
"Sounds of Valley Streams, Colors of Mountains" ([谿聲山色]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Keisei sanshoku"):

::: block
When we are truly practicing, sounds and colors of the valley, colors
and sounds of the mountains never begrudge the eighty-four thousand
verses. When we do not begrudge our fame, profit, body, and mind,
neither do the valleys and mountains begrudge expounding the Dharma.
:::

The nineteenth chapter of the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice}, "The Blessing of
the Dharma Teacher," ([法師功徳]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Hōsshi
kudoku") says that when practitioners accept, embrace, and explain the
[Lotus]{.italice} [Sutra]{.italice}, they receive numberless blessings
and their six sense organs are purified. When our eyes and ears are free
of the three poisonous minds of greed, anger, and ignorance, the sounds
and colors of mountains and valley streams are revealed as they are.
Although I did not know this when I was fifteen, I may have heard one of
those verses of the valley stream.

Although no one outruns

the horse of sunlight

those who attain the way

are rare

This is the last of Dōgen's waka relating to the [Lotus
Sutra]{.italice}. "The horse of sunlight" is a translation of [hikage no
koma]{.italice}. [Koma]{.italice} means "horse," the fastest runner in
ancient times. [Hikage]{.italice} means "sunlight," or the passing of
time, as in the similar expression [kōin]{.italice} ([光陰]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; literally "light and shadow"). Time is galloping like a
horse. This expression conveys the swiftness of impermanence. In chapter
twenty-two of the [Zhuangzi]{.italice}, "Knowledge Travels North," it is
said, "Human life between heaven and earth is like the passing of a
white horse seen through a crevice in the
wall."^[381](#calibre_link-411){#calibre_link-875 .calibre13}^

We cannot avoid impermanence, but this need not be a negative in our
lives. Dōgen Zenji wrote in the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle
"Thusness" ([恁]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}[麼]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. "Inmo"):

::: block
Even the body is not our personal possession; our life is moving through
the passage of time, and we cannot stop it even for an instant. Where
have our rosy cheeks gone? Even if we wish to find them, there is no
trace. When we carefully contemplate, we understand that there are many
things in the past that we can never see again. The sincere red heart
does not stay either---bit by bit, it comes and goes. Although there is
sincerity, it does not stagnate within the boundaries of the individual,
ego-centered self. Although it is thus, there are some who arouse
awakening []{#calibre_link-1189 .calibre2}mind without any particular
reason. From the time this mind is aroused, we throw away everything we
have been toying with. We wish to listen to what we have never heard,
and we wish to verify what we have never verified. All these are not
simply our personal activities.
:::

Realizing and experiencing impermanence can be a precious opportunity to
arouse the mind of awakening, which allows us to study and practice the
Buddha Way. As Dōgen wrote in the previous four waka on the [Lotus
Sutra]{.italice}, the Dharma is always expounded by all things, and yet
not many people arouse the mind of awakening and attain the Way. In this
poem, Dōgen expresses his sadness about this fact.

In the month of long nights

it snowed on the bright leaves

Why don't those who see this

compose a poem?

[]{#calibre_link-962 .calibre2}

Dōgen and his sangha moved from Kyoto to Echizen province in 1243. The
new monastery, Daibutsu-ji ([大仏寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"})---later
called Eihei-ji ([永平寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"})---was built in 1244.
The opening ceremony for the Dharma hall ([法堂]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [hattō]{.italice}) took place on the first day of the
ninth month. This poem was composed at the end of that month. The monks'
hall was completed shortly thereafter, and the sangha moved into the new
temple.

[Naga-tsuki]{.italice} is the shortened form of [yonaga-tsuki]{.italice}
([夜長月]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), which means the month of
lengthening nights, the ninth lunar month (which can begin anywhere from
the end of September to the first weeks of October). This is normally
the season of changing leaves; snow is rare. However, that year's first
snow fell while yellow and red leaves were still on the trees. It seems
the wind's direction changed, and due to the incoming cold air from
Siberia, the temperature suddenly dropped. This is possible in the
Hokuriku region ([北陸地方]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; [Hokuriku
chihō]{.italice}) where Eihei-ji is located, which faces the Sea of
Japan. Because such a thing never happens in Kyoto, it must have
surprised Dōgen. He uses this rare phenomenon as an expression of the
Dharma.

The whiteness of snow represents oneness, while the bright colors of the
leaves manifest multiplicity. Each tree has its unique nature, shape,
height, flower, fruit, and leaf color. Oneness and multiplicity live
together. How can we express this interpenetration of absolute reality
(oneness and equality) with conventional reality (multiplicity and
diversity)? This is one of the essential points of our Dharma study and
practice. How can we perceive and express the oneness of everything
within the myriad things we encounter?

Precisely because the Dharma

can be inscribed

only at the top of tall rocks

even waves cannot reach

along the rugged shore

Dōgen visited Kamakura for about six months, from the eighth month of
1247 to the third month of the following year. Lord Saimyōji
([西明寺殿]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) was Hōjō Tokiyori
([北条時頼]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};1227--1263 CE), the regent of the
Kamakura shogunate government at the time.

[Kaki]{.italice} means "to write," but also "oyster." [Nori,]{.italice}
translated here as "Dharma," can also mean the seaweed used in making
sushi rolls. Dōgen uses [kaki]{.italice} and [nori]{.italice} here as
puns to create a double image of Kamakura's coast and the nature of
Dharma: a rugged shore where oysters cling to tall rocks, and the Dharma
can be inscribed only beyond reach of the waves of habitual
discriminating thought.

"Separate transmission outside the teachings" is a famous phrase used
for distinguishing the Zen tradition from the so-called teaching
schools. Zen practitioners insisted that the Buddha's heart, or the
absolute Dharma that cannot be described in words, had been transmitted
to them. However, Dōgen criticized this idea in his 1242 fascicle of the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} titled "Buddha's Teachings" ([仏教]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Bukkyō")[.]{.italice} There he wrote, "Therefore, do
not believe the mistaken theory of 'a []{#calibre_link-1076
.calibre2}separate transmission outside the teachings,' and do not
misunderstand what the Buddha's teachings are."

In this waka he says the Dharma can be inscribed, but only on top of
tall rocks beyond the reach of discriminating thought. This observation
is different from the common usage of the phrase "separate transmission
outside the teachings" to declare Zen superior to the written teachings
on which other schools are based. It seems this waka expresses only the
first half of a statement; we might add something like, "We should study
the written teachings and practice them in our actual lives, which are
beyond thinking."

In this world

isn't there one true person?

Of course there is:

the color of the great sky

without any visible limit

"The entire ten-direction world is the true human body" is an expression
often used by Dōgen Zenji. One of the origins of this idea is a saying
of Changsha Jingcen ([長沙景岑]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Chōsa
Keishin; 788--868 CE) that Dōgen quotes in the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}
fascicle "Radiant Light" ([光明]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Kōmyō"):

::: block
The entire ten-direction world is the eye of the śramaṇa. The entire
ten-direction world is the everyday speech of the śramaṇa. The entire
ten-direction world is the entire body of the śramaṇa. The entire
ten-direction world is the radiant light of the self. The entire
ten-direction world exists within the radiant light of the self. Within
the entire ten-direction world, there is no one who is not the self.
:::

[Śramaṇa]{.italice} ([沙門]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[shamon]{.italice}) is a Sanskrit word for a religious home-leaver, that
is, a monk. Shakyamuni Buddha taught that only the five aggregates (Skt.
[skandha]{.italice}) exist, and there is no fixed entity such as the
ātman, soul, or ego that exists as the owner or operator of these
aggregates. The Buddha maintained that the five aggregates of attachment
(Skt. [pañca-upādāna]{.italice}[-skandha]{.italice}) are the root of
suffering (Skt. [duhkha]{.italice}). The aggregates are impermanent and
without any fixed nature, and yet somehow they attach to a view of
themselves as permanent and unchanging and think, "That is me." This
causes the five aggregates to suffer, although there is not actually any
fixed subject we can identify as "the sufferer." This collection of the
five aggregates that attach to themselves is also called Māra, the
embodiment of evil.

In the [Heart Sutra]{.italice} we read, "Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva,
when deeply practicing [prajñā pāramitā]{.italice}, clearly saw that all
five aggregates are empty and thus relieved all suffering." This means
when the bodhisattva sees that the five aggregates are empty and it is
therefore impossible to attach to oneself, all suffering is relieved;
the bodhisattva is nothing other than the five aggregates. When the five
aggregates see their own emptiness and are released from attachment to
themselves, these aggregates are then known as "Avalokiteśvara" rather
than "Māra." Dōgen wrote in the fascicle of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}
titled "Great Perfection of Wisdom" ([摩訶般若波羅蜜]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Maka hannya haramitsu") that the five aggregates are
five instances of [prajñā]{.italice}, or wisdom.

On this issue, there is no discrepancy between the Buddha's teaching,
the [Heart Sutra]{.italice}, and Dōgen's expression. All point to the
transformation of the five aggregates of attachment and suffering to the
five []{#calibre_link-1064 .calibre2}aggregates of emptiness and
freedom. In Dōgen's phrasing in "Great Perfection of Wisdom," this
transformation is called "dropping off body and mind"
([身心脫落]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [shinjin]{.italice}
[datsuraku]{.italice}). The five aggregates are nothing other than body
(form, the first aggregate) and mind (the other four: sensations,
perception, formations, and consciousness). The body and mind liberated
from attachment to themselves are here called the "true human body."
This true human body is never separated from the entire ten-direction
world. Precisely because there is no fixed, independent self that can
exist without relation to all other beings, we say the network of the
entire world is the self. The "true person" (Jp. [makoto no
hito]{.italice}) refers to the selfless self that is connected with all
things.

To understand this waka, it is helpful to know that the Chinese
character for "sky" ([空]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[sora]{.italice}; found here in [ōzora]{.italice}) also means emptiness,
and the Chinese character for "color" ([色]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. [iro]{.italice}) also means form (the first aggregate). The hidden
message in the second half of this waka is "form is emptiness and
emptiness is form" ([色即是空]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}[、]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}[空即是色]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [shiki sokuze kū,
kū sokuze shiki]{.italice})---that is, form (the human body) and
emptiness (the great sky; [大空]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[ōzora]{.italice}) are completely interdependent.

Blown by the spring wind

peach trees in full blossom

without any doubts

extending branches and leaves

[]{#calibre_link-1105 .calibre2}

"Realizing the Way upon seeing peach blossoms" comes from the famous
story of Lingyun Zhiqin ([霊雲志勤]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Reiun
Shigon; n.d.), one of the Dharma heirs of Guishan Lingyou (Ch.
[潙山靈佑]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [潙山霊祐]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}, Isan Reiyū). Dōgen introduces this story in the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Sounds of Valley Streams, Colors of
Mountains" ([谿聲山色]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Keisei sanshoku")
as one of the examples of insentient beings expounding the Dharma.

Lingyun had been practicing the Way for thirty years. Once while he was
walking, he sat down to rest at the foot of a mountain and saw a distant
village. It was spring, so he saw peach trees in full bloom. Suddenly he
realized the Way. He composed a verse and offered it to Guishan:

For thirty years, I have been looking for the sword.

How many times have the leaves fallen, and the branches grown anew?

Since seeing the peach blossoms,

I've had no more doubts.^[382](#calibre_link-412){#calibre_link-876
.calibre13}^

"Looking for the sword" refers to the story of a person whose sword fell
into the water while riding in a boat. He marked the side of the boat
where he had lost the sword, and another person asked, "What are you
doing?" He answered, "I will look for the sword when the boat reaches
the shore."

Lingyun compares his thirty years of practice seeking the Way to someone
who loses his sword overboard and yet searches for it on the shore. The
sword is already far away. During Lingyun's searching, the leaves fell
each autumn and the branches grew each spring. He had not realized that
the Way was right where he walked, where flowers bloom, leaves fall, and
new shoots appear.

In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Buddha-Nature"
([佛性]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Busshō"), Dōgen says, "The roots,
stem, branches, twigs, and leaves are each equally the
Buddha-nature---living the same life and dying the same death as the
same [entire
being]{.italice}."^[383](#calibre_link-413){#calibre_link-877

Forty-some years

have already passed!

I have been walking

the path of rabbit and crow

in the boundless firmament

Dōgen turned forty in 1240. This waka might have been written a few
years later, around the time he moved from Kōshō-ji in Kyoto to Echizen
province to found his new monastery Eihei-ji. In ancient Japan, a day
and night were divided into twelve periods ("hours") named after twelve
animals. Daichi Sokei ([大智祖継]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1290--1366
CE)---a sixth-generation descendent of Dōgen, who was known as a great
poet---wrote instructions to lay practitioners for these twelve periods
called [Dharma Words for the Twelve Hours]{.italice}
([十二時法語]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Jūniji hōgo]{.italice}). In
that text Daichi wrote:

::: block
From the hour of the tiger (3 to 5 a.m.) to the end of the hour of the
cow (1 to 3 a.m.), throughout one day and night, there is no time to
deviate from the continuous practice of the buddha ancestors. If you
spend day and night practicing in accordance with the continuous
practice of the buddha ancestors, then twenty or thirty years, or your
entire lifetime, will be nothing but this one day and
night.^[384](#calibre_link-414){#calibre_link-878 .calibre13}^
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1117 .calibre2}

In Dōgen's waka, the rabbit refers to the moon and the crow to the sun.
Japanese tradition says you can see a rabbit living in the full moon and
a crow with three legs in the
sun.^[385](#calibre_link-415){#calibre_link-879 .calibre13}^ The path of
the rabbit and crow means night and day, and it also signifies boundless
space.

Dōgen Zenji is saying he has been walking the path of the moon and sun,
time and space, and the network of interdependence of all things,
following the Buddha's teachings.

In [Shōbōgenzō zuimonki]{.italice}, Dōgen wrote:

::: block
An ancient said, "Do not spend your days and nights in vain." Now I ask
you: Does time stop passing if we hold it dear? Or does it continue to
pass even if we lament \[its passing\]? I also ask you: Does time pass
vainly? Or do people spend time in vain? This means that we should
practice the Way without spending time
wastefully.^[386](#calibre_link-416){#calibre_link-880 .calibre13}^
:::

This passage is part of Dōgen's speech on the occasion of his Dharma
heir, Ejō, expounding the Dharma as the first head monk ([首]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}[座]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [shuso]{.italice}) of
Kōshō-ji ([興聖寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). He says time never passes
vainly, but we can spend time wastefully. Being mindful here and now, in
each moment, is how we use time and space without wasting them.

The village in deep mountains

I entered seeking the Way

is nowhere but the capital city

I've always lived in

The title of this poem is taken from the nineteenth chapter of the
[Lotus Sutra]{.italice}, "The Blessing of the Dharma Teacher"
([法師功徳]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Hōsshi kudoku"). In this
chapter the Buddha says Dharma teachers who study, uphold, and explain
the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice} will earn uncountable blessings upon their
six sense organs. These senses will thus become pure.

This means when we thoroughly study and understand the truth of the
[Lotus Sutra]{.italice}, we can see the true reality of all beings with
our own eyes, the eyes received from our parents. We do not need to
attain divine eyes, one of the six supernatural powers
([神通]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [jinzū]{.italice}; Skt.
[abhijñā]{.italice}). With our ordinary eyes we can see the colors of
mountains as the Buddha's body and hear the sounds of streams as the
Buddha's voice. This is when all dharmas are the Buddhadharma, as Dōgen
wrote at the beginning of "Genjōkōan."

The [Lotus]{.italice} [Sutra]{.italice} elaborates:

::: block
Such good sons or daughters, with the pure physical eyes received from
their parents at birth, will see whatever exists, whether exposed or
hidden, in the three-thousand great thousand-fold world---the mountains,
forests, rivers, and seas down to the deepest purgatory and up to the
highest heaven. They will see all the living beings in it and recognize
all of the causes and conditions and all of the effects and consequences
resulting from their past
actions.^[388](#calibre_link-418){#calibre_link-882 .calibre13}^
:::

This waka's "village in deep mountains" probably refers to the place in
Echizen province where Dōgen and his sangha moved from Kyoto. The name
Kyoto literally means "capital city." Dōgen moved from the capital to
the remote mountains to found his new monastery []{#calibre_link-1035
.calibre2}for the genuine study and practice of the Dharma. Even though
geographically it was a remote corner of the country, for him, seeing
with the pure eyes of the Dharma, that location in the country was the
true capital, where he had always lived.

Some scholars speculate that Dōgen abandoned Kyoto after failing in
competition with other Zen masters to establish a prominent monastery
like Tōfuku-ji ([東福寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), founded by Rinzai
Master Enni Benn'en ([円爾弁円]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1202--1280
CE). However, at least in Dōgen's mind, he was not fleeing the city
because he lost a competition; rather, I believe his motivation was his
wish to escape competition itself. Kyoto was true saṃsāra, a world of
conflict based on the three poisonous minds of greed, anger, and
ignorance. When he moved to the mountains, he discovered that those
mountains were the true capital city of the Dharma, or nirvana, where he
could focus on studying and practicing with his disciples.

In traditional Zen literature, "capital city" refers to the capital of
the Tang dynasty, Chang'an ([長安]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; in English
literally "eternal peace"). For example, there is this dialogue between
Zhaozhou Congshen ([趙州從諗]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Jōshū
Jūshin; 778--897 CE) and a monk:

::: block
A monk asked, "Does a dog have Buddha-nature or not?"

The Master said, "The door of every house leads to the capital
(Chang-an)."^[389](#calibre_link-419){#calibre_link-883 .calibre13}^
:::

In this dialogue, Zhaozhou says just as the door of every house is
connected to the "capital" (eternal peace, Buddhahood, or nirvana), so
too a dog definitely has Buddha-nature. In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}
fascicle "Buddha-Nature" ([佛性]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
"Busshō"), Dōgen's says the "entire being" of the dog is Buddha-nature.

Spring flowers

summer cuckoos

autumn moon

winter snow doesn't melt

all seasons pure and upright

The "original face" here refers to the true reality of all beings before
it is processed by our discriminating, self-centered minds. This reality
beyond thinking is not something metaphysical but simply concrete,
phenomenal reality as it is. We are included in it. Yet because we are
inside it, we cannot perceive it as the object of our sense organs.
Reality lies beyond the separation between subject and object in which a
subject conceives of things outside itself as objects. Flowers, cuckoos,
moon, snow, and we ourselves are the elements of spring, summer, autumn,
and winter, and each of these particulars fully expresses the entire
season.

We can find an example of the scenery of each season as the true reality
of all things in the lines composed by the Chinese Sōtō Zen Master
Hongzhi Zhengjue ([宏智正覚]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Wanshi
Shōgaku; 1091--1157 CE) that appear as the verse commentary of case 1 in
the [Book of Serenity]{.italice} (Ch. [從容錄]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"},
[Cóngróng lù]{.italice}; Jp. [従容錄]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}, [Shōyō
roku]{.italice}).

The unique breeze of reality---do you see?

Continuously creation runs her loom and shuttle,

Weaving the ancient brocade, incorporating the forms of spring,

But nothing can be done about Mañjuśrī's
leaking.^[390](#calibre_link-420){#calibre_link-884 .calibre13}^

[]{#calibre_link-1093 .calibre2}

The case is titled "The World-Honored One Ascends the Seat." This comes
from a story in which the Buddha one day ascended his seat, and before
he said anything, Mañjuśrī---the bodhisattva of wisdom---struck the
gavel and said, "Clearly observe the Dharma of the King of Dharma; the
Dharma of the King of Dharma is thus." Then the Buddha got down from his
seat without saying anything. This kōan is about the true reality beyond
language---the original face.

In Hongzhi's verse, the word used for "creation" is [kebo]{.italice}
([化母]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), which literally means "the mother who
is the creator of all things." The mother continuously runs her loom and
shuttle, weaving. The horizontal thread (the weft) represents space,
while the vertical thread (the warp) symbolizes time. Using time and
space as her loom, the mother weaves the scenery of each season, as
beautiful as golden brocade. I think Dōgen is expressing the same idea
as Hongzhi: the pure and upright scenery of each season is the true
reality.

"Mañjuśrī's leaking" in the last line of Hongzhi's verse means that, in
contrast to the Buddha's actual silence, Mañjuśrī verbally leaks the
secret by explaining that the silence is the reality beyond dualistic
language. This explanation is really something extra, but without his
leaking it, we would not understand the meaning of the Buddha's silence.
Dōgen's waka is itself another example of this "leaking."

In the Japanese lunar calendar, the first, second, and third months are
spring; the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, summer; the seventh,
eighth, and ninth months, autumn; and the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth
months, winter. New Year's Day in the lunar calendar corresponds to
about February 10 in the Gregorian calendar, so spring is from February
to May; summer, May to August; autumn, August to November; and winter,
November to February.

In the Kyoto region of central Japan, this division into four seasons of
equal length makes sense. However, Japan consists of five main islands,
ranging from Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa in the south. Hokkaido is
at the same latitude as Minnesota, and Okinawa is at that of Florida.
The actual climate in each area differs from the calendar seasons. These
differences are important elements of the []{#calibre_link-1012
.calibre2}Japanese seasonal sensitivity. For example, in waka number
six, Echizen province---where Dōgen lived at the time of writing---had
snow at the end of the ninth month, which would be very unlikely in
Kyoto where he used to live. That is the basis of his surprise and the
motif of the poem. Similarly, in waka number fifty, Dōgen says that
although everything is still covered with snow, it is spring. And he
finds a sign of spring in the first call of a warbler.

Waterbirds

fly away and return

leaving no trace

even so, they do not forget

the path

The expression "activating the mind without dwelling" in the title
appears in the Chinese translation of the [Diamond]{.italice}
[Sutra]{.italice} by Kumārajīva ([鳩摩羅什]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Ch. Jiūmóluóshí; Jp. Kumarajū; 344--413 CE). It means we should keep our
minds functioning without attachment to any objects. Bodhisattvas are
free from attachment to objects, and yet their minds do not become
lifeless. Bodhisattva practice is not bringing our minds to a halt.

This expression has been important in Zen tradition because it was used
in the enlightenment story of the Sixth Ancestor, []{#calibre_link-1051
.calibre2}Dajian Huineng ([大鑒惠能]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
Daikan Enō; 638--713 CE). One version says Huineng became awakened when
he heard someone chanting the [Diamond Sutra]{.italice} while he was
selling firewood. Another version says he was awakened when the Fifth
Ancestor Daman Hongren ([大満弘忍]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Daiman
Kōnin; 601--674 CE) taught him this expression during the midnight
Dharma transmission between the two ancestors.

In this poem, Dōgen Zenji expresses a fundamental characteristic of
bodhisattva practice using the analogy of migratory birds. These birds
fly amazingly long distances each year without leaving any trace, yet
they never forget the path that leads to their precise destination. They
transmit this path from generation to generation without a trace.

In the fascicle of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} "Only Buddha Together with
Buddha" ([唯佛與佛]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Yuibutsu yobutsu"),
Dōgen wrote:

::: block
Also, concerning birds flying in the sky, there is no way for animals
walking on the earth to know the birds' tracks. They cannot follow the
birds' path by seeing their traces even in their dreams. Because they do
not know that there is such a path, they cannot even imagine it. And yet
a bird can see the traces of hundreds or thousands of small birds having
passed in flocks, or the tracks of so many lines of large birds having
flown to the south or migrated to the north.

Because the Dharma is

beyond the words I spoke

it leaves no trace

in my brushstrokes

"Not depending on words and letters" ([不立文字]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [fury]{.italice}ū [monji]{.italice}) is a famous
motto of Zen. This expression is often used together with the phrase
"mind-to-mind transmission" ([以心伝心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [i
shin den shin]{.italice}). According to scholars, these expressions were
coined between 750 and 850 CE in China, around the time of Mazu Daoyi
([馬祖道一]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Baso Dōitsu; 709--788 CE) and
Shitou Xiqian ([石頭希遷]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Sekitō Kisen;
700--790). The scholar Jeffrey Broughton suggests it may have originated
with the prominent monk Guifeng Zongmi ([圭峰宗密]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Keihō Shūmitsu 780--841 CE), citing the following
passage from Zongmi:

::: block
Bodhidharma received dharma in India and personally brought it to China.
He saw that most of the scholars of this land had not yet obtained
dharma, that their understanding was based merely on scholastic
nomenclature and numerical lists and that their practice was concerned
only with phenomenal characteristics. Because his desire was to inform
them that the moon does not lie in the finger \[pointing at the moon\]
and that dharma [is]{.italice} our mind, he just \[raised the slogan\]
"a mind-to-mind transmission ([i shin den shin]{.italice}); no
involvement with the written word ([furyū
monji]{.italice})."^[391](#calibre_link-421){#calibre_link-885
.calibre13}^
:::

Since then, together with "separate transmission outside the teaching"
([教外別伝]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [kyōge betsuden]{.italice}),
these expressions have been used as []{#calibre_link-1183 .calibre2}Zen
catchphrases to declare Zen's superiority over Buddhist schools based on
scriptures.

However, it is interesting to note that Dōgen did not use the phrase
"not depending on words and letters" in either the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} or [Dōgen's Extensive Record]{.italice}
([永平広録]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Eihei]{.italice}
[kōroku]{.italice}). He did use "mind-to-mind transmission" in two
fascicles of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}: "Entanglement"
([葛藤]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp." Kattō") and "Insentient Beings
Expounding Dharma" ([無情説法]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Mujō
seppō"). In the latter, Dōgen used the expression in a negative way.

We must be careful when we read this waka and consider what Dōgen is
expressing here about this cliché. Dōgen never negated the significance
of language. In [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} "Being Able to Speak"
([道得]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Dōtoku"), Dōgen wrote:

::: block
When we are able to speak of the speakable, we do not-speak of the
unspeakable. Even if we recognize that we are able to speak of the
speakable, unless we penetrate the fact that the unspeakable is what we
are not-able-to-speak, we have not yet attained the face of the
buddha-ancestors or the marrow of the buddha-ancestors.
:::

In this passage, Dōgen treats "not-speak" as an active verb instead of a
simple negation of speaking. In this waka, Dōgen does not say that we
should stop using a brush to write words. We should understand and
express what we can to the limits of language, but we should also pay
attention to the unspeakable. Dōgen's style is to go beyond thinking by
thinking thoroughly. This resembles his saying from
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} "Seeing the Buddha" ([見佛]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Ken butsu"): "Seeing form and seeing no-form is
seeing the Tathāgata."

Mandarin ducks

or seagulls?

Impossible to distinguish

floating and sinking

among the rising waves

The title of this poem, "Mind itself is Buddha," is a famous saying of
Mazu Daoyi ([馬祖道一]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Baso Dōitsu;
709--788 CE). Dōgen Zenji quotes this expression from the story of Damei
Fachang ([大梅法常]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Daibai Hōjō; 752--839
CE) in several places in the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} and [Dōgen's
Extensive Record]{.italice} ([永平広録]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[Eihei kōroku]{.italice}). In [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} "The Mind Is Itself
Buddha" ([即心是仏]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Sokushin ze butsu"),
Dōgen cautions us not to interpret the mind as our psychology prior to
arousing the mind of awakening, or as our original nature as something
permanent. He writes:

::: block
The mind that has been authentically transmitted is "one mind is all
Dharmas; all Dharmas are one mind. . . ." We clearly understand that the
mind refers to the mountains, rivers, and the great earth; the sun, the
moon, and the stars. . . . Therefore, "mind itself is Buddha" refers to
all the buddhas who carry out arousing the mind of awakening, practice,
awakening, and nirvana. Those who have not yet been carrying out \[these
things\] are not "mind itself is buddha."
:::

In "Dharma Discourse 319" in [Dōgen's Extensive Record]{.italice}, Dōgen
quotes the story of Damei's sitting in the mountains for thirty years
after hearing Mazu's "mind itself is Buddha," and comments:

[]{#calibre_link-1155 .calibre2}

::: block
We should know that zazen is the decorous activity of practice after
realization. Realization is simply just sitting. At this monastery we
have the first monks' hall, so in this country of Japan this is the
first we have heard of this, the first time we have seen it, the first
time we have entered it, and the first time sitting in a monks' hall.
This is fortunate for people studying the Buddha way. . . .

This "mind itself is Buddha" is very difficult to understand. Mind is
fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles, and Buddha is a glob of mud or a
clump of soil; Kiangsi \[Mazu\] expressed trailing mud and dripping
water, Damei realized lurking in the grass and sticking to trees. Where
can we find this mind itself is
Buddha?^[393](#calibre_link-423){#calibre_link-887 .calibre13}^
:::

In zazen practice we sit right within the reality beyond separation,
where "the mind itself is Buddha" manifests. Dōgen is saying this mind
is not within the dichotomy of mind and body or subject and objects.
This mind includes body and mind, self, and all things in the universe.
This mind is the entire network of interconnected origination. The
dichotomies exist, but it is impossible to make ultimate distinctions
between them.

In this waka, he expresses "mind itself is Buddha" using the scenery of
a lake or seashore. The mandarin duck is a common bird in East Asia. A
male mandarin is very colorful, and a seagull is white. Since they
differ in appearance, it is easy to distinguish them under normal
conditions unless they are far away. Possibly this is a scene at dawn or
twilight when the birds are silhouetted, or in a fog or mist. The
mandarin duck prefers freshwater but may also winter in coastal lagoons
and estuaries, so the two can be found together. In this waka I think
Dōgen portrays the scenery of our zazen.

Even without knowing he protects rice

the scarecrow

in the mountain's small paddy

doesn't exist in vain

In the fall when rice ripens, many birds come to eat it, and the farmers
put scarecrows in their mountain paddies to protect the rice. Scarecrows
in Japan often look like monks wearing black robes and bamboo hats.
Because this waka refers to a small paddy on a hidden mountain, it is
clear that no one sees or appreciates the scarecrow. Even the scarecrow
himself does not know he is guarding rice; he is simply standing in a
field. However, he is actually protecting the rice.

In Menzan's version of this waka collection, the title of this poem is
"zazen." Zazen is not for our personal benefit. My teacher's teacher,
Kōdō Sawaki Rōshi ([沢木興道]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1880--1965 CE),
said satori in zazen practice is like a burglar sneaking into an empty
house. Although the burglar finally enters after strenuous effort, there
is nothing to gain once he is there. According to a worldly view, that
kind of an effort would be a waste of time, yet zazen has benefits
beyond calculation. This is what Dōgen Zenji meant when he wrote in
"Genjōkōan": "When buddhas are truly buddhas they do not need to
perceive they are buddhas; however, they are enlightened buddhas and
they continue actualizing Buddha."

A nearly identical waka is included in the [Recorded Sayings of Zen
Master]{.italice} [Bukkoku]{.italice} ([佛國禪師語錄]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Bukkoku zenji goroku]{.italice}) which is a
collection of the words of the Rinzai Zen master Kōhō Kennichi
([高峰顕日]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1241--1316 CE), the abbot of the
temple Kenchō-ji ([建長寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) in Kamakura.
Because of the similarity, scholars question whether this waka is really
Dōgen's.

Waves settle

and wind calms

a tiny discarded boat drifts unmoored

the middle of the night

is completely the world of the moon

The title of this poem uses the term s[hōbōgenzō]{.italice}, which
translates to "true Dharma-eye treasury." It is the term for the Dharma
that has been transmitted from Shakyamuni through the succession of
ancestors. Dōgen used this expression as the title of the essay
collection that is his masterpiece.

In this poem, he describes the scenery of the ocean during a beautiful
night. The wind and waves have died down, so it is very peaceful. A
small, untied boat floats freely. The moon shines over this entire
world, embracing everything within itself.

This waka reminds me of a verse composed by Xuedou Chongxian
([雪竇重顯]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Seccho Jūken; 982--1052 CE).
Dōgen quoted this verse in [Instructions for the Cook]{.italice}
([典座教訓]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Tenzo kyōkun]{.italice}):

One character, three characters, five, and seven characters.

Having thoroughly investigated the ten thousand things,

None has any foundation.

At midnight the white moon sets into the dark ocean.

[]{#calibre_link-963 .calibre2}

When searching for the black dragon's pearl,

You will find they are

Dōgen also quotes a saying by Panshan Baoji ([盤山寶積]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Banzan Hōshaku; 720--814 CE) in the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Moon" ([都機]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. "Tsuki"): "The mind-moon is alone and completely round. Its light
swallows the myriad phenomenal things. The light does not illuminate
objects. Nor do any objects exist. Light and objects simultaneously
vanish. Then what is this?" In this fascicle, the moon, which normally
is a symbol for the absolute, is said to be present everywhere without
any separation.

When we read Xuedou's verse and Panshan's saying, I do not think we need
much explanation to appreciate this waka. One important detail is the
loose and discarded boat. I think this represents the five aggregates
(body and mind) dropped off ([身心脫落]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[shinjin datsuraku]{.italice}), releasing us from self-clinging. To me
this waka, like waka 15, depicts our zazen.

[Nehan myōshin,]{.italice} meaning "wondrous mind in nirvana," is often
used with the expression [shōbōgenzō]{.italice}, or "true Dharma-eye
treasury." [Shōbōgenzō nehan myōshin]{.italice} refers to the life of
bodhisattvas based on the true reality of all things, which is both form
and emptiness. In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Total Function"
([全機]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Zenki"), Dōgen wrote, "The great
Way of all buddhas, when it is completely penetrated, is liberation and
manifestation." Things are manifested completely as they are, and yet at
the same time, they are liberated from what they are due to impermanence
and no-self.

Bodhisattvas live in non-abiding; because of their wisdom they do not
abide in saṃsāra, and yet because of their compassion they do not abide
in nirvana. In saṃsāra they live conditioned lives, walking with all
beings, and yet in each of their steps eternal nirvana is revealed.

In this waka, "these flowers" blooming in the original place ("home
village") of bodhisattvas are what Dōgen called "flowers of emptiness."
Dōgen wrote a fascicle of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} titled "Flower of
Emptiness" ([空華]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Kūge") in which he
commented on Bodhidharma's expression "A flower opens with five petals":

::: block
The true Dharma-eye treasury, the wondrous mind in nirvana that has been
authentically transmitted without interruption until today, is called
cataract-eyes and flowers of emptiness. Awakening, nirvana, Dharma-body,
self-nature, and so on are two or three of the five petals that flowers
of emptiness open.
:::

In this passage, "two or three petals" represents the phenomena of our
day-to-day conventional reality, while "five petals" is the absolute
reality beyond discrimination. Dōgen sees each and every flower that
blooms and falls (phenomena) as a flower of emptiness (the absolute).
Flowers arise and perish, yet never arise or perish. Not only flowers,
but also every phenomenal being and our practice activity are examples
of the five petals of the flower of emptiness. They are always simply
expressing the colors of emptiness. Spring passes, and yet the colors of
emptiness never change.

In my grass hut

sleeping or waking

I always recite

"I take refuge in Shakyamuni Buddha;

bestow your compassion upon us!"

If we have read only Dōgen Zenji's philosophical writings, the feeling
this waka expresses might seem out of character for him. However, in the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Mind of the Way" ([道心]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Dōshin") he wrote, "Asleep and awake, we should
consider the merit of the Three Treasures. Asleep and awake, we should
chant the Three Treasures."^[396](#calibre_link-426){#calibre_link-890
.calibre13}^

For Dōgen, Shakyamuni Buddha was not one particular Buddha among many
Buddhas in Mahāyāna Buddhism. In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle
"The Mind Is Itself Buddha" ([即心是仏]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
"Sokushin ze butsu"), he wrote:

::: block
The term "all buddhas" refers to Shakyamuni Buddha. Shakyamuni is
nothing other than "mind itself is Buddha." All buddhas in the past,
present, and future, when they become buddha, unfailingly become
Shakyamuni Buddha. This is "mind itself is Buddha."

My teacher Kōshō Uchiyama Rōshi had ill health throughout his life. From
his early twenties, he lived with tuberculosis. When he could not
practice zazen because of his physical condition, he silently chanted
the name of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara, repeating the phrase [namu
Kanzeon bosatsu]{.italice} ([南無觀世音菩薩]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
literally "homage to Avalokiteśvara bodhisattva"). He often said that
zazen and chanting a buddha's or bodhisattva's name, whether Shakyamuni,
Amitābha, or Avalokiteśvara, are basically the same; these are merely
different names for the total functioning of the network of
interdependent origination through which we are enabled to live.

In [Opening the Hand]{.italice} [of Thought]{.italice}, Uchiyama Rōshi
wrote:

This small [I]{.italice} is embraced by the immeasurable and boundless
Amitabha Buddha. . . . It does not depend on whether I believe it or
not. I am, in fact, embraced and saved by the immeasurable and boundless
Amitabha. Being thankful for this, I chant [Namu]{.italice} [amida
butsu]{.italice}. When we say this with our mouths, we are expressing
our deep sense of gratitude. When we perform it with our whole body, it
is zazen as the activity of the reality of life, the zazen of believing

Even though because I'm dull-witted

I won't become a buddha

[]{#calibre_link-1047 .calibre2}

I wish to be a monk

helping all living beings

cross over

This waka is about the first of the four bodhisattva vows, "Beings are
numberless; I vow to free them" ([衆生無邊誓願度]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [shujō muhen]{.italice} [sei gan do]{.italice}). To
"free" or "save" is a translation of [do]{.italice} ([度]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), which means to "cross over." According to Buddhist
teachings, between this shore of saṃsāra and the other shore of nirvana
lies a big river. A bodhisattva is like a ferryman who helps people
across the river. This vow actually means the following: "I will not
cross over and enter nirvana until I finish helping all living beings
cross." This is an endless vow with an unreachable goal.

In the fascicle of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} "Arousing the Mind of
Awakening" ([發菩提心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Hotsu bodai
shin"), Dōgen Zenji said, "To arouse the mind of awakening means to take
the vow, 'Before I myself cross over, I will help all living beings
cross over,' and strive to fulfill this vow. Even if their outside
appearance is humble, those who have aroused this mind are already the
guiding teachers of all living beings."

In [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} [zuimonki]{.italice}, Dōgen wrote:

::: block
All the buddhas and ancestors were originally ordinary people. While
they were ordinary people they certainly did bad deeds and had evil
minds. Some of them might have been dull-witted or even fools. However,
since they followed their teachers, relied on \[the Buddha's\] teaching
and practice, and transformed themselves, they all became buddhas and
ancestors.

Today's people should also do the same. We should not disparage
ourselves, thinking we are foolish or dull-witted. If we do not arouse
the mind \[of awakening\] in this present lifetime, when can we expect
to? If we are fond of \[the Way\], we will surely attain
it.^[398](#calibre_link-428){#calibre_link-892 .calibre13}^
:::

Even if we have aroused the mind of awakening, received the bodhisattva
precepts, and taken the bodhisattva vows, we cannot be
[]{#calibre_link-1016 .calibre2}like the great bodhisattvas such as
Avalokiteśvara, Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra, and Kṣitigarbha. We are still
ordinary deluded beings. We may make many mistakes, but we still must
help ourselves and others to find nirvana within saṃsāra. Actually,
there is no boundary between saṃsāra and nirvana. Each time we do even a
small thing to help others, free of self-centeredness, we experience
nirvana here and now.

How delightful!

I was able to meet

Shakyamuni's Dharma

I will never, ever walk

another path

This waka contains a double image that does not come through in the
translation. In another possible interpretation, [afumi-gusa]{.italice}
is what is now called [aoi-gusa]{.italice} ([葵草]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), or [futaba-aoi]{.italice} ([二葉葵]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), in modern Japanese. This is a plant known as hazelwort
or wild ginger in English, a low-growing herb found in forests with the
scientific name [Asarum caulescens]{.italice}. [Futaba-aoi]{.italice}
has long been the emblem of the Kamo shrines ([賀茂神社]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Kamo jinja), which are two of the oldest Shinto
shrines in Kyoto, dating to the sixth and seventh centuries. The annual
festival held at these shrines, the Aoi Matsuri ([葵祭]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) on May 15, is named for this plant and is one of the
three main yearly festivals in Kyoto even today. [Futaba-aoi]{.italice}
was also used in the crest of the Tokugawa shogunate family that ruled
during the Edo period (1600--1868 CE).

In this waka, [afumi]{.italice} is a pun on the verb that means "to
meet" or "to encounter." [Kake]{.italice} in [kaketemo]{.italice}, which
means "not at all" in the []{#calibre_link-1068 .calibre2}context of
this waka, can also mean "to hang." During the festival,
[futaba-aoi]{.italice} is hung everywhere. So, the hidden image in this
waka is the scenery of early summer. I am not sure why the joy of
meeting the Buddhadharma and the Aoi Matsuri are connected here.
Possibly, Dōgen Zenji wrote this waka to someone on the day of the
festival, or the plant was blooming then.

In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Virtue of Leaving Home"
([出家功徳]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Shukke kudoku"), Dōgen wrote
about how rare and precious it is to encounter the Buddhadharma:

::: block
Not only have we already received a human body, which is difficult to
receive, but we have also encountered Buddhadharma, which is rare to
encounter. We should immediately discard all mundane associations, leave
home, and study the Way. Kings, ministers, wives, children, and
relatives can be encountered wherever we go. Buddhadharma is as
difficult to encounter as an uḍumbara flower \[which blooms only once
every three thousand years\].
:::

And in the fascicle of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} called "Taking Refuge
in the Three Treasures" ([歸依三]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}[寶]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Kie sanbō), Dōgen
quoted Shakyamuni's teaching about the reasons we should take refuge in
the Buddha, Dharma, and sangha:

::: block
Being fearful of oppressive suffering, many people take refuge in gods
in mountains, parks, forests, solitary trees, shrines, and so on. Taking
refuge in such gods is neither excellent nor precious. By taking refuge
in such gods, it is not possible to be liberated from the many kinds of
suffering.

If all beings take refuge in Buddha, Dharma, and sangha, and in the four
noble truths, they clearly observe \[reality\] with wisdom, they will
understand their suffering, the cause of suffering, the eternal
transcendence of suffering, and the eightfold noble path that leads to
the peace of nirvana. []{#calibre_link-1149 .calibre2}Taking refuge in
these is most excellent and precious. By taking refuge in the Three
Treasures, it is possible to be liberated from the many kinds of
suffering.

Those who do not ride

on the four horses

and in the four carriages,

how could they know the true Way?

In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Four Horses" ([四馬]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Shime"), Dōgen Zenji quotes teachings about four
kinds of horses from a sutra in the [Connected Discourses]{.italice}
([雜阿含經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Zō agon kyō]{.italice}; Skt.
[Saṃyukta āgama]{.italice}) and the [Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa
Sūtra]{.italice} ([大般涅槃經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Dai
hatsunehan]{.italice} [gyō]{.italice}).

In the [Connected Discourses]{.italice}, the Buddha taught there are
four kinds of horses. The first is most sharp-witted. It starts when it
sees only the shadow of the whip and understands what the rider wants.
The second pays attention when the whip touches its hair. The third
notices when the whip strikes its flesh. The fourth wakes up only after
the whip has penetrated to the
bone.^[399](#calibre_link-429){#calibre_link-893 .calibre13}^

The Buddha explained the first horse is like people who realize
impermanence after someone in another village dies; the second, when
someone in their own village dies; the third represents those who
realize impermanence when their parent dies; and the fourth, those who
do not accept impermanence until they are facing their own death.

[]{#calibre_link-1221 .calibre2}

According to the [Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]{.italice}, the first
horse resembles people who accept the Buddha's teaching when they hear
of the suffering of birth; the second, when they learn of birth and
aging; the third, after seeing birth, aging, and sickness; and the
fourth, only after perceiving birth, aging, sickness, and death.

In this waka, riding on the four horses signifies realizing impermanence
and the suffering of life, accepting the Buddha's teachings, and
arousing the mind of awakening. The four carriages refer to the sheep
cart (representing the path of the [śrāvaka]{.italice}), deer cart (the
path of the [pratyekabuddha]{.italice}), ox cart (the path of the
bodhisattva), and great white ox cart ("the one vehicle," which includes
all of the previous three) that appear in the third chapter of the
[Lotus Sutra]{.italice}. Riding in the four carriages means studying and
practicing any Buddhist teachings or traditions. The [Lotus
Sutra]{.italice} claims only the last of the four represents the
Buddha's true teaching, but Dōgen does not make such a discrimination.

We all see the reality of impermanence and various kinds of suffering in
human life, but we do not often arouse the mind of awakening and ride
the carriages of the Dharma. So how can we know the true Buddha way?

An example of seeing impermanence and consequently arousing the mind of
awakening can be seen in the story of Paṭacārā, considered the foremost
"Keeper of the Vinaya" among nuns and one of the leading female
disciples of Shakyamuni Buddha. Impermanence was engraved in her heart
through extremely difficult experiences.

Paṭacārā was a beautiful and self-motivated daughter of a rich merchant
in Kosala. When she was young, she fell in love with a servant of her
parents. She fled her parents' home to marry him, and they lived as
farmers in a distant village for several years. When she was pregnant
with her second child, she decided to return to her parents' home to
give birth, but on their way a storm with heavy rain and thunder
overtook them. Her husband went into a forest to get some trees to make
a temporary shelter, but he was bitten by a poisonous snake and died.
Paṭacārā continued to walk with their first child and the baby she had
given birth to that night.

[]{#calibre_link-1090 .calibre2}

When she came to a river, it was swollen due to the heavy rain, so she
decided to take her children one by one across the river. She left her
older son on the shore and carried the newborn baby across. While she
was returning to her older son, she screamed as she saw a vulture take
her baby in its talons and fly away. Then, hearing his mother's voice,
the older boy thought she was calling him and entered the river, which
swept him away in its strong current. Having lost her husband and two
children, Paṭacārā continued to walk toward her hometown. When she
arrived, she heard that her parents' house had collapsed during the
storm, killing her parents and brother. Paṭacārā had lost her entire
family in one day.

Paṭacārā went insane---howling, tearing her clothes, and wandering here
and there, weeping and wailing. After a while, she came to Jetavana
monastery, where Shakyamuni was staying. He instructed his disciples not
to obstruct her but to let her enter and come near him. She asked the
Buddha to help her. The Buddha taught her about impermanence and said,
"Paṭacārā, do not think you have come to someone who can help you. In
your many lives, you have shed more tears for the dead than there is
water in the four oceans." After he had given more teachings, Paṭacārā
asked the Buddha to accept her as his
disciple.^[400](#calibre_link-430){#calibre_link-894 .calibre13}^

Still today, many people have experiences of suffering similar to
Paṭacārā's because of natural disasters and human-made events such as
war and other kinds of violence. The question is whether we can use such
experiences to awaken. And as with the four horses, how much suffering
is necessary for us to do so?

[Higurashi]{.italice} ([日暮]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"} or
[蜩]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) is the Japanese name for the evening
cicada ([Tanna japonensis]{.italice}). It can be found all over Japan
where it calls in the evening and early morning. In haiku,
[higurashi]{.italice} is a seasonal word denoting early autumn, but
actually these insects chirp beginning in early summer.
[Higurashi]{.italice} literally means "closer of the day." A summer day
is long, but if we spend it carelessly and wastefully, there is no way
to retrieve it.

Cicadas represent the brevity of life. They stay underground for some
years as larvae, but once they mature and appear above ground, they live
a matter of weeks at most. They chirp wholeheartedly while they can,
without wasting time. Their song expounds the Dharma of impermanence,
urging us to live mindfully and attentively each moment.

Dōgen Zenji discussed the preciousness of every day in the fascicle of
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} titled "Continuous Practice" ([行持]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Gyōji"):

::: block
Thus, a single day must be of great importance. If we live vainly for a
hundred years, we will regret the days and months we wasted, and be sad
for our bodies. Although we run around as slaves to sounds and sights
for a hundred years, if we are able to practice even for one single day
within that time, not only will we put our whole lives of a hundred
years into this practice, we will also save those hundred years. We
should cherish this body and life of one day through practice; we should
respect this body through practice.

By the spring wind

my words

are blown and scattered

people may see them

the song of flowers

[Koto]{.italice} [no ha]{.italice} ([言の葉]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"})
literally means "leaves of words," referring both to words in general
and to a waka poem. On a spring day, flowers, probably cherry blossoms,
are blown by the wind and fall to the ground. Dōgen's mind was also
blown about by the spring wind, and a waka poem formed from the leaves
of words. This is what "my words are blown and scattered" means. It also
means Dōgen does not cling to his scattered words.

In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Sounds of Valley Streams, Colors
of Mountains" ([谿聲山色]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Keisei
sanshoku"), Dōgen comments on a poem by the famous Chinese poet Su Shi
([蘇軾]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Soshoku; 1036--1101 CE) that says
the sounds of valley streams are the voice of Shakyamuni expounding the
Dharma and the colors of the mountains are the pure body of Buddha. When
we are liberated from the five aggregates of attachment (Skt.
[pañca-]{.italice}[upādāna-skandha]{.italice}), the objects of our sense
organs cease to be the objects of our thoughts and desires
([nāma-rūpa]{.italice}). Then, as Dōgen says at the beginning of
"Genjōkōan," we see the myriad things as Buddhadharma.

When Dōgen writes this poem about falling flowers, he is expounding this
truth. And yet, people probably think his poem is about admiring the
beauty of the falling flowers as [nāma-rūpa]{.italice}. Snow, moon, and
flowers are such common motifs in poetry that people might consider any
poem about flowers to be hackneyed.

In [The Zen Poetry of Dōgen]{.italice}, the scholar Steven Heine offers
another possible interpretation. He suggests that "the song of flowers"
means []{#calibre_link-1213 .calibre2}the song sung [by]{.italice} the
flowers.^[401](#calibre_link-431){#calibre_link-895 .calibre13}^ In this
unusual interpretation, the poem is not a thing written by someone
observing the flowers' beauty from a human perspective. Instead, the
poem itself is the singing of the flowers.

It seems the mountain spring wind

has begun to blow

on peaks and in valleys

myriad flowers are shining

[Azusayumi]{.italice} literally means a "catalpa bow," but here it is
used as a [pillow word]{.italice} ([枕詞]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[makura kotoba]{.italice}), a traditional poetic epithet, in this case
to indicate the season of spring. Steven Heine translates
[nioi]{.italice} as "fragrance," but the word originally referred to
color.^[402](#calibre_link-432){#calibre_link-896 .calibre13}^ It can be
translated as "shining," "luminous," or "bright."

This poem expresses the beauty of midspring, with its countless flowers.
This is one of the most striking times of year. After a long and cold
winter, the world becomes lovely and vigorous again. We, too, become
joyful, and in Japan people host parties underneath the cherry blossoms.
It is fine to enjoy the beautiful spring, but we need to remember that,
particularly for farmers, this is also the time to prepare for working
in the fields. The time of flowers is brief. Another long, hot, and
humid summer is coming.

Near the end of [Instructions for the Cook]{.italice}
([典座教訓]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Tenzo kyōkun]{.italice}),
where Dōgen discusses the significance of magnanimous mind
([大心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [daishin]{.italice}) beyond
discrimination, he says: "Carrying half a pound, do not take it lightly;
lifting forty pounds should not seem heavy." We need to live with
steadiness through both favorable and adverse []{#calibre_link-1169
.calibre2}circumstances, without being overwhelmed by whatever
conditions that may arise.

Ancient gods

whom Shinto priests in cotton sashes

worship and rely on

please bestow mercy

on this Buddhist monk too

in his robe with hemp sleeves

In his book, [Dōgen no waka]{.italice} (Dōgen's waka), Akio Matsumoto
([松本章男]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) assumes this waka is about the
annual Shinto event at the end of summer, on the thirtieth day of the
sixth month at the Kamo shrines in
Kyoto.^[403](#calibre_link-433){#calibre_link-897 .calibre13}^ Matsumoto
suggests Dōgen composed the poem while he was in Kyoto at this festival.
Although he was a Buddhist monk, Dōgen asks for mercy from the Shinto
gods.

Buddhism was officially introduced to Japan in the sixth century CE.
Initially there were some conflicts between people who supported
Buddhism and others who thought they should not worship what they
perceived to be a foreign god (the Buddha). However, Buddhism and
Shintoism quickly became syncretized. By the time of Dōgen, this
blending of the two religions had become part of Japanese culture. As in
other Asian Buddhist countries, Japanese Buddhism did not fight against
the country's native folk beliefs, in this case what we now call Shinto.
Some people thought of Shinto gods as living beings who were still
transmigrating in saṃsāra and wanted to take refuge in Buddhism to be
released into nirvana. Others saw Shinto gods as manifestations
[]{#calibre_link-1193 .calibre2}of buddhas, bodhisattvas, or Buddhist
guardian deities, an idea called [honji suijaku]{.italice}
([本地垂迹]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; literally "manifestations of the
original ground"). Many Shinto shrines included Buddhist temples, and
many temples had shrines. This mingling continued until the second half
of the nineteenth century, when the Meiji government intervened to
separate Shintoism and Buddhism under a policy called [shinbutsu
bunri]{.italice} ([神仏分離]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). Because Buddhism
originated outside Japan, the government concluded it was not useful in
promoting nationalism.

As this poem shows, Dōgen was not opposed to Shinto. Instead, it seems
that for him and many other Japanese people, Shinto was not seen as a
distinct religion but simply a Japanese way of life.

As destinies driven only

by their ignorant minds

people seem to walk

the path of the six realms

One of Buddhism's best-known teachings is transmigration within the six
realms of saṃsāra's cycle of rebirth (heavenly beings, human beings,
fighting spirits, animals, hungry ghosts, and hell dwellers).
"Destinies" here does not mean a kind of specific, predetermined fate,
but rather that depending on the karma we create in this lifetime, we
will be reborn in a particular realm in the next lifetime; this process
will continue without release. This ceaseless movement is caused by the
three poisonous minds of greed, anger, and ignorance. The Buddha taught
the way of liberation from this cycle through the practice of the
eightfold path.

[]{#calibre_link-1040 .calibre2}

The final word of the last line, [ran]{.italice}, expresses a
conjecture. In this waka, Dōgen says people "seem to walk" instead of
concluding that they are actually walking the path of the six realms.
Most likely he means that at least some of these people are
intentionally walking the path of saṃsāra to carry out their bodhisattva
practice based on their vows.

In "Sounds of Valley Streams, Colors of Mountains"
([谿聲山色]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Keisei sanshoku"), Dōgen
comments, "After having aroused the mind of awakening, even if they
transmigrate within the six realms through the four kinds of birth, the
causes and conditions of transmigration will become practices and vows
for awakening."

Here, Dōgen points to one of the most important teachings of Mahāyāna
Buddhism: the oneness of saṃsāra and nirvana. In his [Talk on]{.italice}
[the Wholehearted Practice of the Way]{.italice} ([辨道話]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Bendōwa]{.italice}) Dōgen urges, "You should
completely awaken to life-and-death as exactly nirvana. You can never
speak of nirvana as outside
life-and-death."^[404](#calibre_link-434){#calibre_link-898 .calibre13}^
"Life-and-death" ([生死]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[shōji]{.italice}) as a Buddhist term refers to saṃsāra: repeatedly
being born, living, and dying.

In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Life-and-Death"
([生死]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Shōji"), Dōgen explains:

::: block
Seeking after buddha outside life-and-death is like trying to go to Yue
in the south with the front of our cart heading north or trying to see
the northern stars \[the Big Dipper\] while facing south. If we seek
buddha outside life-and-death, we accumulate the causes of
life-and-death even more and lose the path of liberation. Just
understand that life-and-death is itself nirvana and neither dislike
life-and-death nor seek after nirvana. Only then can we be released from
life-and-death.

After the long, long night

as long as

the dragging tail of the copper pheasant

morning finally dawns!

[Ashibiki]{.italice} [no]{.italice} here is a pillow word that means
"mountain;" originally it may have referred to the tiring process of
climbing a mountain. [Yamadori]{.italice} literally means mountain bird,
but this word refers specifically to the copper pheasant ([Syrmaticus
soemmerringii]{.italice}), which has chestnut-colored plumage and a long
tail. [Shidario]{.italice} is the dragging tail of the bird.

The first four lines are an adaptation of a famous waka attributed to
celebrated poet Kakinomoto Hitomaro ([柿本人麿]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; d. 708 CE) and included in the famous compilation [One
Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets]{.italice} ([百人一首]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Hyakunin isshu]{.italice}). Dōgen borrowed the first
four lines of his waka from Hitomaro's but changed the last line:
"[Ashibiki no / yamadori no o no / shidario no / naga-nagashi]{.italice}
[yo wo / hitori ka mo nemu]{.italice}" (Must I sleep alone through the
long night, as long as the tail of the copper pheasant?) It is said that
male and female copper pheasants sleep separately, so Hitomaro's waka is
about the loneliness of a couple or family living separately.

In Dōgen's waka, the "long night" refers to
life-and-death---transmigration in the six realms of saṃsāra. Beings
have been living a long time in the darkness of ignorance. Yet even such
a long night driven by ignorance within saṃsāra ends with dawn, thanks
to the study and practice of the Dharma and faith in Buddha's
compassion. This is the common understanding of the phrase "long night"
in Buddhism. It seems this waka expresses the surprise of seeing the
morning beginning to dawn after the long night and the joy of the
brightness of the sun. []{#calibre_link-980 .calibre2}This is the
turning point of our lives from the first and second noble truths to the
third and fourth.

In [Dōgen]{.italice}['s Extensive Record]{.italice}
([永平広録]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Eihei kōroku]{.italice})
volume seven, "Dharma Discourse 479," Dōgen quotes a saying by the
Buddha: "Life-and-death is long; life-and-death is short. If we rely on
greed, anger, and foolishness, then \[the cycle of suffering of\]
life-and-death is long. If we rely on precepts, samadhi, and wisdom,
then this life-and-death is
short."^[405](#calibre_link-435){#calibre_link-899 .calibre13}^

According to this saying, the dark night of ignorance need not be long.
When we change the foundation of our lives from the three poisonous
minds to the three basic practices (precepts, samadhi, and wisdom), then
the transformation from night to day is actualized here and now.

In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Arousing the Mind of Awakening"
([發菩提心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Hotsu bodaishin"), Dōgen
writes:

::: block
Arousing the mind of awakening is first arousing the mind of ferrying
others before oneself. . . . Having aroused this mind, we meet with
innumerable buddhas and make offerings to them, we see buddhas and hear
Dharmas, and further arouse the mind of awakening. It is like adding
frost on snow. . . . When we compare
[anuttara-samyak-sambodhi]{.italice} (supreme awakening) with first
arousing the mind of awakening, they are like the [kalpāgni]{.italice}
and the light of a firefly. However, when we arouse the mind of ferrying
others across before ourselves, these two are not at all different. . .
. This mind is neither one's self nor others; it does not come \[from
somewhere else\]. However, after having aroused this mind, when we touch
the great earth, everything becomes gold, and when we stir the great
ocean, it becomes sweet dew.
:::

[Kalpāgni]{.italice} is a Sanskrit compound of the words for "aeon"
([kalpa]{.italice}) and "fire" ([agni]{.italice}); it refers to the fire
that burns down the entire world at the end of the so-called
[kalpa]{.italice} of dissolution, the third of four [kalpas]{.italice}
in traditional Indian cosmology. There are four [kalpas]{.italice} that
comprise a []{#calibre_link-1078 .calibre2}full cyclic age: (1) the
[kalpa]{.italice} of creation, (2) the [kalpa]{.italice} of abiding, (3)
the [kalpa]{.italice} of dissolution, and (4) the [kalpa]{.italice} of
nothingness. The [kalpāgni]{.italice} is an unfathomably large fire on a
universal scale, while the light of a firefly is tiny. Our first
aspiration for awakening is as tiny as the flash of a firefly, whereas
the Buddha's ultimate awakening is vast like [kalpāgni]{.italice}, and
yet the nature of these two is the same.

In the same text Dōgen adds, "Within this swiftness of the arising and
perishing of transmigration in each [kṣaṇa]{.italice}, if we arouse one
single thought of ferrying others before ourselves, the eternal
longevity \[of the Tathagata\] immediately manifests
itself."^[406](#calibre_link-436){#calibre_link-900 .calibre13}^

These sayings show both sides of Dōgen's teaching---long, continuous
practice on the one hand and immediate transformation on the other.

Those fellow beings

who wander in delusion

here and there

within the six realms

are actually my mothers and fathers

The twentieth minor precept in the [Brahmā]{.italice} [Net
Sutra]{.italice} (Ch. [梵網經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}, [Fànwǎng
jīng]{.italice}; Jp. [梵網経]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}, [Bonmō
kyō]{.italice}) says the following:

::: block
My disciples, you should compassionately engage in the practice of
releasing captive animals into the wild. All men have been our fathers,
and all women our mothers. . . . If we were to slaughter and eat them,
it would be the same as slaughtering []{#calibre_link-1134 .calibre2}and
eating my own parents, as well as slaughtering \[and eating\] my own
former body.^[407](#calibre_link-437){#calibre_link-901 .calibre13}^
:::

Dōgen might have resonated personally with this understanding of all
beings as one's family because of the sadness and loneliness of losing
his mother when he was very young.

In [Shōbōgenzō zuimonki]{.italice}, he wrote:

::: block
Filial piety and obedience are most important to carry out. Yet there is
a difference between laypeople and home-leavers when it comes to
performing filial piety. Laypeople keep the teachings in the [Classic of
Filial Piety]{.italice}, and so on, serve their parents while they are
alive, and hold services after their deaths. All worldly people know
this. Home-leavers abandon their debts of gratitude and enter the realm
of nondoing. Within the family of nondoing, the manner \[of paying off
debts of gratitude\] must not be limited to one particular person.
Considering that we have debts of gratitude to all living beings just as
we do to our own fathers and mothers, we must transmit all the merits of
our good deeds throughout the \[entire\] Dharma world. We do not limit
\[the dedication of merit\] specifically to our own parents and in this
\[one\] lifetime. This is how we do not violate the Way of nondoing. In
our continuous day-to-day practice and moment-to-moment study, simply
following the Buddha Way is the true fulfillment of filial piety. . .
.\[However,\] we should see that our debts of gratitude to all living
beings are as important \[as the debt to our
parents\].^[408](#calibre_link-438){#calibre_link-902 .calibre13}^
:::

Although Dōgen said in [Zuimonki]{.italice} that monks do not hold
memorial services for their parents, in [Dōgen's Extensive
Record]{.italice} we find that Dōgen gave memorial Dharma discourses for
his mother and father in his later
years.^[409](#calibre_link-439){#calibre_link-903 .calibre13}^

Even to the hedges

of humble gardens

spring has come

people gather young greens

in the ancient field

In the East Asian lunar calendar, spring begins on New Year's Day, which
corresponds to about February 10 in the Gregorian calendar. This is the
biggest celebration of the year for Japanese people. In Japan, people
used to count their age differently. At birth, they were already
considered one year old. On New Year's Day everyone became one year
older. In a sense, New Year's Day was everyone's birthday. Spring and
the new year come without discrimination even to humble homes.

"Gather young greens" refers to the custom of eating rice gruel with
seven kinds of young greens ([春の七草]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp[.
haru no nana kusa]{.italice}) growing at that time of year. This custom
still continues in Japan.

"The ancient field" is a translation of [furuno]{.italice}
([古野]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), which appeared in Menzan's version of
this poem instead of "ancient shallows" or "ancient rapids"
([古瀬]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; [furuse]{.italice}) which appears in
the Shunjusha text and earlier manuscripts. To me, it makes more sense
to gather greens from a field rather than from a stream, but it is
possible that [furuse]{.italice} was a specific place, or that he meant,
"by the stream." Anyway, in interpreting this poem as an expression of
Dharma, the contrast between "young" and "ancient" is important.

In chapter fifteen of the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice}, "Spring Up out of the
Earth" ([従地湧出]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Jūchi yushutsu") there
is a parable in which numberless old bodhisattvas rise from the earth.
[]{#calibre_link-1163 .calibre2}Shakyamuni Buddha says these old
bodhisattvas are his disciples. People wonder how the disciples can be
so much older than Shakyamuni, like children older than their father. In
the following chapter, Shakyamuni explains that his life span is
eternal.

In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle titled "The Dharma Flowers Turn
the Dharma Flower" ([法華轉法華]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}: Jp. "Hokke
ten hokke"), Dōgen wrote: "In general, at the time of the Dharma flower,
without fail the father is young and the son is old. It is not that the
son is not the son, or that the father is not the father. We should just
learn that truly the son is old and the father is young."

In this case, Dōgen likens the young father to our moment-by-moment
practice, which gives birth to, or manifests, an old son, representing
the eternal life of Shakyamuni's Dharma body. Shakyamuni said in the
[Sutra on the Teachings Bequeathed]{.italice} [by the Buddha]{.italice}
([佛遺教經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [Fóyíjiào jīng]{.italice}; Jp.
[Butsuyuikyō gyō]{.italice}), "From now on all of my disciples must
continuously practice. Then the Thus Come One's Dharma body will always
be present and
indestructible."^[410](#calibre_link-440){#calibre_link-904 .calibre13}^

At the beginning of spring

before transplanting rice seedlings

farmers hold festivals

praying to the gods of Hirose and Tatsuta shrines

for a fine harvest

This is another waka about Shinto practice. Hirose and Tatsuta shrines
are both near one of the oldest and most famous temples in Japan,
Hōryū-ji ([法隆寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) in Nara. Suijin
([水神]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; god of water) is []{#calibre_link-1053
.calibre2}enshrined in Hirose, and Fūjin ([風神]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; god of wind) in Tatsuta. These are the guardian gods of
agriculture. In early spring farmers would organize festivals to pray
for a good harvest of rice. At these festivals, they performed plays
about growing rice.

Following Menzan Zuihō's [Commentary on the Verses]{.italice} [on the
Way from Sanshō Peak]{.italice} ([傘松道詠聞解]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Sanshō dōei]{.italice} [monge]{.italice}), a
commentary on Dōgen's waka collection, commentators in the Sōtō Zen
tradition interpreted this waka as the bodhisattvas' prayer to the gods
and buddhas for protection until their ultimate awakening (harvest)
after arousing the mind of awakening (planting seedlings). The most
important prayer for a bodhisattva is to pray for support from all
beings to continue practicing and fulfill one's vows.

Despite beholding

the moon of the mind

in the great sky,

deluded in darkness

I praise its shape and color

"The moon of the mind" ([kokoro no tsuki]{.italice}) is the key phrase
in this waka. What is the meaning of "mind" here? As I discussed
regarding the theme of the moon in waka number seventeen, the fascicle
of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} called "Moon" ([都機]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Tsuki") is helpful for understanding what Dōgen
might have meant. In that fascicle, Dōgen quotes Zen Master Panshan
Baoji's saying:

[]{#calibre_link-965 .calibre2}

::: block
The mind-moon is alone and completely round. Its light swallows the
myriad phenomenal things. The light does not illuminate objects. Nor do
any objects exist. Light and objects simultaneously vanish. Then what is
this?

The moonlight swallows all things; there is nothing outside it. This is
what "alone and completely round" means.
:::

In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "The Mind Is Itself Buddha"
([即心是仏]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Sokushin ze butsu"), Dōgen
wrote the following:

::: block
The mind that has been authentically transmitted is "one mind is all
Dharmas; all Dharmas are one mind." For this reason an ancient said,
"When we understand the mind, there is not an inch of soil on the great
earth." We should know that when we understand the mind, the entire sky
is struck down and the whole earth is ripped apart.
:::

[Ōzora]{.italice} ([大空]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) is literally the
"great sky," but it also can mean "great emptiness." In the conception
of mind discussed above, all things, both subject and objects, are
included in it. "Great" means absolute, before separation between
subjects (sense organs) and their objects. [Iro]{.italice}
([色]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) is "shape and color," but this kanji can
also mean "form," as in "form and emptiness" in the [Heart
Sutra]{.italice}. We commonly appreciate the moon in the sky as an
object of our eyes and entertainment for our mind, and we may feel joy
or sadness. However, Dōgen says this perception is merely delusion in
the darkness.

We can interpret this waka in two ways. It could be an admonishment to
people who see the moon merely as an object of their minds, and an
expression of Dōgen's regret for his own limited perception. Most
commentators interpret the waka in this way. The other possibility is to
understand the poem as a reflection of Dōgen's appreciation of the
beautiful moon as an object of his mind, as it is expressed in many
other of his waka poems.

[]{#calibre_link-966 .calibre2}

In this case, "deluded in darkness" is not really negative. It is like
returning to delusion from great realization, as in the fascicle of the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} "Great Realization" ([大悟]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Daigo"). Great realization is seeing the ultimate
truth of emptiness, equality, and oneness beyond discrimination. Yet
being caught up and staying there is not our practice. We return to
delusion and function by embracing the conventional and relative reality
as our daily lives.

Waka number thirty-nine also supports both of these interpretations:

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Seeing flowers in spring

crimson leaves in autumn

and white snow in winter

I regret having appreciated them

as objects of my feelings

In this waka, Dōgen changes "mind-moon" to the beauty of spring, autumn,
and winter. Yet as in waka number thirty-two, I do not feel he sincerely
regrets appreciating the many beauties of the seasons as objects. Waka
number fifty-three, Dōgen's final waka---about the harvest moon shortly
before his death---is the same.

Both interpretations might be true: although Dōgen felt some regret for
objectifying the world's beauty in his perception and his poetry, he was
also deeply grateful that he could appreciate it. As long as human
beings live, we naturally interpret the world as an object of our
senses, and this kind of perception, which is our delusion, leads us
both to further delusion and to joy. This is one aspect of awakening to
the human nature of bodhisattvas, who are ordinary human beings even
though they are living by bodhisattva vows.

How venerable

the seven buddhas'

ancient words!

Studying them

we go beyond the six realms

"Seven buddhas" refers to Shakyamuni and the six buddhas prior to him.
The idea of seven buddhas (Skt. [saptatathāgata]{.italice}) appears in
the Pali [Nikāyas]{.italice} and Chinese [Āgamas]{.italice} and thus
probably pre-dates Mahāyāna Buddhism. [Furu kotoba]{.italice} ("ancient
words") refers to the admonitions that were taught by the seven buddhas.
The most well-known of these is by Kāśyapa Buddha, the sixth buddha: "Do
not what is evil. Do what is good. Keep your mind pure. This is the
teaching of Buddha."^[411](#calibre_link-441){#calibre_link-905
.calibre13}^ This verse also appears in the [Dhammapada]{.italice}.

The [Dhammapada]{.italice} includes another verse: "Some people are born
on this earth; those who do evil are reborn in hell; the righteous go to
heaven; but those who are pure reach
Nirvana."^[412](#calibre_link-442){#calibre_link-906 .calibre13}^ The
traditional understanding of these verses is that the first two lines on
not doing evil and doing good are about transmigration within saṃsāra
based on cause and effect, and the third line about keeping one's mind
pure is the teaching of going beyond saṃsāra and entering nirvana.

Dōgen wrote a fascicle of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} titled "Not Doing
Evil" ([諸]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}[悪莫作]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. "Shoaku makusa"). At the very beginning, he quotes this verse and
comments:

[]{#calibre_link-1055 .calibre2}

::: block
This teaching, as the general precept of the ancestral school from the
seven buddhas, has been authentically transmitted from former buddhas to
later buddhas, and later buddhas have received its transmission from
former buddhas. It is not only of the seven buddhas: it is the teaching
of all buddhas.
:::

He continues,

::: block
This being so, when we study the supreme unsurpassable true awakening
([anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi]{.italice}), when we hear the teachings,
practice, and verify the results, it is profound, far-reaching, and
wondrous. We hear of this supreme awakening, sometimes following a
teacher and sometimes following the sutras. At the beginning, it sounds
like, "Do not do any evil." If we do not hear "Do not do any evil," it
is not the true Dharma of buddhas; it must be the suggestion of demons.
We should know that which says "Do not do any evil" as the true Dharma
of buddhas.
:::

In this passage, we see that Dōgen interprets the teachings in the verse
as an integration of two sets of teachings: the worldly Dharma (Skt.
[laukika]{.italice}) of causality based on good and evil actions, and
the ultimate awakening beyond the six realms (Skt.
[lokottara]{.italice}). Bodhisattvas go beyond saṃsāra yet they do not
escape from saṃsāra, just as a lotus flower blooms beyond the surface of
the muddy water while its roots are still in that water.

From beginning to end

everything is unreal

as white tangled hair shows

even while confused by conflicting emotions

we should clarify this as a dream

[Itsuwari]{.italice} means false, untrue, or fictitious. I translate
this word here as "unreal." This means that everything is without any
fixed self-nature, and therefore everything is changing all the time.

[Tsukumogami]{.italice} is old people's white, tangled hair, which
symbolizes impermanence and emptiness. This word is written in kanji as
[九十九髪]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}. This is a play on words.
[髪]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"} ([kami]{.italice}; here "[gami"]{.italice}
due to the compound causing a sounds shift) is hair. [九十九]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"} means "ninety-nine," signifying very old people. In kanji,
"one hundred" is [百]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}. Ninety-nine is one
hundred minus one. When we remove the character that means "one"
([一]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) from the top of the character that means
"hundred" ([百]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), the result is the character
for "white" ([白]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}).

Our lives change just as the color of our hair changes. We cannot
naturally have our original hair color again or become young again. When
we look back, our youth seems as unreal as a dream. Within our
dream-like lives, we are always confused by conflicting emotions and
various thoughts coming and going. We worry about so many things as if
they were real. Particularly in our old age, what we did when we were
young seems like a dream, and often we feel sad reflecting on it. We may
even think we are no good anymore.

The end of the [Diamond Sutra]{.italice} includes the following:

All conditioned things are

like a dream, a phantom, a bubble, a shadow,

like a dewdrop,

and also like a flash of lightning.

We should see them thus.^[413](#calibre_link-443){#calibre_link-907

[]{#calibre_link-1187 .calibre2}

In [Verses on the]{.italice} [Way from Sanshō Peak]{.italice}
([傘松道詠]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Sanshō dōei]{.italice}), the
collection of Dōgen Zenji's waka compiled and edited by Menzan Zuihō,
the title of this waka is "Clarifying the Dream within the Dream"
([夢中説夢]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Muchū setsumu"). Dōgen
composed a fascicle of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} with this same title,
where he wrote, "This place of clarifying the dream within the dream is
the homeland of buddhas and ancestors and the assemblies of buddhas and
ancestors." When we dream, we believe that what we see and think is
real. However, when we awaken to the reality of impermanence and no
fixed self, or emptiness, we can clearly see everything is like a dream.

Whether summer or winter

Koshi's mountain

is free of discrimination

it sees equally

the falling of white snowflakes

and the roaring of thunder

The mountain of Koshi ([越の山]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) may refer to
the sacred Mt. Hakusan ([白山]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; literally
"white mountain"). Koshi was the old name of the large area in the
Hokuriku region ([北陸地方]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; [Hokuriku
chihō]{.italice}) that included the provinces of Echizen, Kaga, Etchū,
and Echigo. In ancient times, the mountain was called Koshi no Shirane
([越白嶺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; meaning "the white peak of Koshi")
because this mountain peak turned white earlier than the lower mountains
and remained white even after snow disappeared elsewhere. Since the Nara
period (eighth century CE), Hakusan has been considered a sacred
mountain in []{#calibre_link-1041 .calibre2}[shugendō]{.italice}
([修験道]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), the Japanese mountain tradition of
asceticism and shamanism, which incorporates both Shinto and Buddhist
concepts. Near Eihei-ji, a temple named Heisen-ji ([平泉寺]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) was one of the three starting points of a trail to climb
Hakusan.

There is a story in Dōgen's biography, the [Record of Kenzei]{.italice}
([建撕記]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Kenzei ki]{.italice}),
regarding the god enshrined on Hakusan called Myōri Daigongen
([白山妙理大権現]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). The day before Dōgen
returned to Japan from China, he tried to copy the [Blue Cliff
Record]{.italice} (Ch. [碧巖錄]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}, [Bìyán
lù]{.italice}; Jp. [碧巌録]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}, [Hekigan
roku]{.italice}). Because it was a large text, he did not have enough
time to finish it. In the night, Myōri Daigongen appeared and helped
Dōgen copy the text. Later in Sōtō Zen tradition, Myōri Daigongen was
taken to be the guardian god of Eihei-ji.

The sacred mountain Hakusan does not discriminate between summer and
winter. The mountain is immovable, accepting all the different
conditions of the four seasons, including roaring thunder in summer and
snow in winter.

This waka reminds me of what Dōgen wrote in [Instructions for the
Cook]{.italice} ([典座教訓]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Tenzo
kyōkun]{.italice}): "As for what is called magnanimous mind, this mind
is like the great mountains or like the great ocean; it is not biased or
contentious mind. . . . The four seasons cooperate in a single scene;
regard light and heavy with a single
eye."^[414](#calibre_link-444){#calibre_link-908 .calibre13}^

The capital city

must still blaze with tinted autumn leaves;

in this deep mountain

hailstones this morning

hailstones this evening

[]{#calibre_link-1190 .calibre2}

This waka might have been composed in the tenth lunar month (which can
begin anywhere from late October to early November) of 1243, the
beginning of the first winter after Dōgen and his disciples moved from
Kōshō-ji in Kyoto to Echizen province. Just like waka number six, this
poem may express the surprise he felt due to the different weather.

In Japanese, a small hailstone is called [arare]{.italice}. Such
hailstones often appear in early winter or spring when the temperature
hovers around freezing, that is, not too cold. Along the coast of the
Sea of Japan, these small hailstones were a precursor to a long, dark,
snowy winter. Particularly for Dōgen, who had lived in Kyoto most of his
life, this must have been a change.

Kōdō Sawaki Rōshi interpreted Dōgen's contrast between his experience in
the capital city and the deep mountains as the mundane world versus the
world of zazen. In the everyday world, all kinds of different things are
happening rapidly inside and outside of us, and we run this way and that
without a decisive direction. In zazen, when we turn our light inward
and illuminate our selves, everything is equally one color---"white"
like the hailstone---and each moment is eternity. As in waka number six,
Dōgen uses white to symbolize reality beyond discrimination or
multiplicity. White can also represent purity. In Chinese Zen texts,
black or darkness is more often used to refer to nondiscriminatory
reality.

My grass hermitage

in the white mountains of Echizen

during winter retreat

ice and snow are covered in clouds

[]{#calibre_link-1194 .calibre2}

As previously noted, Koshi is another name for the area that included
Echizen province, where Eihei-ji is located. This poem probably
describes the middle of the first winter after Dōgen moved from Kyoto, a
little after the time when the previous poem was composed.

When the wind coming from Siberia crosses the Sea of Japan and strikes
the mountains, it then rises, freezes, and falls as snow. Thus, the
regions facing the Sea of Japan receive heavy snow every winter.
Sometimes they get more than ten feet at once, which can bury entire
towns.

This must have been gloomy scenery for Dōgen and his monks from Kyoto.
Before Eihei-ji was built, they lived in Yoshimine-dera
([吉峯寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), a small, old temple without a
kitchen and located on the top of a mountain. It is said that Tettsu
Gikai ([徹通義介]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1219--1309 CE), later the
third abbot of Eihei-ji, was the head cook ([典座]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [tenzo]{.italice}) at that time. Even in the snow, he
had to carry food up the steep hill from the house where it was cooked.
In these difficult conditions Dōgen Zenji wrote about thirty fascicles
of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} before moving into the newly built temple
of Daibutsu-ji (later renamed Eihei-ji) in the autumn of 1244.

The snowy mountains of Echizen province are often hidden by thick, gray
clouds. In his Dharma talk on this waka, Kōdō Sawaki Rōshi commented
that "winter retreat in the white mountains" is our
zazen.^[415](#calibre_link-445){#calibre_link-909 .calibre13}^ Ice and
snow refer to negative conditions of our minds, and the clouds are
emptiness. Although negative mental states influenced by the three
poisonous minds can become frozen and persist, they are always enveloped
in a cloud of [prajñā]{.italice} that knows the emptiness of all things.
This zazen mountain is far from the city of saṃsāra; it can be cold and
gloomy but still serene and quiet, free of the noise of delusion.

Holding this day dear

at the end of spring

working on this or that

here and there

As in waka number twenty-five, the phrase [azusayumi]{.italice} is used
to indicate spring. This poem describes people working hard on the last
day of the third month, which is the end of spring.
[Hikitodomu]{.italice} means to prevent something or someone from
leaving. I translate this as "holding this day dear."
[Ochikochi]{.italice} literally means "distant and close"---"here and
there" in terms of space, or "present and future" in terms of time.
Dōgen Zenji compassionately thinks of everyone working hard on the final
days of spring to complete things that should be done before summer
comes.

The end of spring in the East Asian lunar calendar corresponds to about
May 10 in the Gregorian calendar. The beginning of spring and the New
Year----around February 10 in the Gregorian calendar----is the coldest
time of year. Particularly in Echizen province where Dōgen Zenji lived,
snow is typical until the end of March. Therefore, even though the first
three months of the year are spring according to the calendar, the
actual feeling of springtime is very short. The most beautiful time of
year is midspring, around the equinox, with many flowers, especially
cherry blossoms, in the mountains and fields. People are released from
the cold weather and relax and enjoy the beauty of the season.

Right after this brief respite, in late spring, farmers have to work
hard to prepare for the growing season. They have many things to take
care of, including the planting of the rice fields, before the rainy
season begins. Thus farmers hold the end of spring dear, wishing its
days were longer.

At Zen monasteries this is also a busy time. The summer practice period
begins soon, on the fifteenth day of the fourth month, around the end of
May. Monks are busy preparing for ninety days of intense
[]{#calibre_link-1233 .calibre2}practice during the hot and humid
summer. Since many monks change roles among departments, they have to
learn new skills. New training monks begin to arrive for the practice
period. Senior monks have to train the young monks to be ready to
practice with everyone, following the rules, forms, and procedures.

There is another manuscript in which this waka's last line reads
[ochikochi yasen]{.italice}, meaning "wandering here and there." In this
scenario, Dōgen Zenji, cherishing the beautiful scenery, strolls here
and there to savor the last moments of spring.

In my grass hut

standing or lying down

I constantly say:

I vow to ferry others

before myself

[Mōsu]{.italice} ([申す]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) is a humble form of
the verb of "to say" or "to speak." Dōgen is vowing this to the Three
Treasures. The first three lines of this waka are almost the same as
waka number nineteen:

In my grass hut

sleeping or waking

I always recite

"I take refuge in Shakyamuni Buddha;

bestow your compassion upon us"

And the meaning of the last two lines is the same as waka 20:

Even though because I'm dull-witted

I won't become a buddha

I wish to be a monk

helping all living beings

cross over

In [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} "Arousing the Mind of Awakening"
([發菩提心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Hotsu bodaishin"), Dōgen
Zenji quotes a verse from the [Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]{.italice}
([大般涅槃經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Dai hatsunehan
gyō]{.italice}) in which Kāśyapa Bodhisattva praises Shakyamuni Buddha:

::: block
Arousing the mind of awakening and the mind of the ultimate stage are
not different; between these two stages of mind, the former is more
difficult to arouse. It is the mind of ferrying others across before
oneself. For this reason, I respectfully make prostrations to those who
first aroused the mind of awakening. []{#calibre_link-1139
.calibre2}When they first arouse the mind of awakening, they are already
the teachers of human and heavenly beings. They are superior to
[śrāvakas]{.italice} and [pratyekabuddhas]{.italice}. Arousing such a
mind of awakening surpasses the triple world. Therefore, it can be
called the unsurpassable.
:::

"Arousing the mind of awakening" is one of the key phrases in Dōgen's
teaching. According to his writings there are three aspects to the way
the mind of awakening functions. It functions as compassion, as he
writes in this poem and in [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} "Arousing the Mind of
Awakening." It also functions as wisdom through the perception of
impermanence. Another way it operates is by transmitting and maintaining
the traditional way of practice.

In [Points to Watch in Practicing the Way]{.italice}
([学道用心集]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Gakudō
yōjinshū]{.italice}), Dōgen writes about the mind of awakening as
wisdom:

::: block
The Ancestral Master Nāgārjuna said that the mind that solely sees the
impermanence of this world of constant appearance and disappearance is
called bodhi-mind. . . . Truly, when you see impermanence, egocentric
mind does not arise; neither does desire for fame and
profit.^[416](#calibre_link-446){#calibre_link-910 .calibre13}^
:::

Dōgen explained the third aspect of the mind of awakening in [Pure
Standards]{.italice} [for the Temple Administrators]{.italice}
([知事清規]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Chiji shingi]{.italice}):

::: block
What is called the mind of the Way is not to abandon or scatter the
great Way of the buddha ancestors, but deeply to protect and esteem
their great Way. . . . After all, not to sell cheaply or debase the
worth of the ordinary tea and rice of the buddha ancestors' house is
exactly the mind of the Way.^[417](#calibre_link-447){#calibre_link-911
.calibre13}^
:::

Both "mind of the Way" ([道心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[dōshin]{.italice}) and "mind of awakening" or "bodhi-mind"
([菩提心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [bodaishin]{.italice}) are
translations of []{#calibre_link-1140 .calibre2}Sino-Japanese terms that
were originally used to translate the Sanskrit word

Though we idle away

many days and nights

the times we seek the way

are so rare

In my commentary on the previous poem, I introduced the three aspects of
arousing the mind of awakening: compassion, or helping all living beings
arouse the mind of awakening; wisdom in realizing impermanence and not
wasting time; and maintaining the tradition by esteeming and protecting
daily activities within the buddha-ancestors' great Way.

Even though we arouse the mind of awakening by witnessing the sickness,
aging, or death of people close to us, or through our own experiences of
facing the reality of impermanence, we often lose sight of this truth
and are distracted by all of the miscellaneous things that are
attractive to us. Although we understand we have no time to waste, we
often want to escape facing impermanence and seek something that gives
us temporary excitement and joy even when we know such things will not
give us a stable foundation for our lives. On top of that, we have many
responsibilities and obligations to our families, work, and society. We
forget the Way, and either let ourselves become too lazy or too busy to
do anything meaningful.

We need to reflect on how to build a stable foundation for our lives. In
[Shōbōgenzō zuimonki]{.italice} section 3-14, Dōgen instructed:

[]{#calibre_link-1157 .calibre2}

::: block
It goes without saying that you must consider the inevitability of
death. . . . Even if we do not consider this \[right now\], we should
resolve not to waste time and to refrain from doing meaningless things.
We should spend our time carrying out that which is worth carrying out.
Among the things we should do, the most important thing is to understand
that all deeds other than those performed by buddhas and ancestors are
useless.
:::

What Dōgen addresses here is the third aspect of the mind of awakening.
This is his admonition to monks practicing at his monastery. Monastic
practice is designed to maintain the traditional way of life. Some
practices originated from Indian Buddhist monasticism, while others are
from customs in Chinese or Japanese Zen monasteries. These include
zazen, various services and ceremonies, work to support community life,
and the study of Dharma, among other things. Dōgen encourages monks to
maintain these practices without being diverted by personal desires or
ties to the mundane world.

Most American Zen practitioners do not live in monasteries. We need to
consider how to spend our daily lives without wasting time. Although
"not wasting time" sounds like always working hard, pursuing more and
more efficiency like workaholics, in fact, being mindful and peaceful
here and now with what we are doing is a practice that is deeply
intimate with the Way.

On his head

a magpie might make its nest

[]{#calibre_link-1091 .calibre2}

a spider's web is

hanging from his eyebrows

[Itadaki]{.italice} means "crown of the head" or "mountain summit."
Here, it refers to the crown of the head of a person who is sitting
zazen. [Kasasagi]{.italice} means "magpie," a bird related to crows that
is found in many parts of the world. In Europe, this bird generally has
a negative association. It has been demonized in some countries.
However, in China and Korea the magpie is considered a bird of good
fortune. In Japan, it is said this bird was imported from Korea in the
sixteenth century. Since then magpies have lived in various places in
western Japan. Probably Dōgen did not have a chance to see this bird
with his own eyes except when he was living in China, but its name
appears in Buddhist texts.

[Ran]{.italice} is a particle that attaches to verbs to express
conjecture. In this waka, Dōgen did not actually see the bird making a
nest. [Sasagani]{.italice} literally means "little crab," but here it
refers to a spider. A spider is called a little crab probably because it
has many legs and a crab-like walk. [Kakareri]{.italice} here is a
statement that does not express any conjecture; Dōgen suggests that he
actually sees the spider's web hanging from the eyebrow of the person
sitting.

In the [Record of the Transmission of the Light]{.italice}
([伝光録]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Denkōroku]{.italice}), Keizan
Jōkin ([瑩山紹瑾]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1268--1325 CE) wrote about
Shakyamuni Buddha's practice after he left his father's palace:

::: block
Shakyamuni Buddha was of the Sun Race in India. At the age of nineteen
he leaped over the palace walls in the dead of night, and at Mount
Dantaloka, he cut off his hair. Subsequently, he practiced austerities
for six years. Later, he sat on the Adamantine Seat, where spiders spun
webs in his eyebrows and magpies built a nest on top of his head. Reeds
grew up between his legs as he sat tranquilly and erect without movement
for six years. At the age of thirty, on the eighth day of the twelfth
month, as the morning star appeared, he was suddenly
enlightened.^[418](#calibre_link-448){#calibre_link-912 .calibre13}^
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1048 .calibre2}

In the [Record of the Hōkyō Era]{.italice} ([宝慶記]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Hōkyō ki]{.italice}), Dōgen recorded his master
Tiantong Rujing's saying about zazen and dropping off body and mind
([身心脫落]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [shinjin
datsuraku]{.italice}):

::: block
The zazen of arhats and pratyekabuddhas is free of attachment, yet it
lacks great compassion. Their zazen is therefore different from the
zazen of the buddhas and ancestors; the zazen of buddhas and ancestors
places primary importance on great compassion and the vow to save all
living beings. . . . In buddhas' and ancestors' zazen, they wish to
gather all Buddhadharma from the time they first arouse bodhi-mind.
Buddhas and ancestors do not forget or abandon living beings in their
zazen; they offer a heart of compassion even to an insect. Buddhas and
ancestors vow to save all living beings and dedicate all the merit of
their practice to all living
beings.^[419](#calibre_link-449){#calibre_link-913 .calibre13}^
:::

The source of both Keizan's description of Shakyamuni's practice at Mt.
Dantaloka and Rujing's statement about compassion in buddhas' and
ancestors' zazen seems to be the [Great Perfection of Wisdom
Treatise]{.italice} (Skt. [Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra]{.italice};
[大智度論]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [Dàzhìdù lùn]{.italice}; Jp.
[Daichido ron]{.italice}), a commentary attributed to Nāgārjuna (fl.
second or third century CE) on the [25,000-line Perfection of Wisdom
Sutra]{.italice} (Skt. [Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā
Sūtra]{.italice}). Right after the statement (as repeated by Rujing
above) that buddhas and ancestors do not forget compassion toward all
living beings, including insects, Nāgārjuna refers to a story about a
mountain sage who was Shakyamuni in one of his past lives. Shakyamuni
was then called Rakei Sennin ([螺髻仙人]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}),
which means "sage with hair like a conch shell." While he was sitting
immovably in an upright posture like a tree, a magpie made a nest on his
head and laid eggs. The sage thought that if he stopped sitting and
moved, the mother bird would be frightened and not return, and the baby
birds would die. Therefore, he continued to sit without moving until the
mother and baby birds flew away.

[]{#calibre_link-1225 .calibre2}

This story emphasizes that the Buddha practiced with all living beings,
including birds and insects, and tried not to frighten or harm them.
Even while he was sitting, he considered living beings part of his life.

A modern commentator, Nanboku Ōba ([大場南北]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}),
has suggested Dōgen wrote this waka when he saw a Buddha statue in an
old shrine hall, probably by the
roadside.^[420](#calibre_link-450){#calibre_link-914 .calibre13}^
Perhaps since the shrine had not been cleaned for a long time, the
statue was covered with dust, and Dōgen found a spider's web on its
face. Then he remembered the story of Rakei Sennin and imagined a magpie
making a nest on the crown of the Buddha's head.

Since waka are short, it is not possible to describe situations in
detail. Readers need to use their imaginations to help interpret such
poems.

At the moment

as they are

[Waga tomo naran]{.italice} means "that which is not my friend," and
[katarai zo naki]{.italice} means "there is no one I talk with." This is
a double negative; its literal translation is "There is no one I talk
with who is not my friend."

In [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} "Genjōkōan," Dōgen says:

::: block
To study the Buddha Way is to study the self. To study the self is to
forget the self. To forget the self is to be verified by all things. To
be verified by all things is to let the body and mind of
[]{#calibre_link-971 .calibre2}the self, and the body and mind of
others, drop off. There is a trace of realization that cannot be
grasped. We endlessly keep expressing this ungraspable trace of
realization.^[421](#calibre_link-451){#calibre_link-915 .calibre13}^
:::

The time of dropping off body and mind of self and others is when we
hear a voice or sound as it is, without our fictitious interpretation
and self-centered judgment. This is when we are released from clinging
to our own five aggregates (material elements, sensations, perceptions,
formations, and consciousness)---that is, our body and mind. Colors and
shapes are seen as they are; sounds and voices are heard as they are.

When we are not released from clinging to the five aggregates, contact
with the objects of our sense organs causes pleasant, unpleasant, or
neutral sensations. According to Buddhist teaching, perceptions form out
of these sensations, and we consequently develop preferences, pursue
what we like and flee from what we do not. This is why we perform
wholesome or unwholesome actions that produce good or bad karma,
eventually making our lives into saṃsāra---we are always chasing after
things we want and trying to escape things we do not want. Our life goes
up and down depending on whether we are successful or not---whether our
desires are satisfied or not. We lose the stable foundation of our
lives.

When we see the emptiness of ourselves and the objects of our sense
organs, we are released from this transmigration. We discover a stable
way of life. Through our eyes, we see the Buddha's Dharma body appear;
through our ears, we hear the Buddha's voice. We discover that
everything we encounter is the Dharma that shows us reality, rather than
a mere object of our greedy desire or hatred.

"Hearing sound as it is" is not some mystical way of hearing, but rather
letting go, moment by moment, of the thoughts and feelings triggered by
our contact with objects. We refrain from making concepts about objects
and taking action based on these concepts.

For example, in autumn we hear the chorus of insects during early
morning and evening zazen. In Japanese poetry, we call such sounds
[]{#calibre_link-1214 .calibre2}[mushi-shigure]{.italice}
([虫時雨]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). [Mushi]{.italice} means "insect,"
and [shigure]{.italice} is "intermittent drizzling rain," particularly
in autumn or early winter. The insects' chorus is like the sound of
rainfall. This reminds me of a short phrase in a traditional Japanese
song that I heard on a radio program many years ago when I was a
student. I only remember the phrase that goes, "[Ware mo mushi naru
mushi shigure]{.italice}"---which means "Within the chorus of insect
sounds, I, too, am an insect." The person hearing the insects singing
feels at one with them.

When we simply hear sounds, we do not feel separation between subject
and object. There is no trace of "I" as a subject, "hearing" as an
activity, or "the sound" as an object. This is intimate hearing before
the separation between listener and sound. We are simply sitting and
insects are just chirping without any interaction---we are living
together as intimate friends within the network of interdependent
origination.

Not only in zazen, but when we meet people, if we hear their voices as
they are, without prejudice or judgments about them---whether they are
good or bad people, friends or enemies---we can see the possibility of
being friends on the grounds of interdependent origination, even if we
have different opinions.

Grass hermitage

beginning of summer

time of changing clothes

only a cool bamboo blind hangs

[]{#calibre_link-1191 .calibre2}

[Io]{.italice} (or [iori]{.italice}) is a "small hermitage," rather than
a temple or monastery. This poem might have been written during Dōgen's
first summer in Echizen province, in 1244. Because the temple
Daibutsu-ji (later renamed Eihei-ji) had not yet been constructed, he
called his simple dwelling a hermitage.

Beginning in the Heian era in Japan (794--1185 CE), people at the
emperor's court changed their wardrobes from winter to summer clothes at
the start of the fourth lunar month. In the Kamakura era (1192--1333
CE), when Dōgen lived, this custom became more widespread. Even today,
in Japanese schools, companies, government offices, and Buddhist
temples, people change to summer clothing on June 1, around the time of
the fourth lunar month.

Today at Sōtō Zen monasteries, in winter a thick curtain is hung at the
entrance to the monks' hall to conserve heat. In June, the curtain is
changed to a bamboo blind, allowing cool breezes in. There are many
other such changes the monks make to live comfortably during the hot and
humid summers.

In his small hermitage, Dōgen simply hung a bamboo blind so fresh air
could enter. This final line suggests little separation between inside
and outside.

No form

to show as my mind

only dew-frost

forms

[]{#calibre_link-1220 .calibre2}

[Kokoro]{.italice} ([心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) is "mind."
[Iro]{.italice} ([色]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) is "color," but as
discussed in waka number eight, the same character can also mean "form."
It is therefore also possible to translate these lines as "There is no
color to show people as my mind." [Tsuyu]{.italice} is "dew," and
[shimo]{.italice} is "frost." Usually these are interpreted as two
different things: dew is made up of water droplets condensed on a
surface when the temperature falls below the dew point, usually in late
summer through autumn, while frost forms when the temperature drops
below freezing in late autumn and winter.

However, Keizan Jōkin ([瑩山紹瑾]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};1268--1325
CE), the fourth-generation descendant of Dōgen and founder of Sōji-ji
([總持寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), thought in this case
[tsuyushimo]{.italice} was one word (dew-frost). He quoted this waka by
Dōgen in the Dharma words ([法語]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[hōgo]{.italice}) he wrote to his patron, Myōjō ([妙淨]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}). Keizan said, "At the end of autumn or the beginning of
winter, we see [tsuyushimo]{.italice}, which is neither dew nor
frost."^[422](#calibre_link-452){#calibre_link-916 .calibre13}^ The only
thing formed is something between forms.

Depending on the subtle differences in temperature during the transition
from autumn to winter, water on a leaf becomes dew, frost, or frozen dew
(white dew). If the temperature falls to freezing after dewdrops are
formed, they become frozen dew, which is not crystallized like frost.
Here are three similar yet distinct phenomena: autumn/winter, dew/frost,
and halfway between them. The moment is neither autumn nor winter, and
we see something that is neither exactly dew nor frost. By what name
should we call this moment and phenomenon?

Dōgen Zenji says in [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} [zuimonki]{.italice}:

::: block
Originally, the human mind is neither good nor evil. Good and evil arise
depending on conditions. For example, when people arouse the mind of
awakening and enter a mountain forest, they think that a dwelling in the
woods is good and the human world is bad. And when their aspiration has
waned and they leave the mountain forest, they think the mountain forest
is bad. This is because the human mind has no fixed characteristics; it
changes in this way or that, influenced by circumstances.
[]{#calibre_link-1050 .calibre2}Consequently, if we encounter good
conditions, the mind becomes good. If bad conditions draw near, the mind
becomes bad. Do not think that the mind is fundamentally evil. We should
simply follow good
circumstances.^[423](#calibre_link-453){#calibre_link-917 .calibre13}^
:::

Because our minds have no fixed form but depend on our surroundings,
Dōgen Zenji encourages his students to befriend good people, listen to
them, and do good with them. Then our minds are influenced by them and
become good. It is like walking in the mist; our clothing gets wet
little by little without our noticing. Kōdo Sawaki Rōshi, my teacher's
teacher, said we have both Buddha-nature and thief-nature. When we are
beginner bodhisattvas, even though we have aroused the mind of awakening
and taken the bodhisattva vows and precepts, our mind is not yet stable.
Depending upon the situation, our mind may become frozen, and we may
take actions expressing our thief-nature. However, when conditions
change, our mind thaws and becomes flexible, open, and warm. It is
important for us to try to put ourselves in good circumstances and with
good people.

If someone asked me,

What is Buddha?

I'd say there's ice

under the [kaiya]{.italice}

The first half of this waka is not difficult at all. This is a simple
question asking what Buddha is. But the answer to this question is
difficult to understand because it is not clear what [kaiya]{.italice}
refers to. []{#calibre_link-1222 .calibre2}It is said this is an old
word from the time of the [Man'yōshū]{.italice} ([万葉集]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}, literally [Collection of]{.italice} [Ten Thousand
Leaves]{.italice}), the oldest collection of waka poems that was
compiled in the eighth century. According to traditional commentaries,
[ya]{.italice} means "roof" ([屋]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) or a
structure like a hut or shack, but there are three possible meanings for
the entire word: deer fire hut ([鹿火屋]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}),
mosquito fire hut ([蚊火屋]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), and silkworm hut
([蚕屋]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). The first possible meaning is a hut
used to make a fire at night to chase deer away in order to protect
vegetables or grains. The second possibility refers to the fact that
mosquitoes and other insects will come to a fire, as in a proverb that
says, "Of their own accord, summer insects fly to their death in the
flame." And the third possibility is that the word refers to a silkworm
hut which needs to be kept warm with fires built by silkworm farmers.

Dōgen Zenji wrote a fascicle in the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} called "The
King Seeks [Saindhava]{.italice}" ([王索仙陀婆]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Ō saku sendaba"). For us, [kaiya]{.italice} is like
this Sanskrit word [saindhava]{.italice}, which has four different
meanings: water, salt, cup, and horse. The fascicle is about the story
of a servant who needed to figure out exactly what his king was asking
for, depending on the context. If the king asked for
[saindhava]{.italice} when he wanted to wash his face, the servant gave
him some water. If the king asked during a meal, the servant gave him
salt. After eating, the servant offered a cup to drink from. When the
king wanted to go out, the servant brought a horse. The wise servant
knew what the word meant depending on what the king was doing at that
moment. However, we do not know what [kaiya]{.italice} meant, because we
do not know what Dōgen was seeing or thinking when he wrote this waka.
So we need to guess.

In modern Japanese, [tsurara]{.italice} refers to an icicle, but
according to a dictionary of Japanese archaisms, in Classical Japanese
before the Tokugawa period (1603--1868 CE), an icicle was called
[taruhi]{.italice} ([垂氷]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; literally "hanging
ice"), while [tsurara]{.italice} referred to ice in general. However, I
do not understand how ice could form underneath a hut or shack the way
it is presented here.

In this waka there are two opposites that cannot exist together: fire
and ice. The traditional commentaries interpreted this as showing the
[]{#calibre_link-967 .calibre2}interpenetration of [ji]{.italice}
([事]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) and [ri]{.italice} ([理]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), or [hen]{.italice} ([偏]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) and
[sh]{.italice}[ō]{.italice} ([正]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), which refer
to absolute and conventional reality, or principle and phenomenon. The
commentaries quote a saying by Master Caoshan Benji ([曹]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}[山本寂]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Sōzan Honjaku;
840--901 CE): "Within fire, cold ice is formed ([燄裡寒氷結]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"})." This expression is part of Caoshan's verses on the five
ranks ([五位]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [go]{.italice}
[i]{.italice}).

A contemporary commentator, Akio Matsumoto ([松本章男]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), who is not a Zen practitioner or scholar of Buddhism but
an expert in Japanese literature, compared this waka to one composed by
Fujiwara no Kinzane ([藤原公実]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1043--1107 CE)
from the collection of waka [One Hundred Poems from the Era of Emperor
Horikawa]{.italice} ([堀河百首]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Horikawa
hyakush]{.italice}[ū]{.italice}). The waka from that collection contains
almost the same expression: "Ice is formed / even underneath the
[kaiya]{.italice}" ([かひ屋がしたも／氷しにけり]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; [kaiya ga shita mo / koori
shinikeri]{.italice}).^[424](#calibre_link-454){#calibre_link-918
.calibre13}^ According to Matsumoto, [kaiya]{.italice} here is a device
for catching fish, a bundle of twigs put underwater. Small fish would
get caught among the twigs, and people then lifted the bundle out to get
the fish. In winter, a roof was put above the trap to prevent the
surface of the water from freezing. This roof was called a
[kaiya]{.italice} ([飼屋]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). In his waka,
Kinzane described the scenery of an exceptionally cold winter day where
even the water underneath the [kaiya]{.italice} was frozen and people
could not catch any fish.

I prefer this interpretation over the traditional one. In his waka, when
Dōgen describes the scenery of seasons, he rarely refers to phenomena we
cannot see. Ice within fire is something we do not actually see in the
phenomenal world. If we accept the traditional interpretation, the waka
becomes an expression of a philosophical idea: the interpenetration of
opposites. However, I have not found that Dōgen uses such ideas in his
waka poems. His expressions of nature are always simply sketches of what
he sees.

What does this waka mean if we adopt the second interpretation? A
[kaiya]{.italice} is a device invented by human beings to catch fish.
However, it is too cold in this waka to fish. A human-made device
doesn't work when conditions are different from expectations. I think
Dōgen is saying Buddhadharma is something beyond anything that human
[]{#calibre_link-1203 .calibre2}beings can hold onto with their thinking
minds. In the essay "Universal Recommendation of Zazen"
([普勧坐禅儀]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Fukanzazengi") Dōgen says,
"In doing zazen, the kōan manifests itself; it cannot be ensnared." In
this case, "kōan" refers to the reality beyond human thinking. "Cannot
be ensnared" literally means that there is no way to catch or cage it to
make it our possession. When there is ice beneath the [kaiya]{.italice},
it too cannot ensnare anything.

The Buddhadharma is something beyond our human ability to grasp because
we are merely a tiny part of it. Dōgen liked the expression, "Only
Buddha together with Buddha" ([唯佛與佛]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[yuibutsu yobutsu]{.italice}) from the second chapter of the [Lotus
Sutra]{.italice}. This means we have to open our hands of human thinking
and just let go. Then the Buddha beyond thought is revealed.

People of this world

are like the elephant fleeing through a window

its tail remains despite nothing holding it

such small things become obstacles

to renouncing the mundane world

An elephant escaping through a window is an unusual image. Menzan
changed "elephant" ([象]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [kisa]{.italice})
to "water buffalo" ([牛]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [ushi]{.italice})
and added the title "A Water Buffalo Passes through a Window" to this
waka, as if Dōgen Zenji were composing this poem as a commentary on case
number thirty-eight of the [Gateless Barrier]{.italice} (Ch.
[無門關]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}, [Wúménguān]{.italice}; Jp.
[無門関]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}, [Mumonkan]{.italice}). The [Gateless
Barrier]{.italice} was compiled in 1228, the year after Dōgen returned
to Japan from China. []{#calibre_link-1211 .calibre2}Shinchi Kakushin
([心地覚心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1207--1298 CE), a Rinzai Zen
master who received the bodhisattva precepts from Dōgen, later went to
China and received [inka]{.italice} from Wumen Huikai
([無門慧開]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Mumon Ekai; 1183--1260 CE),
the compiler of the [Gateless]{.italice}
[Barrier]{.italice}.^[425](#calibre_link-455){#calibre_link-919
.calibre13}^ Kakushin returned in 1254 and introduced the [Gateless
Barrier]{.italice} to Japan. Dōgen had passed away the previous year, so
he probably did not have the chance to read the [Gateless
Barrier]{.italice}.

According to the [Gateless Barrier]{.italice}, this kōan ("A Water
Buffalo Passes through a Window") was the saying of the Song dynasty
Rinzai Master Wuzu Fayan ([五祖法演]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Goso
Hōen; 1024--1104 CE), so Dōgen might have been familiar with it.
However, he never mentioned the kōan in his writings or included it in
the collection of three hundred kōans in the [Shinji
Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} ([真字正法眼蔵]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). In all
of the older manuscripts of Dōgen's waka that were made prior to
Menzan's version, the animal in this waka is an elephant, not a water
buffalo. Menzan also changed "obstacle" ([障り]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [sawari]{.italice}) to "mind" ([心]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [kokoro]{.italice}). As a result, the meaning of the
poem was completely changed from Dōgen's original.

The eminent modern Rinzai Zen Master Zenkei Shibayama
([柴山全慶]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1894--1974) said in his comments
on case number thirty-eight of the [Gateless Barrier]{.italice}: "This
tail is nothing else than the formless form of
reality."^[426](#calibre_link-456){#calibre_link-920 .calibre13}^
Shibayama Rōshi also quotes this waka by Dōgen Zenji, albeit the version
found in Menzan's compilation. The translation of the waka as quoted in
his Dharma talk is as follows:

This world is but the tail of a buffalo passing through a window.

The tail is the mind,

which knows neither passing nor
not-passing.^[427](#calibre_link-457){#calibre_link-921 .calibre13}^

The last line is Shibayama Rōshi's addition to make the meaning of
"mind" clear. It seems to me that Menzan revised Dōgen Zenji's waka to
make it compatible with the Rinzai interpretation of case number
thirty-eight of the [Gateless]{.italice} [Barrier]{.italice}.
Traditional commentaries []{#calibre_link-997 .calibre2}in the Sōtō Zen
tradition have also been based on Menzan's revised version of this waka.
This is only one example of how, until the second half of the twentieth
century, the understanding of Dōgen Zenji's teachings were filtered
through the interpretations of Tokugawa-period Sōtō Zen masters like
Menzan.

There is, however, a tale of an elephant passing through a window that
appears in a sutra titled [The Story of the Ordination of
Anāthapiṇḍada]{.italice}['s Daughter]{.italice}
([佛説給孤長者女得度因縁經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Bussetsu
gyūkochōja jō tokudo innen]{.italice}
[kyō]{.italice}).^[428](#calibre_link-458){#calibre_link-922
.calibre13}^ The story is about a king who lived in the time of Kāśyapa
Buddha, the sixth of the seven past buddhas. The king had ten unusual
dreams and asked Kāśyapa Buddha about their meaning. In the first dream,
an elephant tried to escape a room by passing through a window, and
although its body got through, it could not escape because its tail was
somehow stuck in the room, even though nothing was holding it. Kāśyapa
Buddha said this dream was about a time in the future, after Shakyamuni
Buddha had passed away, when some monks, despite having left home, would
still have minds influenced by greedy attachments to fame and profit
that made them unable to attain liberation.

In this waka, Dōgen means to say many people of his time who had left
home to become monks could not fully escape saṃsāra due to their
attachments to money and status.

In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Sounds of Valley Streams, Colors
of Mountains" ([谿聲山色]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Keisei
sanshoku"), Dōgen says:

::: block
Moreover, we should not forget the aspiration we aroused when we first
sought the Buddha Way. What I want to say is that when we first aroused
the mind of awakening, we . . . abandoned fame and profit . . . \[and\]
we simply aspired to attain the Way. We never expected to be venerated
or receive offerings from the king and ministers. . . . We did not
expect to be involved in entanglements with human and heavenly affairs.
And yet foolish people, even if they have aroused the mind of awakening,
soon forget their original aspiration and mistakenly
[]{#calibre_link-1161 .calibre2}expect offerings from human and heavenly
beings. And when they receive them, they are delighted, thinking the
virtue of the Buddhadharma has been realized. When kings and ministers
come frequently to take refuge, foolish practitioners think this is the
manifestation of their own \[virtue of the\] Way. This is one of the
demons afflicting the practice of the Way. Even though we should not
forget to have a compassionate mind towards kings and ministers, we
should not be delighted when such people venerate
us.^[429](#calibre_link-459){#calibre_link-923 .calibre13}^
:::

In this waka, Dōgen uses the story of the elephant's tail from [The
Story of the Ordination]{.italice} [of Anāthapiṇḍada's
Daughter]{.italice} to criticize many of the Japanese Buddhist monks of
his time. In [Shōbōgenzō zuimonki]{.italice}, he said something similar
to what he wrote in "Sounds of Valley Streams, Colors of Mountains," for
example, in section 6-21:

::: block
Even though it seems that some people of the world today have renounced
the world and left their homes, if we examine their conduct, there are
also those who are not yet true home-leavers. Those who are called
home-leavers must first of all give up the \[ego-centered\] self as well
as fame and profit. Unless we become free from these, even if we
practice the Way as if extinguishing a fire enveloping our heads, or
zealously cut off our hands or legs, it would only be a meaningless
hardship that has nothing to do with
renunciation.^[430](#calibre_link-460){#calibre_link-924 .calibre13}^
:::

This was not solely a problem for Indian monks after Shakyamuni's death
or Japanese monks in Dōgen's time. In the United States today, Buddhist
institutions are not as large as they were in India or medieval Japan,
so I do not think people can easily become Buddhist monks/priests for
the sake of fame and profit. Still, we may make similar mistakes on a
smaller scale in our practice. For example, when we compete with others
and want to consider ourselves better than them, or when we want others
to view us as superior practitioners, []{#calibre_link-1192 .calibre2}or
if we study Buddhist teachings to show others that we have knowledge,
our motivation is not the genuine mind of awakening. In those cases we
are motivated by our ego-centered desire to win an imaginary
competition. This is the way we create saṃsāra within our Buddhist
practice. This is the tiny tail of the elephant that binds us to
saṃsāra.

Dewdrops on blades of grass

waiting for the morning sunrise

exist only a moment

Autumn wind in the field,

don't hurry!

A dewdrop is beautiful and yet lasts for only a short time. Japanese
expressions such as "a dewdrop as beautiful as a jewel"
([露珠]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [roshu]{.italice}) and "dewdrops
shining in sunlight like flowers" ([露華]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[roka]{.italice}) show an appreciation for the dewdrop's fleeting
beauty. Our lives, which are precious but without an abiding
self-nature, are compared to dewdrops in the expression "dewdrop-like
life" ([露命]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [romei]{.italice}). Dōgen
Zenji used this expression often; for example in "Universal
Recommendation of Zazen" ([普勧坐禅儀]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
"Fukanzazengi") he says: "Furthermore, your body is like a drop of dew
on a blade of grass; your life is like a flash of lightning. Your body
will soon disappear; your life will be lost in an
instant."^[431](#calibre_link-461){#calibre_link-925 .calibre13}^

While I was living at Valley Zendo in western Massachusetts, I worked
harvesting blueberries a few weeks each summer for several years. In the
early mornings, the blueberry field was so beautiful. Each blueberry and
each leaf were covered with dewdrops. []{#calibre_link-1205 .calibre2}In
the morning sun, the many acres of the blueberry field looked like a
carpet of bright jewels. However, soon the sun rose higher, the plants
warmed, and the dewdrops disappeared.

In this waka, Dōgen describes dewdrops on a blade of grass during an
early autumn morning. The dewdrops remain only until the sun rises. When
the cold autumn wind blows, even the grass on which the dewdrops rest
will wither. Seeing this scenery of changing seasons, we human beings
feel melancholy and have some sympathy or even compassion for the
dewdrops and the grass. We see that our lives are the same. Sooner or
later we will all disappear, but we do not know when.

However, for Dōgen this is not a pessimistic view of life. He sees
beauty and dignity in impermanence. As Dōgen wrote in
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} "Genjōkōan," each and every dewdrop reflects the
boundless moonlight. Eternity lives within impermanence. He also writes
in [Instructions for]{.italice} [the Cook]{.italice}
([典座教訓]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Tenzo kyōkun]{.italice}):
"Although drawn by the voices of spring, do not wander over spring
meadows; viewing the fall colors, do not allow your heart to
fall."^[432](#calibre_link-462){#calibre_link-926 .calibre13}^

We see that spring will come again, and plants, flowers, insects, birds,
and all living beings will renew their activity. We do not need to be
overwhelmed by the cold autumn winds in our lives.

Even insentient beings

such as grasses and trees

wither today;

seeing this in front of our eyes,

how can we not grieve?

[]{#calibre_link-1179 .calibre2}

In his Dharma talk on this waka, Kōdō Sawaki Rōshi emphasized the
quality of our eyes---whether they are open to seeing impermanence and
feeling grief about the plants' and our own lives. He compared himself
with Dōgen Zenji, who deeply realized impermanence by experiencing his
mother's death when he was seven years old. Seeing the incense smoke at
his mother's funeral, Dōgen aspired to become a Buddhist monk. Sawaki
Rōshi's mother died when he was five; his father died when he was seven.
He was adopted by his aunt, but before long her husband died of a stroke
right in front of Sawaki Rōshi. Although he had such painful early
experiences, Sawaki Roshi said he did not really see impermanence;
rather, he only worried about who would feed and raise him.

His next adoptive father, Bunkichi Sawaki, was a gambler living in a
red-light district. When Sawaki Rōshi was eight, a middle-aged man died
of a stroke in a prostitute's room nearby. Sawaki Rōshi saw the dead man
in bed, with his wife beside him, crying, "Why did you die in a place
like this, of all places?" Witnessing this miserable scene, Sawaki Rōshi
was stunned, and this time impermanence and the impossibility of keeping
secrets were inscribed deeply in his
mind.^[433](#calibre_link-463){#calibre_link-927 .calibre13}^ Sawaki
Rōshi later said, "Dōgen Zenji was sharp-witted, so he could deeply see
impermanence and arouse the mind of awakening by simply seeing the smoke
of incense, or withering trees and grasses, but a dull-witted person
like me could not feel the same thing until I had much more intense
experiences."^[434](#calibre_link-464){#calibre_link-928 .calibre13}^
Even though Sawaki Rōshi said he was dull-witted compared to Dōgen
Zenji, I think he was probably the only person among many at the brothel
who had the eyes to see the spiritual meaning of impermanence at that
event.

After Sawaki Rōshi became a well-known Zen master, he was invited to
give a talk for a group of priests near his hometown. He talked about
his experience of realizing impermanence when he was eight. One of the
priests in the audience remembered that a member of one of his temple's
families had died like that several decades before. He recalled that the
strict abbot of the temple at that time was furious about how the man
had died, and as a result he refused to give []{#calibre_link-1088
.calibre2}him a Dharma name at his
funeral.^[435](#calibre_link-465){#calibre_link-929 .calibre13}^ When
Sawaki Rōshi heard this, he wrote to the current abbot of the temple
that the man who died was a great teacher for him, who saved him and
made him a monk, and he asked the priest to give the dead man a Dharma
name.

All plants know when to sprout, grow, bloom, bear fruit, and wither.
Each plant has its own time and season. If we are mindful, we see that
everything in nature expresses the Dharma of impermanence. Particularly
when we see plants wither, if our eyes are open, we cannot help but
realize the transience of our own lives. Perceiving impermanence and
grieving for it is an opportunity to arouse the mind of awakening. It is
important to note that this view of impermanence is fundamentally
different from the ordinary sense of the fragility of life expressed by
many Japanese poets. For example, the basic theme of the famous story
[Tale of the]{.italice} [Heike]{.italice} ([平家物語]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}, Jp. [Heike monogatari]{.italice}) is impermanence. The
story begins: "The sound of the Gion Shoja bells echoes the impermanence
of all things; the color of the sala flowers reveals the truth that the
prosperous must decline. The proud do not endure, they are like a dream
on a spring night; the mighty fall at last, they are as dust before the
wind."^[436](#calibre_link-466){#calibre_link-930 .calibre13}^

"Gion Shōja" ([祇園精舍]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) refers to Jetavana
monastery in India where Shakyamuni practiced, and the [sala]{.italice}
flowers refer to the tree in Kuśinagara where Shakyamuni passed away. It
is said that when Shakyamuni died, the [sala]{.italice} trees bore full
blossoms out of season, but these flowers faded quickly, symbolizing
both gratitude and sadness for the Buddha. As students, many Japanese
memorize this beautiful passage from Heike and later quote it when they
speak of impermanence. This saying expresses feelings of futility, fear
of change, and pessimistic resignation.

However, impermanence is not negative in Buddhism. In the
[Sutra]{.italice} [on the Teachings Bequeathed by the Buddha]{.italice}
([佛遺教經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [Fóyíjiào]{.italice}
[jīng]{.italice}; Jp. [Butsuyuikyō gyō]{.italice}), Shakyamuni said:

::: block
All of you Bhikshus! Do not be grieved or distressed. If I were to live
in the world for an eon, my association with you would
[]{#calibre_link-1042 .calibre2}still come to an end. A meeting without
a separation can never be. The Dharma for benefitting oneself and others
is complete. If I were to live longer it would be of no further benefit.
All of those who could be crossed over, whether in the heavens above or
among humans, have already crossed over, and all of those who have not
yet crossed over have already created the causes and conditions for
crossing over. . . . Meetings necessarily have separations, so do not
harbor grief. Every appearance in the world is like this; be vigorous,
seek liberation right away! Destroy the darkness of delusion with the
brightness of wisdom.^[437](#calibre_link-467){#calibre_link-931
.calibre13}^
:::

Although the Buddha encourages his followers not to mourn, sadness about
impermanence is not considered negative in Buddhism. Awakening to the
truth of suffering, the first of the four noble truths, is the starting
point of Buddhist study and practice. It is our opportunity to practice
what the Buddha taught.

Seeing the reality that lies beyond our self-centered desires and
expectations, we understand how our lives are connected with all beings.
In case number twenty-seven of the [Blue Cliff Record]{.italice}, a monk
asks Yunmen Wenyan ([雲門文偃]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Unmon
Bun'en; 864--949 CE), "How is it when the tree withers and the leaves
fall?" Yunmen answers, "Body exposed in the golden
wind."^[438](#calibre_link-468){#calibre_link-932 .calibre13}^ The
"golden wind" can be interpreted as the Buddhadharma, so this suggests
that impermanence is not a negative, but rather it has something to
teach us about the true nature of reality.

[]{#calibre_link-1052 .calibre2}

Although it snows ceaselessly

at the gate of the mountain valley

the warbler is singing

"Spring has already come"

This poem is about early spring at Eihei-ji, when it is still cold,
gloomy, and snowy. After a long winter, people yearn for spring.
Suddenly a warbler begins to sing, announcing that spring has arrived.
This tiny bird is the only sign of spring in the world. Yet within the
scenery of winter, spring is already here.

Sawaki Rōshi interpreted this poem as a metaphor for Dōgen Zenji's
teaching of the unity of practice and realization, saṃsāra and nirvana.
Within winter, spring already exists. Within spring, winter remains.
Winter and spring permeate each other. This is how we practice as
bodhisattvas. Even when we arouse the mind of awakening and practice the
Buddhadharma, we are still ordinary human beings with egocentricity and
delusions. Still, in our practice of the Buddha's teachings, the Dharma
body of the Buddha manifests itself. Our practice here and now is the
warbler's singing.

Another sign of spring amid winter is plum blossoms. In his Dharma
discourse on the full moon of the first lunar month in 1247, Dōgen
composed a Chinese poem:

The family style is pure white like plum blossoms, snow, and the moon.

At the time of flowering, fortunately there is a way to protect the
body.

The clouds are bright, the water is delightful, and our effort is
totally perfect.

Without realizing it, our entire body enters the emperor's
capital.^[439](#calibre_link-469){#calibre_link-933 .calibre13}^

As I mentioned in the commentary on waka number twelve, New Year's Day
is the beginning of spring. In Echizen province, []{#calibre_link-1081
.calibre2}although it is actually the coldest time of year and
everything is covered with snow, it is already spring. Yet the only
visible sign of spring is plum blossoms. Dōgen's family style of
practice is pure and undefiled, like the plum blossoms and snow
illuminated by the full moon. The way to protect our body is to practice
zazen. In sitting and letting go of thoughts, we are one with the plum
blossoms, the snow, and the moonlight. The "clouds" and "water" refer to
the assembly monks ([雲水]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[unsui]{.italice}). The monks are refreshed with the coming of the New
Year. In their continuous day-to-day practice, nothing is lacking. The
"emperor's capital" refers to Chang'an ([長安]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
in English literally "eternal peace"); like in waka number eleven, this
refers to nirvana.

With this mind

I adorn the heavenly sky

with flowers

respectfully offering them to all buddhas

in the three times

"I adorn the heavenly sky with flowers" refers to a story in the Vinaya
of a bodhisattva in one of Shakyamuni Buddha's past lives. When
Dīpaṃkara Buddha lived in this world, there was a bodhisattva (the
future Shakyamuni Buddha) who lived as a hermit. When he heard that
Dīpaṃkara Buddha was coming, he wanted to offer flowers to him. He
bought five stalks of lotus, spending all the money he had. When he
threw the flowers to the Buddha as an offering, they stayed in the sky
and were transformed into a flower canopy that covered the Buddha
wherever he went.

[]{#calibre_link-1049 .calibre2}

In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Arousing the Unsurpassable Mind"
([發無上心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Hotsu mujōshin") Dōgen refers
to this offering of five stalks of lotus flowers:

::: block
Taking it up like this, "sitting as a buddha" and "making a buddha" are
called "bringing forth the mind." Generally speaking, in the cases of
\[those\] bringing forth the mind of bodhi, rather than taking up the
mind of bodhi from elsewhere, they bring forth the mind by taking up the
mind of bodhi \[itself\]. To "take up the mind" means to take up "one
blade of grass" and construct a buddha, to take up "a tree without
roots" and construct a sūtra. It is to offer sand to a buddha, to offer
slop to a buddha. It is to provide one ball of food to a living being,
to offer five flowers to a
tathāgata.^[440](#calibre_link-470){#calibre_link-934 .calibre13}^
:::

In the waka, the Japanese text simply reads "mind" ([心]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [kokoro]{.italice}) instead of "bodhi-mind," the mind
of awakening. However, it is clear from the context that this is what
Dōgen is thinking. As bodhisattvas, people who have aroused the mind of
awakening, we exchange all our personal possessions for the lotus
flowers (Dharma) and throw them into the sky ([空]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}, which also means "emptiness") as an offering to the
Buddha. Our offerings remain in the sky as ornaments of the world of the
Buddhadharma. They do not fall back to earth, the ground of human
desire.

Inspired by this waka, Ryōkan ([良寛]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
1758--1831 CE) composed his own:

In my begging bowl

violets and dandelions

to all buddhas in the three times

While Ryōkan was begging ([托鉢]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[takuhatsu]{.italice}) on a spring day, some children in the village
wanted to play with him, as was usually the case. Ryōkan started to pick
violets and dandelions in the spring field with the children. He put the
flowers in his begging bowl and told the children, "Let's offer these
pretty flowers to the buddhas."

Possibly on the same occasion, Ryōkan composed another waka:

I spent the whole day

picking violets

A begging bowl is made for receiving offerings from people, but Ryōkan
used it to make an offering to the buddhas. His practices of begging and
playing with the children were also his offerings.

Having left the leaves of grass,

arriving at Konobeyama Mountain

I felt I was walking in the clouds

In the first lunar month of 1253, Dōgen Zenji wrote a fascicle of the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} called "Eight Aspects of the Awakening of Great
Beings" ([八大人覺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Hachi dainin gaku").
This was the final year of Dōgen's life. Most of this fascicle is a
quotation from the [Sutra on the Teachings Bequeathed by the
Buddha]{.italice} ([佛遺教經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [Fóyíjiào
jīng]{.italice}; Jp. [Butsuyuikyō gyō]{.italice}), but Dōgen wrote very
short comments before and after. It seems that by this time he knew he
was dying. His successor, Ejō, observed in the afterword that this
teaching on awakening was both Shakyamuni Buddha's and Dōgen Zenji's
will for their descendants.

Dōgen's supporters asked him to go to Kyoto for medical treatment. In
September, while the grasses were still thriving, he left Eihei-ji. This
poem is about his journey from there to Kyoto. The trip must have been
extremely hard on his body. Not far from Eihei-ji is a steep mountain
named Konobeyama (or Konomeyama). The peak of this mountain pass
separated Echizen province from Wakasa province. There he rested. He
probably knew this was his last chance to see the mountains of Echizen
province, but the peak was covered in misty clouds.
[]{#calibre_link-1184 .calibre2}Here, the clouds symbolize the emptiness
in which he traveled with his sick body.

I wasn't sure if I could expect to see autumn again

gratefully I view tonight's full moon

How is it possible to sleep?

About ten days after arriving in Kyoto, Dōgen saw the beautiful full
moon. According to the East Asian lunar calendar, the fifteenth day of
the eighth lunar month is mid-autumn, which falls around the September
equinox. In most East Asian countries, including Japan, people celebrate
the mid-autumn harvest moon festival (Ch. [中秋節]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; [zhōngqiū jié]{.italice}; Jp. [月見]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; [tsukimi]{.italice}).

At Eihei-ji, Dōgen usually gave a formal Dharma discourse on this day
each year. He also gathered with his disciples to compose Chinese poems.
The following is one such example found in [Dōgen's Extensive
Record]{.italice} ([永平広録]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Eihei
kōroku]{.italice}):

Although golden waves are not calm,

The moon lodges in the river.

[]{#calibre_link-1173 .calibre2}

In refreshing air it shines on high, and all the ground is autumn.

Reed flowers on the Wei River, snow on Song Peak,

Who would resent the endlessness of the long
night?^[442](#calibre_link-472){#calibre_link-936 .calibre13}^

In his final year, Dōgen was not sure he would live until autumn, so he
was delighted to see the full moon in Kyoto, where he was born and
raised. He did not want to waste the beautiful sight by sleeping.

The moon was a symbol he often used, like the image of the moon in the
dewdrop in "Genjōkōan." He wrote an entire fascicle of
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} titled "Moon" ([都機]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. "Tsuki"). In another waka (see addendum ten below) he wrote that
this world is like a dewdrop splashed from a waterfowl's beak, staying
in the air for only a few seconds, and yet reflecting boundless
moonlight within this single drop, which shines like the entire moon
itself.

Dōgen passed away on the twenty-eighth day of the eighth lunar month in
1253. His death poem translated from Chinese is recorded in the [Record
of Kenzei]{.italice} as follows:

For fifty-four years

having illuminated the highest heaven

now leaping beyond

breaking through the great thousand worlds

Ha!

with the entire body, without seeking anything

still alive

I jump into the Yellow Spring^[443](#calibre_link-473){#calibre_link-937
.calibre13}^

In Chinese, "Yellow Spring" ([黄泉]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
Huángquán; Jp. Yomi) refers to an underground world where people go
after death. It is similar to the underworld from Greek mythology.

In the above, I have respectfully copied a number of waka poems by the
Great Master, the Founder of Eihei-ji \[Dōgen Zenji\], and humbly offer
them to Teikō Shuso Zenji. From the bottom of my heart, I wish that the
Sōtō school will greatly thrive and our lineage will widely pervade.

The first day of the sixth month in the twenty-seventh year of Oei
(1420),

The eighth abbot of Hōkyō-ji, the monk of Tōun-ji, Kishun
(stamp)^[445](#calibre_link-475){#calibre_link-939 .calibre13}^

This is the postscript to the collection of Dōgen's waka poems by the
monk Kishun ([喜舜]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; n.d.), the eighth abbot of
Hōkyō-ji ([宝慶寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), who later lived at Tōun-ji
([洞雲寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). Teikō Shuso Zenji refers to the
thirteenth abbot of Eihei-ji, Kenkō ([建綱]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
1413--1469 CE). Ostensibly, Kishun copied these waka poems of Dōgen's
and offered them to Kenkō in 1420, but as I noted in my introduction,
there must be some confusion about the year or person. In 1420, Kenkō
was only seven years old. Perhaps the name Teikō Shuso Zenji refers to
someone else.

I won't stop

by the Kamo River

so my appearance isn't reflected there

because I assume

the water will flow to the capital

I have difficulty understanding why Dōgen would have written this waka.
It is the first of the thirteen additional waka in the Shunjusha text,
and one of two waka that first appeared in a manuscript found at the
temple Ryūgen-ji ([龍源寺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}). It was produced at
some point after the [Record of Kenzei]{.italice} and contains only
waka, but its exact date of composition and the sources it used are
unknown. In this poem, Dōgen says he does not want his face reflected in
the river because---depending on the interpretation---the water will
either go into the capital city (Kyoto), or it already came from there.
Bunji Takahashi ([高橋文二]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), the scholar of
Japanese literature who translated the waka into modern Japanese in the
Shunjusha text, interprets [miyako ni]{.italice} [izuru]{.italice} as
"came out of the capital."^[447](#calibre_link-477){#calibre_link-941
.calibre13}^ Takahashi thought this poem was written while Dōgen was
living at Kōshō-ji in Fukakusa, which is south of Kyoto. However, I do
not think that is the case.

If this waka was indeed written by Dōgen, I assume Dōgen composed it
shortly after his ordination, when he was thirteen years old and living
on Mt. Hiei. This mountain is located northeast of Kyoto. If my guess is
correct, this phrase should be translated as "will flow into the
capital." The Kamo River flows from the northwest of Kyoto and merges
with the Takano River from the northeast. Then the river flows south
through the city of Kyoto and eventually to Osaka Bay. If Dōgen lived
north of the city on Mt. Hiei, the water flowed into the capital; if he
lived at Kōshō-ji in Fukakusa, the water flowed out of the capital.

[]{#calibre_link-1185 .calibre2}

I do not believe Dōgen would have had such a negative feeling about
Kyoto while living at Kōshō-ji that he did not even want his face
reflected in the river because it was defiled by people in the capital.
In volume eight of [Dōgen's Extensive Record]{.italice}
([永平広録]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Eihei kōroku]{.italice}),
Dōgen wrote:

::: block
However, I do not yearn for mountains and forests, and do not depart
from the neighborhoods of people. Lotus flowers blossom within the red
furnace; above the blue sky there is a white elm. . . . Don't you see
that the morning marketplace and battlefield are the original place of
awakening for complete penetration of freedom? Why aren't taverns and
houses of prostitution the classroom of naturally real tathagata? This
is exactly the significance of the ancient wise one \[Sakyamuni\]
departing from Bodhgaya, and previous worthies traveling to
Chang'an.^[448](#calibre_link-478){#calibre_link-942 .calibre13}^
:::

I believe this is what Dōgen thought when he established his first
monastery, Kōshō-ji, in the southern suburbs of Kyoto. He did not look
down on the capital and the people who lived there. Rather he wanted to
practice with people in saṃsāra. Probably he had some hope that if he
offered genuine Dharma and its practice to the people of Kyoto, he would
be accepted and supported. Unfortunately, he later became disillusioned
and moved to Echizen province.

If this poem was really written by Dōgen, he was probably expressing his
determination to renounce his aristocratic family and the mundane world
and devote himself to studying and practicing the Buddhadharma as a
young monk on Mt. Hiei. From my own experience, I understand how Dōgen
could have had such an immature but nonetheless pure resolution upon
leaving home. I do not believe, however, that Dōgen would have continued
to harbor such discrimination against worldly people after he came back
from China and began trying to transmit the Dharma to Japan.

This waka is also included only in the Ryūgen-ji manuscript, and its
source is unknown. An almost identical poem (waka number 638) is in a
collection of Ryōkan's waka compiled by Toyoharu Tōgō
([東郷豊治]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), published by Tokyo Sōgensha in
1959. This poem is widely known as Ryōkan's and is included in [Great

Go ahead, plant the seed!

There isn't a village

Where flowers won't grow

The very notion of being "lowborn"

only comes from people's
minds^[449](#calibre_link-479){#calibre_link-943 .calibre13}^

[]{#calibre_link-1159 .calibre2}

However, in the newer collection of Ryōkan's waka compiled by Toshirō
Tanigawa ([谷川]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"} [敏朗]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) and published by Shunjusha in 1996, this waka is not
considered to be Ryōkan's
own.^[450](#calibre_link-480){#calibre_link-944 .calibre13}^ Ryōkan
might have done calligraphy of someone else's waka and whoever came into
possession of the calligraphy could have assumed it was composed by
Ryōkan himself. However, according to Tanigawa's collection, the source
of this waka is not Dōgen but the [Waka Collection of]{.italice}
[Ten-thousand Generations]{.italice} ([万代和歌集]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Mandai wakashū]{.italice}), a large waka anthology
compiled in 1249, while Dōgen was alive. I tried to find this waka out
of the almost four thousand poems in the [Waka Collection of
Ten-thousand Generations]{.italice}, but I eventually gave up.

Possibly this poem is neither Dōgen's nor Ryōkan's work. However, if we
assume it was composed by Dōgen, he likely wanted to say that people can
surely attain the Way if they practice. In Dōgen's time, the notion that
humans were living in the age of the last Dharma ([末法]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [mòfǎ]{.italice}; Jp. [mappō]{.italice}) was
widespread. People believed that because they lived in that degenerate
age, even if they practiced it would not be possible to attain the Way.
That was one of the reasons Pure Land Buddhism became popular in
medieval Japan. People believed the age of the last Dharma had begun in
1052 CE. However, Dōgen did not agree.

In [Shōbōgenzō zuimonki]{.italice}, he wrote:

::: block
Many people of worldly society say, "Although I have the aspiration to
study the Way, the world is in the age of the last Dharma. People's
quality has been declining, and I have only inferior capabilities. I
cannot bear to practice in accordance with the Dharma. I would like to
follow an easier path that is suitable to me, to merely make a
connection \[with the Buddha\] and hope to attain realization in a
future lifetime."
:::

And Dōgen expressed his counterargument:

::: block
Now, I say that this utterance is totally wrong. In the Buddhadharma,
distinguishing the three periods of time---the ages
[]{#calibre_link-1118 .calibre2}of the true Dharma, the semblance
Dharma, and the last Dharma---is only a temporary expedient. The genuine
teaching of the Way is not like this. When we practice, all of us should
be able to attain \[the Way\]. Monks while \[Shakyamuni\] was alive were
not necessarily superior. There were some monks who had incredibly
despicable minds and who were inferior in capacity. The Buddha set forth
various kinds of precepts for the sake of bad people and inferior
people. Each and every human being has the possibility \[to clarify\]
the Dharma. Do not think that you are not a vessel \[of the
Buddhadharma\]. When we practice in accordance \[with the Dharma\], all
of us should be able to attain \[the Way\]. Because we already have a
mind, we can distinguish between good and bad. Because we have hands and
feet, we do not lack anything for doing [gasshō]{.italice} and walking.
In practicing the Buddhadharma, we should not be concerned with the
quality \[of people\]. All beings within the human realm are all
vessels. It is not possible \[to practice the Buddhadharma\] if we are
born as animals or something else. People who study the Way should not
wait for tomorrow. Only today and in this moment, we must practice
following the Buddha.^[451](#calibre_link-481){#calibre_link-945
.calibre13}^
:::

Dōgen's opinion is that if we arouse the mind of awakening and study and
practice the teaching, we cannot fail to attain the Way. This is one of
the reasons he emphasized the identity of practice and realization. When
we practice, realization is manifested immediately. This agrees with
what the Buddha said in the first two verses of Dhammapada:

1\.

What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present
thoughts build our life of tomorrow: our life is the creation of our
mind.

[]{#calibre_link-1223 .calibre2}

If a man speaks or acts with an impure mind, suffering follows him as
the wheel of the cart follows the beast that draws the cart.

2\.

What we are today comes from our thoughts of yesterday, and our present
thoughts build our life of tomorrow: our life is the creation of our
mind.

If a man speaks or acts with a pure mind, joy follows him as his own
shadow.^[452](#calibre_link-482){#calibre_link-946 .calibre13}^

Without telling others

I've been appreciating

nothing other than mountains and rivers

in autumn twilight

in the world

As mentioned in the introduction, Dōgen's father, Minamoto no Michitomo,
was a well-known waka poet who served as one of the six editors who
compiled the [New Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern]{.italice}
([新古今和歌集]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}[;]{.italice} Jp. [Shin kokin
wakashū]{.italice}) commissioned by Emperor Go-Toba ([後鳥羽]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"};1180--1239 CE). The collection was first completed in
1210, but the selection process was extended by the emperor until 1216.
[]{#calibre_link-1202 .calibre2}Therefore, until Dōgen was at least ten
years old, his father would have been working on this process of
selecting almost two thousand poems from a much larger pool of available
waka. Another famous poet also worked on the editing process:
Michitomo's friend Fujiwara no
Sadaie^[453](#calibre_link-483){#calibre_link-947 .calibre13}^
([藤原定家]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1162--1241 CE).

In the [New Collection of Poems Ancient and Modern]{.italice}, three
famous waka about the beauty and subtle profundity of autumn twilight
(Jp. [秋の夕暮れ]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; [aki no yūgure]{.italice})
are included. One was composed by Sadaie:

Looking around

neither flowers nor tinted leaves

only a rush-thatched cottage in the inlet

autumn twilight

It is said that an appreciation of the serene beauty of late autumn,
without showy images such as flowers or brightly colored leaves, was not
found in Japanese poetry before the [New Collection of Poems Ancient
and]{.italice} [Modern]{.italice}. This waka by Sadaie in particular has
been esteemed as a quintessential expression of subtle profundity
([幽玄]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [yūgen]{.italice})---or the
[wabisabi]{.italice} ([侘び寂び]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) prized in
later Japanese arts such as Noh theater, tea ceremony, [renga]{.italice}
([連歌]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; linked verse), and haiku. Although
[wabi]{.italice} and [sabi]{.italice} were originally two different
concepts, in modern times these came to be used as a single term.
[Wabi]{.italice} is the attitude of finding satisfaction in poverty or
deficiency. [Sabi]{.italice} is the sense of beauty in solitude and
stillness.

Many people relish the luxurious beauty of spring flowers, such as
cherry blossoms, or the spectacular changing leaves in the mountains in
mid-autumn. Japanese often have parties to enjoy a day in nature,
[]{#calibre_link-1232 .calibre2}and many poems have been composed on
these occasions. After all this exciting beauty has passed, in the late
autumn when people expect the cold, snowy winter to begin at any time,
no one makes an effort to enjoy the scenery. However, in the quiet,
rather lonely scenery of late autumn twilight people can find a much
more profound beauty. This beauty is not something we proclaim loudly
and enthusiastically with other people. Rather, we quietly savor it
within ourselves.

If this waka was composed by Dōgen, I think he wanted to express more
than an appreciation of such serene beauty. I believe this waka
expresses what he called "turning the light inward and illuminating the
self" ([回向返照]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [ekō henshō]{.italice})
in the "Universal Recommendation of Zazen" ([普勧坐禅儀]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Fukanzazengi") Although this translation works in
the context of the "Universal Recommendation of Zazen," it is actually
not a literal translation. A more literal translation would be "turning
light, returning illumination"---that is, a description of the sky after
sunset. The sun has already set below the horizon, but its light
"returns" and illuminates the entire sky, making it glow. This is the
time of transition between day (when people think and act) and night
(when people rest and sleep). Zazen is like evening twilight; the time
of thinking is already gone, but we do not have the complete darkness of
nonthinking either. Evening twilight in late autumn expresses the beauty
of zazen. Settling down in this quiet tranquility and illuminating the
self is the way to avoid wasting time.

Illuminated by the moon dwelling

in the quiet mind

even the waves are dissolving

into light

The "quiet mind" is the mind in zazen. In the fascicle of the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} called "Eight Aspects of the Awakening of Great
Beings" ([八大人覺]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Hachi dainin gaku"),
Dōgen Zenji quotes the [Sutra on the Teachings Bequeathed by]{.italice}
[the Buddha]{.italice} ([佛遺教經]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[Fóyíjiào jīng]{.italice}; Jp. [Butsuyuikyō gyō]{.italice}) on the third
aspect: "The third is to enjoy serenity. Departing from crowds and
noise, and staying alone in a quiet place is called enjoying serenity."

"Serenity" is a translation of [jakujō]{.italice} ([寂静]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), which means quiet, tranquil, serene, or solitary. This
does not simply mean silent or without external noise. When our minds
are torn, there is always dispute, conflict, or anxiety. Such conditions
make our minds unsettled and agitated. Often when we sit in the quiet
zendo, we begin to hear noise from inside ourselves. Our zazen of
letting go of thoughts enables us to sit imperturbably, without being
pulled around by internal or external conditions.

In this waka, Dōgen describes zazen using the scenery of a rocky coast
where the waves incessantly hit the rocks and break into tiny drops of
water. In each and every drop, the moonlight is reflected. In our zazen,
thoughts, images, emotions, and memories are like waves constantly
coming and going, but when we let go of them they cease to be
[our]{.italice} thinking. Thoughts are coming and going, but we do not
think. We are not deceived or controlled by thoughts. We do not take any
action based on the waves. Within zazen, each thought coming and going
without being grasped becomes simply the scenery of our zazen.

This waka is the fourth of the thirteen supplementary poems in the
Shunjusha text. It appears only in two versions of the
[Record]{.italice} [of Kenzei]{.italice}. A waka that is almost the same
is included in Menzan's []{#calibre_link-1229 .calibre2}[Verses on the
Way from Sanshō]{.italice} [Peak]{.italice} ([傘松道詠]{.japaneese

waka, entitled "Zazen":

Illuminated by the moon dwelling

in the mind-water without cloudiness,

even the waves are dissolving

into light

Only the beginning is slightly different. I think these are not really
two separate waka, but rather two versions of the same poem. There is no
evidence to judge which is Dōgen's original, or even whether either was
composed by Dōgen. However, if these poems were written by Dōgen they
are surely connected with what he wrote in [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}
"Genjokoan":

::: block
When a person attains realization, it is like the moon's reflection in
water. The moon never becomes wet; the water is never disturbed.
Although the moon is a vast and great light, it is reflected in a drop
of water. The whole moon and even the whole sky are reflected in a drop
of dew on a blade of grass. Realization does not destroy the person, as
the moon does not make a hole in the water. The person does not obstruct
realization, as a drop of dew does not obstruct the moon in the sky. The
depth is the same as the height. \[To investigate the significance of\]
the length and brevity of time, we should consider whether the water is
great or small, and understand the size of the moon in the
sky.^[454](#calibre_link-484){#calibre_link-948 .calibre13}^

[]{#calibre_link-1199 .calibre2}

The [Flower Adornment]{.italice} [Sutra]{.italice} ([華嚴經]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}, Ch. [Huáyán jīng]{.italice}; Jp. [Kegon kyō]{.italice};
Skt. [Avataṃsaka-sūtra]{.italice}) describes what it calls "ocean-seal
[samādhi]{.italice}" ([海印三昧]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [kaiin
zanmai]{.italice}; Skt. [sāgara-mudrā-samādhi]{.italice}). According to
this teaching, water is the original mind-nature, peaceful and quiet,
reflecting everything as it is, like a clear mirror. However, when the
wind of ignorance begins to blow, the water's surface is agitated and
waves arise. Then the ocean's surface can no longer reflect things as
they are. In this teaching, meditation practice is a method of restoring
the original calmness by stopping the wind of ignorance, which is
discriminative thinking, so the mind can reflect all things as they are
once again. The ocean water thus becomes like a seal or stamp, which
copies an image just as it is. Devotees of the [Flower Adornment
Sutra]{.italice} called this sort of meditation "contemplation for
eliminating delusory thoughts and returning to the source"
([妄尽還源観]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; [mōjin kangen kan]{.italice}).

However, Dōgen criticizes this interpretation in the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Acupuncture Needle of Zazen"
([坐禪箴]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Zazenshin"):

::: block
Their writings seem only to discuss [going back to the source
or]{.italice} [returning to the origin, and vainly endeavoring to stop
thinking]{.italice} [and become absorbed in tranquility. . .
.]{.italice} How could such people have received the single transmission
of zazen of the buddhas and ancestors? Since the chroniclers of the Song
dynasty have mistakenly included these writings, students in later ages
should discard them without reading
them.^[455](#calibre_link-485){#calibre_link-949 .calibre13}^
:::

In another fascicle of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} called "Ocean-Seal
Samādhi" ([海印三昧]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Kaiin Zanmai"),
Dōgen wrote further about his understanding of this term, which is quite
different from the traditional interpretation:

::: block
To be the buddhas and ancestors is always the ocean-seal samadhi. As
they swim in this samadhi, they have a time to teach, a time to verify,
a time to practice. Their virtue of walking on the ocean goes to its
bottom: they walk on the ocean as []{#calibre_link-1208
.calibre2}"walking the floor of the deepest ocean." To seek to cause the
currents of birth and death to return to the source is not "What are you
thinking?"^[456](#calibre_link-486){#calibre_link-950 .calibre13}^
:::

Here Dōgen says his practice of zazen is not a method of stopping the
winds of ignorance, that is, renouncing thinking and making the ocean's
surface completely quiet so it can reflect things as they are. Rather,
in this waka Dōgen says that even the waves of thought and delusion
themselves turn into moonlight.

waka, [Verses on the Way from Sanshō]{.italice} [Peak]{.italice}. We do
not know where Menzan found this poem. There is a similar poem in a
later collection of Dōgen's waka found at a temple called Yūkon-zan

Seeing with ears and hearing with
eyes^[457](#calibre_link-487){#calibre_link-951 .calibre13}^

There's no doubt

the jewel-like raindrops

dripping from the eaves

are myself

In the Rinzai tradition, this waka is attributed to Shuhō Myōchō
([宗峰妙超]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1282--1338 CE). However, the final
line of Shuhō Myōchō's waka is a little different: seeing with ears and
hearing with eyes / there is no doubt that the jewel-like raindrops /
dripping from the eaves / [are as they simply are]{.italice}
([おのずからなる]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; [onozukara naru]{.italice}).
As in some other cases, we have no evidence to judge whether this is
really Dōgen's waka or not.

The title of this waka, "Jingqing's Sound of Raindrops," refers to the
kōan in case forty-six of the [Blue Cliff]{.italice} [Record]{.italice},
which includes the following the conversation between Zen Master
Jingqing Daofu ([鏡清道怤]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Kyōsei Dōfu;
863--937 CE) and a monk:

::: block
Jingqing asked a monk, "What sound is that outside the gate?"

The monk said, "The sound of raindrops."

Jingqing said, "Sentient beings are inverted. They lose themselves and
follow after things." ([衆生顛倒]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}[、]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}[迷己遂物]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"})

Then the monk said, "What about you, Teacher?"

Jingqing said, "I almost don't lose myself."

The monk said, "What is the meaning of 'I almost don't lose myself?'"

Jingqing said, "Though it still should be easy to express oneself, to
say the whole thing has to be
difficult."^[458](#calibre_link-488){#calibre_link-952 .calibre13}^
:::

[]{#calibre_link-1162 .calibre2}

In this kōan, the Zen Master Jingqing and his student are inside a
building and hear a sound. This kōan is about the relation between the
six sense organs and their objects, in this case, [ear]{.italice} and
[sound]{.italice}. Because it was raining outside, the monk answered his
teacher that the sound was raindrops. Then Jingqing responds that
sentient beings view things in an upside-down manner. They lose
themselves chasing after this and that. This response is based on a
teaching of the [Śūraṅgama Sūtra]{.italice} ([大佛頂首楞嚴經]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [Dà fódǐng]{.italice} [shǒulèngyán jīng]{.italice};
Jp. [Dai butchō shuryōgon kyō]{.italice}):

::: block
[一切衆生從無始來迷己爲物。失於本心爲物所轉。]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}
:::

::: block
From the time without beginning, all beings have [mistakenly
identified]{.italice} [themselves]{.italice} [with what they are aware
of]{.italice}. Controlled by their experience of perceived objects, they
lose track of their fundamental
minds.^[459](#calibre_link-489){#calibre_link-953 .calibre13}^
:::

In this version, [meiko imotsu]{.italice} ([迷己爲物]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; a literal translation might be "being deluded in the
self, they consider \[the self\] to be an objective thing") is rendered
as "mistakenly identify themselves with what they are aware of." After
this, beings are affected and controlled by the perceived objects. This
is like a person who paints a demon and then feels threatened by their
painted image.

"Their fundamental minds" refers to the terms One Mind
([一心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}), Mind Nature ([心性]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), and Original Mind ([本心]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"})---the mind source as noumenon. In this section of the
[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]{.italice}, the fundamental mind
([本妙明浄心]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [honmyō meijō
shin]{.italice}; literally "the originally pure and wondrous mind") is
compared to an innkeeper. In contrast, the thinking mind, which arises
due to encountering objects and is thus based on a dichotomy between
subject and object, is likened to the visitors of the inn. The thinking
mind is conditioned, impermanent, and ever changing, but the innkeeper
is always present and therefore permanent.

[]{#calibre_link-1217 .calibre2}

The [Śūraṅgama Sūtra]{.italice} claims that when we lose sight of the
true essence of the self (the fundamental mind), we identify ourselves
as the subject facing the objects we encounter. We discriminate among
those objects, evaluate them, and try to chase after or escape from
them, and thus we begin to transmigrate within saṃsāra. Being deluded by
the discriminative mind and losing our connection with the fundamental
mind is the cause of suffering within saṃsāra.

However, Dōgen did not always appreciate the [Śūraṅgama]{.italice}
[Sūtra]{.italice}, probably because it promoted this concept of an
"original fundamental mind" as noumenon. Jingqing says people are
deluded and lose themselves chasing after external things, which causes
subject and object to become separate. When these are separate and
interact, something arises in our minds. In the kōan, a thought comes up
in the student's mind and he says, "That was the sound of raindrops." He
grasps onto himself as the subject that is hearing the sound of
raindrops. According to this master's teaching, at that moment the
student loses his fundamental self, chases after an object (sound), and
becomes the subject (hearer) performing an action (hearing).

According to the [Śūraṅgama Sūtra]{.italice}, this means that all
discriminative thinking caused by interactions between the sense organs
and their objects is delusion. We should therefore stop thinking,
restore our calmness, and simply awaken to our pure and bright
fundamental mind, free of all duality and defilements. Based on this
teaching, Jingqing is saying that as soon as the monk hears the sound of
the raindrops and tries to answer his teacher's question, he has fallen
into the duality between subject and object. When the monk's mind is
divided into subject and object, he has lost his original self.

Similarly, in the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "One Bright Jewel"
([一顆明珠]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Ikka myōju") Dōgen writes:
"The 'entire ten-directions' means the ceaseless activity of chasing
after things and making them into the self, and chasing after the self
and making it into things." Dōgen uses an expression similar to
Jingqing's, but he uses it in a more positive way. If this waka was
written by Dōgen, I think he wanted to express that our life consists of
endless interactions between the self []{#calibre_link-1168
.calibre2}and myriad things, but that the self and myriad things do not
exist only within the dichotomy of subject and objects. Rather, they
work together as a part of the total function ([全機]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [zenki]{.italice}) of the entire network of
interdependent origination. In [Instructions for the Cook]{.italice}
([典座教訓]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Tenzo kyōkun]{.italice}),
Dōgen writes, "All day and all night things come to mind and the mind
attends to them; and at one with them all, diligently carry on the
Way."^[460](#calibre_link-490){#calibre_link-954 .calibre13}^

In this case, "mind" means the [tenzo]{.italice} or the self. Things
come to the self, and the self attends to them. This is the way the self
and myriad things work together as one reality. The important point here
is being attentive. We need to intimately work with myriad things in a
way that expresses our awakening to the reality of impermanence,
selflessness, and interconnection.

Grasses lie unseen

in the field under snow

the white egret hides itself

in its own appearance

This is the scenery of a midwinter's day. All kinds of grasses, short
and tall, are buried under deep snow. This scene is very different from
snow on the bright leaves of autumn. The entire world is covered in
snow, and it is still snowing continually. The bird is also white, so we
cannot distinguish it from its environment. It seems the bird is hiding
within its own color.

The practice of making prostrations is the same. We are part of the
network of interdependent origination and by offering prostrations, we
hide ourselves within the world of interdependent origination. We
disappear into this world and become one with all beings.

In the [Record of the Hōkyō Era]{.italice} ([宝慶記]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Hōkyō ki]{.italice}), Dōgen recorded one of his
dialogues with his teacher Tiantong Rujing ([天童如浄]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Tendo Nyojō; 1163--1228 CE). When Dōgen made a
prostration, Rujing said, "As for their nature, the person who makes a
prostration and the person who receives it are empty and serene. The
correspondence and interpenetration of the Way between them is beyond
comprehension."^[461](#calibre_link-491){#calibre_link-955 .calibre13}^
Not only the giver and receiver of a prostration but all
[]{#calibre_link-1235 .calibre2}beings in the entire Dharma world are
hidden within this prostration. Everything disappears into the deep,
white snow of the Dharma.

The moon begins to rise

above the mountain's brow

in glimmering evening moonbeams

fireflies take flight

glowing softly

[]{#calibre_link-1210 .calibre2}

From mid-June to early July, we see fireflies on the grounds of
Sanshin-ji here in Bloomington, Indiana. The tiny lights floating around
trees and bamboo are very pretty.

A Japanese proverb says, "[Hotaru]{.italice} [hatsuka ni, semi
mikka]{.italice}" ([蛍二十日に蝉三日]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"})---meaning, "a firefly lives only twenty days, a cicada
only three." As beings with brief life spans, both of these insects
symbolize impermanence.

In Buddhist sutras, a firefly's glow is often compared with the light of
the sun or moon.^[462](#calibre_link-492){#calibre_link-956 .calibre13}^
The light of a firefly symbolizes narrow and conditioned human thought,
whereas the sunlight and moonlight represent Buddha's boundless wisdom.
This waka is about early evening in summer. The sun has already set, but
the sky is not yet dark. The moon emerges behind a mountain ridge, but
its radiance does not dominate the sky.

This is a beautiful time of transition from day to night, from the time
of discrimination and activity to the time of nondistinction and rest.
The fireflies are like human beings who have aroused the mind of
awakening. The light of such ordinary bodhisattvas is tiny and glows
only briefly, and yet this light is the same as the vast moonlight of
Buddha's wisdom.

To what can this world be compared?

Moonlight reflected in drops

splashed from the beak of a waterfowl

[]{#calibre_link-1160 .calibre2}

This waka appears only in Menzan's collection [Verses on the Way from
Sanshō Peak]{.italice} ([傘松道詠]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Sanshō
dōei]{.italice}). Again it is not clear where he found this poem. If it
was composed by Dōgen, he likely was expressing the beauty of
impermanence and the interpenetration of transience and eternity.

A waterfowl dives into a pond and surfaces. It shakes its bill; the
water drops fall. In each and every drop, the boundless moonlight is
reflected. The drops stay in the air less than a moment before returning
to the pond. Each drop is as bright as the moon itself. Dōgen believes
our lives in this world are the same: as impermanent as water drops and
yet, as he wrote in "Genjokoan," reflecting the boundless moonlight.

From the end of the Heian era (1185) to the beginning of the Kamakura
era (1192), Japan experienced a transition in social structure and
political power. The emperor's court was losing power, while the samurai
were gaining it. During this growth of the warrior class, there were
countless battles between the Heike and Genji clans, including in Kyoto,
the capital. Finally, at the end of the twelfth century, the shogunate
government was established in Kamakura by Minamoto no Yoritomo
([源頼朝]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1147--1199). During this societal
transition, Japan also endured many natural disasters. People saw piles
of dead bodies on the banks of the Kamo River in Kyoto due to the
various battles and natural catastrophes. There was a widespread belief
that the age of the last Dharma ([末法]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[mòfǎ]{.italice}; Jp. [mappō]{.italice}) had begun in 1052 CE, and the
world was falling deeper into degeneracy. People clearly recognized the
impermanence of individual lives and society.

Dōgen's contemporary Kamo no Chōmei ([鴨長明]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"};
1155--1216 CE) wrote a collection of essays entitled [Hōjōki]{.italice}
([方丈記]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; [The Ten-Foot Square Hut]{.italice})
in 1212, one year before Dōgen became a monk at Enryaku-ji on Mt. Hiei.
Chōmei wrote about the situation in Kyoto. He recorded disasters, such
as great fires, whirlwinds, typhoons, and earthquakes, in addition to
the devastation caused by the civil wars between the Heike and Genji
clans:

[]{#calibre_link-1209 .calibre2}

::: block
\[1\] Though the river's current never fails, the water passing, moment
by moment, is never the same. Where the current pools, bubbles form on
the surface, bursting and disappearing as others rise to replace them,
none lasting long. In this world, people and their dwelling places are
like that, always changing. . . . \[3\] Nor is it clear to me, as people
are born and die, where they are coming from and where they are going.
Nor why, being so ephemeral in this world, they take such pains to make
their houses pleasing to the eye. The master and the dwelling are
competing in their transience. Both will perish from this world like the
morning glory that blooms in the morning dew. In some cases, the dew may
evaporate first, while the flower remains---but only to be withered by
the morning sun. In others, the flower may wither even before the dew is
gone, but no one expects the dew to last until
evening.^[463](#calibre_link-493){#calibre_link-957 .calibre13}^
:::

These are well-known examples of people's sense of transience and the
vanity of life in the mundane world during Dōgen's time. However,
Dōgen's insight into impermanence is very different from these
pessimistic views of the fleeting world. In this waka, although
realizing impermanence is sad and painful, it is also how we arouse the
mind of awakening and come to perceive eternity within impermanence.

[]{#calibre_link-1153 .calibre2}

I won't stop by

the banks of the valley stream

so my appearance isn't reflected

because I think the water will flow

into the world of saṃsāra

Supplementary poems 11 and 12, both titled "Mountain Dwelling"
([山居]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [sankyo]{.italice}), are taken
from the collection [Ryakugebon]{.italice} ([略解本]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), a commentary on Menzan's collection of Dōgen's waka,
[Verses on the Way from Sanshō Peak.]{.italice} The author of the
[Ryakugebon]{.italice} was a monk named Kakugan ([覚巖]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}), who was the abbot of Entsu-ji ([円通寺]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) in Kurashiki City in Okayama Prefecture in the nineteenth
century. We do not know where Kakugan found these poems. Entsu-ji is the
temple where the famous monk-poet Ryōkan practiced with his master,
Dainin Kokusen ([大忍国仙]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; 1723--1791).

This waka is very similar to supplementary poem number one, and its
meaning is the same. Please see my comments there.

The moon on the mountain's brow

no friend

to this mountain dweller

because it moves also

in the floating world

The meaning of this poem is similar to supplementary poems one and
eleven. It seems Dōgen is saying he does not want to interact with the
valley stream or the moon, because they are connected to the
[]{#calibre_link-1224 .calibre2}mundane world. It is difficult for me to
think Dōgen had such a negative attitude toward everyday life and people
in the world. It is true that as a Zen Buddhist monk Dōgen emphasized
the renunciation of fame and profit so he would not need to rely on
political or economic power. However, his practice in the mountains was
not an escape from the world. He also cherished the sounds of valley
streams as Buddha's voice and the moon as the boundless, radiant light
of all interdependent origination.

If Dōgen really composed this waka, I would like to read it as follows:

The moon on the mountain's brow

cannot always accompany

this mountain dweller

because it needs to move on

and illuminate those in the world of saṃsāra

The moon and the valley streams illuminate and expound the Dharma not
only for monks practicing in secluded mountains but also for people
living their everyday lives.

On Nio Lake

a ferryboat is sailing

off Yabase's shore

I'd like to push it

to meet the person

[]{#calibre_link-1177 .calibre2}

[Nio]{.italice} is an old word for [kaitsuburi]{.italice}
([鸊鷉]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Little Grebe, [Tachybaptus
ruficollis]{.italice}), a species of waterfowl. The largest freshwater
lake in Japan, Lake Biwa, which is located in Shiga Prefecture, was
formerly called Nio no Umi (Nio Lake) because many grebes and other
waterbirds live there. Today the Little Grebe is the prefectural bird of
Shiga. Lake Biwa can be seen from Mt. Hiei, where Dōgen practiced for
several years as a novice.

Yabase is a town on the eastern coast of Lake Biwa, in what is now
Kusatsu City. In ancient times, Yabase was well known as the port of a
ferry between Kusatsu and Ōtsu, the city that is now the capital of
Shiga Prefecture and which lies on the western coast of the lake. This
boat ride was a major shortcut to get to Kyoto as it was much faster
than walking all the way around the lake. [Afumi]{.italice} in the last
line is a pun on the old name for Shiga (Ōmi province;
[近江国]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}) and "to meet the person."
[Afu]{.italice} can mean "to meet" (Modern Japanese [会う]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; [au]{.italice}), and [mi]{.italice} ([身]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) means a "body" or "person."[　]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}

The first three lines of this waka depict the scenery of Lake Biwa. A
ferryboat is sailing offshore of Yabase. Then the poet says that even
though the boat is already taking the quickest route, he wishes to hurry
to meet the person as soon as possible.

This poem was found by the scholar Dōshū Ōkubo ([大久保道舟]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}) in the [Wistera Leaves Waka Collection]{.italice}
([藤葉和歌集]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Tōyō wakashū]{.italice}), a
collection of waka compiled by Ogura Sanenori ([小倉実教]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; n.d.) in the Nanbokuchō period (1336--1392 CE). Ōkubo
included this poem in the collection of Dōgen's waka as part of [Dōgen
Zenji zenshū]{.italice}, published by Chikuma Shobō in 1970. Ōkubo wrote
in his [Dōgen Zenji den no]{.italice} [kenkyū]{.italice} that this waka
might be evidence that, while he lived in Fukakusa, Dōgen attended
gatherings of aristocrats for the purpose of composing waka.

In the [Wistera Leaves Waka Collection]{.italice}, this waka is included
in the section of love poems, so people considered this a poem about a
person who wishes to meet their lover as soon as possible by pushing the
boat. Because of this reading, some hesitate to consider this to be a
poem written by Dōgen. However, it is possible that it is not
necessarily a []{#calibre_link-1231 .calibre2}love poem and the compiler
of the waka collection merely thought it was about a lover's sentiments.

I have no basis for deciding whether this waka was written by Dōgen
Zenji. All I can suggest is that in the fascicle of the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} titled "Continuous Practice" ([行持]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Gyōji") Dōgen wrote about his encounter with his
late master Rujing (Jp. Nyojō): "I saw my late master with my own eyes;
this is \[truly\] meeting with a person"
([まのあたり先師をみる]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}[、]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}[これ人にあふなり]{.japaneese lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Manoatari
senshi wo miru kore hito ni afunari]{.italice}).

If this waka was written by Dōgen, I think the expression [hito ni
afu]{.italice} ("to meet a person") could mean to meet a true person of
the Way. In [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} [zuimonki]{.italice}, Dōgen talked
about meeting many such people who completely dedicated their lives to
the Buddha Way.

As Dōgen wrote in [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} "Being Time" ([有時]{.japaneese
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Uji"):

Jing" (Ch. [淨和尚]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, Jìng [héshàng]{.italice};
Jp. [浄和尚]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, Jō [oshō]{.italice}) refers to
Dōgen's teacher Tiantong Rujing (Ch. [天童如淨]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [天童如浄]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, Tendō Nyojō;
1163--1228 CE). "Venerable Gen" ([元子]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
Yuán [zǐ]{.italice}; Jp. Gen [su]{.italice}) refers to Dōgen. Dōgen went
to Song dynasty China together with his teacher Myōzen
([明全]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; 1184--1225 CE) in 1223. In 1225 Dōgen
began to practice under the guidance of Rujing, a Dharma heir of Xuedou
Zhijian ([雪竇智鑑]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Setchō Chikan;
1105--92 CE). During his two and a half years with Rujing, Dōgen
recorded some of their conversations in [The Record]{.italice} [of the
Hōkyō Era]{.italice} ([宝慶記]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[Hōkyōki]{.italice}). Rujing had become the abbot of Tiantong monastery
in 1224 at the age of fifty-eight. Dōgen received Dharma transmission
from Rujing in 1227 and returned to Japan shortly thereafter. Rujing
died in the same year.

[[20](#calibre_link-514){#calibre_link-43 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}In the
[Rules of Purity in]{.italice} [the Chan Monastery]{.italice} (Ch.
[禪苑清規]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, [Chányuàn qīngguī]{.italice}; Jp.
[禅苑清規]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, [Zen'en shingi]{.italice}), the
following is said about the position of abbot's attendant
([侍者]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [shìzhě]{.italice}; Jp.
[jisha]{.italice}): "If an abbot's attendant needs to be appointed, he
should be young and physically strong, his words should be precise and
clear, he should be righteous in the observance of the precepts, and he
should be especially quick-witted; then everything in the abbot's office
will be accomplished with natural ease. . . . Although the abbot's
attendants are appointed by the rector, they must first be selected by
the abbot" (Yifa, [Origins of Buddhist Monastic Codes]{.italice}, 173).

[[21](#calibre_link-515){#calibre_link-44 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"My own
practice of the Way" is a translation of the Japanese [gakudō no
keiko]{.italice} ([学道の稽古]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}).
[Gaku]{.italice} is "study" or "practice," [dō]{.italice} is "the Way,"
and []{#calibre_link-1375 .calibre2}[keiko]{.italice} literally means
"to consider the ancient." This phrase is still used to refer to the
practice of the martial arts, the tea ceremony, and other traditional
Japanese arts.\
     "Great monastery" here translates [dai sōrin]{.italice}
([大叢林]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [dà cónglín]{.italice}).
[Dai]{.italice} means great, and [sōrin]{.italice} literally means a
"grove and a forest," symbolizing monks practicing together harmoniously
like trees in a peaceful grove.\
     The scholar Yaoko Mizuno has suggested that this talk was given
when Dōgen appointed Ejō as his abbot's attendant (Mizuno, [Shōbōgenzō
zuimonki]{.italice}, 10). In the section on Ejō in Keizan's [Record of
the Transmission of the Light]{.italice} ([伝光録]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Denkōroku]{.italice}), it is said that Ejō continued
to serve as abbot's attendant until Dōgen's death and that he wanted to
continue in this role even after his death. It says, "After \[Ejō\]
received formal approval, he followed \[Dōgen\] without leaving him for
a single day. He was like a shadow following the form for twenty years.
Although he was given many duties, he remained \[Dōgen's\] attendant,
assuming the position when his other tasks were completed. . . . Not
only that, but during the fifteen years when he was continuing the
teaching at Eihei-ji, he kept his master's portrait beside him in his
quarters. He greeted it each morning with, 'Good morning,' and said,
'Good night' every evening, never forgetting for a single day. He wanted
to be the master's attendant in life after life, as Ananda was to the
Venerable Shakyamuni. Moreover, in order that his illusory body would
not be separated \[from his master\], he had his own remains installed
next to his master's memorial marker as if he were still his attendant,
without a separate marker, fearing that a marker \[for himself\] would
indicate reverence \[for himself\]." (Cook, [Record of Transmitting
the]{.italice} [Light]{.italice}, 269--70)

[[22](#calibre_link-516){#calibre_link-45 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"A vessel"
in this case means having the capacity to receive and maintain the
Buddhadharma. Such statements were based on the assumption that the age
of the last Dharma ([末法]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[mòfǎ]{.italice}; Jp. [mappō]{.italice}) had begun in 1052 CE, as was
the common belief in Japan at the time, and it was therefore not
possible to truly study or practice the Dharma and attain awakening.
This was the last of the so-called three periods ([三時]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [sānshí]{.italice}; Jp. [sanji]{.italice}) following
the Buddha's death. During the age of the true Dharma
([正法]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [zhèngfǎ]{.italice}; Jp.
[shōbō]{.italice}), lasting five hundred (or one thousand) years, the
Buddha's teaching is properly practiced and awakening can be attained.
During the period of the semblance Dharma ([像法]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [xiàngfǎ]{.italice}; Jp. [zōhō]{.italice}), lasting
another five hundred (or one thousand) years, the teaching is practiced,
but awakening is no longer possible. During the period of the last
Dharma, lasting ten thousand years, the teaching exists, but it is not
practiced and there can be no awakening. []{#calibre_link-1376
.calibre2}Belief in this concept greatly influenced Japanese Buddhism in
the Heian period (794--1185 CE) and Kamakura period (1192--1333 CE).
Dōgen did not accept this theory. In fact, his famous teaching equating
practice and enlightenment ([修証一如]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[shūshō]{.italice} [ichinyo]{.italice}) was probably a criticism of the
popular idea that it is of no use to practice in the degenerate age of
the last Dharma. In [Zuimonki]{.italice}, Dōgen discusses this concept
often, for example, in sections 2-13 and 5-8.

[[23](#calibre_link-517){#calibre_link-46 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Dharma
gates" ([法門]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [fǎmén]{.italice}; Jp.
[hōmon]{.italice}) are the Buddhist teachings through which we can enter
the Dharma. It is said that there are eighty-four thousand Dharma gates.
In other words, they are numberless. Because people's problems are
numberless, the teachings as medicine for healing the sicknesses caused
by each problem are also numberless.

[[24](#calibre_link-518){#calibre_link-47 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Golden
bones" ([金骨]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [jīngǔ]{.italice}; Jp.
[kinkotsu]{.italice}) refers to the Buddha's relics; the meaning of the
full statement here is that not all of the ancient practitioners were as
strong and capable as the Buddha.

[[25](#calibre_link-519){#calibre_link-48 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Mind of
awakening" ([道心]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [dàoxīn]{.italice};
Jp. [dōshin]{.italice}) is literally "mind of the Way." The more common
word for this is [bodaishin]{.italice} ([菩提心]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [pútíxīn]{.italice}), a part-transliteration,
part-translation of the Sanskrit word [bodhicitta]{.italice}, itself an
abbreviation of [anuttarā-samyak-]{.italice}[saṃbodhi-citta]{.italice}.
This is the mind that seeks ultimate awakening. In the case of
[dōshin]{.italice}, [dō]{.italice} ([道]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[dào]{.italice}) is an older translation of [bodhi]{.italice}. Sometimes
this mind is also called [gudōshin]{.italice} ([求道心]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [qiúdàoxīn]{.italice}): "Way-seeking mind."

[[26](#calibre_link-520){#calibre_link-49 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Not being
greedy for food, clothing, possessions, or fame and profit is one of the
main topics of [Zuimonki]{.italice}. If the monks who formed the
audience of Dōgen's talks had stayed within the structure of an
established Buddhist institution like the Tendai monastery where Dōgen
had first studied, their lives would have been supported by the
government. Because they had thoroughly renounced institutions connected
with the power of the mundane world, the question of how to support
their practice apparently became a concern. Dōgen repeatedly says that
they should not worry about such things and instead devote themselves to
practice based on the Dharma.

[[27](#calibre_link-521){#calibre_link-50 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}The
meaning of this sentence in this version of the text (the Chōen-ji
version) is not clear. The scholar-priest Rosan Ikeda interprets it as
meaning that receiving food from benefactors is easier than receiving
food only by daily begging (Ikeda, [Gendaigoyaku shōbōgenzō]{.italice}
[zuimonki]{.italice}, 10). Yaoko Mizuno believes it means that receiving
food from benefactors is different from ordinary begging in the mundane
world (Mizuno, [Shōbōgenzō zuimonki]{.italice}, 17). Menzan's version
reads, "\[The food obtained through\] daily begging would never be
exhausted."

[]{#calibre_link-1377 .calibre2}

[[28](#calibre_link-522){#calibre_link-51 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Wrong
livelihood" ([邪命]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [xiémìng]{.italice};
Jp. [jamyō]{.italice}; Skt. [mithyâjīva]{.italice}) is the opposite of
"right livelihood" ([正命]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[zhèngmìng]{.italice}; Jp. [shōmyō]{.italice}; Skt.
[samyag-ājīva]{.italice}), the fifth part of the eightfold noble path.
If monks supported their lives through one of the four occupations
listed in this passage, this was considered wrong livelihood and was
prohibited by the Vinaya precepts. In the [Sutra on the Teachings
Bequeathed by the Buddha]{.italice} ([佛遺教經]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [Fóyíjiào jīng]{.italice}; Jp. [Butsuyuikyō
gyō]{.italice}), Shakyamuni said, "Those of you who uphold the pure
precepts should not buy, sell or trade. You should not covet fields or
buildings, or keep servants or raise animals. You should stay far away
from all kinds of agriculture and wealth as you would avoid a pit of
fire. You should not cut down grass or trees, plow fields or dig the
earth. Nor may you compound medicines, prophesize good and evil, observe
the constellations, cast horoscopes by the waxing and waning of the
moon, or compute astrological fortunes. All of these activities are
improper. Regulate yourselves by eating at the appropriate time and by
living in purity. You should not participate in worldly affairs or act
as an envoy, nor should you become involved with magical spells and
elixirs of immortality, or with making connections with high ranking
people, being affectionate towards them and condescending towards the
lowly" (Buddhist Text Translation Society, [Sutra]{.italice} [on the
Buddha's Bequeathed Teaching]{.italice}).

[[29](#calibre_link-523){#calibre_link-52 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}This story
appears in the twenty-fifth volume of the [Continued Biographies
of]{.italice} [Eminent Monks]{.italice} ([續高僧傳]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [Xù gāosēng zhuàn]{.italice}; Jp. [Zo]{.italice}
[kukōsō den]{.italice}). It was compiled by Nanshan Daoxuan
([南山道宣]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Nanzan Dōsen; 596--667 CE),
the founder of the South Mountain Vinaya school ([南山律宗]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. nánshān lǜzōng; Jp. nanzan risshū). This
thirty-volume collection includes the biographies of monks from the
Liang dynasty (502--57 CE) to the beginning of the Tang dynasty
(618--907 CE). Daoxuan and his school are also remembered for adopting
the precepts of the Dharmaguptaka school ([法藏部]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. fǎzàng bù; Jp. hōzō bu) as the standard Vinaya for
Chinese Buddhism, something that remains the case today.\
     King Yama (Ch. [閻羅王]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, Yánluó wáng; Jp.
[閻魔王]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, Enma-ō) is a [dharmapāla]{.italice},
a wrathful Dharma-protecting god, who is the lord of death and king of
hell in Buddhist mythology. He makes judgments as to where the dead
should go, depending on their wholesome and unwholesome karma.

[[30](#calibre_link-524){#calibre_link-53 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Single
whorl of white hair" is a translation of [byakugō]{.italice}
([白毫]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [báiháo]{.italice}; Skt.
[urnakesa]{.italice}), one of the thirty-two major marks of a buddha. It
is described as a spiral of hair of infinite length located between the
eyebrows and endowed with magical powers. In some sutras, such as
[]{#calibre_link-1378 .calibre2}the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice}, the Buddha
emits a ray of light from his [urnakesa]{.italice}. In the [Buddha
Treasury]{.italice} [Sutra]{.italice} (Ch. [佛藏經]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}, [Fózàng]{.italice} [jīng]{.italice}; Jp.
[仏蔵経]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, [Butsuzō kyō]{.italice}), it is said
that the Buddha will offer a small part of his [urnakesa]{.italice} to
his disciples, which will be enough to support all future monks even if
all human beings become Buddhist monks. It is also said that the Buddha
was to live for one hundred years, but he died when he was eighty years
old in order to offer twenty years of his life to his descendents.
Therefore, Dōgen says we should not worry about food and clothing.

[[31](#calibre_link-525){#calibre_link-54 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Pure
practices" is a translation of [bongyō]{.italice} ([梵行]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [fànxíng]{.italice}), which is the Sino-Japanese
translation of the Sanskrit [brahma-caryā]{.italice}. This expression
was adopted from Brahmanism, where it refers to students dedicating
themselves to studying the teachings and carrying out the holy religious
life. In Buddhism, this word refers to a monk's life of practice
following the precepts, free from the defilement of the three poisons of
greed, anger, and delusion.

[[32](#calibre_link-526){#calibre_link-55 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"The
exoteric and esoteric teachings" refer to the teachings of the Shingon
school (Ch. [眞言宗]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, Zhēnyán zōng; Jp.
[真言宗]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, Shingon shū), in the latter case,
and those of all other schools, in the former case. Shingon, the East
Asian representative of Vajrayāna Buddhism, uses teachings said to be
"esoteric" ([密教]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [mìjiào]{.italice};
Jp. [mikkyō]{.italice}; literally "secret teaching"), while all other
schools use teachings that are "exoteric" (Ch. [顯教]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}, [xiǎnjiào]{.italice}; Jp. [顕教]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}, [kengyō]{.italice}; "revealed teachings"). Zen considers
itself to be outside of both categories because it is claimed it
fundamentally does not rely on scripture.

[[33](#calibre_link-527){#calibre_link-56 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Sichuan is
a province in the southwestern part of China, just east of Tibet. It is
over 1,800 kilometers (just over 1,100 miles) away from Tiantong
monastery, which is located near the modern coastal city of Ningbo.

[[34](#calibre_link-528){#calibre_link-57 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}The
founder of Xuefeng monastery was Xuefeng Yicun ([雪峰義存]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Seppō Gison; 822--908 CE). "Weedy legumes"
([緑豆]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [lǜdòu]{.italice}; Jp.
[rokuzu]{.italice}) refers to green-colored beans that were
unintentionally harvested along with rice and were usually discarded
later. In [Instructions for]{.italice} [the Cook]{.italice}
([典座教訓]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Tenzo kyōkun]{.italice}),
Dōgen wrote, "First, take out any insects in the rice. And carefully
winnow out any weedy legumes, rice bran, or tiny stones."

[[35](#calibre_link-529){#calibre_link-58 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Devadatta
was a cousin of Śākyamuni Buddha and a brother of Ānanda. He became a
disciple of the Buddha together with Ānanda and other young people of
the Śākya clan. Later, Devadatta was supported by King Ajātaśatru, who
built a monastery for him and sent daily offerings of five hundred
cartloads of provisions. []{#calibre_link-1379 .calibre2}Devadatta asked
Śākyamuni to retire in an attempt to become the head of the Buddhist
Sangha. When the Buddha declined, Devadatta attempted to kill him. He is
also said to have encouraged Ajātaśatru to kill his father, Bimbisāra,
the king of Magadha.

[[36](#calibre_link-530){#calibre_link-59 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Physical
behavior" is a translation of [mi no igi]{.italice}
([身の威儀]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}). [Mi]{.italice} means "body."
[Igi]{.italice} ([威儀]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[wēiyí]{.italice}) can be translated as "comportment" or "dignified
conduct," as, for example, in the fascicle of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}
entitled "The Dignified Conduct of the Practice-Buddha"
([行佛威儀]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Gyōbutsu-Igi"). Dōgen's
title of this fascicle represents his unusual alternative understanding
of this phrase, which would normally be read as "practicing the Buddha's
dignified conduct." The bodily actions of walking, standing still,
sitting, and lying down are also called the "four comportments"
([四威儀]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [sìwēiyí]{.italice}; Jp. [shi
igi]{.italice}).

[[37](#calibre_link-531){#calibre_link-60 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Moral
codes and forms" is a translation of [ritsugi]{.italice}
([律儀]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [lǜyí]{.italice}), literally
"regulations and forms." It is, in turn, a translation of the Sanskrit
word [saṃvara]{.italice}, meaning "restraint." This refers to the fact
that by following moral codes, one can restrain one's unwholesome
behavior.

[[38](#calibre_link-532){#calibre_link-61 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}See note
25.

[[39](#calibre_link-533){#calibre_link-62 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Ancient
practices" is a translation of [kojitsu]{.italice} ([故実]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [故實]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, [gùshí]{.italice}),
meaning the way certain things have been done in a certain tradition and
the directions that people must follow in order to continue that
tradition.

[[40](#calibre_link-534){#calibre_link-63 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"A good

The lecturer Liangsui visited Magu for the first time. Upon seeing
Liangsui coming, Magu took a hoe and began hoeing up weeds. Although
Liangsui went to where Magu was working, Magu paid no attention to him,
but rather immediately went back to the abbot's quarters and shut the
gate. The next day, Liangsui visited Magu again. Magu shut the gate
again. Liangsui then knocked on the gate. Magu asked, "Who is this?"
"Liangsui!" Upon calling out his own name, the lecturer suddenly
attained realization. He said, "Master, do not deceive Liangsui. If I
had not come and made obeisance to you, I would have been deceived by
the sutras []{#calibre_link-1380 .calibre2}and commentaries for my
entire lifetime." When Liangsui went back to his lecture hall, he gave a
speech, saying, "All you know, Liangsui knows. What Liangsui knows, you
do not know." Then he quit giving lectures and had the people leave.

Bodhisattva Precepts" ([教授戒文]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.

[[43](#calibre_link-537){#calibre_link-66 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}The ten
major precepts and forty-eight minor precepts mentioned in the [Brahmā
Net Sutra]{.italice} are called "the bodhisattva precepts." In the
Tendai tradition, in which Dōgen began his practice, these precepts were
given upon ordination. However, in Dōgen's Sōtō tradition only sixteen
precepts are given---the three refuges, the threefold pure precepts, and
the ten major precepts.

River. There is a legend that if a fish is able []{#calibre_link-1227
.calibre2}to swim up the waterfall, it becomes a dragon. Here, Dōgen
says that, rather than being a specific waterfall along a river, the
Dragon Gate is in the ocean, and further any fish can become a dragon
simply by passing through a particular place in the ocean. Instead of
stating that only strong fish capable of ascending the waterfall are
able to become dragons, Dōgen writes that all fish are able to become
dragons simply by passing through the gate. The Dragon Gate is thus a
metaphor for the monastery, where anyone can come and practice.

Ch. [jiāshā]{.italice}), the robe Buddhist monks wear over one shoulder.
The word is a transliteration of the Sanskrit [kāṣāya]{.italice}, which
literally means "turbid colored." In India, Buddhist monks collected
abandoned, soiled cloth before selecting clean parts to wash and dye a
saffron-like color. They would then make their own robes by sewing these
pieces together. "Patch-robed monks" thus refers to Buddhist monks who
wear such a dyed and patched square robe.

monks of Dōgen's time did not have any interactions with non-Mahāyāna

mostly used as a sort of straw man. The word is now considered

He had a villa in Uji outside of Kyoto, where he constructed the temple

from 1217 to 1223.\
     The term "superintendent of monks" translates [sōjō]{.italice}
([僧正]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [sēngzhèng]{.italice}), another
government rank like "Dharma bridge" in the previous note; Eisai is
often referred to by this title in [Zuimonki]{.italice}. The
superintendent of monks was the highest position within the governmental
system that oversaw Buddhist temples and monks, a system that was first
established in the year 760 in Japan. There were two lower positions
called "director of monks" ([僧都]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch[.

each of these three ranks there were also additional subranks. By the

titles, without actual administrative power, given by the government.

[dāna]{.italice} ("donation") or [dānapati]{.italice} ("a generous
donor"). Although [dāna]{.italice} usually refers to generosity, in
Japan it also came to refer to patrons who would occasionally invite the

similar to a monks' hall ([僧堂]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.

have the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara enshrined. In Dōgen's "Regulations

example of the latter was Eisai ([栄西]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"};

On one occasion Dōgen said: "In the assembly of Zen master Fuzhao, there
was a monk who, when he was sick, wanted to eat meat. The master allowed
him to do so. One night the master himself went to the infirmary and saw
the sick monk eating meat in the dim lamplight. Although the monk
thought he was putting []{#calibre_link-1386 .calibre2}it into his own
mouth, it was not him, but the demon who was eating. After that whenever
a sick monk wanted to eat meat, the master allowed him to do so because
he knew such a monk was possessed by a demon.

Thinking about this story, we must carefully consider whether to allow
\[such a thing\], or not. There was also an instance of eating meat in
the assembly of Wuzu Fayan. Whether allowing or prohibiting it, all the
ancient masters surely had their own deep considerations." (Okumura and

Though there are many names for bodhi mind \[the mind of awakening\],

I think it would be appropriate to talk about\] bodhi mind as the mind
that sees impermanence. Truly, when you see impermanence, egocentric
mind does not arise, neither does desire for fame and profit. Out of
fear of time slipping away too swiftly, practice the Way as if you are
trying to extinguish a fire enveloping your head. Reflecting on the
transiency of your bodily life, practice as diligently as the Buddha did
when he stood on tiptoe for seven days. Even when you hear the melodious

[[86](#calibre_link-580){#calibre_link-110 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}This is a
quotation from a famous dialogue between Baizhang Huaihai (see note 81)
and a former Zen master who had been reborn as a fox in retribution for
stating that accomplished Zen practitioners are not subject to cause and
effect. Taking the form of an old man, he asks for Baizhang's teaching
on the matter. Baizhang tells him that a Zen master is "not blind to
cause and effect." Upon hearing this, the fox is awakened and dies. This
story appears in two major kōan collections: case 8 of the [Book of

additional comments on this story in two fascicles of the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}: "Great Practice" ([大修行]{.japaneese1

the monks in his assembly, and his student Zhaozhou Congshen
([趙州從諗]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Jōshū Jūshin; 778--897 CE).
There is an unspecified argument among the monks about a cat when
Nanquan appears and says he will cut the cat unless his students can say
something. No one speaks, and he cuts the cat in two. Nanquan later
tells Zhaozhou what happened, and in response Zhaozhou takes off his
sandals, puts them on his head, and leaves. Nanquan then says that if
Zhaozhou had been there, he could have saved the cat. This story appears

Guishan asked Yangshan, "How do you understand the wondrous, pure, and
bright mind?"

Yangshan replied, "Mountains, rivers, the great earth, the sun, the
moon, and the stars." (Tanahashi and Loori, [True Dharma Eye]{.italice},
225)
:::

This expression is mentioned by Dōgen in the fascicle of the
[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} entitled "The Mind Is Itself Buddha"
([即心是仏]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Sokushin ze butsu"), where
he wrote, "It should be clearly understood that the Mind is mountains,
rivers, and the great earth, the sun, the moon and the stars." This is
likely part of Dōgen's attempt to reform Ejō's understanding of "mind,"
or Buddha-nature. Ejō's previous teacher taught that Buddha-nature is
something hidden that we must find within us, whereas Dōgen taught that
it is nothing other than ordinary reality prior to our concepts and
ideas.

[[93](#calibre_link-587){#calibre_link-117 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"The mind

[Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} to this expression.

[[94](#calibre_link-588){#calibre_link-118 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Here,
Dōgen is employing one of his common teaching techniques where he
equates two things (in this case, the "cutting of the cat" and the
"action of a Buddha") but then states that each is fundamentally just
that thing itself (i.e., cutting the cat is just cutting the cat). He
does this to pull the student away from conceptualization and dualism
and instead bring their attention to reality as it is. This is famously
found in two fascicles of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}: in "Great
Perfection of Wisdom" ([摩訶般若波羅蜜]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
"Maka hannya haramitsu") where he equates form and emptiness but then
writes that "form is nothing but form; emptiness is nothing but
emptiness," and in "The Samadhi That Is King of Samadhis"
([三昧王三昧]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Zanmai ō zanmai") where he
equates sitting zazen with the Buddhadharma but then states that we must
let sitting just be sitting and the Buddhadharma just be the
Buddhadharma.

]{.ntspa}[Pratimokṣa]{.italice} is Sanskrit for the list of rules
contained in the Vinaya. These are recited in the repentance ceremony

([別解脱戒]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [biéjiětuō jiè]{.italice}),
literally "separate liberation precepts," indicating that by keeping
each precept, monks can attain the liberation corresponding to each
precept. In [The Sutra of the Last Discourse]{.italice} (Ch.
[佛遺教經]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, [Fóyíjiào jīng]{.italice}; Jp.

Shakyamuni says, "Monks, after my death, respect and follow the

been given a light in the dark, or like a pauper who has acquired a

[]{#calibre_link-1389 .calibre2}

[[96](#calibre_link-590){#calibre_link-120 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}The
remainder of this section is a fairly technical discussion between Ejō
and Dōgen about the prohibitions of the [Brahmā Net Sutra]{.italice}.
Throughout the exchange, Ejō's questions follow a literal understanding
of the text, while Dōgen's answers are based on his own unique and much
freer interpretation. This discussion may have been part of Ejō's
preparation to have the precepts transmitted to him from Dōgen; this
precepts transmission is called [denkai]{.italice} (Jp.
[伝戒]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [傳戒]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"},
[chuánjiè]{.italice}), which happens shortly before Dharma transmission
([嗣法]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [sìfǎ]{.italice}; Jp.
[shihō]{.italice}) and is distinct from receiving the precepts at the
time of ordination. This tradition still exists today.

[[97](#calibre_link-591){#calibre_link-121 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}The
[Brahmā Net Sutra's]{.italice} forty-first minor precept says:

::: noteblock
If \[the one requesting precepts\] has broken one of the ten precepts,
you should teach him or her how to repent: they should go before an
image of a buddha or bodhisattva and recite the ten grave and
forty-eight minor precepts throughout the six periods of the day and
night. (Muller and Tanaka, [Brahmā's Net Sutra]{.italice}, 62)
:::

This would seem to suggest a precept can be broken even if it has not
yet been received, which is the thrust of Ejō's line of questioning.

[[98](#calibre_link-592){#calibre_link-122 .calibre2}
]{.ntspa}Repentance is a Buddhist practice that stretches back to India.
At a repentance ceremony (see note 42 from section 1-6), as well as at
the time of receiving the precepts at ordination, all unwholesome deeds
committed in the past are repented. Dōgen's teaching emphasizes the
power of sincere repentance, no matter what violation was committed or
when, as we see in this exchange with Ejō.

[[99](#calibre_link-593){#calibre_link-123 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}In the
beginning of the forty-second minor precept it is said, "My disciples,
you should not, with the intent of gaining some kind of personal
advantage, discuss the Mahāyāna precepts of the thousand buddhas before
those who have not yet received them, nor in front of evil
non-Buddhists" (Muller and Tanaka, [Brahmā's Net Sutra]{.italice}, 70).

[[100](#calibre_link-594){#calibre_link-124 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Ejō is
alluding to a section of the [Brahma Net Sutra]{.italice} about the
fifth minor precept. It reads, "My disciples, if you see any sentient
beings violating the eight precepts, the five precepts, or the ten
precepts, or who are defying the prohibitions by way of the seven
heinous acts or the eight difficult circumstances, or any other kind of
violation of the precepts, you should encourage them to repent" (Muller
and Tanaka, [Brahmā's Net Sutra]{.italice}, 49).

[[101](#calibre_link-595){#calibre_link-125 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Here
Dōgen is referring to the fortieth minor precept in the [Brahma
Net]{.italice} [Sutra]{.italice}. It states the following:

[]{#calibre_link-1390 .calibre2}

::: noteblock
When someone wishes to receive the precepts, the preceptor should
inquire, "In this life, have you ever committed one of the seven heinous
acts?" A bodhisattva preceptor should not confer the precepts on anyone
who has committed one of the seven heinous acts in this life. The seven
heinous acts are wounding a buddha, killing one's father or mother,
killing one's teacher, killing one's preceptor, disrupting the sangha,
and killing an arhat. If someone has committed any one of these seven
heinous acts, he or she cannot receive the precepts in this lifetime.
Anyone else can receive the precepts. (Muller and Tanaka, [Brahmā's Net
Sutra]{.italice}, 68)
:::

Despite the apparent finality of this precept, in Dōgen's interpretation
this is merely meant as a deterrent against someone committing these
offenses, and it should not actually disqualify someone from receiving
the precepts. Perhaps because in Dōgen's time Japan was a relatively
violent society run by a military government, Dōgen may have thought it
important to put strong emphasis on the forgiveness of past misdeeds.

[[102](#calibre_link-596){#calibre_link-126 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Evening
talk" translates [yawa]{.italice} ([夜話]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[yèhuà]{.italice}). These were informal talks given in the evening in
the abbot's chamber. At the time that this text was being recorded,
Dōgen's temple did not yet have a Dharma hall, and he therefore could
not give formal Dharma hall discourses ([上堂]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [shàngtáng]{.italice}; Jp. [jōdō]{.italice}).

[[103](#calibre_link-597){#calibre_link-127 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"To
scold" translates [kashaku]{.italice} ([呵嘖]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"};
Ch. [hēzé]{.italice}), a word used in Vinaya texts for the formal public
blaming and assignment of penalties to monks that had violated the
precepts. Here, Dōgen is not referring to this formal monastic practice,
but, instead, he is cautioning his senior monks regarding their
treatment of junior monks who may have misbehaved.

[[104](#calibre_link-598){#calibre_link-128 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Vinaya
texts state that four or five monks are the minimum required to form a
sangha, depending on the tradition. Saichō ([最澄]{.japaneese1

in which Dōgen first became a monk, wrote in the beginning of his
[Regulations for the Student of the Mountain Monastery]{.italice}
([山家学生式]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Sanke gakushō
shiki]{.italice}), "What is the treasure of the nation? Truly it is the

mind of awakening are national treasures."

[[105](#calibre_link-599){#calibre_link-129 .calibre2}
]{.ntspa}"Parental heart" is a translation of the Japanese expression
[rōbashin]{.italice} ([老婆心]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}), which
literally means "heart/mind of an old woman." Another translation might
be "grandmotherly heart." In Dōgen's [Instructions for the
Cook]{.italice} ([典座教訓]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Tenzo
kyōkun]{.italice}), he discusses three minds: joyful mind
([喜心]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [kishin]{.italice}), parental
mind ([老心]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [rōshin]{.italice}), and
magnanimous []{#calibre_link-1391 .calibre2}mind ([大心]{.japaneese1

"[Rōshin]{.italice} is the mind or attitude of a parent. In the same way
that a parent cares for an only child, keep the Three Treasures in your

My disciples, if there is a renunciant bodhisattva, a householder
bodhisattva, or a patron who wishes to invite a monk in order to gain
merit, then at the time of making the invitation he should go to the
monastery and speak to a monastery officer, saying, "I now wish \[to
make a request to invite a monk," to which the officer should respond,\]
"Invitations are distributed in order of seniority, which means that you
will be gaining access to all enlightened monks in the monastery." Even
though, \[as recounted in some scriptures,\] secular people gave private
invitations to the five hundred arhats and bodhisattva monks, this is
not as good as following the protocol of seniority and you may end up
with an unenlightened monk. Giving personal invitations to monks is a
custom of non-Buddhists. In the tradition of the Seven Buddhas there is
no such custom as giving personal invitations, and it does not accord
with the way of filial piety. If you intentionally make an invitation to
a monk, this constitutes a minor transgression of the precepts. (Muller

ancestors, from the outset, we should study and clarify this principle
of karma and its effects in the three periods of time. Otherwise, we
will fall into inverted views. Not only that, we will also fall into the

mundane human world. Typically, Zen teaching is understood to be going
beyond good and bad, but here Dōgen says even if we are acting based on
worldly or human sentiments, we should still refrain from unwholesome
acts and instead perform wholesome actions. Going beyond the dichotomy
of good and bad should never be understood to mean that it is acceptable
to act in an unwholesome way.

translates [ōgu]{.italice} ([応供]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[應供]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, [yīnggōng]{.italice}), which literally
means "worthy to receive offerings," and it is one of several Chinese
words that refers to an arhat. Here, Dōgen is specifically referring to
the Sixteen Arhats ([十六羅漢]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [shíliù
luóhàn]{.italice}; Jp. [jūroku rakan]{.italice}) who were asked by
Shakyamuni not to enter nirvana, in order to protect the Dharma and the
people who study and practice the Dharma, until the appearance of the
future Buddha Maitreya.

on in note 148 of section 3-2.

[[169](#calibre_link-663){#calibre_link-194 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}The text
here literally has "eight catties and half a tael"
([八両と半斤]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [hachiryō to
hankin]{.italice}). A tael is a measurement of weight equal to about
forty grams, and there are sixteen catties in one tael. These units are
still used for certain applications in the Chinese-speaking world. The
same expression is also still used in modern Chinese.

[[170](#calibre_link-664){#calibre_link-195 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}A famous
example of a small cause having a great result is a young boy's sincere
offering of sand to the Buddha that resulted in his later rebirth as the
great King Aśoka of the Mauryan dynasty. This story comes from the
[Chronicle of Aśoka]{.italice} ([阿育王傳]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"};
Ch. [Āyùwáng zhuàn]{.italice}; Jp. [Aikuō den]{.italice}). Dōgen
specifically cites this story elsewhere, for example, in the fascicle of
the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} entitled "The Bodhisattva's Four Embracing
Actions" ([菩提薩埵四摂法]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Bodaisatta
shishōbō"): "Offering sand, a child gained the throne. These people did
not covet rewards from others. They simply shared what they had
according to their ability" (Okumura, "28th Chapter of Shōbōgenzō," 11).

[[171](#calibre_link-665){#calibre_link-196 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}In this
passage, Dōgen is distinguishing the activities of laypeople and the
activities of monks, as well as the results of their respective
activities. He does not negate the notion that laypeople can receive
tangible benefits from giving to the Buddhist community, but he says
that this alone cannot cause people to awaken. Instead, only sincere
practice can do this.

[[172](#calibre_link-666){#calibre_link-197 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Dōgen
wrote an appeal letter in the twelfth lunar month of 1235 to raise funds
to construct the first formal monks' hall ([僧堂]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [sēngtáng]{.italice}; Jp. [sōdō]{.italice}) in Japan.
Construction was completed the next year. It is possible that the monks'
hall and the Dharma hall ([法堂]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[fǎtáng]{.italice}; Jp. [hattō]{.italice}) were built at the same time.
Dōgen gave the first formal Dharma hall discourse in the tenth month of
1236.

Sino-Japanese word [dōjō]{.italice} ([道場]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"};
Ch. [dàocháng]{.italice}) has entered the English language and refers to
a place where Japanese martial arts are practiced. []{#calibre_link-1400
.calibre2}Originally, however, it translated the Sanskrit
[bodhi-maṇḍa]{.italice}, the "place of awakening," referring to the
ground under the Bodhi Tree where the Buddha awakened. In
[Zuimonki]{.italice} it has the intermediate meaning of "place of
Buddhist practice."

[[174](#calibre_link-668){#calibre_link-199 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Kantō
([関東]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}) is a large flat area in eastern
Japan, dominated today by Tokyo and its suburbs. In this case, it refers
to the city of Kamakura, the seat of the shogunate that ruled Japan in
Dōgen's time. The person referred to in this passage encourages Dōgen to
go there and gain the support of powerful samurai in order to fund his
temple construction project. Many Buddhist masters, including Eisai,
moved to Kamakura to gain the support of the samurai class. Dōgen did
end up visiting Kamakura later on, from 1247 to 1248.

words" ([法語]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [fǎyǔ]{.italice}; Jp.

something about the Dharma and are usually delivered by an abbot.

[[176](#calibre_link-670){#calibre_link-201 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}As
mentioned previously, the [Selections]{.italice} [of Refined
Literature]{.italice} ([文選]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[Wénxuǎn]{.italice}; Jp. [Monzen]{.italice}) is a sixth-century Chinese
compilation of about seven hundred well-known poems and prose writings
by about 130 important writers. In Japan, this collection was regularly
studied as part of an aristocratic education. According to the [Record
of Kenzei]{.italice} ([建撕記]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Kenzei

Chinese poems when he was only four years old and continued to receive
the best education available at his time.

[[177](#calibre_link-671){#calibre_link-202 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}In
Menzan's version of the text there is an additional exchange before this
reply. To the first question, Dōgen replies, "I want to understand the
deeds of the ancients," after which the monk repeats the same question.

]{.ntspa}"Principle of mind" ([心の理]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp.
[shin]{.italice} [no ri]{.italice}) describes the nature of "mind" as it
is understood in East Asian Buddhism, but this mind should not be
confused with the human brain or the limited psychology of the
individual. In Dōgen's teaching, "mind" includes all beings in the here
and now, but it is not an abstract, unchanging, permanent thing like a
soul or an essence. In his "Talk on the Wholehearted Practice of the
Way" ([辨道話]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Bendōwa"), Dōgen
criticizes the notion of a permanent, unchanging mind, explaining that
all beings in the ever-changing phenomenal world are nothing other than
one mind ([一心]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [yīxīn]{.italice}; Jp.
[isshin]{.italice}).

([戒律儀]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [jièlǜyí]{.italice}; Skt.
[śīla-saṃvara]{.italice}). [Kai]{.italice} translates the Sanskrit word
[śīla]{.italice}, which means "morality." [Ritsugi]{.italice} was used
to translate [saṃvara]{.italice}, a word adapted into Buddhism
[]{#calibre_link-1401 .calibre2}from Jainism that means "restraint."
Together, they refer to the precepts that aim to prevent unvirtuous
deeds of body and speech.

[[180](#calibre_link-674){#calibre_link-205 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}These
various scriptural categories are explained in note 32 from section 1-4.

[[181](#calibre_link-675){#calibre_link-206 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}In
classical Chinese poetry, tones are often prescribed in a set structure
similar to meter, or rhythmic structure, in English poetry. In Chinese,
these structures are called [píngzè]{.italice} ([平仄]{.japaneese1

[[182](#calibre_link-676){#calibre_link-207 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Ku
Amidabutsu ([空阿弥陀仏]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}) is the name that the
monk Myōhen ([明]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}[遍]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; 1142--1224 CE) used to refer to himself after he became a
Pure Land Buddhist. He extensively studied both East Asian Mādhyamaka
([三論宗]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. Sānlùn-zōng; Jp. Sanron-shū)
and East Asian Esoteric Buddhism ([密教]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
Mìjiào; Jp. Mikkyō) and was an eminent scholar. Originally a monk of the
esoteric Shingon school headquartered on Mt. Kōya ([高野山]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}), he later became a student of Hōnen ([法然]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; 1133--1212 CE) and his Pure Land school (Ch.
[淨土宗]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. Jìngtǔ-zōng; Jp.
[浄土宗]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, Jōdo-shū), which is referred to as
the "Nenbutsu school" later in the text in reference to the school's
practice of [nenbutsu]{.italice} ([念仏]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[念佛]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, [niànfó]{.italice}), i.e., reciting
the name of the buddha Amitābha.

[[183](#calibre_link-677){#calibre_link-208 .calibre2}
]{.ntspa}"Renounced the world" here is [tonsei]{.italice}
([遁世]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [dùnshì]{.italice}), which
normally refers to the act of becoming a Buddhist monk. In this passage,
however, this phrase actually refers to him "renouncing" his Shingon
temple, which was part of the Buddhist establishment, in favor of a Pure
Land temple, which was not. For a broader discussion of this term, see
the introduction, pages 9--10.

[[184](#calibre_link-678){#calibre_link-209 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Formal
discourses" translates [jōdō]{.italice} ([上堂]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [shàngtáng]{.italice}), which literally means "ascend
the hall," probably referring to the abbot taking a high seat in the
Dharma hall before delivering the talk. Dōgen's formal discourses, also
loosely translated as "Dharma hall discourses," are collected in
[Dōgen's Extensive Record]{.italice} ([永平広録]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. [Eihei kōroku]{.italice}).

[[185](#calibre_link-679){#calibre_link-210 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}This
same phrase ("impermanence is swift and life-and-death is the great
matter") is also quoted in section 2-8; it is explained in note 113.

[[186](#calibre_link-680){#calibre_link-211 .calibre2}
]{.ntspa}[Nāgá]{.italice} ([龍]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[lóng]{.italice}; Jp. [ryū]{.italice}; literally "dragon" in
Sino-Japanese) is the Sanskrit word for a snake-like deity from ancient
Indian mythology. Nāgás were found in pre-Buddhist Indian traditions but
came to be one of the eight classes of deities who protect the Buddhist
faith. There are many specific nāgás discussed in Buddhist texts; in
East Asian Buddhism the "eight great dragon kings"
([八大龍王]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [bā dàlóng wáng]{.italice};
Jp. [hachi dairyū ō]{.italice}) are especially popular, for example.
Although originally conceived of as snake-like, when Buddhism traveled
to China, []{#calibre_link-1402 .calibre2}the nāgá was conflated with
preexisting dragon myths; thus, in East Asia they are generally thought
of as more dragon-like than snake-like.

[[187](#calibre_link-681){#calibre_link-212 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}As in
note 126, this is a quotation of Confucius from chapter 4 of his
[Analects]{.italice} ([論語]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[Lúnyǔ]{.italice}; Jp. [Rongo]{.italice}).

[[188](#calibre_link-682){#calibre_link-213 .calibre2}
]{.ntspa}"Repaying our debts of gratitude" translates
[hō'on]{.italice}[（報恩]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[bàoēn]{.italice}). [Hō]{.italice} means "repayment," and [on]{.italice}
means "kindness." The phrase can thus be translated as to "repay a
kindness" or, in this case, "repay a debt of gratitude."

[[189](#calibre_link-683){#calibre_link-214 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Filial
piety and obedience" is a translation of [kōjun]{.italice}
([孝順]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [xiàoshùn]{.italice}). Filial
piety is one of the most important virtues in Confucian thought in
China, Korea, and Japan. In the [Brahmā Net Sutra]{.italice}, which was
likely produced in China, we find the following: ". . . \[the Buddha's\]
first act was to establish the [Prātimokṣa]{.italice}, \[encouraging his
followers\] to piously obey their fathers and mothers, honored monks,
and the Three Treasures. Pious obedience is the principle of the
ultimate path" (Muller and Tanaka, [Brahmā's Net Sutra]{.italice}, 42).

[[190](#calibre_link-684){#calibre_link-215 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}The
[Classic of]{.italice} [Filial Piety]{.italice} (Ch. [孝經]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}, [Xiàojīng]{.italice}; Jp. [孝経]{.japaneese1
lang="ja-JP"}, [Kōkyō]{.italice}) mentioned here is one of the most
important Confucian texts. In it, Confucius insists that filial piety is
the foundation of all virtues and social morality.

[[191](#calibre_link-685){#calibre_link-216 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}As a
Buddhist term, "nondoing" (Ch. [無爲]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"},
[wúwéi]{.italice}; Jp. [無為]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"},
[mu'i]{.italice}) is a translation of the Sanskrit word
[asaṃskṛta]{.italice}, which means "unconditioned" and is usually
synonymous with nirvana. However, the Chinese compound was borrowed from
Daoism, where it already had the meaning of "effortless doing." In Zen
Buddhism, the Buddhist and Daoist concepts blended together. It does not
necessarily mean inactive; rather it means to act freely for the sake of
Dharma or all living beings---that is, without a narrow purpose, one
example of narrow purpose being when children make offerings exclusively
for their parents. Bodhidharma's "no merit" and Dōgen's
[shikan]{.italice} ([只管]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; "just doing")
refer to the same attitude.

[[192](#calibre_link-686){#calibre_link-217 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}In a
bodhisattva practice, we do not do things in order to get a good result
for us alone, but we vow to do beneficial things for the sake of the
awakening of all beings. In early Buddhism, it was believed that when
one chanted sutras, the individual received good karma from the
activity. In later Mahāyāna Buddhism, the notion of taking good karma
for oneself was rejected, and merit from the activity was instead always
dedicated to all beings or certain people in need.

[[193](#calibre_link-687){#calibre_link-218 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"The
period between death and rebirth" translates [chūin]{.italice}
([中陰]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [zhōngyīn]{.italice}), in turn, a
translation of the Sanskrit word [antarabhāva]{.italice},
[]{#calibre_link-1403 .calibre2}meaning "intermediate state" or
"transitional existence." The Tibetan term [bardo]{.italice} is more
commonly used in English than the Sino-Japanese or Sanskrit words. In
Mahāyāna Buddhism, the state is believed to last forty-nine days, during
which time meritorious activities performed by the deceased's family may
help the transitional being to be born in a better realm.

[[194](#calibre_link-688){#calibre_link-219 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}The
twentieth minor precept in the [Brahmā Net Sutra]{.italice} states, "On
the day of the death of your father, mother, or elder or younger
siblings you should request a Dharma teacher to deliver a lecture from
the [Bodhisattva Vinaya]{.italice} [Sutra]{.italice} in order to convey
blessings on the deceased that they may attain a vision of the buddhas
and be reborn as a human being or as a celestial" (Muller and Tanaka,
[Brahmā's Net Sutra]{.italice}, 55).

Zhōulìpántè; Jp. [周利槃特]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}, Shūrihandoku) was
one of the Buddha's disciples. He was dull-witted and unable to memorize
even one verse of teaching in four months. Shakyamuni Buddha gave him
the job of cleaning the monks' sandals, and this enabled him to attain
realization. In another version of the story, the Buddha instructed him
to sit facing east while repeating the phrase "cleaning off the dirt"
and wiping his face with a clean cloth. As Cūdapanthaka noticed the
cloth getting dirty from wiping off his sweat, he gained insight into
the reality of impermanence and immediately became an arhat.

[[196](#calibre_link-690){#calibre_link-221 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}This
refers to a famous story in which Nanyue Huairang
([南嶽懐譲]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Nangaku Ejō; 677--744 CE)
approaches his student Mazu Daoyi ([馬祖道一]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"};
Jp. Baso Dōitsu; 709--788 CE), who is sitting in zazen. Nanyue asks him
what he hopes to become by sitting zazen, and Mazu responds that he
intends to become a buddha. Nanyue then picks up a clay roof tile and
begins to attempt to polish it. When Mazu asks why he is doing so,
Nanyue says he intends to polish it into a mirror (a mirror being a
common Buddhist symbol for the Buddha's wisdom). Mazu asks how it is
possible to polish a tile into a mirror, and Nanyue, in turn, asks him
how it is possible to become a buddha by sitting zazen. Dōgen discusses
this story extensively in the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle entitled
"Acupuncture Needle of Zazen" ([坐禪箴]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"};
"Zazenshin").

[[197](#calibre_link-691){#calibre_link-222 .calibre2}
]{.ntspa}"Not-doing" is a translation of [fui]{.italice}
([不為]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [bùwéi]{.italice}). This is
essentially the same as the phrase [mu']{.italice}[i]{.italice}
discussed in note 191 in section 3-15.

[[198](#calibre_link-692){#calibre_link-223 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}"Self"
is capitalized here because it translates [jiko]{.italice}
([自己]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [zìjǐ]{.italice}), which Dōgen
consistently uses to denote the Self that includes all beings, not the
limited self or ātman of the ignorant individual.

([屈原]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Kutsugen; ca. 339--ca. 278 BCE)

states that Qu Yuan died in the Canglang River ([滄]{.japaneese1

[mahā-sukha]{.italice}, which in turn is usually equated with "nirvana."
See also note 305 in relation to section 6-2.

[[202](#calibre_link-696){#calibre_link-227 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}The

an emperor can only rule with the "mandate of heaven"
([天命]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [tiānmìng]{.italice}; Jp.

was seen as an indication that the mandate of heaven had been lost, and
the emperor could justifiably be overthrown.

[[203](#calibre_link-697){#calibre_link-228 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}In

"illuminated hall" ([照堂]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[zhàotáng]{.italice}; Jp. [shōdō]{.italice}) was a hall behind the
monks' hall where the head monk gave talks on behalf of the abbot. The
hall developed from what was originally a walkway between the monks'
hall and the washroom. It had a skylight in order to brighten it, hence
the name "illuminated hall." It seems that Rujing sometimes gave
informal talks in this hall.

[[208](#calibre_link-702){#calibre_link-233 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}The

said to have awakened after seeing peach blossoms in the spring, when he
realized the impermanence of all things. []{#calibre_link-1405
.calibre2}Xiangyan was said to have been a great scholar who had
memorized many Buddhist texts. He was asked to explain how things were,
from the perspective of when he was an infant unable to use language.
After being unable to find an answer in his books, he burned them all
and ceased studying texts. Later, while sweeping the grave of a Zen
master, he hit a piece of tile into a stalk of bamboo and attained
awakening upon hearing the sound that was produced. Dōgen also discusses
Lingyun and Xiangyan in the fascicle of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}

[[210](#calibre_link-704){#calibre_link-235 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Dōgen's
logic is essentially the opposite of the teaching schools: his logic is
that because we attain the Way with the body, the mind also attains the
Way. On this point, in the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "Zanmai ō
zanmai," Dōgen wrote, "Full lotus sitting is the straight body, the

[Jǐngdé]{.italice} [chuándēnglù]{.italice}; Jp.
[Keitokudentōroku]{.italice}). According to the story, while Tianran was
staying at a monastery, it was extremely cold, so he took a wooden
Buddha statue and burned it. When he was criticized, he claimed he was
doing so to obtain relics. When asked how this was possible, Tianran
said, "If it is not \[possible\], why do you blame me?" When Shakyamuni
passed away, people divided his relics into eight portions and housed
them in eight stupas in various regions. Visiting those stupas and

Buddhists.

First, following the midday meal, go to the offices of the prior and

become free from these delusions.

[[236](#calibre_link-730){#calibre_link-262 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}Although

as a model for ideal lay practice. Although Dōgen here says that Layman
Pang threw his family's possessions into the ocean, in the introduction
to his recorded sayings it states that he threw them into the Xiang

The sixty-two views are based on ego. When egocentric views arise, sit

substance of all things inside and outside your body? You received all
parts of your body from your mother and father. Your parents' red and
white droplets are empty and are in no way substantial. Therefore your
body is not "I." The mind and its functions, such as consciousness,
thoughts and knowledge, bind your life moment by moment while you are
alive. When inhaling and exhaling ceases, what on earth happens to your
mind? Therefore, the mind is not "I" either. You should not be attached
to your body or mind. A deluded person clings to body and mind, while an
awakened person is unattached. And yet, you assume the existence of the
ego though there is no ego, and you cling to life though it is unborn.
You should practice the Buddha Way, but you don't. You should cut off
worldly sentiments, but you don't. You dislike reality and seek after
illusions. How can you avoid mistakes? (Okumura, [Heart of

[Shinji]{.italice} [shōbōgenzō]{.italice}. The story goes that whenever
Juzhi was asked a question, he did not answer but instead just raised a
finger. One day, someone asked Juzhi's attendant about his master's
teaching, and the boy mimicked his master's action of raising a finger.
When Juzhi heard this, he cut off the boy's finger. The boy ran away
crying. Juzhi called after him, and when the boy turned his head, Juzhi
raised his finger. The boy suddenly attained realization.

Dharma hall discourse ([上堂]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.

tenth month in 1236, just a few weeks before Ejō became head monk

informal compared with [jōdō]{.italice}, and they still have elements of
formality. They are also distinct from the talks recorded in
[Zuimonki]{.italice} that Dōgen gave before the Dharma hall was

a question and answer session with the students. []{#calibre_link-1413

Dōgen said, "This informal meeting is \[where are given\] the family

great \[awakened\] dragons are not limited by \[the size of\] their

water from the river" is translated from [mizu ni aki]{.italice}
([水にあき]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}), but this phrase is difficult to
interpret in the Japanese. [Aki]{.italice} is from the verb
[aku]{.italice} ([飽く]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}), meaning "to get
tired of" or "to be satisfied," neither of which makes sense in this
context. Menzan's version instead has [kumo ni]{.italice}
[nemuri]{.italice} ([雲に眠り]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; "sleeping
under the clouds"), possibly representing his attempt to make sense of
it. To me, it seems what is meant here is likely the same as what Dōgen
wrote in the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle the "Mountains and Waters
Sutra" ([山水經]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Sansui kyō"): "From the

mountains have been the dwelling places of the great sages . . . since
ancient times, wise men and sages have also lived by the water"
(Okumura, [Mountains and Waters]{.italice} [Sutra]{.italice}, 32--34).

baskets" (Tripiṭaka), or categories, of the Buddhist scriptures, along
with the Sūtra Piṭaka and the Abhidharma Piṭaka. The Vinaya Piṭaka
includes the rules and regulations of monastic conduct. Each rule
includes a story about why it was created; therefore, the texts showcase
some of the worst behavior by early monks. There is, in fact, no
separate Mahāyāna version of the Vinaya Piṭaka despite what is suggested
here.

[[273](#calibre_link-767){#calibre_link-300 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}In early
Buddhism, the term [arhat]{.italice} meant "a worthy one" who has
destroyed all the afflictions and all causes for future rebirth and who
will thus enter nirvana upon death; in the [Lotus Sutra]{.italice}, all
arhats received a prediction from the Buddha that they would become
buddhas in the future. In the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice} fascicle "The
Arhat" ([阿羅漢]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Arakan"), Dōgen used
this word in the latter sense.

consider that the thinking and sensing mind that has not yet aroused the
mind of awakening is itself buddha." Later in the same fascicle, he
writes, "We clearly understand that the mind refers to the mountains,
rivers, and the great earth; the sun, the moon and the stars."

[[275](#calibre_link-769){#calibre_link-302 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}In
Buddhist scriptures, it is said that the Buddha has thirty-two major

([古佛心]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Kobusshin"), Dōgen quoted
Nanyang Huizhong's dialogue with a monk (see note 248 in section 5-1 for

[Mind]{.italice}, [Beginner's Mind]{.italice}. The book famously begins,
"In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, but in the

however, simply uses this expression synonymously with "beginner"
without the same positive valence.

translation for the Sanskrit [pariṇāmanā]{.italice}. It is typically
used in a Buddhist context to mean "transfer of merit," such as is done
during Mahāyāna Buddhist services when the merit gained from practice is
transferred to some other party or to all beings. The implication here
is that in dedicating ourselves to the Three Treasures, we must
completely give ourselves away.

Shang dynasty (ca. 1600--ca. 1046 BCE). Their father planned to make the
younger brother, Shuqi, his successor. Learning this, the elder brother,
Boyi, left home, but Shuqi did not want to push his elder brother out,
so he also left home. They both ended up living in the state of Zhou
([周]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}), which had begun planning to conquer
Shang. The king of Zhou consulted Boyi and Shuqi about his plans, and
they pleaded with him not to proceed. The king dismissed their petition.
The brothers then refused to eat grain produced in Zhou. They hid on
Shouyang Mountain ([首陽山]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. Shuyōzan),

Sino-Japanese as [azari]{.italice} or [ajari]{.italice}
([阿闍梨]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [āshélí]{.italice}). In
Sanskrit it simply meant a teacher or preceptor; ācārya was similar in
meaning to the Sanskrit [upādhyāya]{.italice}, which literally means
"preceptor." But in the Japanese Tendai and Shingon schools,
[]{#calibre_link-1422 .calibre2}it became a formal rank of the

Menzan's version reads:

::: noteblock
An ancient said, "Regarding properties and grain supplies that belong to
the monastery storage, let the officers who understand cause and result
administer the various tasks, dividing the monastery into departments
and distributing the work." This means that the abbot of the monastery
should not take charge of any major or minor matter whatsoever; rather
he should concentrate only on practicing zazen, teaching, and
encouraging the great assembly.

out of devotion to their practice, but the story of Dazu Huike (see note
262 in section 5-4), who cut off his arm to prove to his teacher
Bodhidharma the seriousness of his intention to practice, is one of the
most famous. The word "zealously" translates [shōjin]{.italice}
([精進]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [jīngjìn]{.italice}; Skt.
[vīrya]{.italice}), which is the fourth of the six perfections or
[pāramitās]{.italice}, where it is usually translated as "diligence" or
"effort." In modern Japanese it also appears in the word for Buddhist
vegetarian cuisine, [shōjin ryōri]{.italice} ([精進料理]{.japaneese1

[[352](#calibre_link-846){#calibre_link-380 .calibre2} ]{.ntspa}This
phrase begins with [go]{.italice} [sendai tō]{.italice}
([五闡提等]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}). There are two possible
interpretations: either "five [ṣaṇḍhilā]{.italice}" or "five
[icchantika]{.italice}." The five [ṣaṇḍhilā]{.italice} (usually
[五闡提羅]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [wǔ chǎntíluó]{.italice}; Jp.
[go sendaira]{.italice}) were five monks who claimed they had achieved
awakening in order to receive donations from laypeople. As a result,
they fell into hell and were later reborn as neutered males.
[Icchantika]{.italice} (usually [一闡提]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.
[yīchǎntí]{.italice}; Jp. [issendai]{.italice}; often abbreviated as
just [闡提]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}) are people who are supposed to
have forever lost the potential to attain awakening. Most Mahāyāna
Buddhists, probably including Dōgen, rejected this was a possibility, so
Dōgen would be using the phrase rhetorically if it is what he meant. The
difficulty in interpretation arises from the fact that the
"[ṣaṇḍhi]{.italice}" in [ṣaṇḍhilā]{.italice} and the
"[chanti]{.italice}" in [icchantika]{.italice} are transliterated with
the same Chinese characters ([闡提]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}). The
final character in the compound ([等]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}) is a
pluralizing suffix.

Sayings of Zhaozhou]{.italice} ([趙州錄]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch.

::: noteblock
A monk asked Zhaozhou, "I'm leaving for the south, and want to leave
with a little knowledge about the Buddha-Dharma. What about it?"

The master said, "You are leaving for the south. If you come to a place
where there is a Buddha, quickly move on. At a place where there is no
Buddha, do not tarry."

The monk said, "In that case, I am dependent on nothing."

The master said, "Willow catkins, willow catkins." (Green, [Recorded
Sayings]{.italice}, 96)

Willow catkins are ephemeral flowers that are pollinated by the wind,
emphasizing the need to not stay in one place.\

[mubutsu]{.italice}; Ch. [無佛]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"},
[wúfó]{.italice}) is hyphenated because it could be interpreted as "the
Buddha that is emptiness." Dōgen made at least two similar
interpretative moves: in the fascicle of the [Shōbōgenzō]{.italice}
entitled "The Dignified Conduct of the Practice-Buddha"
([行佛威儀]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Gyōbutsu-igi"), in which he
interprets the titular phrase as such instead of the standard
"practicing the Buddha's dignified conduct"; and in the fascicle
"Buddha-Nature" ([佛性]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Jp. "Busshō"), in
which he interprets the phrase "without Buddha-nature"
([無佛性]{.japaneese1 lang="ja-JP"}; Ch. [wú fóxìng]{.italice}; Jp. [mu
busshō]{.italice}) to mean "Buddha-nature is emptiness" (Nishijima and
