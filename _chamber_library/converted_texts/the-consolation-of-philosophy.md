##### THE CONSOLATION OF PHILOSOPHY {#aboutauthor.xhtml_con0000073 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

[ADVISORY EDITOR: BETTY RADICE]{.small}

[ANICIUS [BOETHIUS](#appendix002.xhtml_g20){#aboutauthor.xhtml_p20}]{.small} *(c*. [A.D]{.small}. 480--524), the Roman philosopher, has been called one of the last authentic representatives of the classical world, in both his life and writings. He came of a family which had held office in the decaying Western empire. He was Consul in 510, and a trusted political adviser to Theodoric, the Ostrogoth. Later he became involved in a conspiracy and was imprisoned and executed at Ravenna. The historical importance of his work was immense, because it was only through Boethius's translations that the knowledge of [Aristotle](#appendix002.xhtml_g16){#aboutauthor.xhtml_p16} survived in the West. He also wrote commentaries on [Cicero](#appendix002.xhtml_g38){#aboutauthor.xhtml_p38}, text-books on arithmetic and music, and a number of works on theology. His works were chosen for translation by Alfred the Great and he was one of the most influential Latin authors for the next thousand years.

[VICTOR WATTS]{.small} was born in 1938 and read classics and English at Merton College, Oxford, and did a year of postgraduate work at University College, London. He is Master of Grey College and part-time Senior Lecturer in the School of English at Durham University. His publications include articles and reviews and an edition of 'On trees and herbs', Book 17 of the medieval encyclopaedia *On the Properties of Thing* by Bartholomaeus Anglicus. He is Honorary Director of the English Place-Name Survey and editor of the *Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-names*.[]{#aboutauthor.xhtml_con0000077}

## Preface {#preface.xhtml_con0000080 .EB04MainHead}

The issue of a revised edition of the translation of *The Consolation of Philosophy* has enabled me to correct mistakes, improve the wording of one or two passages and take account of recent work on Boethius and his age. Since the first edition several important books have appeared. The commemoration of the fifteenth centenary of his birth in 1980 saw the appearance of two major contributions, *Boethius: The Consolations of Music, Logic, Theology and Philosophy* by Henry Chadwick, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1981, and *Boethius: His Life, Thought and Influence*, a collection of studies edited by Margaret Gibson, Basil Blackwell, Oxford 1981, including a fine literary analysis of the *Consolation* by Anna Crabbe. Boethius's literary structure and methods have also been exhaustively examined in J. Gruber's 'Kommentar zu Boethius De Consolatione Philosophiae', *Texte und Kommentare* 9, Berlin 1978, Seth Lerer's *Boethius and Dialogue: Literary Method in The Consolation of Philosophy*, Princeton, New Jersey 1985, and Gerard O'Daly's *The Poetry of Boethius*, Chapel Hill, University of North Carolina Press 1991, and his antecedents and influence by Pierre Courcelle in *La consolation de philosophie dans la tradition littèraire*, Paris 1976, in his article on Boethius in the *Dictionnaire de Lettres françcaises*, Le moyen âge, Paris 1964, and in Jamie Scott's *Christians and Tyrants: the prison testimonies of Boethius, Thomas More, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer*, New York 1995. Notable also are the entries on Boethius by L. Minio-Paluello in the *Encyclopaedia Britannica* (1968) and the *Dictionary of Scientific Biography II*, New York 1970 and the articles by S. F. Wiltshire, 'Boethius and the Summum Bonum' in *The Classical Journal* 67, 1972, and C. J. De Vogel 'The problem of philosophy and Christian faith in Boethius' in *Romanitas et Christianitas: Studia J. H. Waszink*, Amsterdam 1973.

[]{#preface.xhtml_con0000083}Our understanding of the relationship between Christianity and the pagan cultural background of the sixth century has become clearer since Henry Chadwick drew attention to the long tradition of Christian humanism which lies behind the *Consolation*. The link between the great senatorial families and the higher clergy in Rome was close, and so far from conversion entailing the rejection of pagan antiquity and custom it seems to have brought with it a positive attitude to the literature and thought of antiquity. Indeed, apart from the study of pagan philosophy, the editorial attention paid to classical authors such as [Virgil](#appendix002.xhtml_g142){#preface.xhtml_p142} and [Horace](#appendix002.xhtml_g69){#preface.xhtml_p69} and the care and restoration of ancient buildings, even originally pagan festivals such as the Luper-calia and the July games at Rome in honour of Apollo continued to be fully celebrated in Boethius's time. As Chadwick makes clear, this 'Christian love of the past, even when associated with some of the external forms of pagan ceremony, is of some importance as background for estimating the position of Boethius and his circle between classical culture and Christian belief'.[^1^](#preface-fn.xhtml_con0000255){#preface.xhtml_con0000084} This absence of tension between pagan and Christian tradition was able to foster a milieu in which the concept of the twofold approach to truth, one via the exercise of the reason, one via revelation, was natural and easy to maintain. The study of natural theology was in this context as valid as the study of revealed theology and it was to the former that throughout his life Boethius had devoted his formidable intellectual powers.

There is further a personal circumstance pointed out by Anna Crabbe which seems to go far to account for the absence of overt Christian reference in the *Consolation*. In contrast to [Augustine](#appendix002.xhtml_g18){#preface.xhtml_p18}, to whom it is now clear [Boethius](#appendix002.xhtml_g136){#preface.xhtml_p136}'s indebtedness was profound,[^2^](#preface-fn.xhtml_con0000257){#preface.xhtml_con0000086} the son of a pagan father, who came to conversion only as the result of passionate intellectual searching and painful emotional struggle, and whose work as a result shows a deep personal relationship with the []{#preface.xhtml_con0000087}God he discovered, Boethius was born into a Christian family, faced no such emotional turmoil or intellectual challenge and was able to devote his powers not to the discovery of a new religion but to the logical exposition of the theology that underpinned it. In the prison house during the last months of his life, so far from disillusion or apostasy, what he achieved was a brilliant summation of the moral and protreptic lessons of his life's intellectual work, in argument largely non-technical, adorned by literary and philosophical allusion drawn from a mind over many years immersed in the great writers of the classical past.

## [Introduction](#appendix002.xhtml_g1){#preface001.xhtml_p1} {#preface001.xhtml_con0000092 .EB04MainHead}

##### I. Introductory {#preface001.xhtml_con0000093 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

*The Consolation of Philosoph* has
been many things to many men. In a much quoted phrase Gibbon described it as
'a golden volume not unworthy of the leisure of Plato or [Tully](#appendix002.xhtml_g138){#preface001.xhtml_p138}', though he found its
philosophy ineffectual.
[^1^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000261){#preface001.xhtml_con0000095}
The Middle Ages did not find it so, and provided the *Consolation* with
a long series of translators, commentators and imitators. King Alfred turned it into
Old English for the education and enjoyment of his Anglo-Saxon subjects, and Chaucer
and John the Chaplain into Middle English; Notker Labeo and Peter von Kastl turned
it into medieval German, and Simun de Fraisne, Jean de Meung and others into Old
French. There were versions in Greek and Middle Dutch, in Old Provencal, in Italian
and in Spanish; later an English queen -- Elizabeth I -- turned
her hand to Englishing the *Consolation* and the tradition of translation
still continues, though most of us need rather longer than the twenty-four or
twenty-seven hours in which she is reputed to have completed her version.

Boethius stands at the crossroads of the
Classical and Medieval worlds. 'No philosopher,' wrote Richard
Morris, 'was so bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of Middle-Age
writers as Boethius. Take up what writer you will, and you find not only the
sentiments, but the very words of the distinguished old Roman.'
[^2^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000263){#preface001.xhtml_con0000097}
The extent and diffusion of Boethius' influence have been traced
elsewhere.
[^3^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000266){#preface001.xhtml_con0000098}

[]{#preface001.xhtml_con0000099}

In the case of the *Consolatio*
it was due, no doubt, to the fact that here Boethius was attempting something other
than a formal philosophical treatise. In the confines of prison he was no longer
concerned with the minute details and technicalities of argument, but with the
consolation to be gained from a broad and general philosophical meditation. In
retrospect, though I do not think this aspect of his work would have occurred to
Boethius himself, it is perhaps justified to regard him as 'the divine
popularizer'.
[^4^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000269){#preface001.xhtml_con0000101}

This popular quality was doubly
important. Firstly, along with the fact that Boethius was no mean poet, it made the
*Consolatio* available to the poets. In Britain it inspired the author of
*The Kingis Quai* to meditate on the wheel of Fortune and write his
remarkable little poem; while almost all the passages of philosophical reflection of
any length in the works of Chaucer can be traced to Boethius. And in Italy, to cite
only one other example, Dante set Boethius among the twelve lights in the heaven of
the Sun, calling him

> That joy who strips the
> world's hypocrisies\
> Bare to whoever heeds his cogent phrases:
> [^5^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000272){#preface001.xhtml_con0000104}

for along with Cicero's *De
Amicitia*, the words of Boethius, he tells us, provided him with his
greatest consolation after the death of Beatrice. The *Paradis* actually ends
with a reminiscence of Boethius' *caelo imperitans amor*.
--'the love that moves the sun and other stars'
[^6^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000274){#preface001.xhtml_con0000106}
-- and *The Divine Comed* as a whole could be regarded as a
great elaboration of Boethius' concept of the ascent of the soul to the
contemplation of the mind of God and its return to its true home *or patri*
in the scheme of the universe.

[]{#preface001.xhtml_con0000108}Secondly, the broad
scope and gentle tone of the *Consolatio* produced 'the book of
most serene and kindly wisdom that the Middle Ages knew'.
[^7^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000277){#preface001.xhtml_con0000109}
It was the book that 'saved the thought of the Middle
Ages', wrote W. P. Ker in his short but lucid account of Boethius.
[^8^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000280){#preface001.xhtml_con0000110}
'The beauty of it, which lifts it far above the ordinary run of
reflections on mortality, is that it restores a Platonic tradition, or even
something older and simpler in [Greek
philosophy](#appendix002.xhtml_g51){#preface001.xhtml_p51}, at a time when simplicity and clearness of thought were about to
be overwhelmed in the medieval confusion... His protection was always to be
had by anyone who found the divisions and distinctions of the schools too much for
him. In the *Consolation of Philosoph* there was a place of outlook from
which the less valuable matters sank back into their proper place, and the real
outlines of the world were brought into view... There can be little question
that Boethius, more than any other philosophic author, helped the great Schoolmen to
retain a general comprehensive view of the world as a whole, in spite of the
distractions of their minute inquiries.'

##### []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000112}II. Boethius' Life and Writings {#preface001.xhtml_con0000111 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius, born
in or about [AD]{.small} 480, was a member of an ancient and
aristocratic family, the *gens Anicia*. Since their conversion to
Christianity in the fourth century -- unusually early for an established
and conservative family -- the Anicii had risen to great power and wealth,
and among his ancestors and kinsmen, besides many consuls, Boethius could number two
emperors and a pope. His father himself had followed an honourable career of public
service, attaining to the consulship under the barbarian king [Odoacer](#appendix002.xhtml_g93){#preface001.xhtml_p93} in 487, but dying while his son was
still a boy.

Boethius was brought up in the home of
another patrician family, []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000115}that of the famous Quintus Aurelius
Memmius [Symmachus](#appendix002.xhtml_g129){#preface001.xhtml_p129}, consul in 485, and
later Prefect of Rome and Head of the Senate. It was Symmachus who introduced
Boethius to the worlds of literature and philosophy, and of him and of his daughter,
[Rusticiana](#appendix002.xhtml_g119){#preface001.xhtml_p119}, whom he later
married, Boethius speaks in the *Consolation* with reverence and
admiration.

According to his kinsman, [Ennodius](#appendix002.xhtml_g52){#preface001.xhtml_p52}, Boethius was something of an infant
prodigy and early showed an unusual passion for study. His education, whether at
Athens or not, was of the highest quality, and as a young man Boethius was master of
all the liberal arts, from rhetoric to logic and astronomy.
[^9^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000284){#preface001.xhtml_con0000117}

Both Ennodius and [Cassiodorus](#appendix002.xhtml_g32){#preface001.xhtml_p32} -- another kinsman of
Boethius and a cabinet-minister of Theodoric the Ostrogoth -- speak of
Boethius's eloquence, his perfection of style, and his perfect command of
Greek -- an accomplishment of growing rarity at the end of the fifth
century.

At an early age and in a manner unknown
to us, Boethius came to the notice of the great Ostrogothic king Theodoric who had
defeated Odoacer and murdered him in 493. Theodoric, in the most flattering terms,
commissioned him to construct a water clock and sundial for [Gundobad](#appendix002.xhtml_g63){#preface001.xhtml_p63}, king of the [Burgundians](#appendix002.xhtml_g23){#preface001.xhtml_p23}, and to choose a lyre player for [Clovis](#appendix002.xhtml_g41){#preface001.xhtml_p41}, king of the [Franks](#appendix002.xhtml_g60){#preface001.xhtml_p60}.
[^10^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000286){#preface001.xhtml_con0000120}
He was also employed to investigate a case of alleged debasement of the coinage
by the paymaster of the life-guards, and in 510 he was made consul without
companion. Thus at the age of thirty he held what was traditionally the most
illustrious of all the Roman offices -- dignities denied to the majority of
men at any age
[^11^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000288){#preface001.xhtml_con0000121}
-- although in the days of Theodoric the consulate was of little more
than titular importance.

Later -- the year is not known
-- Theodoric made him *magiste*. []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000123}*officiorum*, a position which involved him in onerous and responsible
duties. He became head of the whole civil service and chief of the palace officials.
And then in 522 came the moment which Boethius still regarded even in prison as the
hour of his greatest happiness, the day when his two boys were appointed consuls
together. It was a unique honour accorded to the father and implies his joint
recognition by both Theodoric and the Emperor in Constantinople.

The years immediately following his own
consulship are obscure. But it is during this period that he must have pursued the
studies he had begun in the house of Symmachus, for the duties of *magister
officiorum*, involving, as they must have done, prolonged absences from Rome
at the court in [Verona](#appendix002.xhtml_g140){#preface001.xhtml_p140} or [Ravenna](#appendix002.xhtml_g116){#preface001.xhtml_p116}, would have parted him from
his library and allowed him little time for his impassioned pursuit of the
philosophy which he considered his *summum vitae solamen* his chief solace in
life.
[^12^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000291){#preface001.xhtml_con0000125}

It was not in the forefront of public
life but in the study and treatment of all the branches of philosophy that
Boethius' true calling lay. And he pursued this aim with a single-minded
dedication and methodical steadfastness which only the recollection of his childhood
precocity renders less than astounding. It is here that the real Boethius is
clearest to view, the scholarly character, the calm almost leisured approach to his
self-appointed task. It was not the retreat of an escapist from the acute feeling of
the insignificance of the once proud offices of the Roman state, but the deliberate
plan of the dedicated student to give his fellow countrymen the basis they still
lacked for a truly scholarly study of philosophy. 'Boethius saw
himself,' Campenhausen writes, 'as the schoolmaster of the
West.'
[^13^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000293){#preface001.xhtml_con0000127}

I wish \[Boethius says\] to
translate the whole work of Aristotle, so far as it is accessible to me, into the
Roman idiom and conscientiously offer his []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000129}complete utterances in
the Latin tongue. Everything Aristotle ever wrote on the difficult art of logic, on
the important realm of moral experience, and on the exact comprehension of natural
objects, I shall translate in the correct order. Moreover, I shall make all this
comprehensible by interpretative explanations. I should also like to translate all
Plato's Dialogues, and likewise explain them, and thus present them in a
Latin version. When this is accomplished, I will furthermore not shrink from proving
that the Aristotelian and Platonic conceptions in every way harmonize, and do not,
as is widely supposed, completely contradict each other. I will show, moreover, that
they are in agreement with one another at the philosophically decisive points. This
is the task to which I will dedicate myself, so far as life and leisure for work are
vouchsafed to me. I know that this will be as useful as it is laborious, and that it
needs the assistance of those powers which are ever alien to envy and jealousy.
[^14^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000296){#preface001.xhtml_con0000130}

Boethius did not fulfil his plan, but he
did finish translations of [Porphyry](#appendix002.xhtml_g111){#preface001.xhtml_p111}'s *Introduction to the Categories of Aristotl*.
-- to serve as a student's introduction -- and
Aristotle's works on logic. These included the *De
Interpretatione*, the *Topics*, the *Prio*, and *Posterior
Analytic*, and the *Sophistical Fallacies*, and it is clear that he
also knew Aristotle's *Metaphysics, Physics, De Generatione et
Corruptione, De Anim* and *Poetics*. Furthermore he wrote
commentaries on Porphyry's *Introduction*, on probably all the
works of Aristotle that he translated, and on Cicero's *Topics*.
But his philosophical work was not entirely one of transmission: he also wrote five
independent works of his own on logic.

The historical importance of all this
work was immense, because it was only through Boethius's translations of
his logic that the knowledge of Aristotle survived in the West. By his careful
literal translation of philosophical terms Boethius created a new philosophical
vocabulary for the medieval schoolmen. And in his commentaries []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000133}he offered them a model for their own commentaries on Aristotle. The great
medieval debate between Nominalists and [Realists](#appendix002.xhtml_g117){#preface001.xhtml_p117} has its seeds in a passage in Boethius' commentary on
Porphyry. 'The last of the Romans; the first of the
scholastics':
[^15^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000299){#preface001.xhtml_con0000134}
the formula summarizes Boethius's position as the channel through
whose precise and organized systematization philosophy passed from the ancient world
to the academic discussions of Scholasticism.

The liberal arts, too, had value for
him, as for St Augustine, as a propaedeutic to philosophy. Consequently he wrote
treatises -- or rather translations of treatises -- on arithmetic,
on geometry and possibly on astronomy and mechanics. These were important in the
development of medieval education; his treatise on music, for instance, remained a
textbook at Oxford until the eighteenth century. Boethius also gave us the word
*quadrivium*, believing that 'it was impossible to achieve the
summit of perfection in the disciplines of philosophy unless one approached this
noble wisdom by a kind of fourfold way.'
[^16^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000301){#preface001.xhtml_con0000136}

He is also accredited with five small
works or tractates of theology, the authenticity of at least four of which is beyond
doubt. They are completely orthodox in doctrine and are important as representing
the attempt of a philosopher primarily interested in logic to apply the methods of
philosophy to the support of a body of revealed truth which exists in its own right.
In his application of logical methods and the terminology of Aristotle to
theological problems Boethius clearly stands out again as a forerunner of the
scholastics.

All this activity forms the intellectual
background of his last great work, the work for which above all else he is
remembered. And yet it is surrounded by question marks. What were the circumstances
of its composition? Why did the trustedright-hand servant of Theodoric fall so
abruptly from power? Was Boethius a Christian, and if so why does the
*Consolatio* lack all reference to the faith that should []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000139}have been his greatest consolation in the hours of imprisonment
and pending death?

Only one of these questions can be
answered with certainty. Since the authorship of the *Theological Tractates*
-- with perhaps one exception -- is unimpeachable, and since in
any case it would have been impossible for an overt pagan to have risen so high in
public life in the early sixth century, scholarship is satisfied that Boethius must
have been a Christian. But while the fact of his Christianity cannot be doubted, its
quality is still a matter on which there is disagreement. And while the historical
facts surrounding his downfall are beyond recall, from Boethius' own words
and the testimonies of the times a hypothesis can be constructed.
[^17^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000304){#preface001.xhtml_con0000141}

It must be remembered that since the
beginning of the fourth century the Roman Empire had been provided with an Eastern
capital at Constantinople, and that since the end of that century it had been
governed by the joint rule of a Western and an Eastern emperor. In 476 the barbarian
Odoacer deposed the last emperor of the West and sent the Imperial Insignia to
Constantinople; in barbarian eyes only a Roman could assume the purple, and Odoacer
seems to have been content to preserve the imperial administration in Rome and
recognize the Eastern [Zeno](#appendix002.xhtml_g143){#preface001.xhtml_p143} as sole
emperor, in return for the title 'Patricius'.

Thus a loose *modus vivend* was
established between the barbarians and the emperor. In practice Odoacer was an
autonomous king; but in theory -- and in Roman eyes -- he was
regarded as a kind of Viceroy, a servant of the Emperor at Constantinople in a
single unified Empire. This system was preserved by [Theodoric](#appendix002.xhtml_g132){#preface001.xhtml_p132}, king of the [Ostrogoths](#appendix002.xhtml_g97){#preface001.xhtml_p97}, when he succeeded Odoacer in 493.
To the emperor []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000144}[Anastasius](#appendix002.xhtml_g10){#preface001.xhtml_p10} he wrote: 'Our royalty is an imitation of yours, a
copy of the only Empire on earth.'
[^18^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000307){#preface001.xhtml_con0000145}

A great military leader of a barbaric
people, yet educated in the sophisticated circles of the court at Constantinople,
Theodoric had all the qualities to impose a firm and peaceful rule upon Italy. Both
king of the barbarians and Viceroy of the emperor, he succeeded in establishing the
peaceful coexistence of Roman and Goth. The administration was carried on by the
Roman civil service, but it was directed by Theodoric's strong and
vigorous guidance. To his service he was able to attract Romans of the calibre of [Liberius](#appendix002.xhtml_g78){#preface001.xhtml_p78}, Cassiodorus andBoethius.
Industry prospered, peace reigned, buildings and aqueducts were restored and
rebuilt. And the success of Theodoric's rule at home was mirrored by his
increasing prestige abroad.

In matters of religion Theodoric was a
Christian, but an Arian, a member, like all the Goths, of that heretical sect which
believed that the Father and the Son were not 'one substance'.
This heresy had split the church, and yet Theodoric found no difficulty in ruling in
the city of the Pope and the capital of orthodoxy. He firmly supported complete
freedom of worship for all -- except pagans -- and remained on
friendly terms with the orthodox clergy, on one occasion even being invited to
arbitrate in a disputed papal election. For the moment the seeds of future suspicion
and hostility were dormant.

Boethius's decision to serve
as Theodoric's minister involved him, as we have seen, in considerable
self-sacrifice. Like Symmachus --himself a scholar with a thorough command
of Greek, a writer of history, and a brilliant speaker, a man who though he had
served the barbarian overlords preserved a certain aloofness and reserve towards
them -- Boethius too would have preferred a life of study among his books.
His decision to enter real politics was dictated by a sense of duty rather than a
desire for fame. From his own words we learn that the Platonic ideal of the state
governed by philosophers []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000149}was his inspiration
[^19^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000310){#preface001.xhtml_con0000150}
and the lessons of philosophy his guide in the exercise of his offices.
[^20^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000312){#preface001.xhtml_con0000151}

Given such principles of conduct and
such disinterested moral rectitude, and given the animosities, the suspicions and
deceits, the intrigue and self aggrandizement encountered in political life, it was
impossible that Boethius should not make enemies. At first he was successful in
opposing Gothic rapaciousness and enjoyed Theodoric's support.
[^21^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000314){#preface001.xhtml_con0000153}
But these external circumstances were to change.

In 484 there had been a doctrinal breach
between East and West, known, because of the Pope's condemnation of the
Byzantine Patriarch [Acacius](#appendix002.xhtml_g2){#preface001.xhtml_p2}, as the
Acacian schism. Insofar as it strengthened his independence of the East, the
hostility of the Pope and Italian clergy to Constantinople was not unwelcome to
Theodoric; but to those who held the unity of the Empire dear -- and this
seems to have included the circle around Symmachus to which Boethius and many of the
senators belonged and which continuously looked to the East -- the breach
was deplorable. It is not unlikely that, although as far as can be seen Boethius
remained aloof from the battles of ecclesiastical controversy, his theological
tractates were meant in some sort as a modest contribution towards solving the
dispute. The breach in fact was officially healed in 519 although the controversy
did not end at once. Boethius sided with the East and the honour done to him in 522
was perhaps originally proposed by the Emperor at the bidding of a kinswoman of
Boethius resident in Constantinople.

The end of the schism and its aftermath
had political as well as theological implications. Not only had the Senate been
openly appealed to, but the rapprochement between East and West threatened
Theodoric's position: in Roman eyes their true lord was once again the
orthodox Emperor, while Theodoric remained an invader and a heretic.

[]{#preface001.xhtml_con0000156}

The combination of circumstances led
inevitably to Boethius' downfall; he was a man of principle, not a
politician, and his sympathies were firmly on the side of the Empire and its culture
rather than with the Gothicizing circle of [Cyprian](#appendix002.xhtml_g45){#preface001.xhtml_p45}. In the jungle of court corruption the time was ripe for his enemy
to play upon the already aroused suspicions of the king who had been further
incensed by the renewed persecution of Arians in the East.
[^22^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000317){#preface001.xhtml_con0000158}
Letters to Constantinople were intercepted in which a senator named [Albinus](#appendix002.xhtml_g7){#preface001.xhtml_p7} appears to have expressed himself
indiscreetly in some way, perhaps in connexion with the recent election of the
pro-Eastern Pope [John I](#appendix002.xhtml_g75){#preface001.xhtml_p75}: and when
Boethius tried to dismiss the matter, evidence -- whether false, as
Boethius claims, or not, we do not know --was produced to implicate him
with the added -- perhaps rather desperate -- charge of sorcery.
Was he not the man who had striven against the Goths Conigast and Triguilla and
himself written against the Arian heresy?
[^23^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000319){#preface001.xhtml_con0000159}
Within a short while he was arrested, condemned and sent into exile to await
execution. The senate, overawed by an aging, disillusioned and suspicious Theodoric,
confirmed the sentence and after being cruelly tortured Boethius was bludgeoned to
death at Pavia, the place of his exile, in 524 or 525.

The truth of his case will never be
known. Boethius's allegiance to the Roman Imperial idea may have seemed
consistent to him with his service of the Gothic king; but seen through barbarian
eyes it could understandably be viewed as treason. Atanyrate, Theodoric's
revenge extended after Boethius's death to include Symmachus and the Pope
as well, and before he died old and embittered in 526 his whole policy of peaceful
coexistence lay in ruins. Along with it the Roman aristocracy, the proud and ancient
offices of state and the whole study of philosophy virtually disappeared, until the
latter was []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000161}rediscovered, long after the attack of [Justinian](#appendix002.xhtml_g76){#preface001.xhtml_p76} and the invasion of the [Lombards](#appendix002.xhtml_g79){#preface001.xhtml_p79}, by the ninth-century Carolingian
renaissance.

On 15 December 1883 the Sacred
Congregation of Rites in Rome in concert with the Bishop of Pavia approved the local
cult of St Severinus Boethius. The cult is as old at least as the ninth though not
popular until the thirteenth century when Dante knew of Boethius' resting
place in the church of San Pietro in Cielo d'Oro in Pavia. Peter Abelard
and the Middle Ages may have been right to venerate Boethius along with Symmachus
and Pope John as orthodox martyrs of [Arianism](#appendix002.xhtml_g15){#preface001.xhtml_p15}, but the modern view tends to regard this as too great an
oversimplification.

##### The Consolation of Philosophy {#preface001.xhtml_con0000163 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

Between his condemnation and his
execution there was a period of delay during which Boethius was imprisoned at Pavia.
The conditions of this imprisonment we do not know, but he had sufficient freedom to
meditate on and write the *Consolation*. Some have thought that he must have
had access to his books in the writing; but the many casual references,
recollections and quotations scattered throughout the work -- not only from
philosophers, but also from the great literary figures like [Catullus](#appendix002.xhtml_g34){#preface001.xhtml_p34}, [Claudian](#appendix002.xhtml_g40){#preface001.xhtml_p40}, [Euripides](#appendix002.xhtml_g57){#preface001.xhtml_p57}, [Homer](#appendix002.xhtml_g68){#preface001.xhtml_p68}, [Juvenal](#appendix002.xhtml_g77){#preface001.xhtml_p77}, [Lucan](#appendix002.xhtml_g80){#preface001.xhtml_p80}, [Menander](#appendix002.xhtml_g83){#preface001.xhtml_p83}, [Ovid](#appendix002.xhtml_g98){#preface001.xhtml_p98}, [Seneca](#appendix002.xhtml_g121){#preface001.xhtml_p121} (especially his Tragedies), [Sophocles](#appendix002.xhtml_g124){#preface001.xhtml_p124}, [Statius](#appendix002.xhtml_g126){#preface001.xhtml_p126} and Virgil -- are scarcely
matters for wonder in a man whose youth was devoted to avid reading and in an age
when the memory was commonly keener and more retentive than in our own.

We must, then, in the absence of firm
evidence to the contrary, believe Boethius that he wrote in prison, alone, under the
shadow of eventual execution, unaided except by the power of his own memory and
genius.

In form the *Consolation* belongs
to the ancient genre of the *consolatio*, a branch of the diatribe which in
pagan [Greece](#appendix002.xhtml_g3){#preface001.xhtml_p3} and Rome []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000167}was especially the province of philosophy. It was cultivated by all the schools of
philosophy, and by the time of Seneca the science of *consolati* had become,
in the words of J. Martha,
[^24^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000322){#preface001.xhtml_con0000168}
'a kind of moral medication... It was only necessary to open
the drawer corresponding to the illness in question in order to find at once the
remedies most appropriate for a cure.' This is the source of the extended
medical metaphor used by Philosophy and of the diagnosis of the true nature of
Boethius's sickness in Book I. It is the source too of the examination of
Fortune, of the use of historical examples, and of the popular eclectic philosophy
of commonplace *solaci* which underlies a good deal of Book II and which
includes the memorable passage of prose which demonstrates, after the manner of
Cicero in the *Dream of Scipio*, how trivial and provincial earthly fame and
glory are.
[^25^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000325){#preface001.xhtml_con0000169}

But the *Consolatio* is a skilled
fusion of more than one genre. In part it approximates to the monologue, and in part
it imitates the dialectic of the Platonic dialogue. The whole, in fact, is cast in
the form of a particular type of dialogue, the sacred dialogue, in which the author
describes how some divine spirit or power, at first unknown to him, appears and
reveals to him some portion of hidden wisdom, as, for instance, in the second book
of Esdras in the Apocrypha, ch. 3 ff.

The combination of apocalyptic dialogue
and Menippean Satire -- a form of composition, Greek in origin and later
latinized, in which sections of prose alternate with verse --
[^26^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000327){#preface001.xhtml_con0000172}
was already in existence before Boethius wrote. The most famous example was [Martianus Capella](#appendix002.xhtml_g82){#preface001.xhtml_p82}'s
extraordinary *Marriage of Philology and Mercury*: the knowledge of this book
may not have offered Boethius much help, but []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000173}it may have been
the inspiration for his choice of the literary form which he raised to greater
heights than it had ever before achieved.

In the *Consolation*, then, there
is a skilful combination of varied literary forms. And a similar, or greater
exhibition of literary skill is displayed in the thirty-nine poems which intersperse
and enliven the discourse. Their presence is integral and their purpose varied. They
act as a relief from the concentration of the argument while the patient is still
weak; but as he grows stronger and the argument more complex, their occurrence is
less frequent. (It is not by accident that the *Consolation* begins with
verse and ends with prose.) Sometimes they are used to summarize or even advance the
discussion. And sometimes their function is not unlike that of the chorus in a Greek
tragedy, offering a gnomic comment and lending distance and perspective to the
intense and personal progress of the dialogue.

There have been varying opinions of
their poetic merit. A ninth-century writer thought that Boethius was the equal of
Cicero in his prose and of Virgil in his poetry, and the great Scaliger considered
the poetry divine.
[^27^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000330){#preface001.xhtml_con0000176}
On the other hand Hermann Usener saw in the metrical interludes the voice of a
child of the sixth century compared with the maturity of the proses, and to W. P.
Ker 'the verse of the *Consolation* is that of a prosodist
-- somewhat too deliberate in the choice and combination of metres, not
always quite successful, it may be thought.'
[^28^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000332){#preface001.xhtml_con0000177}
Granted that some of the poems are clever without being distinguished, not a
few rise to greater heights: I, 5 was already set to music by the ninth century; II,
7 contains the famous reference to the bones of [Fabricius](#appendix002.xhtml_g59){#preface001.xhtml_p59}; Books III and IV contain a number of
good poems including the fine retelling of the story of [Orpheus](#appendix002.xhtml_g96){#preface001.xhtml_p96} and []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000178}[Eurydice](#appendix002.xhtml_g58){#preface001.xhtml_p58}; and no one can fail to be moved by
the majestic and magistral poetry of the ninth poem of Book III. This was so famous
in the Middle Ages for the reasons given in the note on page 67 that it had its own
special commentaries written by Bruno of Corvey and Adalbold of Utrecht. In his
prose style, too, Boethius is considerably superior in his simplicity and restraint
to the usual elaboration and diffuseness of the prose writers of the time.

> In one of his commentaries on
> Porphyry, Boethius wrote:

This love of wisdom (or philosophy) is
the illumination of the intelligent mind by that pure wisdom (defined as the
self-sufficient living mind and sole primaeval reason of all things), and is a kind
of return and recall to it, so that it seems at once the pursuit of wisdom, the
pursuit of divinity and the friendship of that pure mind. So that this wisdom gives
to the whole class of minds the reward of its own divinity and returns it to its
proper constitution and purity of nature.
[^29^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000335){#preface001.xhtml_con0000181}

Herein lies the philosophical basis of
the *Consolation*. Philosophy descends to Boethius from on high (I, 3) and
leads him back through various paths to God Himself. Her varying height in I, 1 is
symbolic: sometimes she is of average height offering the practical philosophy of
Book II; sometimes she pierces the sky leading back to God from Whom she came.

The scheme is undoubtedly Platonic. The
turning of the gaze from what is false to what is true (III, 1) and the realization
that God is the supreme good (III, 10) is based on the ascent of the soul in the
famous allegory of the Cave in the seventh book of the *Republic*. The ascent
or education of the soul is like the ascent of a man from a dark cave in which he
has been chained since childhood, unable to see more than shadows on the wall. When
he is freed he is brought []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000184}step by step up into the light until
he is eventually able to see the sun itself, the Idea of the Good.

But the ascent of the soul is not simply
a process of education, it is also one of remembering: and the Platonic basis of the
*Consolation* is seen again in the reference to this doctrine *of
anamnesi* or recollection in poem **2**of Book III.
[^30^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000339){#preface001.xhtml_con0000186}
Here we find a Neoplatonic fusion of concepts not formally associated by [Plato](#appendix002.xhtml_g107){#preface001.xhtml_p107}: the ascent of the soul is
connected with the doctrine of recollection, and both are seen in terms of the
turning in upon itself of the soul and its illumination by its own inward light.

The notion of recollection underlies the
whole of Book III. Already in chapter 6 of Book I Boethius's condition is
diagnosed as due to the loss of the memory of his true nature. His mind dreams of
true happiness (III, 1), but like other men his memory is clouded (III, 2). For
there is a natural attraction of the soul to the Good, but it is frequently
deflected and frustrated along false byways.
[^31^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000342){#preface001.xhtml_con0000188}
When, however, Boethius has been brought to the point at which he is ready to
turn away from what is false to what is true, the recollection and the ascent which
is prayed for in the ninth poem of Book III seem almost to be accomplished by poetic
uplift and anticipation in the sublime closing lines of that poem.
[^32^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000344){#preface001.xhtml_con0000189}
By the end of the Book prose draws level with poetry again and Philosophy has
shown the true nature of God, though not without a hint in the Orpheus allegory that
Boethius may yet lapse into error.

The *Consolation of Philosophy*
was written in prison, and, as E. K. Rand has observed, prison-literature often
takes the form of a theodicy, an attempt to

>       assert eternal
> Providence
>
> And Justify the ways of God to
> men.

[]{#preface001.xhtml_con0000193}

We might compare, for instance, Sir
Thomas More's *Dialogue of Cumfort against Tribulation*, also
written in prison and under the threat of execution. So Boethius's bitter
experiences led him into a reconsideration of the nature of happiness. The method he
uses is that of Platonic dialectic, the diction and conventions of which he
carefully imitates,
[^33^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000347){#preface001.xhtml_con0000195}
though the substance of the argument is drawn from a different source, perhaps
from St Augustine.
[^34^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000349){#preface001.xhtml_con0000196}
To the modern reader this use of dialectic will probably seem the least
successful part of the *Consolation*. This is because it tends to treat words
as if they had an unchanging value like the symbols of algebra or logic. For this
reason the argument at the end of Book III that 'evil is
nothing' on the grounds that 'God who can do all things cannot
do evil' and that 'what God cannot do is nothing', and
the further conclusion that evil men are powerless, will fail to convince. It
contains, however, the seeds of further discussion in Book IV.

This Book is what Campenhausen calls
'a detailed theodicy developed in the Platonic spirit'.
[^35^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000352){#preface001.xhtml_con0000198}
The first part concerning the strength of the good and weakness of the bad and
their rewards and punishment, including the idea that criminals should be treated as
sick men, is based on Plato's *Gorgias*. The second part, in answer
to Boethius's hesitations concerning the nature of God's control
of the universe, involves Philosophy in a fresh beginning.

Thus chapter 6 marks the end of Socratic
dialogue and rhetorical embellishment, the end of Boethius's dependence on
Plato and the advance to a higher plane of argument, viz. the exposition of the two
aspects of history as Providence -- the simple unchanging plan in the mind
of God -- and Fate -- the ever changing distribution in and
through time of all the events God has planned in his simplicity. Boethius appears
to have combined two ideas; the idea of a mutable Fate governing and revolving all
things, which he read of in the []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000200}treatise *On Providence and
Fat* by the fifth-century Neoplatonist [Proclus](#appendix002.xhtml_g112){#preface001.xhtml_p112}, and the idea, already touched on at
the end of Book III chapter **12**, of God as the 'still
point of the turning world', an idea he found in the philosophy of [Plotinus](#appendix002.xhtml_g108){#preface001.xhtml_p108}. The union of the two ideas
is perfect. The more the soul frees itself from corporeal things, and thus,
according to both Proclus and Plotinus, from Fate,
[^36^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000355){#preface001.xhtml_con0000201}
the closer it approaches the stability and simplicity of the place of rest at
the centre, which according to Plotinus is God, the hinge of things, or Providence,
the source of freedom and consolation for Boethius. This is a brilliant example of
what H. R. Patch calls Boethius's 'inspired
eclecticism', the skill with which he blends received material from
various sources to form a new and harmonious whole.
[^37^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000357){#preface001.xhtml_con0000202}

The poem which follows celebrates in
verse the truth which has just been proclaimed, God's benevolent
government of the universe, for the question of the presence of evil in the world
has its solution in the vision of divine peace. This theme occurs in a number of
poems which deal with the problem of how the universe is constituted and offer a
generally Platonic answer. First in Book I poem 5 Boethius praises God's
government of the universe, but asks why it is withheld from human affairs and why
men are subject to the whims of Fortune. He concludes with a prayer which seems to
echo the 'Thy will be done in earth as in heaven' of the
Lord's Prayer. Then in the last poem of Book II, Philosophy sings of the
power of love in the natural world preserving peace and keeping chaos at bay. She
answers Boethius by specifically saying that God's government does include
human affairs: love makes peace between nations, blesses marriage and cements
friendship. But she also implies that man can rebel against this love and alienate
himself from the scheme of things. It was in this way that Boethius lost his way by
means of a perverse []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000204}love, but there is a hint of a promise that
by love he will be brought back again to his true home.

Book III poem 9 continues the theme of
God's government and control of the universe, which now finds its fullest
treatment here in Book IV poem 6. The poem begins, like the first two of the group,
with the description of the eternal peace of the heavens brought about by love.
Echoing Book III poem 9 and the *Timaeus*, Philosophy moves on to the concord
of the elements, of the seasons, and of birth and death, which includes mankind, and
associates human affairs with the cosmic power of love. This leads her on to the
author of this love, who stabilizes the universe by means of the triple movement of
the Neoplatonists, away from God, turning, and coming back to Him.

In his emphasis on peace and on love,
Boethius's commentators have seen a turning away from purely philosophical
expression to something more akin to the writing of Christian authors like [Pseudo-Dionysius](#appendix002.xhtml_g113){#preface001.xhtml_p113} and St Augustine.
'These poems have a temper and colouring that harmonises with the
Christianity of their author.'
[^38^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000361){#preface001.xhtml_con0000207}
Whether this is so, or whether this is only the philosophical expression of an
idea which goes back to the Love of Empedocles,
[^39^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000363){#preface001.xhtml_con0000208}
these metres were certainly influential in later times; here are seeds of the
thought of Dante (e.g. Beatrice's speech at the end of *Paradis* I)
and the source of Chaucer's noble philosophy of love in *Troilus and
Criseyd*. (e.g. III, 1744 ff.).

The final poem of Book IV is a hymn of
encouragement; the heroes [Agamemnon](#appendix002.xhtml_g5){#preface001.xhtml_p5}, [Odysseus](#appendix002.xhtml_g94){#preface001.xhtml_p94} and [Hercules](#appendix002.xhtml_g49){#preface001.xhtml_p49} are celebrated as examples of
achievement and as incentives on the final stage in the ascent to divinity. The
discussion of Fate and Providence leads automatically into the Fifth Book. In the
first chapter in answer to Boethius's inquiry the rule of the chain of
causes is asserted and the existence []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000210}of chance denied. The
doctrine of Fate and Providence and of auxiliary causes stems from Plato, but here
it is the Aristotelian development of the analysis of contingency into absolute and
incidental cause and an Aristotelian example which Philosophy uses.
[^40^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000366){#preface001.xhtml_con0000211}
In the second chapter freedom is asserted in terms of the Platonic tradition
-- the more one shares in the divine, the more one achieves freedom. But
the assertion that the choice of the individual soul is already known to Providence
raises a further difficulty for Boethius -- the apparent incompatibility
between divine foreknowledge and freedom of the will. It is impossible to believe
that God's Providence is fallible or dependent on temporal events; and yet
foreknowledge, if it is to be truly knowledge, seems to impose a necessity upon
events and actions which makes something monstrous of reward and punishment by God.
There was little comfort for Boethius in the Augustinian solution which made human
freewill dependent on the will of God, and he could find no satisfaction in any
consolatory belief in predestination. And so he presses the argument forward until
he can justify a belief in a human freedom sufficient to make room for moral
responsibility.

His solution is provided by the
combination of two considerations. First, the argument that the quality of knowledge
depends on the capacity of the knower to know, not on the capacity of the object to
be known; and second, the comparison of God's capacity to know with
man's. This leads to Boethius's classic definition of eternity
at the beginning of the last chapter of all. Its ultimate source, once again, though
transmuted through the words of Proclus,
[^41^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000369){#preface001.xhtml_con0000213}
is in the *Timaeu*. (37D E) and Plato's idea of time as a
moving image of eternity. But Boethius's development is expressed with
such lucidity and compactness that -- like a number of his other
definitions -- it was accepted as authoritative by St Thomas Aquinas and
the medieval schoolmen. Eternity is explained not in terms of quantity of life, but
[]{#preface001.xhtml_con0000214}in terms of quality of life: in virtue of His complete,
simultaneous and perfect possession of everlasting life, God, in Whom there is no
past or future, but only timeless present, is eternal, while the world which only
attains an endless series of moments, each lost as soon as it is attained, is merely
perpetual. Boethius is pressing at the limits of what language can do.

This definition, the theory of
knowledge, and the Aristotelian theory of the two kinds of necessity, form the core
of Boethius's explanation of the compatibility of God's
infallible knowledge and man's freedom of will. God is like a spectator at
a chariot race; he watches the actions the charioteers perform, but this does not
cause them. Similarly, God's vision of events which is eternal in the
sense that God is eternal, means that He is a kind of spectator of all things
simultaneously, past and future in one timeless present, without causing them. God
is thus able to have knowledge of that which seen from the point of view of men in
time is of uncertain occurrence.

This solution, of course, is meant as an
answer to a particular kind of objection, and Boethius cannot be held to blame for
not answering the kind of difficulty which might be raised today. Few have grappled
more honestly with the problems of good and evil, fate and freewill; and if
Boethius's answers are not entirely satisfactory, Philosophy's
own words may remind us that 'it is not allowed to man to comprehend in
thought all the ways of the divine work.'
[^42^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000371){#preface001.xhtml_con0000217}
This is the traditional attitude of Christianity since St Paul to those
mysterious paradoxes of its doctrine which seem beyond human explanation, and in his
firm insistence on the two opposing principles of human freedom and divine
omniscience Boethius maintains a position perfectly in accord with Christian belief.
By a stroke of calculated art we are left at the end with Philosophy's
final exhortation, on a high plane, our gaze directed upwards, oblivious of the
prison house. []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000218}

##### IV. The Christianity of Boethius {#preface001.xhtml_con0000219 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

And so we return to a question already
proposed: what is the quality of Boethius's Christianity? It would not be
difficult to show that in spite of his dependence on doctrines borrowed from [Stoicism](#appendix002.xhtml_g127){#preface001.xhtml_p127}, from Plato and Aristotle
and from [Neoplatonism](#appendix002.xhtml_g88){#preface001.xhtml_p88}, there is little
in the *Consolation* that is openly contrary to the tenets of Christianity.
That which there is -- the doctrine of *anamnesi* which presupposes
the prior existence of the soul before birth, and the doctrine of the perpetuity of
the world and the implicit denial of creation *ex nihil* in the
*Timaeu* poem
[^43^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000374){#preface001.xhtml_con0000221}
-- is not of fundamental significance in the *Consolation*.
Indeed there are important differences between Boethius and the Neoplatonism to
which so much of his thought conforms. The Deity of Plotinus was absolutely
transcendent and ineffable: from it through a hierarchy of powers such as Mind,
World-Soul, Nature, etc., emanated the multiplicity of finite things.
Plotinus's Neoplatonic successors actually increased the intermediary
beings between God and corporeal objects in order to emphasize the transcendence of
the supreme Godhead, until they had constructed an 'amazing metaphysical
museum, with all the entities and super-entities neatly labelled and arranged on
their proper shelves'.
[^44^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000376){#preface001.xhtml_con0000222}

All this, however, is quite alien to
Boethius. He talks not of a supreme essence but of God: and he does not fill the gap
between God and His world by any elaborate series of'graded
abstractions'.
[^45^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000378){#preface001.xhtml_con0000224}
Boethius's God is a personal God, a God to whom one can and should
pray, as he reminds us in the closing words of the *Consolation*.

It is tempting, therefore, to argue that
the reason why there is no mention of Christ and Christianity and no explicit
reference to the []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000226}Bible in the *Consolation* is that
Boethius was writing a *philosophica* consolation, and not a theological one.
'Did you not read my title?' C. S. Lewis suggests Boethius would
say:
[^46^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000381){#preface001.xhtml_con0000227}
'I wrote philosophically, not religiously, because I had chosen the
consolations of philosophy not those of religion as my subject. You might as well
ask why a book on arithmetic does not use geometrical methods.'

It is true that an author would be
expected to distinguish between disciplines and avoid introducing alien methods:
thus when Boethius commends Philosophy for the way in which she has presented her
arguments -- in her own words they are 'arguments not sought from
without but within the bounds of the matter we have been discussing'
[^47^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000383){#preface001.xhtml_con0000229}
-- he appears to be commending her for sticking to the methods of
philosophy and not importing anything from revelation. Here as in the rest of
Boethius's work, we seem to meet a clear distinction between faith and
reason.
[^48^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000385){#preface001.xhtml_con0000230}

It seems strange, nevertheless, that
writing in the presence of death Boethius still prefers reason to faith, and makes
no mention of what must be the only fully meaningful consolation for a Christian,
the Incarnation of Christ and the doctrine of grace.
[^49^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000387){#preface001.xhtml_con0000232}
For St Augustine, since man could accomplish nothing of himself, his absolute
dependence on the grace of God was at the same time his freedom and happiness. But
the Boethian doctrine of salvation, the ascent of the unaided individual by means of
philosophical introspection and meditation to the knowledge of God, for all the
closeness between Neoplatonic philosophy and post-Augustinian Christianity, []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000233}is essentially pagan in inspiration. This is the reason why in
his *Dialogue of Cumfor* Sir Thomas More rejects the philosophers of old:
[^50^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000390){#preface001.xhtml_con0000234}
and it is interesting to note that even in the Middle Ages which accepted
Boethius as a saint, commentators and scholars like Bruno of Corvey and John of
Salisbury noticed the absence of Christian doctrine from the *Consolation*.
It is hard to avoid the conclusion that Boethius professed a sort of
*christianisme neutralise*.
[^51^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000392){#preface001.xhtml_con0000235}
. 'Boethius needs neither word nor Spirit nor mercy, neither church
nor fellow-Christians in order to be what he is. It is therefore no accident but
entirely appropriate that his last confession does not speak about
Christ.'
[^52^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000394){#preface001.xhtml_con0000236}
He belonged to an age in which the ancient classical culture had become
assimilated to Christianity, but not absorbed by it. The schools, for instance, were
still pagan. And Boethius had not undergone the inner conversion of a [Sidonius](#appendix002.xhtml_g122){#preface001.xhtml_p122} or an Ennodius: the ancient learning
still preserved its hold upon him unimpaired.
[^53^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000396){#preface001.xhtml_con0000237}

It may be, however, that the question of
Boethius' Christianity has not been correctly formulated. It may be that
if more were known of the intellectual climate of Roman society at the time the
problem would appear in a different light.

> [^54^](#preface001-fn.xhtml_con0000398){#preface001.xhtml_con0000240}

in the changed attitude towards
philosophy since the later middle ages. Between the days of Augustine and those of
Siger of Brabant it was the universal conviction among those who thought seriously
that there was a single true rational account of man and the universe and of an
omnipotent and provident God, as valid in its degree as the revealed truths of
Christianity. The great men of old, pagan though they might have been, had attained
and expressed this truth in their philosophy could one but reproduce their []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000242}teaching faithfully, and with their aid a true and sufficient
answer could be given to the problems of human life and destiny. It was with these
answers that the philosophical mind could meet the world and all the disasters of
life. Behind the rational arguments, no doubt, in the unseen realm of the soul, an
individual could meet the personal love and grace of Christ.

##### []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000245}V. The Text {#preface001.xhtml_con0000244 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

In making this translation I have used
Weinberger's text of the *Consolatio* in the *Corpus Scriptorum
Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum*, LXVII, Vienna/Leipzig, 1934, and also the
edition of L. Bieler in the *Corpus Christianorum, Series Latina XCIV*,
Turnhout, 1957. I have occasionally consulted the Loeb Classical Library edition of
the *Theological Tractates and Consolation* by H. F. Stewart and E. K. Rand
(Harvard University Press, 1918) and the translation of W. V. Cooper, London,
1902.

Apart from the problems that face all
translators, the *Consolation* presents a number of other difficulties; the
variety of the metres (which I have not attempted to reflect in any systematic way);
the occasional use of problematic technical terms; the intermittent []{#preface001.xhtml_con0000248}personification of figures such as Fortune and Nature. Even our
'prince of poets', Chaucer, turned it only into prose which was
sometimes awkward. I cannot hope to have had better success.

The chief debts of the Introduction
will be clear from my footnotes. For many helpful suggestions I should like to thank
the present Joint Editor of the Penguin Classics, Mrs Betty Radice, and my gratitude
is also due to my wife, and to my parents-in-law, Mr and Mrs W. Curtis, for their
hospitality during the times when most of this translation was completed.

While I was quietly thinking these
thoughts over to myself and giving vent to my sorrow with the help of my pen, I
became aware of a woman standing over me. She was of awe-inspiring appearance, []{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000411}her eyes burning and keen beyond the usual power of men. She
was so full of years that I could hardly think of her as of my own generation, and
yet she possessed a vivid colour and undiminished vigour. It was difficult to be
sure of her height, for sometimes she was of average human size, while at other
times she seemed to touch the very sky with the top of her head, and when she lifted
herself even higher, she pierced it and was lost to human sight. Her clothes were
made of imperishable material, of the finest thread woven with the most delicate
skill. (Later she told me that she had made them with her own hands.) Their
splendour, however, was obscured by a kind of film as of long neglect, like statues
covered in dust. On the bottom hem could be read the embroidered Greek letter Pi,
and on the top hem the Greek letter Theta.
[^1^](#chapter001-fn.xhtml_con0001317){#chapter001.xhtml_con0000412}
Between the two a ladder of steps rose from the lower to the higher letter. Her
dress had been torn by the hands of marauders who had each carried off such pieces
as he could get. There were some books in her right hand, and in her left hand she
held a sceptre.

At the sight of the Muses of Poetry at
my bedside dictating words to accompany my tears, she became angry.

'Who,' she demanded,
her piercing eyes alight with fire, 'has allowed these hysterical sluts to
approach this sick man's bedside? They have no medicine to ease his pains,
only sweetened poisons to make them worse. These are the very creatures who slay the
rich and fruitful harvest of Reason with the barren thorns of Passion. They
habituate men to their sickness of mind instead of curing them. If as usual it was
only some ordinary man you were carrying off a victim of your blandishments, it
would matter little to me -- there []{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000415}Would be no harm
done to my work. But this man has been nourished on the philosophies of Zeno and
Plato. Sirens is a better name for you and your deadly enticements: be gone, and
leave him for my own Muses to heal and cure.'

These rebukes brought blushes of shame
into the Muses' cheeks, and with downcast eyes they departed in a dismal
company. Tears had partly blinded me, and I could not make out who this woman of
such imperious authority was. I could only fix my eyes on the ground overcome with
surprise and wait in silence for what she would do next. She came closer and sat
down on the edge of my bed. I felt her eyes resting on my face, downcast and lined
with grief. Then sadly she began to recite the following lines about my confusion of
mind.

##### II {#chapter001.xhtml_con0000417 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

[]{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000418}

> 'So sinks the mind in
> deep despair\
> And sight grows dim; when storms of life\
> Inflate the
> weight of earthly care,\
> The mind forgets its inward light\
> And turns in
> trust to the dark without.\
> This was the man who once was free\
> To climb

'But it is time for healing,
not lamenting,' she went on. Then, fixing her eyes intently upon me, she
said, 'You are the man, are you not, who was brought up on the milk of my
learning and fed on my own food until you reached maturity? I gave you arms to
protect you and keep your strength unimpaired, but you threw them away. Surely you
recognize me? And yet you do not speak. Is it shame or is it astonishment that keeps
you silent? I should prefer it to be shame, but I see that it is not.'

When she saw that it was not that I
would not speak, but that, dumbstruck, I could not, she gently laid her hand on my
breast and said, 'It is nothing serious, only a touch of amnesia that he
is suffering, the common disease of deluded minds. He has forgotten for a while who
he is, but he will soon remember once he has recognized me. To make it easier for
him I will wipe a little of the blinding cloud of worldly concern from his
eyes.'

As she spoke she gathered her dress into
a fold and wiped from my eyes the tears that filled them.

##### III {#chapter001.xhtml_con0000423 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

In the same way the clouds of my grief
dissolved and I drank in the light. With my thoughts recollected I turned to examine
the face of my physician. I turned my eyes and fixed my gaze upon her, and I saw
that it was my nurse in whose house I had been cared for since my youth --
Philosophy. I asked her why she had come down from the heights of heaven to my
lonely place of banishment.

'Is it to suffer false
accusation along with me?' I asked.

'Why, my child,' she
replied, 'should I desert you? Why should I not share your labour and the
burden you have been saddled with because of the hatred of my name? Should I be
frightened by being accused? Or cower in fear as if it were something unprecedented?
This is hardly the first time wisdom has been threatened with danger by the forces
of evil. In olden times, too, before the time of my servant Plato, I fought many a
great battle against the reckless forces of folly. And then, in Plato's
own lifetime, his master [Socrates](#appendix002.xhtml_g123){#chapter001.xhtml_p123} was
unjustly put to death -- a victorious death won with me at his side. After
that the mobs of Epicureans and Stoics and the others each did all they could to
seize for themselves the inheritance of wisdom that he left. As part of their
plunder they tried to carry me off, but I fought and struggled, and in the fight the
robe was torn which I had woven with my own hands. []{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000428}They tore off
little pieces from it and went away in the fond belief that they had obtained the
whole of philosophy. The sight of traces of my clothing on them gained them the
reputation among the ignorant of being my familiars, and as a result many of them
became corrupted by the ignorance of the uninitiated mob.

'But even if you do not know
the stories of the foreign philosophers, how [Anaxagoras](#appendix002.xhtml_g11){#chapter001.xhtml_p11} was banished from Athens, how
Socrates was put to death by poisoning, and how Zeno was tortured, you do know of
Romans like [Canius](#appendix002.xhtml_g29){#chapter001.xhtml_p29}, Seneca and [Soranus](#appendix002.xhtml_g125){#chapter001.xhtml_p125}, whose memory is still fresh
and celebrated. The sole cause of their tragic sufferings was their obvious and
complete contempt of the pursuits of immoral men which my teaching had instilled in
them. It is hardly surprising if we are driven by the blasts of storms when our
chief aim on this sea of life is to displease wicked men. And though their numbers
are great, we can afford to despise them because they have no one to lead them and
are carried along only by ignorance which distracts them at random first one way
then another. When their forces attack us in superior numbers, our general conducts
a tactical withdrawal of his forces to a strong point, and they are left to encumber
themselves with useless plunder. Safe from their furious activity on our ramparts
above, we can smile at their efforts to collect all the most useless booty: our
citadel cannot fall to the assaults of folly.'

'Do you understand
this,' she went on, 'and have my words penetrated your mind?
-- or are you like the proverbial donkey, deaf to the lyre? Tell me why you
are weeping and why your eyes are full of tears. As Homer says,
[^2^](#chapter001-fn.xhtml_con0001320){#chapter001.xhtml_con0000451}

Speak out and hide it not within.

If you want the doctor's
help, you must reveal the wound.'

I collected my thoughts and replied with
vigour, 'Surely the severity of Fortune's attack on me needs no
further mention; it is self evident. Look at the mere appearance of this place. Is
it the library of my house which you chose yourself as a place of sure repose and
where you so often used to sit with me discussing all the topics of philosophy?
[^3^](#chapter001-fn.xhtml_con0001322){#chapter001.xhtml_con0000455}
Are my clothes the same and my face the same as when I used to probe the
secrets of nature with you, and you used to describe the various paths of the
planets with your stick and relate human ethics and the whole of human life to the
patterns of the celestial order?

'This, then, is how you reward
your followers. And yet it was no []{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000457}one but you who commended
Plato's opinion that commonwealths would be blessed if they should be
ruled by philosophers or if their rulers should happen to have studied philosophy.
[^4^](#chapter001-fn.xhtml_con0001326){#chapter001.xhtml_con0000458}
You took your cue from him and said that the reason why it was necessary for
philosophers to take part in government was to prevent the reins of government
falling into the hands of wicked and unprincipled men to the ruin and destruction of
the good. And it was upon this authority that I decided to transfer to public
administration what I had learned from you in the course of our private leisure. You
and God, who has sowed you in the minds of wise men, are my witnesses that the only
consideration to impel me to any office was a general desire for good. This was the
reason why I had no alternative but grimly to resist evil and why in the struggle to
defend justice I have always been indifferent to the hatred I inspired in men who
wielded greater power than mine - an indifference inspired by the knowledge that I
had freely followed my conscience. I have countless times opposed the attacks of [Cunigast](#appendix002.xhtml_g42){#chapter001.xhtml_p42} on the fortunes of some
defenceless person, or stopped Triguilla, the Prefect of the Palace, from some
injustice he had begun or already carried through. And I have countless times
interposed my authority to protect wretched men from danger when they were hounded
by the endless false accusations of the barbarians in their continuous and
unpunished lust for wealth. I have never been moved from justice to injustice by
anything. I have ached with as much pain as the provinces themselves to see their
fortunes ruined by private plundering and public taxation. When the terrible famine
came and a ruinous and inexplicable measure of forced sale of food supplies was
announced which seemed calculated to crush the province of [Campania](#appendix002.xhtml_g28){#chapter001.xhtml_p28} with poverty, I took up the cudgels
against the Pretorian Prefect in the interest of the common good, and although the
king knew of my actions, I succeeded in the struggle to block the sale.

'Again, in their hope and
ambition the palace jackals had already []{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000460}swallowed up the wealth
of an ex-consul called [Paulinus](#appendix002.xhtml_g102){#chapter001.xhtml_p102}, when
I snatched him from their very jaws. Another ex-consul, Albinus, had been presumed
guilty and I had to set myself against the hatred of the Public Prosecutor,
[^5^](#chapter001-fn.xhtml_con0001329){#chapter001.xhtml_con0000461}
Cyprian, to save him from punishment. You must surely agree that the opposition
I provoked against me was considerable. But I ought to have been the safer among the
rest, as my love of justice led me to keep no reserve of favour among the courtiers
for my greater safety. Yet who were the informers who struck me down? One was [Basilius](#appendix002.xhtml_g19){#chapter001.xhtml_p19}. He had previously been
dismissed from the royal service and was forced into impeaching me by his debts. Two
others were Opilio and [Gaudentius](#appendix002.xhtml_g62){#chapter001.xhtml_p62}. A
royal decree had sentenced them to banishment because of their countless frauds, and
to avoid complying they had protected themselves by seeking sanctuary. When the news
reached the king he made a proclamation that unless they had left the city of
Ravenna by the appointed day they would be driven out with their foreheads branded.
There could scarcely be greater severity than that. Yet the very same day they laid
information against me and the denunciation was accepted. Surely my actions
didn't deserve that? And surely the fact that my conviction was prejudged
didn't make just men of my accusers? Fortune should have blushed at the
sight of innocence accused, or at least at the depravity of my accusers.

'But you want to know the nub
of the charge against me. I am accused of having desired the safety of the Senate.
And as for the manner, I am accused of having prevented an informer from delivering
certain papers with which he intended to show the Senate guilty of treason. My Lady,
tell me what your advice is: am I to deny the charge to avoid causing you shame? But
the fact is that I did desire the safety of the Senate and will never cease to.
Perhaps

[]{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000464}I should confess,
except that my attempt to prevent the informer was not continued. Should I count it
a crime to have desired the safety of the Senate? They at any rate by their own
decrees about me have made it a crime. Imprudence may deceive itself, but it cannot
alter the true value of things, and the ruling of Socrates that it is quite wrong to
assent to falsehood and conceal truth forbids me either to hide truth or be party to
untruth.
[^6^](#chapter001-fn.xhtml_con0001333){#chapter001.xhtml_con0000465}
But I leave it to you and to the wise to judge of these events which I have
committed to writing to ensure that they are remembered, and to preserve for
posterity the true sequence of events.
[^7^](#chapter001-fn.xhtml_con0001335){#chapter001.xhtml_con0000466}

'As for the forged letters
cited as evidence that I had hoped for the freedom of Rome, there is little purpose
in speaking of them. It would have been obvious that they were forgeries had I been
allowed to make use of what carries the greatest weight in all such matters
--the confession of the very informers.

'But there is no freedom left
to hope for. If only there were! I would have replied with the same retort as Canius
made to the Emperor [Caligula](#appendix002.xhtml_g27){#chapter001.xhtml_p27} when he
was accused of being involved in a plot against him. If *I* had
known of it,'' he said, ''*you* would
not.''

'Grief has not so dulled my
wits in all this as to make me complain that the wicked have piled up their crimes
against virtue; but what does fill me with wonder is that they have brought their
hopes to fruition. It may be part of human weakness to have evil wishes, but it is
nothing short of monstrous that God should look on while every criminal is allowed
to achieve his purpose against the innocent. If this is so, it was hardly without
reason that one of your household
[^8^](#chapter001-fn.xhtml_con0001337){#chapter001.xhtml_con0000470}
asked where evil comes from if there is a god, and where good comes from if
there isn't.

[]{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000472}'Even
supposing there may have been some justice in that the evil men who are out for the
blood of all good men and of all the Senate also sought my own death when they saw
me championing them, surely I did not deserve the same treatment from the members of
the Senate themselves? You remember, I am sure, since you were always present to
give me your guidance when I was preparing a speech or some course of action
-- you remember how at Verona a charge of treason was made against Albinus
and how in his eagerness to see the total destruction of the Senate the king tried
to extend the charge to them all in spite of their universal innocence; and you
remember how I defended them with complete indifference to any danger, and you know
that I am telling the truth and have never boasted of any merit of mine. For as
often as a man receives the reward of fame for his boasting, the conscience that
indulges in self congratulation loses something of its secret merit.

'And now you see the outcome
of my innocence -- instead of reward for true goodness, punishment for a
crime I did not commit. Yet no confession however clear-cut of any crime has ever
found a jury so united in their agreement on the severest penalty that some were not
softened either by the thought of human weakness or the universal uncertainty of
human fortune. If I had been charged with planning to burn down sacred buildings, or
plotting the sacrilegious murder of priests, or aiming to massacre all men of worth,
I would still have been brought into court and either have confessed or been
convicted before the sentence was carried out. But here I am, nearly five hundred
miles away, condemned to death and to have my property confiscated, silenced, and
with no opportunity to offer a defence, all because of a somewhat too willing
support of the Senate. How they deserve that no one should ever be convicted on a
similar charge!

'Even those who laid the
information against me could see the dignity the charge conferred, and in order to
obscure it by the addition of some other charge, they lyingly alleged that in my
ambition for high office I had stained my conscience with acts of []{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000475}sacrilege. But you had taken up your dwelling within me and used to drive from my
mind every thought of human advancement and there could be no place for sacrilege
beneath your gaze. You used daily to instill in my ears and thoughts that
Pythagorean maxim, ''Follow God''.

And since you were there lifting me up to such a pitch of excellence as to make
me like a god, it was scarcely fitting that I should angle for the help of the
vilest of spirits. Then there is the blameless life in my home, my friendship with
the most honourable of men, and the sanctity of Symmachus, my father-in-law, a man
worthy of the same veneration as yourself; all these guarantee me against suspicion
of this charge. But the wickedness of it is that it is from you yourself that they
obtain their trust in this great accusation. For the very fact that I am steeped in
your teaching and trained in your morality seems to them to prove that I have been
engaged in evil practice. It is not enough that my devotion to you has not helped me
at all, but you are now made the victim of the hatred that should be directed at me
alone. Over and above all this, another weight is added to my load of ills in that
the world does not judge actions on their merit, but on their chance results, and
they consider that only those things which are blessed with a happy outcome have
been undertaken with sound advice. It is always the unfortunate who are first to be
deserted by the goodwill of men.

'I have no mind to recall all
the rumours that are circulating and the discord of their multifarious opinions. I
will just say that the final burden which adversity heaps on her victims, is that
when some accusation is made against them, they are believed to have deserved all
that they suffer. And so, stripped of every possession, thrust from my offices, and
with my reputation in ruins, for doing a favour I have received a punishment. I seem
to see the wicked []{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000478}haunts of criminals overflowing with happiness
and joy; I seem to see all the most desperate of men threatening new false
denunciations; I seem to see good men lying prostrate with fear at the danger I am
in while all abandoned villains are encouraged to attempt every crime in the
expectation of impunity or even in the hope of reward for its accomplishment; and I
seem to see the innocent deprived of peace and safety and even of all chance of self
defence.'

Throughout this long and noisy display
of grief, Philosophy remained unperturbed. When I had finished she looked at me
calmly and said:

'The moment I saw your sad and
tear-stained looks, they told me that you had been reduced to the misery of
banishment; but unless you had told me, I would still not have known how far you had
been banished. However, it is not simply a case of your having been banished far
from your home; you have wandered away yourself, []{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000484}or if you
prefer to be thought of as having been banished, it is you yourself that have been
the instrument of it. No one else could ever have done it. For if you remember the
country you came from, it is not governed by majority rule like Athens of old, but,
if I may quote Homer,
[^10^](#chapter001-fn.xhtml_con0001345){#chapter001.xhtml_con0000485}

> One is its lord and one its king;

and rather than having them banished, He
prefers to have a large body of subjects. Submitting to His governance and obeying
His laws is freedom. You seem to have forgotten the oldest law of your community,
that any man who has chosen to make his dwelling there has the sacred right never to
be banished. So there can be no fear of exile for any man within its walls and moat.
On the other hand, if anyone stops wanting to live there, he automatically stops
deserving it.

'And so it is not the sight of
this place which gives me concern but your own appearance, and it is not the walls
of your library with their glass and ivory decoration that I am looking for, but the
seat of your mind. That is the place where I once stored away --not my
books, but --the thing that makes them have any value, the philosophy they
contain.

'As for what you said about
your services to the common good, it was but scant measure considering the great
number of things you have done. Then your talk about the truth or untruth of the
charges against you is only what is known to many. And you were right in thinking
that the crimes and deceits of your accusers needed but cursory mention since they
are the continual talk of the people who are more richly and better acquainted with
their every detail. Then you spoke with considerable vehemence about the
Senate's unjust behaviour and spoke with grief of my inclusion in the
accusations and wept tears at the damage done to my injured reputation. And []{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000490}last of all, with your anger flaring up against Fortune, and
the bitter complaint that reward is not measured out according to desert, in your
final angry verses you prayed that the same peace that rules in the heavens should
rule on earth.

'In your present state of
mind, while this great tumult of emotion has fallen upon you and you are torn this
way and that by alternating fits of grief, wrath and anguish, it is hardly time for
the more powerful remedies. I will use gentler medicines. It is as if you had become
swollen and calloused under the influence of these disturbing passions, and by their
more gentle action they will temper you ready to receive the strength of a sharper
medicament.'

'Will you first then let me
discover your state of mind and test it with a few simple questions? That way I can
discover the best method of curing you.'

'Ask what you like,'
I replied, 'and I will answer.'

'Do you believe that this life
consists of haphazard and chance events, or do you think it is governed by some
rational principle?'

'I could never believe that
events of such regularity are due to the haphazards of chance. In fact I know that
God the Creator watches over His creation. The day will never come that sees me
abandon the truth of this belief.'

'It is true,' she
said, 'and indeed it is the very thing you were singing of just now when
you were deploring the fact that only mankind is outside God's care. It
was your firm conviction that all other things were governed by reason. So how you
can be sick when you hold so healthy a belief is quite beyond my understanding.
However, let us carry our examination deeper. I feel there is something missing
somewhere. Tell me, then, since you have no doubts that the world is governed by
God, what are the means by which you think He guides it?'

'I can't answer the
question,' I replied, 'because I don't understand what
it means.'

'I was right, then,'
she said, 'in thinking that something was missing. Your defences have been
breached and your mind has been infiltrated by the fever of emotional distraction.
So tell me, do you remember what is the end and purpose of things and the goal to
which the whole of Nature is directed?'

'I did hear it
once,' I said, 'but my memory has been blunted by
grief.'

'Well, do you know the source
from which all things come?'

'Yes,' I replied,
and said that it was God.

[]{#chapter001.xhtml_con0000527}'How can
it be then, that you know the beginning of things but don't know their
end? The peculiarity of these disturbances is that they have just enough power to
move a man from his usual position, but can't quite throw him over and
totally uproot him. I want you to answer this too: do you remember that you are a
man?'

'Why shouldn't
I?' I said.

'Can you, then, tell me what
man is?'

'Are you asking me if I know
whether man is a rational and mortal animal? I do know it and I acknowledge that
that is what I am.'

'Are you sure you are not
something more?'

'Quite sure.'

'Now I know the other cause,
or rather the major cause of your illness: you have forgotten your true nature. And
so I have found out in full the reason for your sickness and the way to approach the
task of restoring you to health. It is because you are confused by loss of memory
that you wept and claimed you had been banished and robbed of all your possessions.
And it is because you don't know the end and purpose of things that you
think the wicked and the criminal have power and happiness. And because you have
forgotten the means by which the world is governed you believe these ups and downs
of fortune happen haphazardly. These are grave causes and they lead not only to
illness but even death. Thanks, however, to the Author of all health, nature has not
quite abandoned you. In your true belief about the world's government
-- that it is subject to divine reason and not the haphazards of chance
-- there lies our greatest hope of rekindling your health. You need have no
fears then, now that this tiny spark has blazed with the fire of life. Still, as it
is not yet time for stronger medicine, and as it is the accepted opinion that the
nature of the mind is such that for every true belief it rejects, it assumes a false
one from which the fog of distraction rises to blot out its true insight, I will try
to lessen this particular fog little by little by applying gentle remedies of only
medium strength. In this way the darkness of the ever treacherous passions may be
dispelled, and you will be able to see the resplendent light of
truth.'

##### I {#chapter002.xhtml_con0000539 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

After this she fell silent for a while
and the very forbearance of her silence made me turn my attention to her. At this
she began to speak again.

'If I have fully diagnosed the
cause and nature of your condition, you are wasting away in pining and longing for
your former good fortune. It is the loss of this which, as your imagination works
upon you, has so corrupted your mind. I know the many disguises of that monster,
Fortune, and the extent to which she seduces with friendship the very people she is
striving to cheat, until she overwhelms them with unbearable grief at the suddenness
of her desertion. If you can recall to mind her character, her methods, and the kind
of favour she proffers, you will see that in her you did not have and did not lose
anything of value. But I am sure it will require no hard work on my part to bring
all this back to your memory. It used to be your way whenever she came near with her
flattery to attack her with manly arguments and hound her with pronouncements taken
from the oracle of my shrine. However, no sudden change of circumstances ever occurs
without some upheaval in the mind; and that is why you, too, have deserted for a
while your usual calm.

'It is time, then, for you to
take a little mild and pleasant nourishment which by being absorbed into your body
will prepare the way for something stronger. Let us bring to bear the persuasive
powers of sweet-tongued rhetoric, powers which soon go astray from the true path
unless they follow my instructions. And let us have as well Music, the maid-servant
of my house, to sing us melodies of varying mood.

[]{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000544}'What is
it then O mortal man, that has thrown you down into the slough of grief and
despondency? You must have seen something strange and unexpected. But you are wrong
if you think Fortune has changed towards you. Change is her normal behaviour, her
true nature. In the very act of changing she has preserved her own particular kind
of constancy towards you. She was exactly the same when she was flattering you and
luring you on with enticements of a false kind of happiness. You have discovered the
changing faces of the random goddess. To others she still veils herself, but to you
she has revealed herself to the full. If you are satisfied with her ways, you must
accept them and not complain. But if you shudder to think of her unreliability, you
must turn away and have nothing more to do with her dangerous games. She has caused
you untold sorrow when she ought to have been a source of peace. For she has left
you, she in whose constancy no man can ever trust. Do you really hold dear that kind
of happiness which is destined to pass away? Do you really value the presence of
Fortune when you cannot trust her to stay and when her departure will plunge you in
sorrow? And if it is impossible to keep her at will and if her flight exposes men to
ruin, what else is such a fleeting thing except a warning of coming disaster? It
will never be sufficient just to notice what is under one's nose: prudence
calculates what the outcome of things will be. Either way Fortune's very
mutability deprives her threats of their terror and her enticements of their allure.
And last of all, once you have bowed your neck beneath her yoke, you ought to bear
with equanimity whatever happens on Fortune's playground. If after freely
choosing her as the mistress to rule your life you want to draw up a law to control
her coming and going, you will be acting without any justification and your very
impatience will only worsen a lot which you cannot alter. Commit your boat to the
winds and you must sail whichever way they blow, not just where you want. If you
were a farmer who entrusts his seed to the fields, you would balance the bad years
against the good. So now you have committed yourself to the rule of Fortune, you
must acquiesce in []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000545}her ways. If you are trying to stop her wheel
from turning,
[^1^](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_con0001349){#chapter002.xhtml_con0000546}
you are of all men the most obtuse. For if it once begins to stop, it will no
longer be the wheel of chance.

##### II {#chapter002.xhtml_con0000548 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

'I would like to continue our
discussion a while by using Fortune's own arguments, and I would like you
to consider whether her demands are just. ''Why do you burden me
each day, mortal man,'' she asks, ''with
your querulous accusations? What harm have I done you? What possessions of yours
have I stolen? Choose any judge you like and sue me for possession of wealth and
rank, and if you can show that any part of these belongs by right to any mortal
man,

[]{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000551}I will willingly
concede that what you are seeking to regain really did belong to you. When nature
brought you forth from your mother's womb I received you naked and devoid
of everything and fed you from my own resources. I was inclined to favour you, and I
brought you up --and this is what makes you lose patience with me
--with a measure of indulgence, surrounding you with all the splendour and
affluence at my command. Now I have decided to withdraw my hand. You have been
receiving a favour as one who has had the use of another's possessions,
and you have no right to complain as if what you have lost was fully your own. You
have no cause to begin groaning at me: I have done you no violence. Wealth, honours
and the like are all under my jurisdiction. They are my servants and know their
mistress. When I come, they come with me, and when I go, they leave as well. I can
say with confidence that if the things whose loss you are bemoaning were really
yours, you could never have lost them. Surely I am not the only one to be denied the
exercise of my rights? The heavens are allowed to bring forth the bright daylight
and lay it to rest in the darkness of night: the year is allowed alternately to deck
the face of the earth with fruit and flowers and to disfigure it with cloud and
cold. The sea is allowed either to be calm and inviting or to rage with storm-driven
breakers. Shall man's insatiable greed bind me to a constancy which is
alien to my ways? Inconstancy is my very essence; it is the game I never cease to
play as I turn my wheel in its ever changing circle, filled with joy as I bring the
top to the bottom and the bottom to the top. Yes, rise up on my wheel if you like,
but don't count it an injury when by the same token you begin to fall, as
the rules of the game will require. You must surely have been aware of my ways. You
must have heard of [Croesus](#appendix002.xhtml_g43){#chapter002.xhtml_p43}, king of
Lydia, who was once able to terrorize his enemy [Cyrus](#appendix002.xhtml_g46){#chapter002.xhtml_p46}, only to be reduced to misery and be
condemned to be burnt alive: only a shower of rain saved him.
[^2^](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_con0001352){#chapter002.xhtml_con0000552}
And you must have heard of [Aemilius
Paulus](#appendix002.xhtml_g4){#chapter002.xhtml_p4} and how he wept tears of []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000553}pity at all the
disasters that had overwhelmed his prisoner, [Perses](#appendix002.xhtml_g104){#chapter002.xhtml_p104}, the last king of Macedonia.
[^3^](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_con0001355){#chapter002.xhtml_con0000554}
Isn't this what tragedy commemorates with its tears and tumult
--the overthrow of happy realms by the random strokes of Fortune? When you
were a little boy you must have heard Homer's story of the two jars
standing in God's house, the one full of evil and the other of good.
[^4^](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_con0001357){#chapter002.xhtml_con0000555}
Now, you have had more than your share of the good, but have I completely
deserted you? Indeed, my very mutability gives you just cause to hope for better
things. So you should not wear yourself out by setting your heart on living
according to a law of your own in a world that is shared by everyone.

##### III {#chapter002.xhtml_con0000575 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

'If Fortune herself had been
speaking, she would have left you without a single syllable you could utter by way
of reply. But if there is some argument which you can offer as a just defence for
your complaints, you must put it forward and we will give you a
hearing.'

And so I had my turn.

'All that you have
said,' I began, 'is certainly plausible and well sugared with
the sweet honey of rhetoric and music. But it is only while one is actually
listening that one is filled with pleasure, and for the wretched, the pain of their
suffering goes deeper. So as soon as your words stop sounding in our ears, the mind
is weighed down again by its deep seated melancholy.'

'It is true,' she
rejoined, 'for none of this is meant to be a cure for your condition, but
simply a kind of application to help soothe a grief still resistant to treatment.
When the time comes, I will apply something calculated to penetrate deep inside. In
the meantime stop thinking of yourself as plunged in misery. Have you forgotten how
fortunate you have been in many ways? I will not dwell on it, but when you were
orphaned you were taken up into the care of men of the highest rank and chosen to
marry into families which boasted the state's most distinguished citizens.
Even before you became their kinsman, you had begun to win their love, and that is
the most precious kind of kinship of all. There was no one who would not have called
you the luckiest man in the world, considering the glory reflected from your new
connexions, the modesty of your wife, and the blessings your two sons proved to be.
I have no desire to waste time on ordinary matters, so I will pass over the various
dignities you received while still a young man, dignities which are denied the
majority of men at any age. I want to come straight to the outstanding culmination
of your fortune. If the enjoyment of any earthly blessing brings with it any measure
of happiness, the memory []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000580}of that splendid day can never be
destroyed by the burden however great of growing evil. I mean the day that you saw
your two sons amid the crowding senators and the rapture of the people carried forth
from your house to be consuls together -- the day they took their official
seats in the senate chamber to listen to you delivering the speech of congratulation
to the king and saw the genius of your oratory receive its crowning recognition: the
same day as you sat in the stadium between the two consuls and as if it were a
military triumph let your largess fulfil the wildest expectations of the people
packed in their seats around you.

'In my opinion you beguiled
Fortune with empty words so long as you had her caresses and she cherished you as
her darling. And you went off with a gift never before bestowed on any private
individual. Perhaps you would like to reckon up the score with her? You will find
this is the very first time she has turned an unfriendly eye upon you. If you
thought of all the things that have happened to you, what kind of things they were,
and whether they were happy or unhappy things, you would not be able to say you have
not been fortunate up to now. On the other hand, if you do not consider that you
have been lucky because your onetime reasons for rejoicing have passed away, you
cannot now think of yourself as in misery, because the very things that seem
miserable are also passing away. Why behave like a stranger newly arrived on the
stage of life? You know there is no constancy in human affairs, when a single swift
hour can often bring a man to nothing. For even if you can't expect any
permanence in a life of chance events, on the last day of one's life there
is a kind of death for Fortune even when she stays with one. What difference do you
think it makes whether it is you that quit her by dying or she that quits you by
desertion?

##### IV {#chapter002.xhtml_con0000601 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

'All that you say is
true,' I agreed. 'You truly are mother of all virtues, and I
cannot deny the speed with which I rose to prosperity. It is the very thing, in
fact, which makes me burn with grief as I remember it. In all adversity of fortune,
the most wretched kind is once to have been happy.'
[^5^](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_con0001360){#chapter002.xhtml_con0000603}

'But you are suffering because
of your misguided belief, and you can't blame events for that,'
she replied. 'If you are really so moved by the empty name of chance
happiness, you can reckon up with me now the number of the very great blessings you
still enjoy. And if you find that you still possess that which among all the gifts
of Fortune was most precious to you and find it through God's power
unharmed and still untouched, you will hardly be able to talk about misfortune with
any justice while you still possess outstanding blessings.

[]{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000606}'Take your
father-in-law, Symmachus, one of the most precious ornaments of the human race; he
is still full of vigour and-- something you would willingly pay for with
your life -- a man wholly composed of wisdom and virtue, who disregards his
own sufferings and weeps for yours. Your wife, too, is alive, a lady unsurpassed in
nobility and modesty of character; to sum up all her qualities in a word, I would
say she is the mirror of her father. She is, as I say, still alive and in her
disgust with this life draws every breath for you alone. She longs for you and is
consumed with tears and suffering, one thing in which I would concede that your
happiness is diminished. I don't know what more to add about your consular
sons. Now, as when they were boys, they reflect the example of their
father's and grandfather's character. You are a happy man, then,
if you know where your true happiness lies, since when the chief concern of mortal
men is to keep their hold on life, you even now possess blessings which no one can
doubt are more precious than life itself. So dry your tears. Fortune has not yet
turned her hatred against all your blessings. The storm has not yet broken upon you
with too much violence. Your anchors are holding firm and they permit you both
comfort in the present, and hope in the future.'

'And I pray that they will
hold,' I said. 'So long as they do, we will ride the storm out.
But look how far events have gone since the time of my glory.'

'If you are no longer
dissatisfied with the whole of your fortune, we have made a little
progress,' she said. 'But I can't put up with your
dilly-dallying and the dramatization of your care-worn grief-stricken complaints
that something is lacking from your happiness. No man is so completely happy that
something somewhere does not clash with his condition. It is the nature of human
affairs to be fraught with anxiety; they never prosper perfectly and they never
remain constant. In one man's case you will find riches offset by the
shame of a humble birth and in another's noble birth offset by unwelcome
publicity on account of the crippling poverty of his family fortunes. Some men are
blessed with both wealth and noble birth, but are []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000609}unhappy
because they have no wife. Some are happily married but without children, and
husband their money for an heir of alien blood. Some again have been blessed with
children only to weep over their misdeeds. No one finds it easy to accept the lot
Fortune has sent him. There is something in the case of each of us that escapes the
notice of the man who has not experienced it, but causes horror to the man who has.
Remember, too, that all the most happy men are over-sensitive. They have never
experienced adversity and so unless everything obeys their slightest whim they are
prostrated by every minor upset, so trifling are the things that can detract from
the complete happiness of a man at the summit of fortune. How many men do you think
would believe themselves almost in heaven if they possessed even the smallest part
of the luck you still enjoy? This very place which is banishment to you is home to
those who live here. So nothing is miserable except when you think it so, and vice
versa, all luck is good luck to the man who bears it with equanimity. No one is so
happy that he would not want to change his lot if he gives in to impatience. Such is
the bitter-sweetness of human happiness. To him that enjoys it, it may seem full of
delight, but he cannot prevent it slipping away when it will. It is evident,
therefore, how miserable the happiness of human life is; it does not remain long
with those who are patient, and doesn't satisfy those who are
troubled.

'Why then do you mortal men
seek after happiness outside yourselves, when it lies within you? You are led astray
by error and ignorance. I will briefly show you what complete happiness hinges upon.
If I ask you whether there is anything more precious to you than your own self, you
will say no. So if you are in possession of yourself you will possess something you
would never wish to lose and something Fortune could never take away. In order to
see that happiness can't consist in things governed by chance, look at it
this way. If happiness is the highest good of rational nature and anything that can
be taken away is not the highest good -- since it is surpassed by what
can't be taken away -- Fortune by her very mutability
can't hope to lead to happiness.

[]{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000612}'Again,
the man who is borne along by happiness which can at any time fail, either knows or
does not know its unreliability. If he does not know it, what kind of happiness can
there be in the blindness of ignorance? And if he does know it, he can't
avoid being afraid of losing that which he knows can be lost. And so a continuous
fear prevents him being happy. And if he thinks the possibility of losing it a
matter for indifference, then the good whose loss can be borne with such equanimity
must be small indeed.

'Furthermore, since you are a
man I know to have been fully convinced by innumerable proofs that the human mind
cannot die, and since it is clear that happiness which depends on chance comes to an
end with the death of the body, it seems beyond doubt that if this happiness
dependent on chance can bring pleasure, then the whole human race falls at death
into misery. Yet we know that many men have sought the enjoyment of happiness
through death and even through suffering and torment. It seems that the happiness
which cannot make men unhappy by its cessation, cannot either make them happy by its
presence.

'But the applications of
reasoning that I have been using on you are beginning to penetrate, and the time has
come, I think, for something rather stronger. So then, if the gifts that Fortune
offers are not transitory and short-lived, tell me, which is there among them that
can ever belong to you or whose worthlessness is not revealed by a
moment's thoughtful consideration? What makes riches precious, the fact
that they belong to you or some quality of their own? And which is preferable, the
gold itself or the power conferred by hoarded wealth? Yet if being miserly always
makes men hated, while being generous wins them popularity, it is by spending rather
than hoarding that men win the better reputation. Now, if something which is
transferred to another cannot remain with its first owner, it is only when money is
transferred to others in the exercise of liberality and ceases to be possessed that
it becomes valuable. This same money, if it were ever collected together from
wherever it lies among people into the possession of one man would make all the rest
destitute of it. When you speak, your whole voice fills the ears of many hearers to
an equal extent, but your riches cannot in the same way be shared equally among many
without diminution. When riches are shared among many it is inevitable that they
impoverish those from whom they pass. How poor and barren riches really are, then,
is clear from the way that it is impossible for many to share them undiminished, or
for one man to possess them without reducing all the others to poverty.

[]{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000619}'Perhaps
your eyes are attracted by the way precious stones reflect the light. But if there
is any special quality in this brilliance, it is in the light of the precious
stones, not of men, so that I am astonished that men can admire them. Surely there
is nothing devoid of life to give it movement, and devoid of structure, which living
rational nature can justifiably consider beautiful? Such things may be works of the
Creator and may draw some minimal beauty from their own ornamental nature, but they
are of an inferior rank to you as a more excellent creature, and cannot in any way
merit your admiration.

'Perhaps, again, you find
pleasure in the beauty of the countryside. Creation is indeed very beautiful, and
the countryside a beautiful part of creation. In the same way we are sometimes
delighted by the appearance of the sea when it's very calm and look up
with wonder at the sky, the stars, the moon and the sun. However, not one of these
has anything to do with you, and you daren't take credit for the splendour
of any of them. The fact that flowers blossom in spring confers no distinction on
you, and the swelling fullness of the autumn harvest is no work of yours. You are,
in fact, enraptured with empty joys, embracing blessings that are alien to you as if
they were your own. I ask you, why? For Fortune can never make yours what Nature has
made alien to you. Of course the fruits of the land are appointed as food for living
beings; but if you wish only to satisfy your needs -- and that is all
Nature requires -- there is no need to seek an excess from Fortune. Nature
is content with few and little: if you try to press superfluous additions upon what
is sufficient for Nature, your bounty will become sickening if not harmful.

'Perhaps you think that beauty
means being resplendent in clothing of every variety: but if the clothing catches my
eye, my admiration will be directed at either the quality of the material or the
skill of the tailor. If you take pleasure in having a long line of attendants to
wait on you, there are two points to consider: either they are rogues, in which case
your household is nothing less than a dangerous burden and a positive threat to its
master; or they are honest, and other []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000622}men's honesty
can scarcely be counted among your possessions.

'From all this it is obvious
that not one of those things which you count among your blessings is in fact any
blessing of your own at all. And if, then, they don't contain a spark of
beauty worth seeking, why weep over their loss or rejoice at their preservation? If
Nature gives them their beauty, how does it involve you? They would still have been
pleasing by themselves, even if separated from your possessions. It isn't
because they are part of your wealth that they are precious, but because you thought
them precious that you wanted to add them to the sum of your riches.

'What in fact is it that you
are looking for in all this outcry against Fortune? To put poverty to flight with
plenty? If so, it has turned out the very opposite. The more varied your precious
possessions, the more help you need to protect them, and the old saying is proved
correct, he who hath much, wants much. And the contrary is true as well, he needs
least who measures wealth according to the needs of nature, and not the excesses of
ostentation.

'It seems as if you feel a
lack of any blessing of your own inside you, which is driving you to seek your
blessings in things separate and external. And so when a being endowed with a
godlike quality in virtue of his rational nature thinks that his only splendour lies
in the possession of inanimate goods, it is the overthrow of the natural order.
Other creatures are content with what is their own, but you, whose mind is made in
the image of God, seek to adorn your superior nature with inferior objects,
oblivious of the great wrong you do your Creator. It was His will that the human
race should rule all earthly creatures, but you have degraded yourself to a position
beneath the lowest of all. If every good is agreed to be more valuable than whatever
it belongs to, then by your own judgement when you account the most worthless of
objects as goods
[^6^](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_con0001363){#chapter002.xhtml_con0000626}
of yours, you []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000627}make yourself lower than those very things,
and it is no less than you deserve. Indeed, the condition of human nature is just
this; man towers above the rest of creation so long as he recognizes his own nature,
and when he forgets it, he sinks lower than the beasts. For other living things to
be ignorant of themselves, is natural; but for man it is a defect. What an obvious
mistake to make -- to think that anything can be enhanced by decoration
that does not belong to it. It's impossible. For if there is anything
striking in the decoration, that is what is praised, while the veiled and hidden
object continues just the same in all its ugliness.

'My contention is that no good
thing harms its owner, a thing which you won't gainsay. But wealth very
often does harm its owners, for all the most criminal elements of the population who
are thereby all the more covetous of other people's property are convinced
that they alone are worthy to possess all the gold and precious stones there are.
You are shuddering now at the thought of club and knife, but if you had set out on
the path of this life with empty pockets, you would whistle your way past any
highwayman. How splendid, then, the blessing of mortal riches is! Once won, they
never leave you carefree again.

'I should like to say something
about the dignities of high office and the exercise of power, but I am at a loss
because in your ignorance of the true nature of power and dignities people like you
exalt []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000634}themselves to high heaven in virtue of the offices they
hold. Now, whenever high office has fallen into the hands of wicked men, the
disaster has been greater than flood or volcanic eruption. You remember, I am sure,
how (principle of freedom though it had been) your ancestors wanted to abolish the
consulship because of the arrogance of the consuls, just as before that the same
arrogance had led them to abolish the title of king. If, on the other hand, the very
rare case arises when these offices fall to honest men, surely the only aspect of
them which finds favour is the honesty of the men who hold the offices. It follows,
if this is so, that honour is not accorded to virtue because of the office held, but
to the office because of the virtue of the holder.

'However, let us examine this
much lauded and much sought after power of yours. You creatures of earth,
don't you stop to consider the people over whom you think you exercise
authority? You would laugh if you saw a community of mice and one mouse arrogating
to himself power and jurisdiction over the others. Again, think of the human body:
could you discover anything more feeble than man, when often even a tiny fly can
kill him either by its bite or by creeping into some inward part of him? The only
way one man can exercise power over another is over his body and what is inferior to
it, his possessions. You cannot impose anything on a free mind, and you cannot move
from its state of inner tranquillity a mind at peace with itself and firmly founded
on reason. The tyrant [Nearchus](#appendix002.xhtml_g86){#chapter002.xhtml_p86} thought
he would be able to torture the philosopher Zeno
[^8^](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_con0001369){#chapter002.xhtml_con0000636}
into betraying his fellow conspirators in a plot against his person, but Zeno
bit off his tongue and threw it in the face of the enraged tyrant. Nearchus had
thought the tortures an occasion for barbarity, but Zeno made them an opportunity
for heroism. There is nothing, in fact, which one man can do to another, which he
cannot []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000637}himself suffer at the hands of someone else. We have the
story of how the Egyptian king [Busiris](#appendix002.xhtml_g24){#chapter002.xhtml_p24}
used to put strangers to death until he himself was killed by a stranger in the
person of [Hercules](#appendix002.xhtml_g64){#chapter002.xhtml_p64}.
[^9^](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_con0001373){#chapter002.xhtml_con0000638}
And in the first Punic War your general [Regulus](#appendix002.xhtml_g118){#chapter002.xhtml_p118} put fetters on many a Carthaginian
prisoner of war, but not long afterwards was himself holding out his hands to
receive a conqueror's chains.
[^10^](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_con0001375){#chapter002.xhtml_con0000639}
Can you, then, consider it power at all, when a man cannot ensure that someone
does not inflict on him what he can inflict on others?

'If, furthermore, in these
dignities and powers there was some natural and intrinsic good, they would never
fall into the hands of evil men, since incompatible things do not usually associate,
and nature rejects the combination of opposites. There is no doubt, then, that for
the most part it is evil men who hold the offices, and it is therefore clear that
these are not intrinsically good, since they admit of being associated with evil
men. And the same may be properly concluded in the case of all fortune's
gifts, since they fall in greater abundance on all the most wicked people. There is
another point to be considered about them. No one doubts that a man in whom he has
seen evidence of bravery is brave: a man endowed with speed is manifestly speedy. In
the same way music makes a man a musician, medicine makes him a doctor, and rhetoric
makes him an orator; for it is the nature of anything to perform the office proper
to it. It does not become mixed up in the operations of contrary things and actually
repels opposites. But riches are unable to quench insatiable greed; power does not
make a man master of himself if he is imprisoned by the indissoluble chains of
wicked lusts; and when high office is bestowed on unworthy men, so far from making
them worthy, it only betrays them and reveals their unworthiness. The reason for
this is that you are accustomed to using the wrong words to refer to things which
are by nature otherwise, and are easily proved to be so by their very operation. []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000641}So neither riches, power nor high office can properly be called
by these words. And lastly we may reach the same conclusion about Fortune as a
whole. She has nothing worth pursuing, and no trace of intrinsic good; she never
associates with good men and does not turn into good men those with whom she does
associate.

Surely you see, then, how cramped and
confined the fame is which you are toiling to spread and propagate. You cannot
expect []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000649}the reputation of one of her citizens to succeed in
penetrating regions which the glorious name of Rome cannot reach. And what about the
fact that the manners and customs of different peoples are so unalike that different
peoples will consider the same thing praiseworthy or punishable? A man may be
pleased at the publication of his fame abroad, but among many peoples it may not be
to his benefit at all to have his reputation spread. So a man will be content when
he is famous throughout his own people, and his bright immortal fame will be
confined within the bounds of a single nation.

'Many men have been famous in
their time but their memory has perished because there were no historians to write
about them. And yet the very histories are of little use when like their authors
they become lost in the depths of time which makes all things obscure. When you
think of your future fame you think you are creating for yourself a kind of
immortality. But if you think of the infinite recesses of eternity you have little
cause to take pleasure in any continuation of your name. The span of a single second
can be compared with ten thousand years, but minute though it may be, it still has a
value in proportion because each is a finite measure of time. But ten thousand
years, or any multiple of it however great, cannot be compared with unending
eternity. For while finite things can be compared with one another, the finite and
the infinite can never be compared. So however protracted the life of your fame,
when compared with unending eternity it is shown to be not just little, but nothing
at all.

'You, however, don't
know how to act uprightly except with an eye to popular favour and empty reputation.
You ignore those excellent qualities, a good conscience and virtue, and pursue your
reward in the common gossip of people. Listen while I tell you how cleverly someone
once ridiculed the shallowness of this kind of conceit. A certain man once made a
virulent attack on another man for falsely assuming the title of philosopher more in
order to satisfy his overweening pride than to practise virtue, and added that he
would accept that the title was justified if the man could suffer attacks []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000652}upon him with patience and composure. For a time he did assume
patience and after accepting the insults asked with a sneer whether the other now
agreed that he was a philosopher. ''I
would,'' came the reply, ''if you had not
spoken.''
[^13^](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_con0001385){#chapter002.xhtml_con0000653}

'But it is great men we are
considering, men who seek fame for virtue. What do they care about reputation when
the body grows lifeless in death which ends all things? If the whole of man dies,
body and soul --a belief which our reason forbids us --fame is
nothing at all, since the man who is said to have won it doesn't exist.
But if the mind stays conscious when it is freed from the earthly prison and seeks
out heaven in freedom, surely it will despise every earthly affair. In the
experience of heaven it will rejoice in its delivery from earthly things.

'But I don't want you
to think I am rigidly opposed to Fortune, for there are times when she stops
deceiving and helps man. I mean when she reveals herself, when she throws off her
disguise and admits her game. Perhaps you still don't understand what
I'm saying. What I want to say is a paradox, and so I am hardly able to
put it into words. For bad fortune, I think, is more use to a man than good fortune.
Good fortune always seems to bring happiness, but deceives you with her smiles,
whereas bad fortune is always truthful because by change she shows her true
fickleness. Good fortune deceives, but bad fortune enlightens. With her display of
specious riches good fortune enslaves the minds of those who enjoy her, while bad
fortune gives men release through the recognition of how fragile a thing happiness
is. And so you can see Fortune in one way capricious, wayward and ever inconstant,
and in another way sober, prepared and made wise by the experience of her own
adversity. And lastly, by her flattery good fortune lures men away from the path of
true good, but adverse fortune frequently draws men back to their true good like a
shepherdess with her crook. Do you think it is of small account that this harsh and
terrible misfortune has revealed those friends whose hearts are loyal to you? She
has shown you the friends []{#chapter002.xhtml_con0000658}whose smiles were true smiles, and
those whose smiles were false; in deserting you Fortune has taken her friends with
her and left those who are really yours. Had you remained untouched and, as you
thought, blessed by Fortune, you would have been unable to get such knowledge at any
price. So you are weeping over lost riches when you have really found the most
precious of all riches -- friends who are true friends.

She had stopped singing, but the
enchantment of her song left me spellbound. I was absorbed and wanted to go on
listening. After a moment I spoke to her.

'You are the greatest comfort
for exhausted spirits. By the weight of your tenets and the delightfulness of your
singing you have so refreshed me that I now think myself capable of facing the blows
of Fortune. You were talking of cures that were rather sharp. The thought of them no
longer makes me shudder; in fact I'm so eager to hear more, I fervently
beg you for them.'

'I knew it,' she
replied. 'Once you began to hang on my words in silent attention, I was
expecting you to adopt this attitude --or rather, to be more exact, I
myself created it in you. The remedies still to come are, in fact, of such a kind
that they taste bitter to the tongue, but grow sweet once they are absorbed.

'But you say you are eager to
hear more. You would be more than eager if you knew the destination I am trying to
bring you to.'

I asked what it was and she told me that
it was true happiness.

'Your mind dreams of
it,' she said, 'but your sight is clouded by shadows of
happiness and cannot see reality.'

I begged her to lead on and show me the
nature of true happiness without delay.

'For you,' she said,
'I will do so gladly.

'But first I will try to
describe and sketch an idea of the cause of happiness. Then, with a proper vision of
that, you will be able to turn your gaze in a different direction and recognize the
pattern of true happiness.

She stood gazing at the ground for a
while, as if she had retreated into the recesses of thought, and then began to speak
again.

'In all the care with which
they toil at countless enterprises, mortal men travel by different paths, though all
are striving to reach one and the same goal, namely, happiness, beatitude, which is
a good which once obtained leaves nothing more to be desired. It is the perfection
of all good things and contains in itself all that is good; and if anything were
missing from it, it couldn't be perfect, because something would remain
outside it, which could still be wished for. It is clear, therefore, that happiness
is a state made perfect by the presence of everything that is good, a state, which,
as we said, all mortal men are striving to reach though by different paths. For the
desire for true good is planted by nature in the minds of men, only error leads them
astray towards false good.

'Some men believe that perfect
good consists in having no wants, and so they toil in order to end up rolling in
wealth. Some think that the true good is that which is most worthy of respect, and
so []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000679}struggle for position in order to be held in respect by their
fellow citizens. Some decide that it lies in the highest power, and either want to
be rulers themselves, or try to attach themselves to those in power. Others think
that the best thing is fame and busy themselves to make a name in the arts of war or
peace. But most people measure the possession of the good by the amount of enjoyment
and delight it brings, convinced that being abandoned to pleasure is the highest
form of happiness. Others again confuse ends and means with regard to these things,
such as people who desire riches for the sake of power and pleasure, or those who
want power for the sake of money or fame. So it is in these and other such
objectives that the aim of human activity and desire is to be found, in fame and
popularity which appear to confer a kind of renown, or in a wife and children which
men desire for the sake of the pleasure they give. And as for friendship, the purest
kind is counted as a mark not of good fortune, but of moral worth, but all other
friendship is cultivated for the sake of power or pleasure.

'Now, it is clear that
physical endowments are aspects of higher blessings: for clearly bodily strength and
size give a man might; beauty and speed give him renown; and health gives him
pleasure. And through all of this it is clear that the only thing men desire is
happiness. Each man considers whatever he desires above all else to be the supreme
good. We have already defined the supreme good as happiness; so that the state which
each man desires above all others is judged by him to be one of happiness. So you
have before you the general pattern of human happiness -- wealth, position,
power, fame, pleasure. Taking only these into consideration, Epicurus with perfect
consistency stated that pleasure was the highest good, because all the others bring
the mind enjoyment.

'But to return to the pursuits
of men. Inspite of a clouded memory, the mind seeks its own good, though like a
drunkard it cannot find the path home. No one would say that people who strive to
have all they want are wrong. In fact there is no other thing which could so
successfully create happiness as a condition provided with all that []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000682}is good, a condition of self-sufficiency and with no wants. No
one again would say those people are wrong who think that that which is most worthy
of respect and veneration is the best. It is no cheap and contemptible thing the
possession of which is the object of the exertions of almost all mankind. Power,
too, must be counted among the things that are good. For something which is agreed
to be superior to all things can scarcely be considered weak and impotent. And,
again, fame can't be considered valueless. It can't be ignored
because anything that is of great excellence is also of great renown. It is
irrelevant to say that happiness is a state free from anxiety, sadness, and the
domination of grief and suffering, when even in small matters, what men look for is
something which gives delight by its possession and enjoyment.

'These, then, are the things
which people long to obtain. And they want riches, position, estates, glory and
pleasures, because it is their conviction that through them they will achieve
self-sufficiency, respect, power, celebrity and happiness. This is the good that men
are looking for in such a variety of pursuits. And it is not difficult to show the
hand of nature in this, since in spite of the variety and difference of their
opinions, men are agreed in their choice of the good as their goal.

##### III {#chapter003.xhtml_con0000686 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

'You earthly creatures, you
also dream of your origin, however faint the vision. You do have some sort of
notion, unclear as it is, of the true goal of happiness, and so an instinctive sense
of direction actually guides you towards the true good, only various errors lead you
[]{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000688}astray. Consider, therefore, whether men really can reach
their appointed goal by the means with which they think they are going to win
happiness or beatitude. If money or position or the rest do bring some sort of
condition which doesn't seem to lack any of the good things, I will join
you in admitting that some people do become happy through the possession of them.
But if money and the rest can't achieve what they promise and are actually
lacking in the greater number of good things, it will be quite obvious that in them
men are snatching at a false appearance of happiness.

'So first I will ask you a few
questions, since you yourself were a wealthy man not long ago. In the midst of all
that great store of wealth, was your mind never troubled by worry arising from a
feeling that something was wrong?'

'Yes it was,' I
replied; 'in fact I can't remember when my mind was ever free
from some sort of worry.'

'And that was either because
something was missing which you didn't want to be missing, or because
something was present which you would have preferred not to have been
present.'

'Yes.'

'You wanted the presence of
one thing and the absence of another?'

'Yes.'

'Now a man must be lacking
something if he misses it, mustn't he?'

'Yes.'

'And if a man lacks something
he is not in every way self-sufficient?'

'No.'

'And so you felt this
insufficiency even though you were supplied with wealth?'

'Yes, I did.'

'So that wealth cannot make a
man free of want and self-sufficient, though this was the very promise we saw it
offering. And this, too, I think, is a point of great importance, namely the fact
that money has no inherent property such as to stop it being taken away from those
who possess it, against their will.'

I had to agree.

[]{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000704}'You can
hardly do otherwise,' she continued, 'when it can happen that
someone takes it from another against his will because he is stronger. What else are
the lawsuits for except to recover moneys that have been stolen by fraud or
violence?'

'That is true.'

'So that a man will need
outside help to protect his money.'

'Yes.'

'But he won't need
it if he doesn't possess any money which may be lost?'

'No.'

'So the situation has been
reversed. Wealth which was thought to make a man self-sufficient in fact makes him
dependent on outside help. In which case, what is the way in which riches remove
want? If you say that rich people do have the means of satisfying hunger and driving
away thirst and cold, I will reply that although want can be checked in this way by
riches, it can't be entirely removed. Every hungry and clamorous want may
be satisfied with the help of riches, but the want which admits of being satisfied
necessarily still remains. There is no need for me to mention that nature is
satisfied with little, whereas nothing satisfies greed. So that, if so far from
being able to remove want, riches create a want of their own, there is no reason for
you to believe that they confer self-sufficiency.

##### IV {#chapter003.xhtml_con0000713 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

'But it is said, when a man
comes to high office, that makes him worthy of honour and respect. Surely such
offices don't have the power of planting virtue in the minds of those who
hold them, do they? Or of removing vices? No: the opposite is true. More often than
removing wickedness, high office brings it to light, and this is the reason why we
are angry at seeing how often high office has devolved upon the most wicked of men
--why Catullus calls [Nonius](#appendix002.xhtml_g92){#chapter003.xhtml_p92} a
kind of malignant growth, in spite of the office he held.
[^2^](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001392){#chapter003.xhtml_con0000715}

'Surely you can see how much
disgrace high office heaps upon the evil? If they don't become famous
because of appointments to high office, their unworthiness will be less conspicuous.
And was it possible that so much danger could lead you, too, at long last to think
of taking office along with [Decoratus](#appendix002.xhtml_g48){#chapter003.xhtml_p48}?
[^3^](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001395){#chapter003.xhtml_con0000717}
Surely you could see he had a thoroughly evil mind, the mind of a parasite and
informer? We can scarcely consider men worthy of respect on account of the offices
they hold, if we judge them unworthy of those offices! But if you saw a man endowed
with wisdom, you would hardly think []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000718}him unworthy of respect or
of the wisdom he was endowed with, would you?'

'No.'

'Because virtue has her own
individual worth, which she immediately transfers to whoever possesses her. But as
public offices cannot do this, it is clear that they have no beauty or worth of
their own.

'There is another point we
should especially note: if a man is the more worthless the more widely he is
despised, then, since high office displays men to the public gaze, but cannot make
them worthy of respect, it makes them instead more despised. But not with impunity;
for wicked men confer a like return on the offices they hold: they discredit them
through contact with themselves.

'But I want you to see how
true respect cannot be obtained through the insubstantial honours of high office;
take the example of a man who has been consul many times and comes by chance among
foreign peoples: would his offices make him respected by them? If it were a natural
property of high offices, they would never fail to have this effect anywhere in the
world, just as anywhere on earth fire is always hot. But as it is the false opinion
of men that connects them with this function and not some inherent property,
immediately they reach people who don't consider them honours, they come
to nothing.

'This is what happens among
foreigners. But do they last for ever in the country of their origin? There was a
time when the praetorship was an office of great power, but now it is no more than
an empty name and a heavy burden on the pockets of the senatorial class. And once
upon a time if a man had charge of the corn supplies, he was considered a great man,
but now no office is lower. For as we said just now, if a thing has no beauty of its
own, its dignity varies at different times according to the opinion of the people
who use it.

'If, therefore, high offices
cannot make people worthy of respect and if, furthermore, they become tarnished by
contact with evil men; if their splendour can disappear with the change of time and
they grow cheap in the estimation of foreign peoples, without asking []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000725}what beauty they can confer, what beauty worth desiring do they
even possess?

##### V {#chapter003.xhtml_con0000727 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

'Can being a king or being the
friend of a king give a man power? If the answer is ''Yes,
because their happiness endures uninterrupted,'' I shall reply
that history, and our own times too, is full of examples of kings who exchanged
happiness for ruin. What a splendid thing power is, when we find it insufficient
even for its own preservation!

'Now, if kingly power is a
source of happiness, any deficiency in it means a diminution of happiness and the
introduction of unhappiness, doesn't it? Whatever the size of human
empires, it is inevitable that many people are left unruled by any king. And
wherever the power that makes men happy comes to an end, lack of power enters and
makes them wretched. So that there necessarily exists among kings a larger share of
misery. [Dionysius](#appendix002.xhtml_g50){#chapter003.xhtml_p50} the Tyrant of
Syracuse knew well enough the dangers of his position, when he illustrated the fears
of kingship to [Damocles](#appendix002.xhtml_g47){#chapter003.xhtml_p47} by making a
sword dangle over his head by a single hair.

'What is this power, then,
which cannot banish the nagging of worry or avoid the pin-prick of fear? Kings would
like to live free from worry, but they can't. And then they boast of their
power! Do you think of a man as powerful when you see him lacking something []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000731}which he cannot achieve? A man who goes about with a bodyguard
because he is more afraid than the subjects he terrorizes, and whose claim to power
depends on the will of those who serve him?

'And what should I say of the
friends of kings, when I can show that kingship itself is full of such weakness?
They are often brought down while the royal power remains unimpaired, but often too
when it collapses. The decision to commit suicide was forced upon Seneca by the very
[Nero](#appendix002.xhtml_g89){#chapter003.xhtml_p89} whose friend and mentor he had
been. And [Papinian](#appendix002.xhtml_g99){#chapter003.xhtml_p99} who had long been a
power in the court was thrown to the soldiers' swords by Caracalla.
[^4^](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001398){#chapter003.xhtml_con0000733}
Each of them was willing to give up his power. Seneca even tried to give his
money to Nero and go into retirement. But like men who lose their footing and are
pulled down by their own weight, neither was able to achieve what he wanted.

'What sort of power is it,
then, that strikes fear into those who possess it, confers no safety on you if you
want it, and which cannot be avoided when you want to renounce it? There is no
support, either, in friends you acquire because of your good fortune rather than
your personal qualities. The friend that success brings you becomes your foe in time
of misfortune. And there is no evil more able to do you injury than a friend turned
foe.

'Fame, in fact, is a shameful
thing, and so often deceptive. Euripides was right to make Andromache cry out

> O Fame, o Fame! --many a
> man ere this\
> Of no account hast thou set up on high.
> [^6^](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001403){#chapter003.xhtml_con0000750}

Many, indeed, are the men who have
wrongly acquired fame through the false opinions of the people. There is nothing
more conceivably shameful than that. Men who are unjustifiably commended cannot but
blush at the praise they receive. And even if the praise is deserved, it cannot add
anything to the philosopher's feelings: he measures happiness not by
popularity, but by the true voice of his own conscience.

'If it is thought a fine
achievement to have spread this fame far and wide, it follows that it must be judged
shameful not to have spread one's fame. But, as I said just now, there
must of necessity be many peoples to whom the reputation of one single man can never
extend, so that you may consider a man famous, whom the next quarter of the globe
will never even have heard of. This is []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000753}why I don't
consider popularity worth mentioning in this list; its acquisition is fortuitous and
its retention continuously uncertain.

'As for the claim to nobility,
no one is blind to the vanity and worthlessness of that. If it derives from fame, it
is borrowed nobility, for it is clearly a kind of praise derived from the deeds of
one's parents. Fame is the product of praise, and it is logical that it is
those who are praised that become famous. Therefore the praise of someone else
cannot ennoble you unless you are famous in your own right. If there is anything
good in nobility, I think it is only this: that there is a necessary condition
imposed upon the noble not to fall short of the virtue of their ancestors.

'Of bodily pleasure I can think
of little to say. Its pursuit is full of anxiety and its fulfilment full of remorse.
Frequently, like a kind of reward for wickedness, it causes great illness and
unbearable pain for those who make it their source of enjoyment. I do not know what
happiness lies in its passions, but that the end of pleasure is sorrow is known to
everyone who cares to recall his own excesses. But if bodily pleasure can produce
happiness, there is no need to deny that animals are happy, since their whole aim in
life is directed towards []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000758}the fulfilment of bodily needs. The
pleasures derived from a wife and children are indeed most honest; but there is a
story all too natural that a certain man found his children tormentors. How painful
the condition of every such man is, there is no need to remind you, since you have
experienced such conditions yourself, and are still not free from anxiety. So I
agree with my Euripides when he said that the childless man was fortunate in his
misfortune.

##### VIII {#chapter003.xhtml_con0000766 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

'There is no doubt, then, that
these roads to happiness are side-tracks and cannot bring us to the destination they
promise. The evils with which they are beset are great, as I will briefly show you.
If you try to hoard money, you will have to take it by force. If you want to be
resplendent in the dignities of high office, you will have to grovel before the man
who bestows it: in your desire to outdo others in high honour you will have to
cheapen and humiliate yourself by begging. If you want power, you will have to
expose yourself to the plots of your subjects and run dangerous risks. If fame is
what you seek, you will find yourself on a hard road, drawn this way and that until
you are worn with care. Decide to lead a life of pleasure, and there will be no one
who will not reject you with scorn as the slave of that most worthless and brittle
master, the human body.

[]{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000769}'For think
how puny and fragile a thing men strive to possess when they set the good of the
body before them as their aim. As if you could surpass the elephant in size, the
bull in strength, or the tiger in speed! Look up at the vault of heaven: see the
strength of its foundation and the speed of its movement, and stop admiring things
that are worthless. Yet the heavens are less wonderful for their foundation and
speed than for the order that rules them.
[^8^](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001409){#chapter003.xhtml_con0000770}

'The sleek looks of beauty are
fleeting and transitory, more ephemeral than the blossom in spring. If, as Aristotle
said, we had the piercing eyesight of the mythical [Lynceus](#appendix002.xhtml_g81){#chapter003.xhtml_p81}

beautiful. It is due to the weak eyesight of the people who see you. Think how
excessive this desire for the good of the body is, when, as you know, all that you
admire can be reduced to nothing by three days of burning fever.

'The sum of all this is that
because they can neither produce the good they promise nor come to perfection by the
combination of all good, these things are not the way to happiness and cannot by
themselves make people happy.

'I have said enough to give a
picture of false happiness, and if you can see that clearly, the next thing is to
show what true happiness is like.'

'I do indeed see that
sufficiency has nothing to do with riches, or power with kingship, respect with
honours, glory with fame, or happiness with pleasures.'

'But have you grasped the
reasons for this?'

'I think I can see a glimmer
of them, but I would like to learn of them more clearly from you.'

'The reason is very clear.
That which is one and undivided is mistakenly subdivided and removed by men from the
state of truth and perfection to a state of falseness and imperfection. Do you
consider self-sufficiency as a state deficient in power?'

'Not at all.'

'Of course not; for if a being
had some weakness in some respect, it would necessarily need the help of something
else.'

I agreed.

'So that self-sufficiency and
power are of one and the same nature.'

'So it seems.'

'Would you then consider a
being of this kind beneath contempt, or on the contrary supremely worthy of
veneration?'

'The latter, there is no doubt
about it.'

'Then let us add the state of
being revered to sufficiency and power, that we may judge all three to be
one.'

'We must, if we care to admit
the truth.'

'What do you think, then,
would such a combination be unrecognized and unknown, or famous and renowned?
Granted that it lacks nothing, possesses all power, and is supremely worthy of
honour, ask yourself whether it would lack a glory which it cannot provide for
itself and therefore whether it seems of qualified merit.'

[]{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000815}'I can
only say that in view of its nature it would be unsurpassed in fame and
glory.'

'And consequently we may say
that fame, glory, renown is nothing different from the three we already
have.'

'Yes.'

'If there were, then, a being
self-sufficient, able to accomplish everything from its own resources, glorious and
worthy of reverence, surely it would also be supremely happy?'

'How any sorrow could approach
such a being is inconceivable: it must be admitted that provided the other qualities
are permanent, it will be full of happiness.'

'And for the same reason this
conclusion, too, is inescapable; sufficiency, power, glory, reverence and happiness
differ in name but not in substance.'

'Yes.'

'Human perversity, then, makes
divisions of that which by nature is one and simple, and in attempting to obtain
part of something which has no parts, succeeds in getting neither the part
-- which is nothing -- nor the whole, which they are not
interested in.'

'How does that
happen?'

'If a man pursues wealth by
trying to avoid poverty, he is not working to get power; he prefers being unknown
and unrecognized, and even denies himself many natural pleasures to avoid losing the
money he has got. But certainly no sufficiency is achieved this way, since he is
lacking in power and vexed by trouble; he is of no account because of his low
esteem, and is buried in obscurity. And if a man pursues only power, he expends
wealth, despises pleasures and honour without power, and holds glory of no account.
But you can see how much this man also lacks; at any one time he lacks the
necessaries of life and is consumed by worry, from which he cannot free himself, so
he ceases to be what he most of all wants to be, that is, powerful. A similar
argument can be applied to honour, glory, and pleasures, for, since any one of them
is the same as the others, []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000825}a man who pursues one of them to the
exclusion of the others, cannot even acquire the one he wants.'

'But suppose someone should
want to obtain them all at one and the same time.'

'Then he would be seeking the
sum of happiness. But do you think he would find it among these things which we have
shown to be unable to confer what they promise?'

'No, I
don't.'

'So that it is impossible to
find happiness among these things which are thought to confer each of the desired
states individually?'

'I agree, and no truer word
could be spoken.'

'Then there you have both the
nature and the cause of false happiness. Now turn your mind's eye in the
opposite direction and you will immediately see the true happiness that I
promised.'

'Even a blind man could see
it,' I said, 'and you revealed it just now when you were trying
to show the causes of false happiness. For unless I'm mistaken, true and
perfect happiness is that which makes a man self-sufficient, strong, worthy of
respect, glorious and joyful. And to show you that I have more than a superficial
understanding, without a shadow of doubt I can see that happiness to be true
happiness which, since they are all the same thing, can truly bestow any one of
them.'

'You are blessed in this
belief, my child, provided you add one thing.'

'What is that?'

'Do you think there is
anything among these mortal and degenerate things which could confer such a
state?'

'No, I don't, and
you have proved it as well as anyone could wish.'

'Clearly, therefore, these
things offer man only shadows of the true good, or imperfect blessings, and cannot
confer true and perfect good.'

'Yes.'

'Since then you have realized
the nature of true happiness and []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000840}seen its false imitations, what
remains now is that you should see where to find this true happiness.'

'Which is the very thing I
have long and eagerly been waiting for.'

'But since in the
*Timaeu*. my servant Plato was pleased to ask for divine help even over
small matters,
[^11^](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001417){#chapter003.xhtml_con0000843}
what do you think we ought to do now in order to be worthy of discovering the
source of that supreme good?'

'We ought to pray to the
Father of all things. To omit to do so would not be laying a proper
foundation.'

'Right,' she said,
and immediately began the following hymn.

'Since, then, you have seen the
form both of imperfect and of perfect good, I think we now have to show where this
perfect happiness is to be found.

'The first question to ask is,
I think, whether any good of the kind I defined a moment ago can exist in the
natural world. This will prevent our being led astray from the truth of the matter
before us by false and ill-founded reasoning. But the existence of this good and its
function as a kind of fountain-head of all good things cannot be denied; for
everything that is said to be imperfect is held to be so by the absence of
perfection. So that if a certain imperfection is visible in any class of things, it
follows that there is also a proportion of perfection in it. For if you do away with
perfection, it is impossible to imagine how that which is held to be imperfect could
exist. The natural world did not take its origin from that which was impaired and
incomplete, but issues from that which is unimpaired and perfect and then
degenerates into this fallen and worn out condition. But []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000856}we
showed just now that there is a certain imperfect happiness in perishable good, so
that there can be no doubt that a true and perfect happiness exists.'

'Which is a very sound and
true conclusion,' I said.

'As to where it is to be
found, then, you should think as follows. It is the universal understanding of the
human mind that God, the author of all things, is good. Since nothing can be
conceived better than God, everyone agrees that that which has no superior is good.
Reason shows that God is so good that we are convinced that His goodness is perfect.
Otherwise He couldn't be the author of creation. There would have to be
something else possessing perfect goodness over and above God, which would seem to
be superior to Him and of greater antiquity. For all perfect things are obviously
superior to those that are imperfect. Therefore, to avoid an unending argument, it
must be admitted that the supreme God is to the highest degree filled with supreme
and perfect goodness. But we have agreed that perfect good is true happiness; so
that it follows that true happiness is to be found in the supreme
God.'

'I accept that. There is
nothing in any way open to contradiction.'

'But,' she said,
'I must ask you to make sure that your approval of our statement that the
supreme God is to the highest degree filled with supreme good is unqualified and
final'

'How do you mean?' I
asked.

'By avoiding the assumption
that this Father of creation has received this supreme good with which He is said to
be filled from outside Himself, or that He possesses it by nature but in such a way
as would lead you to suppose that the substance
[^13^](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001420){#chapter003.xhtml_con0000863}
of God the possessor was a separate thing from the substance of the happiness
He possesses. If you thought that He received it from outside Himself, you would be
able to count the giver superior to the receiver. But we are in agreement that it is
right to consider God the most excellent of things.

'On the other hand, if
goodness is a natural property of God, but something logically distinct from Him,
whenever we speak of God as the author of creation, an able mind might be able to
imagine the existence of a power responsible for bringing together the two that were
separate.

'Finally, if one thing is
distinct from another, it cannot be the thing from which it is perceived to be
distinct. So that which by its own nature is something distinct from supreme good,
cannot be supreme good; but this is something we may not hold about Him to whom we
agree there is nothing superior. It is impossible for anything to be by nature
better than that from which it is derived. I would therefore conclude with perfect
logic that that which is the origin of all things is in its own substance supreme
good.'

'Perfectly
right.'

'But we have agreed that
supreme good is the same as happiness.'

'Yes.'

'So that we have to agree that
God is the essence of happiness.'

[]{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000871}'Your
premises are incontestable and I see that this inference follows upon
them.'

'Then consider whether this,
too, can be firmly accepted: that it is impossible for two supreme goods to exist
separate from one another. For it is clear that if the two goods are separate, the
one cannot be the other, so that neither could be perfect when each is lacking to
the other. But that which is not perfect is obviously not supreme. It is therefore
impossible for there to be two separate supreme goods. However, we deduced that both
happiness and God are supreme goodness, so that it follows that supreme happiness is
identical with supreme divinity.'

'There could scarcely be a
conclusion more true to reality, or more sure in its reasoning, or more worthy of
God.'

'I will add something to it.
Just as in geometry some additional inference may be drawn from a theorem that has
been proved, called in technical language, in Greek a *porism*. and in Latin
a corollary, I too will give you a kind of corollary. Since it is through the
possession of happiness that people become happy, and since happiness is in fact
divinity, it is clear that it is through the possession of divinity that they become
happy. But by the same logic as men become just through the possession of justice,
or wise through the possession of wisdom, so those who possess divinity necessarily
become divine. Each happy individual is therefore divine. While only God is so by
nature, as many as you like may become so by participation.'

'What you say is beautiful and
valuable, whether you give it the Greek or the Latin name.'

'But the most beautiful thing
is what logic leads us to add to all this.'

'What is that?'

'Are all the many things we
see included under the word happiness like parts combining to form a single body,
yet separate in their variety, or is there any one of them which can fully supply
the essence of happiness and under which the others may be classed?'

'Could you clarify the
question by being more specific?'

[]{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000881}'Well, we
consider happiness something good, don't we?'

'Yes, the supreme
good.'

'You could say the same of all
of them. Absolute sufficiency is judged to be the same as happiness, and so too are
power, reverence, glory and pleasure. Well, the question is this, all these things
-- sufficiency, power and the others -- are they good as if
happiness were a body of which they were members, or is goodness something
superordinate to which they belong?'

'I understand the question
which you are proposing we should ask, but I should like to hear what your answer
would be.'

'This is how I would resolve
it. If all these were related to happiness like limbs to a body, they would differ
from one another, because it is the nature of parts that the body is one, but the
parts that make it up are diverse. But all these things have been proved to be
identical. So that they are not like limbs. Moreover it would appear that happiness
was a body made up of a single limb, which is impossible.'

'There is no doubt of that;
but I am eager for what is to come.'

'It is clear that the other
properties are classed under good. It is just because sufficiency is judged a good
that people want it, and it is just because it too is believed to be a good that
power is sought after. And exactly the same conclusion may be reached about
reverence, glory and pleasure.

'The chief point and reason,
therefore, for seeking all things is goodness. For it is quite impossible for that
which contains no good in itself whether real or apparent, to be an object of
desire. On the other hand, things which are not good by nature are sought after if
they nevertheless seem as if they were truly good.

'The result is, therefore,
that there is justice in the belief that goodness is the chief point upon which the
pursuit of everything hinges and by which it is motivated. What seems most to be
desired is the thing that motivates the pursuit of something, as, for example, if a
man wants to go riding for the sake of health; it is not so much the motion of
horse-riding he desires as the resultant good health. Since, therefore, all things
are desired for the sake of the good in []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000890}them, no one desires
them as much as the good itself. But we are agreed that the reason for desiring
things is happiness. So that it is patently obvious that the good itself and
happiness are identical.'

'I can see no reason for
anyone to disagree.'

'But we have shown that God
and happiness are one and the same thing.'

'Yes.'

'We may safely conclude, then,
that God is to be found in goodness itself and nowhere else.

##### XI {#chapter003.xhtml_con0000896 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

'I agree, for all that you have
said is established and connected by the soundest of reasoning.'

Then she asked, 'How valuable
would you think it if you could come to know the good itself?'

'Infinitely
valuable,' I said, 'if I should also be able to see God, who is
the good.'

'I will make it clear with
unimpeachable reasoning,' she said, 'provided our recent
conclusions may stand.'

'They may,' I
said.

'We have proved, then,
haven't we, that the various things that the majority of men pursue are
not perfect and good, for the reason that they differ from one another, and because
they are lacking to one another and cannot confer full and perfect good. On the
other hand, true good does come about when they are brought together into one form
and efficient power, as it were, so that sufficiency becomes identical with power,
reverence, glory and pleasure; unless all are one and the same thing they have no
claim to be included among worthwhile objects of pursuit.'

'You have proved it and there
is no room at all for doubt.'

'When these objects differ,
they're not good, but when they begin to be one they become good; so it
comes about that it is through the acquisition of unity that these things are good,
doesn't it?'

'It seems so.'

'But do you or do you not
agree that everything that is good is so through participation in
goodness?'

'I do agree.'

'Then you are obliged to agree
by the same argument that unity and goodness are identical. For things whose natural
effect is identical must have the same substance in common.'

'I cannot gainsay
it.'

'You know, then, that
everything that is remains and subsists just []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000911}so long as it is
one, but perishes and dissolves immediately it ceases to be one?'

'How is that?'

'It is just as with living
creatures: when soul and body come together and remain united, we speak of a living
being, but when this unity breaks up through the separation of either component, it
is clear that the living being perishes and no longer exists. The very body, too, so
long as it remains in one form through the combination of its members, you see a
human figure; but if the parts are divided up and separated and the body's
unity destroyed, it ceases to be what it was. You may run through every other thing
and it will be clear beyond a shadow of doubt that everything subsists as long as it
is one, but perishes when its unity ceases.'

'Yes, I can think of many
things of which this is true.'

'Now is there anything which
in the course of its natural activity loses the will to exist and desires to obtain
death and corruption?'

'If I confine my thoughts to
living creatures endowed by nature with freedom of choice, I can find nothing which
in the absence of external compulsion would give up the intention to live and
willingly hasten towards death. For every kind of animal is at pains to guard its
own safety, and shuns death and destruction. But in the case of plants and trees, I
am in some doubt as to what I would agree with.'

'And yet there is no room for
indecision here either, because you can see how in the first place plants and trees
grow up in places suitable to them and where it would be unnatural for them quickly
to wither and die. Some grow in fields, some on hills, some in marshes; some cling
to rocky ground and the barren desert abounds with others. And if you tried to
transplant them into other habitats, they would wither away. Nature gives each one
whatever suits it, and as long as life is possible toils to prevent them dying. Just
think how they all draw nourishment through their roots, as if they were burying
their mouths in the earth, and how strength spreads through their pith and bark. And
how the softest part like the pith is always buried inside, while the covering of
bark with the strength of the []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000918}wood is set on the outside to
withstand the inclemency of the weather, like a protector capable of enduring such
malice. And how painstaking Nature is to ensure that all things are propagated by
the multiplication of their seed. Everyone knows that they are like a kind of
machine not only for the duration of their own lifetime, but for the almost
everlasting propagation of their species.

'Even things which are
believed to be inanimate also desire in a similar way that which is their own,
don't they? Otherwise why is flame carried upwards by its lightness and
solid things carried down by their weight, except because these positions and
motions suit the individual things? Furthermore, that which is suitable to each
thing, they preserve, just as they destroy what is harmful. Things that are hard,
like stone, cohere with great tenacity throughout their parts and resist being
easily broken up. But fluids, like air and water, easily give way before a dividing
force, and easily reunite again with the parts that have been cut off; and fire
doesn't admit of being cut at all.

'We are not dealing with
willed motions of the conscious mind, but with instinctive motions, like the way we
digest the food we have taken without thinking about it, and the way we breathe in
our sleep without being conscious of it. Not even in living things is the love of
self-preservation due to the wishes of their mind, but to the principles of their
nature. For often when there are reasons which force death upon a creature, Nature
turns away in horror, but the will accepts it. And on the other hand, the work of
procreation which alone gives mortal creatures their continuity and which Nature
always desires, is sometimes curbed by the will. To such an extent does this love of
self-preservation stem not from conscious desire, but from natural instinct.
Providence has given its creatures one great reason to go on living, namely the
instinctive desire for the greatest possible self-preservation. There is no reason,
therefore, for you to have any doubt that all things have an instinctive desire to
preserve their life and avoid destruction.'

'I admit that what just now
seemed uncertain to me I can now see without any doubt.'

[]{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000923}'Now,
whatever seeks to subsist and remain alive desires to be one; take unity away from a
thing and existence too ceases.'

'That is true.'

'So that all things desire
unity.'

'Yes.'

'But we proved that unity is
identical with goodness.'

'Yes.'

'So that all things seek the
good, which you could describe by saying that it is goodness itself which all things
desire.'

'No truer conclusion could be
discovered. For either all things are inclined to no one thing and will wander about
aimlessly as though destitute of any head or helmsman to guide them, or if there is
something to which all things are inclined, it will be the sum of all
good.'

'I am very happy, my son, for
you have fixed in your mind the very mark of the central truth. And in this you have
revealed the very thing you were just now saying you did not know.'

'What was that?'

'What the end of all things
was. For certainly it is the same as that which all things desire; we have deduced
that that is goodness, and so we must agree that the end of all things is the
good.

Then I said, 'I agree very
strongly with Plato. This is the second time you have reminded me of these matters.
The first time was because I had lost the memory through the influence of the body,
and this second time because I lost it when I became overwhelmed by the weight of my
grief

'If you look at what we have
already agreed, you won't be far from remembering what you said you did
not know just now.'

'What was that?'

'The manner in which the world
is governed.'

[]{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000942}'I
remember admitting my ignorance, but even though I have some inkling of them I
should like to hear more plainly what arguments you would adduce.'

'Just now you thought it was
beyond doubt that this world was ruled by God.'

'I still do think it is beyond
doubt, and will always think so. I will briefly explain the arguments which convince
me in this matter.

'This world would never have
coalesced into one form out of such diverse and antagonistic parts had there not
been one who could unify such diversity. Their very diversity in turn would make
them break out into dissension and tear apart and destroy the unity of the world
unless there were a power capable of holding together what he had once woven.
Nature's fixed order could not proceed on its path and the various kinds
of change could not exhibit motions so orderly in place, time, effect, distance from
one another, and nature, unless there was one unmoving and stable power to regulate
them. For this power, whatever it is, through which creation remains in existence
and in motion, I use the word which all people use, namely God.'

Then she said, 'Since this is
your opinion, I think little remains for me to do before you acquire happiness and
return safe and sound to your true homeland.

'But let us look at the
arguments we have set forth. Under happiness we have included sufficiency,
haven't we, and we have agreed that God is happiness itself
?'

'Yes.'

'So that in regulating the
universe He will need no external assistance--otherwise, if He needs
anything, He won't have complete sufficiency.'

'The inference is
inescapable.'

'So that He regulates all
things by Himself?'

'It cannot be
denied.'

'Now, we have proved that God
is the good itself.'

[]{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000955}'Yes, I
remember.'

'So that it is by goodness
that He rules all things, since He rules them by Himself and we have agreed that He
is the good. It is this which is the helm and rudder, so to speak, by which the
fabric of the universe is kept constant and unimpaired.'

'I strongly agree; and this is
exactly what I thought you were going to say, although I wasn't sure of my
surmise.'

'I believe you,' she
said, 'for now, I think, you are bringing your eyes to look with greater
care upon the truth. And what I am going to say is no less clear to the
sight.'

'What is that?' I
asked.

'Since we are right in
thinking that God controls all things by the helm of goodness, and all things, as I
have said, have a natural inclination towards the good, it can hardly be doubted,
can it, that they are willingly governed and willingly obey the desires of him who
controls them, as things that are in harmony and accord with their
helmsman.'

'It is necessarily so, for it
would hardly seem a happy government if it were like a yoke imposed upon unwilling
necks instead of a willing acceptance of salvation.'

'There is nothing, therefore,
which could preserve its own nature as well as go against God.'

'Nothing.'

'If it did try, it
wouldn't make any progress against Him whom we have agreed to be, because
of His happiness, supreme in power.'

'No, it would be completely
powerless.'

'Is there anything, then,
which might either wish to be or be able to withstand this supreme
good?'

'I don't think
so.'

'It is the supreme good, then,
which mightily and sweetly orders all things.'

Then I said, 'The conclusion
of this highest of arguments has made me very happy, and I am even more happy
because of the []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000970}words you used.
[^15^](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001423){#chapter003.xhtml_con0000971}
I am now ashamed of the stupidity of all my railing.'

'You have no doubt heard how
in mythology the giants began attacking heaven,
[^16^](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001425){#chapter003.xhtml_con0000973}
and as was right, they, too, were kindly but firmly set to order. But would you
like us to bring about a conflict of arguments? Perhaps from a collision of this
kind some beautiful spark of truth might leap forth.'

'Whatever you
decide,' I said.

'No one could doubt that God
is omnipotent.'

'No one, at any rate, who is
in his right mind would have any doubt about it.'

'But there is nothing that an
omnipotent power could not do?'

'No.'

'Then, can God do
evil?'

'No.'

'So that evil is nothing,
since that is what He cannot do who can do anything.'

'You are playing with me,
aren't you, by weaving a labyrinth of arguments from which I
can't find the way out. At one moment you go in where you'll
come out, and at another you come out where you went in. Or are you creating a
wonderful circle of divine simplicity? Just now you began with happiness and said it
was the highest good, and you said it was to be found in God. Then you began arguing
that God Himself was also the supreme good and perfect happiness and added as a kind
of bonus that no one could be happy unless he was also divine. You said that the
very form of the good was identical with the substance of God and of happiness. And
you taught us that unity itself was the same as the good, because []{#chapter003.xhtml_con0000983}all things had a natural inclination to it. Then you argued that God rules the
universe by the helm of goodness, that all things obey willingly, and that evil is
nothing. All of which you unfolded without the help of any external aid, but with
one internal proof grafted upon another so that each drew its credibility from that
which preceded.'

Then she replied, 'I am not
mocking; through the favour of God whom we prayed to a moment ago, we have achieved
the greatest of all things. The form of the divine substance is such that it does
not spread out into outside things or take up into itself anything from them. As [Parmenides](#appendix002.xhtml_g100){#chapter003.xhtml_p100} says of it,

> like the mass of a sphere
> well-rounded in all ways
> [^17^](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001428){#chapter003.xhtml_con0000986}

it rotates the moving sphere of the
universe while remaining itself unmoved. If we have been dealing with arguments not
sought from without but within the bounds of the matter we have been discussing,
there is no reason for you to be surprised. You have learnt on the authority of
Plato that we must use language akin to the subject matter of our discourse.

##### I {#chapter004.xhtml_con0000995 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

Philosophy delivered this sweet and
gentle song with dignity of countenance and gravity of expression. But I had still
not forgotten the grief within me and I cut her short just as she was preparing to
say something.

'You,' I said,
'who are my leader towards the true light, all that you have poured forth
in speech up to now has been clearly both divine to contemplate and invincibly
supported by your arguments. You have spoken of things I had forgotten because of
the pain of what I had suffered, but before this they were not entirely unknown to
me.

'But the greatest cause of my
sadness is really this -- the fact that in spite of a good helmsman to
guide the world, evil can still exist and even pass unpunished. This fact alone you
must surely think of considerable wonder. But there is something even more
bewildering. When wickedness rules and flourishes, not only does virtue go
unrewarded, it is even trodden underfoot by the wicked and punished in the place of
crime. That this can happen in the realm of an omniscient and omnipotent God who
wills only good, is beyond perplexity and complaint.'

'It would indeed be a matter
of infinite wonder,' she said, 'it would be something more
horrible than any outrage, if, as you reckon, in the well-ordered house of so great
a father the worthless vessels were looked after at the expense of the precious
ones, which grew filthy. But it is not so.

'If your recent conclusions
may remain intact, you can learn from the Creator Himself since it is His realm we
are speaking of, that the good are always strong and the wicked always humbled and
[]{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001001}weak. From Him, too, you can learn that sin never goes
unpunished or virtue unrewarded, and that what happens to the good is always happy
and that what happens to the bad always misfortune. There are many other
considerations of this kind which, once your complaints have been stilled, will give
you firm and solid strength.

'You have seen the shape of
true happiness when I showed it to you just now, and you saw where it is to be
found; and when we have run through all that I think we should clear out of the way
beforehand, I will show you the path that will bring you back home. I will give your
mind wings on which to lift itself; all disquiet shall be driven away and you will
be able to return safely to your homeland. I will be your guide, your path and your
conveyance.

##### II {#chapter004.xhtml_con0001007 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

Then I cried out in wonder at the
magnitude of her promises. 'Not that I don't think you can do
it,' I said. 'Only do not keep me waiting, now that you have
whetted my appetite.'

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001010}'First
then,' she said, 'that the good are always strong and that the
wicked always bereft of all power, these are facts you will be able to see, the one
being proved by the other. For since good and evil are opposites, the weakness of
evil is shown by establishing the strength of good, and vice versa. So to strengthen
your confidence in my teaching, I will proceed along both ways and prove my
assertions doubly.

'Now, there are two things on
which all the performance of human activity depends, will and power. If either of
them is lacking, there is no activity that can be performed. In the absence of the
will, a man is unwilling to do something and therefore does not undertake it; and in
the absence of the power to do it, the will is useless. So that if you see someone
who wants to get something which he cannot get, you can be sure that what he has
been lacking is the power to get what he wanted.'

'It is obvious,' I
said, 'and cannot be denied.'

'And if you see a man who has
done what he wanted, you will hardly doubt that he had the power to do it, will
you?'

'No.'

'Therefore, men's
power or ability is to be judged by what they can do, and their weakness by what
they can't do.'

'I agree.'

'Do you, then, remember how
earlier in the argument we reached the conclusion that the instinctive direction of
the human will, manifested through a variety of pursuits, was entirely towards
happiness?'

'I remember that this was
proved as well.'

'And you recall that happiness
is the good itself and similarly that since they seek happiness, all men desire the
good?'

'Not so much recall it, as
hold it fixed in my mind.'

'So that without any
difference of instinct all men, good and bad alike, strive to reach the
good.'

'Yes, that
follows.'

'But surely men become good by
acquiring goodness?'

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001025}'Yes.'

'So that good men obtain what
they are looking for?'

'It seems so.'

'But if the wicked obtained
what they want -- that is goodness -- they could not be
wicked?'

'No.'

'Since, then, both groups want
goodness, and one obtains it and the other doesn't, surely there can be no
doubt of the power of the good and the weakness of the bad?'

'Anyone who does doubt it is
no judge either of reality or the logic of argument.'

'Again,' she said,
'suppose there were two men who are set the same natural task, and one of
them performs and completes it by natural action, while the other cannot manage the
natural action, but uses another method contrary to nature, and does not actually
complete the task but approximates to someone completing it; which would you say had
the more power?'

'I can guess what you
mean,' I said, 'but I would like to have it more clearly
put.'

'You will not deny that the
action of walking is natural and human, will you?'

'No.'

'And presumably you have no
doubt that it is the natural function of the feet?'

'No, indeed.'

'If, then, one man is able to
proceed on foot and goes walking, and another lacks the natural function of the feet
and tries to walk on his hands, which may properly be considered the more able or
powerful?'

'Ask me another! No one could
doubt that the man who can do the natural action is more able than the one who
can't.'

'Well, the supreme good is the
goal of good men and bad alike, and the good seek it by means of a natural activity
-- the exercise of their virtues -- while the bad strive to
acquire the very same thing []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001041}by means of their various desires,
which isn't a natural method of obtaining the good. Or don't you
agree?'

'Yes, for what follows is also
obvious; from what I have already admitted it follows that the good are powerful and
the bad weak.'

'You anticipate correctly. As
the doctors like to think, it is a sign of a constitution strong and fighting back.
But seeing you are so quick of understanding, I will pile the arguments on. Just
think how great the weakness is that we see in wicked men; they can't even
reach the goal to which almost by compulsion their natural inclination leads them.
What if they were deserted by this great and almost invincible help, and nature
ceased to show them the way?

'Think of the extent of the
weakness impeding the wicked. It is not as if the prizes they failed to win were
mere sports trophies. The quest in which they fail is the quest for the highest and
most important of all things, and success is denied these wretched men in the very
pursuit they toil at night and day to the exclusion of all else, the same pursuit in
which the strength of the good stands out.

'If a man by walking could
reach a point beyond which there was nowhere for him to go, you would consider him
the champion at walking. In the same way you must judge the man who achieves the
goal of all endeavour, beyond which there is nothing, to be supreme in power. The
opposite of this is also true; those who do not gain it
[^2^](#chapter004-fn.xhtml_con0001439){#chapter004.xhtml_con0001046}
are obviously lacking in all power.

'For I ask you, what is the
cause of this flight from virtue to vice? If you say it is because they do not know
what is good, I shall ask what greater weakness is there than the blindness of
ignorance. And if you say that they know what they ought to seek for, but pleasure
sends them chasing off the wrong way, this way too, they are weak through lack of
self control because they cannot resist vice. And if []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001048}you say
they abandon goodness and turn to vice knowingly and willingly, this way they not
only cease to be powerful, but cease to be at all. Men who give up the common goal
of all things that exist, thereby cease to exist themselves. Some may perhaps think
it strange that we say that wicked men, who form the majority of men, do not exist;
but that is how it is. I am not trying to deny the wickedness of the wicked; what I
do deny is that their existence is absolute and complete existence. Just as you
might call a corpse a dead man, but couldn't simply call it a man, so I
would agree that the wicked are wicked, but could not agree that they have
unqualified existence. A thing exists when it keeps its proper place and preserves
its own nature. Anything which departs from this ceases to exist, because its
existence depends on the preservation of its nature.

'To the objection that evil
men do have power, I would say that this power of theirs comes from weakness rather
than strength. For they would not have the power to do the evil they can if they
could have retained the power of doing good. This power only makes it more clear
that they can do nothing, for if, as we concluded a short time ago, evil is nothing,
it is clear that since they can only do evil, the wicked can do
nothing.'

'Obviously.'

'But I want you to understand
the exact nature of the power we are talking about. A moment ago we decided that
there is nothing with greater power than the supreme good.'

'That is so.'

'But supreme goodness cannot
do evil.'

'No.'

'Now, no one thinks of human
beings as omnipotent, do they?'

'Not unless they are
mad.'

'But men can do
evil?'

'I only wish they
couldn't.'

'It is obvious, therefore,
that since a power that can only do good is omnipotent, while human beings who can
also do evil are not, []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001060}these same human beings who can do evil
are less powerful. In addition to this we have shown that all forms of power are to
be included among those things worth pursuing, and that all these worthwhile objects
of pursuit are related to the good as to a kind of supreme exemplar of their nature.
Now, the ability to commit a crime cannot be a form of goodness, and is therefore
not worth pursuing. But all forms of power are worth seeking after, so that it is
obvious that the ability to do evil is not a form of power.

'From all this the power of
good men is obvious and, beyond all doubt, so is the weakness of bad men. And it is
clear that what Plato said in the *Gorgias*
[^3^](#chapter004-fn.xhtml_con0001442){#chapter004.xhtml_con0001062}
is true, namely that only the wise can achieve their desire, while the wicked
busy themselves with what gives pleasure without being able to achieve their real
objective. Their actions depend on the belief that they are going to obtain the good
they desire through the things that give them pleasure. But they do not obtain it,
because evil things cannot reach happiness.

'High kings you see sit
loftily on thrones, In purple bright, by sober arms enhedged, With savage threat in
passion's breathless rage; Once strip from pride their robes of empty
show, And see within the straitening fetters worn: Here lust o'erthrows
the heart with poisonous greed, Here like a wave wrath whips and bears off sense,
Here captive sorrow sits or hope torments; Here in one heart so many tyrants rule,
The king's own will's deposed, the enslaver
slaved.'

##### III {#chapter004.xhtml_con0001064 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

'You can see, therefore, the
filth in which crime wallows and the light in which goodness is resplendent. It is
clear that good deeds never lack reward, or crimes their appropriate punishment. The
proper way of looking at it is to regard the goal of every action as its reward,
just as the prize for running in the stadium is the wreath of laurels for which the
race is run. Now, we have shown that happiness is the very same good which motivates
all activity; so that goodness itself is set as a kind of common reward of human
activity. But goodness cannot be removed from those who are good; therefore,
goodness never fails to receive its appropriate reward. So despite all the raging of
the wicked, the wise man's crown of laurels will never fall from him or
wither away. The wickedness of others can never wrest their individual glory from
the good. If it was a borrowed glory that we prided ourselves upon, other people
including the very one who conferred it on us could take it away; but since the
glory is conferred on each one by his own goodness he will only lose his reward when
he stops being good.

'Finally since every reward is
desired because it is believed to be good, no one will consider a man endowed with
goodness to be without reward. But what kind of reward? The greatest and most
beautiful of all. Think again of that corollary I emphasized to you a short time
ago, and consider it this way. Goodness is happiness, and therefore it is obvious
that all good men obtain happiness in virtue of their being good. But we agree that
those who attain happiness are divine. The reward of the good, then, a reward that
can never be decreased, that no one's power can diminish, and no
one's wickedness darken, is to become gods. This being so, no wise man can
be in any doubt of the inevitability of the punishment of the wicked. Like good and
evil, reward and punishment are opposites. There ward we see due to the good must be
balanced by a corresponding punishment of the wicked. Therefore, just as goodness is
its own []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001067}reward, so the punishment of the wicked is their very
wickedness. Now, no one who suffers a punishment doubts that he suffers something
evil. So, if they are willing to examine themselves, I do not think men can consider
themselves immune from punishment when they suffer the worst evil of all: evil is
not so much an infliction as a deep set infection.

'Again, think of the
punishment that dogs the wicked from the opposite point of view of the good. A short
while ago you learned that all that exists is in a state of unity and that goodness
itself is unity; from which it follows that we must see everything that exists as
good. This means that anything which turns away from goodness ceases to exist, and
thus that the wicked cease to be what they once were. That they used to be human is
shown by the human appearance of their body which still remains. So it was by
falling into wickedness that they also lost their human nature. Now, since only
goodness can raise a man above the level of human kind, it follows that it is proper
that wickedness thrusts down to a level below mankind those whom it has dethroned
from the condition of being human.

'The result is that you cannot
think of anyone as human whom you see transformed by wickedness. You could say that
someone who robs with violence and burns with greed is like a wolf. A wild and
restless man who is for ever exercising his tongue in lawsuits could be compared to
a dog yapping. A man whose habit is to lie hidden in an ambush and steal by trapping
people would be likened to a fox. A man of quick temper has only to roar to gain the
reputation of a lion-heart. The timid coward who is terrified when there is nothing
to fear is thought to be like the hind. The man who is lazy, dull and stupid, lives
an ass's life. A man of whimsy and fickleness who is for ever changing his
interests is just like a bird. And a man wallowing in foul and impure lusts is
occupied by the filthy pleasures of a sow. So what happens is that when a man
abandons goodness and ceases to be human, being unable to rise to a divine
condition, he sinks to the level of being an animal.

##### IV {#chapter004.xhtml_con0001074 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

Then I said, 'I agree, and I
see the justice of saying that though they retain the outward appearance of the
human body, wicked people change into animals with regard to their state of mind.
But I could have wished that no freedom was allowed to the fury of cruel and
wicked-minded men to bring destruction on the good.'

'It's not a question
of freedom,' she said, 'as I will show at the appropriate point.
But supposing the freedom they are believed to enjoy were removed, it would to a
large extent mean relieving criminals of their punishment. It may seem incredible to
some, but it must be the case that the wicked are less happy if they achieve their
desires than if they are unable to do what they want. For, if desiring something
wicked brings misery, greater misery is brought by having had the power to do it,
without which the unhappy desire would go unfulfilled. So, since each stage has its
own degree of misery, if you see people with the desire to do something wicked, the
power to do it and the achievement, they must necessarily suffer a triple degree of
misfortune.'

'Yes, I agree: but I hope very
much that they will soon be released from this misfortune by losing the power to do
evil'

'They will be released sooner
than perhaps you would wish or []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001079}they themselves expect. For in
the very short space of a human life, nothing can be so late in coming as to seem to
the mind long to wait for, especially as it is immortal. Their great hope and their
ambitious blue-print of crime is often destroyed by a sudden and unexpected end,
which does at least impose a limit on their misery. For if wickedness is the cause
of their misery, it follows that their wickedness makes them the more wretched the
longer it lasts. If death did not at last end their evil, I would count them the
unhappiest of men. For obviously if our conclusions about the misfortune of
wickedness are true, any misery which is agreed to be everlasting is
infinite.'

'It is a strange thing to
conclude and hard to accept, but I do see that it fits in with our previous
admissions.'

'You are right,' she
said, 'but if someone thinks a particular conclusion hard to accept, he
ought to show either that some false assumption has preceded it or that the way the
arguments have been marshalled does not necessarily produce the conclusion.
Otherwise, provided he agrees to what has preceded, there is absolutely no ground
for arguing about the conclusion. What I am going to say may also seem no less
strange, but it is an equally necessary conclusion from our
assumptions.'

'What is it?' I
asked.

'That the wicked are happier
if they suffer punishment than if they are unrestrained by any just retribution. And
I do not have in mind what you may think, namely that wickedness is corrected by
punishment and returned to the path of right by the fear of punishment, and is also
an example to others to avoid punishable actions. No, I think there is another way
in which the wicked are more unhappy if they go unpunished, apart from any
consideration of the corrective effect of punishment or its value as a deterrent to
others.'

'What other way is
there?'

'Well, we have agreed,
haven't we, that the good men are happy and the bad
unhappy?'

'Yes.'

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001088}'Now, if
someone's misery is offset by something good, he is happier than someone
else whose misery is pure and undiluted by any admixture of good, isn't
he?'

'So it seems.'

'What if that same unhappy
person, who has no share of anything good, should receive some further evil in
addition to those that have caused his unhappiness, he would have to be considered
far more unhappy, wouldn't he, than the one whose misfortune is lessened
by a share of good?'

'Of course.'

'Now, obviously the punishment
of the wicked is just, and their escape from punishment unjust.'

'No one would deny
that.'

'And no one will deny, too,
that what is just is good, and on the other hand, what is unjust is
bad.'

I agreed it was obvious.

'So when the wicked receive
punishment they receive something good, the punishment itself, which is good,
because of its justice; but when they go unpunished they acquire some extra evil in
actually going scot free, which you have agreed is bad, because of its
injustice.'

'I cannot deny
it.'

'So the wicked are much more
unhappy when they are unjustly allowed to go scot free, than when a just punishment
is imposed upon them.'

'It is the logical outcome of
our previous conclusion. But, I ask you, don't you leave any punishment of
the soul until after the death of the body?'

'There is, indeed, great
punishment then, sometimes exacted with penal severity, sometimes, I think, with
purifying mercy; but it is not my intention to discuss it now.

'We have followed the argument
as far as we have for you to see that what you thought of as the entirely undeserved
power of the wicked is no power at all. I wanted you to see that those whose freedom
from punishment you were complaining of do not at all []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001102}escape
paying for their wickedness. That freedom of theirs for whose speedy end you were
praying doesn't last long and will be the more miserable the longer it
continues. It will be most miserable of all if it is endless. And lastly, the wicked
are more wretched when unjustly absolved from punishment than when they receive a
just retribution. The logical conclusion of this is that they are burdened with
heavier punishment precisely when they are believed to escape it.'

Then I said, 'When I consider
your arguments, I think nothing more true could be spoken. But when I turn to the
opinions of ordinary men, few would even grant you a hearing, let alone believe
you.'

'It is true,' she
said. 'Their eyes are used to the dark and they cannot raise them to the
shining light of truth. They are like birds whose sight is sharpened by night and
blinded by day. So long as they look only at their own desires and not the order of
creation, they think of freedom to commit crimes and the absence of punishment as
happy things. But let us see what is decreed by everlasting law: if you have turned
your mind to higher things, there is no need of a judge to award a prize; it is you
yourself who have brought yourself to a more excellent state: but if you have
directed your zeal towards lower things, do not look for punishment from without; it
is you yourself who have plunged yourself into the worse condition -- just
as if you look by turns at the sky and the dirt of the earth, and everything else
disappears and you seem at one moment to be in the mud and at the next moment among
the stars, just by the action of looking. But ordinary people do not see such
things.

'Well, are we to join these
people whom we have shown to be like animals? What about the case of a man who
completely lost his sight and even forgot he had ever had it and thought that he had
everything that belonged to human perfection; would we who had sight think the same
as the blind man?

'And there is something else
equally well founded on a firm base of argument which they will not agree with,
namely that those who commit an injustice are more unhappy than those who suffer
it.'

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001108}'I would
like to hear the argument.'

'Well, I presume you do not
deny that every wicked man deserves punishment?'

'No.'

'And it is abundantly clear
that the wicked are unhappy?'

'Yes.'

'Therefore you would not doubt
the unhappiness of those who deserve punishment?'

'No.'

'Suppose, then, you were
sitting in judgment in the law courts; on whom would you decide to pass sentence,
the man who had committed the wrong, or the man who had suffered it?'

'I have no hesitation in
saying I would satisfy the one who had suffered at the expense of the one who had
done it.'

'So you would think the
perpetrator of the injury more wretched than the victim?'

'It follows.'

'For this and other reasons
based on the fact that by its own nature badness makes men wretched, it is clear
that when someone is done an injury, the misery belongs not to the victim but to the
perpetrator.^[5](#chapter004-fn.xhtml_conx02){#chapter004.xhtml_conx04}^

'But the court orators of
today take the opposite course; they try to excite the sympathy of the court for
those who have suffered some grievous and painful injury, although a juster sympathy
is more due to those who are guilty. They ought to be brought to justice not by a
prosecution counsel with an air of outrage, but by a prosecution kind and
sympathetic, like sick men being brought to the doctor, so that their guilt could be
cut back by punishment like a malignant growth. In this way the work of the defence
counsel would either completely come to a standstill, or, if they chose to benefit
mankind, they would turn to the job of accusation. And the wicked themselves, if
through some crack they were allowed a []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001121}Glimpse of the virtue
they had abandoned, if they could see themselves about to lay aside the filth of
vice through the pains of punishment, they would no longer consider them to be pains
because of the compensation of acquiring goodness, and they would refuse the
services of defence counsels and give themselves up wholly to their accusers and
judges.

'This is why among wise men
there is no place at all left for hatred. For no one except the greatest of fools
would hate good men. And there is no reason at all for hating the bad. For just as
weakness is a disease of the body, so wickedness is a disease of the mind. And if
this is so, since we think of people who are sick in body as deserving sympathy
rather than hatred, much more so do they deserve pity rather than blame who suffer
an evil more severe than any physical illness.

Then I said, 'Yes, I can see
there is a kind of happiness and misery which are inseparable from the very actions
of good and bad men. But I believe that there is both good and bad in the actual
fortune []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001126}of ordinary people. No wise man prefers being in exile,
being poor and disgraced to being rich, respected, and powerful, and to remaining at
home and flourishing in his own city. For this is the way that wisdom is more
clearly and obviously seen to be operating, when somehow or other the happiness of
their rulers is communicated to the people they come into contact with, especially
if prison and death and all the other sufferings the law imposes by way of
punishment are reserved for the wicked citizens for whom they were intended. Why
this is all turned upside down, why good men are oppressed by punishments reserved
for crime and bad men can snatch the rewards that belong to virtue surprises me very
much, and I would like to know from you the reason for this very unjust confusion. I
would be less surprised if I could believe that the confusion of things is due to
the fortuitous operations of chance. But my wonder is only increased by the
knowledge that the ruling power of the universe is God. Sometimes He is pleasant to
the good and unpleasant to the bad, and other times He grants the bad their wishes
and denies the good. But since He often varies between these two alternatives, what
grounds are there for distinguishing between God and the haphazards of
chance?'

'It is not
surprising,' she said, 'if ignorance of the principle of its
order makes people think a thing is unplanned and chaotic. But even if you
don't know the reason behind the great plan of the universe, there is no
need for you to doubt that a good power rules the world and that everything happens
aright.

'It is so,' I said.
'But since it is part of your task to unravel the causes of matters that
lie hidden and to unfold reasons veiled in darkness, and since I am very much
disturbed by this strange phenomenon, I do beg you to tell me your teaching on this
point.'

She paused and smiled a moment before
answering.

'You are urging me to the
greatest of all questions, a question that can never be exhausted. The subject is of
such a kind that when one doubt has been removed, countless others spring up in its
place, like the [Hydra](#appendix002.xhtml_g70){#chapter004.xhtml_p70}'s
heads. The only way to check them is with a really lively intellectual fire. The
usual subjects of inquiry concern the oneness of providence, the course of fate, the
haphazard nature of []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001135}the random events of chance, divine
knowledge and predestination, and the freedom of the will; you can see for yourself
how difficult they are.

'However, as a knowledge of
these things, too, is a part of your treatment, we will try to determine something,
in spite of the narrow limits in which we are imprisoned by time. And if the
enchantments of song delight you, you will have to postpone your pleasure a little
while I weave together the close-knit arguments in their proper
order.'

'Whatever you wish,'
I said.

Then, as if she were starting a fresh
argument, she spoke as follows.

'The generation of all things,
the whole progress of things subject to change and whatever moves in any way,
receive their causes, their due order and their form from the unchanging mind of
God. In the high citadel of its oneness, the mind of God has set up a plan for the
multitude of events. When this plan is thought of as in the purity of
God's understanding, it is called Providence, and when it is thought of
with reference to all things, whose motion and order it controls, it is called by
the name the ancients gave it, Fate. If anyone will examine their meaning, it will
soon be clear to him that these two aspects are different. Providence is the divine
reason itself. It is set at the head of all things and disposes all things. Fate, on
the other hand, is the planned order inherent in things subject to change through
the medium of which Providence binds everything in its own allotted place.
Providence includes all things at the same time, however diverse or infinite, while
Fate controls the motion of different individual things in different places and in
different times. So this unfolding of the plan in time when brought together as a
unified whole in the foresight of God's mind is Providence; and the same
unified whole when dissolved and unfolded in the course of time is Fate.

'They are different, but the
one depends on the other. The order of Fate is derived from the simplicity of
Providence. A craftsman anticipates in his mind the plan of the thing he is going to
make, and then sets in motion the execution of the work and carries out in time the
construction of what he has seen all at one moment []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001141}present to
his mind's eye. In the same way God in his Providence constructs a single
fixed plan of all that is to happen, while it is by means of Fate that all that He
has planned is realized in its many individual details in the course of time. So,
whether the work of Fate is done with the help of divine spirits of Providence, or
whether the chain of Fate is woven by the soul of the universe, or by the obedience
of all nature, by the celestial motions of the stars, or by the power of the angels,
by the various skills of other spirits, or by some of these, or by all of them, one
thing is certainly clear: the simple and unchanging plan of events is Providence,
and Fate is the ever-changing web, the disposition in and through time of all the
events which God has planned in His simplicity.

'Everything, therefore, which
comes under Fate, is also subject to Providence, to which Fate itself is subject,
but certain things which come under Providence are above the chain of Fate. These
are things which rise above the order of change ruled over by Fate in virtue of the
stability of their position close to the supreme Godhead. Imagine a set of revolving
concentric circles. The inmost one comes closest to the simplicity of the centre,
while forming itself a kind of centre for those set outside it to revolve round. The
circle furthest out rotates through a wider orbit and the greater its distance from
the indivisible centre point, the greater the space it spreads through. Anything
that joins itself to the middle circle is brought close to simplicity, and no longer
spreads out widely. In the same way whatever moves any distance from the primary
intelligence becomes enmeshed in ever stronger chains of Fate, and everything is the
freer from Fate the closer it seeks the centre of things. And if it cleaves to the
steadfast mind of God, it is free from movement and so escapes the necessity imposed
by Fate. The relationship between the ever-changing course of Fate and the stable
simplicity of Providence is like that between reasoning and understanding, between
that which is coming into being and that which is, between time and eternity, or
between the moving circle and the still point in the middle.

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001144}'The
course of Fate moves the sky and the stars, governs the relationship between the
elements and transforms them through reciprocal variations; it renews all things as
they come to birth and die away by like generations of offspring and seed. It holds
sway, too, over the acts and fortunes of men through the indissoluble chain of
causes; and since it takes its origins from unchanging Providence, it follows that
these causes, too, are unchanging. For the best way of controlling the universe is
if the simplicity immanent in the divine mind produces an unchanging order of causes
to govern by its own incommutability everything that is subject to change, and which
will otherwise fluctuate at random.

'It is because you men are in
no position to contemplate this order that everything seems confused and upset. But
it is no less true that everything has its own position which directs it towards the
good and so governs it. There is nothing that can happen because of evil or because
engineered by the wicked themselves, and they, as we have most amply demonstrated,
are deflected from their search for the good by mistake and error, while the order
which issues from the supreme good at the centre of the universe cannot deflect
anyone from his beginning.

'No doubt your objection will
be that it is impossible for there to be a more unjust confusion than when the
fortunes of good men and bad alike continually vary between adversity and
prosperity. And I shall ask you if men have such soundness of mind as to be
infallible in their judgement of who is good and who is bad. No, human judgements
clash in this matter, and some people think the same men deserve reward as others
think worthy of punishment.

'Supposing, however, we grant
that someone may be able to judge between good and bad, it will hardly enable him to
see the inner hidden temperament, to borrow a term from physics,
[^7^](#chapter004-fn.xhtml_con0001451){#chapter004.xhtml_con0001148}
of men's []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001149}minds. Indeed, your surprise is like
that of a man who does not know why in the case of healthy bodies sweet things agree
with some and bitter things with others, or why some sick people are helped by
gentle remedies, others by sharp ones. But it is no surprise to the doctor who knows
the difference between the manner and temper of health and of sickness. Now, we know
that in the case of the mind health means goodness and sickness means wickedness.
And that the protector of the good and scourge of the wicked is none other than God,
the mind's guide and physician. He looks out from the watch-tower of
Providence, sees what suits each person, and applies to him whatever He knows is
suitable. This, then, is the outstanding wonder of the order of fate; a knowing God
acts and ignorant men look on with wonder at his actions.

'Let us glance at a few facts
concerning God's profundity, such as human reason can grasp. In the case
of someone you consider a model and a great defender of justice, omniscient
Providence thinks otherwise. A member of my own household, the poet Lucan, has
reminded us in the first book of his *Pharsali*. how in the struggle between
Caesar and [Pompey](#appendix002.xhtml_g110){#chapter004.xhtml_p110} the winning cause
pleased the Gods, but the losing cause pleased Cato, although he was a model of
virtue.
[^8^](#chapter004-fn.xhtml_con0001454){#chapter004.xhtml_con0001151}
Whenever, therefore, you see something happen here different from your
expectation, due order is preserved by events, but there is confusion and error in
your thinking.

'But let us suppose that there
was someone of such moral goodness that in his case the judgement of man and God
coincided; he will still be weak in strength of mind. Should adversity befall him,
he will perhaps give up practising the innocence which could not ensure his good
fortune. And so a wise direction spares the man whom adversity might affect for the
worse, to avoid distressing someone []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001153}who is not fit for it.
Another man may be perfect in every virtue, holy and very close to God: Providence
judges that it would be outrageous for him to meet with any adversity to such an
extent that he is not even allowed to be upset by bodily illness. As was said by
someone more excellent than me:
[^9^](#chapter004-fn.xhtml_con0001458){#chapter004.xhtml_con0001154}

The body of the holy one was built by
heaven.

'Often it happens that supreme
power is given to good men so that the exuberance of wickedness may be checked.
Others receive a mixture of good and bad fortune according to their quality of mind.
Providence stings some people to avoid giving them happiness for too long, and
others she allows to be vexed by hard fortune to strengthen their virtues of mind by
the use and exercise of patience. Some people are excessively afraid of suffering
for which they actually have the endurance; others are full of scorn for suffering
they cannot in fact bear. Both kinds she brings to self discovery through hardship.
Some men at the price of a glorious death have won a fame that generations will
venerate; some indomitable in the face of punishment have given others an example
that evil cannot defeat virtue. There is no doubt that it is right that these things
happen, that they are planned and that they are suited to those to whom they
actually happen.

'The fact, too, that the
wicked have their ups and downs of fortune is due to the same causes. When they
suffer, no one is surprised, because everyone considers they deserve ill; and their
punishments both deter others from crime and correct those on whom they are
inflicted. And when they prosper, it is a powerful argument to good men about the
kind of judgement they should make of such happiness as they often see wait upon the
wicked. And here there is something else I believe to be planned. There is perhaps
someone of such a headstrong and impulsive nature that poverty could the more easily
provoke him to crime. His sickness is relieved by Providence with a dose of wealth
as a remedy. Another man may []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001158}see his conscience blotched with
the wickedness of his deeds and compare his desert with the fortune he enjoys.
Perhaps he will begin to fear the hardness of losing all the things whose enjoyment
is so pleasant, and therefore change his ways and abandon wickedness in the fear of
losing happiness. Others have been thrown headlong into well deserved disaster by
using their happiness unworthily: and some were granted the right to punish in order
that they might be a source of trial for the good and of punishment for the bad. For
just as there is no agreement between good men and bad men, so even the bad cannot
agree amongst themselves. It could scarcely be otherwise when with his own vices
tearing his conscience in shreds each one is at loggerheads with himself, and they
often do things which they later see should never have been done.

'And so sovereign Providence
has often produced a remarkable effect -- evil men making other evil men
good. For some, when they think they suffer injustice at the hands of the worst of
men, burn with hatred for evil men, and being eager to be different from those they
hate, have reformed and become virtuous. It is only the power of God to which evils
may also be good, when by their proper use He elicits some good result. For a
certain order embraces all things, and anything which departs from the order planned
and assigned to it, only falls back into order, albeit a different order, so as not
to allow anything to chance in the realm of Providence.

'But as the *Ilia*.
puts it,

> Tis hard for me to speak as
> though a God.
> [^10^](#chapter004-fn.xhtml_con0001461){#chapter004.xhtml_con0001162}

And it is not allowed to man to
comprehend in thought all the ways of the divine work or expound them in speech. Let
it be enough that we have seen that God, the author of all natures, orders all
things and directs them towards goodness. He is quick to hold all that He has
created in His own image, and by means of the chain of necessity presided over by
Fate banishes all evil from the bounds []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001164}of His commonwealth. Evil
is thought to abound on earth. But if you could see the plan of Providence, you
would not think there was evil anywhere. But I see that you have long been bowed
down by the weight of this question. You are worn out by the prolixity of the
reasoning and have been looking forward to the sweetness of song. So take a draught
that will refresh you and make you able to apply your thoughts more closely to
further matters.

'Do you now see what is the
consequence of all that we have said?'

'No, what is
it?'

'All fortune is certainly
good.'

'How can that
be?'

'Listen. All fortune whether
pleasant or adverse is meant either to reward or discipline the good or to punish or
correct the bad. We agree, therefore, on the justice or usefulness of fortune, and
so all fortune is good.'

[]{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001174}'Your
argument is very true, and if I were thinking of the Providence you taught me about
just now and of Fate, your opinion would be firmly founded. But let us please
include it among those opinions we some time ago called
inconceivable.'

'Why so?' she
asked.

'Because it is a common
expression, frequently used by some, that people have bad fortune.'

'Your wish, then, is that we
should draw closer to everyday language to avoid the appearance of having moved too
far from common usage?'

'Yes, please.'

'Well, you think of something
that is useful as being good, don't you?'

'Yes.'

'Now, such fortune as either
disciplines or corrects is useful, isn't it?'

'Yes.'

'And so good?'

'Yes.'

'Now this kind of fortune is
that of men who are either already on the path of virtue when they battle with
adversity, or who turn to the path of virtue after quitting evil.'

'It is so.'

'What about the pleasant
fortune, then, that is given to good men as a reward? People don't say
this is bad, do they?'

'No. They hold it to be
extremely good, as it is.'

'Then what about the last kind
of fortune, which is adverse and curbs the bad with due punishment; do people think
this is good?'

'No, they don't;
they consider it to be the most miserable thing that can be imagined.'

'Takecare that in following
popular opinions we haven't produced something really
inconceivable!'

'What do you
mean?'

'Well, the result of all that
we have agreed is that whatever the []{#chapter004.xhtml_con0001194}fortune of those who are in
possession of virtue (whether that possession is perfect, still growing or only
incipient), it is good, while the fortune of all those who rest in wickedness is
utterly bad.' 'This is true, even if no one would dare to admit
it.' 'So a wise man ought no more to take it ill when he clashes
with fortune than a brave man ought to be upset by the sound of battle. For both of
them their very distress is an opportunity, for the one to gain glory and the other
to strengthen his wisdom. This is why virtue gets its name, because it is firm in
strength and unconquered by adversity.
[^11^](#chapter004-fn.xhtml_con0001464){#chapter004.xhtml_con0001195}

'For you who are set on the
path of increasing virtue have not come so far only to abandon yourself to delights
or languish in pleasure. You are engaged in a bitter but spirited struggle against
fortune of every kind, to avoid falling victim to her when she is adverse or being
corrupted by her when she is favourable. Hold to the middle way with unshakeable
strength. Whatever falls short or goes beyond, despises happiness but receives no
reward for its toil. It is in your own hands what fortune you wish to shape for
yourself, for the only function of adversity apart from discipline and correction,
is punishment.

She stopped speaking and was about to
move on to deal with certain other topics when I broke in.

'Your exhortation is very
fitting and appropriate to one of your authority. But you said just now that the
question of Providence was bound up with many others, and I want to put it to the
test. I want to know whether you think there is such a thing as chance, and what it
is.'

'The promise I made is a debt
I owe you and I am ready to repay it,' she said, 'and to open
the way for you to regain your true home. But useful as it is to know about these
other matters, they are somewhat aside from our proposed path, and I am afraid you
may be so worn out by digressions that you will be unable to complete the
journey.'

'Don't worry about
that,' I rejoined. 'It will be as good as a rest to be able to
see the things which most delight me. At the same time, since your argument has
stood firm on every side and its trustworthiness has remained undoubted, there need
be no doubt about what comes next.'

'I will obey your
wish,' she said, and began at once as follows.

'If chance is defined as an
event produced by random motion without any causal nexus, I would say that there is
no such thing as chance, and that apart from signifying the subject matter of our
discussion it is a completely meaningless word. If God imposes order upon all
things, there is no opportunity for random events. It is a true maxim that nothing
comes out of nothing. None of the ancients denied it, although they used it as an
axiom of their natural philosophy []{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001213}with special reference to
material objects, not efficient causes. If something does happen for no cause, it
obviously arises out of nothing; but if this is impossible, it is impossible, too,
for there to be chance of the kind we have just defined.'

'Well, then,' I
asked, 'isn't there anything which can properly be called chance
or accidental? Isn't there something for which these words are
appropriate, even though ordinary people don't recognize
it?'

'My Aristotle's
definition in his *Physics,'*.
[^1^](#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001473){#chapter005.xhtml_con0001216}
she said, 'is succinct and close to the truth.'

'In what way?' I
asked.

'Whenever something is done
for some purpose, and for certain reasons something other than what was intended
happens, it is called chance. For example, if someone began to dig the ground in
order to cultivate a field and found a cache of buried gold. This is believed to
have happened fortuitously, but it does not happen as a result of nothing; it has
its own causes, the unforeseen and unexpected conjunction of which have clearly
effected the chance event. If the cultivator of the field had not been digging, and
if the depositor had not buried his money at that point, the gold would not have
been found. These, therefore, are the causes of the fortuitous harvest. It is the
result of the conjunction of opposite causes, and not of the intention of the doers.
Neither the man who buried the gold, nor the man who was tilling the field intended
the discovery of the money, but, as I said, it happens as a result of the
coincidence that the one began to dig where the other had buried. We may therefore
define chance as an unexpected event due to the conjunction of its causes with
action which is done for some purpose. The conjunction and coincidence of the causes
is effected by that order which proceeds by the inescapable nexus of causation,
descending from the fount of Providence and ordering all things in their own time
and place.

'I understand, and I agree it
is as you say. But is there room in this chain of close-knit causes for any freedom
of the will? Or does the chain of Fate bind even the impulses of the human
mind?'

'There is freedom,'
she said. 'For it would be impossible for any rational nature to exist
without it. Whatever by nature has the use of reason has the power of judgement to
decide each matter. It can distinguish by itself between what to avoid and what to
desire. But man pursues what he judges to be desirable and avoids that which he
thinks undesirable. So that those creatures who have an innate power of reason also
have the freedom to will or not to will, though I do not claim that this freedom is
equal in all. Celestial and divine beings possess clear sighted judgement,
uncorrupted will, and the power to effect their desires. Human souls are of
necessity more free when they continue in the contemplation of the mind of God and
less free when they descend to bodies, and less still when they are imprisoned in
earthly flesh and blood. They reach an extremity of enslavement when they give
themselves up to wickedness and lose possession of their proper reason. Once they
have turned their eyes []{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001224}away from the light of truth above to
things on a lower and dimmer level, they are soon darkened by the mists of
ignorance. Destructive passions torment them, and by yielding and giving in to them,
they only aid the slavery they have brought upon themselves and become in a manner
prisoners of their own freedom. Even so, this is visible to the eye of Providence as
it looks out at all things from eternity and arranges predestined rewards according
to each man's merit.

'Look,' I said,
'there is something even more difficult which I find perplexing and
confusing.'

'Tell me,' she said,
'though I can guess what is troubling you.'

'Well, the two seem clean
contrary and opposite, God's universal foreknowledge and freedom of the
will. If God foresees all things and cannot be mistaken in any way, what Providence
has foreseen []{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001231}as a future event must happen. So that if from
eternity Providence foreknows not only men's actions but also their
thoughts and desires, there will be no freedom of will. No action or desire will be
able to exist other than that which God's infallible Providence has
foreseen. For if they can be changed and made different from how they were foreseen,
there will be no sure foreknowledge of the future, only an uncertain opinion; and
this I do not think can be believed of God.

'I do not agree with the
argument by which some people believe they can cut this Gordian knot. They say that
it is not because Providence has foreseen something as a future event that it must
happen, but the other way round, that because something is to happen it cannot be
concealed from divine Providence. In this way the necessity is passed to the other
side. It is not necessary, they say, that what is foreseen must happen, but it is
necessary that what is destined to happen must be foreseen, as though the point at
issue was which is the cause; does foreknowledge of the future cause the necessity
of events, or necessity cause the foreknowledge? But what I am trying to show is
that, whatever the order of the causes, the coming to pass of things foreknown is
necessary even if the foreknowledge of future events does not seem to impose the
necessity on them.

'If a man is sitting, it is
necessary that the opinion which concludes that he is sitting is true; and on the
other hand, if the opinion about the man is true, because he is sitting, it is
necessary that he is sitting. There is necessity, therefore, in both statements; in
the one that the man is sitting, and in the other that the opinion is true. But it
is not because the opinion is true, that the man sits; rather, the opinion is true
because it is preceded by the man's act of sitting. So although the cause
of the truth proceeds from the one side, there is, nevertheless, a common necessity
in either side. Clearly the same reasoning applies to Providence and future events.
For even if it is the case that they are foreseen because they are going to happen
and not that they happen because they are foreseen, it is nonetheless necessary that
[]{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001234}either future events be foreseen by God or that things
foreseen happen as foreseen, and this alone is enough to remove freedom of the
will.

'But how absurd it is to say
that the occurrence of temporal events is the cause of eternal prescience! Yet the
opinion that God foresees the future because it is destined to happen is the same as
believing that events of a single occurrence are the cause of that supreme
Providence.

'Moreover, just as when I know
something is, it is necessary that it be, so when I know that something is to be, it
is necessary that it shall be. It comes about, therefore, that the occurrence of the
event foreknown cannot be avoided.

'Finally, if anyone thinks
something is different from what it is, not only is it not knowledge, but it is a
false opinion very far from the truth of knowledge. So, if something is destined to
happen in such a way that its occurrence is not certain and necessary, who could
foreknow that it is to happen? For just as knowledge is unalloyed by falseness, so
that which is comprehended by knowledge cannot be other than as it is comprehended.
Indeed, the reason why there is no deception in knowledge is because it is necessary
for things to be exactly as knowledge understands them to be.

'The question is, therefore,
how can God foreknow that these things will happen, if they are uncertain? If He
thinks that they will inevitably happen while the possibility of their
non-occurrence exists, He is deceived, and this is something wicked both to think
and to say. But if His knowledge that they will happen as they do is of such a kind
that He knows they may as equally not happen as happen, what sort of knowledge is
this, which comprehends nothing sure or stable? How does it differ from that
ridiculous prophecy of [Tiresias](#appendix002.xhtml_g134){#chapter005.xhtml_p134} in
Horace's *Satire*.
[^3^](#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001479){#chapter005.xhtml_con0001239}

> Whatever I say either will be or
> won't?

[]{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001242}And how is divine
Providence superior to opinion if like men it considers those things uncertain whose
occurrence is uncertain? If there can be no uncertainty at that most sure fount of
all things, the coming to pass of those things which God firmly foreknows as future
events is certain. Therefore, human thoughts and actions have no freedom, because
the divine mind in foreseeing all things without being led astray by falseness binds
human thoughts and actions to a single manner of occurrence.

'Once this has been admitted,
the extent of the disruption of human affairs is obvious. In vain is reward offered
to the good and punishment to the bad, because they have not been deserved by any
free and willed movement of the mind. That which is now judged most equitable, the
punishment of the wicked and there ward of the good, will be seen to be the most
unjust of all; for men are driven to good or evil not by their own will but by the
fixed necessity of what is to be. Neither vice nor virtue will have had any
existence; but all merit will have been mixed up and undifferentiated. Nothing more
wicked can be conceived than this, for as the whole order of things is derived from
Providence and there is no room for human thoughts, it follows that our wickedness,
too, is derived from the Author of all good.

'It is pointless, therefore,
to hope for anything or pray to escape anything. What can a man hope for, or pray to
escape, when an inflexible bond binds all that can be wished for?

'And so the one and only means
of communication between man and God is removed, that is hope and prayer --
if indeed we do obtain for the price of due humility the inestimable return of
divine grace. And this is the only way by which it seems men can talk with God and
join themselves to that inaccessible light before they obtain it, by means of
supplication. And if admitting the necessity of future events means believing that
hope and prayer have no power, what way will there be left by which we can be joined
and united to that supreme Lord of the world? Cut off and separated from its source,
the human race, as you were singing just now, will be destined to grow weak and
exhausted.

##### IV {#chapter005.xhtml_con0001248 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

Then Philosophy spoke. 'This is
an old complaint about Providence. Cicero attacked it vigorously in his treatise.
*On Divinatio*.,
[^4^](#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001482){#chapter005.xhtml_con0001250}
and you yourself have investigated it at great length. But up to now none of
you has explained it with sufficient care and rigour. The reason for this blindness
is that the operation of human reasoning cannot approach the immediacy of divine
foreknowledge. If this immediacy could be understood by some means, all uncertainty
would be removed. Later on I will try to explain it and make it clear, once I have
first dealt with the matters that are disturbing you.

'Take the case of those who
believe that foreknowledge does not impose necessity upon the future, and that
freedom of the will is not infringed by foreknowledge. I would like to know why you
consider their reasoning ineffective. For the only source of your proof of the
predestination of the future is your belief that what is foreknown cannot but
happen. Therefore, if -- as you were only just now saying --if
foreknowledge does not impose any predestination on the future, why is it that acts
of the will are forced to be predestined?

'But for the sake of argument,
so that you may see what follows, let us say that there is no foreknowledge. In this
case, actions of the will are not forced to be predestined, are they?'

'No.'

'Again, let us say that there
is foreknowledge, but that it does not impose any predestination on things; the same
freedom of the will remains, I think, absolute and uninfringed.

'But, you will say, even if it
is not the same as predestination of the future, foreknowledge is a sign that the
future will inevitably happen. In this case, even if there were no foreknowledge,
everyone would agree that the occurrence of the future is predestined, since signs
represent what they denote but don't cause it.

[]{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001257}'So the
first thing to do is to show that nothing happens other than of necessity, so that
foreknowledge may be seen as a sign of this necessity; otherwise, if there is no
necessity, that foreknowledge, too, cannot be a sign of something that does not
exist. But we all agree that we cannot deduce a proof firmly founded upon reason
from signs or arguments imported from without: it must come from arguments that fit
together and lead from one to the next.

'It cannot be that what is
foreseen as a future event does not come to pass. It would be as if we believed that
what Providence foreknows as future events is not going to happen, instead of
believing that although they happen, they were not predestined in their own nature.
You will easily be able to see it in this way; we see many things before our eyes as
they happen, like the actions we see charioteers performing in order to control and
drive their chariots, and other things of this sort. But no necessity forces any of
them to happen in this way, does it?'

'No, for if they all happened
of necessity the exercise of skill would be futile.'

'Therefore, all those things
which happen without happening of necessity are, before they happen, future events
about to happen, but not about to happen of necessity. For just as the knowledge of
present things imposes no necessity on what is happening, so foreknowledge imposes
no necessity on what is going to happen.

'But this, you will say, is
the very point in question -- whether there can be any foreknowledge of
things whose occurrence is not inevitable. There seems to be a contradiction here,
and you think that the necessity of events is consequent upon their being foreseen,
while if there is no necessity, they cannot be foreknown, because you believe that
nothing can be comprehended by knowledge unless it is certain. If events of
uncertain occurrence are foreseen as if they were certain, it is only clouded
opinion, not the truth of knowledge; for you believe that to have opinions about
something which differ from the actual facts is not the same as the fulness of
knowledge.

'The cause of this mistake is
that people think that the totality of their knowledge depends on the nature and
capacity to be known []{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001263}of the objects of knowledge. But this is
all wrong. Everything that is known is comprehended not according to its own nature,
but according to the ability to know of those who do the knowing. Let us make it
clear with a brief example; the same roundness of shape is recognized in one way by
the sight and in another way by the touch. The sight remains at a distance and sees
the whole simultaneously by means of rays of light passing from the eye, while the
touch coming close to and grasping the sphere perceives its roundness part by part.
Similarly man himself is beheld in different ways by sense-perception, imagination,
reason and intelligence.
[^5^](#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001485){#chapter005.xhtml_con0001264}
The senses examine his shape as constituted in matter, while imagination
considers his shape alone without matter. Reason transcends imagination, too, and
with a universal consideration reflects upon the species inherent in individual
instances. But there exists the more exalted eye of intelligence which passes beyond
the sphere of the universe to behold the simple form itself with the pure vision of
the mind.
[^6^](#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001487){#chapter005.xhtml_con0001265}

[]{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001267}'The point
of greatest importance here is this: the superior manner of knowledge includes the
inferior, but it is quite impossible for the inferior to rise to the superior. The
senses cannot perceive anything beyond matter; imagination does not consider
universal species; and reason does not comprehend simple form; but intelligence as
though looking down from above, first perceives form and then distinguishes all
things that are under it, but in such a way that it comprehends the form itself
which could not be known to any other. It knows reason's knowledge of
universals, imagination's knowledge of shape, and the senses'
knowledge of matter without using reason, imagination, or the senses, but by the
single glance of the mind according to the form, so to speak, as it looks out at all
things. Reason, too, []{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001268}when it looks at some universal, without
using imagination or the senses, comprehends the imaginable and sensible objects of
both. Reason it is that so defines the universal concept; man is a biped rational
animal. Since this is a universal concept, everyone knows it is a concept which can
be both imagined and perceived by the senses, while reason considers it not through
imagination or the senses, but through rational comprehension. Imagination, too, may
have taken its original power to see and form figures from the senses, yet in the
absence of the senses it can still survey all sensible objects not through sensory
but through imaginative perception.

'So you see, in their manner
of knowing they all use their own capacity to know rather than the capacity to be
known of the objects of their knowledge. And this is quite proper. For since every
judgement is an action of the one who judges, it is necessary that each should
perform its work by its own power and not another's.

##### V {#chapter005.xhtml_con0001280 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

'But if in the perception of
corporeal phenomena external stimuli strike and impinge on the instruments of the
senses, and corporeal passivity precedes mental activity -- a passivity
which stimulates mental activity and calls up the dormant forms in the mind
-- if, I say, in perceiving corporeal phenomena the mind is not passively
affected, but judges of its own power the experience subjected to the body, consider
the case of beings which in their mode of perception are free from all corporeal
influence. They can rouse their mind to activity without having to react to external
stimuli in order to perceive things. By this argument, therefore, a multiplicity of
kinds of knowledge has been given to different substances. Mere sensation without
any other kind of knowing has been given to animals that have no power of movement,
like mussels and other shellfish which grow on rocks. Imagination has been given to
animals which do have the power of movement and which appear to have some will to
choose or avoid things. Reason belongs only to the human race, just as intelligence
belongs only to divinity. The result is that that kind of knowing transcends the
others which of its own nature knows not only its own objects, but also the objects
of the other kinds of knowing.

'Suppose, then, the senses and
the imagination opposed reason and said that the universal that reason thought she
could see was nothing at all, on the grounds that what is sensible or imaginable
cannot be universal; and that either therefore the judgement of reason was true, and
that there was nothing sensible, or, since reason knew that many things were objects
of the senses and the imagination, reason's manner of knowing was
worthless, because it thought of that which was sensible and individual as a kind of
universal. If, moreover, reason should reply in answer that in considering what was
universal she kept in sight that which was comprehended by the senses and that which
was comprehended by the imagination, but []{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001283}that the senses and the
imagination could not rise to the recognition of universality because their manner
of knowing could not go beyond corporeal shapes: and if she added that in the matter
of the way things are known, credence should be given to the more sure and perfect
discernment; in an argument like this, we, being persons who have the ability to
reason as well as to imagine and perceive by the senses, would surely approve of the
case of reason.

'In the same way, human reason
refuses to believe that divine intelligence can see the future in any other way
except that in which human reason has knowledge. This is how the argument runs: if
anything does not seem to have any certain and predestined occurrence, it cannot be
foreknown as a future event. Of such, therefore, there is no foreknowledge: and if
we believe that even in this case there is foreknowledge, there will be nothing
which does not happen of necessity. If, therefore, as beings who have a share of
reason, we can judge of the mind of God, we should consider it most fitting for
human reason to bow before divine wisdom, just as we judged it right for the senses
and the imagination to yield to reason.

'Let us, then, if we can,
raise ourselves up to the heights of that supreme intelligence. There reason will be
able to see that which it cannot see by itself -- it will be able to see
how that which has no certain occurrence may be seen by a certain and fixed
foreknowledge, a knowledge that is not opinion, but the boundless immediacy of the
highest form of knowing.

##### VI {#chapter005.xhtml_con0001289 .EB07SmallCapsMediumHead}

'Since, therefore, as we have
just shown, every object of knowledge is known not as a result of its own nature,
but of the nature of those who comprehend it, let us now examine, as far as we may,
the nature of the divine substance, so that we may also learn what is its mode of
knowledge.

'It is the common judgement,
then, of all creatures that live by reason that God is eternal. So let us consider
the nature of eternity, for this will make clear to us both the nature of God and
his manner of knowing.
[^9^](#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001496){#chapter005.xhtml_con0001292}
Eternity, then, is the complete, simultaneous and perfect possession of
everlasting life; this will be clear from a comparison with creatures that exist in
time. Whatever lives in time exists in the present and progresses from the past to
the future, and there is nothing set in time which can embrace simultaneously the
whole extent of its life: it is in the position of not yet possessing tomorrow when
it has already lost yesterday. In this life of today you do not []{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001293}live more fully than in that fleeting and transitory moment. Whatever, therefore,
suffers the condition of being in time, even though it never had any beginning,
never has any ending and its life extends into the infinity of time, as Aristotle
thought was the case of the world, it is still not such that it may properly be
considered eternal.

'Its life may be infinitely
long, but it does not embrace and comprehend its whole extent simultaneously. It
still lacks the future, while already having lost the past. So that that which
embraces and possesses simultaneously the whole fullness of everlasting life, which
lacks nothing of the future and has lost nothing of the past, that is what may
properly be said to be eternal. Of necessity it will always be present to itself,
controlling itself, and have present the infinity of fleeting time.

'Those philosophers are wrong,
therefore, who when told that Plato believed the world had had no beginning in time
and would have no end, maintain that the created world is co-eternal with the
Creator. For it is one thing to progress like the world in Plato's theory
through everlasting life, and another thing to have embraced the whole of
everlasting life in one simultaneous present. This is clearly a property of the mind
of God. God ought not to be considered as older than the created world in extent of
time, but rather in the property of the immediacy of His nature. The infinite
changing of things in time is an attempt to imitate this state of the presence of
unchanging life, but since it cannot portray or equal that state it falls from
sameness into change, from the immediacy of presence into the infinite extent of
past and future. It cannot possess simultaneously the whole fullness of its life,
but by the very fact that it is impossible for its existence ever to come to an end,
it does seem in some measure to emulate that which it cannot fulfil or express. It
does this by attaching itself to some sort of presence in this small and fleeting
moment, and since this presence bears a certain resemblance to that abiding present,
it confers on whatever possesses it the appearance of being that which it
imitates.

'But since it could not
remain, it seized upon the infinite journey []{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001297}through time, and in
this way it became possible for it to continue by progression forward that life
whose fullness it could not embrace by remaining still. And so, if we want to give
things their proper names, let us follow Plato and say that God is eternal, the
world perpetual.

'Since, therefore, all
judgement comprehends those things that are subject to it according to its own
nature, and since the state of God is ever that of eternal presence, His knowledge,
too, transcends all temporal change and abides in the immediacy of His presence. It
embraces all the infinite recesses of past and future and views them in the
immediacy of its knowing as though they are happening in the present. If you wish to
consider, then, the foreknowledge or prevision by which He discovers all things, it
will be more correct to think of it not as a kind of foreknowledge of the future,
but as the knowledge of a never ending presence. So that it is better called
providence or ''looking forth'' than
prevision or ''seeing beforehand''. For it
is far removed from matters below and looks forth at all things as though from a
lofty peak above them.

'Why, then, do you insist that
all that is scanned by the sight of God becomes necessary? Men see things but this
certainly doesn't make them necessary. And your seeing them
doesn't impose any necessity on the things you see present, does
it?'

'No.'

'And if human and divine
present may be compared, just as you see certain things in this your present time,
so God sees all things in His eternal present. So that this divine foreknowledge
does not change the nature and property of things; it simply sees things present to
it exactly as they will happen at some time as future events. It makes no confused
judgements of things, but with one glance of its mind distinguishes all that is to
come to pass whether it is necessitated or not. Similarly you, when you see at the
same time a man walking on the earth and the sun rising in the sky, although the two
sights coincide yet you distinguish between them and judge the one to be willed and
the other necessitated. In the same way the divine gaze []{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001302}looks
down on all things without disturbing their nature; to Him they are present things,
but under the condition of time they are future things. And so it comes about that
when God knows that something is going to occur and knows that no necessity to be is
imposed upon it, it is not opinion, but rather knowledge founded upon truth.

'If you say at this point that
what God sees as a future event cannot but happen, and what cannot but happen,
happens of necessity, and if you bind me to this word necessity, I shall have to
admit that it is a matter of the firmest truth, but one which scarcely anyone except
a student of divinity has been able to fathom. I shall answer that the same future
event is necessary when considered with reference to divine foreknowledge, and yet
seems to be completely free and unrestricted when considered in itself. For there
are two kinds of necessity;
[^10^](#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001500){#chapter005.xhtml_con0001304}
one simple, as for example the fact that it is necessary that all men are
mortal; and one conditional, as for example, if you know someone is walking, it is
necessary that he is walking. For that which a man knows cannot be other than as it
is known; but this conditional necessity does not imply simple necessity, because it
does not exist in virtue of its own nature, but in virtue of a condition which is
added. No necessity forces the man to walk who is making his way of his own free
will, although it is necessary that he walks when he takes a step.

'In the same way, if
Providence sees something as present, it is necessary for it to happen, even though
it has no necessity in its own nature. God sees those future events which happen of
free will as []{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001306}present events; so that these things when
considered with reference to God's sight of them do happen necessarily as
a result of the condition of divine knowledge; but when considered in themselves
they do not lose the absolute freedom of their nature. All things, therefore, whose
future occurrence is known to God do without doubt happen, but some of them are the
result of free will. In spite of the fact that they do happen, their existence does
not deprive them of their true nature, in virtue of which the possibility of their
non-occurrence existed before they happened.

'What does it matter, then, if
they are not necessary, when because of the condition of divine foreknowledge it
will turn out exactly as if they were necessary? The answer is this. It is
impossible for the two events I mentioned just now -- the rising of the sun
and the man walking -- not to be happening when they do happen; and yet it
was necessary for one of them to happen before it did happen, but not so for the
other. And so, those things which are present to God will without doubt happen; but
some of them result from the necessity of things, and some of them from the power of
those who do them. We are not wrong, therefore, to say that if these things are
considered with reference to divine foreknowledge, they are necessary, but if they
are considered by themselves, they are free of the bonds of necessity; just as
everything that the senses perceive is universal if considered with reference to the
reason, but individual if considered in itself.

'But, you will reply, if it
lies in my power to change a proposed course of action, I will be able to evade
Providence, for I will perhaps have altered things which Providence foreknows. My
answer will be that you can alter your plan, but that since this is possible, and
since whether you do so or in what way you change it is visible to Providence the
ever present and true, you cannot escape divine foreknowledge, just as you cannot
escape the sight of an eye that is present to watch, though of your own free will
you may turn to a variety of actions.

'Well, you will ask,
isn't divine knowledge changed as a result of []{#chapter005.xhtml_con0001310}my
rearrangement, so that as I change my wishes it, too, seems to change its knowledge?
The answer is no. Each future thing is anticipated by the gaze of God which bends it
back and recalls it to the presence of its own manner of knowledge; it does not
change, as you think, with alternate knowledge of now this and now that, but with
one glance anticipates and embraces your changes in its constancy. God receives this
present mode of knowledge and vision of all things not from the issue of future
things but from His own immediacy. So that the difficulty you put forward a short
time ago,
[^11^](#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001503){#chapter005.xhtml_con0001311}
that it was unfitting if our future is said to provide a cause of
God's knowledge, is solved. The power of this knowledge which embraces all
things in present understanding has itself established the mode of being for all
things and owes nothing to anything secondary to itself. And since this is so,
man's freedom of will remains inviolate and the law does not impose reward
and punishment unfairly, because the will is free from all necessity. God has
foreknowledge and rests a spectator from on high of all things; and as the ever
present eternity of His vision dispenses reward to the good and punishment to the
bad, it adapts itself to the future quality of our actions. Hope is not placed in
God in vain and prayers are not made in vain, for if they are the right kind they
cannot but be efficacious. Avoid vice, therefore, and cultivate virtue; lift up your
mind to the right kind of hope, and put forth humble prayers on high. A great
necessity is laid upon you, if you will be honest with yourself, a great necessity
to be good, since you live in the sight of a judge who sees all things.'

## Glossary {#appendix002.xhtml_con0001586 .EB04MainHead}

*of Proper Names mentioned in the [Introduction](#preface001.xhtml_p1){#appendix002.xhtml_g1}, Text and Note*.,

*[]{#appendix002.xhtml_g2_1}[Acacius](#preface001.xhtml_p2){#appendix002.xhtml_g2}*, Patriarch of Constantinople, [AD]{.small} 471--489. He was probably the author of the Emperor Zeno's *Henoticon*, a theological formula intended to bring about union between the orthodox and the [Monophysites](#appendix002.xhtml_g84){#appendix002.xhtml_p84}. The formula was not accepted in Rome and led to a temporary schism (482-519) between East and West known as the Acacian schism.

*Achelous*, name of a river in [Greece](#preface001.xhtml_p3){#appendix002.xhtml_g3} and of its god; see note [p. 115](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001202){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001590}.

*[Agrippina](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_p6){#appendix002.xhtml_g6}*, known as Agnppma Minor; mother of the Emperor Nero whom she persuaded her third husband, the Emperor Claudius, to adopt. She was murdered on Nero's instructions in [AD]{.small} 59. See [Tacitus](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_se1), *Annals*, 12-14.

*[Albinus](#preface001.xhtml_p7){#appendix002.xhtml_g7}*, a Roman of consular rank accused by Cyprian of treason. His defence by Boethius led Cyprian to extend the charge to him as well.

*[Alcibiades](#chapter003.xhtml_p8){#appendix002.xhtml_g8}*, Athenian general (*c*., 450--404 [BC]{.small}). He was a pupil and friend of Socrates, and famous for his brilliant but disastrous career and for his physical beauty. See note [p. 61](#chapter003.xhtml_con0000769){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001597}.

*[Ammonius](#chapter005-fn.xhtml_p9){#appendix002.xhtml_g9}*, mystical philosopher (third century [AD]{.small}). Through his influence on his pupil Plotmus he is regarded as one of the founders of Neoplatomsm.

*[Anastasius](#preface001.xhtml_p10){#appendix002.xhtml_g10}*, Emperor of the East, [AD]{.small} 491--518.

*[Anaxagoras of Clazomenae](#chapter001.xhtml_p11){#appendix002.xhtml_g11}*, one of the earliest philosophers to settle in Athens (*c*. 500--*c*. 428 [BC]{.small}). He was brought to trial on charges of impiety and treachery but escaped with the aid of friends.

*[Anaxarchus of Abdera](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_p12){#appendix002.xhtml_g12}*, sceptic philosopher (fourth century [BC]{.small}). He was cruelly put to death by Nicocreon of Cyprus. See note [p. 38](#chapter002.xhtml_con0000634){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001602}.

*[Antaeus](#chapter004.xhtml_p13){#appendix002.xhtml_g13}*, a mythological giant who forced everyone he met to wrestle with him, and then killed them. Eventually he was himself defeated and killed by Hercules. See note [p. 115](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001202){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001604}.

*[Arcadian](#chapter004.xhtml_p14){#appendix002.xhtml_g14}*, God, see *[Hermes](#appendix002.xhtml_g65_2)*.

[]{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001607}*[Arianism](#preface001.xhtml_p15){#appendix002.xhtml_g15}*, a Christian heresy which taught the divinity of the Father but not of the Son. The Goths were Arians.

*[Aristotle](#aboutauthor.xhtml_p16){#appendix002.xhtml_g16}*, Greek philosopher (384--322 [BC]{.small}) and founder of the peripatetic school. See [Introduction](#preface001.xhtml_con0000091), pp. xvi-xvii.

*[Atreus](#chapter004.xhtml_p17){#appendix002.xhtml_g17}*, mythological father of Agamemnon.

*[Augustine](#preface.xhtml_p18){#appendix002.xhtml_g18}*, saint, philosopher, theologian, bishop of Hippo ([AD]{.small} 354--430). He was born and educated in North Africa, came to Rome in 383 and became professor of rhetoric at Milan in 384 where he came under the influence of St Ambrose and was baptized in 386. He was greatly influenced by Neoplatonism and through his writings (which include *The Confessions*, and *The City of God*), exercised the greatest influence on Christian thought of any of the Latin fathers.

*[Basilius](#chapter001.xhtml_p19){#appendix002.xhtml_g19}*, a Roman of doubtful reputation who was one of Boethius' accusers. He may be the same as the Basilius who was accused along with Praetextatus of magical practices (Cassiodorus, *Variae*, 4, 22 and 23), but the identification is uncertain.

*[Boethius](#aboutauthor.xhtml_p20){#appendix002.xhtml_g20}*, Anicius Manlius Severinus, Roman senator, philosopher and minister of Theodoric (*c*. 480--524 or 5 [AD]{.small}). See [Introduction](#preface001.xhtml_con5000091), pp. viii ff.

*[Britannicus](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_p21){#appendix002.xhtml_g21}*, Tiberius Claudius Caesar, son of the Emperor Claudius ([AD]{.small} 41-55). His stepmother Agrippina contrived that her own son Nero should succeed Claudius and according to general belief Britannicus was poisoned on Nero's orders. See note [p. 40](#chapter002.xhtml_con0000641){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001614}.

*[Brutus](#chapter002.xhtml_p22){#appendix002.xhtml_g22}*, Marcus Junius, the tyrannicide who took part in the murder of Julius Caesar 44 [BC]{.small}. Like Cato and Fabricius he was famous for his moral uprightness and virtue.

*[Burgundians](#preface001.xhtml_p23){#appendix002.xhtml_g23}*, a once powerful East Germanic people which had settled in the Rhône valley.

*[Busiris](#chapter002.xhtml_p24){#appendix002.xhtml_g24}*, a mythological king of Egypt reputed to sacrifice to Zeus all foreigners who entered Egypt. He was defeated and killed by Hercules.

*[Cacus](#chapter004.xhtml_p25){#appendix002.xhtml_g25}*, in mythology a savage fire-breathing monster who lived on the site of Rome and ravaged the neighbourhood. He was overcome and killed by Hercules when he stole the cattle of Geryon from him. See note [p. 115](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001202){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001619}, and Virgil *Aen*. 8, 190 ff.

*[Caesar](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_p26){#appendix002.xhtml_g26}*, Gaius Julius, Roman general and dictator murdered by Brutus and others (102--44 [BC]{.small}).

*[Caligula](#chapter001.xhtml_p27){#appendix002.xhtml_g27}*, nickname by which the Emperor Gaius [(AD]{.small} 12--41) was known. He was the most autocratic of the early emperors.

[]{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001623}*[Campania](#chapter001.xhtml_p28){#appendix002.xhtml_g28}*, a province of Italy extending from Rome to Salerno; roughly the modern Campagna.

*[Canius](#chapter001.xhtml_p29){#appendix002.xhtml_g29}*, probably the Stoic philosopher Julius Canus condemned to death by Caligula and cited by Seneca as an example of philosophic tranquillity *(De Tranquilitate*, 14, 4 ff).

*[Caracalla](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_p30){#appendix002.xhtml_g30}*, usual name of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus ([AD]{.small} 188--217). He had his brother and many distinguished men of state put to death.

*[Carthaginians](#appendix002.xhtml_p31){#appendix002.xhtml_g31}*, inhabitants of the North African city of Carthage, one of the great rivals of Rome in the Republican period. The Punic wars of the third and second centuries [BC]{.small} saw Rome gradually supersede Carthage as the chief Mediterranean power.

*[Cassiodorus](#preface001.xhtml_p32){#appendix002.xhtml_g32}*, Flavius Magnus Aurelius, Roman statesman, historian, encyclopedist, theologian and monk (*c*. [AD]{.small} 480-- *c*.575). He served Theodoric and his successors in the highest offices of state in a position equivalent to that of Prime Minister, and his collected letters (the *Variae*), are a chief source for the history of the time. When Ravenna was captured for Justinian by Belisarius in 540 and Gothic rule in Italy came to an end, Cassiodorus retired to a monastery he founded near his native Squillace in Calabria, where he was able to realize his educational interests. The programme of manuscript copying he instituted preserved for the world the pagan classical authors whose work was in danger of perishing. He was the most important sixth-century writer after Boethius. See [Hodgkin](#preface001-fn.xhtml_sep1)'s edition of the *Letters*, and E. K. Rand, *Founders of the Middle Ages*, pp. 240 ff.

*[Cato Uticensis](#chapter002.xhtml_p33){#appendix002.xhtml_g33}*, Marcus Porcius, Roman aristocrat, politician and Stoic, famous for his stern traditional morality (95--46 [BC]{.small}). His character in Lucan is a personification of virtue.

*[Catullus](#preface001.xhtml_p34){#appendix002.xhtml_g34}*, Gaius Valerius, Roman poet, writer mainly of short lyric, erotic, abusive and epigrammatic poems (*c*84-- *c*.54 [BC]{.small}). See note [p. 54](#chapter003.xhtml_con0000713){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001630}.

*[Caucasus](#chapter002.xhtml_p35){#appendix002.xhtml_g35}*, a chain of mountains stretching from the Black Sea to the Caspian, regarded as the extremity of the world.

*[Centaurs](#chapter004.xhtml_p36){#appendix002.xhtml_g36}*, a race of mythical monsters half man and half horse. See note [p. 115](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001202){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001633}.

*[Cerberus](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_p37){#appendix002.xhtml_g37}*, mythological monstrous dog guarding the entrance to Hades. The usual representation showed him with three heads and a mane or tail of snakes.

*[]{#appendix002.xhtml_g38_1}[]{#appendix002.xhtml_g38_2}[Cicero](#aboutauthor.xhtml_p38){#appendix002.xhtml_g38}*, Marcus Tullius, Roman orator, philosopher and writer of letters []{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001636}(106--43 [BC]{.small}). Boethius is greatly indebted to Cicero, quoting from philosophical works of his like the *Dream of Scipio*, and the lost *Hortensius*:, it was this latter work which first fired St Augustine's passionate interest in philosophy. Boethius was following Cicero's example in planning the translation of Greek philosophical works into Latin.

*[Circe](#chapter004.xhtml_p39){#appendix002.xhtml_g39}*, a mythological goddess encountered by Odysseus on his return journey from Troy. See note [p. 95](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001070){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001638}, and Homer *Odyssey*, 10, 210 ff.

*[Claudian](#preface001.xhtml_p40){#appendix002.xhtml_g40}*, (Claudius Claudianus), one of the last great Latin classic poets (d. *c*. [AD]{.small} 408).

*[Clovis](#preface001.xhtml_p41){#appendix002.xhtml_g41}*, (Chlodovechus), king of the Franks *(c*. [AD]{.small} 466--511). He was nominated consul by the Eastern Emperor Anastasius in 508.

*[Conigastor Cunigast](#chapter001.xhtml_p42){#appendix002.xhtml_g42}*, a Gothic minister of Theodoric and later of his grandson Athalaric, accused by Boethius of oppressing the poor.

*[Croesus](#chapter002.xhtml_p43){#appendix002.xhtml_g43}*, wealthy and powerful king of Lydia (reigned *c.* 560--546 [BC). H]{.small} is meeting with the Greek sage Solon was famous for the reply given by the latter to the question who was the happiest man he had ever seen. Solon said that no man should be considered happy until he had ended his life in a happy way. Croesus was eventually defeated and captured by Cyrus, and when about to be burnt alive called three times on the name of Solon. Cyrus inquired the identity of this Solon and on hearing the story, had Croesus released.

*[Cyclops](#chapter004.xhtml_p44){#appendix002.xhtml_g44}*, one of a mythological race of one-eyed giants, the most famous of whom was Polyphemus. See note [p. 114](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001197){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001644}.

*[Cyprian](#preface001.xhtml_p45){#appendix002.xhtml_g45}*, a Roman of noble birth, one of those who allied themselves to the Goths, accuser of Albinus and Boethius. At the time he was *referendarius*, in the king's court of appeal and a loyal and favourite servant of Theodoric. Boethius calls him an informer moved by hatred, but according to Cassiodorus Cyprian's impartiality was admired by litigants *(Variae* 5, 40) and he is praised in glowing terms. It was probably on a mission to the Byzantine court that he first unearthed the intrigues of the pro-Eastern circle in Rome. In 524 he was appointed Count of the Sacred Largesses and eventually promoted to the dignity of *patricius*.

*[Cyrus](#chapter002.xhtml_p46){#appendix002.xhtml_g46}*, founder of the Achaemenid Persian Empire and conqueror of Croesus of Lydia (reigned 559--529 [BC]{.small}). See [p. 25](#chapter002.xhtml_con0000551){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001647} and Herodotus 1, 71 ff.

*[Damocles](#chapter003.xhtml_p47){#appendix002.xhtml_g47}*, a courtier of Dionysius 1 of Syracuse. On one occasion when he spoke with exaggeration of the wealth and happiness of Dionysius, as a symbol of the uncertainty of his position Dionysius gave a sumptuous []{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001649}feast for him at which he had to sit with a sword suspended over his head by a single hair. See [Cicero](#appendix002.xhtml_g38_1), *Tusc.* 5, 61.

*[Decoratus](#chapter003.xhtml_p48){#appendix002.xhtml_g48}*, a young noble Roman advocate, appointed *quaestor*, probably along with Boethius some time before 509, the year of his death. Boethius speaks of him with contempt, but both Ennodius and Cassiodorus praise him for his excellent qualities.

*Diomodes*, mythological king of the Bistones; the eighth labour of [Hercules](#preface001.xhtml_p49){#appendix002.xhtml_g49} was to capture his man-eating horses. See note [p. 115](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001202){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001652}.

*[Dionysius](#chapter003.xhtml_p50){#appendix002.xhtml_g50}* 1, tyrant of Syracuse *(c*. 430--367 [BC]{.small}).

*Empedodes*, Sicilian philosopher of considerable importance in the development of [Greek philosophy](#preface001.xhtml_p51){#appendix002.xhtml_g51} *(c*. 493--433 [BC]{.small}). According to him cosmic history is a cyclic process of the combination and dissolution under the alternate influence of Love and Strife of the four eternally unchanging elements earth, air, fire and water.

*[Ennodius](#preface001.xhtml_p52){#appendix002.xhtml_g52}*, Magnus Felix, saint, Christian rhetorician, bishop of Pavia, writer of letters, speeches and poems ([AD]{.small} 473/4--521). He taught rhetoric at Milan until his ordination as bishop in *c*. 514. The chief characteristic of his writings is the turgidity of their style.

*Epicureanism*, see *[Epicurus](#appendix002.xhtml_p53)*.

*[]{#appendix002.xhtml_p53}[Epicurus](#chapter001-fn.xhtml_p54){#appendix002.xhtml_g54}*, famous Athenian philosopher (342/1--271/70 [BC]{.small}). He taught that the natural aim and highest good of man was pleasure or 'an independent and peaceful state of body and mind' and defined philosophy as the attempt to gain happiness by means of discussion and reasoning.

*[Erymanthian Boar](#chapter004.xhtml_p55){#appendix002.xhtml_g55}*, a savage animal that was supposed to have ranged Mount Erymanthus in Arcadia until killed by Hercules.

*[Evander](#chapter004.xhtml_p56){#appendix002.xhtml_g56}*, a mythological minor deity who settled on the site of Rome. Hercules visited him and killed the monster Cacus who had ravaged Evander's land. See note [p. 115](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001202){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001660} and Virgil, *Aen*, 8, 185 ff.

*[Euripides](#preface001.xhtml_p57){#appendix002.xhtml_g57}*, Greek tragedian (*c*. 485--*c*.406 [BC]{.small}).

*[Eurydice](#preface001.xhtml_p58){#appendix002.xhtml_g58}*, the wife of Orpheus.

*[Fabricius Luscinus](#preface001.xhtml_p59){#appendix002.xhtml_g59}*, Gaius, Roman general and politician (third century [BC]{.small}). He was a byword for the austerity and incorruptibility typical of ancient Roman virtue.

*[Franks](#preface001.xhtml_p60){#appendix002.xhtml_g60}*, the name assumed by a coalition of German tribes on the middle and lower Rhine who overran Gaul in the course of the fifth century. Under Clovis they destroyed the last vestiges of Roman power there and laid the foundations of the later kingdom of France.

*[Furies](#chapter003.xhtml_p61){#appendix002.xhtml_g61}*, mythological spirits of punishment.

[]{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001667}*[Gaudentius](#chapter001.xhtml_p62){#appendix002.xhtml_g62}*, a discredited informer, otherwise unknown, who laid information against Boethius.

*[Gundobad](#preface001.xhtml_p63){#appendix002.xhtml_g63}*, (Gundebadus), Arian king of the Burgundians *(c*. [AD]{.small} 480--516). His son married a daughter of Theodoric and his niece became the wife of Clovis.

*[Hercules](#chapter002.xhtml_p64){#appendix002.xhtml_g64}*, mythological Greek hero famous for his strength and courage. See note [pp. 114](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001197){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001670}--15.

*[]{#appendix002.xhtml_g65_2}[Hermes](#chapter004-fn.xhtml_p65){#appendix002.xhtml_g65}*, the Arcadian God who came to the aid of Odysseus in dealing with Circe. See note [p. 95](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001070){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001672}.

*[Hermus](#chapter003.xhtml_p66){#appendix002.xhtml_g66}*, an auriferous river in Turkey (modern Gediz).

*[Hesperides](#chapter004.xhtml_p67){#appendix002.xhtml_g67}*, the mythological guardians along with the dragon Ladon of the golden apples given to Hera at her marriage with Zeus and which Hercules was set to win as his eleventh labour.

*[Homer](#preface001.xhtml_p68){#appendix002.xhtml_g68}*, the Greek epic poet (sometime before 700 [BC]{.small}).

*[]{#appendix002.xhtml_g69_2}[Horace](#preface.xhtml_p69){#appendix002.xhtml_g69}*, (Quintus Horatius Flaccus), Roman poet (65--8 [BC]{.small}).

*[Hydra](#chapter004.xhtml_p70){#appendix002.xhtml_g70}*, the water-serpent killed by Hercules at Lerna in Argolis; it had nine heads, and as fast as one of them was cut off, two more sprang up in its place.

*[Iamblichus](#chapter005-fn.xhtml_p71){#appendix002.xhtml_g71}*, Neoplatonist philosopher *(c*. [AD]{.small} 250--*c*. 325). He was born in Coele Syria, studied under Porphyry in Rome or Sicily, wrote on [Pythagoras](#appendix002.xhtml_g115){#appendix002.xhtml_p115} and composed an anthology of earlier writers. He was credited with important contributions to the development of the philosophy of Plotinus, but in fact his works are superficial and substitute theosophy and magic for the mysticism of Plotinus.

*[Indus](#chapter003.xhtml_p72){#appendix002.xhtml_g72}*, a river flowing into the Arabian Sea through what is now modern Pakistan.

*[Ithaca](#chapter004.xhtml_p73){#appendix002.xhtml_g73}*, one of the Ionian Islands off the west coast of Greece, the home of Odysseus.

*[Ixion](#chapter003.xhtml_p74){#appendix002.xhtml_g74}*, according to Greek mythology he murdered his father-in-law. He was purified by Zeus but attempted to seduce the goddess Hera. As a punishment he was bound in Hades to an ever revolving wheel.

*[John I](#preface001.xhtml_p75){#appendix002.xhtml_g75}*, saint and pope in succession to St Hormisdas ([AD]{.small} 523). He was sent by Theodoric on a mission to the Emperor at Constantinople, but on the confirmation of Theodoric's suspicions of the pro-Eastern party at Rome, was thrown into prison where he died in 526.

*[Justinian](#preface001.xhtml_p76){#appendix002.xhtml_g76}*, (Flavius Petrus Sabbatius Iustinianus), Roman Emperor of the East ([AD]{.small} 527--65). Through his general Belisarius he invaded and occupied Italy in the period after Theodoric's death. His political ambition to []{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001684}reunite the Eastern and Western Empire was probably the inspiration of the pro-Eastern circle around Symmachus and Boethius.

*[Juvenal](#preface001.xhtml_p77){#appendix002.xhtml_g77}*, (Decimus Iunius Iuvenalis), greatest of the Roman satiric poets *(c*. [AD]{.small} 50--after 127).

*[Liberius](#preface001.xhtml_p78){#appendix002.xhtml_g78}*, a Roman minister of Odoacer and later of Theodoric, Praetorian Prefect 493--500. It is recorded that he was a wise and skilful administrator.

*[Lombards](#preface001.xhtml_p79){#appendix002.xhtml_g79}*, an East Germanic people who invaded Italy in [AD]{.small} 568 not long after Justinian had re-established the imperial rule there.

*[Lucan](#preface001.xhtml_p80){#appendix002.xhtml_g80}*, (Marcus Annaeus Lucanus), Roman poet, author of the *Pharsalia*, a poem in ten books about the civil war between Caesar and Pompey ([AD]{.small} 39--65).

*[Lynceus](#chapter003.xhtml_p81){#appendix002.xhtml_g81}*, a mythological Greek hero endowed with supernatural sharpness of sight.

*[Martianus Capella](#preface001.xhtml_p82){#appendix002.xhtml_g82}*, author of a long encyclopedic mixture of verse and prose called *The Marriage of Mercury and Philology* (early fifth century [AD]{.small}). The form of this work (Menippean satire) may have influenced Boethius but not its whimsical and pedantic subject matter or 'perversely mannered' style. The work of Martianus was widely appreciated in the Middle Ages.

*[Menander](#preface001.xhtml_p83){#appendix002.xhtml_g83}*, Greek comic playwright (342/1--291/90 [BC).]{.small}

*[Monophysites](#appendix002.xhtml_p84){#appendix002.xhtml_g84}*, a heretical sect which taught that in the Person of the incarnate Christ there was a single divine nature: the orthodox teaching is that there is a double nature in Christ, divine and human.

*[Muses](#chapter001.xhtml_p85){#appendix002.xhtml_g85}*, Greek goddesses of poetry, music and dance. The later addition of Muses of astronomy, philosophy and all intellectual pursuits provides Dame Philosophy with the muses she opposes to those she finds at Boethius's bedside in I, 1.

*[Nearchus](#chapter002.xhtml_p86){#appendix002.xhtml_g86}*, a Greek Tyrant: see [Zeno of Elea](#appendix002.xhtml_g145_1).

*[Nemea](#chapter004.xhtml_p87){#appendix002.xhtml_g87}*, a valley on the north borders of Argolis, the scene of Hercules' fight with the lion. See note [p. 115](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001202){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001696}.

*[Neoplatonism](#preface001.xhtml_p88){#appendix002.xhtml_g88}*, the revival of Platonism which reached its peak in the third century [AD]{.small}. It was really a new synthesis of elements from Platonism, Aristotelianism, Pythagoreanism and Stoicism. It survived until the closing of the pagan schools by Justinian in 529 and deeply influenced Christian thought in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The chief Neoplatonist philosophers were Plotinus and his pupil Porphyry.

*[Nero](#chapter003.xhtml_p89){#appendix002.xhtml_g89}*, (Nero Claudius Caesar), Roman Emperor ([AD]{.small} 37--68). He was reputed to have arranged the murder of his stepbrother Britannicus (who had a better claim to the throne) and of his mother Agrippina.

[]{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001700}*[Nicocreon](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_p90){#appendix002.xhtml_g90}*, a tyrant of Salamis in Cyprus (ruled 332/1--311/10 [BC]{.small}). The philosopher Anaxarchus of Abdera is said to have caused him mortal offence in the course of a drinking bout, and when he fell into the tyrant's hands in 323 he was pounded to death in a mortar.

*Nominalism*, the name given to the medieval school of philosophy which 'held that universals were merely words, that only individuals existed, and that the genus or the species corresponded to nothing in the real world' (G. Leff).

*[Nonius](#chapter003.xhtml_p92){#appendix002.xhtml_g92}*, unknown Roman politician satirized by Catullus. See note [p. 54](#chapter003.xhtml_con0000713){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001703}.

*[Odoacer](#preface001.xhtml_p93){#appendix002.xhtml_g93}*, a Hunnish king of Italy, murdered by Theodoric *(c*. [AD]{.small} 433--493).

*[Odysseus](#preface001.xhtml_p94){#appendix002.xhtml_g94}*, mythological king of Ithaca, and one of the leaders of the Greek expedition to Troy. He is the hero of the *Odyssey*, in which his adventures on the return voyage from Troy are recounted.

*[Opilio](#preface001-fn.xhtml_p95){#appendix002.xhtml_g95}*, younger brother of Cyprian. He fell from favour under Theodoric but regained his position by laying information against Boethius. Under Theodoric's grandson Athalaric he held high office as Count of the Sacred Largesses (527 [AD]{.small}) and ambassador with Liberius to Constantinople.

*[Orpheus](#preface001.xhtml_p96){#appendix002.xhtml_g96}*, famous mythological Greek musician reputed to be able to move trees and charm wild animals. He went down to Hades to recover his dead wife. See [p. 82](#chapter003.xhtml_con0000983){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001708}.

*[Ostrogoths](#preface001.xhtml_p97){#appendix002.xhtml_g97}*, the eastern group of the Germanic peoples called Goths, settled in the third century [AD]{.small} in the steppelands between the Crimea and the rivers Don and Dniester. The sudden irruption of the Asiatic Huns caused them to move and eventually settle in the Po valley in Italy. They were Arian Christians.

*[Ovid](#preface001.xhtml_p98){#appendix002.xhtml_g98}*, (Publius Ovidius Naso), Roman poet (43 [BC]{.small}-?[AD]{.small} 17).

*[Papinian](#chapter003.xhtml_p99){#appendix002.xhtml_g99}*, (Aemilius Papinianus), Roman jurist executed in [AD]{.small} 212 on the orders of the emperor Caracalla for disapproving of the murder of the Emperor's brother Geta.

*[Parmenides](#chapter003.xhtml_p100){#appendix002.xhtml_g100}*, Greek poet and philosopher at Athens (c. 450 [BC]{.small}).

*[Parthians](#chapter002.xhtml_p101){#appendix002.xhtml_g101}*, a semi-nomadic people between the Euphrates and the Indus, traditional enemies of Rome, famous for their horsemanship.

*[Paulinus](#chapter001.xhtml_p102){#appendix002.xhtml_g102}*, a Roman of consular rank defended by Boethius against the rapacity of the Goths. He is possibly the Paulinus who was consul in 493 and prosecuted by Symmachus and Festus *(Variae*, 1, 23); but Boethius would hardly have referred to Symmachus as a 'palace jackal.' Paulinus is spoken of with approval by Cassiodorus in another letter (2, 3).

*Paulus*,[]{#appendix002.xhtml_g103_2} ([Lucius](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_p103){#appendix002.xhtml_g103} Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus), Roman general and administrator[]{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001716}, consul 182 and 168 [BC]{.small}, conqueror of Macedonia. See [p. 25](#chapter002.xhtml_con0000551){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001717}.

*[Perses](#chapter002.xhtml_p104){#appendix002.xhtml_g104}*, (or *Perseus*), last king of Macedonia, 179--168 [BC]{.small}. He was defeated and captured by Aemilius Paulus and led in triumph through Rome. See [p. 26](#chapter002.xhtml_con0000553){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001719} and Livy XLV, 7 ff.

*[Phoebus](#chapter002.xhtml_p105){#appendix002.xhtml_g105}*, the sun god. See note [p. 87](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001006){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001721}. Brother *of Phoebe*, or *Luna*, the moon goddess.

*[Pholoe](#chapter004.xhtml_p106){#appendix002.xhtml_g106}*, a mountain south east of Elis where Hercules was reputed to have visited the centaur Pholus. He was attacked by a band of centaurs whom he put to flight. See note [p. 115](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001202){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001723}. Pholus was accidentally killed and buried in the mountain which was named after him.

*[Plato](#preface001.xhtml_p107){#appendix002.xhtml_g107}*, the Athenian philosopher (*c*. 429--347 [BC]{.small}). He taught near the grove of Academus, whence the school he founded to train men for the service of the state was called the Academy: it survived to [AD]{.small} 529.

*[Plotinus](#preface001.xhtml_p108){#appendix002.xhtml_g108}*, Neoplatonist Greek philosopher ([AD]{.small} 205--269/70). He studied under Ammonius Saccas at Alexandria and taught at Rome. His philosophical essays, the *Enneads*, were collected and arranged by his pupil Porphyry. E. R. Dodds calls him 'the most powerful philosophical mind between Aristotle and Aquinas'.

*[Polyphemus](#chapter004.xhtml_p109){#appendix002.xhtml_g109}*, a Cyclops blinded by Odysseus. See note [p. 114](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001197){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001727} and Homer, *Od*., IX.

*[Pompey](#chapter004.xhtml_p110){#appendix002.xhtml_g110}*, (Gnaeus Pompeius), Roman general and politician, one time colleague and later enemy of Caesar (106--48 [BC]{.small}). His struggle with Caesar culminating in his defeat at Pharsalus and murder in Egypt is the subject *of Lucan's Pharsalia*.

*[Porphyry](#preface001.xhtml_p111){#appendix002.xhtml_g111}*, (Porphyrius), scholar, philosopher and student of religions ([AD]{.small} 232/3-- *c*. 305). He was the devoted personal disciple of Plotinus whose writings he edited. Among his many works (now partly lost) were numerous philosophical commentaries on Plato, Aristotle and others, including the famous *Isagoge*, or *Introduction to the Categories of Aristotle*, which became a standard medieval textbook of logic and was translated and commented on by Boethius. He was a remarkable polymath, but his work as a thinker was not important.

*[Proclus](#preface001.xhtml_p112){#appendix002.xhtml_g112}*, Neoplatonic Greek philosopher and head of the Academy ([AD]{.small} 412--485).

*[Pseudo-Dionysius](#preface001.xhtml_p113){#appendix002.xhtml_g113}*, the name given to an unknown mystical theologian of *c*. [AD]{.small} 500, who seems to have aimed at making a synthesis of Neoplatonist thought and Christian teaching. He writes of the mystical union of the soul with God achieved by the process of 'unknowing' in which the []{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001732}soul leaves behind the knowledge of the senses and the reason to be illuminated and deified by God. His writings exercised a profound influence on medieval religious experience.

*[Ptolemy](#chapter002.xhtml_p114){#appendix002.xhtml_g114}*, (Claudius Ptolemaeus) of Alexandria, Greek geographer *(fl*. [AD]{.small} 121--151). He wrote on trigonometry, astronomy, optics and geography; the last is an eight book treatise and atlas which despite its faults remained the standard geography until relatively recent times.

*[Pythagoras](#appendix002.xhtml_p115){#appendix002.xhtml_g115}*, early Greek astronomer, mathematician and religious leader (sixth century [BC]{.small}).

*[Ravenna](#preface001.xhtml_p116){#appendix002.xhtml_g116}*, a city on the Adriatic coast of Italy, capital of the Western Empire from the beginning of the fifth century.

*[Realists](#preface001.xhtml_p117){#appendix002.xhtml_g117}*, the name of the school of medieval philosophy which in contradistinction to the Nominalists 'recognized, in some degree, the existence of genera and species and their correspondence to reality' (G. Leff).

*[Regulus](#chapter002.xhtml_p118){#appendix002.xhtml_g118}*, Marcus Atilius, Roman general (third century [BC]{.small}). In 255 he was defeated and captured by the [Carthaginians](#appendix002.xhtml_g31){#appendix002.xhtml_p31}, and was later sent on parole to Rome to arrange an exchange of prisoners. The (probably apocryphal) story of his voluntary return to Carthage and death by torture became a famous episode in the annals of Roman history. See [Horace](#appendix002.xhtml_g69_2) *Odes*, 3, 5 and Cicero *De Officiis*, 3, 26, 99.

*[Rusticiana](#preface001.xhtml_p119){#appendix002.xhtml_g119}*, daughter of Symmachus and wife of Boethius.

*[Saturn](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_p120){#appendix002.xhtml_g120}*, the planet. See note [p. 87](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001006){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001740}.

*[Seneca](#preface001.xhtml_p121){#appendix002.xhtml_g121}*, Lucius Annaeus, distinguished and wealthy Roman orator, philosopher and tragedian, tutor and later adviser of the Emperor Nero *(c.* 5/4, [BC]{.small}-[AD]{.small} 65). When he was nearly seventy Seneca attempted to retire and give up his immense wealth to Nero, but the Emperor refused. Later he was implicated in a plot against Nero and forced to commit suicide.

*[Sidonius](#preface001.xhtml_p122){#appendix002.xhtml_g122}*, (Gaius Sollius Modestus Apollinaris), saint, statesman, author and bishop of Clermont. He was a Gallo-Roman born at Lyons of noble family about [AD]{.small} 430, and was Prefect of Rome 468--9. His appointment as bishop (while he was probably still a layman) was political, but he abandoned poetry, became a benefactor of monks and gave away his wealth. He was one of the last representatives of classical culture and his poetry was skilful if uninspired.

*[Socrates](#chapter001.xhtml_p123){#appendix002.xhtml_g123}*, the Greek philosopher (469--399 [BC]{.small}). He was arrested and tried on a charge of corrupting the young and being guilty of impiety. Thirty days elapsed between his condemnation and death by drinking hemlock, []{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001744}and his conversations during this period are preserved by Plato. See *The Last Days of Socrate*., translated by Hugh Tredennick. (Penguin Classics, 1954.)

*[Sophocles](#preface001.xhtml_p124){#appendix002.xhtml_g124}*, Greek tragedian (*c*. 496--406 [BC]{.small}).

*[Soranus](#chapter001.xhtml_p125){#appendix002.xhtml_g125}*, Marcus Barea, a prominent Roman of the time of Nero, who had been a just and energetic governor of Asia. He was forced to commit suicide by Nero (Tacitus, *Annals*, 16, 32).

*[Statius](#preface001.xhtml_p126){#appendix002.xhtml_g126}*, Publius Papinius, Roman poet ([AD]{.small} 45--96). He wrote occasional poems (the *Silvae*), and two epics (the *Thebais*, and *Achilleis*), the latter interrupted by his death. In his fluent and highly polished verse he imitated Virgil.

*[Stoicism](#preface001.xhtml_p127){#appendix002.xhtml_g127}*, a philosophical school founded by Zeno of Citium *c*. 300 [BC]{.small}. See note [p. 128](#chapter005.xhtml_con0001268){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001749}. Its ethical system and teaching concerning the virtuous life were very influential; Seneca was one of the chief stoics under the emperors, and Stoicism provided the philosophical basis for the opposition to imperial autocracy. The influence of Stoicism on later Neo-platonism and on some fathers of the Christian church was considerable.

*[Stymphalus](#chapter004.xhtml_p128){#appendix002.xhtml_g128}*, lake and district in North East Arcadia (modern Zaraka). Pausan-ias describes a temple of Artemis there near which stood some statues of young women with legs and thighs of birds. These are the legendary Stymphalian birds whose destruction was one of the labours of Hercules. See note [p. 115](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001202){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001751}.

*[Symmachus](#preface001.xhtml_p129){#appendix002.xhtml_g129}*, Quintus Aurelius Memmius, Roman consul ([AD]{.small} 485), patrician, and head of the Senate ([AD]{.small} 524). He is spoken of with affection and admiration by his son-in-law, Boethius, and praised by Ennodius and Cassiodorus. He combined the interests of philosopher and historian (writing a Roman history in seven books) and was an orator of considerable eloquence. He spent money on the repair of public buildings in Rome and impressed his contemporaries with his love of the Roman ideal. Cassiodorus calls him 'a modern imitator of the ancient Cato, but \[he\] surpassed the virtues of the men of old in \[his love of\] the most holy religion'; although he served Theodoric, his ancestry and upbringing led him to oppose him both as a heretic and a barbarian. He was executed in 525.

*[Tagus](#chapter003.xhtml_p130){#appendix002.xhtml_g130}*, one of the principal rivers of Spain (modern Tajo) celebrated for its fish, oysters and gold-bearing sand.

*[Tantalus](#chapter003.xhtml_p131){#appendix002.xhtml_g131}*, mythological king of Lydia whose crime - either the devouring of his own children or theft of food from the gods - was punished in []{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001755}Hades as follows. He was tormented by hunger and thirst, and tantalized by being placed in water up to his chin and with fruit hanging over his head; but whenever he moved to eat or drink the fruit and water receded. See[p. 83](#chapter003.xhtml_con0000988){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001756}.

*[Theodoric](#preface001.xhtml_p132){#appendix002.xhtml_g132}*, known as Theodoric the Great and remembered in saga as Dietrich von Bern (Verona). He was king of the Ostrogoths in succession to his father Theudemir who d. [AD]{.small} 474. Theodoric was born about 454 and sent at the age of seven as a hostage to Constantinople where he received his early upbringing and education. He led his people on various campaigns both for and against the Emperor (who at various stages adopted him and made him consul), and eventually set out for Italy with the blessing of Constantinople in 488. Ravenna surrendered in 493 and after the murder of Odoacer Theodoric became king of Italy. His rule brought peace and prosperity which was only broken by the resumption of the persecution of Arians in the east and the discovery of treason among the senators in Rome. He died with his policy in ruins in 526.

*[Thulé](#chapter003.xhtml_p133){#appendix002.xhtml_g133}*, an island in the Northern Ocean regarded as the most northerly point of the known world, variously identified as Mainland in the Shetland Islands or Iceland.

*[Tityus](#chapter003-fn.xhtml_p135){#appendix002.xhtml_g135}*, a mythological giant punished in Hades for assaulting a goddess. He lay stretched out on the ground covering nine acres while two vultures tore at his liver. See note [p. 84](#chapter003.xhtml_con0000990){#appendix002.xhtml_con0001761}.

*Triguila*, a Goth whose evil designs were frustrated by [Boethius](#preface.xhtml_p136){#appendix002.xhtml_g136}. Their nature is not specified and nothing more is known of him except that he was a palace official.

*[Troy](#chapter004-fn.xhtml_p137){#appendix002.xhtml_g137}*, a city in modern Turkey near the Aegean entrance to the Dardanelles (modern Hissarlik). It was the scene of the Trojan war in the *Iliad*.

*[Tynan Dyes](#chapter002.xhtml_p139){#appendix002.xhtml_g139}*, so called from Tyre, an important city on the coast of Phoenicia south of Sidon, famous as the seat of a purple-dyeing industry.

*[Verona](#preface001.xhtml_p140){#appendix002.xhtml_g140}*, an important city in Northern Italy near lake Garda, used as an occasional capital by Theodoric.

*[Zeno](#preface001.xhtml_p143){#appendix002.xhtml_g143}*, Roman Emperor of the East ([AD]{.small}*c*.450--91). His reign was largely []{#appendix002.xhtml_con0001770}a succession of disastrous wars against various enemies including the Ostrogoths. He was author of the *Henotikon*: see under *[Acacius](#appendix002.xhtml_g2_1)*.

*[Zeno of Citium](#chapter005-fn.xhtml_p144){#appendix002.xhtml_g144}*, Greek philosopher and founder of the Stoic school (335--263 [BC).]{.small}

*[]{#appendix002.xhtml_g145_1}[Zeno of Elea](#chapter002-fn.xhtml_p145){#appendix002.xhtml_g145}*, Greek philosopher, pupil and friend of Parmenides, b. *c*. 490 [BC]{.small} He was a member of the Eleatic school of philosophy and one of three philosophers of whom Diogenes Laertius tells the story that he bit out his own tongue to scorn the tyrant (in Zeno's case called Nearchus) who was torturing him into confession: he was afterwards pounded to death in a mortar.

## ***He just wanted a decent book to read ...*** {#marketing.xhtml_con0000055 .BodyTextCenterLineSpace1}

Not too much to ask, is it? It was in 1935 when Allen Lane, Managing Director of Bodley Head Publishers, stood on a platform at Exeter railway station looking for something good to read on his journey back to London. His choice was limited to popular magazines and poor-quality paperbacks -- the same choice faced every day by the vast majority of readers, few of whom could afford hardbacks. Lane's disappointment and subsequent anger at the range of books generally available led him to found a company -- and change the world.

*We believed in the existence in this country of a vast reading public for intelligent books at a low price, and staked everything on it'\
**Sir Allen Lane, 1902--1970, founder of Penguin Books***

The quality paperback had arrived -- and not just in bookshops. Lane was adamant that his Penguins should appear in chain stores and tobacconists, and should cost no more than a packet of cigarettes.

Reading habits (and cigarette prices) have changed since 1935, but Penguin still believes in publishing the best books for everybody to enjoy.We still believe that good design costs no more than bad design, and we still believe that quality books published passionately and responsibly make the world a better place.

So wherever you see the little bird -- whether it's on a piece of prize-winning literary fiction or a celebrity autobiography, political tour de force or historical masterpiece, a serial-killer thriller, reference book, world classic or a piece of pure escapism -- you can bet that it represents the very best that the genre has to offer.

### **Whatever you like to read -- trust Penguin.** {#marketing.xhtml_con0000061 .BodyTextCenterLineSpace}

This valuable and important comment receives support from a number of passages where we perhaps get a glimpse of the unseen realm of the soul'. We have already noticed an echo of the Our Father (p. xxviii), and on p. **67**the possible influence of the Christian hymns is discussed. There is the passage mentioned above (p. xxxiii) in which the parallel discipline of faith is implied, and there is the possible reference to Hell and Purgatory the existence of which Philosophy says she does not wish to discuss at that point (IV, 4). There are apparently some twenty-five places where without actually referring to the Bible, Boethius appears to echo Scriptural passages, cf. the *Index locorum Sacrae Scriptura*. in Bieler's edition. In Book III, poem **12**, if the commentators are right, Boethius tells Philosophy of the delight it causes him to hear her quoting the words of scripture: see note p. 81. Cf. also F. P. Pickering, *Notes on Fate and Fortune, in Mediaeval German Studies Presented to Frederick Norman*. London, 1965, pp. 1 --15.

[**8**](#chapter003.xhtml_con0000770){#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001409}. This passage must be understood in terms of the Ptolemaic explanation of the universe which was generally accepted from the second century [AD]{.small} until the time of Copernicus. According to this theory the universe was geocentric. The earth was surrounded by a series of concentric transparent spheres in each of which was fixed one of the 'seven planets', viz. the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and [Saturn](#appendix002.xhtml_g120){#chapter003-fn.xhtml_p120}. (Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were not discovered until the eighteenth century and later.) Beyond the sphere of Saturn lay the sphere of the fixed stars, and beyond that the *Primum Mobil*., which is caused by God to rotate on its own axis once in every twenty-four hours, the speed of the rotation being very high on account of the vast size of the sphere. As it rotates the *Primum Mobil*. communicates its motion to the sphere lying contiguous to it, which is thus moved in the same direction, but at a slower speed; the motion of the sphere of the fixed stars is communicated in turn to the sphere of Saturn, and so it progresses through the other six spheres. In this way the observable motions of the heavenly bodies were accounted for, though the Aristotelian account, with which Boethius was acquainted, and the full details of the Ptolemaic account are much more complex than this brief outline. (See for the Ptolemaic system A. C. Crombie, *Augustine to Galile*., Mercury Books no. 3, p[p. 82](#chapter003.xhtml_con0000983){#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001410} ff. and for Aristotle, W. D. Ross, *Aristotl*., London, 1923 etc., pp. 96 -- 7.) It is the abstract mathematical complexity of the system which regulates the movements of the planets which Boethius finds really wonderful, not just the physical construction of the universe or the immense speed of its rotation.

[**13**](#chapter003.xhtml_con0000863){#chapter003-fn.xhtml_con0001420}. The application of the word 'substance' in this passage may seem strange. It is, in fact, a technical term of Aristotelian metaphysics, denoting the individual thing about which assertions can be made. For Aristotle, a substance is simply a real thing which actually exists, but since in his view matter is something negative without proper characteristics of its own, that which makes things definite and distinguishable is their form. 'The sensible individuals cannot be defined owing to the material element in them, which renders them perishable and makes them obscure to our knowledge. On the other hand, substance is primarily the definable essence or form of a thing, the principle in virtue of which the material element is some definite concrete object. It follows from this that substance is primarily form which is, in itself, immaterial, so that if Aristotle begins by asserting that individual sensible objects are substances, the course of his thought carries him on towards the view that pure form alone is truly and primarily substance. But the only forms that are really independent of matter are God, the Intelligences of the spheres and the active intellect in man, so that it is these forms which are primarily substance.' (Copleston, op. cit., I, ii, p. **48**.) This teaching is alluded to by Boethius in his tractate *On the Trinit*., where he adds, 'When we say God, we seem to denote a substance; but it is a substance that is supersubstantial.' (Loeb Classical Library ed., p. **17**.) The same sort of language is, of course, met with in the Nicene Creed where the Son is said to be of one substance with the Father.

. In this poem we have an account of the ascent of the soul to God, which must
be understood in terms of the Boethian cosmos. The mind rises from the earth through
the air to the sphere of the moon. At this point it leaves that part of the universe
composed of the four elements, earth, air, water and fire; fire being the lightest
of these has risen to just below the orbit of the moon where it forms its own
sphere. Beyond the moon is the fifth element, the quintessence or ether. The soul
continues to rise through the spheres of the stars (i.e. the wandering stars or
planets as opposed to the fixed stars which are only reached in lines
13--14 after passing through the spheres of Mercury, Venus, Phoebus (=
thesun), Mars, Jupiter and Saturn). Eventually the soul passes beyond the ether and
reaches God, the source of the light emanating through the universe. The universe is
turned inside out, as it were. God is seen as the centre of light. Earth as a place
of darkness on the very edge of the universe. At birth the soul emanates or descends
to the earth from God, and its ascent is an account of its return. See A. H.
Armstrong, *An Introduction to Ancient Philosophy*, 3rd ed., London, 1957,
Ch. 16, and F. Copleston, *A History of Philosophy*, Vol. 1, part ii, Ch. 45

'inversion' of the universe from geocentric to theocentric. Cf.
too the comparison of God to the still point in the middle of a series of concentric
circles in IV, 6, a figure drawn from Plotinus. The metre was well known in the
middle ages and sprang to Chaucer's mind as he was carried aloft by the
eagle in the *Hous of Fame*, ii. 972.

I therefore follow Bieler's suggestion that the original reading was
something like *qui minime apprehendunt*; this, he suggests, was glossed
*id*. (= *id est) scelesti*, which was later misinterpreted as
*idem scelesti* and incorporated in the text to the exclusion of the true

(95--46 [BC]{.small}) was well known for his rigid
morality. He joined Pompey in the civil war against Caesar, and committed suicide
rather than suffer capture after Caesar's victory in the battle of
Thapsus. Lucan characterizes Cato as the personification of Godlike virtue; see
especially *Pharsali*., book IX.

by the Trojan prince, Paris, with Helen, the wife of Agamemnon's brother
Menelaus. Agamemnon became commander-in-chief of the Greek expedition to recover
Helen, and was forced to sacrifice his daughter, Iphigeneia, to the Goddess Artemis,
whom he had offended, before the fleet could obtain a fair wind for the voyage to
Troy. After ten years of seige Troy was eventually sacked by the Greeks.

his adventures on the home ward journey from Troy concerned the one-eyed Cyclops,
Polyphemus, who captured Odysseus and his men in his cave and began to eat them.
Polyphemus became drunk, and while he slept Odysseus and his men heated a stave and
put out his eye. Thus blinded, the giant was unable to prevent their escape. See the

[**5**](#chapter005.xhtml_con0001264){#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001485}. 'Intelligence' (Latin *intelligentia*. in this passage bears a technical sense related to the two faculties which the rational soul was supposed to exercise, 'intellect' *(intellects*. and 'reason' *(ratio)*. 'Intellect' here means 'understanding' and is that imperfect faculty in corporeal man which corresponds to the perfect 'intelligence' of incorporeal angels: its relation to 'reason' is explained by St Thomas Aquinas (Ia, lxxxix, art. 8) as follows (quoted from *The Discarded Image*. p. 157): 'intellect *(intelligere*. is the simple (i.e. indivisible, uncompounded) grasp of an intelligible truth, whereas reasoning *(ratio-cinari*. is the progression towards an intelligible truth by going from one understood *(intellecto*. point to another. The difference between them is thus like the difference between rest and motion or between possession and acquisition. 'C. S. Lewis continues (loc. ci*t.)*. 'We are enjoying *intellect*. when we ''just see'' a self-evident truth; we are exercising *rati*. when we proceed step by step to prove a truth which is not self-evident. A cognitive life in which all truth can be simply ''seen'' would be the life of an *intelligentia*. an angel. A life of unmitigated *rati*. where nothing was simply ''seen'' and all had to be proved, would presumably be impossible; for nothing can be proved if nothing is self-evident. Man's mental life is spent in laboriously connecting those frequent, but momentary, flashes of *intelligenti*. which constitute *intellects.'*.

[**6**](#chapter005.xhtml_con0001265){#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001487}The source of this argument that knowledge depends on the capacity of the knower to know, and not the capacity of the object to be known, is in the writings of [Iamblichus](#appendix002.xhtml_g71){#chapter005-fn.xhtml_p71}, [Ammonius](#appendix002.xhtml_g9){#chapter005-fn.xhtml_p9} and Proclus. Two terms in the passage need a short comment: *universa*. and *form*. Of the former Aristotle says, 'By the term *universa*. I mean that which is of such a nature as to be predicated of many subjects' *(De Interpretations*. 17a), e.g. the concept 'horse' as opposed to many individual horses. But for Aristotle the *universa*. was not just a subjective concept; it was something real both in the mind and in things. 'Strictly speaking, there is no objective Universal for Aristotle, but there is an objective foundation in things for the subjective universal in the mind. The universal ''horse'' is a subjective concept, but it has an objective foundation in the substantial forms that inform particular horses.' (F. Copleston, *A History of Philosophy*. I, ch. 29.) Similarly for Plato, the *universal*. to which he gave the name *idea or form*. was something real, but unlike Aristotle Plato accorded *the for*. a separate substance in a non-sensible world of 'real reality' different from the unreal everyday world of sense perception. The use of the word *for*. in this passage seems to be closer to St Augustine, who follows the Middle Academy and Plotinus, than to Plato: cf the words of Boyer, *L'Idee de la Verite*. quoted by M. C. D'Arcy, S. J., in his essay on St Augustine's philosophy in *A Monumentto St Augustine*. London, 1930 (reprinted as *St Augustin*. by Meridian Books, 1957): 'Our intellect is, in fact, nothing else than the divine Light tempered to the infirmity of our nature. The truths we see are partial, limited, made clumsy by the multiplicity of the terms. Nevertheless, they are the expression, suited to our nature, of the total and simple truth, which is God. No one of our ideas, whatever we do, reveals to us the pure Idea which is in God, but each of our ideas, in its positive content, expresses something which belongs to God, although under a form which the idea does not reveal.' The 'simple form' --or pure idea --which is the subject of the knowledge of intelligence is like the Augustinian forms in the mind of God, that is, in Christ, the Divine Wisdom. 'There are certain ideas,' he writes in *De diversis questionibus*. 83, q.46, 'forms, or reasons, of things which are immutable and constant, which are immaterial and contained in the divine intellect. . .'

The Stoics take their name from the Painted Stoa or Colonnade at Athens where [Zeno of Citium](#appendix002.xhtml_g144){#chapter005-fn.xhtml_p144} (335--263 [BC]{.small}), the founder of Stoicism, carried on his teaching. Stoicism was a materialist philosophy; only bodies had a real substantial existence, and the Stoic theory of knowledge was, therefore, an account of how the soul, itself a body, was affected by other bodies --the things that are known. Cleanthes (331 -- 232), who succeeded Zeno, actually used the metaphor of a seal impressed on wax to describe the impression an object makes on the soul in sense-perception. There was no place in this materialist system for objectively existing universals like Plato's *forms*. The active power of mind which Boethius opposes to this theory of passive receptivity seems to owe something to Aristotle's problematic Active Reason. (See A. H. Armstrong, *An Introduction to Ancient Philosophy*. University Paperbacks, 1965, p[p. 96](#chapter004.xhtml_con0001073){#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001491} -- 7.)

[**8**](#chapter005.xhtml_con0001287){#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001494}With deliberate artistry Boethius recalls -- and contrasts -- the picture of the sufferer contemplating with downcast eyes the lowly dust in I, 2.

[**9**](#chapter005.xhtml_con0001292){#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001496}For much of the following section Boethius follows his Neoplatonist sources: but his exultant definition (of Helen Waddell, *The Wandering Scholars*. Pelican Books, 1954, [p. 27](#chapter002.xhtml_con0000575){#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001497}) of eternity is remarkably close to the view of St Augustine. For him the universe was not created in time, but with time. In virtue of His eternity, God transcends time. Created things came into existence only in time. God knew them before their creation and it is in virtue of this eternal act of knowledge that He can foresee and know beforehand even the free acts of men. Cf. Copleston, op. cit., II, ch. 5, sections 4 and 5.

[**10**](#chapter005.xhtml_con0001304){#chapter005-fn.xhtml_con0001500}. For his distinction between simple and conditional or hypothetical necessity, Boethius relies ultimately on Aristotle. The distinction is parallel to that already used by Boethius and likewise derived from Aristotle --along with the example of the buried gold --between absolute and incidental causes in the explanation of chance in Chapter I of book V. For a full and illuminating analysis of the way in which Boethius turns at the end of his work from the Platonic to the Aristotelian tradition for his final solution of the problem of necessity and free will, see H. R. Patch, *Necessity in Boethius and the Neoplatonists*. in *Speculum*. X, 1935, pp. 393 -- 404.
