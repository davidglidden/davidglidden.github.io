[The mel­an­choly sci­ence, from which I make this of­fer­ing to my friend, relates to a realm which has coun­ted, since time im­me­morial, as the au­then­tic one of philo­sophy, but which has, since its trans­form­a­tion into method, fallen prey to in­tel­lec­tual dis­respect, sen­ten­tious caprice and in the end for­get­ful­ness: the teach­ing of the good life. What philo­sophy once called life, has turned into the sphere of the private and then merely of con­sump­tion, which is dragged along as an ad­dendum of the ma­ter­ial pro­duc­tion-pro­cess, without autonomy and without its own sub­stance. Who­ever wishes to ex­per­i­ence the truth of im­me­di­ate life, must in­vest­ig­ate its ali­en­ated form, the ob­ject­ive powers, which de­term­ine the in­di­vidual ex­ist­ence into its in­ner­most re­cesses. To speak im­me­di­ately of what is im­me­di­ate, is to be­have no dif­fer­ently from that nov­el­ist, who ad­orns their ma­ri­on­ettes with the im­it­a­tions of the pas­sions of yes­teryear like cheap jew­elry, and who sets per­sons in mo­tion, who are noth­ing other than in­vent­ory-pieces of ma­chinery, as if they could still act as sub­jects, and as if some­thing really de­pended on their ac­tions. The gaze at life has passed over into ideo­logy, which con­ceals the fact, that it no longer ex­ists.]{.calibre3}

[But the re­la­tion­ship of life and pro­duc­tion, which the lat­ter de­grades in real­ity into an eph­em­eral ap­pear­ance of the former, is com­pletely ab­surd. Means and ends are in­ter­changed. The in­tu­ition of this ludicrous quid pro quo has not been totally ex­punged from life. The re­duced and de­graded es­sence bristles ten­a­ciously against its en­sor­cel­ment in the façade. The change of the re­la­tions of pro­duc­tion it­self de­pends more than ever on what be­falls the "sphere of con­sump­tion," the mere re­flec­tion-form of pro­duc­tion and the ca­ri­ca­ture of true life: in the con­scious­ness and un­con­scious­ness of in­di­vidu­als. Only by vir­tue of op­pos­i­tion to pro­duc­tion, as some­thing still not totally en­com­passed by the so­cial or­der, could hu­man be­ings in­tro­duce a more hu­mane one. If the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of life were ever wholly ab­rog­ated, which the con­sump­tion-sphere it­self de­fends with such bad reas­ons, then the over­growth of ab­so­lute pro­duc­tion will tri­umph.]{.calibre3}

[In spite of this, con­sid­er­a­tions which be­gin from the sub­ject have as much that is false in them, so much as life be­comes ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\]. Be­cause the over­whelm­ing ob­jectiv­ity of the con­tem­por­ary phase of his­tor­ical move­ment con­sists solely of the dis­sol­u­tion of the sub­ject, without a new one ap­pear­ing in its stead, in­di­vidual ex­per­i­ence ne­ces­sar­ily re­lies on the old sub­ject, the his­tor­ic­ally con­demned one, which is still for it­self, but no longer in it­self. It thinks of its autonomy as still se­cure, but the nullity, which the con­cen­tra­tion camps demon­strated to sub­jects, already over­takes the form of sub­jectiv­ity it­self. Some­thing sen­ti­mental and ana­chron­istic clings to the sub­ject­ive con­sid­er­a­tion, no mat­ter how crit­ic­ally sharpened against it­self: some­thing of the lament about the way of the world, which is not to be re­jec­ted for the sake of its good in­ten­tions, but be­cause the lament­ing sub­ject threatens to harden in its be­ing-just-so \[]{.calibre3}[So­sein]{.calibre22}[\] and thereby to ful­fill once again the law of the way of the world. The fi­del­ity to one's own state of con­scious­ness and ex­per­i­ence is forever in tempta­tion of fall­ing into in­fi­del­ity, by deny­ing the in­sight, which reaches bey­ond the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] and which calls the lat­ter's sub­stance by name. ]{.calibre3}

[Thus ar­gued Hegel, whose method schooled that of ]{.calibre3}[Min­ima Mor­alia]{.calibre22}[, against the mere be­ing-for-it­self of sub­jectiv­ity on all its levels. Dia­lect­ical the­ory, averse to everything which is sin­gu­lar, can­not per­mit aph­or­isms to be valid as such. In the best of cases they may be tol­er­ated, in the words of the ]{.calibre3}[Pre­face]{.calibre22}[ of the ]{.calibre3}[Phe­nomen­o­logy of Spirit]{.calibre22}[, as "con­ver­sa­tion." The lat­ter's time how­ever is over. Nev­er­the­less the book does not for­get the to­tal­ity-claim of the sys­tem, which does not wish any­one to es­cape it, any more than the re­bel­lion against the lat­ter. Hegel does not pay heed to the sub­ject in ac­cord­ance with the re­quire­ment, which he oth­er­wise pas­sion­ately de­fends: that of be­ing in the mat­ter \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[\] and not "al­ways bey­ond it," in­stead of "en­ter­ing into the im­man­ent con­tent of the mat­ter \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[\]." If the sub­ject is dis­ap­pear­ing today, aph­or­isms take on the weighty re­spons­ib­il­ity of "con­sid­er­ing that which is dis­ap­pear­ing it­self as es­sen­tial." They in­sist, in op­pos­i­tion to Hegel's pro­ced­ure and nev­er­the­less in con­cord­ance with his thought, on neg­at­iv­ity: "The life of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[\] wins its truth only by find­ing it­self in what is ab­so­lutely torn apart. It is not this power as the pos­it­ive, which looks away from the neg­at­ive, as when we say of some­thing, that it is noth­ing or wrong, and now, done with that, pass over from there to some­thing else; rather it is this power only when it stares the neg­at­ive in the face, tar­ry­ing on it."]{.calibre3}

[The dis­missive ges­ture, with which Hegel in con­tra­dic­tion to his own in­sight, con­stantly runs rough­shod over the in­di­vidual, de­rives para­dox­ic­ally enough from his ne­ces­sary bias for lib­er­al­istic thought. The con­cep­tion of a to­tal­ity har­mo­ni­ous through­out all its ant­ag­on­isms com­pels him to rank in­di­vidu­ation, how­ever many times he des­ig­nates it as the driv­ing mo­ment of the pro­cess, as some­thing lesser in the con­struc­tion of the whole. That in pre­his­tory the ob­ject­ive tend­ency as­serts it­self over the heads of hu­man be­ings, in­deed by vir­tue of the an­ni­hil­a­tion of the in­di­vidual, without the re­con­cili­ation im­plied by the concept of the gen­er­al­ity and the par­tic­u­lar ever be­ing his­tor­ic­ally achieved, this is dis­tor­ted in Hegel: with lofty ici­ness he opts once more for the li­quid­a­tion of the par­tic­u­lar. Nowhere does he doubt the primacy of the whole. The more du­bi­ous the trans­ition from the re­flect­ing sin­gu­lar­iz­a­tion to the glor­i­fied to­tal­ity re­mains, as much in his­tory as in Hegel­ian lo­gic, the more en­thu­si­ast­ic­ally philo­sophy clings, as jus­ti­fic­a­tion of the ex­ist­ent, to the vic­tori­ous mo­tor­cade of the ob­ject­ive tend­ency. The de­vel­op­ment of the so­cial prin­ciple of in­di­vidu­ation into the vic­tory of fatal­ity already gives it oc­ca­sion enough. Since Hegel hy­po­stat­izes bour­geois so­ci­ety as much as its found­ing cat­egory, the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\], he could not truly carry out the dia­lectic between the two. Ad­mit­tedly, he as­sures us, with clas­sical eco­nom­ics, that the to­tal­ity pro­duces and re­pro­duces it­self out of the in­ter­re­la­tion of the ant­ag­on­istic in­terests of its mem­bers. But he na­ively re­gards the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] as such solely as that which is ir­re­du­cibly given \[]{.calibre3}[Gegeben­heit]{.calibre22}[\], which he just dis­mantled in his the­ory of cog­ni­tion. In the in­di­vidu­al­istic so­ci­ety how­ever the gen­er­al­ity is real­ized not only through the in­ter­play of in­di­vidu­als, rather the so­ci­ety is es­sen­tially the sub­stance of the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\].]{.calibre3}

[That is why so­cial ana­lysis can garner in­com­par­ably more from in­di­vidual ex­per­i­ence than Hegel con­ceded, while con­versely the great his­tor­ical cat­egor­ies, after all that has been per­pet­rated with them in the mean­time, are no longer above sus­pi­cion of fraud. In the one hun­dred and fifty years which have passed since Hegel's con­cep­tion, some­thing of the force of protest has passed over again into the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\]. Com­pared with the pa­ter­fa­milial scanti­ness, which char­ac­ter­izes its treat­ment in Hegel, it has won as much rich­ness, dif­fer­en­ti­ation and en­ergy as it has, on the other hand, been weakened and hol­lowed out by the so­cial­iz­a­tion of so­ci­ety. In the epoch of its dis­as­sembly \[]{.calibre3}[Zer­falls]{.calibre22}[\], the ex­per­i­ence of the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] as well as what it en­coun­ters con­trib­utes once more to a re­cog­ni­tion, which it had con­cealed, so long as it was con­strued seam­lessly and pos­it­ively as the rul­ing cat­egory. In view of the to­tal­it­arian uni­son, which broad­casts the elim­in­a­tion of dif­fer­ence as im­me­di­ately mean­ing­ful, a meas­ure of eman­cip­at­ory so­cial power may have tem­por­ar­ily with­drawn into the sphere of the in­di­vidual. That crit­ical the­ory tar­ries in it, is not only due to a bad con­science.]{.calibre3}

[All this is not to deny what is de­bat­able in such an at­tempt. I wrote the book for the most part dur­ing the war, un­der con­di­tions of con­tem­pla­tion. The vi­ol­ence which drove me into ex­ile sim­ul­tan­eously blocked me from its full re­cog­ni­tion. I had not yet ad­mit­ted to my­self the com­pli­city of those who, as if in a ma­gic circle, speak at all of what is in­di­vidual, in view of the un­speak­able things which col­lect­ively oc­curred.]{.calibre3}

[Each of the three parts starts out from the nar­row­est private realm, that of the in­tel­lec­tual in emig­ra­tion. After this fol­low con­sid­er­a­tions of wider so­cial and an­thro­po­lo­gical scope; they per­tain to psy­cho­logy, aes­thet­ics, and sci­ence in its re­la­tion­ship to the sub­ject. The con­clud­ing aph­or­isms of each sec­tion lead them­at­ic­ally, too, to philo­sophy, without claim­ing to be con­clus­ive and defin­it­ive: all of these are in­ten­ded to mark points of at­tack or to gen­er­ate mod­els for fu­ture ex­er­tions of the concept.]{.calibre3}

[The im­me­di­ate oc­ca­sion for writ­ing this book was the fiftieth birth­day of Max Horkheimer on Feb­ru­ary 14, 1945. The com­pos­i­tion tran­spired in a phase in which, due to ex­ternal cir­cum­stances, we had to in­ter­rupt our com­mon work. The book wishes to prof­fer thanks and fi­del­ity, by re­fus­ing to re­cog­nize the in­ter­rup­tion. It is testi­mony to a ]{.calibre3}[dia­logue in­ter­iéur]{.calibre22}[ \[French: in­ternal dia­logue\]: there is no mo­tif herein, which does not be­long as much to Horkheimer as to the per­son who found the time for for­mu­la­tion.]{.calibre3}

[The spe­cific ap­proach of ]{.calibre3}[Min­ima Mor­alia]{.calibre22}[, the at­tempt to rep­res­ent mo­ments of a com­mon philo­sophy from the stand­point of sub­ject­ive ex­per­i­ence, means that the pieces do not en­tirely meas­ure up to the philo­sophy, of which they are nev­er­the­less a part. This is ex­pressed as what is loose and non­bind­ing in the form, along with the re­nun­ci­ation of an ex­pli­cit the­or­et­ical con­text. At the same time, such as­ceti­cism should atone for some­thing of the in­justice, wherein one con­tin­ued to work alone on some­thing which can only be com­pleted by both, and from which we shall not de­sist.]{.calibre3}

[For Mar­cel Proust. -- ]{.calibre22}[The son of well-to-do par­ents who, whether out of tal­ent or weak­ness, chooses a so-called in­tel­lec­tual oc­cu­pa­tion as an artist or scholar, has spe­cial dif­fi­culties with those who bear the dis­taste­ful title of col­leagues. It is not merely that his in­de­pend­ence is en­vied, that the ser­i­ous­ness of his in­ten­tions is doubted and that he is pre­sumed to be a secret en­voy of the es­tab­lished powers. Such mis­trust is borne out of re­sent­ment, yet would usu­ally find its con­firm­a­tion. How­ever the ac­tual res­ist­ances lie else­where. The oc­cu­pa­tion with in­tel­lec­tual \[]{.calibre3}[geisti­gen]{.calibre22}[\] things has mean­while be­come "prac­tical," a busi­ness with a strict di­vi­sion of labor, with branches and ]{.calibre3}[nu­merus clausus]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: re­stric­ted entry\]. Those who are ma­ter­i­ally in­de­pend­ent, who choose out of re­pug­nance to­wards the shame of earn­ing money, are not in­clined to re­cog­nize this. For this he is pun­ished. He is no "pro­fes­sional" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], ranks in the hier­archy of com­pet­it­ors as a di­let­tante, re­gard­less of how much he knows about his sub­ject, and must, if he wishes to pur­sue a ca­reer, dis­play a pro­fes­sional tun­nel vis­ion even nar­rower than that of the most nar­row-minded ex­pert. The sus­pen­sion of the di­vi­sion of labor to which he is driven, and which the eco­nomic state of af­fairs al­lows him, within cer­tain lim­its, to real­ize, is con­sidered es­pe­cially scan­dal­ous: this be­trays the aver­sion to sanc­tion the hustle and bustle dic­tated by so­ci­ety, and high and mighty com­pet­ence does not per­mit such idio­syn­crasies. The de­part­ment­al­iz­a­tion of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] is a means of ab­ol­ish­ing such there, where it is not ex of­fi­cio or con­trac­tu­ally ob­lig­ated. It does its work all the more surely, as those who con­tinu­ally re­ject the di­vi­sion of labor -- if only in the sense that they en­joy their work -- re­veal, by this self­same meas­ure, their vul­ner­ab­il­it­ies, which are in­sep­ar­able from the mo­ments of their su­peri­or­ity. Thus is the so­cial or­der \[]{.calibre3}[Ord­nung]{.calibre22}[\] as­sured: this one must play along, be­cause one could not oth­er­wise live, and that one, who could in­deed live, is kept out­side, be­cause they don't want to play along. It is as if the class which the in­de­pend­ent in­tel­lec­tual deser­ted from re­venges it­self, by for­cibly push­ing through its de­mands pre­cisely where the deserter sought refuge.]{.calibre3}

### [2]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

[Grassy seat. -- ]{.calibre22}[The re­la­tion­ship to par­ents is un­der­go­ing a sad, shad­owy change. They have lost their awe through their eco­nomic power­less­ness. Once we re­belled against their in­sist­ence on the real­ity prin­ciple, the sobri­ety which was al­ways ready to re­coil into the rage against those who do not re­nounce. Today how­ever we find ourselves fa­cing a pre­sum­ably younger gen­er­a­tion, which is in every one of its im­pulses un­bear­ably more grown up than the par­ents ever were; which has re­nounced, be­fore things ever came to a con­flict, and which de­rives their au­thor­ity from that, im­plac­ably au­thor­it­arian and un­shake­able. Per­haps one al­ways ex­per­i­enced the par­ental gen­er­a­tion as harm­less and dis­em­powered, once the lat­ter's phys­ical en­ergy sub­sided, while one's own gen­er­a­tion seemed to be threatened by youth: in the ant­ag­on­istic so­ci­ety, the re­la­tion­ship of the gen­er­a­tions is also one of com­pet­i­tion, be­hind which stands na­ked vi­ol­ence. Today how­ever things are re­gress­ing to a con­di­tion which does not know the Oed­ipus com­plex, but only the slay­ing of the father. One of the most telling sym­bolic at­ro­cit­ies of the Nazis was the killing of the ex­tremely old. Such a cli­mate pro­duces a be­lated and rue­ful un­der­stand­ing with one's par­ents, sim­ilar to the one between con­demned pris­on­ers, dis­turbed only by the fear that we, ourselves power­less, may not be able to care for them some day as they cared for us, when they owned some­thing. The vi­ol­ence which is in­flic­ted on them makes us for­get the vi­ol­ence they com­mit­ted. Even their ra­tion­al­iz­a­tions, the once-hated lies with which they sought to jus­tify their par­tic­u­lar in­terest as the gen­eral one, show an ink­ling of the truth, the urge to­wards the re­con­cili­ation of con­flicts, which the up­beat suc­cessor gen­er­a­tion hap­pily denies. Even the faded, in­con­sequen­tial and self-doubt­ing Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] of the eld­ers is more ap­proach­able than the quick-wit­ted stu­pid­ity of ju­nior. Even the neur­otic pe­cu­li­ar­it­ies and mal­form­a­tions of the older adults rep­res­ent char­ac­ter, that which is hu­manly achieved, com­pared with pathic health, in­fant­il­ism raised to a norm. One real­izes in hor­ror that when one pre­vi­ously clashed with one's par­ents, be­cause they rep­res­en­ted the world, one was secretly the mouth­piece of a still worse world against the merely bad. Un­polit­ical at­tempts to break out of the bour­geois fam­ily usu­ally only lead to deeper en­tan­gle­ment in such, and some­times it seems as if the dis­astrous germ-cell of so­ci­ety, the fam­ily, is sim­ul­tan­eously the nour­ish­ing germ-cell of the un­com­prom­ising will for a dif­fer­ent one. What dis­in­teg­rates, along with the fam­ily -- so long as the sys­tem con­tin­ues -- is not just the most ef­fect­ive agency of the bour­geoisie, but also the res­ist­ance which in­deed op­pressed the in­di­vidual, but also strengthened the lat­ter, if not in­deed pro­du­cing such. The end of the fam­ily cripples the counter-forces. The dawn­ing col­lect­iv­istic so­cial or­der \[]{.calibre3}[Ord­nung]{.calibre22}[\] is the mock­ery of one without class: it li­quid­ates, along with the bour­geois, at the same time the uto­pia, which at one time drew nour­ish­ment from the mother's love.]{.calibre3}

### [3]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

[Fish in wa­ter]{.calibre22}[. -- Since the com­pre­hens­ive ap­par­atus of dis­tri­bu­tion of highly con­cen­trated in­dustry has dis­solved the cir­cu­la­tion-sphere, this lat­ter be­gins an as­ton­ish­ing post-ex­ist­ence. While the eco­nomic basis for the oc­cu­pa­tion of go-betweens dis­ap­pears, the private life of in­nu­mer­able people be­comes that of agents and go-betweens, in­deed the realm of the private is wholly swal­lowed up by a mys­ter­i­ous en­ter­prise \[Geschäftigkeit: busi­ness, activ­ity, bu­sy­n­ess\], which bears all the marks of the com­mer­cial kind, only in a situ­ation where noth­ing is really be­ing done. Those who are afraid, from the un­em­ployed to pro­fes­sion­als who in the next mo­ment may come to feel the wrath of those whose in­vest­ments they rep­res­ent, be­lieve they can win over the ubi­quit­ous com­pany ex­ec­ut­ive only through sens­it­iv­ity, as­sidu­ous­ness, ac­cess­ib­il­ity, by one way or an­other, through the qual­it­ies of traders, and soon there is no re­la­tion­ship which is not seen in terms of other re­la­tion­ships, no im­pulse which is not sub­jec­ted to prior cen­sor­ship, in or­der not to de­vi­ate from ap­proval. The concept of re­la­tion­ships, a cat­egory of me­di­ation and cir­cu­la­tion, never prospered best in the ac­tual cir­cu­la­tion-sphere, in the mar­ket, but in closed, mono­poly-like hier­arch­ies. Now that the en­tire so­ci­ety is be­com­ing hier­archal, opaque re­la­tion­ships ad­here every­where, wherever there was still the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of free­dom. The ir­ra­tion­al­ity of the sys­tem is ex­pressed not less in the eco­nomic fate of par­tic­u­lar in­di­vidu­als \[]{.calibre3}[Ein­zelnen]{.calibre22}[\] than in the para­sitic psy­cho­logy of such. Earlier, when there was still some­thing like the dis­rep­ut­able bour­geois sep­ar­a­tion of oc­cu­pa­tion and private life, whose passing one would al­most like to re­gret, who­ever pur­sued goals in their private life was eyed with dis­trust, as a lout­ish gate­crasher. Today who­ever en­gages in some­thing private, which does not have a dis­cern­ible goal, ap­pears as ar­rog­ant, for­eign and im­proper. Who­ever isn't "out" for some­thing \[]{.calibre3}[wer nichts]{.calibre22}[ "will": lit­er­ally, who­ever doesn't want, wish, in­tend to do some­thing\] is al­most sus­pect: no-one trusts any­one else to help them get by, without le­git­im­at­ing them­selves through counter-claims. Myri­ads of people make their liv­ing out of a con­di­tion, which fol­lows the li­quid­a­tion of oc­cu­pa­tions. These are the nice people, the pop­u­lar ones, who are friends with all, the just ones, who ex­cuse every sort of mean­ness as "hu­man" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] and in­cor­rupt­ibly de­fame every non-nor­mal­ized im­pulse as "sen­ti­mental" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]. They are in­dis­pens­able thanks to their know­ledge of all the chan­nels and back doors of power, they guess its most secret judg­ments and live off the dex­ter­ous com­mu­nic­a­tion of such. They are to be found in all polit­ical camps, even there, where the re­jec­tion of the sys­tem is taken for gran­ted and for that reason a lax and cun­ning con­form­ism of its own has de­veloped. Of­ten they win over people through a cer­tain be­ne­vol­ence, through the sym­path­etic shar­ing of the life of oth­ers: self­less­ness as spec­u­la­tion. They are clever, witty, sens­ible and flex­ible; they have pol­ished the old trader-spirit with the achieve­ments of the day-be­fore-yes­ter­day's psy­cho­logy. They are ready for any­thing, even love, yet al­ways faith­lessly. They be­tray not from in­stinctual drives, but from prin­ciple: they value even them­selves as a profit, which they do not wish to share with any­one else. They are bound to the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] with af­fin­ity and hate: they are a tempta­tion for the thought­ful, but also their worst en­emies. For they are the ones who subtly ap­pre­hend and de­spoil the last hid­ing-places of res­ist­ance, the hours which re­main free from the de­mands of the ma­chinery. Their be­lated in­di­vidu­al­ism pois­ons what still re­mains of the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[: in­di­vidual, the in­di­vidu­ated\].]{.calibre3}

[Fi­nal clar­ity]{.calibre22}[. -- The news­pa­per ob­it­u­ary for a busi­ness­man once read: "The breadth of his con­science com­peted with the good­ness of his heart." The lapse com­mit­ted by the mourn­ers in the rar­efied, el­ev­ated lan­guage called for at such times, the in­vol­un­tary ad­mis­sion that the kind-hearted de­ceased was devoid of a con­science, ex­ped­ites the fu­neral pro­ces­sion on the shortest path to the land of truth. When a man of ad­vanced age be­comes fam­ous for be­ing es­pe­cially be­nign \[]{.calibre3}[abgeklärt]{.calibre22}[: cla­ri­fied, mel­lowed\], one can pre­sume that his life rep­res­en­ted a series of scan­dals. He has got­ten used to out­rage. The broad con­science passes it­self off as great­ness of mind \[]{.calibre3}[Weitherzigkeit]{.calibre22}[\], which for­gives everything, be­cause it un­der­stands it all too well. A quid pro quo steps between one's own guilt and that of oth­ers, which is re­solved in fa­vor of who­ever got the best of the deal. After such a long life, one just can't dis­tin­guish who did what to whom. In the ab­stract rep­res­ent­a­tion of uni­ver­sal in­justice, every con­crete re­spons­ib­il­ity col­lapses. The scoun­drel twists it around, as if he ex­per­i­enced it him­self: if you only knew, young man, what life is really like. Those how­ever who are already dis­tin­guished in the middle of life by spe­cial be­ne­vol­ence, are usu­ally draw­ing an ad­vance on such be­nig­nity \[]{.calibre3}[Abgeklär­theit]{.calibre22}[\]. Who­ever is not evil, does not live be­nignly \[]{.calibre3}[abgeklärt]{.calibre22}[\], but in a pe­cu­li­arly bash­ful man­ner, hardened and in­tol­er­ant. Due to a lack of ap­pro­pri­ate ob­jects, the lat­ter hardly knows any other ex­pres­sion of their love than the hatred of in­ap­pro­pri­ate ones, through which they ad­mit­tedly come to re­semble what they hate. The bour­geoisie how­ever is tol­er­ant. Their love for people, as they are, ori­gin­ates in the hatred of right­ful hu­man be­ings. ]{.calibre3}

### [5]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

[Doc­tor, that is kind of you]{.calibre22}[. -- Noth­ing is harm­less any­more. The small joys, the ex­pres­sions of life, which seemed to be ex­empt from the re­spons­ib­il­ity of thought, not only have a mo­ment of de­fi­ant sil­li­ness, of the cold-hearted turn­ing of a blind eye, but im­me­di­ately enter the ser­vice of their most ex­treme op­pos­ite. Even the tree which blooms, lies, the mo­ment that one per­ceives its bloom without the shadow of hor­ror; even the in­no­cent "How beau­ti­ful" be­comes an ex­cuse for the ig­no­miny of ex­ist­ence, which is oth­er­wise, and there is no longer any beauty or any con­sol­a­tion, ex­cept in the gaze which goes straight to the hor­ror, with­stands it, and in the un­di­min­ished con­scious­ness of neg­at­iv­ity, holds fast to the pos­sib­il­ity of that which is bet­ter. Mis­trust is ad­vis­able to­wards everything which is un­self­con­scious, cas­ual, to­wards everything which in­volves let­ting go, im­ply­ing in­dul­gence to­wards the su­prem­acy of the ex­ist­ent \[]{.calibre3}[Ex­isti­er­ende]{.calibre22}[\]. The ma­lign deeper mean­ing of com­fort, which at one time was lim­ited to the toasts of cozy so­ci­ab­il­ity, has long since spread to friend­lier im­pulses. When in the chance con­ver­sa­tion with a man on the train, one ac­qui­esces, in or­der to avoid a quar­rel, to a couple of sen­tences which one knows ul­ti­mately cer­tify murder, is already an act of treach­ery; no thought is im­mune against its com­mu­nic­a­tion, and ut­ter­ing it at the wrong place and in the con­text of a false agree­ment is enough to un­der­cut its truth. Every visit to the cinema, des­pite the ut­most watch­ful­ness, leaves me dumber and worse than be­fore. So­ci­ab­il­ity it­self is a par­ti­cipant in in­justice, in­so­far as it pre­tends we can still talk with each other in a frozen world, and the flip­pant, chummy word con­trib­utes to the per­petu­ation of si­lence, in­so­far as the con­ces­sions to those be­ing ad­dressed de­base the lat­ter once more as speak­ers. The evil prin­ciple which has al­ways lurked in af­fabil­ity de­vel­ops, in the egal­it­arian Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], into its full bes­ti­al­ity. Con­des­cen­sion and mak­ing one­self out as no bet­ter are the same. By ad­apt­ing to the weak­nesses of the op­pressed, one con­firms in such weak­nesses the pre­requis­ite of dom­in­a­tion, and de­vel­ops in one­self the meas­ure of bar­bar­ity, thick­headed­ness and ca­pa­city to in­flict vi­ol­ence re­quired to ex­er­cise dom­in­a­tion. If, in the latest era, the ges­ture of con­des­cen­sion is dis­pensed with, and solely ad­apt­a­tion be­comes vis­ible, then it is pre­cisely in such a per­fect screen­ing of power that the class-re­la­tion­ship, how­ever denied, breaks through all the more ir­re­con­cil­ably. For in­tel­lec­tu­als, un­swerving isol­a­tion is the only form in which they can vouch­safe a meas­ure of solid­ar­ity. All of the play­ing along, all of the hu­man­ity of in­ter­ac­tion and par­ti­cip­a­tion is the mere mask of the ta­cit ac­cept­ance of in­hu­man­ity. One should be united with the suf­fer­ing of hu­man be­ings: the smal­lest step to their joys is one to­wards the harden­ing of suf­fer­ing. ]{.calibre3}

### [6]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

[An­ti­thesis]{.calibre22}[. -- For those who do not play along, there ex­ists the danger of con­sid­er­ing them­selves bet­ter than oth­ers and mis­us­ing their cri­tique of so­ci­ety as an ideo­logy for their own private in­terest. While feel­ing their way to­wards mak­ing their own ex­ist­ence into the flick­er­ing pic­ture of the right one, they should re­main aware of its in­sub­stan­ti­al­ity and know how little the pic­ture can re­place the right life. Such con­sid­er­a­tions how­ever con­tra­dict the grav­it­a­tional force of what is bour­geois within them. Those who are at a dis­tance are as en­tangled as those who are act­ively en­gaged; the former have noth­ing over the lat­ter, ex­cept the in­sight into their en­tan­gle­ment and the hap­pi­ness of the tiny free­dom, which lies in the re­cog­ni­tion as such. Their own dis­tance from busi­ness as usual is a lux­ury, solely spun off by that busi­ness as usual. That is why every im­pulse to­wards self-with­drawal bears the marks of what is neg­ated. The cold­ness which it must de­velop is not to be sep­ar­ated from the bour­geois one. In the mon­ad­o­lo­gical prin­ciple, even where it protests, lurks the rul­ing gen­er­al­ity. Proust's ob­ser­va­tion, that the pho­to­graphs of the grand­fath­ers of a duke and a Jew from the en­tre­pren­eur­ial class look so sim­ilar, that no-one thinks of the so­cial rank­ing or­der, strikes at a far more com­pre­hens­ive state of af­fairs \[]{.calibre3}[Sachver­halt]{.calibre22}[\]: all of those dif­fer­ences which com­prised the hap­pi­ness, in­deed the moral sub­stance, of in­di­vidual ex­ist­ence, ob­ject­ively dis­ap­pear be­hind the unity of the epoch. We de­tect the de­cay of edu­ca­tion, and yet our prose, meas­ured against Jacob Grimm or Bachofen, has phras­eo­lo­gies in com­mon with the cul­ture-in­dustry which we did not sus­pect. Moreover we no longer know Greek or Latin like Wolf or Kirch­hoff. We point out the trans­ition of civil­iz­a­tion into anal­pha­bet­ism and ourselves for­get to write let­ters or to read a text of Jean Paul, as it must have been read in his time. We ab­hor the coarsen­ing of life, but the ab­sence of any ob­ject­ively bind­ing com­mon de­cency \[]{.calibre3}[Sitte]{.calibre22}[: mor­als\] com­pels us at every step into modes of con­duct, speech and cal­cu­la­tion which are bar­baric, meas­ured by hu­mane stand­ards, and tact­less, even by the du­bi­ous stand­ards of the good so­ci­ety. With the dis­sol­u­tion of lib­er­al­ism, the au­then­tic bour­geois prin­ciple, that of com­pet­i­tion, was not over­come, but passed over from the ob­jectiv­ity of so­cial pro­cesses into the com­pos­i­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Beschaf­fen­heit]{.calibre22}[: char­ac­ter, con­sti­tu­tion\] of push­ing and shov­ing atoms -- into an­thro­po­logy, as it were. The sub­jug­a­tion of life to the pro­duc­tion-pro­cess de­grad­ingly in­flicts some­thing of that isol­a­tion and loneli­ness on every single per­son, which we are temp­ted to con­sider the mat­ter of our su­per­ior choice. The no­tion that every single per­son con­siders them­selves bet­ter in their par­tic­u­lar in­terest than all oth­ers, is as long-stand­ing a piece of bour­geois ideo­logy as the over­es­tim­a­tion of oth­ers as higher than one­self, just be­cause they are the com­munity of all cus­tom­ers. Since the old bour­geois class has ab­dic­ated, both lead their af­ter­life in the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] of in­tel­lec­tu­als, who are at the same time the last en­emies of the bour­geois, and the last bour­geois. By al­low­ing them­selves to still think at all vis-a-vis the na­ked re­pro­duc­tion of ex­ist­ence, they be­have as the priv­ileged; by leav­ing things in thought, they de­clare the nullity of their priv­ilege. The private ex­ist­ence, which yearns to look like one worthy of hu­man be­ings, sim­ul­tan­eously be­trays the lat­ter, be­cause the sim­il­ar­ity of the gen­eral im­ple­ment­a­tion is with­drawn, which more than ever be­fore re­quires an in­de­pend­ent sens­ib­il­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Bes­in­nung]{.calibre22}[\]. There is no exit from the en­tan­gle­ment. The only re­spons­ible op­tion is to deny one­self the ideo­lo­gical mis­use of one's own ex­ist­ence, and as for the rest, to be­have in private as mod­estly, in­con­spicu­ously and un­pre­ten­tiously as re­quired, not for reas­ons of good up­bring­ing, but be­cause of the shame that when one is in hell, there is still air to breathe.]{.calibre3}

[They, the people. ]{.calibre22}[\[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] -- The cir­cum­stance that in­tel­lec­tu­als mostly deal with other in­tel­lec­tu­als should not mis­lead them into think­ing they are worse than the rest of hu­man­ity. For they en­counter one an­other primar­ily in the most em­bar­rass­ing and de­grad­ing situ­ation of all, that of com­pet­ing sup­plic­ants, and are thereby nearly al­ways com­pelled to show their worst side to each other. Other people, es­pe­cially the simple folk whose vir­tues in­tel­lec­tu­als are wont to praise, usu­ally meet them in the role of someone try­ing to sell them some­thing, who doesn't have to worry about the cus­tomer horn­ing in on their turf. It is easy for the auto mech­anic and the sales-girl at the li­quor store to re­main free of im­pudence: friend­li­ness is in any case man­dated from above. If on the other hand il­lit­er­ates come to in­tel­lec­tu­als in or­der to have let­ters writ­ten, these lat­ter may in­deed make a reas­on­ably good im­pres­sion. But the mo­ment simple folk have to brawl for their share of the so­cial product, they sur­pass any­thing in the canon of envy and hate­ful­ness dis­played by liter­ati or mu­sical dir­ect­ors. The glor­i­fic­a­tion of the splen­did ]{.calibre3}[un­der­dogs ]{.calibre22}[\[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] ends up in glor­i­fy­ing the splen­did sys­tem which made them so. The jus­ti­fi­able feel­ings of guilt of those ex­emp­ted from phys­ical labor ought not be­come an ex­cuse for rural idiocy \[fam­ous phrase used by Marx to de­scribe the stag­na­tion of peas­ant life\]. In­tel­lec­tu­als who write solely about in­tel­lec­tu­als and give them their bad name in the name of that which is au­then­tic \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] only strengthen the lie. A large part of the pre­vail­ing anti-in­tel­lec­tu­al­ism and ir­ra­tion­al­ism, all the way to Hux­ley, is set in mo­tion by the fact that writers com­plain about the mech­an­ism of com­pet­i­tion without them­selves be­ing able to see through the lat­ter, and so fall vic­tim to such. In the field most their own, they have shut out the con­scious­ness of ]{.calibre3}[tat twam asi]{.calibre22}[ \[\"Thou art this," quote from Up­an­ishads\]. That is why they then rush into In­dian temples.]{.calibre3}

[If bad boys should tempt you.]{.calibre22}[ -- There is an]{.calibre3}[ amor in­tel­lec­tualis]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: ab­stract love\] for the kit­chen staff, the tempta­tion for those who work the­or­et­ic­ally or artist­ic­ally, to re­lax the in­tel­lec­tual \[]{.calibre3}[geisti­gen]{.calibre22}[\] claim on one­self, to lower one's niveau, to fol­low all man­ner of plat­it­udes in the mat­ter \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[\] and ex­pres­sion, which one had re­jec­ted as an alert ap­praiser. Since no cat­egor­ies, not even that of cul­tiv­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Bildung]{.calibre22}[: edu­ca­tion\], can be pro­scribed to in­tel­lec­tu­als any­more, and a thou­sand de­mands of hustle and bustle en­danger the con­cen­tra­tion, the ef­fort of pro­du­cing some­thing with a meas­ure of in­teg­rity is so great, that scarcely any­one is still cap­able of it. The pres­sure of con­form­ity, which bur­dens every­one who pro­duces some­thing, fur­thers lowers their de­mands on them­selves. The cen­ter of in­tel­lec­tual \[]{.calibre3}[geisti­gen]{.calibre22}[\] self-dis­cip­line as such is un­der­stood to be dis­in­teg­rat­ing. The ta­boos which com­prised the in­tel­lec­tual \[]{.calibre3}[geisti­gen]{.calibre22}[\] stature of a hu­man be­ing, of­ten sed­i­men­ted ex­per­i­ences and un­ar­tic­u­lated re­cog­ni­tions, dir­ect them­selves con­tinu­ously against one's own im­pulses, which one learned to con­demn, which how­ever are so strong, that only an un­ques­tion­ing and un­ques­tion­able jur­idics \[]{.calibre3}[In­stanz]{.calibre22}[\] can halt them. What ap­plies to the life of the in­stinctual drives, ap­plies no less to the life of the mind: the painter and com­poser, who for­bid them­selves the use of this or that color com­bin­a­tion or chord con­trast as kitschy, the au­thor who finds that a lin­guistic con­fig­ur­a­tion gets on their nerves as banal or pedantic, re­act so force­fully be­cause there are lay­ers within them which are drawn by such. The re­jec­tion of the he­ge­monic over­growth of cul­ture pre­sumes that one has par­ti­cip­ated enough in the lat­ter to feel it in one's fin­ger­tips, as it were, sim­ul­tan­eously draw­ing from this par­ti­cip­a­tion the forces to dis­miss it. These forces, which make their ap­pear­ance as such in in­di­vidual res­ist­ance, are for that reason by no means of a merely in­di­vidual sort. The in­tel­lec­tual con­science, in which they are in­teg­rated, has a so­cial mo­ment so much as the moral su­per­ego. It crys­tal­lizes in the con­cep­tion \[Vor­stel­lung\] of the right so­ci­ety and its cit­izens. If this con­cep­tion is set aside -- and who could still blindly sub­scribe to it -- then the in­tel­lec­tual com­pul­sion to­wards the bot­tom loses its in­hib­i­tions, and all the junk which the bar­baric cul­ture has left be­hind in the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] comes into view: half-edu­ca­tion, lax­ness, clod­dish trust­ful­ness, shod­di­ness. Mostly it is ra­tion­al­ized as hu­man­ity, as the wish to make one­self un­der­stand­able to other hu­man be­ings, as cos­mo­pol­itan re­spons­ib­il­ity. But the sac­ri­fice of in­tel­lec­tual self-dis­cip­line is borne far too eas­ily, to really be­lieve that it is in­deed one. This is drastic­ally evid­ent when ob­serving in­tel­lec­tu­als whose ma­ter­ial situ­ation has changed: as soon as they have con­vinced them­selves even the slight­est bit that they must earn a liv­ing by writ­ing and noth­ing else, they send the same junk into the world, down to the last nu­ances, which in their lusher times they once de­nounced with the ut­most fe­ro­city. En­tirely like formerly wealthy emigres, who can fi­nally be as greedy in for­eign lands as they al­ways wanted to be at home, so do those who are im­pov­er­ished in Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geiste]{.calibre22}[\] march en­thu­si­ast­ic­ally into the hell, which is their heaven. ]{.calibre3}

[Above all one thing, my child]{.calibre22}[. -- What is un­moral about lies does not con­sist of the in­jury to the sac­rosanct truth. No so­ci­ety which forces its com­puls­ory mem­bers to hand them­selves over with lan­guage, in or­der to over­take them that much more quickly, has the right to call on such. It does not be­fit uni­ver­sal un­truth, to in­sist on the par­tic­u­lar truth, while non­ethe­less in­vert­ing the lat­ter straight­away into its op­pos­ite. In spite of this, some­thing re­pel­lent clings to the lie, and though the con­scious­ness of this was in­deed beaten into one with the old whip, this sim­ul­tan­eously said some­thing about the mas­ter of the dun­geon. The mis­take lies in all too much hon­esty. Who­ever lies, is ashamed, be­cause in every lie they must ex­per­i­ence what is de­grad­ing in the ex­ist­ing state of the world, which com­pels them to lie, if they wish to live, while warb­ling "Be ever true and hon­est" \[song scored by Moz­art\] in their ear. Such shame saps the en­ergy of the lies of those who are more subtly or­gan­ized. They do it badly, and only thereby does the lie come to be genu­inely un­moral for oth­ers. It sug­gests the former think the lat­ter are stu­pid, and serves to ex­press dis­respect. Among today's cun­ning prac­ti­tion­ers, the lie has long since lost its hon­est func­tion, of con­ceal­ing some­thing real. No-one be­lieves any­one, every­one is in the loop. Lies are told only when someone wants oth­ers to know they aren't im­port­ant, that the former does not need the lat­ter, and does not care what they think. Today the lie, once a lib­eral means of com­mu­nic­a­tion, has be­come one of the tech­niques of brazen­ness, with whose help every single per­son spreads the ici­ness, in whose shel­ter they thrive. ]{.calibre3}

[Sep­ar­ated-united]{.calibre22}[. -- Mar­riage, whose despic­able par­ody lives on in a time when the basis of the hu­man right of mar­riage has been with­drawn, serves today mostly as a trick of self-pre­ser­va­tion: each of the two con­spir­at­ors de­flects the re­spons­ib­il­ity for any vil­lainy which they might com­mit onto the other, while in truth they ex­ist to­gether opaquely and swamp­ily. The only proper mar­riage would be one, in which both have an in­de­pend­ent life for them­selves, without the fu­sion which rests on an eco­nom­ic­ally com­puls­ory com­munity of in­terest, but which in­stead would in­volve tak­ing mu­tual re­spons­ib­il­ity for each other out of free­dom. Mar­riage as a com­munity of in­terest in­ex­or­ably sig­ni­fies the de­grad­a­tion of the in­ter­ested parties, and what is per­fi­di­ous about the ex­ist­ing state of af­fairs, is that no-one, even if one knew of this, can avoid such de­grad­a­tion. Some­times one might en­ter­tain the thought that it is only those who are eman­cip­ated from the pur­suit of in­terests, that is to say the rich, who re­tain the pos­sib­il­ity of a mar­riage without shame. But this pos­sib­il­ity is en­tirely formal, be­cause those who are priv­ileged are pre­cisely the ones to whom the pur­suit of in­terests has be­come second nature -- oth­er­wise they would not main­tain their priv­ileges. ]{.calibre3}

[Table and bed. -- ]{.calibre22}[As soon as hu­man be­ings di­vorce, even the most kind-hearted, friendly and edu­cated ones, a cloud of dust en­shrouds and daubs everything it touches. It is as if the sphere of in­tim­acy, the in­at­tent­ive trust of the com­mon life is trans­formed into a pois­on­ous sub­stance, once the re­la­tion­ships are broken, in which they res­ted. What is in­tim­ate between hu­man be­ings is com­pas­sion, pa­tience, refuge for per­sonal char­ac­ter­ist­ics. If it is dis­tor­ted, then the mo­ment of weak­ness therein hoves into view, and dur­ing di­vorces such a turn to­wards the out­side is un­avoid­able. Things which were once signs of lov­ing care, pic­tures of re­con­cili­ation, make them­selves sud­denly self-stand­ing as val­ues and show their evil, cold and per­ni­cious side. After sep­ar­a­tions, pro­fess­ors break into the dwell­ings of their wives, in or­der to carry off ob­jects from the desk, and well-ap­poin­ted ladies de­nounce their men for tax-eva­sion. If mar­riage af­forded one of the last pos­sib­il­it­ies of con­struct­ing hu­mane cells in the in­hu­man gen­er­al­ity, then the gen­er­al­ity re­venges it­self in its dis­as­sembly \[Zer­fall\], by tak­ing con­trol of that which was ap­par­ently an ex­cep­tion, the ali­en­ated so­cial or­ders of justice and prop­erty which un­der­lies it and which pours scorn on those who thought them­selves se­cure from it. Pre­cisely that which is safe­guarded turns into the cruel re­quis­ite of be­ing sac­ri­ficed. The more "gen­er­ously" the love­birds ori­gin­ally be­haved with each other, the less they thought of own­er­ship and ob­lig­a­tion, the more hor­rid the hu­mi­li­ation. For it is even in the realm of the jur­idic­ally un­defined, in quar­rel, de­fam­a­tion, in the end­less con­flict of in­terests flour­ishes. Everything shad­owy, on whose ground the in­sti­tu­tion of mar­riage is raised, the bar­baric ac­cess of the man to the prop­erty and labor of the wo­man, the not less bar­baric sexual op­pres­sion, which tenden­tially com­pels the man to take lifelong re­spons­ib­il­ity for someone with whom he once took pleas­ure in sleep­ing with -- this crawls out of the cel­lars and fun­da­ments into the open, when the house is de­mol­ished. Those who once ex­per­i­enced the good gen­er­al­ity in the re­stric­ted be­long­ing to each other, are now com­pelled by the so­ci­ety to con­sider them­selves scoun­drels and to learn, that they are the same as the gen­er­al­ity of un­res­tric­ted nas­ti­ness out­side. The gen­er­al­ity proves it­self in di­vorce as the mark of shame of the par­tic­u­lar, be­cause the par­tic­u­lar, mar­riage, is not cap­able of real­iz­ing the true gen­er­al­ity in this so­ci­ety. ]{.calibre3}

[Inter pares]{.calibre22}[. -- \[Latin: among equals\] In the realm of erotic qual­it­ies, a re­valu­ation seems to be oc­cur­ring. Un­der lib­er­al­ism, well into our day, mar­ried men from high so­ci­ety who were un­sat­is­fied with their strictly brought up and cor­rect spouses ab­solved them­selves in the com­pany of fe­male artists, bo­hemi­ans, sugar ba­bies \[]{.calibre3}[süsse Mädeln]{.calibre22}[: sweet maid­ens\] and cocottes. With the ra­tion­al­iz­a­tion of so­ci­ety this pos­sib­il­ity of un­re­gi­men­ted hap­pi­ness has dis­ap­peared. The cocottes are ex­tinct, the sugar ba­bies prob­ably never ex­is­ted in Anglo-Saxon coun­tries and other lands of tech­nical civil­iz­a­tion, while the fe­male artists and those bo­hemi­ans who ex­ist para­sit­ic­ally in the mass cul­ture are so thor­oughly per­meated with the lat­ter's reason, that those who flee in long­ing to their an­archy, to the free ac­cess­ib­il­ity of their own use-value, are in danger of wak­ing up to the ob­lig­a­tion of en­ga­ging them as as­sist­ants, if not at least re­com­mend­ing them to a film-ex­ec­ut­ive or scriptwriter they know. The only ones who are still cap­able of some­thing like ir­ra­tional love are pre­cisely those ladies who the spouses once fled on ex­cur­sions to Maxim's \[Maxim: fam­ous res­taur­ant in Paris\]. While they are as tire­some to their own hus­bands, due to the lat­ter's fault, as their own moth­ers, they are at least cap­able of grant­ing to oth­ers, what all oth­ers have with­held from them. The long since fri­gid lib­ertine rep­res­ents busi­ness, while the proper and well brought up lady rep­res­ents yearn­ing and un­ro­mantic sexu­al­ity. In the end, the ladies of so­ci­ety garner the honor of their dis­honor, in the mo­ment when there is no more so­ci­ety and no more ladies. ]{.calibre3}

[Aid, as­sist­ance and ad­vice. -- ]{.calibre22}[Every in­tel­lec­tual in emig­ra­tion is, without ex­cep­tion, dam­aged, and if one does not wish to be taught a cruel les­son be­hind the air­tight doors of one's self-es­teem, would do well to re­cog­nize this. One lives in an en­vir­on­ment which ne­ces­sar­ily re­mains in­com­pre­hens­ible, even if one can man­age to find their way among trade union or­gan­iz­a­tions or auto­mobile traffic; one is forever get­ting lost. Between the re­pro­duc­tion of one's own life un­der the mono­poly of mass-cul­ture and ob­ject­ive, re­spons­ible work there lies an ir­re­con­cil­able breach. One's lan­guage has been ex­pro­pri­ated and the his­tor­ical tap­root from which one de­rived their powers of cog­ni­tion has been taken away. The isol­a­tion be­comes worse, the more that closed and polit­ic­ally-dir­ec­ted groups form, sus­pi­cious of their own mem­bers, hos­tile to­wards those branded as the mem­bers of oth­ers. The share of the so­cial sur­plus al­loc­ated to for­eign­ers is never enough to go around and drives them into a hope­less sec­ond­ary com­pet­i­tion amongst them­selves, in the midst of the more gen­eral one. All this leaves tell­tale marks on every in­di­vidual. Who­ever es­capes the shame of be­ing re­duced to the low­est com­mon de­nom­in­ator \[]{.calibre3}[Gleich­schal­tung]{.calibre22}[: "lev­el­ing," no­tori­ous term of Nazi pro­pa­ganda\] bears this ex­cep­tional con­di­tion as their par­tic­u­lar brand: as an il­lus­ory and un­real ex­ist­ence in the life-pro­cess of so­ci­ety. The re­la­tions between those who have been ex­pelled are even more poisoned than between those who are long-stand­ing res­id­ents. All met­rics be­come false, the vis­ion blurs. That which is private as­serts it­self im­prop­erly, hec­tic­ally, vam­pire-like pre­cisely be­cause it no longer really ex­ists and con­vuls­ively wants to prove oth­er­wise. That which is pub­lic is con­signed to the un­spoken oath of fealty on the pub­lic plat­form. The gaze takes on the as­pect of that which is manic and at the same time cold in all grasp­ing, de­vour­ing, com­mand­eer­ing. Noth­ing helps out­side of the stead­fast dia­gnosis of one­self and of oth­ers; the at­tempt, through con­scious­ness, to not so much elude the calam­ity as to de­prive it of its cata­strophic vi­ol­ence, that of blind­ness. One should ex­er­cise the most ex­treme cau­tion in choos­ing one's private circle, in­so­far as one has a choice at all. One should be­ware above all of seek­ing out in­flu­en­tial types from whom "one can ex­pect some­thing." The eye for po­ten­tial ad­vant­ages is the mor­tal en­emy of the con­struc­tion of re­la­tion­ships worthy of hu­man dig­nity; though solid­ar­ity and con­sid­er­a­tion for oth­ers may en­sue from these lat­ter, they can never ori­gin­ate in thoughts of prac­tical deals. No less dan­ger­ous are the mir­ror im­ages of power, the lack­eys, toad­ies and leeches who make them­selves agree­able to those bet­ter off than them­selves, in an ar­chaic man­ner which could only flour­ish in the eco­no­nom­ic­ally ex­tra­ter­rit­ori­al­ized con­di­tions of emig­ra­tion. While they bring their pro­tector small ad­vant­ages, they drag him down as soon as they are ac­cep­ted, an ever-present tempta­tion which is ex­acer­bated by his own help­less­ness while abroad. If the eso­teric ges­ture in Europe was of­ten merely a pre­text for the blind­est self-in­terest, the concept of ]{.calibre3}[aus­ter­ité ]{.calibre22}[\[French: aus­ter­ity\], though far from be­ing com­pletely sea-worthy, re­mains nev­er­the­less the most suit­able life­boat.

[Le bour­geois re­ven­ant]{.calibre22}[. -- \[French: the re­turn­ing bour­geois\] The Fas­cist re­gimes of the first half of the 20th cen­tury have ab­surdly sta­bil­ized an ob­sol­ete eco­nomic form, mul­tiply­ing the ter­ror and misery the lat­ter re­quired for its con­tin­ued pre­ser­va­tion, now that its sense­less­ness is plain as day. Private life how­ever is also marked by this. Along with the reach of ad­min­is­tra­tion, the as­phyxi­at­ing so­cial or­der of the private, the par­tic­u­lar­ism of in­terests, the long since ob­sol­ete form of the fam­ily, the right of prop­erty and its re­flec­tion in the char­ac­ter have all been shored up once more. But with a bad con­science, the barely dis­guised con­scious­ness of un­truth. Whatever was once good and proper in what was bour­geois -- in­de­pend­ence, per­sist­ence, think­ing ahead, con­sid­er­a­tion -- is rot­ten to its in­ner­most core. For while bour­geois forms of ex­ist­ence are dog­gedly pre­served, their eco­nomic pre­requis­ites have fallen away. That which is private has gone over com­pletely into that priva­tion, which it secretly al­ways was, and the stub­born grip on one's own in­terest is in­ter­mingled with the rage that one is no longer cap­able of per­ceiv­ing that things could be dif­fer­ent and bet­ter. The bour­geoisie have lost their naïvété, and for that reason have be­come wholly ob­dur­ate and malevol­ent. The be­ne­vol­ent hand which even now cares for and nour­ishes their little garden as if it had not long ago turned into a "lot" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], but fear­fully holds the un­known in­truder at a dis­tance, is already that which re­fuses to grant the polit­ical refugee asylum. Ob­ject­ively threatened, the power elite and their func­tion­ar­ies be­come sub­ject­ively ut­terly in­hu­man. Thus the class comes into it­self and makes the des­troy­ing will of the course of the world into its own. The bour­geoisie live on like ghosts who threaten cata­strophe. ]{.calibre3}

[Le nou­vel av­are]{.calibre22}[. -- \[French: the new miser\] There are two kinds of greed. One is the ar­chaic kind, the pas­sion which be­grudges noth­ing to one­self and oth­ers, whose physiognomic traits were im­mor­tal­ized by Mo­liere and the­or­ized by Freud as the anal char­ac­ter. It comes to fruition in the miser \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], the beg­gar who secretly owns mil­lions, who is the pur­it­an­ical mask, as it were, of the mys­ter­i­ous ca­liph out of fairy-tales. The miser is re­lated to the col­lector, the manic one or the great lover, like Gob­seck is to Es­ther \[char­ac­ters in Balzac novel\]. Now and then one still runs across them as curi­os­it­ies in the local sec­tion of the news­pa­per. The greedy of today re­gard noth­ing as too ex­pens­ive for them­selves, but everything as too ex­pens­ive for oth­ers. They think in equi­val­en­cies, and their en­tire private life stands un­der the law of giv­ing less than they get back, but al­ways just enough to get back some­thing. Every little fa­vor they dis­pense is marked by an un­spoken, "is that really ne­ces­sary?," "do I really have to?." Their surest sign is the rush to re­venge them­selves for some con­sid­er­a­tion they have re­ceived, in or­der to fore­stall even the slight­est gap in that chain of ex­change-acts, by which one is re­im­bursed. Be­cause everything is ra­tional \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] and busi­ness­like with them, they are -- un­like Harpagon and Scrooge -- neither to be con­victed nor con­ver­ted. Their ami­ab­il­ity is a meas­ure of their im­placab­il­ity. When push comes to shove, they put them­selves ir­re­fut­ably in the right and turn the law into in­justice, while the mad­ness of the shabby skin­flint had the re­deem­ing fea­ture that, ac­cord­ing to the tend­ency, the gold in the cash-box drew thieves to it, in­deed that its pas­sion could be stilled only in sac­ri­fice and loss, just as the erotic de­sire for pos­ses­sion is stilled in self-aban­don­ment. The greedy of today how­ever no longer prac­tice as­ceti­cism as ex­cess, but with cau­tion. They are in­sured. ]{.calibre3}

[On the dia­lectic of tact]{.calibre22}[. -- Goethe, who was quite aware of the threat­en­ing im­possib­il­ity of all hu­man re­la­tion­ships in the dawn­ing in­dus­trial so­ci­ety, sought to rep­res­ent tact in the Wil­helm Meister nov­els as the provid­en­tial in­form­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[rettende Aus­kunft]{.calibre22}[: res­cuing in­form­a­tion, sav­ing ac­com­mod­a­tion\] between ali­en­ated hu­man be­ings. This in­form­a­tion seemed to him as one with re­lin­quish­ment, with re­nun­ci­ation of un­di­min­ished close­ness, pas­sion and un­broken hap­pi­ness. To him, what was hu­mane con­sisted of a self-re­stric­tion, which ad­ju­dic­ated the un­avoid­able course of his­tory -- the in­hu­man­ity of pro­gress, the at­rophy of the sub­ject -- as its own af­fair \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[\]. But what has oc­curred since then makes Goethean re­lin­quish­ment look like ful­fill­ment. Tact and hu­man­ity -- to him the same -- have mean­while gone down pre­cisely the road which, ac­cord­ing to his be­lief, they were to pre­serve us from. For tact has its pre­cise his­tor­ical hour. It is the one in which the bour­geois in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] rid it­self of ab­so­lut­ist com­pul­sion. Free and sol­it­ary, it stood for it­self, while the forms of hier­arch­ical re­spect and de­vo­tion de­veloped by ab­so­lut­ism, di­vested of their eco­nomic found­a­tion and their threat­en­ing force, are still ex­tant enough to make liv­ing to­gether in­side priv­ileged groups bear­able. Such a para­dox­ical open­ing de­but \[]{.calibre3}[Ein­stand]{.calibre22}[\], as it were, of ab­so­lut­ism and lib­er­al­ity can be de­tec­ted every­where from Wil­helm Meister to Beeth­oven's at­ti­tude to­wards the con­ven­tional schemata of mu­sical com­pos­i­tion, and in­deed even in the lo­gic of Kant's sub­ject­ive re­con­struc­tion of ob­ject­ively bind­ing ideas. Beeth­oven's reg­u­lar re­capit­u­la­tions fol­low­ing dy­namic de­vel­op­ments, Kant's de­duc­tion of the schol­astic cat­egor­ies out of the unity of con­scious­ness, are in an em­in­ent sense "tact­ful." The pre­requis­ite of tact is a con­ven­tion which is both frac­tured and yet still ex­tant. This has now ir­re­triev­ably de­cayed, and lives on only in the par­ody of forms, a ca­pri­ciously dreamed up or re­col­lec­ted etiquette for the ig­nor­ant, like the preach­ing of ad­vice colum­nists in news­pa­pers, while the com­mon un­der­stand­ing which might have borne those con­ven­tions in their hu­mane hour has passed over into the blind con­form­ity of auto-own­ers and ra­dio listen­ers. The dy­ing out of the ce­re­mo­nial mo­ment ap­pears at first glance to be­ne­fit tact. The lat­ter is eman­cip­ated from everything het­ero­nom­ous, everything which is rote learn­ing in the bad sense \[]{.calibre3}[schlecht Aus­wendi­gen]{.calibre22}[\], and tact­ful be­ha­vior could only be one which guided it­self ac­cord­ing to the spe­cific con­stitutive fea­tures \[]{.calibre3}[Beschaf­fen­heit]{.calibre22}[\] of each hu­man re­la­tion­ship. Such eman­cip­ated tact how­ever runs into the same dif­fi­culties which every­where plague nom­in­al­ism. Tact meant not simply sub­or­din­a­tion to ce­re­mo­nial con­ven­tion: the lat­ter has been un­stint­ingly iron­ized by all mod­ern hu­man­ists. The achieve­ment of tact was on the con­trary as para­dox­ical as its his­tor­ical po­s­i­tion. It de­man­ded the ac­tu­ally im­possible re­con­cili­ation between the un­au­thentic­ated claim of con­ven­tion and the un­ruly one of the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­vidu­ums]{.calibre22}[\]. Tact could not at all be meas­ured, out­side of that con­ven­tion. This lat­ter rep­res­en­ted, how­ever in­sub­stan­tially, that which is gen­eral, which com­prises the sub­stance of the in­di­vidual claim. Tact is the de­term­in­a­tion of dif­fer­ence. It con­sists of know­ing de­vi­ations. But when, once eman­cip­ated, it con­fronts the in­di­vidu­ated ab­so­lutely, without a gen­er­al­ity from which it could be de­ciphered, it falls short of the in­di­vidu­ated and fi­nally does the lat­ter in­justice. The in­quiry into one's health, when this is no longer re­quired and ex­pec­ted by one's up­bring­ing, turns into nosi­ness or an in­sult, and the si­lence on touchy sub­jects turns into empty in­dif­fer­ence, as soon as no rule gov­erns what one should or should not speak about. In­di­vidu­als thus be­gin to re­act with hos­til­ity to tact, and not without reason: a cer­tain kind of po­lite­ness does not give them the feel­ing of be­ing ad­dressed as hu­man be­ings, but evokes an in­tu­ition of the in­hu­mane con­di­tion in which they find them­selves, and those who are po­lite run the risk of seem­ing im­pol­ite, be­cause they still make use of po­lite­ness like some out­moded prerog­at­ive. Ul­ti­mately, eman­cip­ated, purely in­di­vidual tact turns into a mere lie. What can be marked of it today in the in­di­vidu­ated, is what it spe­cific­ally si­lences -- the ac­tual and still more the po­ten­tial power, which each per­son em­bod­ies. Be­hind the de­mand to con­front the in­di­vidu­ated as such, without any pre­amble, ab­so­lutely as be­fits such, lies an eager su­per­vi­sion, check­ing whether each word ta­citly gives an ac­count of what the ad­dressee, amidst an all-en­com­passing hier­archy hardened in it­self, is say­ing, and which are the ad­dressee's chances. The nom­in­al­ism of tact aids the tri­umph of that which is most gen­eral, the na­ked reach of ad­min­is­tra­tion, even in the most in­tim­ate con­stel­la­tions. The write-off of con­ven­tions as out­moded, use­less and ex­traneous or­na­ments only con­firms the most ex­traneous of all things, a life of im­me­di­ate dom­in­a­tion. That the dis­con­tinu­ation of this ca­ri­ca­ture in school­boy­ish ca­maraderie makes ex­ist­ence even more un­bear­able, as the mock­ery of free­dom, is merely a fur­ther sign of how im­possible it has be­come for hu­man be­ings to live to­gether un­der cur­rent con­di­tions. ]{.calibre3}

[All rights re­served]{.calibre22}[. -- The sig­na­ture of the epoch is that no hu­man be­ing, without any ex­cep­tion, can de­term­ine their life in a some­what trans­par­ent sense, as was earlier pos­sible by gauging mar­ket re­la­tion­ships. In prin­ciple every­one, even the migh­ti­est of all, is an ob­ject. Even the pro­fes­sion of gen­eral af­fords no sure pro­tec­tion any­more. No de­fenses are strin­gent enough in the Fas­cist era to pro­tect headquar­ters from air strikes, and com­mand­ers who be­have with tra­di­tional cau­tion are hanged by Hitler and be­headed by Chi­ang Kai-shek. It fol­lows that any­one at­tempt­ing to some­how make it through -- and even the con­tinu­ation of life has some­thing non­sensical about it, as in dreams wherein one wit­nesses to the end of the world and crawls out af­ter­wards from an un­der­ground cel­lar -- should sim­ul­tan­eously be pre­pared, at any mo­ment, to ex­tin­guish their life. That is the sad truth which emerges from Za­rathus­tra's ex­uber­ant doc­trine of the free death. Free­dom has con­trac­ted into pure neg­at­iv­ity, and what at the time of the ]{.calibre3}[Ju­gend­stil]{.calibre22}[ \[art nou­veau\] was known as dy­ing in beauty, has re­duced it­self to the wish to shorten the end­less de­grad­a­tion of ex­ist­ence as much as the end­less misery of dy­ing, in a world in which there are far worse things to fear than death. -- The ob­ject­ive end of hu­man­ity is only an­other ex­pres­sion for that which is the same. It at­tests to the fact that in­di­vidual per­sons have, as in­di­vidu­als -- as these lat­ter rep­res­ent the spe­cies-be­ing \[]{.calibre3}[Gat­tung­swesen]{.calibre22}[\] of hu­man­ity -- lost the autonomy through which they could have real­ized the spe­cies.]{.calibre3}

[Asylum for the home­less]{.calibre22}[. -- How things are go­ing for private life today is made evid­ent by its arena \[]{.calibre3}[Schauplatz]{.calibre22}[\]. Ac­tu­ally one can no longer dwell any longer. The tra­di­tional dwell­ings, in which we grew up, have taken on the as­pect of some­thing un­bear­able: every mark of com­fort therein is paid for with the be­trayal of cog­ni­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Erken­nt­nis]{.calibre22}[\]; every trace of se­cur­ity, with the stuffy com­munity of in­terest of the fam­ily. The newly func­tion­al­ized ones, con­struc­ted as a ]{.calibre3}[tab­ula rasa]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: blank slate\], are cases made by tech­nical ex­perts for phil­istines, or fact­ory sites which have strayed into the sphere of con­sump­tion, without any re­la­tion to the dweller: they slap the long­ing for an in­de­pend­ent ex­ist­ence, which any­way no longer ex­ists, in the face. With proph­etic mas­ochism, a Ger­man magazine de­creed be­fore Hitler that mod­ern hu­man be­ings want to live close to the ground like an­im­als, ab­ol­ish­ing, along with the bed, the bound­ary between wak­ing and dream­ing. Those who stay overnight are avail­able at all times and un­res­ist­ingly ready for any­thing, sim­ul­tan­eously alert and un­con­scious. Who­ever flees into genu­ine but pur­chased his­tor­ical hous­ing, em­balms them­selves alive. Those who try to evade the re­spons­ib­il­ity for the dwell­ing, by mov­ing into a hotel or into a fur­nished apart­ment, make a canny norm, as it were, out of the com­puls­ory con­di­tions of emig­ra­tion. Things are worst of all, as al­ways, for those who have no choice at all. They live, if not ex­actly in slums, then in bun­ga­lows which to­mor­row may already be thatched huts, trail­ers \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], autos or camps, rest­ing-places un­der the open sky. The house is gone. The de­struc­tion of the European cit­ies, as much as the labor and con­cen­tra­tion camps, are merely the ex­ecut­ors of what the im­man­ent de­vel­op­ment of tech­nics long ago de­cided for houses. These are good only to be thrown away, like old tin cans. The pos­sib­il­ity of dwell­ing is be­ing an­ni­hil­ated by that of the so­cial­istic so­ci­ety, which, hav­ing been missed, sets the bour­geois one in mo­tion to­wards cata­strophe. No in­di­vidual per­son can do any­thing against it. Even those who oc­cupy them­selves with fur­niture designs and in­terior dec­or­a­tion, would already move in the circle of artsy sub­tlety in the man­ner of bib­li­o­philes, how­ever op­posed one might be against art­si­ness in the nar­row sense. From a dis­tance, the dif­fer­ences between the Vi­en­nese work­shops and the Bauhaus are no longer so con­sid­er­able. In the mean­time, the curves of the pure pur­pos­ive form have be­come in­de­pend­ent of their func­tion and pass over into or­na­ments, just like the ba­sic shapes of Cu­bism. The best con­duct in re­gards to all this still ap­pears to be a non­bind­ing, sus­pend­ing one: to lead a private life, so long as the so­cial or­der of so­ci­ety and one's one needs will al­low noth­ing else, but not to put weight on such, as if it were still so­cially sub­stan­tial and in­di­vidu­ally ap­pro­pri­ate. "It is one of my joys, not to be a house-owner," wrote Ni­et­z­sche as early as ]{.calibre3}[The Gay Sci­ence]{.calibre22}[. To this should be ad­ded: eth­ics today means not be­ing at home in one's house. This il­lus­trates some­thing of the dif­fi­cult re­la­tion­ship which in­di­vidual per­sons have ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ their prop­erty, so long as they still own any­thing at all. The trick con­sists of cer­ti­fy­ing and ex­press­ing the fact that private prop­erty no longer be­longs to one per­son, in the sense that the abund­ance of con­sumer goods has be­come po­ten­tially so great, that no in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] has the right to cling to the prin­ciple of their re­stric­tion; that nev­er­the­less one must have prop­erty, if one does not wish to land in that de­pend­ence and priva­tion, which per­petu­ates the blind con­tinu­ation of the re­la­tions of own­er­ship. But the thesis of this para­dox leads to de­struc­tion, a love­less lack of at­ten­tion for things, which ne­ces­sar­ily turns against hu­man be­ings too; and the an­ti­thesis is already, the mo­ment one ex­presses it, an ideo­logy for those who want to keep what is theirs with a bad con­science. There is no right life in the wrong one.]{.calibre3}

[Do not knock]{.calibre22}[. -- Tech­ni­fic­a­tion is mak­ing ges­tures in the mean­time pre­cise and rough -- and thereby hu­man be­ings. They drive all hes­it­a­tion out of ges­tures, all con­sid­er­a­tion, all pro­pri­ety \[]{.calibre3}[Gesit­tung]{.calibre22}[\]. They are sub­jec­ted to the ir­re­con­cil­able -- ahis­tor­ical, as it were -- re­quire­ments of things. Thus one no longer learns to close a door softly, dis­creetly and yet firmly. Those of autos and fri­gidaires have to be slammed, oth­ers have the tend­ency to snap back by them­selves and thus im­pos­ing on those who enter the in­ci­vil­ity of not look­ing be­hind them, of not pro­tect­ing the in­terior of the house which re­ceives them. One can­not ac­count for the new­est hu­man types without an un­der­stand­ing of the things in the en­virons which they con­tinu­ally en­counter, all the way into their most secret in­nerv­a­tions. What does it mean for the sub­ject, that there are no win­dow shut­ters any­more, which can be opened, but only frames to be brusquely shoved, no gentle latches but only handles to be turned, no front lawn, no bar­rier against the street, no wall around the garden? And which auto-driver has not felt the tempta­tion, in the power of the mo­tor, to run over the ver­min of the street -- pass­ersby, chil­dren, bi­cyc­lists? In the move­ments which ma­chines de­mand from their op­er­at­ors, lies already that which is vi­ol­ent, crash­ing, propuls­ively un­ceas­ing in Fas­cist mis­treat­ment. Not the least fault for the dy­ing out of ex­per­i­ence is due to the fact that things as­sume a form un­der the law of their pur­pos­ive­ness which re­strict their in­ter­ac­tion to mere ap­plic­a­tion, without the sur­plus -- were it that of free­dom of be­ha­vior, were it that of the autonomy of the thing -- which might sur­vive as the ker­nel of ex­per­i­ence, be­cause it is not con­sumed by the mo­ment of ac­tion. ]{.calibre3}

[Struwwel­peter]{.calibre22}[. \[Shock-headed Peter, story by Hoff­man\] -- When Hume sought to de­fend epi­stem­o­lo­gical con­tem­pla­tion against his urbane Eng­lish con­tem­por­ar­ies, some­thing ever and anon dis­rep­ut­able to gen­tle­men \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] as "pure philo­sophy," he used the ar­gu­ment: "Ac­cur­acy is, in every case, ad­vant­age­ous to beauty, and just reas­on­ing to del­ic­ate sen­ti­ment." That was it­self prag­matic, and yet it con­tains im­pli­citly and neg­at­ively the en­tire truth con­cern­ing the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] of praxis. In the profit-based eco­nomy, the prac­tical so­cial or­ders \[]{.calibre3}[Ord­nun­gen]{.calibre22}[\] of life, while claim­ing to be­ne­fit hu­man be­ings, cause what is hu­man to wither, and the wider they spread, the more they cut off everything which is tender. For ten­der­ness between hu­man be­ings is noth­ing other than the con­scious­ness of the pos­sib­il­ity of non-pur­pos­ive re­la­tions, which strikes those who are caught up in pur­poses as con­sol­a­tion; the leg­acy of an­cient priv­ileges, which prom­ises a con­di­tion without priv­ilege. The ab­ol­i­tion of priv­ilege by the bour­geois ra­tio ul­ti­mately ab­ol­ishes this prom­ise too. When time is money, it seems the right thing to do to save time, above all one's own, and one ex­cuses such thrifti­ness with all due re­spect for the other. One is straight­for­ward. Every veil which steps between hu­man be­ings con­duct­ing busi­ness is felt to be a dis­turb­ance of the func­tion­ing of the ap­par­atus, in which they are not only ob­ject­ively in­cor­por­ated, but to which they be­long with pride. That they greet each other with the hel­los of tried-and-true in­dif­fer­ence in­stead of doff­ing their hats, that they send each other in­ter­of­fice memos devoid of ad­dresses or sig­na­tures in­stead of let­ters, are the en­demic symp­toms of the sick­ness of con­tact. Ali­en­a­tion mani­fests it­self in hu­man be­ings pre­cisely in the fact that dis­tances fall away. For only so long as they are not over­whelmed with giv­ing and tak­ing, dis­cus­sion and con­clu­sion, ac­cess and func­tion, would enough space re­main between them for that fine mesh of threads, which con­nects them to each other, and whereby that which is ex­ternal \[]{.calibre3}[Aus­wendige]{.calibre22}[\] truly crys­tal­lizes as what is as­sim­il­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­wendiges]{.calibre22}[\]. Re­ac­tion­ar­ies such as the fol­low­ers of C.G. Jung have no­ticed some­thing of this. "It is a typ­ical fea­ture," goes an ]{.calibre3}[Eranos]{.calibre22}[ es­say by G. R. Hey­ers, "of those not fully formed by civil­iz­a­tion, that a theme may not be im­me­di­ately dealt with, in­deed may not even be men­tioned; on the con­trary the con­ver­sa­tion must move in spir­als by it­self to­wards its ac­tual ob­ject." In­stead, the shortest con­nec­tion between two people is now the straight line, as if they were points. Just as the walls of houses are nowadays poured out of ce­ment molds, so too has the so­cial mor­tar between hu­man be­ings been re­placed by the pres­sure, which holds them to­gether. What is dif­fer­ent, is no longer even un­der­stood, but ap­pears, if not quite as the Vi­en­nese culin­ary spe­cialty with a tinge of some­thing head­waiterly, then as child­ish trust­ful­ness or im­per­miss­ible close­ness. In the form of the off­hand com­ments con­cern­ing the health and dis­pos­i­tion of the spouse, which pre­cede the busi­ness lunch, the op­pos­i­tion to the so­cial or­der of pur­poses has it­self been seized by such, ad­duced into the lat­ter. The ta­boo against talk­ing shop and the in­ca­pa­city to talk to each other are in truth the same thing. Be­cause everything is busi­ness, it may not be named as such, rather like the rope in the house of someone who has hanged them­selves. Be­hind the pseudo-demo­cratic de­moli­tion of for­mu­laic modes \[]{.calibre3}[Formel­wesen]{.calibre22}[\], ar­chaic court­li­ness, and use­less con­ver­sa­tions which are not un­fairly sus­pec­ted of be­ing gos­sip, be­hind the ap­par­ent cla­ri­fic­a­tion and trans­par­ency of hu­man re­la­tions, which no longer per­mits any­thing which is un­defined, stands the ar­rival of open bar­bar­ity. The dir­ect an­swer, which tells oth­ers the facts of the mat­ter to their face, without di­gres­sions, hes­it­a­tions, or re­flec­tions, already has the form and sound of the com­mands, which un­der Fas­cism the dumb is­sued to the si­lent. The mat­ter-of-fact­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Sach­lich­keit]{.calibre22}[\] between hu­man be­ings which clears away the ideo­lo­gical or­na­ment­a­tion between them, has it­self already be­come an ideo­logy of those who wish to treat hu­man be­ings as things.]{.calibre3}

[No ex­changes al­lowed]{.calibre22}[. -- Hu­man be­ings are for­get­ting how to give gifts. Vi­ol­a­tions of the ex­change-prin­ciple have some­thing mad and un­be­liev­able about them; here and there even chil­dren size up the gift-giver mis­trust­fully, as if the gift were only a trick, to sell them a brush or soap. For that, one doles out char­ity \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], ad­min­istered well-be­ing, which pa­pers over the vis­ible wounds of so­ci­ety in co­ordin­ated fash­ion. In its or­gan­ized bustle, the hu­man im­pulse no longer has any room, in­deed even dona­tions to the needy are ne­ces­sar­ily con­nec­ted with the hu­mi­li­ation of de­liv­ery, the cor­rect meas­ure, in short through the treat­ment of the re­cip­i­ent as an ob­ject. Even private gift-giv­ing has de­gen­er­ated into a so­cial func­tion, which one car­ries out with a re­luct­ant will, with tight con­trol over the pock­et­book, a skep­tical eval­u­ation of the other and with the most min­imal ef­fort. Real gift-giv­ing had its hap­pi­ness in ima­gin­ing the hap­pi­ness of the re­ceiver. It meant choos­ing, spend­ing time, go­ing out of one's way, think­ing of the other as a sub­ject: the op­pos­ite of for­get­ful­ness. Hardly any­one is still cap­able of this. In the best of cases, they give what they them­selves would have wished for, only a few shades of nu­ance worse. The de­cline of gift-giv­ing is mirrored in the em­bar­rass­ing in­ven­tion of gift art­icles, which are based on the fact that one no longer knows what one should give, be­cause one no longer really wants to. These goods are as re­la­tion­less as their pur­chasers. They were shelf warm­ers \[]{.calibre3}[Lad­en­hueter]{.calibre22}[\] from the first day. Like­wise with the right to ex­change the gift, which sig­ni­fies to the re­ceiver: here's your stuff, do what you want with it, if you don't like it, I don't care, get some­thing else if you want. In con­trast to the em­bar­rass­ment of the usual gifts, their pure fun­gib­il­ity still rep­res­ents some­thing which is more hu­mane, be­cause they at least per­mit the re­ceiver to give them­selves some­thing, which is to be sure sim­ul­tan­eously in ab­so­lute con­tra­dic­tion to the gift.]{.calibre3}

[In re­la­tion of the greater abund­ance of goods, which are avail­able even to the poor, the de­cline of gift-giv­ing may ap­pear un­im­port­ant, and con­sid­er­a­tions on such as sen­ti­mental. How­ever, even if it be­came su­per­flu­ous in a con­di­tion of su­per­fluity -- and this is a lie, privately as well as so­cially, for there is no-one today whose ima­gin­a­tion could not find ex­actly what would make them thor­oughly happy -- those who no longer gave would still be in need of gift-giv­ing. In them wither away those ir­re­place­able ca­pa­cit­ies which can­not bloom in the isol­ated cell of pure in­ter­i­or­ity, but only in con­tact with the warmth of things. Cold­ness en­vel­ops everything which they do, the friendly word which re­mains un­spoken, the con­sid­er­a­tion which re­mains un­prac­ticed. Such ici­ness re­coils back on those from which it spread. All re­la­tions which are not dis­tor­ted, in­deed per­haps what is re­con­cili­at­ory in or­ganic life it­self, is a gift. Those who be­come in­cap­able of this through the lo­gic of strin­gency \[]{.calibre3}[Kon­sequenz]{.calibre22}[: con­sequence, co­rol­lary\], make them­selves into things and freeze.]{.calibre3}

[Baby with the bathwa­ter. -- ]{.calibre22}[One of the cent­ral mo­tifs of cul­tural cri­tique since time im­me­morial is that of the lie: that cul­ture pro­duces the il­lu­sion of a so­ci­ety worthy of hu­man be­ings, which does not ex­ist; that it con­ceals the ma­ter­ial con­di­tions on which everything hu­man is con­struc­ted; and that by seek­ing to con­sole and as­suage, it ends up pre­serving the bad eco­nomic de­term­in­acy of every­day ex­ist­ence. This is the no­tion of cul­ture as ideo­logy, which at first glance both the bour­geois doc­trine of vi­ol­ence and its op­pon­ent, Ni­et­z­sche and Marx, seem to have in com­mon. But pre­cisely this no­tion, like all hand-wringing against lies, has a sus­pi­cious tend­ency to it­self be­come an ideo­logy. This is evid­ent in the realm of the private. Thoughts con­cern­ing money and the con­flicts at­tend­ant on such in­vari­ably reach deep into the most heart­felt erotic, sub­lime and spir­itual \[]{.calibre3}[geistige]{.calibre22}[: spir­itual, in­tel­lec­tual\] re­la­tion­ships. The cul­tural critic could de­mand, fol­low­ing the lo­gic of con­sequence and the pathos of the truth, that all re­la­tions ought to be re­duced to their ma­ter­ial ori­gins, without any con­sid­er­a­tion and dir­ectly ac­cord­ing to the in­terests of the par­ti­cipants. After all, mean­ing is never free from its gen­esis, and it would be easy to show the trace of in­justice, sen­ti­ment­al­ity, and frus­trated and there­fore doubly pois­on­ous in­terest in everything which over­lays or me­di­ates that which is ma­ter­ial. Yet if one wished to act rad­ic­ally on this in­sight, one would up­root all that is true along with everything un­true, everything which, how­ever power­lessly, dares to try to es­cape the demesne of uni­ver­sal praxis, in­deed all the chi­mer­ical an­ti­cip­a­tions of a wor­thier state of af­fairs, and would thereby fall back into that bar­bar­ism which one re­proaches cul­ture for me­di­at­ing. In the bour­geois cul­tural crit­ics after Ni­et­z­sche this un­ex­pec­ted re­versal was al­ways evid­ent; Spen­gler en­thu­si­ast­ic­ally en­dorsed it. But Marx­ists are not im­mune to this either. Once cured of the so­cial demo­cratic be­lief in cul­tural pro­gress and con­fron­ted with the rising tide of bar­bar­ism, they face the con­stant tempta­tion to ad­voc­ate such as the "ob­ject­ive tend­ency" and, in an act of des­per­a­tion, to ex­pect sal­va­tion from the mor­tal en­emy who, in the guise of the "an­ti­thesis," is sup­posed to blindly and mys­ter­i­ously ar­range a happy end­ing. In­vok­ing the ma­ter­ial ele­ment against the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] as a lie bears a kind of du­bi­ous af­fin­ity with polit­ical eco­nomy, which one sub­jects to im­man­ent cri­tique, com­par­able to the com­pli­city between the po­lice and the un­der­world. Since the ban­ish­ment of uto­pia and the unity of praxis and the­ory was made com­puls­ory, one has be­come all too prac­tical. The fear of the power­less­ness of the­ory yields the pre­text of de­clar­ing fealty to the almighty pro­duc­tion-pro­cess and thereby fully con­cedes the power­less­ness of the­ory. Traces of malice are not en­tirely for­eign to au­then­tic Marx­ist dis­course, and today there is a grow­ing re­semb­lance between the spirit of busi­ness and the sober, jur­idical cri­tique, between vul­gar ma­ter­i­al­ism and the other kind, in which it be­comes in­creas­ingly dif­fi­cult to prop­erly sep­ar­ate sub­ject and ob­ject. -- To identify cul­ture solely with lies is most dis­astrous at the mo­ment when it really be­comes ab­sorbed by such, and this iden­ti­fic­a­tion is en­thu­si­ast­ic­ally lauded in or­der to com­prom­ise every thought which res­ists such. If one calls ma­ter­ial real­ity the world of ex­change-value, and cul­ture, that which re­fuses to ac­cept the dom­in­a­tion of such, this re­fusal is in­deed il­lus­ory so long as the ex­ist­ent con­tin­ues to ex­ist. But since the free and equal ex­change is it­self a lie, whatever denies it stands at the same time for the truth: lies ac­cord­ingly be­come a cor­rect­ive on the lie of the world of com­mod­it­ies, and con­sequently de­nounce such. That cul­ture has hitherto failed is not a grounds for de­mand­ing its fail­ure, by strew­ing the store of milled flour on spilled beer like Kath­er­li­es­chen \[ref­er­ence to fairy-tale\]. Hu­man be­ings who be­long to­gether should neither be si­lent about their ma­ter­ial in­terests nor re­duce them­selves to their low­est com­mon de­nom­in­ator, but should re­flect­ively grasp their re­la­tion­ship and thereby move bey­ond such. ]{.calibre3}

[Plurale tantum]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: only in the plural\] -- If so­ci­ety is truly one of rack­ets, as a con­tem­por­ary the­ory teaches, then its truest model is pre­cisely the op­pos­ite of the col­lect­ive, namely the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] as monad. By pur­su­ing the ab­so­lutely par­tic­u­lar in­terest of every single in­di­vidual, the es­sen­tial nature \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\] of the col­lect­ive can be most pre­cisely stud­ied, and it re­quires no great leap to de­cipher the or­gan­iz­a­tion of the vari­ous con­flict­ing drives un­der the primacy of the real­ity-ori­ented ego from the be­gin­ning as an in­nerv­ated band of rob­bers with a leader, fol­low­ers, ce­re­mon­ies, oaths, oath-break­ing, in­terest-con­flicts, in­trigues and all the other paraphernalia. One need only ob­serve out­breaks, in which the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] re­acts en­er­get­ic­ally against the en­vir­on­ment, as for ex­ample rage. The en­raged al­ways seem to be their own gang-lead­ers, whose un­con­scious has re­ceived the com­mand to strike mer­ci­lessly, and from whose eyes gleams the sat­is­fac­tion of speak­ing for the many, which they in­deed are. The more someone is taken up with their ag­gres­sion, the more per­fectly they rep­res­ent the re­press­ing prin­ciple of so­ci­ety. In this sense, per­haps more than in any other, the rule ap­plies: that which is most in­di­vidual would be the most gen­eral.]{.calibre3}

[Tough baby]{.calibre22}[ \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] -- A cer­tain ges­ture of man­li­ness, be it one's own, be it that of an­other, de­serves mis­trust. It ex­presses in­de­pend­ence, surety of the power of com­mand, the si­lent con­spir­acy of all men with each other. Earlier one anxiously called it, awe-struck, the whims of lords, today it is demo­crat­ized and is played by film her­oes for the be­ne­fit of the lowli­est bank em­ployee. The ar­che­type for this is the good look­ing man in a smoking jacket, who enters his bach­elor's pad alone one late even­ing, turns on the in­dir­ect light­ing, and pours a whisky-soda: the care­fully re­cor­ded fizz­ing of the min­eral wa­ter says what the ar­rog­ant mouth does not; that he des­pises whatever does not smell of smoke, leather and shav­ing cream -- above all, wo­men, and for that very reason they swarm all over him. For him, the pin­nacle of hu­man re­la­tions is the club, the site of a re­spect foun­ded on a con­sid­er­ate in­con­sid­er­ate­ness. The joys of such men, or on the con­trary of their mod­els, which hardly any­one alive really matches, for hu­man be­ings are al­ways bet­ter than their cul­ture, have al­to­gether some­thing of the lat­ent act of vi­ol­ence. By all ap­pear­ances, this is threatened to oth­ers, though he has long since had no need to do so, sprawled on his easy chair. In truth it is past vi­ol­ence against him­self. If all pleas­ure sub­lates earlier dis­pleas­ure \[Un­lust\], then here dis­pleas­ure is raised -- as pride in bear­ing it -- un­me­di­ated, un­trans­formed, ste­reo­typ­ic­ally into pleas­ure: un­like wine, every glass of whis­key, every puff on the ci­gar still re­calls the re­luct­ance, which it must have cost the or­gan­ism, to ac­cus­tom it­self to such power­ful stim­uli. Ac­cord­ing to their own con­sti­tu­tion, the he-men would thus be what they are usu­ally presen­ted as in film scripts, mas­ochists. The lie is con­cealed in their sad­ism, and it is as li­ars that they truly be­come sad­ists, agents of re­pres­sion. That lie is noth­ing other than repressed ho­mo­sexu­al­ity, which emerges as the only ap­proved form of what is het­ero­sexual. In Ox­ford one can dif­fer­en­ti­ate between two kinds of stu­dents: the "tough guys" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] and the in­tel­lec­tu­als; the lat­ter are equated al­most without fur­ther ado to those who are ef­fem­in­ate. There is a great deal of evid­ence that the rul­ing class po­lar­izes it­self ac­cord­ing to these ex­tremes on the road to dic­tat­or­ship. Such dis­in­teg­ra­tion is the secret of in­teg­ra­tion, of hap­pi­ness of unity in the ab­sence of hap­pi­ness. In the end the "tough guys" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] are the ones who are really ef­fem­in­ate, who re­quire the weak­lings as their vic­tims, in or­der not to ad­mit that they are like them. To­tal­ity and ho­mo­sexu­al­ity be­long to­gether. While the sub­ject falls apart, it neg­ates everything which is not of its own kind. The op­pos­ites of the strong man and the com­pli­ant youth fuse into a so­cial or­der, which un­re­servedly as­serts the mas­cu­line prin­ciple of dom­in­a­tion. By mak­ing every­one, without ex­cep­tion -- even pre­sumed sub­jects -- into its ob­jects, it re­coils into total passiv­ity, vir­tu­ally into what is fem­in­ine. ]{.calibre3}

All were in the lan­guage of the gift-givers: none of them thought to ask whether I could ac­tu­ally read them. The pe­cu­liar in­ac­cess­ib­il­ity of the books, which sprang at me with pic­tures, huge titles and vign­ettes, without giv­ing me any chance to de­cipher the text, led me to be­lieve that these weren't really books at all, but rather ad­vert­ise­ments, per­haps for ma­chines, like the ones my uncle pro­duced in his Lon­don fact­ory. Since I have come to live in Anglo-Saxon coun­tries and to speak Eng­lish, this con­scious­ness has not dimmed but rather strengthened. There is a girl's song from Brahm, based on a poem by Heyse, which goes: "Oh heart's woe, you etern­ity / only self-other is bliss for me." In the most pop­u­lar Amer­ican ver­sion, this is rendered as: "O misery, etern­ity! / But two in one were ec­stasy."

Be­cause they know no traces of shoes or wheels, no gentle foot­paths along their edge as a trans­ition to the ve­get­a­tion, no side-paths into the val­ley be­low, they lack that which is mild, softened, roun­ded in things, on which hands or their im­me­di­ate tools have worked. It is as if no-one had combed the land­scape's hair. It is dis­con­sol­ate and in­con­sol­able. This cor­res­ponds to the man­ner of its per­cep­tion.

Groups of hu­man be­ings were solid­ar­istic be­cause they com­mit­ted their lives to­gether, and be­cause their own lives were, in view of the tan­gible pos­sib­il­ity, not the most im­port­ant thing, so that they were pre­pared to sac­ri­fice them­selves for each other without the ab­stract ob­ses­sion of the idea but also without in­di­vidual hope.

Mean­while how­ever solid­ar­ity has passed over into the trust that the Party has a thou­sand eyes, into en­list­ment into uni­formed work­ers' bat­talions which are as­sumed to be stronger, in swim­ming along with the cur­rent of world-his­tory. Whatever is to be tem­por­ar­ily gained in se­cur­ity from this, is paid for with per­man­ent fear, sy­co­phancy, mu­tual backscratch­ing and vent­ri­lo­quy: the en­er­gies which one could have used to feel out the weak­ness of the en­emy are used to an­ti­cip­ate the moods of one's own lead­ers, be­fore whom one trembles deep down more than be­fore the old en­emy, in­tu­it­ing that in the end the lead­ers both here and there will come to an ac­com­mod­a­tion on the backs of those they have in­teg­rated.

It is ob­served time and again that those re­cruited young and in­no­cent into rad­ical groups de­fect the mo­ment they be­come aware of the force of tra­di­tion. One has to have this lat­ter in one­self in or­der to hate it prop­erly. That it is the snobs rather than the pro­let­ari­ans who have a taste for av­ant-garde aes­thetic move­ments sheds light on polit­ics, too. Late­comers and new­comers alike have a wor­ri­some af­fin­ity for pos­it­iv­ism, from the de­votees of Carnap in In­dia to the bold de­fend­ers of the Ger­man mas­ters Mat­thias Grüne­wald and Hein­rich Schütz. It would be poor psy­cho­logy to pre­sume that what one is ex­cluded from arouses only hate and re­sent­ment; it also awakens a pos­sess­ive, im­pa­tient sort of love, and those who re­press­ive cul­ture keeps at a dis­tance can turn, eas­ily enough, into the lat­ter's most nar­row-minded par­tis­ans. This res­on­ates even in the over­com­pens­at­ing High Ger­man of the worker who as a so­cial­ist wants "to learn a bit," to take part in the so-called cul­tural her­it­age, and the banal­ity of the Bebels con­sists not so much in their for­eignness to cul­ture than in the en­thu­si­asm with which they pre­sume it as a fact, identi­fy­ing with it and in­deed thereby in­vert­ing its mean­ing. So­cial­ism is in gen­eral as little im­mune from this trans­form­a­tion as the the­or­et­ical slip­page into pos­it­iv­ism. It can hap­pen eas­ily enough that in the Far East Marx takes the place va­cated by Driesch and Rick­ert. At times it is to be feared that the in­ter­re­la­tion­ship of the non-Oc­ci­dental peoples in the ant­ag­on­isms of in­dus­trial so­ci­ety, in it­self long over­due, will primar­ily be­ne­fit the ra­tional in­crease of pro­duc­tion and trans­port and the mod­est rais­ing of liv­ing stand­ards, rather than those to be eman­cip­ated.

[Like the Thirty Years' War, so too does this war -- whose be­gin­ning no-one will be able to re­mem­ber any­more, once it comes to an end -- dis­in­teg­rates into dis­con­tinu­ous field cam­paigns, sep­ar­ated by blank pauses; the Pol­ish cam­paign, the Nor­we­gian, the French, the Rus­sian, the Tunisian, the Nor­mandy In­va­sion. Its rhythm, the al­tern­a­tion of spas­modic ac­tion and com­plete stand­still, due to a lack of geo­graph­ic­ally ac­cess­ible en­emies, has it­self some­thing mech­an­ical about it, which char­ac­ter­ized the means of war in the par­tic­u­lar and which has very likely evoked once more the prelib­eral form of the cam­paign.

The sheer in­com­men­sur­ab­il­ity of the body to the war of at­tri­tion the pre­vi­ous time around \[i.e. WW I\] already made au­then­tic ex­per­i­ence im­possible. No-one could have talked about it the way the battles of the ar­til­lery-gen­eral Na­po­leon Bona­parte were re­coun­ted. The long in­ter­val between war mem­oirs and the armistice is not an ac­ci­dent: it test­i­fies to the la­bor­i­ous re­con­struc­tion of memory, which re­mains con­joined to some­thing power­less and even in­au­thentic in all those books, re­gard­less of whatever hor­rors the writer wit­nessed. WW II how­ever is as com­pletely devoid of ex­per­i­ence as a ma­chine is to the move­ments of a body, which it re­sembles only in peri­ods of ill­ness.

Every­where, with each ex­plo­sion, it has broken through the pro­tect­ive shield in which per­sonal ex­per­i­ence formed, the dur­a­tion between the heal­ing for­get­ting and the heal­ing memory. Life has trans­formed it­self into a time­less suc­ces­sion of shocks, between which gape holes, para­lyzed in­ter­me­di­ary spaces. Noth­ing how­ever is per­haps more cata­strophic for the fu­ture than the fact that soon lit­er­ally no-one will be able to think of this, that every trauma, every un­pro­cessed shock of that which re­curs, is a fer­ment of com­ing de­struc­tion. -- Karl Kraus was right to call his play ]{.calibre3}[The Last Days of Hu­man­ity]{.calibre22}[.

As long as like fol­lows like, the cata­strophe per­petu­ates it­self. One need only con­sider re­tri­bu­tion for the murdered.

What Hitler ex­tirp­ated in art and cul­ture had long led an apo­chryphal and cut-off ex­ist­ence, whose last hid­ing-spaces were swept away by Fas­cism. Who­ever did not play along, had to go into in­ner emig­ra­tion years be­fore the out­break of the Third Reich: at the very latest, since the sta­bil­iz­a­tion of the Ger­man cur­rency, which co­in­cided with the end of Ex­pres­sion­ism, Ger­man cul­ture had sta­bil­ized it­self in the spirit of the Ber­lin il­lus­trated magazines, which con­ceded little to the strength through joy \[no­tori­ous Nazi slo­gan\], na­tional auto high­ways, and up­beat ex­hib­i­tion-clas­si­cism of the Nazis. In its broad­est meas­ure, Ger­man cul­ture pined for its Hitler pre­cisely where it was most lib­eral, and it would be an in­justice to re­proach the ed­it­ors of Moss and Ull­stein or the re­or­gan­izers of the ]{.calibre3}[Frank­furter News]{.calibre22}[ for fol­low­ing the sens­ib­il­it­ies of the times. They were already this way, and their line of least res­ist­ance to the in­tel­lec­tual goods they pro­duced meshes seam­lessly into the line of least res­ist­ance to polit­ical rule, whose ideo­lo­gical meth­ods in­cluded, in the Fuehrer's own words, above all com­pre­hens­ib­il­ity for the most stu­pid. This has led to a cata­strophic con­fu­sion. Hitler has ex­tirp­ated cul­ture, Hitler drove Mr. Louis into ex­ile, there­fore Mr. Louis is cul­ture. And so he is. A glance at the lit­er­ary pro­duc­tion of those emig­rants who, by dint of dis­cip­line and a strict com­part­ment­al­iz­a­tion of spheres of in­flu­ence, have come to rep­res­ent the Ger­man Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], show just what one can ex­pect from the happy re­build­ing pro­cess: the in­tro­duc­tion of Broad­way meth­ods on the Kür­fursten­damm \[main road of Ber­lin\], which by the 1920s was dis­tin­guish­able from the former only by its lesser means, not bet­ter ends. Who­ever in­tends to do some­thing against cul­tural fas­cism, must come to grips with Wei­mar, the "Bombs on Monte Carlo" and the Press Ball, if one does not wish to dis­cover that, in the end, am­bigu­ous fig­ures such as Fal­lada un­der Hitler said more than the spot­less Ger­man per­son­al­it­ies, who suc­ceeded in trans­fer­ring their prestige.]{.calibre3}

[The health unto death]{.calibre22}[. -- If some­thing like a psy­cho­ana­lysis of today's pro­to­typ­ical cul­ture were pos­sible; if the ab­so­lute he­ge­mony of the eco­nomy did not mock every at­tempt at ex­plic­at­ing con­di­tions by the psychic life of their vic­tims; and if the psy­cho­ana­lysts them­selves had not long ago sworn fealty to those con­di­tions -- then such an in­vest­ig­a­tion would have to show that con­tem­por­ary sick­ness ex­ists pre­cisely in what is nor­mal. The li­bid­inal achieve­ments which are re­quired of the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\], who be­haves in a man­ner sound in body and mind, are such that they can be per­fec­ted only by vir­tue of the deep­est mu­til­a­tion, of an in­nerv­a­tion of cas­tra­tion by the "ex­tro­verts" \[in Eng­lish in the ori­ginal\]; by com­par­ison, the old task of iden­ti­fic­a­tion with the father was in­deed the child's play which it was re­hearsed as. The "reg­u­lar guy" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], the "pop­u­lar girl" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] must repress not only their de­sires and cog­ni­tions, but also all of the symp­toms gen­er­ated by re­pres­sion in bour­geois times. Just as the old in­justices are left un­changed by the gen­er­ous mass dis­play of light, air and hy­giene, but are con­cealed pre­cisely by the gleam­ing \[]{.calibre3}[blinkende]{.calibre22}[\] trans­par­ency of ra­tion­al­ized en­ter­prise, so too has the most in­tern­al­ized \[]{.calibre3}[in­wendige]{.calibre22}[\] health of the epoch cut off the flight into sick­ness, without chan­ging the slight­est bit of the lat­ter's eti­ology. The darkened exits have been wiped out as an em­bar­rass­ing waste of space and dis­placed into the bath­room. This con­firms the sus­pi­cion which psy­cho­ana­lysis long har­bored, be­fore it it­self turned into a piece of hy­giene. Where the light is bright­est, is where the fecal secretly rules. The verse: "Misery re­mains. As it ever was. / You can't com­pletely up­root its laws / But you make it an in­vis­ible cause," ap­plies in the house­hold of the psyche even more than where the abund­ance of goods ob­scures, for the time be­ing, con­stantly in­creas­ing ma­ter­ial dif­fer­ences. To this day, no sci­ence would suf­fice to plumb the depths of the hell in which those de­form­a­tions are pro­duced, which sur­face later as cheer­ful­ness, de­cis­ive­ness, so­ci­ab­il­ity, as suc­cess­ful ad­apt­a­tion to what is un­avoid­able and as un­var­nished com­mon sense. There is reason to pre­sume that these de­rive from still earlier phases of child­hood de­vel­op­ment than the ori­gin of neur­oses: if these lat­ter are the res­ult of a con­flict in which the drive is beaten down, then the former be­speaks a con­di­tion which is as nor­mal as the dam­aged so­ci­ety which it re­sembles, that of a pre­his­tor­ical as­sault, as it were, which smashes the forces of the psyche be­fore a con­flict can even oc­cur, and the later state of un­con­flic­ted­ness re­flects the pre­de­ter­mined so­cial be­ing, the a pri­ori tri­umph of the col­lect­ive in­stance, not heal­ing through cog­ni­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Erkennen]{.calibre22}[: re­cog­niz­ing, un­der­stand­ing\]. The iron nerves and calm un­der fire which are the cru­cial pre­requis­ites for ap­plic­ants of highly paid po­s­i­tions, are the pic­ture of the as­phyxi­ated si­lence, which the em­ploy­ers of the hu­man re­sources man­ager later im­pose polit­ic­ally. The sick­ness of the healthy is solely to be dia­gnosed ob­ject­ively, in the dis­pro­por­tion between the ra­tional way they lead their lives and the pos­sibly reas­on­able de­term­in­a­tion of their lives. But the trace of the sick­ness be­trays it­self non­ethe­less: they look as if their skin were prin­ted with a rash in reg­u­lar pat­terns, as if in mim­icry of what is in­or­ganic. It re­quires little to ima­gine those bent on prov­ing their quick­sil­ver live­li­ness and over­power­ing en­ergy as pre­pared corpses, to whom the news of their not quite suc­cess­ful de­mise has been with­held for reas­ons of pop­u­la­tion policy. At the root of rul­ing health lies death. All of its move­ments re­semble the re­flex-move­ments of be­ings, whose hearts have stopped. Hardly ever does a fur­rowed brow -- testi­mony to some fear­some and long-for­got­ten ef­fort -- or a mo­ment of pathic stu­pid­ity in the middle of fixed lo­gic, or in­deed a help­less ges­ture, pre­serve the dis­turb­ing traces of dis­ap­peared life. For the so­cially des­ig­nated sac­ri­fice is so uni­ver­sal, that it mani­fests it­self in the so­ci­ety as a whole and not in the in­di­vidual per­son. It has taken over the sick­ness of all in­di­vidu­als, as it were, and in it, in the bottled-up mad­ness of Fas­cist ac­tions and in all its in­nu­mer­able pre­curs­ors and me­di­ations, the sub­ject­ive cata­strophe in­scribed in the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] is in­teg­rated with the vis­ibly ob­ject­ive one. There is hardly con­sol­a­tion in the thought that the sick­ness of what is nor­mal is not ne­ces­sar­ily the op­pos­ite of the health of those who are sick, but rather that the lat­ter only rep­res­ents, for the most part, the schemata of the same cata­strophe in a dif­fer­ent form.]{.calibre3}

[This side of the pleas­ure-prin­ciple.]{.calibre22}[ -- The re­press­ive traits in Freud have noth­ing to do with that lack of be­ne­vol­ence \[]{.calibre3}[Güte]{.calibre22}[\], which the ever-in­dus­tri­ous re­vi­sion­ists refer to in the strict sexual the­ory. Those who are be­ne­vol­ent by pro­fes­sion fab­u­late profits on the basis of close­ness and im­me­di­acy, pre­cisely where no-one knows any­thing about any­one else. They be­tray their vic­tims by af­firm­ing, in the weak­ness of the lat­ter, the course of the world which made them so, and in­flict just as much in­justice on the lat­ter, as the truth they omit. If Freud lacked such be­ne­vol­ence, then on this score at least he would be in the com­pany of crit­ics of polit­ical eco­nomy \[i.e. Marx\], which is bet­ter than that of Tagore and Wer­fel. On the con­trary, what is fatal is that, in op­pos­i­tion to bour­geois ideo­logy, he ma­ter­i­al­ist­ic­ally pur­sued con­scious be­ha­vior into the basis of its un­con­scious ground­ing in the drives, yet sim­ul­tan­eously ac­cords with the bour­geois con­tempt for the drives, which is it­self the product of pre­cisely those ra­tion­al­iz­a­tions, which he de­mol­ishes. He par­takes, in the words of the ]{.calibre3}[In­tro­duct­ory Lec­tures]{.calibre22}[, of "the gen­eral es­tim­a­tion\... that so­cial goals stand higher than fun­da­ment­ally, self-servingly sexual ones." As an ex­pert psy­cho­lo­gist, he takes the con­trast between so­cial and ego­istic as a given, stat­ic­ally. He no more re­cog­nizes in it the work of re­press­ive so­ci­ety than the trace of the dis­astrous mech­an­isms, which he him­self had de­scribed. Or rather, he os­cil­lates, the­ory­less and bend­ing to pre­ju­dice, between neg­at­ing the re­nun­ci­ation of the drives as a re­pres­sion con­trary to real­ity, or else prais­ing it as a sub­lim­a­tion which en­cour­ages cul­ture. Some­thing of the Janus char­ac­ter of cul­ture lives ob­ject­ively in this con­tra­dic­tion, and no amount of praise to healthy sen­su­al­ity can gloss over it. In Freud how­ever this res­ults in the de­valu­ation of the crit­ical stand­ard for the goal of the ana­lysis. Freud's un­en­lightened en­light­en­ment plays into the hands of bour­geois dis­il­lu­sion­ment. As the late op­pon­ent of hy­po­crisy, he stands am­bigu­ously between the will for out­right eman­cip­a­tion of the op­pressed and the apo­logy for out­right op­pres­sion. Reason for him is a mere su­per­struc­ture, not so much, as of­fi­cial philo­sophy charges, be­cause of his psy­cho­lo­gism, which pen­et­rates deeply enough into the his­tor­ical mo­ment, but on the con­trary be­cause he dis­cards the only pur­pose, both dis­tant from mean­ing and reas­on­less, in which the means of reason could prove it­self to be reas­on­able: pleas­ure. As soon as this lat­ter is dis­par­agingly clas­si­fied as a trick of spe­cies pre­ser­va­tion, dis­solved into sly reason, as it were, without nam­ing the mo­ment therein, which reaches bey­ond the circle of that which has lapsed back into nature \[]{.calibre3}[Naturver­fal­len­heit]{.calibre22}[\], the ra­tio de­gen­er­ates into ra­tion­al­iz­a­tion. Truth is con­signed to re­lativ­ity and hu­man be­ings to power. Only those who loc­ate uto­pia in the blind so­matic pleas­ure, which has no in­ten­tion and which stills this last, would be cap­able of an idea of truth which stood the test. In Freud's work, how­ever, the double enmity to­wards the spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[: mind\] and to­wards pleas­ure, whose com­mon root was pre­cisely what psy­cho­ana­lysis de­livered the means to com­pre­hend, un­will­ingly re­pro­duces it­self. The pas­sage in ]{.calibre3}[Fu­ture of an Il­lu­sion]{.calibre22}[, where the com­mer­cial trav­eler's maxim that heaven is to be left to the an­gels and the spar­rows is cited with the miser­able wis­dom of a bit­ter old man, is the com­pan­ion piece to that pas­sage from the ]{.calibre3}[Lec­tures]{.calibre22}[, where he con­demns in hor­ror the per­verse prac­tices of the jet set. Those who are equally dis­gus­ted by pleas­ure and heaven, in fact func­tion best as ob­jects: one can fre­quently ob­serve some­thing empty and mech­an­ized in suc­cess­fully ana­lyzed pa­tients, which should be reckoned not on ac­count of their sick­ness, but on their heal­ing, which breaks what it eman­cip­ates. The much-bal­ly­hooed thera­peutic trans­fer­ence -- whose res­ol­u­tion com­prises, and not for noth­ing, the crux of ana­lytic labor -- the elab­or­ate situ­ation, in which the sub­ject vol­un­tar­ily and calam­it­ously com­pletes that can­cel­la­tion of them­selves, which once seemed to be in­vol­un­tar­ily and hap­pily real­ized by de­voted­ness, is already the schema of a re­flect­ive mode of con­duct, which li­quid­ates, just like the fol­low­ers of the su­preme leader, all spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[: spirit, mind\] as well as the ana­lysts, who be­trayed it. ]{.calibre3}

[In­vit­a­tion to dance]{.calibre22}[. -- Psy­cho­ana­lysis likes to give it­self credit for re­turn­ing to hu­man be­ings their ca­pa­city for en­joy­ment, since this lat­ter is dis­rup­ted by neur­otic sick­ness. As if the mere term "ca­pa­city for en­joy­ment," as­sum­ing the thing even ex­ists, did not suf­fice to de­grade such in the worst pos­sible way. As if a hap­pi­ness, which is due to the spec­u­la­tion on hap­pi­ness, would not be the op­pos­ite of hap­pi­ness, a fur­ther tres­pass of in­sti­tu­tion­ally planned modes of con­duct into the ever-shrink­ing do­main of ex­per­i­ence. What sort of con­di­tion must the rul­ing con­scious­ness have achieved, when the bind­ing pro­clam­a­tion of ex­tra­vag­ance and cham­pagne-in­ebri­ation, formerly re­served for at­taches in Hun­garian oper­et­tas, is raised to a maxim of the right life in brute earn­est. De­creed hap­pi­ness looks ex­actly like what its name sug­gests: to par­take of it, the for­tu­nate neur­otic must also sac­ri­fice the last bit of reason left re­main­ing by re­pres­sion and re­gres­sion, and for the sake of the psy­cho­ana­lyst, has no choice but to find in­spir­a­tion in the trashy film, the ex­pens­ive but bad meal at the French res­taur­ant, the ser­i­ous "drink" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] and sexu­al­ity re­duced to doses of "sex" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]. Schiller's com­ment, "Life is beau­ti­ful non­ethe­less," al­ways a piece of pa­per-mâché, has be­come idiocy, ever since it has been trum­peted in chorus with that om­ni­present ad­vert­ising, in whose fan­fares even psy­cho­ana­lysis, des­pite its bet­ter pos­sib­il­it­ies, joins in. Since people have al­to­gether too few in­hib­i­tions rather than too many, without be­ing a jot health­ier for this, then a cath­artic method must, if it does not wish to be meas­ured in terms of suc­cess­ful ad­just­ment and eco­nomic suc­cess, aim at mak­ing hu­man be­ings aware of un­hap­pi­ness, of the gen­eral kind as well as that which is in­dis­sol­ubly their own; and to take from them the ap­par­ent sat­is­fac­tion, by vir­tue of which the hideous so­cial or­der per­petu­ates it­self within them, as if its ex­ternal grip were not already power­ful enough. Only in the sur­feit of false pleas­ure, in the con­trar­i­ness to what is offered, in the in­tu­ition of the in­ad­equacy of hap­pi­ness, even where it is still one -- let alone there, where it is bought by giv­ing up the sup­posedly sickly res­ist­ance against its pos­it­ive sur­rog­ate -- would the thought dawn, of what one might ex­per­i­ence. The in­junc­tions on "hap­pi­ness" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], in which the san­at­orium dir­ector who pre­scribes good liv­ing and the frantic pro­pa­ganda bosses of the en­ter­tain­ment in­dustry chime as one, bear the traits of the ra­ging father, who shrieks at the chil­dren, be­cause they aren't run­ning down­stairs in trans­ports of joy when he comes home from work in a bad mood. Part of the mech­an­ism of dom­in­a­tion is that one is for­bid­den to re­cog­nize the suf­fer­ing which that dom­in­a­tion pro­duces, and there is a straight line con­nect­ing the evan­gel­ical lec­ture on the joy of life to the con­struc­tion of slaughter-houses for hu­man be­ings so far off in Po­land, that every­one in one's own eth­nic group can con­vince them­selves they don't hear the screams of pain. That is the schema of the un­dis­turbed ca­pa­city for en­joy­ment. Those who name it as such, how­ever, are tri­umphantly dia­gnosed by the psy­cho­ana­lysts as merely suf­fer­ing from an Oed­ipal com­plex.]{.calibre3}

[Ego is id. -- ]{.calibre22}[It is cus­tom­ary to link the de­vel­op­ment of psy­cho­logy to the rise of the bour­geois in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[s: in­di­vidual\], in an­tiquity and since the Renais­sance. One should not over­look the con­trary mo­ment, which psy­cho­logy holds in com­mon with the bour­geois class, and which today has de­veloped into ex­clus­iv­ity: the op­pres­sion and dis­sol­u­tion of pre­cisely the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[s\], in whose ser­vice the re­cip­rocal re­la­tion­ship of cog­ni­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Erken­ntis]{.calibre22}[: cog­ni­tion, know­ledge\] to its sub­ject was based. If all psy­cho­logy since Prot­agoras el­ev­ated hu­man be­ings by think­ing of them as the meas­ure of all things, then it has also sim­ul­tan­eously and from the very be­gin­ning turned the lat­ter into ob­jects, ana­lytic ma­ter­ial, and con­signed them, once they are lined up as things, to nullity. The denial of ob­ject­ive truth through the re­course to the sub­ject im­plies its own neg­a­tion: no meas­ure re­mains for the meas­ure of all things, it de­cays into con­tin­gency and turns into un­truth. This how­ever points back to the real life-pro­cess of the so­ci­ety. The prin­ciple of hu­man dom­in­a­tion, which de­veloped into an ab­so­lute, has thereby turned its point against hu­man be­ings as the ab­so­lute ob­ject, and psy­cho­logy has par­ti­cip­ated in sharpen­ing that point. Un­der the gaze of the former, the ego, its lead­ing idea and its a pri­ori ob­ject, has al­ways been turned into some­thing non-ex­ist­ent. By draw­ing on the fact that the sub­ject is not really one in the ex­change-so­ci­ety, but is in fact an ob­ject, psy­cho­logy could de­liver the weapons which en­abled that so­ci­ety to turn it into one, and to keep it down. The de­com­pos­i­tion of hu­man be­ings into cap­ab­il­it­ies is a pro­jec­tion of the di­vi­sion of labor on its pre­sumed sub­jects, in­sep­ar­able from the in­terest in de­ploy­ing them with ul­terior motives, above all in or­der to be able to ma­nip­u­late them. Psy­cho­tech­nics is no mere de­cayed form of psy­cho­logy, but im­man­ent in its prin­ciple. Hume, in whose work every sen­tence test­i­fies to genu­ine hu­man­ism and yet sim­ul­tan­eously dis­misses the ego as a pre­ju­dice, ex­presses in such con­tra­dic­tions the es­sence of psy­cho­logy as such. In this he still had the truth on his side, for what the ego sets it­self up as, is in fact mere pre­ju­dice, the ideo­lo­gical hy­po­stasis of the ab­stract cen­ters of con­trol, and the cri­tique of this last de­man­ded the de­moli­tion of the ideo­logy of "per­son­al­ity." But this de­moli­tion sim­ul­tan­eously makes the residue that much more sus­cept­ible to con­trol. This be­comes flag­rant in psy­cho­ana­lysis. It con­fis­cates the per­son­al­ity as the lifelong lie, as the highest ra­tion­al­iz­a­tion which holds to­gether the count­less ra­tion­al­iz­a­tions, which en­able in­di­vidu­als \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] to achieve the re­nun­ci­ation of the drives and to align them­selves with the real­ity-prin­ciple. Pre­cisely by prov­ing such, how­ever, it sim­ul­tan­eously con­firms to hu­man be­ings their own non-ex­ist­ence. It ali­en­ates \[]{.calibre3}[en­taeussern]{.calibre22}[: to ali­en­ate, dis­close, real­ize\] them from them­selves, de­noun­cing their autonomy along with their unity and sub­ject­ing them com­pletely to the mech­an­ism of ra­tion­al­iz­a­tion -- that of ad­just­ment. The in­trepid cri­tique of the ego in it­self passes over into the de­mand, that the other's ought to ca­pit­u­late. In the end the wis­dom of the psy­cho­ana­lysis truly be­comes what the Fas­cist un­con­scious of the tabloid magazines con­siders it to be, to the tech­nics of a spe­cial racket among oth­ers, which ir­re­voc­ably binds help­less and suf­fer­ing hu­man be­ings to it­self, in or­der to com­mand them and ex­ploit them. Sug­ges­tion and hyp­nosis, once re­jec­ted as apo­chryphal, like a sideshow ma­gi­cian at the town mar­ket, re­turn in their gran­di­ose sys­tem once again like the short fea­ture in the block­buster film. The ones who help be­cause they know bet­ter, turn into the ones who hu­mi­li­ate oth­ers through bossy priv­ilege. What re­mains of the cri­tique of the bour­geois con­scious­ness is only that shrug­ging of the shoulders, by which all doc­tors have an­nounced their secret com­pli­city with death. -- In psy­cho­logy, in the bound­less fraud of what is merely in­ter­i­or­ized \[]{.calibre3}[bloss In­wendi­gen]{.calibre22}[\] (it is not for noth­ing that this has to do with the "prop­er­ties" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] of hu­man be­ings) is re­flec­ted what the or­gan­iz­a­tion of bour­geois so­ci­ety has since time im­me­morial prac­ticed on ex­ternal prop­erty. As a res­ult of so­cial ex­change, the former has de­veloped the lat­ter, only with an ob­ject­ive re­serve clause, which every bour­geois in­tu­its. The in­di­vidual per­son is thereby on loan, as it were, from its class, and those who are its func­tion­ar­ies are ready to take it back, as soon as gen­er­al­ized prop­erty en­dangers its prin­ciple, which con­sists pre­cisely of with­hold­ing. Psy­cho­logy re­peats in per­sonal traits, what happened to prop­erty. It ex­pro­pri­ates in­di­vidual per­sons, by ap­por­tion­ing its hap­pi­ness to them. ]{.calibre3}

Pre­fab en­light­en­ment trans­forms not only spon­tan­eous re­flec­tion, but also the ana­lytic in­sights, whose power is equi­val­ent to the en­ergy and pas­sion which it took to achieve them, into mass-pro­duced products, and the pain­ful secrets of in­di­vidual his­tory, which or­tho­doxy is already wont to re­duce to for­mu­las, into hum­drum con­ven­tions. The dis­sol­u­tion of ra­tion­al­iz­a­tions be­comes it­self a ra­tion­al­iz­a­tion.

Con­flicts thereby lose that which was threat­en­ing. They are ac­cep­ted; by no means healed, but merely slot­ted into the sur­face of a nor­mal­ized life like an in­ev­it­able piece of in­vent­ory. Sim­ul­tan­eously they are ab­sorbed, as a gen­eral ill, by the mech­an­ism of im­me­di­ate iden­ti­fic­a­tion of the in­di­vidual with the so­cial in­stance, which has long since taken hold of the pre­sum­ably nor­mal modes of con­duct. In the place of that cath­arsis, whose suc­cess was never guar­an­teed in ad­vance, steps the win­ning of pleas­ure \[]{.calibre3}[Lust­gewinn]{.calibre22}[\], of be­ing an ex­em­plar of the ma­jor­ity in one's own weak­ness; not in or­der to earn the prestige of the in­ter­est­ing patho­lo­gical case, as with the san­at­orium in­mates of yes­teryear, but on the con­trary in or­der to prove that one be­longs to the group pre­cisely by means of those de­fects, and to trans­fer the power and great­ness of the col­lect­ive to one­self. Nar­ciss­ism, which loses its li­bid­inal ob­ject due to the dis­as­sembly of the ego, is re­placed by mas­ochistic pleas­ure of no longer be­ing an ego, and the younger gen­er­a­tion guards its ego­less­ness with rare en­thu­si­asm, as a last­ing and com­mon pos­ses­sion. The realm of re­ific­a­tion and nor­mal­iz­a­tion is ex­ten­ded in this man­ner into its most ex­treme con­tra­dic­tion, that which is as­sumed to be ab­nor­mal and chaotic. What is in­com­men­sur­able is made, pre­cisely as such, com­men­sur­able, and the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] is hardly cap­able of an im­pulse any­more, which could not be named an ex­ample of this or that pub­licly ac­know­ledged con­stel­la­tion. Mean­while, such an ex­tern­ally ad­op­ted and per­fec­ted iden­ti­fic­a­tion -- one bey­ond, as it were, its own dy­namic -- ul­ti­mately ab­ol­ishes, along with the genu­ine con­scious­ness of the im­pulse, this last as well. It turns into the re­flex of ste­reo­typ­ical atoms to ste­reo­typ­ical stim­uli, to be flipped on and off like a switch. Moreover, the con­ven­tion­al­iz­a­tion of psy­cho­ana­lysis trig­gers its own cas­tra­tion: sexual motives, partly denied, partly ap­proved, be­come en­tirely harm­less, but also en­tirely void. Along with the fear, which they could pro­voke, also dis­ap­pears the pleas­ure, which they could ob­tain. Psy­cho­ana­lysis thus be­comes the vic­tim of pre­cisely that sub­sti­tu­tion of the ap­pro­pri­ate su­per­ego via the dogged ad­op­tion of a re­la­tion­less ex­ternal one, which it taught it­self to un­der­stand. The latest grandly con­cep­tu­al­ized the­orem of bour­geois self-cri­tique has turned into a means of trans­form­ing bour­geois self-ali­en­a­tion in its latest phase into an ab­so­lute, while thwart­ing the in­tu­ition of the age-old wound, which con­tains the hope of a bet­ter one in the fu­ture. ]{.calibre3}

[In­ner and outer. -- ]{.calibre22}[Out of piety, lazi­ness, and cal­cu­la­tion, philo­sophy con­tin­ues to muddle through in an ever nar­rower aca­demic frame­work, and even there, it is in­creas­ingly be­ing re­placed with or­gan­ized tau­to­logy. Who­ever en­trusts them­selves to cre­den­tialed pro­fund­ity, fall vic­tim just as a hun­dred years ago to the com­pul­sion to be, at every mo­ment, just as na­ive as one's col­leagues, on whom one's ca­reer de­pends. But ex­tra-aca­demic think­ing, which would like to elude such com­pul­sion as well as the con­tra­dic­tion between high-flown ma­ter­i­als and nar­row-minded \[]{.calibre3}[spiess­buer­ger­licher]{.calibre22}[: petty bour­geois\] treat­ment, is threatened by a scarcely less ur­gent danger: by the eco­nomic pres­sure of the mar­ket, which at least the pro­fess­ors in Europe were sheltered from. Philo­soph­ers who want to earn a liv­ing as au­thors, must of­fer at every in­stant some­thing rar­efied, some­thing ex­quis­ite, main­tain­ing them­selves through the mono­poly of rar­ity, as it were, as op­posed to that of cre­den­tials. The noi­some concept of the in­spir­a­tional sound-bite \[]{.calibre3}[geisti­gen Leck­er­bis­sens]{.calibre22}[: spir­itual tid­bit, taste of en­light­en­ment\], dreamed up by ped­ants, ends up scor­ing an em­bar­rass­ing point against its nay-say­ers. If the good old Schmock \[hack journ­al­ist in play by Freytag\] groaned un­der the news­pa­per ed­itor's de­mand, to write with con­stant bril­liance, then he also re­gisters in all naïvété the law which im­pli­citly presides over the works of the cos­mogonic Eros and the Cos­mos Atheos \[ref­er­ence to mys­tical work by Klages\], the shape-shift­ing of the gods and the secret of the gos­pel ac­cord­ing to St. John. The life-style of the be­lated bo­hemian, which is forced upon non-aca­demic philo­soph­ers, soon gives the former a fatal af­fin­ity to that which is artsy, spir­itu­ally kitschy, sec­tarian and half-edu­cated. The Mu­nich be­fore WW I was a breed­ing grounds for that spir­itu­al­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Geistigkeit]{.calibre22}[\], whose protest against the ra­tion­al­ism of the schools cul­min­ated, via the cult of the cos­tume fest­ivals, in Fas­cism even faster than the half-hearted sys­tem of old Rick­ert. So great is the power of the ad­van­cing or­gan­iz­a­tion of thought, that those who wish to stay out­side are driven to the van­ity of re­sent­ment, to the bab­bling of self-pro­mo­tion, and ul­ti­mately the van­quished ones to con games. When the pro­fess­ors posit the prin­ciple of sum ergo co­gito \[Latin: I think, there­fore I am\] and fall prey in the open sys­tem to agora­pho­bia, and in thrown­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­wor­fen­heit]{.calibre22}[: no­tori­ous Heide­g­gerian term\] to the pre-in­dus­trial com­munity \[]{.calibre3}[Volks­ge­meinsch­aft]{.calibre22}[: folk com­munity, no­tori­ous term of Nazi pro­pa­ganda\], then their op­pon­ents go astray, un­less they are very much on guard, in the real of graph­o­logy and aer­obics \[]{.calibre3}[rhythmis­chen Gym­nastik]{.calibre22}[\]. The com­puls­ive types there cor­res­pond to the para­noids here. The wist­ful op­pos­i­tion to fac­tual re­search, the le­git­im­ate con­scious­ness that sci­ent­ism for­gets what is best, ex­acer­bates through its naïvété the split from which it suf­fers. In­stead of com­pre­hend­ing the facts, be­hind which oth­ers are bar­ri­caded, it hur­riedly throws to­gether whatever it can grab from them, rush­ing off to play so un­crit­ic­ally with apo­chryphal cog­ni­tions, with a couple isol­ated and hy­po­stat­ized cat­egor­ies, and with it­self, that it is eas­ily dis­posed of by re­fer­ring to the un­yield­ing facts. It is pre­cisely the crit­ical ele­ment which is lost in the ap­par­ently in­de­pend­ent thought. The in­sist­ence on the secret of the world hid­den be­neath the shell, which dares not ex­plain how it relates to the shell, only re­con­firms through such ab­ste­mi­ous­ness the thought that there must be good reas­ons for that shell, which one ought to ac­cept without ques­tion. Between the pleas­ure of empti­ness and the lie of plen­it­ude, the rul­ing con­di­tion of the spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[: mind\] per­mits no third op­tion.]{.calibre3}

[Nev­er­the­less the glance at what is re­mote, the hatred of banal­ity, the search for that which has not yet been grasped, for what has not been en­com­passed by the gen­eral con­cep­tual schema, is the last chance for thought. In an in­tel­lec­tual \[geisti­gen\] hier­archy, which con­tinu­ally holds every­one re­spons­ible, then ir­re­spons­ib­il­ity alone is cap­able of im­me­di­ately call­ing the hier­archy it­self by name. The sphere of cir­cu­la­tion, whose marks are borne by in­tel­lec­tual out­siders, opens the last refuges to the spirit \[Geist\], which it is selling off, at the mo­ment when these no longer really ex­ist.

### [42]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

[Free­dom of thought]{.calibre22}[. -- The sup­pres­sion of philo­sophy by sci­ence has led, as is com­monly known, to a sep­ar­a­tion of the two ele­ments whose unity, ac­cord­ing to Hegel, com­prises the life of philo­sophy: re­flec­tion and spec­u­la­tion. The land of truth is soberly con­signed to de­term­in­a­tions of re­flec­tion, and spec­u­la­tions are tol­er­ated therein with an ill grace, solely as a mere for­mu­la­tion of hy­po­theses, which are to be thought up out­side of work­ing hours and solved as quickly as pos­sible. Who­ever might be­lieve that the spec­u­lat­ive realm is pre­served, un­dis­puted, in its ex­tra-sci­entific realm -- left in peace, as it were, by the hustle and bustle of uni­ver­sal stat­ist­ics -- is thor­oughly mis­taken. Spec­u­la­tion is hit hard from the out­set by the sep­ar­a­tion from re­flec­tion. It either de­grades into the com­pli­ant par­rot­ing of tra­di­tional philo­soph­ical schemes or de­gen­er­ates, in its dis­tance from facts which have been rendered blind, into the babble of a non-bind­ing private world view. Not con­tent with this, the sci­entific en­ter­prise in­cor­por­ates spec­u­la­tion into it­self. Among the pub­lic func­tions of psy­cho­ana­lysis, this is not the least. Its me­dium is the free as­so­ci­ation. The road into the un­con­scious of the pa­tient is con­struc­ted by ex­cus­ing them of the re­spons­ib­il­ity for re­flec­tion, and the ana­lyt­ical form­a­tion of the­ory fol­lows the same track, whether it takes its cue from the pro­gres­sion and block­ages of those as­so­ci­ations, or whether the ana­lyst, even the most gif­ted ones like Grod­deck, trust to their own as­so­ci­ations. Re­laxed on the ana­lyst's couch, one re­hearses what was once achieved by the most ex­treme ex­er­tion of thought by Schelling and Hegel in the lec­turer's po­dium: the de­cod­ing of the phe­nomenon. But such a re­lax­a­tion of ten­sion af­fects the qual­ity of the think­ing: the dif­fer­ence is hardly less than that between the philo­sophy of rev­el­a­tion \[Schelling's later philo­sophy\] and the gos­sip of the mother-in-law. The same move­ment of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[\], whose "ma­ter­ial" was formerly to be raised to the concept, is it­self de­graded to a mere ma­ter­ial for the con­cep­tual so­cial or­der. Whatever ideas cross one's mind, are good enough for ex­perts to de­cide whether the ori­gin­ator is a com­puls­ive char­ac­ter, an oral type or a hys­teric. By vir­tue of the slack­en­ing of re­spons­ib­il­ity, which lies in the sep­ar­a­tion from the re­flec­tion, from the con­trol of un­der­stand­ing, spec­u­la­tion is con­signed to sci­ence as an ob­ject, whose sub­jectiv­ity is ex­tin­guished along with it. Thought, by al­low­ing the ad­min­is­trat­ive schema of the ana­lysis to re­call its un­con­scious ori­gins, for­gets to be thought. From the true judg­ment, it turns into a neut­ral ma­ter­ial. In­stead of mas­ter­ing it­self by per­form­ing the labor of the concept, it power­lessly en­trusts its own pro­cessing to the doc­tor, who already knows everything any­way. Thus spec­u­la­tion is con­clus­ively broken and turned into a fact, which can be filed in one of the branches of clas­si­fic­a­tion as a piece of evid­ence of what is al­ways the same.]{.calibre3}

[Fear-mon­ger­ing does not ap­ply]{.calibre22}[. -- What the truth might ob­ject­ively be, re­mains dif­fi­cult enough to dis­cern, but when deal­ing with hu­man be­ings one should not al­low one­self to be ter­ror­ized by this. There are cri­teria there, which seem sat­is­fy­ing at first. One of the most re­li­able is the re­proach that an ex­pres­sion is "too sub­ject­ive." If this is laid down with that in­dig­na­tion, which echoes with the furi­ous har­mony of all reas­on­able people, then one has reason to be sat­is­fied with one­self for a couple of seconds. The con­cepts of what is sub­ject­ive and what is ob­ject­ive have been com­pletely in­ver­ted. Ob­ject­ive means the non-con­tro­ver­sial side of the phe­nomenon \[]{.calibre3}[Er­schein­ung]{.calibre22}[\], its un­ques­tioned im­print, taken as it is, the facade con­struc­ted out of clas­si­fied data, there­fore the sub­ject­ive; and they call sub­ject­ive, whatever breaks through such, emer­ging out of the spe­cific ex­per­i­ence of the thing, di­vest­ing it­self of pre­judged con­ven­tion and set­ting the re­la­tion to the ob­ject in place of the ma­jor­ity de­cision con­cern­ing such, which they can­not even see, let alone think -- there­fore, what is ob­ject­ive. How vacu­ous the formal ob­jec­tion to sub­ject­ive re­lativ­ity is, can be ob­served in its own ac­tual field, that of aes­thetic judg­ments. Those who have sub­jec­ted them­selves in earn­est, out of the en­ergy of their pre­cise re­ac­tion, to the dis­cip­line of a work of art, to the com­pul­sion of its shape, of its im­man­ent law of form, find the ob­jec­tion against what is merely sub­ject­ive in their ex­per­i­ence dis­solv­ing like a thread­bare ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\], and every step they take fur­ther into the mat­ter, by vir­tue of their ex­treme sub­ject­ive in­nerv­a­tion, has in­com­par­ably greater ob­ject­ive power than com­pre­hens­ive and much-vin­dic­ated con­cep­tual form­a­tions, such as that of "style," whose sci­entific claim comes at the cost of such ex­per­i­ence. This is doubly true in the era of pos­it­iv­ism and of the cul­ture-in­dustry, whose ob­jectiv­ity is cal­cu­lated by ad­min­is­trat­ing sub­jects. In con­trast to this, reason has fled com­pletely into eye­less \[]{.calibre3}[fen­ster­los]{.calibre22}[\] idio­syn­crasy, which the caprice of the power-brokers cas­tig­ates as caprice, be­cause they want the power­less­ness of sub­jects, out of fear of the ob­jectiv­ity, which alone is sub­lated in these sub­jects. ]{.calibre3}

### [44]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

[For post-So­crat­ics]{.calibre22}[. -- Noth­ing is less worthy of in­tel­lec­tu­als, who have un­der­taken to achieve what was earlier called philo­sophy, than the wish to be proved cor­rect in the dis­cus­sion, and one would like to say, in the cita­tion of evid­ence. The wish to be proved cor­rect, down to its most subtle lo­gical form of re­flec­tion, is the ex­pres­sion of that spirit \[Geistes\] of self-pre­ser­va­tion, whose dis­sol­u­tion makes up the par­tic­u­lar con­cern of philo­sophy. I knew someone who met with all the celebrit­ies from epi­stem­o­logy, the nat­ural sci­ences and so­cial sci­ences, one after an­other, thor­oughly dis­cussed his sys­tem with each one and, after no-one dared to raise an ar­gu­ment against its form­al­ism, con­sidered his work con­clus­ively es­tab­lished. Some­thing of such naïvété is ubi­quit­ous in works where philo­sophy even dis­tantly re­sembles the ges­ture of con­vic­tion. Un­der­ly­ing this is the pre­requis­ite of the uni­versitas lit­erarum \[Latin: uni­ver­sal lit­er­acy\], an a pri­ori com­mon agree­ment of minds \[]{.calibre3}[Geister]{.calibre22}[: minds, spir­its\], which are able to com­mu­nic­ate with each other, and thereby in­deed on com­plete con­form­ism. When philo­soph­ers, well-known for be­ing averse to si­lence, enter into a con­ver­sa­tion, then they should speak as if they were be­ing proved wrong, but in a man­ner which con­victs the op­pon­ent of un­truth. The point is not to gen­er­ate cog­ni­tions which are ab­so­lutely cor­rect, bul­let­proof and wa­ter­tight -- these run un­avoid­ably into tau­to­logy -- but rather those which dir­ect the ques­tion of their cor­rect­ness to­wards them­selves. -- This is not to ar­gue for ir­ra­tion­al­ism, the pos­it­ing of ca­pri­cious theses, jus­ti­fied through the rev­el­at­ory be­liefs of in­tu­ition, but the ab­ol­i­tion of the dis­tinc­tion between thesis and ar­gu­ment. To think dia­lect­ic­ally means, in this re­spect, that the ar­gu­ment should achieve the crit­ic­al­ity \[Drastik\] of the thesis and the thesis should con­tain the plen­it­ude of its ground within it­self. All bridging con­cepts, all con­nec­tions and lo­gical help­ing op­er­a­tions, which are not in the mat­ter it­self, all sec­ond­ary con­sequences not suf­fused with the ex­per­i­ence of the ob­ject, should fall away. In a philo­soph­ical text, all pro­pos­i­tions should stand equally near to the mid­point. Though Hegel would never have said as much, his en­tire pro­ced­ure test­i­fies to this in­ten­tion. Since it does not re­cog­nize that which is first, then strictly speak­ing neither should it re­cog­nize that which is second or de­rived, and it has dis­placed the concept of me­di­ation from formal in­ter­ven­ing de­term­in­a­tions into the mat­ter it­self, thereby seek­ing to over­come its dif­fer­ence from a think­ing which is ex­ternal to such or me­di­ates it. The lim­its to the suc­cess of such an in­ten­tion in the Hegel­ian philo­sophy, are sim­ul­tan­eously the lim­its of its truth, namely the rem­nants of ]{.calibre3}[prima philo­sophia]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: first philo­sophy\], the sup­pos­i­tion that the sub­ject is some­thing which in spite of everything is "first." One of the tasks of dia­lect­ical lo­gic is to ex­punge the last traces of the de­duct­ive sys­tem, to­gether with the last leg­al­istic \[ad­vokat­or­ischen\] ges­tures of thought. ]{.calibre3}

### [45]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

["]{.calibre3}[Yet how ill does everything grow­ing seem\...]{.calibre22}[" \[Quote from poem by Trakl\] -- Dia­lect­ical think­ing de­fies re­ific­a­tion also in the sense, that it re­fuses to con­firm the in­di­vidual as singled-out and in sep­ar­ate­ness: it as­cer­tains pre­cisely this isol­a­tion as the product of the gen­eral. Thus it works as a cor­rect­ive against manic fix­ity as well as the un­res­ist­ing and empty drift of the para­noid spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[\], which pays for the ab­so­lute judg­ment with the sac­ri­fice of the ex­per­i­ence of the mat­ter \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[\]. But for that reason dia­lectics is non­ethe­less not what it be­came in the Eng­lish Hegel­ian school and then all the more so in Dewey's strenu­ous prag­mat­ism, the "sense of pro­por­tions" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], the put­ting of things in their cor­rect per­spect­ive, simple but in­tract­able com­mon sense. If Hegel seemed to come close to such a view in his con­ver­sa­tions with Goethe, de­fend­ing his philo­sophy against Goethean Pla­ton­ism by say­ing that the former was "fun­da­ment­ally noth­ing more than the reg­u­lar, meth­od­ic­ally con­struc­ted spirit of con­tra­dic­tion, which dwells within all hu­man be­ings," a "gift which proves its worth in the dis­tinc­tion of the true from the false," then the canny for­mu­la­tion con­tains, trick­ster-style, in the praise of "what dwells within every hu­man be­ing," the sim­ul­tan­eous de­nun­ci­ation of the "com­mon sense" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] which is made into its in­ner­most de­term­in­a­tion, be­cause it can­not be de­rived from "com­mon sense" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal," but con­tra­dicts such. "Com­mon sense" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], the ap­praisal of cor­rect re­la­tion­ships, the cos­mo­pol­itan, prac­ticed eye, schooled in the mar­ket, shares with the dia­lectic the free­dom from dogma, lim­it­a­tion and pre­ju­dice. Its sobri­ety forms an in­dis­pens­able mo­ment of crit­ical think­ing. But also its sworn en­emy, due to the re­nun­ci­ation of de­lu­sion­ary way­ward­ness. The gen­er­al­ity of the opin­ion, im­me­di­ately as­sumed as one in so­ci­ety, as it is, ne­ces­sar­ily has con­sensus as its con­crete con­tent. It is no ac­ci­dent that in the 19th cen­tury it was pre­cisely out­worn dog­mat­ism, af­flic­ted by the En­light­en­ment with a bad con­science, ap­pealed to com­mon sense, so that an arch-pos­it­iv­ist like Mill was com­pelled to po­lem­i­cize against such. The "sense of pro­por­tions" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] wholly relates to the in­junc­tion to think in the stand­ard re­la­tion­ships and or­ders of mag­nitude of life, which re­main fixed. One need only have once heard the dyed-in-the-wool rep­res­ent­at­ive of a rul­ing clique say, "That's of no im­port­ance," one need only ob­serve at what times the bour­geoisie speaks of ex­ag­ger­a­tion, hys­teria, and fool­ish­ness, to know that it is pre­cisely where the ap­peal to reason emerges most promptly, that the is­sue un­avoid­ably con­cerns an apo­logy for un­reason. Hegel em­phas­ized the healthy spirit of con­tra­dic­tion with the hard­headed­ness of the peas­ant, who has learned over the cen­tur­ies to with­stand the hunts and tithes of the mighty feudal lords. It is the spe­cial con­cern of philo­sophy to knock the healthy view­points held by later power-brokers re­gard­ing the im­mut­ab­il­ity of the course of the world for a loop, and to de­code in their "pro­por­tions" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] the true and re­duced mir­ror-im­age of im­meas­ur­ably en­larged dis­pro­por­tions. Dia­lect­ical reason \[]{.calibre3}[Ver­nunft]{.calibre22}[: reason\] is, against the rul­ing one, un­reason \[]{.calibre3}[Un­vernunft]{.calibre22}[\]: only by car­ry­ing over and sub­lat­ing the lat­ter, does it be­come ra­tional \[]{.calibre3}[ver­nün­ftig]{.calibre22}[: reas­on­able, ra­tional\]. How biased and Talmudic in­deed was the in­sist­ence, in the middle of the func­tion­ing ex­change so­ci­ety, on the dis­tinc­tion between the total work-hours ex­pen­ded by work­ers and those ne­ces­sary for the re­pro­duc­tion of their lives. How Ni­et­z­sche put the cart be­fore the horses, on which he charged, how Karl Kraus, Kafka, even Proust, each in their own man­ner, fals­i­fied the pic­ture of the world in a biased man­ner, in or­der to shake off fals­ity and bias. Dia­lectics may not stop be­fore the con­cepts of the healthy and the sick, nor in­deed be­fore the lat­ters' fam­ily re­la­tions, the ra­tional and the ir­ra­tional. Once it re­cog­nizes the rul­ing gen­er­al­ity and its pro­por­tions as sick -- and marked in the most lit­eral sense with para­noia, with "pathic pro­jec­tion" -- then it finds the cells of heal­ing solely in what the stand­ards of that so­cial or­der por­tray as sick, ab­surd, para­noid -- in­deed, "in­sane," and it is true as today as in the me­di­eval era, that only fools speak the truth to power. In this re­spect it is the duty of the dia­lec­tician to help this truth of the fool to at­tain the con­scious­ness of its own reason \[]{.calibre3}[Ver­nunft]{.calibre22}[\], without which it would in­deed per­ish in the abyss of that sick­ness, piti­lessly dic­tated by the com­mon sense of oth­ers. ]{.calibre3}

[On the eth­ics \[Moral\] of think­ing]{.calibre22}[. -- Na­ive and un­naïve, these are con­cepts which are so closely in­ter­twined, that noth­ing good will come of play­ing one against the other. The de­fense of the na­ive, un­der­taken by ir­ra­tion­al­ists and in­tel­lec­tual-haters of all kinds, is ig­noble. The re­flec­tion which takes the side of naïvété, turns against it­self: clev­erness and ob­scur­ant­ism have ever been the same. By up­hold­ing im­me­di­acy via me­di­ation, in­stead of com­pre­hend­ing the former as some­thing me­di­ated in it­self, think­ing in­verts into the apo­lo­get­ics of its own op­pos­ite, into the im­me­di­ate lie. It serves all sorts of bad ends, from the ob­dur­ate­ness of the private things-are-just-so to the jus­ti­fic­a­tion of so­cial in­justice as Nature. If one wished how­ever to raise the op­pos­ite to a prin­ciple and -- as I my­self once did -- call philo­sophy the bind­ing ob­lig­a­tion to the un­naïve, then one does hardly any bet­ter. It is not merely that un naïvété is a du­bi­ous me­dium of cog­ni­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Erken­nt­nis]{.calibre22}[\] in the sense of ad­ept­ness, hard-bit­ten­ness, quick-wit­ted­ness, al­ways pre­pared, through af­fin­ity to the prac­tical so­cial or­ders of life, and the all-round men­tal re­ser­va­tion against the­ory, to re­bound into naïvété, the fixed gaze on pur­poses. Even where un naïvété is grasped in the the­or­et­ic­ally re­spons­ible sense of what broadens, of what does not re­main in the isol­ated phe­nomenon, of the thought of the whole, a shadow falls. It is just that broad­en­ing and in­ab­il­ity to tarry, that im­pli­cit re­cog­ni­tion of the pri­or­ity of the gen­er­al­ity over the par­tic­u­lar, which com­prises not only the de­cep­tion of ideal­ism, which hy­po­stas­izes con­cepts, but also its in­hu­man­ity, which de­grades the par­tic­u­lar, as soon as it seizes such, to a mere way-sta­tion and fi­nally makes its peace with suf­fer­ing and death, in a re­con­cili­ation which takes place only in the re­flec­tion -- in the fi­nal ana­lysis, the bour­geois cold­ness, which is all too happy to sign on to what is in­ev­it­able. Know­ledge may broaden only where it per­sists by the in­di­vidual, so that its isol­a­tion is dis­as­sembled by this in­sist­ence. This pre­sup­poses to be sure a re­la­tion­ship to the gen­er­al­ity, though not one of sub­sump­tion, but al­most its op­pos­ite. Dia­lect­ical me­di­ation is not the re­course to what is more ab­stract, but the pro­cess of res­ol­u­tion of the con­crete in it­self. Ni­et­z­sche, who him­self thought in all too wide ho­ri­zons, knew some­thing of this: "Those who wish to me­di­ate between two in­cis­ive thinkers," reads a pas­sage in ]{.calibre3}[The Gay Sci­ence]{.calibre22}[, "are marked as me­diocre: they do not have eyes for what is unique; see­ing things as the same and mak­ing things the same are the hall­marks of weak vis­ion." The eth­ics \[Moral\] of think­ing do not con­sist of pro­ceed­ing in a stub­born or sov­er­eign man­ner, nor blindly or emptily, nor atom­ist­ic­ally or con­sequen­tially. The double-sided­ness of the method, which among reas­on­able people gave to Hegel­ian phe­nomen­o­logy with name of abyssal dif­fi­culty by reas­on­able people, namely the de­mand, to al­low the phe­nomenon to speak as such -- the "pure on­look­ing" -- and yet at every mo­ment to main­tain the re­flec­tion, its re­la­tion to the con­scious­ness as a sub­ject, ex­presses this ethos most acutely and in full depth of the con­tra­dic­tion. Yet how much more dif­fi­cult this is to achieve, if one can no longer as­sume the iden­tity of sub­ject and ob­ject, the ul­ti­mate as­sump­tion which en­abled Hegel to con­ceal the ant­ag­on­istic de­mands of on-look­ing and con­strual. Noth­ing less is de­man­ded of those who think today, than to be at every mo­ment in the mat­ter \[]{.calibre3}[Sachen]{.calibre22}[\] and out­side of the mat­ter \[]{.calibre3}[Sachen]{.calibre22}[\] -- the ges­ture of Münch­hausen, who pulled him­self out of the swamp by his own pig­tails, be­comes the schemata of every cog­ni­tion, which wishes to be more than either a fixed de­term­in­a­tion or a pro­pos­i­tion. And then the philo­soph­ers still come along and re­proach us, for not hav­ing a fixed stand­point. ]{.calibre3}

[De gus­ti­bus est dis­putan­dum ]{.calibre22}[\[Latin: There is no ac­count­ing for taste.\] -- Even those who are con­vinced of the in­com­par­ab­il­ity of works of art, find them­selves con­tinu­ally en­tangled in de­bates where works of art, and pre­cisely those of the highest and for that reason in­com­par­able rank, are com­pared with and eval­u­ated against each other. The ob­jec­tion in­vari­ably raised dur­ing such con­sid­er­a­tions, that it is all just a mat­ter of col­lect­ors' in­stincts, of meas­ur­ing by ells, usu­ally means only that the good cit­izens, to whom art can never be ir­ra­tional enough, wish to keep the in­ner con­sti­tu­tion and claim of truth dis­tant from the works. The com­pul­sion of the con­sid­er­a­tion is how­ever loc­ated in the work of art it­self. So much is true, that they do not al­low them­selves to be com­pared. Rather, they want to an­ni­hil­ate each other. It is not for noth­ing that the an­cients \[i.e. Greeks\] re­served the pan­theon of that which is com­pat­ible to the gods or to ideas, but re­quired works of art to enter the ]{.calibre3}[agon]{.calibre22}[ \[Greek: con­test, con­flict, struggle\], each one the mor­tal en­emy of the other. The de­pic­tion of a "pan­theon of clas­si­cism," which Kierkegaard still clung to, is a fic­tion of neut­ral­ized up­bring­ing. For if the idea of the beau­ti­ful is por­trayed as merely di­vided up into many works, each in­di­vidual one nev­er­the­less reck­ons on an in­ali­en­able claim to the whole, claim­ing the beau­ti­ful for it­self out of its unique­ness and can never ad­mit its seg­ment­a­tion, without an­nulling it­self. The beau­ti­ful, as some­thing unit­ary, true and ap­pear­ance­less \[]{.calibre3}[schein­los]{.calibre22}[\], eman­cip­ated from such in­di­vidu­ation, is not rep­res­en­ted by the syn­thesis of all works, by the unity of arts and of art, but solely cor­por­eally and ac­tu­ally: in the down­fall of art it­self. Every work of art aims at such a down­fall, by seek­ing the death of all the oth­ers. That all art reck­ons on its own end, is an­other way of stat­ing the same state of af­fairs. It is out of such a com­pul­sion to­wards self-an­ni­hil­a­tion in works of art, from their in­ner­most con­cern, that drives to­wards the ap­pear­ance­less \[]{.calibre3}[schein­los]{.calibre22}[\] pic­ture of what is beau­ti­ful, which stirs up seem­ingly use­less aes­thetic dis­putes over and over again. While they stub­bornly and ob­stin­ately wish to find what is aes­thet­ic­ally cor­rect \[]{.calibre3}[Recht]{.calibre22}[\] and pre­cisely thereby fall vic­tim to an un­quench­able dia­lectic, they are more cor­rect than they can know; by de­lim­it­ing each art-work, whose en­ergy they take into them­selves and raise to a concept, they work to­wards the de­struc­tion of art, which is its sal­va­tion. The aes­thetic tol­er­ance, which val­id­ates works of art in their im­me­di­ate nar­row­ness, without break­ing this last, yields only the wrong down­fall, that of the jux­ta­pos­i­tion, which denies the claim of the unit­ary truth. ]{.calibre3}

### [48]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

[For Anatole France]{.calibre22}[. -- A ques­tion­able mo­ment be­gins to sur­face in vir­tues such as open-minded­ness, the ca­pa­city to vouch­safe and en­joy the beau­ti­ful, even in what is most mundane and un­ap­par­ent. Once, in the epoch of over­flow­ing sub­ject­ive plen­it­ude, aes­thetic in­dif­fer­ence in re­la­tion to the choice of the ob­ject, as well the en­ergy to ex­tract mean­ing from everything one ex­per­i­enced, ex­pressed the re­la­tion to the ob­ject­ive world it­self, a re­la­tion which con­fron­ted the sub­ject ant­ag­on­ist­ic­ally -- down into all of its frag­ments, as it were -- and yet closely and sig­ni­fic­antly. In a phase when the sub­ject ab­dic­ates be­fore the ali­en­ated he­ge­mony of things, its read­i­ness to vouch­safe what is every­where pos­it­ive or beau­ti­ful, dis­plays a resig­na­tion of crit­ical ca­pa­city as much as of the in­ter­pret­ive ima­gin­a­tion in­sep­ar­able from such. Who­ever finds everything beau­ti­ful, is now in danger of find­ing noth­ing beau­ti­ful. The gen­er­al­ity of the beau­ti­ful is com­mu­nic­ated to the sub­ject in no other way than the ob­ses­sion with the par­tic­u­lar. No gaze achieves beauty, without be­ing ac­com­pan­ied by in­dif­fer­ence, and well-nigh con­tempt for everything out­side of the viewed ob­ject. And it is solely through be­daz­zle­ment \[]{.calibre3}[Verblendung]{.calibre22}[: dazzle, in­fatu­ation\], the un­just clos­ure of the gaze ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ the claim raised by everything which ex­ists, that justice is done to what ex­ists. By be­ing ac­cep­ted in its one-sided­ness, for what it is, its one-sided­ness is un­der­stood as its es­sence and re­con­ciled. The gaze which loses it­self in some­thing which is beau­ti­ful, is one of the Sab­bath \[day of re­pose in Juda­ism\]. It res­cues in the ob­ject some­thing of the peace­ful­ness of its day of cre­ation. How­ever if this one-sided­ness is sub­lated by a con­scious­ness of the uni­ver­sal im­posed from out­side, if the par­tic­u­lar is har­ried, sub­sti­tuted and weighed up, then the just view of the whole makes the uni­ver­sal in­justice, which lies in ex­change­ab­il­ity and sub­sti­tu­tion, its own. Such justice turns into the ex­ecutor of mythos upon cre­ation. To be sure, no thought is im­mune to such in­ter­weav­ing, none may be blinkered. But everything de­pends on the man­ner of the trans­ition. The mis­chief comes from thought as might \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­walt]{.calibre22}[: power, vi­ol­ence\], the short­cut of the path which finds the gen­er­al­ity solely through what is im­pen­et­rable, whose the­or­et­ical con­tent \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­halt]{.calibre22}[\] is pre­served in im­pen­et­rab­il­ity it­self, not in the de­rived con­gru­ence of vari­ous ob­jects. One could al­most say that the truth it­self de­pends on the tempo, pa­tience and dur­a­tion of the tar­ry­ing on the par­tic­u­lar: what goes bey­ond this, without hav­ing en­tirely lost it­self, what pro­ceeds to judg­ment, without mak­ing it­self guilty of the in­justice of the in­tu­ition \[]{.calibre3}[An­schauung]{.calibre22}[\], loses it­self in the end in the void. Lib­er­al­ity, which grants rights to hu­man be­ings in­dis­crim­in­ately, amounts to an­ni­hil­a­tion, just like the will of the ma­jor­ity which in­flicts harm on the minor­ity, and thus makes a mock­ery of the demo­cracy, ac­cord­ing to whose prin­ciples they act. In­dis­crim­in­ate be­ne­vol­ence to­wards all con­stantly threatens that cold­ness and re­mote­ness against each, which are once again com­mu­nic­ated to the whole. In­justice is the me­dium of true justice. Un­res­tric­ted be­ne­vol­ence turns into the con­firm­a­tion of everything which is bad, by be­littling its dif­fer­ence from the trace of what is good and lev­el­ing it to that gen­er­al­ity, which springs hope­lessly from the bour­geois-Mephis­tophelean wis­dom, that everything which ex­ists, de­serves to per­ish. \[Cita­tion from Goethe's ]{.calibre3}[Faust]{.calibre22}[\] The sal­va­tion of beauty even in what is lackluster or in­dif­fer­ent ap­pears that much more no­bler as the ob­stin­ate in­sist­ence on cri­tique and spe­cific­a­tion, as they are in truth more pli­able to the so­cial or­ders of life.]{.calibre3}

[Mo­bil­ized against this is the sanc­tity of what is alive, which is re­flec­ted pre­cisely in what is most ugly and dis­tor­ted. But its re­flec­tion is noth­ing im­me­di­ate, but solely some­thing re­frac­ted: what is sup­posed to be beau­ti­ful just be­cause it is alive, is for that reason already what is ugly. The concept of life in its ab­strac­tion, to which re­course is made here, is by no means to be sep­ar­ated from what is re­press­ive, re­lent­less, truly deadly and de­struct­ive. The cult of life in it­self al­ways amounts to that of these forces. Whatever the ex­pres­sion of life may mean, from brim­ming fer­til­ity and the fren­etic drives of chil­dren, all the way to the com­pet­ence of those who cobble to­gether some­thing cor­rectly and the high spir­its of the wife, who is id­ol­ized be­cause ap­pet­ite shows in her so un­re­servedly -- all of this, taken ab­so­lutely, has some­thing of the tak­ing away of the light from oth­ers, of what is pos­sible, in blind self-per­petu­ation. Rampant health as such is al­ways already sick­ness. Its an­ti­dote is sick­ness which is con­scious of it­self, the de­lim­it­a­tion of life it­self. Beauty is such heal­ing sick­ness. It ar­rests life and thereby its de­cay. How­ever if one denied sick­ness for the sake of life, then the hy­po­stat­ized life passes over, by vir­tue of its blind sep­ar­a­tion from the other mo­ment, into what is de­struct­ive and malevol­ent, in­solent and self-ag­grand­iz­ing. Who­ever hates what is de­struct­ive, must hate life along with it: only what is dead is an al­legory \[]{.calibre3}[Gleich­nis]{.calibre22}[: al­legory, par­able, ana­logy\] of what is liv­ing and un­dis­tor­ted. Anatole France real­ized some­thing of this, in his en­lightened way. "No," says the oth­er­wise mild-mannered Mr. Bergeret, "I would rather be­lieve, that or­ganic life is the spe­cial ill­ness of our un­lovely planet. It would be un­bear­able to think that there is noth­ing but eat­ing and be­ing eaten through­out the end­less uni­verse." The ni­hil­istic an­ti­pathy in his words is not merely the psy­cho­lo­gical but also the ma­ter­ial pre­con­di­tion of hu­man­ity as uto­pia. ]{.calibre3}

### [49]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

[Eth­ics \[Moral\] and tem­poral or­der]{.calibre22}[. -- While lit­er­at­ure has dealt with all man­ner of erotic con­flicts, the simplest ex­ternal motive for con­flict has re­mained un­touched, due to its ob­vi­ous­ness. That is the phe­nomenon of be­ing already taken: that a per­son be­loved by us is in­ac­cess­ible not be­cause of in­ner ant­ag­on­isms and in­hib­i­tions, too much cold­ness or overly repressed warmth, but be­cause a re­la­tion­ship already ex­ists, which ex­cludes a new one. The ab­stract tem­poral or­der plays in truth the role which one would like to ascribe to the hier­archy of the feel­ings. The state of be­ing taken, leav­ing aside free­dom of choice and the de­cision, also has some­thing wholly ac­ci­dental about it, which ap­pears to thor­oughly con­tra­dict the claim of free­dom. Even and ex­actly in a so­ci­ety healed from the an­archy of com­mod­ity pro­duc­tion, there would scarcely be rules re­gard­ing how and in what or­der one got to know people. Were it any dif­fer­ent, then such an ar­range­ment would equate to the most un­bear­able as­sault on free­dom. For that reason, the pri­or­ity of what is ac­ci­dental has power­ful reas­ons on its side: if a new per­son is pre­ferred over an­other, then the lat­ter is slighted, be­cause the past of the com­mon life is an­nulled, ex­per­i­ence it­self is, as it were, crossed out. The ir­re­vers­ib­il­ity of time sets an ob­ject­ive moral cri­terion. But this lat­ter is en­twined with mythos, like ab­stract time it­self. The ex­clus­iv­ity pos­ited in it de­vel­ops ac­cord­ing to its own concept into the ex­clus­ive rule of her­met­ic­ally sealed groups, fi­nally to that of large-scale in­dustry. Noth­ing can be more touch­ing than the worry of lov­ers, that a new per­son could at­tract love and ten­der­ness -- their finest pos­ses­sions, just be­cause they can­not be pos­sessed -- pre­cisely by means of that new­ness, which is it­self pro­duced by the priv­ilege of the older. But from this touch­ing­ness, whose dis­in­teg­ra­tion would mean the sim­ul­tan­eous dis­in­teg­ra­tion of all warmth and snug­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­bor­gen­sein]{.calibre22}[\], leads an ir­res­ist­ible path from the aver­sion of the little child to its younger sib­lings and the con­tempt of the fra­tern­ity brother to the pledge, to the im­mig­ra­tion laws which ex­clude all non-Europeans in so­cial demo­cratic Aus­tralia, all the way to the Fas­cist ex­term­in­a­tion of ra­cial minor­it­ies, wherein in fact warmth and snug­ness ex­plode into noth­ing­ness. It is not only, as Ni­et­z­sche knew, that all good things were once evil: even the most tender of these, left to its own mo­mentum, has the tend­ency to cul­min­ate in un­think­able bar­bar­ity.]{.calibre3}

[It would be idle to try to point out a path lead­ing out of such en­tan­gle­ment. Yet the bale­ful mo­ment can be named, which brings this en­tire dia­lectic into play. It lies in the ex­clus­ive char­ac­ter of what is first. The ori­ginal re­la­tion­ship, in its mere im­me­di­acy, already pre­sup­poses that ab­stract tem­poral or­der. The concept of time is his­tor­ic­ally formed on the basis of the so­cial or­der of prop­erty. But the de­sire for own­er­ship re­flects time as fear of los­ing, of ir­re­trievab­il­ity. What is, is ex­per­i­enced in re­la­tion to its pos­sible non-be­ing. It is thereby turned into a pos­ses­sion and pre­cisely in such pet­ri­fic­a­tion to some­thing func­tional, which can be ex­changed for an­other, equi­val­ent pos­ses­sion. Once be­come en­tirely a pos­ses­sion, the be­loved hu­man be­ing is ac­tu­ally no longer even looked at. Ab­strac­tion in love is the com­ple­ment of ex­clus­iv­ity, which mani­fests it­self de­cept­ively, as its op­pos­ite, as the cling­ing to the ap­pear­ance of someone-just-so. The ob­ject of this con­ven­tion­al­ism slips out of the lat­ter's hands, pre­cisely be­cause it is turned into an ob­ject, and for­feits the hu­man be­ings, which it de­grades to "my people." If hu­man be­ings were no longer pos­ses­sions of any kind, then they could also no longer be ex­changed. The true af­fec­tion would be one, which speaks spe­cific­ally to the other, hold­ing fast to be­loved traits and not to the idol of per­son­al­ity, the mir­ror-re­flec­tion of pos­ses­sion. What is spe­cific is not ex­clus­ive: it lacks the im­pulse to­wards to­tal­ity. But in an­other sense it is nev­er­the­less ex­clus­ive: it pre­vents the sub­sti­tu­tion of the ex­per­i­ence which is in­dis­sol­ubly bound to it, not so by for­bid­ding such, but be­cause its pure concept pre­vents this sub­sti­tu­tion from hap­pen­ing in the first place. The pro­tec­tion of what is en­tirely de­term­in­ate is that it can­not be re­peated, and that is why it tol­er­ates the other. The prop­erty re­la­tion­ship in hu­man be­ings, the ex­clus­ive right of pri­or­ity, re­calls to mind the old say­ing: Lord, they\'re only hu­man be­ings, which one, doesn't really mat­ter. The af­fec­tion which knows noth­ing of such wis­dom, need not fear in­fi­del­ity, be­cause it would be im­mune to faith­less­ness.]{.calibre3}

### [50]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

[Gaps]{.calibre22}[. -- The de­mand that one should be in­tel­lec­tu­ally hon­est amounts mostly to the sab­ot­age of thought. It means to hold au­thors ac­count­able, to ex­pli­citly por­tray all the steps which led them to their con­clu­sion, and thus en­able every reader to fol­low the pro­cess along and, where pos­sible -- for ex­ample, in aca­demia -- to du­plic­ate it. Not only does this op­er­ate ac­cord­ing to the lib­eral fic­tion of the pop­u­lar, gen­eral com­mu­nic­ab­il­ity of every thought and in­hibit its fac­tu­ally ap­pro­pri­ate ex­pres­sion, but is also false as a prin­ciple of rep­res­ent­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Darstel­lung]{.calibre22}[\]. For the worth of a thought is meas­ured by its dis­tance from the con­tinu­ity of what is fa­mil­iar. It is ob­ject­ively de­val­ued by the di­minu­tion of this dis­tance; the more it ap­proaches the pre­vi­ously es­tab­lished norms, the more its an­ti­thet­ical func­tion dis­ap­pears, and its claim is foun­ded only in the lat­ter, in the ap­par­ent re­la­tion­ship to its op­pos­ite, not in its isol­ated ex­ist­ence. Texts which anxiously un­der­take to doc­u­ment every last one of their steps, de­cay un­avoid­ably into what is banal and into a bore­dom which relates not just to the ten­sion dur­ing the read­ing, but also to its own sub­stance. Sim­mel's texts, for ex­ample, suf­fer every­where from the in­com­pat­ib­il­ity of their dis­tinct­ive ob­jects with the pain­fully lu­cid treat­ment. They es­tab­lish what is dis­tinct­ive as the true com­ple­ment of that me­diocrity which Sim­mel wrongly be­lieved to be Goethe's secret. But far bey­ond this, the de­mand for in­tel­lec­tual hon­esty is it­self dis­hon­est. Even if one fol­lowed for once the du­bi­ous in­struc­tion, that the rep­res­ent­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Darstel­lung]{.calibre22}[\] ought to model it­self pre­cisely on the thought-pro­cess, then this pro­cess would no more be one of dis­curs­ive pro­gress from step to step, as the re­verse, that in­sights fall to the seeker of know­ledge from heaven. Cog­niz­ing in­volves on the con­trary a net­work of pre­ju­dices, in­tu­itions, in­nerv­a­tions, self-cor­rec­tions, as­sump­tions and ex­ag­ger­a­tions, in short in dense, groun­ded ex­per­i­ence, which is by no means trans­par­ent in all places. Of this the Cartesian rule, that one should only turn to ob­jects, "to whose clear and un­doubted know­ledge our mind \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] seems to suf­fice," in­clud­ing all or­der and dis­pos­i­tion which relates to such, gives as false an ac­count as the op­pos­ing doc­trine of the ap­per­cep­tion \[]{.calibre3}[We­senschau]{.calibre22}[\], which is nev­er­the­less in­ex­tric­ably en­twined with the former. If this lat­ter denies what is lo­gic­ally right, which in spite of everything val­id­ates it­self in every thought, then the former takes what is lo­gic­ally right in its im­me­di­acy, in re­la­tion to every in­di­vidual in­tel­lec­tual act and not as me­di­ated through the stream of the en­tire life-con­scious­ness of the cog­nizer. Therein how­ever lies sim­ul­tan­eously a con­fes­sion of deep­est in­ad­equacy. For if the hon­est thought un­avoid­ably amounts to mere re­pe­ti­tion -- whether of what is already known, or of cat­egor­ical forms -- the one which re­nounces the full trans­par­ency of its lo­gical gen­esis for the sake of the re­la­tion­ship to its ob­ject, al­ways in­curs a cer­tain guilt. It breaks the prom­ise which is pos­ited with the form of the judge­ment it­self. This in­ad­equacy re­sembles that of the life-line, which runs on bent, di­ver­ted, dis­il­lu­sion­ing ac­cord­ing to its premises, and yet solely in this course, be­cause it is con­tinu­ally less than what it should be, may it por­tray un­der the given con­di­tions of ex­ist­ence an un­re­gi­men­ted one. If life ful­filled its de­term­in­a­tion straight­away, then it would for­feit the lat­ter. Who­ever died in old age and in the con­scious­ness of a guilt­less, as it were, suc­cess, would secretly be the model pu­pil, who com­pletes every grade with an in­vis­ible back­pack, without gaps. Every thought which is not idle, how­ever, re­mains marked by the im­possib­il­ity of the full le­git­im­a­tion, as we know in dreams, that there are math­em­at­ics les­sons which we miss for the sake of a bliss­ful morn­ing in bed, which can never be made up. Thought waits for the day that it is awakened by the memory of what was omit­ted, and is trans­formed into teach­ing. ]{.calibre3}

[Be­hind the mir­ror. ]{.calibre22}[First word of cau­tion for au­thors: check every text, every frag­ment, and every line to see if the cent­ral mo­tif presents it­self clearly enough. Who­ever wants to ex­press some­thing, is so car­ried away that they are driven along, without re­flect­ing on such. One is too close to the in­ten­tion, "in thought," and for­gets to say, what one wants to say.]{.calibre3}

[No im­prove­ment is too small or pid­dling to be car­ried out. Out of a hun­dred changes, a single one may ap­pear tri­fling and pedantic; to­gether they can raise the text to a new level.]{.calibre3}

[One should never stint on de­le­tions. Length doesn't mat­ter and the fear that there isn't enough there is child­ish. One shouldn't con­sider any­thing worth pre­serving, just be­cause it's writ­ten down. If sev­eral sen­tences seem to vary the same thought, this usu­ally in­dic­ates sev­eral vari­ations of some­thing the au­thor has not yet mastered. In that case one should se­lect the best for­mu­la­tion and work on it fur­ther. The toolkit \[]{.calibre3}[Tech­nik]{.calibre22}[\] of an au­thor should in­clude the ca­pa­city to re­nounce pro­duct­ive thoughts, so long as the con­struc­tion de­mands it. The wealth and en­ergy of these lat­ter ul­ti­mately come to be­ne­fit sup­pressed thoughts. Rather like the ban­quet-table, where one shouldn't eat every last crumb or drink to the dregs. Oth­er­wise one might be ac­cused of stingi­ness.]{.calibre3}

[Who­ever wants to avoid cliches, should not re­strict them­selves to words, lest one falls vic­tim to vul­gar coquetry. The great French prose of the 19th cen­tury was es­pe­cially sens­it­ive to this. In­di­vidual words are sel­dom banal: in mu­sic, too, the single tone never wears out. The worst cliches of them all are on the con­trary word-grams \[]{.calibre3}[Wort­ver­bindun­gen]{.calibre22}[\] of the sort which Karl Kraus skewered: totally and com­pletely, for bet­ter or for worse, planned and im­ple­men­ted. For in them gurgles, as it were, the slug­gish flow of stale lan­guage, pre­cisely where the au­thor should con­struct, through pre­ci­sion of ex­pres­sion, those res­ist­ances which are re­quired wherever lan­guage emerges. This ap­plies not just to word-grams but also to the con­struc­tion of en­tire forms. If a dia­lec­tician al­ways marked the dia­lect­ical re­coil \[]{.calibre3}[Um­sch­lag]{.calibre22}[\] of a thought which ad­vances bey­ond it­self by put­ting a "how­ever" \[]{.calibre3}[aber]{.calibre22}[: how­ever, but\] in front of the caesura, then the lit­er­ary schemata would pun­ish the un­schem­atic in­tent of what is be­ing dis­cussed with un­truth.]{.calibre3}

[The jungle is no sac­red grove. It is ob­lig­at­ory to re­solve dif­fi­culties which de­rive solely from the com­fort and ease of self-un­der­stand­ing. The dis­tinc­tion between the de­sire to write with a dens­ity ap­pro­pri­ate to the depth of the ob­ject, and the tempta­tion for the ab­struse and pre­ten­tious slop­pi­ness, is not auto­matic: a mis­trust­ful in­sist­ence is al­ways healthy. Pre­cisely those who wish to make no con­ces­sion to the stu­pid­ity of com­mon sense must guard them­selves against styl­ist­ic­ally drap­ing to­gether thoughts which are them­selves to be con­victed of banal­ity. Locke's plat­it­udes do not jus­tify Ham­ann's crypto­logy.]{.calibre3}

[If one has even the slight­est qualms about a com­pleted work, re­gard­less of its length, then one should take such with in­or­din­ate ser­i­ous­ness, out of all pro­por­tion to the level of rel­ev­ance which it might re­gister. The af­fect­ive in­vest­ment \[]{.calibre3}[Be­set­zung]{.calibre22}[\] in a text and van­ity tend to min­im­ize such mis­giv­ings. What is passed over with the ti­ni­est doubt, may well in­dic­ate the ob­ject­ive worth­less­ness of the whole.]{.calibre3}

[The Echter­nacher spring pro­ces­sion \[Ger­man folk parade, where march­ers move three steps for­ward and two back\] is not the course of the World-Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Welt­geist]{.calibre22}[\]; re­stric­tion and re­voc­a­tion are not the means of nar­ra­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Darstel­lungs­mit­tel]{.calibre22}[\] for dia­lectics. On the con­trary this lat­ter moves by ex­tremes and, in­stead of qual­i­fy­ing such, drives the thought through ut­ter­most con­sequence to its dia­lect­ical re­coil \[]{.calibre3}[Um­sch­lag]{.calibre22}[\]. The prudence with which one for­bids one­self to ven­ture too far with a sen­tence, is mostly only an agent of so­cial con­trol and thus of dumb­ing down.]{.calibre3}

[Skep­ti­cism against the oft-cited ob­jec­tion, that a text, a for­mu­la­tion would be "too beau­ti­ful." The rev­er­ence for the mat­ter \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[: thing, philo­sophic mat­ter\], or even for suf­fer­ing, can eas­ily ra­tion­al­ize the re­sent­ment against those who find, in the re­ified shape of lan­guage, the traces of some­thing un­bear­able, which be­falls hu­man be­ings: de­base­ment. The dream of an ex­ist­ence \[]{.calibre3}[Da­sein]{.calibre22}[: ex­ist­ence, be­ing\] without shame, to which the pas­sion for lan­guage clings, even though the lat­ter is for­bid­den to de­pict the former as con­tent, is to be ma­li­ciously strangled. The au­thor should make no dis­tinc­tion between beau­ti­ful and fac­tual \[]{.calibre3}[sach­li­chem]{.calibre22}[: fac­tual, ob­ject­ive, real­istic\] ex­pres­sion. One should neither en­trust this dis­tinc­tion to con­cerned crit­ics, nor tol­er­ate it in one­self. If one suc­ceeds in com­pletely say­ing what one means, then it is beau­ti­ful. The beauty of ex­pres­sion for its own sake is by no means "too beau­ti­ful," but or­na­mental, artsy, ugly. Yet who­ever leaves off from the pur­ity of the ex­pres­sion, un­der the pre­text of un­swervingly stat­ing the facts, thereby be­trays the mat­ter \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[\] too.]{.calibre3}

[Prop­erly worked texts are like spider webs: her­metic, con­cent­ric, trans­par­ent, well-joined and fastened. They draw everything into them­selves, whatever crawls and flies. Meta­phors, which fleet­ingly dart through them, be­come their nour­ish­ing prey. Ma­ter­i­als come fly­ing to them. The bind­ing strin­gency \[]{.calibre3}[Stich­haltigkeit]{.calibre22}[\] of a con­cep­tion is to be judged by whether its cita­tions evoke other cita­tions. Wherever the thought opens up a cell of real­ity, it must push into the next cham­ber, without an act of vi­ol­ence by the sub­ject. It vouch­safes its re­la­tion­ship to the ob­ject, as soon as other ob­jects crys­tal­lize around it. In the light that it sheds on its de­term­in­ate ob­ject, oth­ers be­gin to gleam. ]{.calibre3}

[Au­thors settle into their texts like home-dwell­ers. Just as one cre­ates dis­order by lug­ging pa­pers, books, pen­cils and doc­u­ments from one room to an­other, so too does one com­port one­self with thoughts. They be­come pieces of fur­niture, on which one sits down, feel­ing at ease or an­noyed. One strokes them ten­derly, scuffs them up, jumbles them up, moves them around, trashes them. To those who no longer have a home­land, writ­ing be­comes home. And therein one un­avoid­ably gen­er­ates, just like the fam­ily, all man­ner of house­hold lit­ter and junk. But one no longer has a shed, and it is not at all easy to sep­ar­ate one­self from cast-offs. So one pushes them to and fro, and in the end runs the risk of filling up the page with them. The ne­ces­sity to harden one­self against pity for one­self in­cludes the tech­nical ne­ces­sity, to counter the di­minu­tion of in­tel­lec­tual ten­sion with the most ex­treme watch­ful­ness, and to elim­in­ate any­thing which forms on the work like a crust or runs on mech­an­ic­ally, which per­haps at an earlier stage pro­duced, like gos­sip, the warm at­mo­sphere which en­abled it to grow, but which now re­mains fusty and stale. In the end, au­thors are not even al­lowed to be home in their writ­ing.]{.calibre3}

[Where the stork brings chil­dren from]{.calibre22}[. -- Every hu­man be­ing has an ar­che­type out of a fairy-tale, one need only look long enough. Over there a beauty asks the mir­ror, if she is the fairest of them all, like the Queen in Snow White. She who bristles and is nit­picky to death, was modeled after the goat de­scribed in the verse, "I\'m so stuffed / can't eat any more, meeeh, meeeh." A man who is sor­row­ful and yet un­bowed re­sembles the crinkled little old lady gath­er­ing wood, who meets the Good Lord without re­cog­niz­ing Him, and is blessed with bounty, be­cause she helped Him. An­other went out into the world as a fine young fel­low to make his for­tune, dis­patched a num­ber of gi­ants, but had to die non­ethe­less in New York. One walks through the wil­der­ness of the city like Little Red Rid­ing Hood and brings the grand­mother a slice of cake and a bottle of wine, yet an­other un­dresses dur­ing love-mak­ing as shame­lessly child­like as the girl with the coins like sil­ver stars. The clever one be­comes aware of his strong an­imal soul, does not wish to per­ish along with his friends, forms a group of Bre­men city mu­si­cians, leads them into the rob­bers' den, out­wits the crooks there, but wants to go back home. The frog prince, an in­cor­ri­gible snob, stares at the prin­cess with eyes of long­ing and can­not stop hop­ing that she will res­cue him.]{.calibre3}

### [53 ]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

[Tom­fool­ery. -- ]{.calibre22}[The lin­guistic habitus of Schiller is re­min­is­cent of youths who come from the bot­tom and, em­bar­rassed, be­gin to shout in high so­ci­ety, in or­der to make them­selves heard: power \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] and in­solence. The Ger­man tirade and sen­ten­tious­ness is modeled on the French ver­sion, but prac­ticed at the bar table. In their in­fin­ite and im­plac­able de­mands, the petit bour­geois hams it up, identi­fy­ing with the power they do not have, out­bid­ding it through ar­rog­ance all the way to ab­so­lute Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] and ab­so­lute hor­ror. Between the uni­ver­sal-hu­man gran­di­os­ity and sub­lim­ity -- which all ideal­ists have in com­mon, and which con­tinu­ally wishes to in­hu­manly trample on what is small as mere ex­ist­ence -- and the crude love of os­ten­ta­tion of bour­geois men of vi­ol­ence, ex­ists the most in­tim­ate un­der­stand­ing. Spir­itual gi­ants are wont to laugh in a boom­ing voice, to ex­plode, to ut­terly de­mol­ish. When they say cre­ation, then they mean the cramped will, with which they puff them­selves up and hush ques­tions: from the primacy of prac­tical reason, it was al­ways only a step to the hatred of the­ory. Such a dy­namic dwells within all ideal­istic thought-move­ments: even Hegel's im­meas­ur­able ef­fort, to heal it by it­self, be­came its vic­tim. To wish to de­rive the world in words out of a prin­ciple, is the mode of con­duct of those who would like to usurp power, in­stead of res­ist­ing such. Fit­tingly, Schiller dealt mostly with usurpers. In the clas­si­cistic ex­plan­a­tion of sov­er­eignty over nature, what is vul­gar and lesser is mirrored via as­sidu­ous neg­a­tion. Close be­hind the ideal stands life. The rose-scents of Elysium, far too vol­uble to be vouch­safed the ex­per­i­ence of a single rose, smells like the to­bacco in the func­tion­ar­ies' of­fice, and the lyr­ical back­drop of the moon was modeled on the oil-light, in whose gut­ter­ing light stu­dents slog for their ex­ams. Weak­ness pos­ing as strength has be­trayed the thought of the pre­sum­ably rising bour­geoisie to ideo­logy, even in the days it ful­min­ated against tyranny. In the in­ner­most re­cess of hu­man­ism, as its self­same soul, sur­repti­tiously rages the brute who as a Fas­cist turns the world into a prison.]{.calibre3}

### [54 ]{.calibre24} {.calibre23}

[The Rob­bers]{.calibre22}[. -- The Kan­tian Schiller is both more non-sen­su­ous as well as more sen­su­ous than Goethe: both more ab­stract as well as more en­tangled in sexu­al­ity. This lat­ter, as im­me­di­ate de­sire, turns everything into an ac­tion-ob­ject and thereby the same. "Amalia for the band" -- that is why Louise re­mains as flat as lem­on­ade. Cas­anova's wo­men, not for noth­ing iden­ti­fied with let­ters in­stead of names, are scarcely to be dis­tin­guished from each other and also not from the fig­ur­ines, which form com­plic­ated pyr­am­ids in Sade's mech­an­ical or­gan. Some­thing of such sexual bru­tal­ity, the in­ca­pa­city to make dis­tinc­tions, lives how­ever in the great spec­u­lat­ive sys­tems of ideal­ism, all im­per­at­ives to the con­trary, and chains the Ger­man Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] and Ger­man bar­bar­ism to each other. What peas­ant greed, only held in check with dif­fi­culty by the warn­ings of the priests, ad­voc­ates as autonomy in meta­phys­ics, is the right to re­duce everything in its path to its es­sence as brazenly as peas­ant con­scripts]{.calibre3}[ vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ the wo­men of the conquered city. The pure fac­tual treat­ment \[]{.calibre3}[Tath­and­lung]{.calibre22}[\] is the vi­ol­a­tion pro­jec­ted into the starry skies above. The long, con­tem­plat­ive glance, how­ever, in which hu­man be­ings and things really un­fold, is al­ways that in which the com­pul­sion to­wards the ob­ject is broken, re­flec­ted. Non-vi­ol­ent re­flec­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Be­trach­tung]{.calibre22}[\], from which all hap­pi­ness of the truth comes, has this con­di­tion, that those who re­flect do not in­cor­por­ate the ob­ject into them­selves: near­ness to dis­tance. Only be­cause Tasso, who the psy­cho­ana­lysts would call a de­struct­ive char­ac­ter, is afraid in front of the prin­cess and falls as a civ­il­ized vic­tim to the im­possib­il­ity of the im­me­di­ate, do Ad­el­heid, Klärchen and Gretchen speak the trans­par­ent, un­forced lan­guage, which makes them into al­leg­or­ies of Ur-his­tory. The ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of life in Goethe's wo­men was paid for with with­drawal, eva­sion, and more is at stake here than mere resig­na­tion be­fore the vic­tory of the so­cial or­der. The ab­so­lute op­pos­ite to this, the sym­bol of the unity of the sen­su­ous and the ab­stract, is Don Juan. When Kierkegaard says, that sen­su­al­ity is to be grasped in him as a prin­ciple, then he touches on the secret of sen­su­al­ity it­self. Its frozen glance con­tains, so long as its self-con­sti­tu­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Selb­st­bes­in­nung]{.calibre22}[\] does not arise, pre­cisely that an­onym­ity, that un­happy gen­er­al­ity, which cata­stroph­ic­ally re­pro­duces it­self in its neg­at­ive, the con­trolling sov­er­eignty of thought.]{.calibre3}

[If you\'ll per­mit me]{.calibre22}[. -- When the poet in Schnitz­ler's play ]{.calibre3}[Merry-go-Round]{.calibre22}[ ten­derly ap­proaches the coquette, por­trayed as the friendly op­pos­ite of a Pur­itan, she says, "Step off, go play the pi­ano already." She can­not be un­aware of the pur­pose of the ar­range­ment, nor does she ac­tu­ally res­ist. Her im­pulse goes deeper than con­ven­tional or psy­cho­lo­gical pro­hib­i­tions. It evinces ar­chaic fri­gid­ity, the fear of the fe­male an­imal of re­pro­duc­tion, which in­flicts noth­ing but pain. Pleas­ure is a late achieve­ment, scarcely older than con­scious­ness. If one ob­serves how an­im­als com­puls­ively cop­u­late, as if un­der a spell, then one sees through the pro­verb "Bliss was given even to the worm" as a piece of ideal­istic ly­ing, at least where fe­males are con­cerned, who en­counter love in un­free­dom, and who are re­cog­nized only as ob­jects of vi­ol­ence. Some­thing of this has re­mained in wo­men, es­pe­cially those of the petty bour­geoisie, well into the late in­dus­trial era. The memory of the old in­jury still lives on, while the phys­ical pain and the im­me­di­ate fear have been re­moved by civil­iz­a­tion. So­ci­ety con­tinu­ally throws the de­voted­ness of the fe­male back to the situ­ation of sac­ri­fice, from which it eman­cip­ated wo­men. No man, so long as he is not com­pletely in­sens­it­ive, who is lob­by­ing a poor wo­man to come along with him, can mis­take the un­der­tone of justice in her res­ist­ance, the sole prerog­at­ive which pat­ri­archal so­ci­ety ac­cords to wo­men, who, once per­suaded, end up pay­ing the bill after the brief tri­umph of the "no." She knows that she, as the pro­vider since time im­me­morial, is sim­ul­tan­eously the one who is be­trayed. If for that reason she is out only for her­self, then she will be be­trayed that much more. This is ap­par­ent in the ad­vice to the novice, which Wede­kind puts into the words of the ma­dame of a brothel: "There is only one way to be happy in this world, and that is to do everything to make oth­ers as happy as pos­sible." One's own pleas­ure has as a pre­requis­ite the bound­less throw­ing of one­self away, which wo­men, due to their ar­chaic fear, are no more cap­able of than men in their puffed-up self-im­port­ance. Not merely the ob­ject­ive pos­sib­il­ity -- also the sub­ject­ive ca­pa­city for hap­pi­ness lies only in free­dom.]{.calibre3}

It is the same kind as the frozen sim­il­ar­ity of the flash­bulb snap­shots of fam­ily mem­bers in 19th cen­tury al­bums. Isn't Fid­gety Philip truly what ]{.calibre3}[Ghosts]{.calibre22}[ say it is, a fam­ily drama? Doesn't "and Mother gazed in si­lence rare / by the table, nose in air" de­scribe the man­ner of bank dir­ector Bork­mann's wife? How else to ex­plain Au­gus­tus' con­sumptive ill­ness than as the sins of his father and the in­her­ited memory of guilt? Furi­ous Fre­d­er­ick is pre­scribed bit­ter but heal­ing medi­cine by that en­emy of the people, Doc­tor Stock­mann, who in re­turn donates his liver-saus­age to the dog. Dan­cing little Har­riet with the matches is a touched-up pho­to­graph of the small Hilda Wan­gel from the time that her step-mother, the wo­man of the sea, left her alone in the house, and Fly­ing Robert high over the church steeple is her self­same build­ing con­tractor. And what else does Johnny Head-in-air want than the sun? Who else could have lured him into the wa­ter than Little Ey­olf's Rat-Wife, cut out of the same cloth as the red-legged Scis­sor Man? The strict poet how­ever be­haves like tall Nich­olas \[also called Ag­rippa in some trans­la­tions of Hoff­man, a school­mas­ter who dunks three mis­be­hav­ing stu­dents into an ink-pot\], who dunks the chil­dren's pic­tures of mod­ern­ity into his great bar­rel of ink, black­en­ing them with their pre­his­tory, pulling them to and fro like quiv­er­ing ma­ri­on­ettes, and in such a man­ner hold­ing a day of judg­ment over him­self.]{.calibre3}

[Ex­cav­a­tion]{.calibre22}[. -- As soon as Ib­sen's name is dropped, there is a cry that he and his ob­jects are out­moded and ob­sol­ete. These are the same types who were en­raged sixty years ago about what was mod­ern­ist­ic­ally ali­en­at­ing and un­eth­ic­ally ex­tra­vag­ant \[]{.calibre3}[Ver­stie­gene]{.calibre22}[\] about Nora \[in ]{.calibre3}[Doll's House]{.calibre22}[\] and ]{.calibre3}[Ghosts]{.calibre22}[. Ib­sen, the splen­etic bour­geois \[]{.calibre3}[Bür­ger]{.calibre22}[: bour­geois, cit­izen\], ven­ted his spleen at so­ci­ety, bor­row­ing his im­placab­il­ity and ideals from the lat­ter's own prin­ciple. He painted the por­trait of those dep­u­tized as the solid ma­jor­ity, who shouted down the en­emy of the people, as a pathetic but en­dur­ing monu­ment, and to this day they are still not flattered. That is why they move on to the busi­ness of the day. Where reas­on­able people are united over the be­ha­vior of the un­reas­on­able, one can al­ways pre­sume some­thing dis­placed and not yet worked through, pain­ful scars. Thus it is with the wo­man ques­tion. In fact this is su­per­fi­cially no longer "acute," due to the dis­sol­u­tion of the "mas­cu­line\"-lib­eral com­pet­it­ive eco­nomy, the par­ti­cip­a­tion of wo­men in salar­ied oc­cu­pa­tions where they are as in­de­pend­ently de­pend­ent as men, the dis­en­chant­ment of the fam­ily and the loosen­ing of sexual ta­boos. At the same time, how­ever, the con­tinu­ation of tra­di­tional so­ci­ety has warped the eman­cip­a­tion of wo­men. Few things are more symp­to­matic of the de­cay of the work­ers' move­ment than its fail­ure to no­tice this. The ad­mis­sion of wo­men to all pos­sible su­per­vised activ­it­ies hides the per­petu­ation of their de­hu­man­iz­a­tion. They re­main in large firms what they were in the fam­ily, ob­jects. One must think not only about their im­pov­er­ished daily grind at work and their life at home, which counter-in­tu­it­ively pre­serves craft-era work­ing con­di­tions in the midst of in­dus­trial ones, but about wo­men them­selves. Will­ingly, without any con­trary im­pulse, they re­flect dom­in­a­tion and identify with it. In­stead of solv­ing the wo­man ques­tion, mas­cu­line so­ci­ety has ex­ten­ded its own prin­ciple to the point that its vic­tims are not even cap­able of rais­ing the ques­tion any­more. No sooner are they gran­ted a cer­tain meas­ure of wealth, than they en­thu­si­ast­ic­ally af­firm their fate, leave think­ing to the men, de­fame every re­flec­tion as an af­front to the fem­in­ine ideal propag­ated by the cul­ture-in­dustry and above all leave them­selves in the un­free­dom, which they hold to be the ful­fill­ment of their gender. The de­fects by which they have to pay for this, above all neur­otic stu­pid­ity, con­trib­ute to the per­petu­ation of the con­di­tion. Already in Ib­sen's time, most wo­men with bour­geois pre­ten­sions were ready to tear into the hys­ter­ical sis­ters, who for their part took upon them­selves the hope­less at­tempt to break out of the prison of so­ci­ety, which turned all four walls against them so un­feel­ingly. The grand-daugh­ters how­ever would tol­er­antly smile at the hys­ter­ical ones, without feel­ing them­selves af­fected, and refer them to the proper au­thor­it­ies for friendly treat­ment. The fe­male hys­teric, who wished for the mi­ra­cu­lous, is suc­ceeded by the ra­ging, in­dus­tri­ous block­head, who can­not wait for the tri­umph of calam­ity. -- Per­haps some­thing sim­ilar is at work in everything which is out­moded. It is to be ex­plained not by mere tem­poral dis­tance, but as the judg­ment of his­tory. Its ex­pres­sion in things is the shame welling up in those born later, when con­fron­ted with an earlier pos­sib­il­ity which the lat­ter failed to bring to life. What was achieved, may be for­got­ten and pre­served in the present. Only what failed is al­ways out­moded, the broken prom­ise of some­thing new. It is not for noth­ing that Ib­sen's wo­men are called "mod­ern." The hatred of mod­ern­ity and that of what is out­moded are im­me­di­ately one and the same.]{.calibre3}

How­ever, the new po­s­i­tion which rad­ical bour­geois thought as­sumed, un­der the pres­sure of its op­pon­ents, was not ex­hausted by the mere re­place­ment of ideo­lo­gical ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] by a truth which was pro­claimed with the rage of self-de­struc­tion, de­fi­antly re­bel­li­ous and ready to ca­pit­u­late. The up­ris­ing of the beau­ti­ful against bour­geois good \[]{.calibre3}[Gut]{.calibre22}[\] was an up­ris­ing against be­ne­vol­ence \[]{.calibre3}[Güte]{.calibre22}[\]. Be­ne­vol­ence is it­self the de­form­a­tion of the good. By sever­ing the eth­ical prin­ciple from the so­cial one and dis­pla­cing it into a private sens­ib­il­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Ges­in­nung]{.calibre22}[\], the former re­stric­ted the lat­ter in a double sense. Be­ne­vol­ence re­nounced the real­iz­a­tion of a con­di­tion worthy of hu­man be­ings, which was built into the eth­ical prin­ciple. Each one of its ac­tions is in­scribed with con­sol­ing resig­na­tion: it aims at al­le­vi­ation, not heal­ing, and in the end the con­scious­ness of in­cur­ab­il­ity forms a pact with such. Be­ne­vol­ence thereby be­comes re­stric­ted even in it­self. Its guilt con­sists of trust­ful­ness. It mir­rors the im­me­di­ate re­la­tions between hu­man be­ings and leaps over the dis­tance by which alone in­di­vidu­als can pro­tect them­selves against be­com­ing touched by the gen­er­al­ity. It is pre­cisely in the most in­tim­ate con­tact that they ex­per­i­ence the non-sub­lated dif­fer­ence most pain­fully. Only ali­en­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Frem­d­heit]{.calibre22}[: for­eignness\] is the an­ti­dote to ali­en­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Ent­frem­dung]{.calibre22}[\]. The eph­em­eral pic­ture of har­mony, in which be­ne­vol­ence de­lights, only ex­acer­bates the suf­fer­ing of ir­re­con­cil­ab­il­ity, the more it idi­ot­ic­ally denies the lat­ter. The af­front against taste and con­sid­er­a­tion, from which no good act is ex­empt, com­pletes the lev­el­ing, which the power­less uto­pia of the beau­ti­ful op­poses. From the be­gin­nings of ma­ture in­dus­trial so­ci­ety, the al­le­gi­ance to evil was not only the pre­cursor of bar­bar­ism, but also a mask of the good. Its dig­nity passed over to evil, by draw­ing all hatred and all re­sent­ment of the so­cial or­der to it­self, an or­der which drilled the good into its mem­bers, so that it could be evil without pun­ish­ment. When Hedda Ga­bler mor­tally em­bar­rassed Aunt Ju­lle, who meant only the very best, when she in­ten­tion­ally de­clared that the dread­ful hat which the aunt ac­quired to honor the gen­eral's daugh­ter be­longed to the maid, then the dis­sat­is­fied one did not merely sad­ist­ic­ally vent her hate against the cloy­ing bonds of mar­riage on a de­fense­less per­son. Rather she sins against what is the best, in what she has to do, be­cause she re­cog­nizes in the best the shame of the good. She rep­res­ents, against the old wo­man who ad­ores the dim-wit­ted nephew, un­con­sciously and ab­surdly, the ab­so­lute. Hedda is the vic­tim and not Ju­lle. The beau­ti­ful, whose fixed idea dom­in­ates Hedda, op­poses eth­ics \[]{.calibre3}[Moral]{.calibre22}[\] even be­fore scorn­ing such. For it digs in its heels against every gen­er­al­ity and pos­its the dif­fer­en­tial de­term­in­a­tion of mere ex­ist­ence ab­so­lutely, as the con­tin­gency which al­lows for one thing but not an­other. The opaque par­tic­u­lar­ity main­tains it­self as the norm in the beau­ti­ful, as some­thing solely gen­eral, be­cause the nor­mal gen­er­al­ity has be­come all too trans­par­ent. Thus it casts down its chal­lenge to the lat­ter, the equal­ity of everything which is un­free. But it be­comes thereby guilty it­self, by once more sever­ing, along with the gen­er­al­ity, also the pos­sib­il­ity of go­ing bey­ond that mere ex­ist­ence, whose opa­city merely mir­rors the un­truth of the bad gen­er­al­ity. Thus the beau­ti­ful does in­justice to justice and is nev­er­the­less jus­ti­fied in do­ing so. In the beau­ti­ful, the frail fu­ture of­fers its sac­ri­fice to the Mo­loch of the con­tem­por­ary: be­cause there can be noth­ing good in the lat­ter's realm, the former makes it­self bad, in or­der to con­vict the judge from the po­s­i­tion of the van­quished. The ob­jec­tion of the beau­ti­ful against the good is the sec­u­lar­ized, bour­geois form of the de­lu­sion of the hero in clas­sical tragedy. In the im­man­ence of so­ci­ety, the con­scious­ness of its neg­at­ive es­sence is locked away, and only the con­crete neg­a­tion stands in for the truth. Anti-eth­ics, by re­ject­ing what is un­eth­ical in eth­ics, as re­pres­sion, sim­ul­tan­eously makes the lat­ter's in­ner­most con­cern its own: that every form of vi­ol­ence ought to van­ish, along with every re­stric­tion. That is why in fact the motives of un­com­prom­ising bour­geois self-cri­tique con­verge with the ma­ter­i­al­ist kind, which brings the former to con­scious­ness of it­self.]{.calibre3}

[Since I saw him]{.calibre22}[. -- The fe­male char­ac­ter and the ideal of fem­in­in­ity on which it is modeled are products of mas­cu­line so­ci­ety. The pic­ture of un­dis­tor­ted nature ori­gin­ates first in dis­tor­tion, as its op­pos­ite. There, where it claims to be hu­mane, mas­cu­line so­ci­ety sov­er­eignly breeds in wo­men their own cor­rect­ive and thereby shows it­self through this re­stric­tion as the im­plac­able mas­ter. The fe­male char­ac­ter is the im­print of the pos­it­ive one of dom­in­a­tion. But for that reason just as bad as the lat­ter. What gen­er­ally passes for nature in the bour­geois con­text of de­lu­sion is merely the scar tis­sue of mu­til­a­tion. If the psy­cho­ana­lytic the­ory holds, that wo­men per­ceive their phys­ical con­sti­tu­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Beschaf­fen­heit]{.calibre22}[\] as the con­sequence of cas­tra­tion, then in their neur­osis they in­tuit the truth. Those who feel them­selves to be wounds when they bleed, know more about them­selves than those who style them­selves as flowers, be­cause that's what their hus­band likes. The lie is not merely that nature is af­firmed, where it is merely tol­er­ated and built in, but that what passes for nature in civil­iz­a­tion is ac­cord­ing to its sub­stance the most re­moved from everything nat­ural, the pure turn­ing of one­self into an ob­ject. The kind of fem­in­in­ity which calls upon the in­stincts, is in­vari­ably the one to which every wo­man must com­pel her­self with all man­ner of vi­ol­ence -- with mas­cu­line vi­ol­ence: the little wo­men are little men. One need only have ex­per­i­enced once, in the pangs of jeal­ousy, how such fe­male wo­men ac­cess their fem­in­in­ity, de­ploy­ing it where ne­ces­sary, mak­ing their eyes flash, fuel­ing their mood swings, in or­der to know what the sheltered un­con­scious, un­scathed by the in­tel­lect, really amounts to. It is pre­cisely its pristine­ness and pur­ity which is the achieve­ment of the ego, of cen­sor­ship, of the in­tel­lect, and for that reason it ad­justs it­self without any con­flict into the real­ity-prin­ciple of the ra­tional so­cial or­der. Without a single ex­cep­tion, fe­male natures con­form. That Ni­et­z­sche's in­sist­ence stopped at this point, by ad­opt­ing an un­ex­amined and un­versed pic­ture of fem­in­ine nature from the Chris­tian civil­iz­a­tion which he oth­er­wise so thor­oughly mis­trus­ted, ul­ti­mately al­lowed bour­geois so­ci­ety to sub­jug­ate the ef­fort of his thought. He fell prey to the fraud of say­ing "wo­man," \[]{.calibre3}[Weib]{.calibre22}[: wo­man, wench\] when he spoke of wo­men \[]{.calibre3}[Frau]{.calibre22}[: wo­man, wife, Mrs.\]. Thus the per­fi­di­ous ad­vice to not for­get the whip: the wo­man \[]{.calibre3}[Weib]{.calibre22}[\] is already the ef­fect of the whip. It would be the eman­cip­a­tion of nature to ab­ol­ish its self-pos­it­ing. The glor­i­fic­a­tion of the fe­male char­ac­ter im­plies the de­grad­a­tion of all who bear it.]{.calibre3}

[A word for eth­ics.]{.calibre22}[ \[]{.calibre3}[Moral]{.calibre22}[: eth­ics, mor­al­ity\] -- The amor­al­ism, with which Ni­et­z­sche dressed down the old un­truths, has fallen prey to the ver­dict of his­tory. With the dis­sol­u­tion of re­li­gion and its tan­gible philo­soph­ical sec­u­lar­iz­a­tions, the re­strict­ing pro­hib­i­tions have lost their cer­ti­fied es­sence, their sub­stan­ti­al­ity. At one time how­ever ma­ter­ial pro­duc­tion was still so un­der­developed, that there were grounds for an­noun­cing that there wasn't enough for every­one. Who­ever did not cri­ti­cize polit­ical eco­nomy as such, was forced to cling to the lim­it­ing prin­ciple sub­sequently ex­pressed as un­ra­tion­al­ized ap­pro­pri­ation at the cost of the weak. The ob­ject­ive pre­requis­ites for this have changed. In view of the im­me­di­ate pos­sib­il­ity of abund­ance, this lim­it­a­tion must seem su­per­flu­ous not just to so­cial non-con­form­ists, but even to the lim­ited minds of bour­geois cit­izens. The im­pli­cit sense of the eth­ics of the rulers, that who­ever wants to live has to grab what they can, has mean­while turned into even more of a wretched lie than when it was the pul­pit wis­dom of the 19th cen­tury. If in Ger­many the up­stand­ing cit­izens \[]{.calibre3}[Spiess­bür­ger]{.calibre22}[\] have proven them­selves to be blond beasts, then this is not on ac­count of na­tional pe­cu­li­ar­it­ies, but due to the fact that in the face of open plen­it­ude, the blond beast it­self, so­cial rob­bery, has taken on the as­pect of some­thing back­woodsy, of the de­luded phil­istine, and even of the "short-end-of-the-stick" at­ti­tude, against which the rul­ing eth­ics was in­ven­ted. If Cesare Bor­gia came back to life today, he would re­semble David Fre­drich Strauss and he would be named Ad­olf Hitler. The preach­ing of amor­al­ity has be­come the task of the same Dar­win­ists who Ni­et­z­sche loathed, and who con­vuls­ively pro­claimed the bar­baric struggle for ex­ist­ence as a maxim, pre­cisely be­cause it is no longer needed. The vir­tue of gen­til­ity has long since ceased to mean the tak­ing what is bet­ter from oth­ers, but means in­stead be­com­ing sa­ti­ated with tak­ing and really prac­ti­cing the vir­tue of giv­ing, some­thing which oc­curs in Ni­et­z­sche solely in­tel­lec­tu­ally. The as­cetic ideals com­prise a greater de­gree of res­ist­ance against the mad­ness of the profit eco­nomy today than lav­ish liv­ing did sixty years ago against lib­eral re­pres­sion. Amor­al­ists may fi­nally per­mit them­selves to be as be­ne­vol­ent, kind, un­e­go­istic and open-minded as Ni­et­z­sche already was at that time. As a guar­an­tee of their un­yield­ing res­ist­ance, they will still re­main as lonely as in the days when he turned the mask of evil against the nor­mal world, in or­der to teach the norm to fear its own wrong­ness.]{.calibre3}

[Court of ap­peal]{.calibre22}[. -- Ni­et­z­sche ex­pressed in ]{.calibre3}[The An­ti­christ]{.calibre22}[ the strongest ar­gu­ment not merely against theo­logy, but also against meta­phys­ics: that it con­fuses hope with truth; that the im­possib­il­ity of think­ing, liv­ing hap­pily or liv­ing at all without some­thing ab­so­lute, does not testify to the le­git­im­acy of that thought. He re­buts the Chris­tian "proof by ef­fic­acy," that be­lief is truth, be­cause it brings bliss. For "isn't blessed­ness -- tech­nic­ally ex­pressed, pleas­ure -- al­ways a proof of ef­fic­acy? So little, that it al­most proves the con­trary, yield­ing in any case the highest sus­pi­cion against the 'truth', if feel­ings of pleas­ure have any­thing to say to the ques­tion of 'what is true'. The proof of 'pleas­ure' is proof of 'pleas­ure' -- noth­ing more; how in the world can it be es­tab­lished, that it is pre­cisely true judg­ments which are more pleas­ur­able than false ones and, ac­cord­ing to a pre-es­tab­lished har­mony, ne­ces­sar­ily draw pleas­ant feel­ings after them?" (]{.calibre3}[The An­ti­christ]{.calibre22}[, Aph­or­ism 50). But Ni­et­z­sche him­self taught ]{.calibre3}[amor fati]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: love of fate\], "you should love your des­tiny." This lat­ter, ac­cord­ing to the epi­logue of the ]{.calibre3}[Twi­light of the Gods]{.calibre22}[, is his in­ner­most nature. And it is worth ask­ing the ques­tion as to whether there is any more reason to love what one en­coun­ters, to ex­tol that which ex­ists, be­cause it is, than for con­sid­er­ing as true what one hopes for. Is it not the same faulty con­clu­sion, which leads from the ex­ist­ence of "stub­born facts" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] to their in­stall­a­tion as the highest value, which he re­proaches in the trans­ition from hope to truth? If he dis­patches "blessed­ness through a fixed idea" to the in­sane asylum, then one could seek out the ori­gin of ]{.calibre3}[amor fati]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: love of fate\] in the prison. Those who no longer see or have any­thing else to love, fall vic­tim to the love of stone walls and barred win­dows. Both in­stances are ruled by the same ig­no­miny of ad­apt­a­tion, which, in or­der to be able to en­dure the hor­ror of the world, ascribes the wish to real­ity and mean­ing to non­sense of com­pul­sion. No less than in ]{.calibre3}[credo quia]{.calibre22}[ ab­surdum \[Latin: be­lief unto ab­surdity\], re­nun­ci­ation crawls in ]{.calibre3}[amor fati]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: love of fate\], the glor­i­fic­a­tion of what is most ab­surd of them all, from dom­in­a­tion to the cross. In the end, hope, which eludes real­ity by neg­at­ing it, is the sole shape in which the truth ap­pears. Without hope the idea of truth would scarcely be think­able, and it is the car­dinal un­truth, to pass off the ex­ist­ence which is re­cog­nized as bad as the truth, if only be­cause it was once re­cog­nized. Here, rather than the op­pos­ite, is where the crime of theo­logy lies, which Ni­et­z­sche pro­sec­uted without ever reach­ing the fi­nal court. In one of the most power­ful mo­ments of his cri­tique he ac­cused Chris­tian­ity of myth­o­logy: "The sac­ri­fi­cial vic­tim, and in­deed in its most re­puls­ive, bar­baric form, the sac­ri­fice of the in­no­cent for the sins of the guilty! What ghastly pa­gan­ism!" (]{.calibre3}[The An­ti­christ]{.calibre22}[, Aph­or­ism 41). Yet the love of des­tiny is noth­ing other than the ab­so­lute sanc­tion­ing of the in­fin­ity of such sac­ri­fice. Mythos sep­ar­ates Ni­et­z­sche's cri­tique of myth from the truth.]{.calibre3}

By serving as a pre­text for envy, be­cause a vain mo­ment ne­ces­sar­ily ap­pears in all Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] as soon as it por­trays it­self, the grounds for the em­bar­rass­ment be­comes clear. It is due to what is con­tem­plat­ive, the giv­ing of time to one­self, the homily, how­ever many times in­ter­rup­ted, the in­dul­gently raised fore­finger. The crit­ical con­tent of the thought is denied by the ges­ture of ban­dy­ing one­self about, fa­mil­iar to pro­fess­ors sine­cured by the state, and the irony, with which the stage actor of Voltaire con­fesses on his title page to his mem­ber­ship in the Académie Française \[French Academy\], re­coils back onto the comedian. In his es­say, some­thing vi­ol­ent is con­cealed in all the freighted hu­man­ity: one can af­ford to speak so, be­cause no-one in­ter­rupts the mas­ter. Some­thing of the usurp­a­tion which dwells within all lec­tur­ing and in­deed all read­ing aloud, has per­meated the lu­cid con­struc­tion of the peri­ods, which re­serve so much leis­ure for the most un­com­fort­able things. An un­mis­tak­able sign of lat­ent con­tempt for hu­man be­ings in the last ad­voc­ate of hu­man dig­nity is the daunt­less­ness with which he ex­presses plat­it­udes, as if no-one dared to no­tice them: "]{.calibre3}[L\'artist doit aimer la vie et nous montrer qu\'elle est belle. Sans lui, nous en douterions]{.calibre22}[." \[French: Artists should love life and show us that it is beau­ti­ful. Without them, we should doubt it.\] What steps for­wards in the ar­cha­ic­ally styl­ized med­it­a­tions of France, already secretly marks every med­it­a­tion, which claims the prerog­at­ive of with­draw­ing from the im­me­di­acy of pur­pose. Equan­im­ity as such turns into the same lie, which the haste of im­me­di­acy falls vic­tim to any­way. While thought, ac­cord­ing to its con­tent, strives against the ir­res­ist­ibly rising tide of hor­ror, the nerves, the sense-or­gan of his­tor­ical con­scious­ness, are cap­able of de­tect­ing the trace of un­der­stand­ing with the world, even if it is only that it is per­miss­ible to be a thought, which one already con­cedes in the mo­ment that one steps far enough back from it, in or­der to turn it into a philo­soph­ical ob­ject. The sov­er­eignty, without which no think­ing could be, hails the priv­ilege which per­mits one to do so. The aver­sion against this has well-nigh be­come the most dif­fi­cult obstacle to the­ory: if one fol­lows up on it, then one would have to fall si­lent, and if one does not fol­low up on it, then one be­comes ob­tuse and cret­in­ous through trust in one's own cul­ture. Even the hor­rid di­vi­sion of speak­ing into oc­cu­pa­tional con­ver­sa­tions and strictly con­ven­tional ones yields an ink­ling of the im­possib­il­ity of say­ing some­thing thought without ar­rog­ance, without vi­ol­at­ing the time of the other. It is the most ur­gent task of a mode of nar­ra­tion, which ought to hold true at a min­imum, that it does not look away from such ex­per­i­ences, but brings them to ex­pres­sion through tempo, com­pact­ness, dens­ity, and yet also by be­ing non-bind­ing \[]{.calibre3}[Un­ver­bind­lich­keit]{.calibre22}[\]. ]{.calibre3}

[Death of im­mor­tal­ity]{.calibre22}[. -- Flaubert, who went on re­cord say­ing he loathed the fame to which he ded­ic­ated his life, had it as good in the con­scious­ness of such a con­tra­dic­tion as the sed­ate bour­geois who wrote Ma­dame Bo­vary. In re­gards to cor­rupt pub­lic opin­ion, the press, to which he re­acted like Kraus, he thought he could rely on pos­ter­ity, a bour­geoisie eman­cip­ated from the bale­ful spell of stu­pid­ity, which would duly honor its au­then­tic critic. But he un­der­es­tim­ated stu­pid­ity: the so­ci­ety which he rep­res­en­ted can­not name it­self, and with its de­vel­op­ment into a to­tal­ity, in­tel­li­gence has de­veloped ab­so­lutely along with stu­pid­ity. This eats away at the power-cen­ters of in­tel­lec­tu­als. He may not even hope for pos­ter­ity without fall­ing prey to con­form­ism, be it merely the agree­ment with great minds \[]{.calibre3}[Geistern]{.calibre22}[\]. How­ever as soon as he re­nounces such hope, an ele­ment of some­thing de­lu­sional and pig-headed enters his work, bor­der­ing on a re­coil into cyn­ical ca­pit­u­la­tion. Fame, which had some­thing ac­ci­dental and stagey about it, and yet also a glim­mer of justice and free choice, has been li­quid­ated as the res­ult of the ob­ject­ive pro­cesses of the mar­ket so­ci­ety. It has en­tirely be­come a func­tion of paid pro­pa­ganda-bur­eaus and is meas­ured in terms of the in­vest­ment be­ing wagered by the name-bearer or in­terest-group which stands be­hind it. The paid flacks, who still ap­peared to Daumier as an ex­cres­cence, have mean­while shed their dis­rep­ut­ab­il­ity and be­come of­fi­cial ap­pointees of the cul­tural sys­tem. Au­thors who want a ca­reer speak as openly about their agents as their pre­de­cessors did about pub­lish­ers, who also knew a thing or two about ad­vert­ising. One takes con­trol of the pro­cess of be­com­ing fam­ous and thereby to a cer­tain de­gree also their after-life -- for what has a chance of be­ing re­membered in a thor­oughly or­gan­ized so­ci­ety, which is not already fa­mil­iar -- and pur­chases the ex­pect­a­tion of im­mor­tal­ity, only no longer from the church, but hence­forth from the lack­eys of trusts. But there is no bless­ing therein. Just as ca­pri­cious memory and ut­ter ob­li­vion al­ways went to­gether, so too does the planned dis­pos­i­tion of fame and me­mori­al­iz­a­tion lead ir­res­ist­ibly into noth­ing­ness, whose fore­taste can already be dis­cerned in the hec­tic es­sence of all celebrity. The fam­ous are not happy. They turn them­selves into brand-name art­icles, alien and in­com­pre­hens­ible to them­selves; as liv­ing pic­tures of them­selves, they are like the dead. In the pre­ten­tious con­cern for their aura they waste the sub­stant­ive en­ergy, which alone is cap­able of per­petu­ation. The in­hu­man in­dif­fer­ence and con­tempt which is im­me­di­ately meted out to the fallen gi­ants of the cul­ture-in­dustry, re­veals the truth about their fame, without giv­ing those who par­take in scorn­ing that fame any bet­ter hope for pos­ter­ity. Thus in­tel­lec­tu­als dis­cover the frailty of their secret motives, and the only help against such is to ex­press this in­sight. ]{.calibre3}

It does not help to as­cet­ic­ally avoid all ele­ments of ex­pert dis­course, all ref­er­ences to no longer ex­ist­ing spheres of edu­ca­tion. Rather, strict­ness and pur­ity of lin­guistic ar­range­ment, even in the most ex­treme sim­pli­city, cre­ates a va­cuum. Shod­di­ness, mov­ing along with the fa­mil­iar cur­rents of lan­guage, counts as a sign of be­long­ing and con­tact: one knows what one wants, be­cause one knows what the other wants. To fo­cus on the thing in the ex­pres­sion rather than the com­mu­nic­a­tion, is con­sidered sus­pi­cious: what is spe­cific, not already hid­den away in auto­mat­ism, ap­pears in­con­sid­er­ate, a symp­tom of ec­cent­ri­city, al­most of con­fu­sion. Con­tem­por­ary lo­gic, which puts so much store on its clar­ity, has na­ively ab­sorbed such per­ver­sion in the cat­egory of col­lo­quial speech.

The strictly en­forced un­am­bigu­ous­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Eindeut­igkeit]{.calibre22}[: dir­ect­ness, de­cided­ness\] of the con­struc­tion, the ef­fort of the concept, from which hu­man be­ings are con­sciously weaned, pre­sumes the sus­pen­sion of the pre­vail­ing judg­ment be­fore all con­tent, and thereby a rad­ical sep­ar­a­tion of one­self, some­thing which they re­act vi­ol­ently to. Only that which they do not need to know counts as un­der­stand­able; only what is in truth ali­en­ated, the word mol­ded by com­merce, strikes them as trust­worthy. There are few things which con­trib­ute more to the de­mor­al­iz­a­tion of in­tel­lec­tu­als. Who­ever wishes to es­cape this, must see through every piece of ad­vice which tells one to fo­cus on com­mu­nic­a­tion as a be­trayal of what is be­ing com­mu­nic­ated.]{.calibre3}

Leis­ure, even pride and ar­rog­ance, en­dowed the speech of the up­per crust with some­thing of in­de­pend­ence and self-dis­cip­line. It is thereby brought into op­pos­i­tion to its own so­cial realm. It turns against the mas­ters, who mis­use it to com­mand, by wish­ing to com­mand them, and re­fuses to serve their in­terest. In the speech of the sub­jug­ated, how­ever, there is only the mark of dom­in­a­tion, rob­bing them even of the justice which the un­mu­til­ated, autonom­ous word means to all those who are free enough to say it without re­sent­ment. Pro­let­arian speech is dic­tated by hun­ger. The poor chew words, in or­der to feel full. From their ob­ject­ive Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] they ex­pect the power­ful nour­ish­ment, which so­ci­ety has denied them; they fill up their mouths be­cause they have noth­ing to bite on. Thus they take re­venge on lan­guage. They de­spoil the body of a lan­guage, which does not let them love it, and re­peat with power­less strength the shame which was done to them. Even what is best in the dia­lects of north­ern Ber­lin or the \[Lon­don\] Cock­neys, the street smarts and mother-wit, ails from the cir­cum­stance that in or­der to with­stand des­per­ate situ­ations without des­pair­ing, one must laugh at one­self as well as the en­emy and thus jus­tify the course of the world. If writ­ten speech co­di­fies the ali­en­a­tion of the classes, then this lat­ter is not to be re­pealed by re­gres­sion to the spoken kind, but only in the con­sequen­ti­al­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Kon­sequenz]{.calibre22}[: con­sequence, rami­fic­a­tion\] of strict­est lin­guistic ob­jectiv­ity.

[Melange]{.calibre22}[. -- The usual ar­gu­ment of tol­er­ance, that all hu­man be­ings, all races are equal, is a boom­er­ang. It opens it­self up to easy re­but­tal by the senses, and even the most com­pel­ling an­thro­po­lo­gical evid­ence for the fact that Jews are not a race at all, will in the case of a pogrom hardly change any­thing at all, since the to­tal­it­ari­ans know very well who they want to kill and who not. If one wished to pro­claim the equal­ity of all those who bear hu­man fea­tures as an ideal, in­stead of es­tab­lish­ing it as a fact, this would be of little help. The ab­stract uto­pia would be all too eas­ily re­con­cil­able with the most de­vi­ous tend­en­cies of so­ci­ety. That all hu­man be­ings would re­semble each other, is ex­actly what suits this lat­ter. It re­gards fac­tual or ima­gined dif­fer­ences as marks of shame, which re­veal, that one has not brought things far enough; that some­thing some­where has been left free of the ma­chine, is not totally de­term­ined by the to­tal­ity. The tech­nics of the con­cen­tra­tion camps was de­signed to turn pris­on­ers into guards, the murdered into mur­der­ers. Ra­cial dif­fer­ence was ab­so­lutely sub­lated, so that one could ab­ol­ish it ab­so­lutely, if only in the sense that noth­ing dif­fer­ent sur­vived any­more. An eman­cip­ated so­ci­ety how­ever would be no unit­ary state, but the real­iz­a­tion of the gen­er­al­ity in the re­con­cili­ation of dif­fer­ences. A polit­ics which took this ser­i­ously should there­fore not propag­ate even the idea of the ab­stract equal­ity of hu­man be­ings. They should rather point to the bad equal­ity of today, the iden­tity of film in­terests with weapons in­terests, and think of the bet­ter con­di­tion as the one in which one could be dif­fer­ent without fear. If one at­tested to blacks \[]{.calibre3}[Neger]{.calibre22}[\], that they are ex­actly like whites, while they are nev­er­the­less not so, then one would secretly wrong them all over again. This hu­mi­li­ates them in a be­ne­vol­ent man­ner by a stand­ard which, un­der the pres­sure of the sys­tem, they can­not at­tain, and moreover whose at­tain­ment would be a du­bi­ous achieve­ment. The spokes­per­sons of unit­ary tol­er­ance are al­ways pre­pared to turn in­tol­er­antly against any group which does not fit in: the ob­stin­ate en­thu­si­asm for blacks meshes seam­lessly with the out­rage over ob­nox­ious Jews. The "melt­ing pot" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] was an in­sti­tu­tion of free-wheel­ing in­dus­trial cap­it­al­ism.

[Un­meas­ure for un­meas­ure]{.calibre22}[. -- What the Ger­mans have com­mit­ted bey­ond com­pre­hen­sion, even the psy­cho­lo­gical kind, given that the hor­ror seems to have been per­pet­rated more as blindly planned and ali­en­ated meas­ures of ter­ror than as spon­tan­eous grat­i­fic­a­tion. Ac­cord­ing to the re­ports of eye­wit­nesses, the tor­ture and murder were car­ried out without en­thu­si­asm, and per­haps for that reason went so far bey­ond all bounds. Nev­er­the­less the con­scious­ness which would like to with­stand the un­speak­able sees it­self thrown back again and again to the at­tempt to un­der­stand, so that it does not sub­ject­ively fall prey to the mad­ness which ob­ject­ively rules. The thought ir­res­ist­ibly ob­trudes that the Ger­man hor­ror was some­thing like a re­venge taken in ad­vance. The credit sys­tem in which everything, even world con­quest, can be ad­vanced, de­term­ines also the ac­tions which pre­pared its end and the end of the en­tire mar­ket so­ci­ety, all the way to the sui­cide of the dic­tat­or­ship. In the con­cen­tra­tion camps and gas cham­bers the down­fall of Ger­many is, as it were, be­ing dis­coun­ted. No-one who ob­served the first months of Nazi rule in 1933 could over­look the mo­ment of deathly sor­row, of the half-know­ing en­trust­ing of one­self to some­thing calam­it­ous, which ac­com­pan­ied the whipped-up eu­phoria, the torch­light parades and fan­fares. How hope­less was the sound of the Ger­man fa­vor­ite song of those months, "People \[Volk\] to Arms," in the street of Unter den Linden. The sal­va­tion of the fath­er­land ar­ranged from one day to the next bore the ex­pres­sion of cata­strophe from the first mo­ment, and this cata­strophe was prac­ticed in the con­cen­tra­tion camps, while its pre­mon­i­tion was drowned out by the tri­umph in the streets. Such pre­mon­i­tion need not be ex­plained by the col­lect­ive un­con­scious, which to be sure clearly enough played a role. The Ger­man po­s­i­tion in the im­per­i­al­ist com­pet­i­tion was, ac­cord­ing to the meas­ure of avail­able raw ma­ter­i­als and in­dus­trial po­ten­tial, des­per­ate in war and peace. Every­one and yet no-one was too dumb to re­cog­nize this. To de­liver one­self to the fi­nal battle of the com­pet­i­tion, meant spring­ing into the abyss, and the oth­ers were pushed into it, in the be­lief that it could still be war­ded off. The chance of the Nazi en­ter­prise com­pens­at­ing for the dis­ad­vant­age of the total volume of pro­duc­tion through re­cord ter­ror and tem­poral pri­or­ity was tiny. The oth­ers had sooner be­lieved in this than the Ger­mans, who were not happy even with the fall of Paris. While they won everything, they already raged like those who have noth­ing left to lose. At the be­gin­ning of Ger­man im­per­i­al­ism stands Wag­ner's ]{.calibre3}[Twi­light of the Gods]{.calibre22}[, the rap­tur­ous proph­ecy of their own doom, whose com­pos­i­tion was un­der­taken sim­ul­tan­eously with the vic­tori­ous war of 1870 \[the Franco-Prus­sian War, which sealed the uni­fic­a­tion of Ger­many\]. In the same spirit, two years be­fore WW II the Ger­man pub­lic saw a film of the down­fall of their zep­pelin in Lake­hurst. Calm, poised, the ship went on its way, only to sud­denly plum­met straight down. If there re­mains no way out, then the de­struct­ive drive be­comes com­pletely in­dif­fer­ent as to what it never firmly es­tab­lished: as to whether it is dir­ec­ted against oth­ers or against its own sub­ject. ]{.calibre3}

[Hu­man be­ings look at you]{.calibre22}[. -- The out­rage over at­ro­cit­ies de­creases, the more that the ones af­fected are un­like nor­mal read­ers, the more bru­nette, "dirty," dago-like. This says just as much about the at­ro­city as about the ob­serv­ers. Per­haps the so­cial schem­at­ism of per­cep­tion in anti-Semites is so altered, that they can­not even see Jews as hu­man be­ings. The cease­lessly re­cur­rent ex­pres­sion that sav­ages, blacks, Ja­pan­ese re­semble an­im­als, or some­thing like apes, already con­tains the key to the pogrom. The pos­sib­il­ity of this lat­ter is con­tained in the mo­ment that a mor­tally wounded an­imal looks at a hu­man be­ing in the eye. The de­fi­ance with which they push away this gaze -- "it's after all only an an­imal" -- is re­peated ir­res­ist­ibly in at­ro­cit­ies to hu­man be­ings, in which the per­pet­rat­ors must con­stantly re­con­firm this "only an an­imal," be­cause they never en­tirely be­lieved it even with an­im­als. The concept of hu­man be­ings in re­press­ive so­ci­ety is the par­ody of the no­tion that hu­man be­ings were cre­ated in the im­age of God. The mech­an­ism of "pathic pro­jec­tion" func­tions in such a man­ner that the power-brokers per­ceive only their own mir­ror im­age as hu­man be­ings, in­stead of re­flect­ing back what is hu­man as pre­cisely what is dif­fer­ent. Murder is thus the at­tempt to dis­place, again and again, the mad­ness of such false per­cep­tion into reason, through greater mad­ness: what is not seen as a hu­man be­ing and yet is a hu­man be­ing, is turned into a thing, so that it can no longer re­but the manic gaze through any sort of im­pulse. ]{.calibre3}

[Little people.]{.calibre22}[ -- Those who deny ob­ject­ive his­tor­ical forces find it all too easy to ar­gue that the course of the war could have been dif­fer­ent. Ac­tu­ally the Ger­mans should have won: that they failed was the fault of the Führer's \[Leader's\] stu­pid­ity. But the de­cis­ive "stu­pid­it­ies" of Hitler, his re­fusal in the middle of the con­flict to wage war on Eng­land, his at­tack on Rus­sia and Amer­ica, have their pre­cise so­cial mean­ing, which de­veloped ir­res­ist­ibly from each seem­ingly reas­on­able step to the next un­til the cata­strophe. Even if it were, strictly speak­ing, stu­pid­ity, this re­mains his­tor­ic­ally de­term­in­able: stu­pid­ity is above all no nat­ural qual­ity, but some­thing so­cially pro­duced and so­cially amp­li­fied. The rul­ing Ger­man cliques rushed to­wards war, be­cause they were ex­cluded from the lead­ing im­per­i­al­ist po­s­i­tions of power. In this ex­clu­sion how­ever lay also the reason for that pro­vin­cial­ism, rus­ti­city and self-de­cep­tion, which made the polit­ics of Hitler and Rib­ben­trop un­com­pet­it­ive and their war a gamble. That they were so badly in­formed about the bal­ance between the gen­eral eco­nomic and spe­cific­ally Brit­ish in­terests of the Tor­ies and the strength of the Red Army as their own masses be­hind the cor­don of the Third Reich, is not to be sep­ar­ated from the his­tor­ical con­sti­tu­tion of Na­tional So­cial­ism, in­deed from its power. The win­dow of op­por­tun­ity for a cun­ning first strike con­sisted solely of the fact that they them­selves knew no bet­ter, and that was pre­cisely the reason for its fail­ure. Ger­many's in­dus­trial back­ward­ness forced the politi­cians, who wanted to catch up at a single bound and for that very reason were qual­i­fied as have-nots, back on their own nar­row ex­per­i­ence, that of the polit­ical façade. They saw noth­ing in front of them ex­cept cheer­ing crowds and frightened ne­go­ti­at­ors; this ob­scured their in­sight into the ob­ject­ive power of the greater mass of cap­ital fa­cing them. It is the im­man­ent re­venge on Hitler that he, the ex­e­cu­tioner of lib­eral cap­it­al­ist so­ci­ety, was ac­cord­ing to its own in­dex of con­scious­ness too "lib­eral" to re­cog­nize that un­der the shell of lib­er­al­ism abroad an ir­res­ist­ible domin­ion of in­dus­trial po­ten­tial had formed. He, who saw through the un­truth of lib­er­al­ism like no other bour­geois, nev­er­the­less did not see through the power be­hind him, pre­cisely that so­cial tend­ency, the drum­beat to which even Hitler marched. His con­scious­ness re­gressed back to the stand­point of the in­ferior and short-sighted com­pet­itor, from which he star­ted, in or­der to render a con­cern prof­it­able in the shortest time pos­sible. The hour of the Ger­mans ne­ces­sar­ily fell prey to such stu­pid­ity. For only those who were as in­ex­per­i­enced in the world eco­nomy as they were nar­row-minded in world cul­tural and so­cial trends could mo­bil­ize these for war, and their stub­born­ness for the sake of sheer activ­ity devoid of any re­flec­tion. Hitler's stu­pid­ity was a ruse of reason. ]{.calibre3}

[Opin­ion of the di­let­tante]{.calibre22}[. -- The Third Reich did not suc­ceed in cre­at­ing a single work of art, a single con­cep­tual struc­ture, which could have sat­is­fied even the thread­bare lib­er­al­istic de­mand of "niveau" \[French: artistic level\]. The de­moli­tion of hu­man­ity and the con­ser­va­tion of spir­itual goods were as little com­pat­ible as air raid shel­ters and stork's nests, and the cul­ture re­newed by battle looked from the very first day like the cit­ies on the very last day: a heap of rubble. At least the pop­u­la­tion countered it with pass­ive res­ist­ance. By no means how­ever were pre­sum­ably lib­er­ated cul­tural en­er­gies soaked up in the tech­nical, polit­ical and mil­it­ary realms. The whole thing is truly bar­bar­ism and con­tin­ues to tri­umph over its own Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\]. One can ob­serve this in strategy. The Fas­cist era did not cause it to blos­som, but ab­ol­ished it. The great mil­it­ary con­cep­tions were in­sep­ar­able from cun­ning, ima­gin­a­tion: al­most from private clev­erness and ini­ti­at­ive. They be­longed to a dis­cip­line which was re­l­at­ively in­de­pend­ent from the pro­duc­tion-pro­cess. What coun­ted were spe­cial­ized in­nov­a­tions, like us­ing the di­ag­onal battle form­a­tion or the ac­cur­acy of the ar­til­lery, to de­cide the is­sue. Some­thing of bour­geois, free-stand­ing, en­tre­pren­eur­ial vir­tue was in all that. Han­ni­bal came from a line of mer­chants, not her­oes, and Na­po­leon from the demo­cratic re­volu­tion. The mo­ment of bour­geois com­pet­i­tion in the wa­ging of war has been de­railed in Fas­cism. It raised the found­a­tional idea of strategy to an ab­so­lute, the util­iz­a­tion of the tem­por­ary dis­pro­por­tion between the elite of a na­tion or­gan­ized for murder, and the total po­ten­tial of the other. Yet hav­ing in­ven­ted total war as a con­sequence of this idea, and ab­ol­ish­ing the dif­fer­ence between the army and in­dustry, they li­quid­ated strategy. It is as out­moded as the sound of mil­it­ary bands and pic­tures of battle­ships. Hitler sought world con­quest through con­cen­trated ter­ror. How­ever the means he used were already un­stra­tegic, the mass­ing of over­power­ing ma­ter­ial in spe­cific places, the crude frontal break­through, the mech­an­ical en­circlement of op­pon­ents left be­hind the gaps in the front. This prin­ciple, totally and com­pletely quant­it­at­ive, pos­it­iv­istic, with no sur­prises, and thus every­where "pub­lic" and fused with ad­vert­ising, no longer suf­ficed. The Al­lies, in­fin­itely wealth­ier in eco­nomic re­sources, needed only to trump Ger­man tac­tics to de­feat Hitler. The stupor and list­less­ness of the war, the gen­eral de­feat­ism, which ex­ten­ded the dur­a­tion of the calam­ity, were con­di­tioned by the de­cay of strategy. When all ac­tions are math­em­at­ic­ally cal­cu­lated, they sim­ul­tan­eously take on the as­pect of some­thing stu­pid. As if in mock­ery of the thought that any­one at ran­dom ought to be able to run the state, the war was con­duc­ted, with the help of radar and ar­ti­fi­cial har­bors, rather like how a school­boy stick­ing flags in a map might have ima­gined it. Spen­gler hoped that the golden age of the en­gin­eers would suc­ceed the down­fall of the West. In the per­spect­ive of the lat­ter, how­ever, the down­fall of tech­nics \[]{.calibre3}[Tech­nik]{.calibre22}[\] it­self is be­com­ing vis­ible.]{.calibre3}

[Pseudo­menos ]{.calibre22}[\[Greek: ]{.calibre3}[liar]{.calibre22}[\]. -- The mag­netic power which ideo­lo­gies ex­ert over hu­man be­ings, while they have be­come en­tirely thread­bare, is to be ex­plained bey­ond psy­cho­logy, in the ob­ject­ively de­term­ined de­cay of lo­gical evid­ence as such. It has come to the point that lies sound like truth, and truth like lies. Every state­ment, every news re­port, every thought is pre­formed by the cen­ters of the cul­ture-in­dustry. What does not bear the trus­ted mark of such pre­form­a­tion lacks cred­ib­il­ity in ad­vance, all the more so that the in­sti­tu­tions of pub­lic opin­ion gar­nish what they send out with a thou­sand fac­tual proofs and all the power of con­vic­tion which the total ap­par­atus can bring to bear. The truth which would like to do some­thing against this, bears not merely the char­ac­ter of some­thing im­prob­able, but is moreover too poor to break through in dir­ect com­pet­i­tion with the highly con­cen­trated ap­par­atus of dis­sem­in­a­tion. The Ger­man ex­treme sheds light on the en­tire mech­an­ism. When the Nazis began to tor­ture, they did not merely ter­ror­ize people both in­side and out­side the coun­try, but were at the same time the more se­cure against ex­pos­ure, the more sav­age the at­ro­cit­ies be­came. Its sheer un­be­lievab­il­ity made it easy to dis­be­lieve what, for the sake of peace, no-one wanted to be­lieve, while sim­ul­tan­eously ca­pit­u­lat­ing be­fore it. Those who trembled in fear told them­selves that things were much ex­ag­ger­ated: well into the war, the de­tails of the con­cen­tra­tion camps were un­wel­come in the Eng­lish press. Every hor­ror in the en­lightened world turns ne­ces­sar­ily into a hor­ror story \[]{.calibre3}[Greuelmärchen]{.calibre22}[\]. For the un­truth of the truth has a ker­nel, to which the un­con­scious eagerly \[]{.calibre3}[be­gierig an­s­pricht]{.calibre22}[\] turns. It does not only wish for hor­ror. Rather Fas­cism is in fact less "ideo­lo­gical," to the ex­tent it im­me­di­ately pro­claimed the prin­ciple of dom­in­a­tion, which was else­where hid­den. Whatever hu­mane prin­ciples the demo­cra­cies mar­shaled to op­pose it, were ef­fort­lessly re­but­ted by point­ing out that these do not con­cern all of hu­man­ity, but merely its false im­age, which Fas­cism is man enough to di­vest it­self of. So des­per­ate how­ever have hu­man be­ings be­come in their cul­ture, that they are ready to cast off the frail signs of a bet­ter state of af­fairs, if only the world does their worse side the fa­vor of con­fess­ing how evil it is. The polit­ical forces of op­pos­i­tion how­ever are com­pelled to make use of the lie, if they do not wish to be com­pletely ex­tin­guished as com­pletely de­struct­ive. The deeper their dif­fer­ence from the ex­ist­ent, which nev­er­the­less grants them shel­ter from a still worse fu­ture, the easier it is for the Fas­cists to nail them down as un­truths. Only the ab­so­lute lie still has the free­dom to say any­thing of the truth. The con­fu­sion of truth with lies, which makes it nearly im­possible to main­tain the dif­fer­ence between the two, and which makes hold­ing on to the simplest cog­ni­tion a labor of Sis­yphus, an­nounces the vic­tory of the prin­ciple in lo­gical or­gan­iz­a­tion, even though its mil­it­ary basis has been crushed. Lies have long legs: they are ahead of their time. The re­con­fig­ur­a­tion of all ques­tions of truth into those of power, which truth it­self can­not evade, if it does not wish to be an­ni­hil­ated by power, does not merely sup­press the truth, as in earlier des­pot­isms, but has reached into the in­ner­most core of the dis­junc­tion of true and false, whose ab­ol­i­tion the hired mer­cen­ar­ies of lo­gic are any­way fe­ver­ishly work­ing to­wards. Thus Hitler, who no-one can say if he died or es­caped, lives on. ]{.calibre3}

Fun­da­ment­ally it is the re­fusal of the bank­rupt ne­go­ti­at­ing part­ner to pay the other a penny, with the proud con­scious­ness that there's noth­ing to be got­ten from them, any­way. The legal trick of the shady law­yer har­angues it­self into heroic forti­tude: the lin­guistic for­mula of usurp­a­tion.

[De­vi­ation]{.calibre22}[. -- The of­fi­cial op­tim­ism of its ad­her­ents is a sign of the de­cay of the work­ers' move­ment. It seems to grow with the iron con­sol­id­a­tion of the cap­it­al­ist world. The in­aug­ur­at­ors never con­sidered suc­cess as guar­an­teed and for that reason said un­com­fort­able things to the work­ers' or­gan­iz­a­tions their en­tire lives. Today, now that the po­s­i­tion of the op­pon­ent and its reach over the con­scious­ness of the masses has be­come in­fin­itely stronger, the at­tempt to ab­ruptly change this con­scious­ness by re­noun­cing agree­ment with it is con­sidered re­ac­tion­ary. Those who link the cri­tique of cap­it­al­ism to that of the pro­let­ariat -- which it­self more and more merely re­flects cap­it­al­ist tend­en­cies of de­vel­op­ment -- are sus­pect. Across class bound­ar­ies, the neg­at­ive ele­ment of thought is de­nounced. The wis­dom of Kaiser Wil­liam, "I won't tol­er­ate doom­say­ers," has per­meated the ranks of those he wished to crush. Who­ever poin­ted out, for ex­ample, the com­plete lack of any spon­tan­eous res­ist­ance by Ger­man work­ers, is told it's all in flux right now, so it's not pos­sible to judge; who­ever wasn't over there, amongst the poor Ger­man vic­tims of the air raids -- vic­tims who had no qualms about air raids, as long as they were dir­ec­ted at oth­ers -- should shut up, and any­way agrarian re­forms are im­pend­ing in Ro­mania and Yugoslavia. The more how­ever that the ra­tional ex­pect­a­tion dis­ap­pears that the doom of so­ci­ety has been really aver­ted, the more rev­er­ently they pray to the old names: mass, solid­ar­ity, party, class struggle. While no thought from the cri­tique of polit­ical eco­nomy is up­held by the ad­her­ents of the Left plat­form; while its news­pa­pers daily and na­ively trum­pet theses which trump all re­vi­sion­ism, but mean ab­so­lutely noth­ing and could be re­placed on de­mand to­mor­row by ex­actly the op­pos­ite ones, the ears of those who fol­low the party line dis­play mu­sical acu­ity, as soon as there is the slight­est hint of dis­respect for slo­gans di­vested of the­ory. In­ter­na­tional pat­ri­ot­ism meshes seam­lessly with hur­rah-op­tim­ism. Those who are loyal are sup­posed pledge al­le­gi­ance to a people, re­gard­less of which one. In the dog­matic concept of a people, how­ever, the ac­know­ledg­ment of the con­text of des­tiny between hu­man be­ings as the au­thor­ity for ac­tion, the idea of a so­ci­ety eman­cip­ated from the com­pul­sion of nature is im­pli­citly re­pu­di­ated.]{.calibre3}

[Even hur­rah-op­tim­ism is the per­ver­sion of a mo­tif which has seen bet­ter days: of not be­ing able to wait. By trust­ing in the con­di­tion of tech­nics, change was thought of as im­me­di­ately im­pend­ing, as the next pos­sib­il­ity. Con­cep­tions rooted in long-range time scales, pre­cau­tions, com­pre­hens­ive pop­u­lar-ped­ago­gical meas­ures, were sus­pec­ted of sac­ri­fi­cing the goal they pro­fessed. At that time the autonom­ous will ex­pressed it­self in an op­tim­ism which de­fied death. What has re­mained of this is only the shell, the faith in the power and scope of or­gan­iz­a­tion, without the read­i­ness to play one's own part, in­deed per­meated with de­struct­ive con­vic­tion that spon­taneity may in­deed no longer be pos­sible, but the Red Army will con­quer in the end. The in­sist­ent spot-check, that every­one should af­firm that everything will turn out just fine, casts those who re­main un­yield­ing un­der sus­pi­cion of be­ing de­feat­ists and turn­coats. In fairy-tales, the toad who came from the depths was al­ways a har­binger of great hap­pi­ness. Today, when the sac­ri­fice of uto­pia looks as sim­ilar as its real­iz­a­tion as the An­ti­christ looks like the Paraclete \[the Re­deemer\], toad has be­came an epi­thet among those who them­selves re­main in the depths. Left op­tim­ism re­peats the per­ni­cious bour­geois su­per­sti­tion, one shouldn't speak of the devil but should fo­cus on the pos­it­ive. "You are not sat­is­fied with this world? Then you can go search for an­other one" -- this is the col­lo­quial speech of so­cial­ist real­ism.]{.calibre3}

[Mam­moth]{.calibre22}[. -- Some years ago, the re­port cir­cu­lated in Amer­ican news­pa­pers about the dis­cov­ery of a well-pre­served di­no­saur in the state of Utah. It was em­phas­ized that the spe­ci­men in ques­tion had out­lived its spe­cies and was a mil­lion years younger than any hitherto known. Such re­ports, like the re­puls­ively hu­mor­ous craze for the Loch Ness mon­ster and the King Kong film, are col­lect­ive pro­jec­tions of the mon­strous total state. One pre­pares for its hor­rors by get­ting used to gi­ant im­ages. In the ab­surd will­ing­ness to ac­cept these, a hu­man­ity mired in power­less­ness makes the des­per­ate at­tempt to grasp the ex­per­i­ence of what makes a mock­ery of every ex­per­i­ence. But this does not ex­haust the no­tion that pre­his­toric an­im­als are still alive or at least went ex­tinct just a few mil­lion years ago. The hope ex­cited by the pres­ence of what is most an­cient, is that an­imal cre­ation might sur­vive the in­justice done to them by hu­man be­ings, if not hu­man­ity it­self, and bring forth a bet­ter spe­cies, which fi­nally suc­ceeds. Zo­olo­gical gar­dens ori­gin­ated from the same hope. They are laid out on the model of Noah's ark, for ever since they have ex­is­ted, the bour­geois class has been wait­ing for the Bib­lical flood. The use of zoos for en­ter­tain­ment and in­struc­tion seems to be a thin pre­text. They are al­leg­or­ies of the pos­sib­il­ity that a spe­ci­men or a pair can defy the doom which be­falls the spe­cies as a spe­cies. That is why the all too richly out­fit­ted zo­olo­gical gar­dens of ma­jor European cit­ies seem like signs of de­cline: any­thing more than two ele­phants, two gir­affes, and a hip­po­pot­amus is a bad sign. Nor is there any mercy in Ha­gen­beck's lay­out with trenches and without bars, which be­tray the ark, by mas­quer­ad­ing as the sal­va­tion called Ararat. The more in­vis­ible the bound­ar­ies be­come, the more com­pletely the free­dom of the creatures is re­pu­di­ated, whose gaze could be ig­nited by the long­ing for the wide dis­tance. They re­late to proper zoos what botan­ical gar­dens are to palm leaf gar­dens. The more that civil­iz­a­tion pre­serves and trans­plants un­spoiled nature, the more im­plac­ably the lat­ter is con­trolled. One can af­ford to en­com­pass ever greater units of nature and to leave the in­terior of such tracts seem­ingly in­tact, while pre­vi­ously the se­lec­tion and do­mest­ic­a­tion of par­tic­u­lar pieces still test­i­fied to the ne­ces­sity of con­quer­ing nature. The ti­ger which paces to and fro in its cage, mir­rors back neg­at­ively through its con­fused state some­thing of hu­man­ity, but not how­ever those who frolic be­hind im­pass­able trenches. The an­ti­quated beauty of \[Al­fred\] Brehm's ]{.calibre3}[An­imal Life]{.calibre22}[ rests on this point, that it de­scribes all an­im­als as if they were be­hind the bars of a zoo, even and pre­cisely when cit­ing the re­ports of ima­gin­at­ive re­search­ers on life in the wil­der­ness. The fact how­ever that an­im­als in cages really do suf­fer more than in open lay­outs, that Ha­gen­beck in fact rep­res­ents the pro­gress of hu­man­ity, at­tests to the un­avoid­ab­il­ity of im­pris­on­ment. It is a con­sequence of his­tory. Zo­olo­gical gar­dens in their au­then­tic form are products of 19th cen­tury co­lo­nial im­per­i­al­ism. They blos­somed fol­low­ing the open­ing up of the wild re­gions of Africa and Cent­ral Asia, which paid sym­bolic trib­ute in the form of an­im­als. The value of the trib­ute was meas­ured in terms of its exoti­cism, of its rar­ity. The de­vel­op­ment of tech­nics cleared this away and ab­ol­ished exoti­cism. The lion bred on the farm is as do­mest­ic­ated as the horse, which has long since be­come sub­ject to birth-con­trol. But the mil­len­nium has not dawned. Only the ir­ra­tion­al­ity of cul­ture it­self, the nooks and cran­nies of the city, in which the walls, towers and bas­tions of zoos are crammed, are cap­able of pre­serving nature. The ra­tion­al­iz­a­tion of cul­ture, which opens a win­dow to nature, thereby com­pletely ab­sorbs it and ab­ol­ishes along with dif­fer­ence also the prin­ciple of cul­ture, the pos­sib­il­ity of re­con­cili­ation.]{.calibre3}

[Cold hostel]{.calibre22}[. -- Omin­ously, in the song cycle whose mid­point went "I\'m at the end of all my dreams," Schubert's dis­il­lu­sioned Ro­man­ti­cism des­ig­nated solely the cemetery for the name of the inn. The ]{.calibre3}[fata mor­gana]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: mirage\] of the land of idle­ness and ease is af­flic­ted by rigor mor­tis. The guests and innkeeper are un­der a spell. The former are in a hurry. They would prefer to keep their hats on. Sit­ting on un­com­fort­able seats, they are be­hooved, by checks shoved at them and the moral pres­sure of those wait­ing in line be­hind them, to leave the place, which still bears the mock­ing name of a café, as quickly as pos­sible. The innkeeper how­ever, in­clud­ing all the as­sist­ants, is not who he or she is, but a salar­ied em­ployee. Prob­ably the de­cline of the hotel craft \[]{.calibre3}[Hotel­we­sens]{.calibre22}[\] dates back to the dis­sol­u­tion of the an­tique unity of hostel and bor­dello, whose memory lives on nos­tal­gic­ally in every glance at the smartly-dressed wait­ress and the tell-tale ges­tures of the maids. Since how­ever the last am­bi­gu­ity -- even the one which still clings to the word "in­ter­course" -- has been driven out of guest ser­vice, the most hon­or­able sphere of cir­cu­la­tion, things have be­come quite grim. Step by step, and al­ways on ir­re­fut­able grounds, the means an­ni­hil­ate the ends. The di­vi­sion of labor, the sys­tem of auto­matic per­form­ances, en­sures that no-one is really in­ter­ested in the com­fort of the cus­tomer. No-one knows how to read a cus­tomer's face, for what they might be in the mood for, be­cause the waiter doesn't know the dishes any­more, and even if one sug­ges­ted some­thing one­self, one would be re­proved for over­step­ping one's com­pet­ence. No-one hur­ries to serve the pa­tiently wait­ing guest, if the one who is re­spons­ible for this is busy: the con­cern for the in­sti­tu­tion which cul­min­ates in the prison, takes pre­ced­ence -- as in the clinic -- over the sub­ject which is ad­min­istered as an ob­ject. That the "res­taur­ant" is sep­ar­ated by a hos­tile abyss from the hotel, from the empty husk of the room, is self-evid­ent, just as much as the time-lim­its on eat­ing and in the un­bear­able "room ser­vice" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], from which one flees into the drug­store, to the pub­lic shop, be­hind whose un­in­vit­ing counter a jug­gler with fried eggs, crispy ba­con and ice-cubes proves to be the last friend of the guest. In the hotel how­ever the porter brushes away every un­fore­seen ques­tion with a surly nod to an­other counter, usu­ally closed. The ob­jec­tion that all of this is noth­ing but a cat­er­waul­ing ]{.calibre3}[laud­a­tio tem­poris acti ]{.calibre22}[\[Latin: praise for times past\] doesn't hold wa­ter. Who would not prefer the Prague Blue Star or the Aus­trian Court in Salzburg, even if they had to cross the hall to enter the bath­room and if they were no longer awakened by un­fail­ing cent­ral heat­ing in the early morn­ing? The nearer one moves to the sphere of im­me­di­ate, bod­ily ex­ist­ence, the more du­bi­ous pro­gress be­comes, the Pyrrhic vic­tory of fet­ish­ized pro­duc­tion. Some­times such pro­gress be­comes afraid of it­self, and it seeks to join back to­gether the labor-func­tions which have been cal­cu­lat­ingly sep­ar­ated, if only sym­bol­ic­ally. Therein arise fig­ures such as the "host­ess" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], a syn­thetic fe­male innkeeper. Just as she in real­ity takes care of noth­ing, has no real where­withal to bring to­gether the di­vided and frozen in­sti­tu­tions, but is lim­ited to the nugat­ory ges­ture of wel­come and in any case over­see­ing the em­ploy­ees, so does she look -- peev­ishly pretty, an up­right, thin, strenu­ously youth­ful and faded wo­man. Her true pur­pose is to en­sure that the en­ter­ing guest does not even seek out the table by them­selves, at which cus­tom­ers are pro­cessed. Her amen­ity is the re­verse-pic­ture of the dig­nity of the boun­cer. ]{.calibre3}

[Gala din­ner]{.calibre22}[. -- How pro­gress and re­gres­sion are in­ter­twined today, can be gleaned from the concept of tech­nical pos­sib­il­it­ies. The mech­an­ical pro­cesses of re­pro­duc­tion have de­veloped in­de­pend­ently of what is re­pro­duced and have be­come autonom­ous. They count as pro­gress­ive, and any­thing which does not take part in them, as re­ac­tion­ary and nar­row-minded. Such be­liefs are pro­moted all the more, be­cause the mo­ment the su­per-gad­gets re­main un­used, they threaten to turn into un­prof­it­able in­vest­ments. Since their de­vel­op­ment es­sen­tially con­cerns what un­der lib­er­al­ism was called "pack­aging," and at the same time crush­ing the thing it­self un­der its own weight, which any­way re­mains ex­ternal to the ap­par­atus, the ad­apt­a­tion of needs to this pack­aging has as its con­sequence the death of the ob­ject­ive claim. The fas­cin­ated eager­ness to con­sume the new­est pro­ced­ure, does not only cre­ate in­dif­fer­ence to­wards what is trans­mit­ted, but comes to be­ne­fit sta­tion­ary junk and cal­cu­lated idiocy. It con­firms the old kitsch in ever new para­phrases as ]{.calibre3}[haute nou­veauté]{.calibre22}[ \[French: high nov­elty\].

Every­where, fol­low­ing the crowd, swarm­ing around, and stand­ing in lines sub­sti­tutes for the some­what ra­tional need. The hatred of a rad­ical, all too mod­ern com­pos­i­tion is scarcely less than that of a film which is already three months old, to which the new­est one is pre­ferred at any price, even though this last is not the slight­est bit dif­fer­ent. Just as the cus­tom­ers of mass so­ci­ety wish to be in on the scene, they can leave noth­ing out. If 19th cen­tury con­nois­seurs sat down only for one act of an op­era, with the bar­baric aside that they wouldn't cut their din­ner short for any spec­tacle, then mean­while the bar­bar­ism, which has cut off the pos­sib­il­ity of es­cape to din­ner, can­not stuff it­self enough with its own cul­ture. Every pro­gram must be sat through to the end, every "best seller" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] must be read, every film must be seen dur­ing its first re­lease in the movie theater. The abund­ance of what is con­sumed without choice be­comes calam­it­ous. It makes it im­possible to find one's way, and just as one looks for a guide \[Führer: lit­er­ally "leader" or "guide," but a pun on Hitler's of­fi­cial title\] in a mon­strous de­part­ment store, so too does the pop­u­la­tion, penned in by at­trac­tions, wait for a leader of their own.]{.calibre3}

[Auc­tion]{.calibre22}[. -- Un­fettered tech­nics elim­in­ates lux­ury, not by de­clar­ing priv­ilege as a hu­man right, but by sever­ing the pos­sib­il­ity of ful­fill­ment in the midst of rais­ing gen­eral liv­ing stand­ards. The ex­press train which races through the con­tin­ent in three nights and two days is a mir­acle, but the trip in it has noth­ing of the faded glory of the train bleu \[French: blue train\]. What com­prised the vo­lup­tu­ous­ness of travel, which began by wav­ing farewell through the open win­dow, the friendly con­cern of those who ac­cep­ted tips, the ce­re­mo­nial meals, the un­al­loyed feel­ing of be­ing favored, which does not take any­thing away from any­one else, has dis­ap­peared along with the el­eg­ant people who were wont to prom­en­ade be­fore the de­par­ture on old-fash­ioned plat­forms, and who will hence­forth be sought for in vain in the halls of the most pres­ti­gi­ous ho­tels. That the steps of the train are drawn in, sig­ni­fies to trav­el­ers on even the most ex­pens­ive ex­press that they must obey the terse in­struc­tions of the com­pany like pris­on­ers. They are given in­deed the ex­actly cal­cu­lated value for their money, but noth­ing which isn't already in­cluded in the stat­ist­ic­ally av­er­age claim. Know­ing such con­di­tions, who­ever would have the idea of set­ting out with his be­loved, as formerly was done from Paris to Nice? But one can­not shake off the sus­pi­cion that even the de­vi­ant lux­ury, which nois­ily pro­claims it­self as such, has an ele­ment of some­thing ca­pri­cious, of some­thing ar­ti­fi­cially got­ten up. As per Veblen's the­ory, it is more about per­mit­ting those who can pay, to prove to them­selves and oth­ers their status, than about meet­ing their in any case in­creas­ingly un­dif­fer­en­ti­ated needs. While the Ca­dillac is surely su­per­ior to the Chev­ro­let, since it costs more, this su­peri­or­ity, oth­er­wise than in the old Rolls Royce, is de­rived from a total plan, which clev­erly equips the first with bet­ter cyl­in­ders, brakes, and ac­cessor­ies the second with worse ones, without chan­ging any­thing in the ba­sic schema of the mass product: one need only make small changes in pro­duc­tion to trans­form a Chev­ro­let into a Ca­dillac. Thus lux­ury is be­ing hol­lowed out. For in the middle of gen­eral fun­gib­il­ity, hap­pi­ness clings without ex­cep­tion to what is not fun­gible. No ex­er­tion of hu­man­ity, no formal reas­on­ing can al­ter the fact that the cloth­ing which shim­mers like a fairy-tale is worn by the one and only, not by twenty-thou­sand oth­ers. Un­der cap­it­al­ism, the uto­pia of the qual­it­at­ive -- what by vir­tue of its dif­fer­ence and unique­ness does not enter into the rul­ing ex­change re­la­tion­ship -- flees into the fet­ish char­ac­ter. But this prom­ise of hap­pi­ness in lux­ury pre­sup­poses once more priv­ilege, eco­nomic in­equal­ity, pre­cisely a so­ci­ety based on fun­gib­il­ity. That is why the qual­it­at­ive it­self turns into a spe­cial case of quan­ti­fic­a­tion, the not-fun­gible into the fun­gible, lux­ury into com­fort and in the end into sense­less gad­gets. In such a circle the prin­ciple of lux­ury goes to pieces even without the lev­el­ing tend­ency of mass so­ci­ety, over which the re­ac­tion­ar­ies sen­ti­ment­ally fuss and fume. The in­ner com­pos­i­tion of lux­ury is not in­dif­fer­ent to what use­less things, through their total em­bed­ding in the realm of use­ful­ness, ex­per­i­ence. Its re­main­ders, even ob­jects of the greatest qual­ity, already look like junk. The del­ic­acies with which the su­per-rich fill up their homes, call out help­lessly for a mu­seum, yet this lat­ter would, as per Valery's in­sight, kill the mean­ing of statues and paint­ings; only their mother, ar­chi­tec­ture, points to their proper place. Held fast how­ever in the houses of those to which noth­ing binds them, they are a slap in the face of the mode of ex­ist­ence which private prop­erty has de­veloped into. If the an­tiquit­ies with which mil­lion­aires be­fore the WW I sur­roun­ded them­selves still mattered, be­cause they raised the idea of the bour­geois dwell­ing to a dream -- the fear­ful dream -- without ex­plod­ing it, then the chinois­ier­ies \[French: ticky-tacky lux­ur­ies\] which they mean­while have turned to, sul­lenly tol­er­ate the private owner, who is only at ease in the light and air which are locked away by lux­ury. Func­tion­al­ist lux­ury is a non­sense, on which false Rus­sian princes who work as in­terior dec­or­at­ors for Hol­ly­wood may earn their keep. The lines of ad­vanced taste con­verge in as­ceti­cism. The child read­ing ]{.calibre3}[A Thou­sand and One Nights]{.calibre22}[, in­tox­ic­ated by ru­bies and em­er­alds, asked the ques­tion, what in­deed is so won­der­ful about the pos­ses­sion of such stones, given that they are de­scribed not as a means of ex­change, but as a hoard. The en­tire dia­lectic of en­light­en­ment is at work in this ques­tion. It is as reas­on­able as un­reas­on­able: reas­on­able, in be­com­ing aware of id­ol­iz­a­tion, un­reas­on­able, in turn­ing against its own end, which is present only there, where it is not held ac­count­able to any au­thor­ity, or in­deed to any in­ten­tion: no hap­pi­ness without fet­ish­ism. By and by, how­ever, the skep­tical child's ques­tion has spread to every lux­ury, and even na­ked sen­sual pleas­ure is not im­mune to it. To the aes­thetic eye, which rep­res­ents what is not use­ful against util­ity, what is aes­thetic -- when vi­ol­ently cut off from pur­pose -- turns into what is anti-aes­thetic, be­cause it ex­presses vi­ol­ence: lux­ury turns into bru­tal­ity. In the end it be­comes swal­lowed up by drudgery or con­served as a ca­ri­ca­ture. Whatever of the beau­ti­ful flour­ishes un­der hor­ror, is a mock­ery and ugly to it­self. Nev­er­the­less its eph­em­eral shape stands for the avoid­ab­il­ity of hor­ror. Some­thing of this para­dox lies in the basis of all art; today it is ex­pressed in the fact that art still ex­ists at all. The firmly held idea of the beau­ti­ful de­mands, that hap­pi­ness be cast off and at the same time main­tained.]{.calibre3}

[Over the moun­tains]{.calibre22}[. -- Snow White ex­presses, more per­fectly than any other fairy-tale, the idea of mel­an­choly. Its pure pic­ture is the queen, who gazes into the snow through the win­dow and wishes for her daugh­ter in terms of the life­less, an­im­ated beauty of the snow-flakes, the black sor­row of the win­dow-frame, the stab of bleed­ing; and then dy­ing in child­birth. The happy end­ing takes away noth­ing from this. As the wished-for grant­ing is really death, the sal­va­tion re­mains ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\]. For the deeper per­cep­tion does not be­lieve that she, who lies like someone sleep­ing in a glass coffin, was awakened. Isn't the poison bite of apple, dis­lodged from her throat by the bump­i­ness of the jour­ney, rather than a means of murder, the re­mainder of the un­real­ized, ex­iled life, from which only now she re­cov­ers, since no de­ceiv­ing emis­sar­ies lure her any more? And how frail sounds the happy end: "Then Snow White found him good and went with him." How it is re­pealed by the wicked tri­umph over wicked­ness. Thus when we hope for sal­va­tion, a voice says to us, that hope is in vain, and yet it is above all this hope, power­less, alone, which per­mits us to draw an­other breath. All con­tem­pla­tion can do no more, than pa­tiently de­lin­eate the am­bi­gu­ity of mel­an­choly in ever new fig­ures and ap­proaches. The truth is not to be sep­ar­ated from the de­lu­sion that one day, out of the fig­ures of ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\], there would non­ethe­less be sal­va­tion.]{.calibre3}

[In­tel­lectus sac­ri­fi­cium in­tel­lectus.]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: In­tel­lec­tu­als sac­ri­fice to in­tel­lec­tu­als\]. To pre­sume that think­ing would profit from the de­cline of the emo­tions through in­creas­ing ob­jectiv­ity, or that it would re­main in­dif­fer­ent to such, is it­self an ex­pres­sion of the pro­cess of dumb­ing down. The so­cial di­vi­sion of labor re­coils on hu­man be­ings, how­ever much the former may fa­cil­it­ate the ac­com­plish­ments re­quired of the lat­ter. The fac­ulties, which de­velop through re­cip­rocal ef­fect, shrivel once when they are torn from each other. Ni­et­z­sche's aph­or­ism, "The de­gree and kind of sexu­al­ity of hu­man be­ings reaches into the fur­thest peak of their Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[es\]" strikes at more than just a psy­cho­lo­gical state of af­fairs. Be­cause even the most dis­tant ob­jec­ti­fic­a­tions of thought are nour­ished by the drives, to des­troy the lat­ter is to des­troy the former's own con­di­tion. Isn't memory in­sep­ar­able from the love, which wants to pre­serve, what nev­er­the­less passes away? Doesn't every im­pulse of the ima­gin­a­tion arise from the wish, which tran­scends the ex­ist­ent in all fi­del­ity, by dis­pla­cing its ele­ments? In­deed isn't the simplest per­cep­tion modeled on the fear of what is per­ceived, or the de­sire for such? It is true that the ob­ject­ive mean­ing of cog­ni­tions has, with the ob­jec­ti­fic­a­tion of the world, sep­ar­ated it­self ever fur­ther from the basis of the drives; it is true that cog­ni­tion fails, where its ob­jec­ti­fied achieve­ment re­mains un­der the bale­ful spell of the wishes. How­ever if the drives are not at the same time sub­lated in the thought, which es­capes such a bale­ful spell, then there can be no cog­ni­tion any­more, and the thought which kills the wish, its father, will be over­taken by the re­venge of stu­pid­ity. Memory is ta­booed as un­cal­cul­able, un­re­li­able, ir­ra­tional. The in­tel­lec­tual asthma which res­ults from this, which cul­min­ates in the break­down of the his­tor­ical di­men­sion of con­scious­ness, im­me­di­ately de­bases the syn­thetic ap­per­cep­tion which, ac­cord­ing to Kant, is not to be sep­ar­ated from the "re­pro­duc­tion in the ima­gin­a­tion," from com­mem­or­a­tion. Ima­gin­a­tion, today at­trib­uted to the realm of the un­con­scious and de­famed in cog­ni­tion as a child­ish, in­ju­di­cious rudi­ment, cre­ates alone that in­dis­pens­able re­la­tion between ob­jects, out of which all judg­ment ori­gin­ates: if it is driven out, then the judg­ment, the ac­tual act of cog­ni­tion, is ex­or­cised as well. The cas­tra­tion of per­cep­tion, how­ever, by a con­trolling au­thor­ity, which re­fuses it any de­sir­ing an­ti­cip­a­tion, thereby com­pels it into the schema of the power­less re­pe­ti­tion of what is already fa­mil­iar. That noth­ing more is ac­tu­ally al­lowed to be seen, amounts to the sac­ri­fice of the in­tel­lect. Just as, un­der the un­res­trained primacy of the pro­duc­tion pro­cess, the where­fore of reason dis­ap­pears, un­til it de­gen­er­ates into the fet­ish­ism of it­self and of ex­tern­al­ized power, so too does it re­duce it­self down to an in­stru­ment and comes to re­semble its func­tion­ar­ies, whose thought-ap­par­atus only serves the pur­pose, of hinder­ing thought. Once the fi­nal emo­tional trace is ef­faced, what solely re­mains of think­ing is ab­so­lute tau­to­logy. The ut­terly pure reason of those who have com­pletely di­vested them­self of the ca­pa­city "to ima­gine an ob­ject even without its pres­ence," con­verges with pure un­con­scious­ness, with idiocy in the most lit­eral sense, for meas­ured by the over­ween­ing real­istic ideal of a cat­egory-free ac­tu­al­ity, every cog­ni­tion is false, and true only if the ques­tion of true or false is in­ap­plic­able. That this is a ques­tion of wide-ran­ging tend­en­cies, is evid­ent at every step of the sci­entific en­ter­prise, which is on the point of sub­jug­at­ing the rest of the world, like so many de­fense­less ru­ins.]{.calibre3}

[Dia­gnosis]{.calibre22}[. -- That the world has mean­while turned into the sys­tem which the Nazis un­justly be­rated as the lax Wei­mar Re­pub­lic, is evid­ent in the pre-es­tab­lished har­mony between in­sti­tu­tions and those who they serve. A hu­man­ity is secretly emer­ging, which hun­gers for the com­pul­sion and re­stric­tion, which the non­sensical con­tinu­ation of dom­in­a­tion im­poses. These hu­man be­ings how­ever have, favored by the ob­ject­ive so­cial ar­range­ment, seized hold of the func­tions which by rights ought to gen­er­ate dis­son­ance against the pre-es­tab­lished har­mony. Among all the cash­iered slo­gans, one stands out: "pres­sure pro­duces counter-pres­sure" -- yet if the former be­comes power­ful enough, then the lat­ter dis­ap­pears, and so­ci­ety ap­pears to want to con­trib­ute con­sid­er­ably to en­tropy, by a deadly equi­lib­rium of ten­sions. The sci­entific en­ter­prise has its ex­act equi­val­ent in the kind of minds \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[es­art\], which it har­nesses: they need hardly do any vi­ol­ence to them­selves, prov­ing eager and will­ing ad­min­is­trat­ors of their own selves. Even when they prove to be quite hu­mane and reas­on­able be­ings out­side of the en­ter­prise, they freeze into pathic stu­pid­ity the mo­ment they think pro­fes­sion­ally. Far from per­ceiv­ing such pro­hib­i­tions on thought as some­thing hos­tile, the can­did­ates -- and all sci­ent­ists are can­did­ates -- feel re­lieved. Be­cause think­ing bur­dens them with a sub­ject­ive re­spons­ib­il­ity, which their ob­ject­ive po­s­i­tion in the pro­duc­tion-pro­cess pre­vents them from ful­filling, they re­nounce it, shake a bit and run over to the other side. The dis­pleas­ure of think­ing soon turns into the in­ca­pa­city to think at all: people who ef­fort­lessly in­vent the most re­fined stat­ist­ical ob­jec­tions, when it is a ques­tion of sab­ot­aging a cog­ni­tion, are not cap­able of mak­ing the simplest pre­dic­tions of con­tent ex cathedra \[Latin: from the chair, e.g. Papal de­cision\]. They lash out at the spec­u­la­tion and in it kill com­mon sense. The more in­tel­li­gent of them have an ink­ling of what ails their men­tal fac­ulties, be­cause the symp­toms are not uni­ver­sal, but ap­pear in the or­gans, whose ser­vice they sell. Many still wait in fear and shame, at be­ing caught with their de­fect. All how­ever find it raised pub­licly to a moral ser­vice and see them­selves be­ing re­cog­nized for a sci­entific as­ceti­cism, which is noth­ing of the sort, but the secret con­tour of their weak­ness. Their re­sent­ment is so­cially ra­tion­al­ized un­der the for­mula: think­ing is un­scientific. Their in­tel­lec­tual en­ergy is thereby amp­li­fied in many di­men­sions to the ut­most by the mech­an­ism of con­trol. The col­lect­ive stu­pid­ity of re­search tech­ni­cians is not simply the ab­sence or re­gres­sion of in­tel­lec­tual ca­pa­cit­ies, but an over­growth of the ca­pa­city of thought it­self, which eats away at the lat­ter with its own en­ergy. The mas­ochistic malice \[]{.calibre3}[Bosheit]{.calibre22}[\] of young in­tel­lec­tu­als de­rives from the malevol­ence \[]{.calibre3}[Bösartigkeit]{.calibre22}[\] of their ill­ness. ]{.calibre3}

[Large and small]{.calibre22}[. -- One of the most dis­astrous trans­fers from the realm of eco­nomic plan­ning into that of the­ory, which is ac­tu­ally no longer dis­tin­guished from the ar­chi­tec­tonic of the whole, is the be­lief that in­tel­lec­tual labor can be ad­min­istered ac­cord­ing to the cri­teria of whether what one is work­ing on is ne­ces­sary or reas­on­able. A rank­ing hier­archy of ur­gency is es­tab­lished. But to rob thought of the mo­ment of in­vol­un­tar­i­ness, is pre­cisely to cash­ier its ne­ces­sity. It re­duces it­self to de­tach­able, in­ter­change­able dis­pos­i­tions. Just as in the war eco­nomy, where pri­or­it­ies are de­cided in the dis­tri­bu­tion of raw ma­ter­i­als, in the pro­duc­tion of this or that type of weapon, so too is a hier­archy of im­port­ance creep­ing into the con­struc­tion of the­ory, with a pref­er­ence given for es­pe­cially up to date or es­pe­cially rel­ev­ant themes, and dis­reg­ard or in­dul­gent tol­er­a­tion for what is sec­ond­ary, which may pass merely as pad­ding of the ba­sic facts, as fin­esse. The no­tion of what is rel­ev­ant is pro­duced ac­cord­ing to an or­gan­iz­a­tional point of view, that of con­tem­por­an­eity meas­ured by the ob­ject­ively most power­ful tend­ency of the day. The schem­at­iz­a­tion into im­port­ant and sub­si­di­ary sub­scribes to the form of the value-or­der of rul­ing praxis, even when it con­tra­dicts such as con­tent. In the ori­gins of pro­gress­ive philo­sophy, in Ba­con and Descartes, the cult of the im­port­ant is already at work. In the end, how­ever, this lat­ter re­veals some­thing un­free, some­thing re­gress­ive. Im­port­ance is rep­res­en­ted by the dog on a walk, which spends minutes sniff­ing at some ran­dom spot, un­yield­ing, earn­est, re­luct­ant, and then sat­is­fies its bod­ily needs, scrapes the ground with its feet and runs along, as if noth­ing had happened. In pre­his­toric times life and death may have de­pended on this; after mil­len­nia of do­mest­ic­a­tion it has turned into a nutty ritual. Who is not re­minded of this, when watch­ing a ser­i­ous com­mit­tee de­term­in­ing the ur­gency of prob­lems, be­fore the staff of cowork­ers is given a care­fully des­ig­nated and time-tabled list of tasks. Everything of im­port­ance has some­thing of such ana­chron­istic ob­stin­acy, and as a cri­terium of thought, it is tan­tamount to the lat­ter's en­sorceled fix­a­tion, to the re­nun­ci­ation of self-con­sti­tu­tion. The great themes how­ever are noth­ing other than the prim­or­dial odors, which cause the an­imal to hold still, and where pos­sible to pro­duce them once more. This does not mean that the hier­archy of im­port­ance is to be ig­nored. Just as its phil­istin­ery mir­rors that of the sys­tem, so too is it sat­ur­ated with all the lat­ter's vi­ol­ence and strin­gency. How­ever thought should not re­peat it, but dis­solve it through its com­ple­tion. The di­vi­sion of the world into primary and sub­si­di­ary mat­ters, which has al­ways served only to neut­ral­ize the key phe­nom­ena of the most ex­treme so­cial in­justice as mere ex­cep­tions, should be fol­lowed to the point that it is con­victed of its own un­truth. It, which turns everything into ob­jects, must it­self be­come the ob­ject of thought, in­stead of steer­ing the lat­ter. The great themes will also ap­pear, though scarcely in the tra­di­tional "them­atic" sense, but rather re­frac­tedly and ec­cent­ric­ally. The bar­bar­ism of im­me­di­ate mag­nitude \[]{.calibre3}[Grösse]{.calibre22}[\] re­mains philo­sophy's leg­acy of its earlier al­li­ance with ad­min­is­trat­ors and math­em­aticians: what does not bear the stamp of the over­in­flated world-his­tor­ical bustle, is con­signed to the pro­ced­ures of the pos­it­ive sci­ences. Philo­sophy be­haves therein like bad paint­ing, which ima­gines that the dig­nity of a work and the fame which it garners, de­pend on the dig­nity of the painted ob­ject; a pic­ture of the Battle of Leipzig would be worth more than a chair in ob­lique per­spect­ive. The dif­fer­ence between the con­cep­tual me­dium and the artistic one changes noth­ing in this bad naïvété. If the pro­cess of ab­strac­tion strikes all con­cep­tual form­a­tion with the de­lu­sion of mag­nitude \[]{.calibre3}[Grösse]{.calibre22}[\], then what is also pre­served in this, through the dis­tance of the ac­tion-ob­ject, through re­flec­tion and trans­par­ency, is the an­ti­dote: the self-cri­tique of reason is its own­most eth­ics \[ei­gen­ste Moral\]. Its op­pos­ite in the most re­cent phase of a thought which dis­poses over it­self is noth­ing other than the ab­ol­i­tion of the sub­ject. The ges­ture of the­or­et­ical labor, which ar­ranges themes ac­cord­ing to their im­port­ance, neg­lects those do­ing the la­bor­ing. The de­vel­op­ment of an in­creas­ingly smal­ler num­ber of tech­nical ca­pa­cit­ies is sup­posed to suf­fice, to ad­equately equip them to deal with every as­signed task. The think­ing sub­jectiv­ity is how­ever ex­actly what does not let it­self be fit­ted into a het­ero­nom­ous set of tasks ar­ranged from above: it is ad­equate to the lat­ter only in­so­far as it does not be­long to such, and its ex­ist­ence is thereby the pre­requis­ite of every ob­ject­ively bind­ing truth. The sov­er­eign mat­ter-of-fact­ness, which sac­ri­fices the sub­ject to the in­vest­ig­a­tion of truth, re­jects at once truth and ob­jectiv­ity it­self. ]{.calibre3}

[Three steps from the body]{.calibre22}[. \[col­lo­quial ex­pres­sion mean­ing, to keep one's dis­tance\] -- Pos­it­iv­ism dis­par­ages once more the dis­tance of thought to a real­ity, which real­ity it­self no longer tol­er­ates. By not want­ing the hushed-up thought to be any­thing more than some­thing pro­vi­sional, a mere ab­bre­vi­ation of what is fac­tu­ally grasped un­der it, its in­de­pend­ence ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ real­ity dis­ap­pears, as well as the en­ergy to pen­et­rate the lat­ter. The thought which ac­tu­ally breaks into em­pir­ical life, can only hap­pen at a dis­tance from life. While thought relates to facts and moves by cri­tiquing them, it moves no less through firmly held dif­fer­ence. It thereby ex­presses ex­actly what is, be­cause it is never en­tirely just what it ex­presses. Es­sen­tial to it is an ele­ment of ex­ag­ger­a­tion, of shoot­ing bey­ond things, of dis­so­ci­ation from the weight of what is fac­tual, by vir­tue of which it com­pletes the de­term­in­a­tion of be­ing, at once strictly and freely, in­stead of merely re­pro­du­cing it. Every thought re­sembles therein play, with which Hegel no less than Ni­et­z­sche com­pared with the work of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[\]. What is un­bar­baric in philo­sophy rests on the ta­cit con­scious­ness of that ele­ment of ir­re­spons­ib­il­ity, of blessed­ness, which stems from the fleet­ing­ness of thought, which con­tinu­ally es­capes, what it judges. Such ex­cess­ive­ness is sus­pect to the pos­it­iv­istic Spirit and handed over to folly. The dif­fer­ence from facts turns into mere in­cor­rect­ness, the mo­ment of play into a lux­ury, in a world where the in­tel­lec­tual func­tions must ac­count for every minute of their time with a stop­watch. How­ever as soon as thought denies its un­sur­mount­able dis­tance and wishes to prove its lit­eral cor­rect­ness with a thou­sand subtle ar­gu­ments, it trips it­self up. If it falls out of the me­dium of the vir­tual, of an­ti­cip­a­tion, which can­not be ful­filled by any single ac­tu­al­ity, in short, if it seeks to be­come a simple state­ment rather than a mean­ing, then everything which it states be­comes in fact false. Its apo­lo­get­ics, in­spired by in­sec­ur­ity and a bad con­science, can be re­but­ted at every step by re­course to that non-iden­tity, which it does not wish to ac­know­ledge, and which nev­er­the­less alone makes it thought. If it wanted to make ex­cuses for dis­tance as if it was a priv­ilege, it would do no bet­ter, but would pro­claim two sorts of truths, that of facts and that of con­cepts. That would dis­pel the truth and de­nounce think­ing. Dis­tance is no se­cur­ity-zone but a field of ten­sion. It mani­fests it­self not so much in slack­en­ing the truth-claim of con­cepts, as in the ten­der­ness and fra­gil­ity of think­ing. What is called for in re­gards to pos­it­iv­ism is neither can­tan­ker­ous­ness nor put­ting on airs, but rather the cog­nit­ive-crit­ical proof of the im­possib­il­ity of a co­in­cid­ence between the concept and what ful­fills it. The hunt for the ac­count-bal­an­cing \[]{.calibre3}[In­ein­ander-Aufge­hen]{.calibre22}[\] of what can­not be re­duced to the same de­nom­in­ator is not the per­en­ni­ally striv­ing toil, which beck­ons to sal­va­tion, but na­ive and in­ex­per­i­enced. What pos­it­iv­ism re­proaches think­ing for, thought has known and for­got­ten a thou­sand times over, and only in such know­ing and for­get­ting does it be­come think­ing. That dis­tance of thought from real­ity is it­self noth­ing other than the pre­cip­it­ate of his­tory in con­cepts. Op­er­at­ing with the lat­ter without dis­tance would be, amidst all its resig­na­tion, or per­haps pre­cisely be­cause of such, the af­fair of chil­dren. For thought must aim bey­ond its ob­ject, pre­cisely be­cause it does not en­tirely ar­rive at such, and by as­sum­ing that it does ar­rive, pos­it­iv­ism is un­crit­ical, ima­gin­ing that it tar­ries there out of mere con­scien­tious­ness. The tran­scend­ing thought takes its own in­ad­equacy into ac­count more thor­oughly than one steered by the sci­entific con­trol-ap­par­atus. It ex­tra­pol­ates, how­ever hope­lessly, in or­der to mas­ter what is un­avoid­ably too little, by vir­tue of the over­taxed ex­er­tion of what is too much. The il­le­git­im­ate ab­so­lut­ism which philo­sophy is re­proached for, the al­legedly con­clus­ive stamp, ori­gin­ates pre­cisely in the abyss of re­lativ­ity. The ex­ag­ger­a­tions of spec­u­lat­ive meta­phys­ics are scars of re­flect­ing un­der­stand­ing, and solely what is not yet proven un­veils proof as tau­to­logy. By con­trast the im­me­di­ate caveat of re­lativ­ity, what con­fines it­self, what re­mains in the same de­lim­ited con­cep­tual realm, de­prives it­self through such cau­tion of pre­cisely the limit, which to think is, in Hegel's mag­ni­fi­cent in­sight, the same as to cross. The re­lat­iv­ists would ac­cord­ingly be the true -- the bad -- ab­so­lut­ists and moreover the bour­geoisie, who would like to in­sure their know­ledge \[]{.calibre3}[Erken­ntis]{.calibre22}[: cog­ni­tion\] like prop­erty, only to lose it all the more thor­oughly. Solely the claim of the un­con­di­tional, the spring over the shadow, does justice to what is re­l­at­ive. By tak­ing un­truth on it­self, it leads to the bor­der of truth in the con­crete con­scious­ness of the con­di­tion­al­ity of hu­man know­ledge \[]{.calibre3}[Erken­ntis]{.calibre22}[: cog­ni­tion\].]{.calibre3}

[Vice-Pres­id­ent]{.calibre22}[. -- Ad­vice to in­tel­lec­tu­als: don't let yourselves be rep­res­en­ted. The fun­gib­il­ity of all ac­com­plish­ments and hu­man be­ings and the be­lief de­rived from this, that every­one should be able to do everything, prove in the midst of the ex­ist­ent to be a fet­ter. The egal­it­arian ideal of in­ter­change­ab­il­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Ver­tret­barkeit]{.calibre22}[: fun­gib­il­ity\] is a fraud, if it is not sup­por­ted by the prin­ciple of re­voc­ab­il­ity and ac­count­ab­il­ity to the "rank and file" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]. The ones who are most power­ful are those who do the least them­selves, while shift­ing as much of the bur­den as they can onto oth­ers, to who they lend their name while pock­et­ing the ad­vant­age. It seems like col­lect­iv­ism and amounts only to mak­ing one­self seem too good, of be­ing ex­empt from labor by vir­tue of ac­cess to its ali­en­ated form. To be sure, in­ter­change­ab­il­ity has an ob­ject­ive basis in ma­ter­ial pro­duc­tion. The quan­ti­fic­a­tion of labor pro­cesses di­min­ishes over time the dif­fer­ence between the gen­eral dir­ector and the ser­vice-em­ployee in the gas­ol­ine sta­tion. It is a miser­able ideo­logy, to claim that un­der present con­di­tions the ad­min­is­tra­tion of a trust re­quires any more in­tel­li­gence, ex­per­i­ence, and even train­ing than read­ing a mano­meter. While this ideo­logy is ten­a­ciously up­held in ma­ter­ial pro­duc­tion, the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] is sub­jug­ated to its op­pos­ite. This is the doc­trine, since gone to the dogs, of the ]{.calibre3}[uni­versitas lit­erarum]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: world of know­ledge\], of the equal­ity of all in the re­pub­lic of sci­ences, wherein every per­son does not merely check up on every­one else, but is sup­posed to be qual­i­fied to do what any­one else does, equally well. In­ter­change­ab­il­ity sub­jug­ates thought to the same pro­ced­ure just as ex­change does to things. What is in­com­men­sur­able is elim­in­ated. Since how­ever thought must first of all cri­tique the com­pre­hens­ive com­men­sur­ab­il­ity which stems from the ex­change-re­la­tion­ship, this com­men­sur­ab­il­ity, as the in­tel­lec­tual \[]{.calibre3}[geistiges]{.calibre22}[\] re­la­tions of pro­duc­tion, turns against the pro­duct­ive forces. In the ma­ter­ial realm in­ter­change­ab­il­ity is what is already pos­sible, and non-in­ter­change­ab­il­ity is the pre­text, which hinders it; in the­ory, which ought to see through such a quid pro quo \[Latin: some­thing for some­thing else\], in­ter­change­ab­il­ity al­lows the ap­par­atus to pro­ceed even where its ob­ject­ive op­pos­ite might be loc­ated. Non-in­ter­change­ab­il­ity alone could halt the in­teg­ra­tion of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Gei]{.calibre22}[stes\] into the ranks of em­ploy­ees. The gra­tu­it­ously self-evid­ent de­mand, that every in­tel­lec­tual achieve­ment should be mastered by every qual­i­fied mem­ber of the or­gan­iz­a­tion, turns the most nar­row-minded sci­entific tech­ni­cian into the stand­ard of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[\]: what pre­cisely gives the lat­ter the ca­pa­city to cri­tique their own tech­ni­fic­a­tion? Thus does the eco­nomy cause that pro­cess of equal­iz­a­tion, which it else­where protests with the ges­ture "stop thief." The ques­tion of in­di­vidu­al­ity must be posed anew in the epoch of its li­quid­a­tion. While the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\], like all in­di­vidu­al­istic pro­duc­tion pro­cesses, re­mains be­hind the state of tech­nics and is his­tor­ic­ally out­moded, what de­volves to it, as the con­demned against the vic­tor, is in turn the truth. For it alone pre­serves, in how­ever a dis­tor­ted man­ner, the trace of what gives all tech­ni­fic­a­tion its au­thor­iz­a­tion, the con­scious­ness of which this tech­ni­fic­a­tion nev­er­the­less at once cuts it­self off from. By prov­ing that un­res­trained pro­gress is not im­me­di­ate identical with that of hu­man­ity, its op­pos­ite is cap­able of grant­ing pro­gress asylum. A pen­cil and eraser are of more use to thought than a staff of as­sist­ants. Those who wish neither to hand them­selves over whole­sale to the in­di­vidu­al­ism of in­tel­lec­tual pro­duc­tion, nor to com­mit them­selves head­long to the col­lect­iv­ism of an egal­it­arian in­ter­change­ab­il­ity which is con­temp­tu­ous of hu­man be­ings, must rely on free and solid­ar­istic co­oper­at­ive labor un­der com­mon re­spons­ib­il­ity. Any­thing else would sell out the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] to forms of busi­ness and thereby ul­ti­mately to the lat­ter's in­terests.]{.calibre3}

[Timetable.]{.calibre22}[ -- Few things dif­fer­en­ti­ate the mode of life ap­pro­pri­ate to in­tel­lec­tu­als so deeply from that of the bour­geoisie than the fact that the former do not re­cog­nize the al­tern­at­ive between labor and pleas­ure. The labor which need not, in or­der to cope with real­ity, ini­tially do all the evil to its sub­ject, which it later does to oth­ers, is pleas­ure even in the des­per­ate ex­er­tion. The free­dom, which it means, is the same which bour­geois so­ci­ety re­serves solely for re­cu­per­a­tion and through such re­gi­ment­a­tion at once takes back. Con­versely, those who know of free­dom find everything about what this so­ci­ety tol­er­ates as pleas­ure un­bear­able, and out­side of their work, which to be sure in­cludes what the bour­geoisie dis­place to the hol­i­days as "cul­ture," re­fuse to en­gage in sub­sti­tute pleas­ures. "Work while you work, play while you play" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] -- this counts as one of the found­ing prin­ciples of re­press­ive self-dis­cip­line. The par­ents who wanted their chil­dren to bring home good grades as a mat­ter of prestige, could least bear it when the lat­ter read too long at night or, in the par­ents' judg­ment, in­tel­lec­tu­ally over­ex­er­ted them­selves. Yet out of their fool­ish­ness spoke the genius of their class. The doc­trine drilled in since Ar­is­toteles, of mod­er­a­tion as the vir­tue be­fit­ting reason, is among other things an at­tempt, to es­tab­lish the so­cially ne­ces­sary di­vi­sion of hu­man be­ings into func­tions in­de­pend­ent of each other so firmly that none of these func­tions would get the idea of cross­ing over to oth­ers and call­ing to mind ac­tual hu­man be­ings. One could no more ima­gine Ni­et­z­sche in an of­fice, the sec­ret­ary an­swer­ing the tele­phone in the foyer, sit­ting at a desk un­til five, than play­ing golf after a full days work. Un­der the pres­sure of so­ci­ety, only the cun­ning in­ter­twin­ing of hap­pi­ness and labor would leave the door open for ac­tual ex­per­i­ence. It is con­stantly less tol­er­ated. Even the so-called in­tel­lec­tual oc­cu­pa­tions are be­ing ut­terly di­vested of pleas­ure, by their in­creas­ing re­semb­lance to busi­ness. At­om­iz­a­tion ad­vances not only between hu­man be­ings, but also in the single in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[: in­di­vidu­ated\], in its life-spheres. No ful­fill­ment may be at­tached to labor, which would oth­er­wise lose its func­tional ob­scur­ity in the to­tal­ity of pur­pose, no spark of sens­ib­il­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Bes­in­nung]{.calibre22}[\] may fall in free time, be­cause it might spring into the work-world and set it aflame. While labor and pleas­ure are be­com­ing more and more sim­ilar in their struc­ture, they are at the same time sep­ar­ated ever more strictly by in­vis­ible lines of de­marc­a­tion. Pleas­ure and Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] are be­ing driven out of both in equal meas­ure. In one as the other, brute ser­i­ous­ness and pseudo-activ­ity pre­vails.]{.calibre3}

[Muster. -- ]{.calibre22}[Who­ever is en­gaged in praxis, as it is called, is pur­su­ing in­terests, is real­iz­ing plans, auto­mat­ic­ally turns the hu­man be­ings they come into con­tact with into friends and en­emies. By look­ing at them as if de­cid­ing how they fit into their in­ten­tions, one re­duces them in ad­vance, as it were, to ob­jects: those ones are use­ful, the oth­ers are not. Every di­ver­gent opin­ion ap­pears to the ref­er­ence-sys­tem of pre­de­ter­mined pur­poses, without which no praxis could man­age, as bur­den­some res­ist­ance, sab­ot­age, in­trigue; every agree­ment, even if it came from the most despic­able in­terest, turns into sup­port, some­thing of use, a testi­mony of al­li­ance. Thus im­pov­er­ish­ment ap­pears in re­la­tion to other hu­man be­ings: the ca­pa­city to per­ceive the other as such and not as a func­tion of one's own will, above all how­ever that of fruit­ful op­pos­i­tion, the pos­sib­il­ity of go­ing bey­ond one­self through the im­bric­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Ein­be­gre­ifen]{.calibre22}[\] of what con­tra­dicts, with­ers away. It is re­placed by a judg­mental know­ledge of hu­man be­ings, for which even the best are ul­ti­mately the lesser evil, and the worst, are not the greatest. This man­ner of re­ac­tion how­ever, the schema of all ad­min­is­tra­tion and "per­son­nel policy," already tends, be­fore any polit­ical form­a­tion of will and com­mit­ment of ex­clus­ive polit­ical tick­ets, to­wards fas­cism. Who­ever has once made it their busi­ness to judge ac­cept­ab­il­ity, views the per­son be­ing judged, to a cer­tain ex­tent out of tech­no­lo­gical ne­ces­sity, as an in­sider or out­sider, one of one's own people or a for­eigner, ac­com­plice or vic­tim. The stiffly scru­tin­iz­ing, en­sorceled and en­sor­cel­ing gaze, which is typ­ical of all lead­ers of hor­ror, has its model in the ap­prais­ing one of the man­ager, who tells the ap­plic­ant to take a seat and il­lu­min­at­ing the lat­ter's face, so that it piti­lessly dis­in­teg­rates into the light of use­ful­ness and the dark of what is ob­jec­tion­able or un­qual­i­fied. The end is the med­ical in­vest­ig­a­tion, ac­cord­ing to the al­tern­at­ives: as­sign­ment in the labor-force or li­quid­a­tion. The New Test­a­ment sen­tence, "Who­ever is not for me, is against me" was from time im­me­morial spoken from the heart of anti-Semit­ism. It is a fun­da­mental fea­ture of dom­in­a­tion, that every­one who does not identify with such, is re­leg­ated for the sake of mere dif­fer­ence to the en­emy camp: it is not for noth­ing that Cath­oli­cism is merely the Greek word for the Latin to­tal­ity, which the Nazis have real­ized. It means the equal­iz­a­tion of what is dif­fer­ent, whether "de­vi­ation" or an­other race, with the en­emy. Nazism has therein achieved the his­tor­ical con­scious­ness of it­self: Carl Schmitt defined the es­sence of the polit­ical pre­cisely by the cat­egor­ies of en­emy and friend. Pro­gress to such con­scious­ness makes the re­gres­sion to the child's mode of be­ha­vior -- chil­dren either like things, or are afraid -- to its own. The a pri­ori re­duc­tion to the friend-en­emy re­la­tion­ship is one of the Ur-phe­nom­ena of re­cent an­thro­po­logy. Free­dom would not be choos­ing between black and white, but step­ping out of such a pro­script­ive choice.]{.calibre3}

[Little Hans]{.calibre22}[. -- In­tel­lec­tu­als, and es­pe­cially those in­clined to philo­sophy, are cut off from ma­ter­ial praxis: dis­gust for it drove them to deal with so-called in­tel­lec­tual things. But ma­ter­ial praxis is not only the pre­requis­ite of their own ex­ist­ence, but also rests on the basis of the world, with whose cri­tique their labor co­in­cides. If they know noth­ing of the basis, then they end up in the void. They stand be­fore the choice, of be­ing in­formed or of turn­ing their backs on what they de­test. If they in­form them­selves, then they do vi­ol­ence to them­selves, think­ing against their im­pulses and, on top of everything else, are in danger of be­com­ing as sor­did as what they are deal­ing with, for the eco­nomy is no joke, and who­ever wishes even to un­der­stand it, must "think eco­nom­ic­ally." If they how­ever do not in­volve them­selves, they hy­po­stat­ize their Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], which was above all formed on eco­nomic real­ity, on the ab­stract ex­change-re­la­tion, as some­thing ab­so­lute, while this lat­ter could be­come Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] solely in the sens­ib­il­ity of its own con­di­tion­al­ity. The in­tel­lec­tual is thereby se­duced into vainly and dis­con­nec­tedly sub­sti­tut­ing the re­flex for the thing. The fatu­ous-de­cept­ive im­port­ance, which the pub­lic cul­tural en­ter­prise as­signs to in­tel­lec­tual products, adds stones to the wall, which locks cog­ni­tion away from eco­nomic bru­tal­ity. The isol­a­tion of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] from busi­ness helps the in­tel­lec­tual busi­ness to be­come a com­fort­able ideo­logy. The di­lemma reaches deep into the most subtle re­ac­tions of the in­tel­lec­tual mode of con­duct. Only those who re­main pure to a cer­tain ex­tent, have enough hate, nerves, free­dom and mo­bil­ity to with­stand the world, but pre­cisely by vir­tue of the il­lu­sion of pur­ity -- for they live in the "third per­son" -- they al­low it to tri­umph not merely the world out­side, but in the in­ner­most cells of their thought. Who­ever how­ever knows the busi­ness all too well, thereby un­learns \[]{.calibre3}[verlernen]{.calibre22}[: to for­get, un­learn\] to re­cog­nize it; the ca­pa­city of dis­tinc­tion van­ishes from them, and they are threatened by the re­lapse into bar­bar­ism, just as oth­ers are threatened by the fet­ish­ism of cul­ture. That in­tel­lec­tu­als are at the same time be­ne­fi­ciar­ies of the bad so­ci­ety and yet those, on whose so­cially un­ne­ces­sary labor it largely de­pends, as to whether a so­ci­ety eman­cip­ated from util­ity suc­ceeds -- this is by no means a con­tra­dic­tion which is once and for all ac­cept­able and thus ir­rel­ev­ant. It gnaws un­ceas­ingly at its ob­ject­ive qual­ity. Whatever in­tel­lec­tu­als do, is wrong. They ex­per­i­ence drastic­ally, as a life and death is­sue, the ig­no­mini­ous al­tern­at­ive, which late cap­it­al­ism secretly poses to all of its mem­bers: to be­come just an­other adult or to re­main a child.]{.calibre3}

[Fight club]{.calibre22}[. \[]{.calibre3}[Ringver­ein]{.calibre22}[: wrest­ling-club\] -- There is a type of in­tel­lec­tual, who is all the more thor­oughly to be dis­trus­ted, the more they curry fa­vor through hon­esty of toil, "in­tel­lec­tual ser­i­ous­ness," and even mod­est sobri­ety. These are the fight­ers, who are in a per­man­ent struggle with them­selves, who cast their de­cisions in terms of the mil­it­ary mo­bil­iz­a­tion of the en­tire per­son. But things aren't so ter­rible as that. Their rad­ical stance, of put­ting everything on the line, has nev­er­the­less a re­li­able arma­ture at its dis­posal, whose dex­ter­ous de­ploy­ment in the battle with the an­gel pun­ishes the former as a lie: one need only page through the books of pub­lish­ers like Eu­gene Diederich or in those of a cer­tain kind of cringingly eman­cip­ated theo­lo­gians. The bar­rel-ches­ted vocab­u­lary casts doubt on the "fair­ness" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] of the fight match ar­ranged and fought out by in­ward­ness. The ex­pres­sions all refer to war, life-threat­en­ing danger, ac­tual an­ni­hil­a­tion, but they de­scribe mere pro­ced­ures of re­flec­tion, which in­deed may have been linked to a fatal out­come for Kierkegaard and Ni­et­z­sche, who the fight­ers like to quote, but cer­tainly not how­ever their un­elec­ted fol­low­ers, who claim to be at risk. While they credit the sub­lim­a­tion of the struggle for ex­ist­ence -- that of spir­itu­al­iz­a­tion and that of cour­age -- to their re­doubled honor, the mo­ment of danger is sim­ul­tan­eously neut­ral­ized by in­tern­al­iz­a­tion, de­bas­ing it to an in­gredi­ent of a smugly rooted, hale and hearty world-view. The ex­ternal world is re­garded from an in­dif­fer­ent-su­per­ior vant­age point, be­cause due to the ser­i­ous­ness of the de­cision, it doesn't even enter into the equa­tion; it is left as it is, and in the end even ac­know­ledged. The sav­age ex­pres­sions are artsy-craftsy dec­or­a­tion like the cowry-shells of the fe­male gym­nasts, whose com­pany the fight­ers are so par­tial to. The sword-dance is de­cided in ad­vance. It doesn't mat­ter if the cat­egor­ical im­per­at­ive has the vic­tory or the right of the in­di­vidual -- if the can­did­ate suc­ceeds in free­ing them­selves from per­sonal be­lief in God or re­cov­ers it again, if they with­stand the abyss of be­ing or the har­row­ing ex­per­i­ence of the senses, they fall on their feet. For the power which dir­ects the con­flicts, the ethos of re­spons­ib­il­ity and in­teg­rity, is al­ways cast in an au­thor­it­arian mold, a mask of the state. As long as they choose the ap­pro­pri­ate goods, then everything is just fine. If they come to re­bel­li­ous con­clu­sions, then they cater to and trump the de­mand for power­ful, in­de­pend­ent men. In every case they cer­tify like good sons the of­fice, which could hold them to ac­count, and in whose name nev­er­the­less the en­tire in­tern­al­ized trial was ac­tu­ally con­duc­ted: the gaze, un­der which they seem to be brawl­ing like two ill-mannered school-boys, is from the start the one which pun­ishes. No fight match without ref­er­ees: the en­tire brawl is staged by a so­ci­ety, which has mi­grated into the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\], sim­ul­tan­eously su­per­vising the battle and par­ti­cip­at­ing in it. It tri­umphs all the more fatally, the more op­pos­i­tional the res­ults are: priests and senior school-mas­ters, whose con­science com­pels them to con­fess to world-views which get them in trouble with the au­thor­it­ies, al­ways sym­path­ize with per­se­cu­tion and counter-re­volu­tion. Just as self-con­firm­ing con­flicts have an il­lus­ory ele­ment in them, so too is the bogusly staged dy­namic of self-tor­ment really re­pres­sion on the fly. They de­veloped the en­tire spir­itual en­ter­prise only be­cause they are not per­mit­ted to dis­charge their il­lu­sion and rage out­side, and are pre­pared to trans­form the battle with the in­ner en­emy once more into the deed, which ac­cord­ing to them was there in the be­gin­ning. Their pro­to­type is Luther, the in­ventor of in­ward­ness, who threw his bottle of ink at the body of the devil, who does not ex­ist, already mean­ing the peas­ants and Jews. Only the crippled Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] needs self-hatred in or­der to demon­strate its spir­itual es­sence, which is un­truth, with phys­ical vi­ol­ence.]{.calibre3}

[Simple Si­mon]{.calibre22}[. -- That the in­di­vidual is be­ing li­quid­ated lock, stock and bar­rel, is still too op­tim­istic a thought. The sal­va­tion of the in­di­vidual be­ing \[]{.calibre3}[Ein­zel­wesen]{.calibre22}[\] would lie in the ab­ol­i­tion of the monad through solid­ar­ity, in its bind­ing neg­a­tion, for only in its re­la­tion to the gen­er­al­ity would the former be­come some­thing spe­cific. The con­tem­por­ary con­di­tion is far dis­tant from this. The calam­ity oc­curs not as the rad­ical ex­tirp­a­tion of what has been, but rather by ig­no­mini­ously pulling down what is his­tor­ic­ally con­demned and drag­ging it along power­lessly as dead, neut­ral­ized. In the middle of stand­ard­ized and ad­min­istered hu­man units the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] con­tin­ues to ex­ist. It is even pro­tec­ted and wins mono­poly-value. But it is in truth still merely the func­tion of its own unique­ness, an ex­hib­i­tion piece like the fetuses in jars, at which chil­dren once stared and grinned. Since it no longer leads an in­de­pend­ent eco­nomic ex­ist­ence, its char­ac­ter ends up in con­tra­dic­tion with its ob­ject­ive so­cial role. Pre­cisely be­cause of this con­tra­dic­tion, it is sheltered in nature-parks, en­joyed in idle con­tem­pla­tion. The in­di­vidu­al­it­ies im­por­ted into Amer­ica, which through im­port­a­tion are already no longer such, are called "col­or­ful per­son­al­ity" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]. Their eager un­in­hib­ited moods, their wacky ideas, their "ori­gin­al­ity," even if this was only a spe­cial ugli­ness, even their mangled ac­cent de­val­ues what is hu­man as the cos­tume of a clown. Since they are rendered as sub­al­terns in the uni­ver­sal mech­an­ism of com­pet­i­tion, and can only ad­apt them­selves to the mar­ket and sur­vive via their para­lyzed oth­er­ness, they fall pas­sion­ately into the priv­ilege of their self and ex­ag­ger­ate them­selves, to the point of com­pletely up­root­ing what they stood for. They clev­erly flaunt on their ]{.calibre3}[naïvété]{.calibre22}[, which, as they quickly dis­cover, en­dear them to the powers that be. They sell them­selves as heart-warm­ers in the com­mer­cial cold, flat­ter through ag­gress­ive jokes, which are mas­ochist­ic­ally en­joyed by their pro­tect­ors, and con­firm through their comic lack of dig­nity, the sol­emn dig­nity of the host-na­tion. The ]{.calibre3}[grae­culi]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: Greek ex­pat­ri­ate teach­ers of Latin\] may have be­haved sim­il­arly in the Ro­man Em­pire. Those who put their in­di­vidu­al­ity on sale, pass the sen­tence of judg­ment which so­ci­ety has pro­nounced on them -- as their own vol­un­tary judges -- as their own. Thus they also ob­ject­ively jus­tify the in­justice, which they ex­per­i­ence. They un­der­bid the gen­eral re­gres­sion as private con­tract­ors of the re­gress­ive, and even their loud res­ist­ance is mostly only a more de­vi­ous means of ad­apt­a­tion to weak­ness.]{.calibre3}

[Black­mail]{.calibre22}[. -- Who­ever won't take any ad­vice, can't be helped, said the bour­geoisie, with ad­vice which cost noth­ing, wish­ing to buy them­selves out of help­ing while at the same time win­ning power over the needy per­son who came to them. But con­tained therein was at least the ap­peal to reason, which was thought of in the same way by the sup­plic­ant and the one who de­clined to help, and which at a dis­tance re­called justice: who­ever fol­lowed clever ad­vice, might oc­ca­sion­ally find a way out. That's all over. Those who can­not help, should there­fore not give ad­vice: in a so­cial or­der, in which all mouse-holes are stopped up, mere ad­vice turns im­me­di­ately into con­dem­na­tion. It is in­ev­it­ably tan­tamount to telling the sup­plic­ant to do ex­actly whatever is left of their ego most vi­ol­ently re­jects. Wiser for a thou­sand pre­vi­ous situ­ations, they know all too well what sort of ad­vice they will re­ceive, and come only when in­genu­ity has failed and some­thing must hap­pen. They are not im­proved by this. Who­ever once sought ad­vice and finds no help any­more, above all those who are weaker, ap­pear in ad­vance to be ex­tor­tion­ists, whose mode of con­duct is spread­ing ir­res­ist­ibly along with the great trusts. One can ob­serve this most clearly in a cer­tain type of per­son who is com­mit­ted to help, who looks out for the in­terests of needy and power­less friends, and yet who takes on the as­pect of some­thing darkly omin­ous in their zeal. Even their finest vir­tue, self­less­ness, is am­bigu­ous. While they are right to in­ter­vene for those who should not fall into ruin, be­hind the in­sist­ent "you must help" stands the ta­cit ap­peal to the he­ge­mony of col­lect­ives and groups, which no-one can af­ford any longer to slight.

[In­sti­tute for deaf-mutes.]{.calibre22}[ -- While the schools drill hu­man be­ings in speech as in first aid for the vic­tims of traffic ac­ci­dents and in the con­struc­tion of gliders, the schooled ones be­come ever more si­lent. They can give speeches, every sen­tence qual­i­fies them for the mi­cro­phone, be­fore which they can be placed as rep­res­ent­at­ives of the av­er­age, but the ca­pa­city to speak with each other is be­ing suf­foc­ated. It pre­sup­poses an ex­per­i­ence worthy of be­ing com­mu­nic­ated, free­dom of ex­pres­sion, and in­de­pend­ence as much as so­cial re­la­tions. In the all-en­com­passing sys­tem con­ver­sa­tion turns into vent­ri­lo­quism. Every­one is their own Charlie Mc­Carthy: thus the lat­ter's pop­ular­ity. Words are turn­ing al­to­gether into the for­mu­las, which were pre­vi­ously re­served for greet­ings and farewells. For ex­ample, a young lady suc­cess­fully raised ac­cord­ing to the latest de­sid­erata should be able to say, at every mo­ment, what is ap­pro­pri­ate in a "situ­ation," ac­cord­ing to tried and true guidelines. How­ever such de­term­in­ism of speech through ad­apt­a­tion is its end: the re­la­tion between the thing and the ex­pres­sion is severed, and just as the con­cepts of the pos­it­iv­ists are sup­posed to be noth­ing more than place­hold­ers, those of pos­it­iv­istic hu­man­ity are lit­er­ally turned into coins. What is hap­pen­ing in the voices of the speak­ers, is what, ac­cord­ing to the in­sight of psy­cho­logy, happened to that of the con­science, from whose res­on­ance all speech lives: it is re­placed down to the most re­fined ca­dence by a so­cially pre­pared mech­an­ism. As soon as this last stops func­tion­ing, cre­at­ing pauses, un­fore­seen by un­writ­ten stat­utes of law, panic en­sures. This has led to the rise of in­tric­ate games and other free-time activ­it­ies, which are sup­posed to dis­pense with the bur­den of con­science of speech. The shadow of fear how­ever falls omin­ously on the speech which re­mains. Im­par­ti­al­ity and ob­jectiv­ity in the dis­cus­sion of ob­jects are dis­ap­pear­ing even in the most in­tim­ate circles, just as in polit­ics, where the dis­cus­sion was long since dis­pelled by the word of power. Speak­ing is tak­ing on a ma­lign ges­ture. It is be­com­ing spor­ti­fied. One tries to score as many points as pos­sible: there is no con­ver­sa­tion which the op­por­tun­ity for com­pet­i­tion does not worm it­self into, like a poison. The emo­tions gen­er­ated by the sub­jects be­ing dis­cussed, in con­ver­sa­tions worthy of hu­man be­ings, at­tach them­selves pig­headedly to the nar­row is­sue of who is right, out­side of any re­la­tion­ship to the rel­ev­ance of the state­ment. As a pure means of power, how­ever, the dis­en­chanted word ex­erts a ma­gical power over those who use it. It can be ob­served time and time again how some­thing once uttered, no mat­ter how ab­surd, ac­ci­dental or in­cor­rect, pre­cisely be­cause it was once said, tyr­an­nizes the speaker like a pos­ses­sion they can­not break away from. Words, num­bers, and meet­ings, once con­cocted and ex­pressed, be­come in­de­pend­ent and bring all man­ner of calam­ity to those in their vi­cin­ity. They form a zone of para­noid in­fec­tion, and it re­quires the max­imum reason to break their bale­ful spell. The ma­gic­al­iz­a­tion of the great and in­con­sequen­tial polit­ical slo­gans is re­peated privately, in the seem­ingly most neut­ral of ob­jects: the rigor mor­tis of so­ci­ety is over­tak­ing even the cells of in­tim­acy, which thought them­selves pro­tec­ted from it. Noth­ing is be­ing done to hu­man­ity from the out­side only: dumb­ness is the ob­ject­ive Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\].]{.calibre3}

[Van­dals]{.calibre22}[. -- The haste, nervous­ness and dis­con­tinu­ity ob­serv­able since the rise of the great cit­ies, is spread­ing epi­dem­ic­ally, as plague and chol­era did be­fore. Powers are arising therein, which the scur­ry­ing pass­ersby of the 19th cen­tury could not have dreamed of. Every­one must al­ways be plan­ning some­thing. Free-time is re­quired to be ex­hausted. It is planned, em­ployed for un­der­tak­ings, filled up with the visit of every pos­sible in­sti­tu­tion or through the fast­est pos­sible lo­co­motion. The shadow of this falls on in­tel­lec­tual labor. It takes place with a bad con­science, as if it were moon­light­ing from some sort of ur­gent, al­beit purely ima­gin­ary oc­cu­pa­tion. In or­der to jus­tify its own activ­ity to it­self, it ad­opts the ges­tures of what is hec­tic, un­der high pres­sure, of the en­ter­prise ra­cing against the clock, of every sens­ib­il­ity -- in­clud­ing it­self -- which stands in its way. Of­ten it seems as if in­tel­lec­tu­als re­served for their own pro­duc­tion only the hours left over from ob­lig­a­tions, ex­cur­sions, ap­point­ments and un­avoid­able pleas­ures. The ac­cu­mu­la­tion of prestige by those who can present them­selves as so im­port­ant, that they must be every­where, is re­puls­ive, and yet to some ex­tent ra­tional. They styl­ize their life with in­ten­tion­ally hammed-up dis­sat­is­fac­tion as a single ]{.calibre3}[acte de présence]{.calibre22}[ \[French: act of pres­ence\]. The joy with which they re­ject an in­vit­a­tion by re­fer­ring to a prior en­gage­ment, an­nounces a tri­umph in the com­pet­i­tion. Sim­il­arly, the forms of the pro­duc­tion-pro­cess are re­peated more gen­er­ally in private life or in the forms ex­cluded from realms of labor. One's en­tire life is sup­posed to look like an oc­cu­pa­tion, and to hide, through this sim­il­ar­ity, any­thing not yet im­me­di­ately ded­ic­ated to com­merce. Yet the fear thereby ex­pressed, only re­flects a much deeper one. The un­con­scious in­nerv­a­tions which har­mon­ize the in­di­vidual ex­ist­ence to the his­tor­ical rhythm, bey­ond thought-pro­cesses, have an ink­ling of the dawn­ing col­lect­iv­iz­a­tion of the world. Since how­ever the in­teg­ral so­ci­ety does not sub­late in­di­vidu­als pos­it­ively in it­self, but rather squeezes them into an amorph­ous and pli­able mass, every in­di­vidual dreads this as the pro­cess of be­ing ab­sorbed, some­thing ex­per­i­enced as in­ev­it­able. "Do­ing things and go­ing places" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] is the sen­sorium's at­tempt to cre­ate a kind of pro­tect­ive stim­u­lus against a threat­en­ing col­lect­iv­iz­a­tion, to get used to the lat­ter, by school­ing one­self in the hours ap­par­ently left in free­dom to be a mem­ber of the masses. The strategy therein is to outdo the danger. One lives to a cer­tain ex­tent even worse, that is with still less of an ego, than one can ex­pect to live. At the same time one learns, through the play­ful ex­cess of giv­ing up the self, that for someone who in all ser­i­ous­ness lives without an ego, things can be easier in­stead of harder. It all goes very fast, be­cause there is no alarm for earth­quakes. Those who do not play along, and that's as much to say, those who do not swim bod­ily in the stream of hu­man be­ings, be­come afraid of miss­ing the bus and draw­ing the re­venge of the col­lect­ive down on them­selves, rather like en­ter­ing a to­tal­it­arian party all too late. Pseudo­activ­ity is a re-in­sur­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Rück­ver­sicher­ung]{.calibre22}[: re­in­sur­ance, a sec­ond­ary in­sur­ance cov­er­ing a set of ori­ginal in­sur­ance policies\], the ex­pres­sion of pre­par­a­tion for self-sac­ri­fice, in which alone one has an ink­ling of a guar­an­tee of self-pre­ser­va­tion. Se­cur­ity beck­ons in the ad­apt­a­tion to the most ex­treme in­sec­ur­ity. It is con­ceived of as a flight charter, which brings one as quickly as pos­sible some­place else. In the fan­at­ical love of autos, the feel­ing of phys­ical home­less­ness res­on­ates. It is the found­a­tion of what the bour­geoisie in­ac­cur­ately called the flight from one­self, from the in­ner void. Who­ever wants to come along, may not be dif­fer­ent. The psy­cho­lo­gical void is it­self only the res­ult of false so­cial ab­sorp­tion. The bore­dom from which hu­man be­ings flee, merely mir­rors the pro­cess of run­ning away, in which they have long been caught. For that reason alone the mon­strous ap­par­atus of pleas­ure stays alive and swells lar­ger and lar­ger, without a single per­son get­ting pleas­ure from such. It can­al­izes the com­pul­sion to be at the scene, which would oth­er­wise grab the col­lect­ive by the throat, in­dis­crim­in­ately, an­arch­ic­ally, as promis­cu­ity or wild ag­gres­sion -- a col­lect­ive which, at the same time, nev­er­the­less con­sists of no-one else than those who are un­der­way. They are most closely re­lated to the ad­dict. Their im­pulse re­acts ex­actly to the dis­lo­ca­tion of hu­man­ity, which leads from the murky blur­ring of the dif­fer­ence between city and coun­try, the ab­ol­i­tion of the house, via the move­ment of mil­lions of un­em­ployed, all the way to the de­port­a­tions and mass up­root­ing of peoples in the des­troyed European con­tin­ent. The nullity and lack of con­tent of all col­lect­ive rituals since the youth-move­ment rep­res­ents ret­ro­spect­ively the grop­ing an­ti­cip­a­tion of over­power­ing his­tor­ical ham­mer-blows. The myri­ads who sud­denly fall prey to their own ab­stract quant­ity and mo­bil­ity, to hit­ting the road in swarms, like a drug, are re­cruits of the move­ment of peoples, in whose feral realms bour­geois his­tory is get­ting ready to end.]{.calibre3}

[Pic­ture-book without pic­tures]{.calibre22}[. -- The ob­ject­ive tend­ency of the en­light­en­ment, to ab­ol­ish the power of all im­ages over hu­man be­ings, does not cor­res­pond to any sub­ject­ive pro­gress of en­lightened thought to­wards im­age­less­ness. After the idols were cast down, and meta­phys­ical ideas ir­res­ist­ibly de­mol­ished con­cepts pre­vi­ous un­der­stood as ra­tional and au­then­tic­ally thought, the think­ing un­leashed by the en­light­en­ment and im­mun­ized against think­ing is passing over into a second rep­res­ent­at­ive­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Bild­lich­keit]{.calibre22}[\], an im­age­less and biased one. Amidst a net of re­la­tion­ships in which hu­man be­ings have be­come en­tirely ab­stract to each other and to things, the ca­pa­city of ab­strac­tion dis­ap­pears. The ali­en­a­tion of schemata and clas­si­fic­a­tions from the data sub­sumed un­der them, in­deed the pure quant­ity of pro­cessed ma­ter­i­als, which has be­come in­com­men­sur­able to the cir­cum­fer­ence of in­di­vidual hu­man ex­per­i­ence, con­stantly ne­ces­sit­ates the ar­chaic re­trans­la­tion into sen­su­ous signs. The little stick fig­ures and houses, scattered in stat­ist­ical texts like hiero­glyph­ics, may ap­pear in every spe­cific case to be ac­ci­dental, a mere means of as­sist­ance. But it is not for noth­ing that they look so sim­ilar to count­less ad­vert­ise­ments, news­pa­per ste­reo­types, and toys. In them the rep­res­ent­a­tion is vic­tori­ous over what is rep­res­en­ted. Its out­sized, simplistic and thus false com­pre­hens­ib­il­ity re­in­forces the in­com­pre­hens­ib­il­ity of the in­tel­lec­tual pro­cesses, from which their false­ness -- the blind, non-con­cep­tual sub­sump­tion -- can­not be sep­ar­ated. Ubi­quit­ous pic­tures are noth­ing of the sort, be­cause they sim­ul­tan­eously present the en­tire gen­er­al­ity, the av­er­age, the stand­ard model as some­thing unique, some­thing par­tic­u­lar, while ri­dicul­ing such. Even the ab­ol­i­tion of the par­tic­u­lar is de­ris­ively turned into some­thing par­tic­u­lar. The de­mand for this has already sed­i­men­ted it­self as a need, and is re­pro­duced every­where by the mass cul­ture, after the model of the "fun­nies" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]. What was once called Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], is dis­pelled by the il­lus­tra­tion. It is not merely that hu­man be­ings no longer have the ca­pa­city to ima­gine what has not been drilled into them and shown in ab­bre­vi­ated form. Even the joke, in which at one time the free­dom of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] crashed into the facts and caused the lat­ter to ex­plode, has passed over into il­lus­tra­tion. The pictorial jokes which fill the magazines, are for the most part point­less, empty of mean­ing. They con­sist of noth­ing other than a chal­lenge to the eye of a com­pet­i­tion with the situ­ation. Schooled by in­nu­mer­able prior cases, one is sup­posed to see "what's hap­pen­ing" faster than the sig­ni­fic­ant mo­ments of the situ­ation are de­vel­op­ing. What such pic­tures act out, in an­ti­cip­a­tion of their com­ple­tion by the well-versed ob­server, is the throw­ing of all mean­ing over­board like bal­last in the snap­shot of the situ­ation, in the un­res­ist­ing sub­jug­a­tion to the empty he­ge­mony of things. The state-of-the-art joke is the sui­cide of in­ten­tion. Who­ever com­mits it, is re­war­ded by ac­cept­ance in the col­lectiv­ity of laughter, which has hor­ri­fy­ing things on its side. Even if one wanted to try to un­der­stand such jokes by think­ing, one would re­main help­lessly be­hind the tempo of un­leashed things, which race ahead even in the simplest ca­ri­ca­ture, like the con­clud­ing chase at the end of an­im­ated films. Saga­city turns im­me­di­ately into stu­pid­ity in the face of re­gress­ive pro­gress. No other un­der­stand­ing is left to thought than the hor­ror of what is in­com­pre­hens­ible. Just as the sober-minded gaze, which meets the bill­board smile of a tooth­paste beauty, per­ceives the misery of tor­ture in her man­u­fac­tured grin, so too does the death-sen­tence of the sub­ject, im­pli­cit in the uni­ver­sal vic­tory of sub­ject­ive reason, bristle from every joke and truly every visual rep­res­ent­a­tion. ]{.calibre3}

If one wished to blindly con­sec­rate the film to the rep­res­ent­a­tion of daily life, for ex­ample on the model of Zola, some­thing which would in fact be pos­sible with the means of mo­bile pho­to­graphy and a sound-track, then the res­ult­ing en­tity \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­bilde]{.calibre22}[\] would be dif­fuse, ex­tern­ally un­ar­tic­u­lated, for­eign to a pub­lic ac­cus­tomed to visual spec­tacles. Rad­ical nat­ur­al­ism, which the tech­nique of film strongly sug­gests, would dis­solve every con­text of sur­face mean­ing and end up as the ex­treme op­pos­ite of fa­mil­iar real­ism. The film would pass over into the as­so­ci­at­ive stream of im­ages and re­ceive its form solely as in their pure, im­man­ent con­struc­tion. Yet if in­stead of this, one at­temp­ted to choose words and ges­tures which could be re­lated to an idea en­dow­ing them with mean­ing -- either on com­mer­cial grounds, or for the sake of ob­ject­ive in­ten­tion -- the per­haps un­avoid­able at­tempt would end up in an equally un­avoid­able con­tra­dic­tion with the pre­requis­ites of nat­ur­al­ism. The lesser dens­ity of re­pro­du­cib­il­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Ab­bild­lich­keit]{.calibre22}[\] in nat­ur­al­istic lit­er­at­ure still left room for in­ten­tion: in the seam­less mesh of the du­plic­a­tion of real­ity through the tech­nical ap­par­atus of film, every in­ten­tion, even if it were it­self the truth, turns into a lie. When com­pared with the lit­eral fi­del­ity of the copy \[]{.calibre3}[Ab­bild]{.calibre22}[\], the word which is sup­posed to beat the char­ac­ter of the speaker or the mean­ing of the whole into the audi­ence's head sounds "un­nat­ural." It jus­ti­fies the world as be­ing as mean­ing­ful as it­self, even be­fore the first planned fraud, the first ac­tual dis­tor­tion is com­mit­ted. No-one talks that way, no-one moves that way, while the film urges over and over again, that's how every­one does it. One is trapped: con­form­ism is caused a pri­ori by mean­ing \[]{.calibre3}[Bedeu­ten]{.calibre22}[: noun form of the verb "bedeu­ten," to mean\] in it­self, re­gard­less of what the con­crete sig­ni­fic­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Bedeu­tung]{.calibre22}[: noun form of "mean­ing\"\] may be, while it is non­ethe­less only through mean­ing \[]{.calibre3}[Bedeu­ten]{.calibre22}[\] that con­form­ism, the re­spect­able re­pe­ti­tion of what is fac­tual, could be shaken. True in­ten­tions would be pos­sible only through the re­nun­ci­ation of in­ten­tion. That this lat­ter and real­ism are in­com­pat­ible, that the syn­thesis turned into a lie, is rooted in the concept of mean­ing­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Deut­igkeit]{.calibre22}[: mean­ing, sig­ni­fic­ance\]. It is am­bigu­ous \[]{.calibre3}[zweideutig]{.calibre22}[\]. It relates without dis­tinc­tion to the or­gan­iz­a­tion of the thing as such and to its trans­mis­sion to the audi­ence. This am­bi­gu­ity how­ever is no ac­ci­dent. Mean­ing­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Deut­igkeit]{.calibre22}[\] in­dic­ates the point of in­dif­fer­ence between ob­ject­ive reason and com­mu­nic­a­tion. It is right, in­so­far as the ob­ject­ive form, the real­ized ex­pres­sion, speaks, turn­ing it­self out­wards out of it­self, and wrong, in­so­far as it dam­ages the form through cal­cu­la­tions aimed at the audi­ence.

[Hue and cry ]{.calibre22}[\[]{.calibre3}[Staat­sak­tion]{.calibre22}[: great fuss\]. -- The in­creas­ing im­possib­il­ity of the rep­res­ent­a­tion of what is his­tor­ical speaks to the ex­tinc­tion of art. That there is no ad­equate drama on fas­cism, is due not to a lack of tal­ent, rather tal­ent is with­er­ing away due to the in­sol­ubil­ity of the most ur­gent task fa­cing writers. They have to choose between two prin­ciples, which are equally in­ap­pro­pri­ate to the sub­ject-mat­ter: psy­cho­logy and in­fant­il­ism. The former, which has mean­while be­come aes­thet­ic­ally ob­sol­ete, has been handled by sig­ni­fic­ant artists as a trick and with a bad con­science, ever since mod­ern drama learned to see its ob­ject in polit­ics. Schiller's pro­logue to ]{.calibre3}[Fi­esco]{.calibre22}[ states: "If it is true, that only sen­ti­ment awakens sen­ti­ment, then the polit­ical hero is not, I think, an ap­pro­pri­ate sub­ject for the theater, to the ex­tent that he must set aside the hu­man be­ing, in or­der to be the polit­ical hero. It was not my in­tent to breathe that liv­ing glow into my tale, which rules through the vo­cal product of en­thu­si­asm, but to spin the cold, un­fruit­ful hue and cry \[]{.calibre3}[Staat­sak­tion]{.calibre22}[\] out of the hu­man heart, and pre­cisely thereby to reat­tach it to the hu­man heart -- to in­volve the man through the head, which knows the af­fairs of the state -- to bor­row situ­ations for hu­man­ity from in­vent­ive in­trigues -- that was my in­tent. In ad­di­tion, my re­la­tion­ship with the bour­geois world made me more fa­mil­iar with the heart, than with the cab­inet of state, and per­haps this pre­cise polit­ical weak­ness has be­come a po­etic strength." Hardly. The link between ali­en­ated his­tory and the hu­man heart was already a pre­text in Schiller, to jus­tify the in­hu­man­ity of his­tory as hu­manly com­pre­hens­ible, and was given the the­at­rical lie, whenever the tech­nique equated the "man" to the "head, which knows the af­fairs of the state" -- for ex­ample, in the buf­foon­ish-ac­ci­dental murder of Le­onore by the be­trayer of his own con­spir­acy. The tend­ency to aes­thetic reprivat­iz­a­tion pulls the rug from un­der­neath the feet of art, while it at­tempts to con­serve hu­man­ism. The cabals of the all too well con­struc­ted plays of Schiller are power­less in­ter­me­di­ary con­struc­tions between the pas­sions of hu­man be­ings and a so­cial and polit­ical real­ity which is already in­com­men­sur­able with such, and for that reason no longer grasp­able in hu­man mo­tiv­a­tions. The most re­cent sign of this is the craze for second-rate bio­graph­ies, which bring fam­ous people closer as non-fam­ously hu­man. The same pres­sure for false hu­man­iz­a­tion emerges in the cal­cu­lated re­in­tro­duc­tion of "plots" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], of the ac­tion as a har­mo­ni­ous, lo­gic­ally con­sist­ent con­text of mean­ing. Un­der the pre­requis­ites of pho­to­graphic real­ism, this would be un­ten­able in film. To ca­pri­cious re­store it, is to fall be­hind the ex­per­i­ences of the great nov­els, on which film para­sit­ic­ally lives; they ob­tained their mean­ing pre­cisely as the dis­sol­u­tion of the con­text of mean­ing.]{.calibre3}

[If one wished to clear the table of all this and seek to rep­res­ent the polit­ical sphere in its ab­strac­tion and ex­tra-hu­man­ity, ex­clud­ing the de­cept­ive me­di­ations of what is in­tern­al­ized, then things would go no bet­ter. For it is pre­cisely the es­sen­tial ab­strac­tion of what truly happened, which simply re­futes the aes­thetic pic­ture. In or­der to make it cap­able of any kind of ex­pres­sion, the writer is com­pelled to trans­late it into a kind of chil­dren's speech, into ar­che­types and thus to "bring it nearer" a second time around -- no longer to feel­ing, but to that au­thor­ity of com­pre­hend­ing re­flec­tion which still lies be­fore the con­sti­tu­tion of lan­guage, which even epic theater can­not evade. The ap­peal to these au­thor­it­ies already form­ally sanc­tions the dis­sol­u­tion of the sub­ject in col­lect­ive so­ci­ety. The ob­ject how­ever is scarcely less fals­i­fied by such a labor of trans­la­tion than the de­duc­tion of a re­li­gious war to the erotic needs of a queen. Hu­man be­ings today have be­come as in­fant­ile as the simplistic drama, which ab­jures the former's rep­res­ent­a­tion. In lieu of this, the polit­ical eco­nomy which the lat­ter charges it­self with rep­res­ent­ing, though in prin­ciple un­changed, is nev­er­the­less so dif­fer­en­ti­ated and ad­vanced in each of its mo­ments, that it evades schem­atic par­ables. To paint the de­cision-mak­ing in­side large-scale in­dustry as the wheel­ing and deal­ing of crooked ve­get­able-gro­cers suf­fices for a mon­et­ary shock, but not how­ever for dia­lect­ical theater. The il­lus­tra­tion of late cap­it­al­ism through pic­tures from the agrarian or crim­inal store­house does not al­low the mis­chief of today's so­ci­ety to emerge from its wrap­ping in com­plic­ated phe­nom­ena. Rather, the lack of con­cern for the phe­nom­ena, which them­selves would need to be de­veloped out of the es­sence, dis­torts the es­sence. It in­ter­prets the con­quest of power by the migh­ti­est harm­lessly, as mach­in­a­tion of rack­ets out­side of so­ci­ety, not as the com­ing-to-it­self of so­ci­ety in its own right. The un­rep­res­ent­ab­il­ity of fas­cism how­ever stems from the fact that there is as little free­dom of the sub­ject any­more in such, as there is in the re­flec­tion on it. Con­sum­mated un­free­dom can be re­cog­nized, not rep­res­en­ted. Where free­dom ap­pears as a motive in polit­ical stor­ies today, as for ex­ample in the praise of heroic res­ist­ance, it has the shame­ful qual­ity of a power­less re­as­sur­ance. The out­come al­ways ends up be­ing de­term­ined by world polit­ics, and free­dom it­self emerges as ideo­lo­gical, as a speech about free­dom, with ste­reo­typ­ical de­clam­a­tions, not in hu­manly com­men­sur­able ac­tions. After the dis­sol­u­tion of the sub­ject, art is least of all to be saved by be­ing stuffed by a taxi­derm­ist, and the ob­ject which today would alone be worthy of it, namely what is purely in­hu­man, es­capes it through both a lack of meas­ure and in­hu­man­ity.]{.calibre3}

[Damper and drum. -- ]{.calibre22}[Taste is the truest seis­mo­graph of his­tor­ical ex­per­i­ence. Like scarcely any other fac­ulty, it is cap­able of in­dic­at­ing even its own be­ha­vior. It re­acts against it­self and re­cog­nizes it­self as taste­less. Artists, who re­pel, who shock, spokes­per­sons of un­mit­ig­ated cruelty, are steered in their idio­syn­crasy by taste: the genre of the finer things in life, the do­main of neo-Ro­mantic nervous types, the cul­tiv­a­tion of sens­ib­il­ity, is -- even to their prot­ag­on­ists -- as coarse and clue­less nowadays as the Rilke verse, "For poverty is a great lu­min­os­ity from within\..." The del­ic­ate shud­der, the pathos of be­ing dif­fer­ent are only nor­mal­ized masks in the cult of op­pres­sion. It is pre­cisely the aes­thet­ic­ally ad­vanced nerves which find what is self-right­eously aes­thetic to be un­bear­able. The in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] is so through and through his­tor­ical, that it is cap­able of re­belling against the fine threads of its late-bour­geois or­gan­iz­a­tion with the fine threads of late-bour­geois or­gan­iz­a­tion. In the an­ti­pathy to­wards all artistic sub­ject­iv­ism, to­wards ex­pres­sion and soul­ful­ness, the flesh creeps at the lack of his­tor­ical tact, no dif­fer­ently from how sub­ject­iv­ism once drew back from bour­geois con­ven­tion. Even the re­jec­tion of mimesis, the in­ner­most con­cern of func­tion­al­ism, is mi­metic. The judg­ment on the sub­ject­ive ex­pres­sion does not fall from out­side, in polit­ical-so­cial re­flec­tion, but in im­me­di­ate im­pulses, every one of which turns its coun­ten­ance from the im­age in the mir­ror, com­pelled in view of the cul­ture-in­dustry to shame. Right at the top is the de­fam­a­tion of erotic pathos, which the dis­place­ment of lyric ac­cents test­i­fies to not less than the sexu­al­ity in the works of Kafka, which stands un­der a col­lect­ive bale­ful spell. In art since ex­pres­sion­ism, the whore has be­come a key fig­ure, while she is dy­ing out in real­ity, be­cause it is solely in what is shame­less that sexu­al­ity can be de­pic­ted without aes­thetic shame. Such dis­place­ments of the deep­est modes of re­ac­tion have reached the point, that art in its in­di­vidu­al­istic form has de­cayed, without mak­ing its col­lect­ive form pos­sible. It is not a ques­tion of the fi­del­ity and in­de­pend­ence of in­di­vidual artists, to un­flinch­ingly hold fast to the sphere of the ex­press­ive and to op­pose the bru­tal com­pul­sion of col­lect­iv­iz­a­tion, it is rather that they must feel this com­pul­sion even in the most secret cells of their isol­a­tion, even against their will, if they do not wish to help­lessly and un­truth­fully re­main, through an ana­chron­istic hu­man­ity, be­hind what is in­hu­man. Even in­transigent lit­er­ary ex­pres­sion­ism, the lyr­ics of Stramm, the dra­mas of Kokoschka, have a na­ive, lib­eral-trust­ful as­pect as the flip side of their genu­ine rad­ic­al­ism. The ad­vance bey­ond them how­ever is no less du­bi­ous. Works of art which con­sciously wish to re­move the harm­less­ness of ab­so­lute sub­jectiv­ity, thereby raise the claim of a pos­it­ive com­munity, which is not present in them­selves, but which is ar­bit­rar­ily cited. That turns them into mere mouth­pieces of doom and to the prey of the fi­nal ]{.calibre3}[naïvété]{.calibre22}[, which sub­lates them -- of still be­ing art at all. The aporia of the re­spons­ible work comes to be­ne­fit ir­re­spons­ible ones. If there comes a time that the nerves are en­tirely ab­ol­ished, then there will be no cure against the renais­sance of the spring­time of song, and noth­ing will stand in the way of the pop­u­lar front stretch­ing from bar­baric fu­tur­ism to the ideo­logy of the film.]{.calibre3}

[Janus palace]{.calibre22}[. -- If one were so in­clined as to put the sys­tem of the cul­ture-in­dustry in a grand, world-his­tor­ical per­spect­ive, then it would be defined as the planned ex­ploit­a­tion of the age-old di­vide between hu­man be­ings and their cul­ture. The double char­ac­ter of pro­gress, which con­stantly de­veloped the po­ten­tial of free­dom sim­ul­tan­eously with the real­ity of op­pres­sion, has cre­ated a situ­ation where the vari­ous peoples are ever more com­pletely sub­orned into the con­trol of nature and so­cial or­gan­iz­a­tion, yet are at the same time in­cap­able of un­der­stand­ing how cul­ture goes bey­ond such in­teg­ra­tion, due to the com­pul­sion which cul­ture in­flicts on them. What is hu­man in cul­ture -- what is nearest of all, which rep­res­ents their own af­fair against the world -- has be­come alien to hu­man be­ings. They make com­mon cause with the world against them­selves, and what is most ali­en­ated of all -- the ubi­quity of goods, their own re­con­fig­ur­a­tion into ap­pend­ages of ma­chinery -- turns into the de­cept­ive im­age of near­ness. The great works of art and philo­soph­ical con­struc­tions have re­mained un­com­pre­hen­ded not be­cause of their all too great dis­tance from the core of hu­man ex­per­i­ence, but for the op­pos­ite, and it is easy enough to trace the in­com­pre­hen­sion back to an all too great un­der­stand­ing: the shame of par­ti­cip­a­tion in uni­ver­sal in­justice, which would be­come over­power­ing, as soon as one per­mit­ted one­self to un­der­stand it. Thus they cling to what mocks them, by con­firm­ing the mu­til­ated form of their es­sence through the smooth­ness of its own ap­pear­ance. Dur­ing all peri­ods of urban civil­iz­a­tion, the lack­eys of the ex­ist­ent have made a para­sitic liv­ing off such un­avoid­able de­lu­sion: the later At­tic com­edy, the Hel­len­istic arts and crafts are already kitsch, al­though they did not yet have the tech­nics of mech­an­ical re­pro­du­cib­il­ity and that in­dus­trial ap­par­atus at their dis­posal, whose Ur-pic­ture seems to be con­jured up by the ru­ins of Pom­peii. If one reads hun­dred-year-old en­ter­tain­ment nov­els like those of Cooper, then one finds therein in rudi­ment­ary form the en­tire Hol­ly­wood schema. The stag­na­tion of the cul­ture in­dustry is prob­ably not the res­ult of its mono­pol­iz­a­tion, but was in­nate to so-called en­ter­tain­ment from the very be­gin­ning. Kitsch is that mesh of in­vari­ants, which the philo­soph­ical lie ascribes to its sol­emn designs. Noth­ing therein may fun­da­ment­ally change, be­cause the en­tire non­sense drills it into hu­man­ity, that noth­ing is al­lowed to change. So long how­ever the course of civil­iz­a­tion pro­ceeded plan­lessly and an­onym­ously, the ob­ject­ive Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] has not been con­scious of that bar­baric ele­ment, as some­thing which ne­ces­sar­ily dwells within it. Un­der the il­lu­sion of im­me­di­ately aid­ing free­dom, where it me­di­ated dom­in­a­tion, it has at least dis­dained to im­me­di­ately con­trib­ute to its re­pro­duc­tion. It de­famed the kitsch which ac­com­pan­ied it like a shadow, with an en­thu­si­asm which to be sure ex­presses the bad con­science of high cul­ture -- a high cul­ture which sus­pects that un­der dom­in­a­tion it is noth­ing of the sort, and which is re­minded by kitsch of its own mis­chief. Today, since the con­scious­ness of the rulers is be­gin­ning to con­verge with the total tend­ency of so­ci­ety, the ten­sion between cul­ture and kitsch is fall­ing apart. Cul­ture no longer drags its des­pised op­pon­ent be­hind it power­lessly, but takes it un­der dir­ec­tion. By ad­min­is­ter­ing the whole of hu­man­ity, it ad­min­is­ters too the break between hu­man­ity and cul­ture. Even the crudity, pig-headed­ness and nar­row­ness, which are ob­ject­ively in­flic­ted on the dom­in­ated, are ac­cessed with sub­ject­ive sov­er­eignty as hu­mor. Noth­ing in­dic­ates the sim­ul­tan­eously in­teg­ral and ant­ag­on­istic con­di­tion more ex­actly than such em­bed­ding of bar­bar­ism. Therein how­ever the will of the ad­min­is­trat­ors can call upon the will of the world. Their mass so­ci­ety did not first pro­duce junk for cus­tom­ers, but the cus­tom­ers them­selves. These lat­ter hungered for films, ra­dio and magazines; whatever in them re­mained un­sat­is­fied by the so­cial or­der, which takes from them without giv­ing back what it prom­ises, have pined only for the mas­ter of the dun­geon to re­mem­ber them and fi­nally of­fer with the left hand a stone for the hun­ger, from which the right hand with­holds the bread. Un­res­ist­ingly, for a quarter cen­tury, eld­erly bour­geois who ought to know bet­ter have been run­ning over to the cul­ture-in­dustry, which has so pre­cisely cal­cu­lated their starving hearts. They have no reason to be out­raged over the young people who were cor­rup­ted to the mar­row by Fas­cism. Those who are sub­ject­less, those who are cul­tur­ally de­prived of their her­it­age are the true in­her­it­ors of cul­ture.]{.calibre3}

[Monad]{.calibre22}[. -- The in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] owes its crys­tal­liz­a­tion to the forms of polit­ical eco­nomy, es­pe­cially the urban mar­ket­place \[]{.calibre3}[Mark­t­wesen]{.calibre22}[\]. Even as an op­pon­ent of the pres­sure of so­cial­iz­a­tion, it re­mains the lat­ter's own product and sim­ilar to it. What en­dows it with res­ist­ance, with every trait of in­de­pend­ence, ori­gin­ates in the mon­ad­o­lo­gical in­di­vidual in­terest and its pre­cip­it­ate as char­ac­ter. The in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] mir­rors pre­cisely in its in­di­vidu­ation the pre­or­dained so­cial law of ex­ploit­a­tion, be it ever so me­di­ated. This test­i­fies how­ever also to the fact that its de­cay in the con­tem­por­ary phase must not be de­rived in­di­vidu­al­ist­ic­ally, but out of a so­cial tend­ency, as some­thing which suc­ceeds by vir­tue of in­di­vidu­ation and not as its mere en­emy. Therein di­verges the re­ac­tion­ary cri­tique of cul­ture from the other kinds. Of­ten enough, the re­ac­tion­ary kind achieves a cer­tain in­sight into the de­cay of in­di­vidu­al­ity and the crisis of so­ci­ety, but puts the on­to­lo­gical re­spons­ib­il­ity for that on the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] in it­self, as some­thing de­tached and in­ward: the ob­jec­tion of su­per­fi­ci­al­ity, lack of be­lievab­il­ity, lack of sub­stance are the last words they have to say, and turn­ing back is their only con­sol­a­tion. In­di­vidu­al­ists like Hux­ley and Jaspers con­demn the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] for its mech­an­ical empti­ness and neur­otic weak­ness, but the up­shot of their con­dem­na­tion is to sac­ri­fice it rather than to cri­tique the so­cial ]{.calibre3}[prin­cipium in­di­vidu­ationis]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: prin­ciple of in­di­vidu­ation\]. Their po­lemic is, as a half truth, already the en­tire un­truth. So­ci­ety is re­garded therein as the im­me­di­ate co­ex­ist­ence of hu­man be­ings, out of whose at­ti­tude fol­lows the whole, as it were, in­stead of as a sys­tem, which does not merely em­brace and de­form them, but reaches even into that hu­man­ity, which once or­dained them as in­di­vidu­als. Through the uni­ver­sally-hu­man in­ter­pret­a­tion of con­di­tions, as they are, the crude ma­ter­i­al­ity which binds hu­man ex­ist­ence to in­hu­man­ity is cer­ti­fied, even in the com­plaint against such. In its bet­ter days, the bour­geoisie, where it re­flec­ted his­tor­ic­ally, was quite con­scious of such in­ter­woven­ness, and only since its doc­trine de­gen­er­ated to the stub­born apo­lo­get­ics against so­cial­ism, have they for­got­ten about them. Not the least of the achieve­ments of Jakob Burck­hardt's Greek cul­tural his­tory is that to have linked the erosion of Hel­len­istic in­di­vidu­al­ity not merely to the ob­ject­ive de­cay of the polis, but pre­cisely to the cult of the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\]: "Fol­low­ing the deaths of De­mos­thenes and Phokion, the city \[Athens\] was as­ton­ish­ingly poor in polit­ical per­son­al­it­ies, and not merely in polit­ical ones, for Epi­curus, born in 342 to an At­tic cleruch fam­ily in Samos, was the last world-his­tor­ical Athenian of them all." (Jakob Burck­hardt, Vol. 4.3. Ed., Stut­tgart 1909, pg 515). The con­di­tion, in which the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] dis­ap­peared, is sim­ul­tan­eously one of un­fettered in­di­vidu­al­ism, in which "everything is pos­sible": "Above all, in­di­vidu­als are cel­eb­rated in­stead of gods." (Ibid., pg 516). That the free­ing of the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] by the hol­lowed out polis did not strengthen its res­ist­ance, but elim­in­ated it and in­deed in­di­vidu­al­ity it­self, as tran­spired in the dic­tator-states, is the model of one of the cent­ral con­tra­dic­tions which drove from the 19th cen­tury to­wards fas­cism. Beeth­oven's mu­sic, whose set­ting con­sists of so­cially com­mu­nic­ated forms, and which, as­cet­ic­ally op­posed to the private ex­pres­sion of feel­ing, res­on­ates with the de­term­in­ately guided echo of struggle, draw­ing pre­cisely out of such as­ceti­cism all the rich­ness and might \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­walt]{.calibre22}[\] of the in­di­vidual. Those of Richard Strauss, en­tirely at the ser­vice of in­di­vidual claim and dir­ec­ted to­wards the glor­i­fic­a­tion of the self-suf­fi­cient in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\], de­bases such to the mere re­cep­tion-or­gan of the mar­ket, to the emu­lator of ideas and styles se­lec­ted willy-nilly. In­side re­press­ive so­ci­ety, the eman­cip­a­tion of the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] does not merely be­ne­fit such, but also re­duces it to an entry. Free­dom from so­ci­ety robs it of the en­ergy for free­dom. For as real as its re­la­tions to oth­ers may be, it is, con­sidered as some­thing ab­so­lute, a mere ab­strac­tion. It does not have any sort of con­tent which is not so­cially con­sti­tuted, nor any im­pulse which goes bey­ond so­ci­ety, which would not be aimed at get­ting the so­cial con­di­tion to go bey­ond it­self. Even the Chris­tian doc­trine of death and im­mor­tal­ity, in which the no­tion of ab­so­lute in­di­vidu­al­ity is groun­ded, would be en­tirely void, if it did not in­clude hu­man­ity. The in­di­vidual who hoped for im­mor­tal­ity ab­so­lutely and for them­selves alone, would in such lim­it­a­tion only en­large the prin­ciple of self-pre­ser­va­tion into the ab­surdity, on which the wis­dom "one must lose, in or­der to win" is the cor­rect­ive. So­cially the ab­so­l­u­tiz­a­tion of the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] marks the trans­ition from the uni­ver­sal me­di­ation of so­cial re­la­tion­ships, which as ex­change also con­stantly de­mands the sim­ul­tan­eous lim­it­a­tion of the in­terests real­ized in such, to im­me­di­ate dom­in­a­tion, where the strongest rules. Through this dis­sol­u­tion of everything me­di­at­ing in the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] it­self, by vir­tue of which it was still a piece of a so­cial sub­ject, it is im­pov­er­ished, bru­tal­ized and re­gresses to the con­di­tion of a mere so­cial ob­ject. The in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] sub­lates it­self, as in the Hegel­ian sense, in some­thing ab­stractly real­ized: the myri­ads who know noth­ing any more ex­cept their na­ked, ram­bling in­terest, are the same ones who ca­pit­u­late as soon as or­gan­iz­a­tion and ter­ror rope them in. If today the trace of what is hu­man seems to cling solely to the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] as some­thing which is per­ish­ing, then it is a warn­ing to put an end to that fatal­ity, which in­di­vidu­ates hu­man be­ings solely in or­der to be able to com­pletely break them in their sep­ar­a­tion.

Through the sol­it­ary domin­ion of the neg­a­tion, the move­ment of thought, like that of his­tory, is led un­equi­voc­ally and ex­clus­ively ac­cord­ing to the schemata of the im­man­ent con­tra­dic­tion, with im­plac­able pos­it­iv­ity. Everything is sub­sumed by the his­tor­ic­ally ap­pro­pri­ate ma­jor eco­nomic phases of the en­tire so­ci­ety and their de­vel­op­ment: the en­tire think­ing pro­cess has some­thing of what the Parisian artists called the ]{.calibre3}[genre chef d\'oeuvre ]{.calibre22}[\[French: genre of the mas­ter­piece\]. That the calam­ity is caused pre­cisely by the strin­gency of such de­vel­op­ment, that this lat­ter is linked to dom­in­a­tion, is at any rate not ex­pli­cit in crit­ical the­ory \[i.e. Marx\], which, like the tra­di­tional one \[i.e. Hegel\], ex­pec­ted sal­va­tion from lin­ear pro­gres­sion. In fact strin­gency and to­tal­ity, the bour­geois thought-ideals of ne­ces­sity and gen­er­al­ity, cir­cum­scribe the for­mu­la­tion of his­tory, yet for that very reason re­flect the con­sti­tu­tion of so­ci­ety in the fixed, stately, grand con­cepts, against which dia­lect­ical cri­tique and praxis are aimed. If Ben­jamin ob­served that his­tory had been hitherto writ­ten from the stand­point of the vic­tor and needed to be writ­ten from that of the van­quished, then it should be ad­ded that while know­ledge \[]{.calibre3}[Erken­nt­nis]{.calibre22}[\] must in­deed rep­res­ent the bale­ful lin­ear­ity of the suc­ces­sion of vic­tory and de­feat, it must at the same time turn to whatever does not van­ish in such a dy­namic, and re­mains by the way­side -- to a cer­tain de­gree, the cast-off ma­ter­i­als and blind spots, which es­caped dia­lectics. It is the es­sence of what is van­quished to ap­pear in­es­sen­tial, dis­pens­able, whim­sical in its power­less­ness. What tran­scends the rul­ing so­ci­ety is not merely the po­ten­ti­al­ity de­veloped by the lat­ter, but equally that which does not fit into the his­tor­ical laws of move­ment. The­ory is ori­ented to what is askew, what is im­pen­et­rable, what is not yet en­com­passed, which as such ad­mit­tedly already bears some­thing ana­chron­istic in it­self, but does not ex­haust it­self in what is ob­sol­ete, be­cause it con­tains a dash of the his­tor­ical dy­namic. This is most eas­ily seen in art. Chil­dren's books such as ]{.calibre3}[Alice in Won­der­land]{.calibre22}[ or the ]{.calibre3}[Struwwel­peter]{.calibre22}[, which re­buke any at­tempt to clas­sify them as pro­gress­ive or re­ac­tion­ary as ab­surd, con­tain in­com­par­ably more subtle ciphers, even of his­tory, than the grand dra­mas of Hebbel, with their of­fi­cial them­at­ics of tra­gic guilt, the change of the times, the course of the world and the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\]; and the dis­dain­ful and silly pi­ano pieces of Satie evoke flashes of ex­per­i­ence which the strin­gency of the Schön­berg school, des­pite be­ing backed by the en­tire pathos of mu­sical de­vel­op­ment, can­not dream of. Pre­cisely the mag­ni­fi­cence of lo­gical con­clu­sions may un­wit­tingly as­sume the char­ac­ter of what is pro­vin­cial. Ben­jamin's writ­ings are the at­tempt, in an ever new ap­proach, to make that which is not already de­term­ined by gran­di­ose in­ten­tions philo­soph­ic­ally fruit­ful. His leg­acy con­sists of the task of re­fus­ing to con­sign such an at­tempt to the ali­en­ated puzzle-pic­tures of thought, but to re­cu­per­ate what is devoid of in­ten­tion via the concept: the ne­ces­sity, to think sim­ul­tan­eously dia­lect­ic­ally and un­dia­lect­ic­ally. ]{.calibre3}

[Gold test.]{.calibre22}[ -- Among the con­cepts to which bour­geois mor­al­ity has shrunk, fol­low­ing the dis­sol­u­tion of its re­li­gious norms and the form­al­iz­a­tion of its autonom­ous ones, genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] ranks at the top. If noth­ing else can be strin­gently de­man­ded from hu­man be­ings, then at least, they should be en­tirely and wholly what they are. In the iden­tity of each in­di­vidual with it­self, the pos­tu­late of in­cor­rupt­ible truth as well as the glor­i­fic­a­tion of what is fac­tual are trans­ferred from the en­lightened cog­ni­tion to eth­ics \[]{.calibre3}[Ethik]{.calibre22}[\]. It is pre­cisely the crit­ic­ally in­de­pend­ent thinkers of the late bour­geoisie, fed up with tra­di­tional judg­ments and ideal­istic phrases, who agree with this. Ib­sen's ad­mit­tedly re­fract­ory ver­dict on the lifelong lie, Kierkegaard's doc­trine of ex­ist­ence have made the ideal of genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] into a touch­stone of meta­phys­ics. In Ni­et­z­sche's ana­lysis, the word "genu­ine" already stands as some­thing un­ques­tion­able, some­thing ex­empt from the labor of the concept. To the con­ver­ted and un­con­ver­ted philo­soph­ers of Fas­cism, val­ues such as au­then­ti­city, heroic en­dur­ance of the "thrown­ness" of in­di­vidual ex­ist­ence, the bor­der situ­ation, ul­ti­mately be­come a means of usurp­ing re­li­gious-au­thor­it­arian pathos without any sort of re­li­gious con­tent. This drives to­wards the de­nun­ci­ation of everything which is not sound enough, which is not made out of corn and gristle, there­fore the Jews: Richard Wag­ner hat already played off genu­ine Ger­man art against for­eign \[]{.calibre3}[welsche]{.calibre22}[: me­di­eval Ger­man term for for­eign\] bric-a-brac and thereby mis­used the cri­tique of the cul­ture mar­ket as an apo­logy for bar­bar­ism. Such mis­use is how­ever not ex­trinsic to the concept of genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\]. Dur­ing the sale of its faded liv­ery, seams and dam­aged patches are com­ing out, which were already in­vis­ibly present in the great days of op­pos­i­tion. The un­truth lurks in the sub­strate of genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] it­self, the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\]. If the law of the course of the world is con­cealed in the ]{.calibre3}[prin­cipium in­di­vidu­ationis]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: prin­ciple of in­di­vidu­ation\], as the an­ti­podes of Hegel and Schopen­hauer both re­cog­nized, then the in­tu­ition of the fi­nal and ab­so­lute sub­stan­ti­al­ity of the ego be­comes the vic­tim of an ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\], which pro­tects the ex­ist­ing so­cial or­der, while its es­sence is already de­cay­ing. To equate genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] with truth is not ten­able. It is pre­cisely the un­flinch­ing self-con­sti­tu­tion -- that mode of con­duct, which Ni­et­z­sche called psy­cho­logy -- and thus the in­sist­ence on the truth about one­self, which proves again and again, already in the first ex­per­i­ences of child­hood, that the im­pulses on which one re­flects are not en­tirely "genu­ine." They con­stantly con­tained some­thing of im­it­a­tion, play, want­ing to be dif­fer­ent. In press­ing to­wards what is un­con­di­tion­ally fixed, to­wards the be­ing \[]{.calibre3}[Sein]{.calibre22}[\] of the ex­ist­ent \[]{.calibre3}[Seiendes]{.calibre22}[\], the will, which im­merses it­self in its own self­same in­di­vidu­al­ity in­stead of its so­cial cog­ni­tion, leads to pre­cisely the bad in­fin­ity which since Kierkegaard the concept of genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] was sup­posed to ex­or­cize. No-one ex­pressed this more forth­rightly than Schopen­hauer. The quer­ulous fore­bear of ex­ist­en­tial philo­sophy and ma­li­cious in­her­itor of great spec­u­la­tion truly knew the hol­lows and rav­ines of in­di­vidual ab­so­lut­ism in­side out. His in­sight is at­tached to the spec­u­lat­ive thesis, that the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] would be only the ap­pear­ance, not the thing in it­self. "Every in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\]," goes a foot­note in the fourth book of ]{.calibre3}[The World as Will and Idea]{.calibre22}[, "is on the one hand the sub­ject of cog­ni­tion, that is, the com­ple­ment­ary con­di­tion of pos­sib­il­ity of the en­tire ob­ject­ive world, and on the other hand, the spe­cific ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Er­schein­ung]{.calibre22}[\] of the will, of the same one which ob­jec­ti­fies it­self in each thing. But this du­pli­city of our es­sence does not rest on a unity ex­ist­ing for it­self: oth­er­wise we would be able to be aware of ourselves in ourselves, in­de­pend­ently from the ob­jects of cog­ni­tion and of will \[]{.calibre3}[Wollen]{.calibre22}[\]: this how­ever we simply can­not do, or rather as soon as we try to enter ourselves and, by dir­ect­ing our cog­ni­tion in­wards, wish to fully con­sti­tute ourselves, we lose ourselves in a bot­tom­less void, find­ing ourselves like the crys­tal ball, out of whose depths a voice speaks, whose cause how­ever is not found there, and by wish­ing to grasp ourselves, we catch, with a shud­der, noth­ing but a wan­der­ing ghost. (Schopen­hauer, Col­lec­ted Works, Grand Duke Wil­helm-Ernst Edi­tion, Book 1: ]{.calibre3}[The World as Will and Idea]{.calibre22}[. I. In­tro­duc­tion by Eduard Grise­bach. Leipzig. 1920, pg 371). He thereby called the myth­ical de­cep­tion of the pure self by its name, as nugat­ory. It is an ab­strac­tion. What steps for­ward as an ori­ginal en­tity, as a monad, res­ults first from a so­cial sep­ar­a­tion from the so­cial pro­cess. Pre­cisely as some­thing ab­so­lute, the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] is a mere re­flec­tion-form of prop­erty-re­la­tions. In it the fict­ive claim is raised that what is bio­lo­gic­ally one would pre­cede, ac­cord­ing to its own lights, the so­cial whole, from which only vi­ol­ence isol­ates it, and its con­tin­gency is up­held as a meas­ure of truth. It is not merely that the ego is en­meshed in so­ci­ety, but that the former owes the lat­ter its ex­ist­ence in the most lit­eral sense. All of its con­tent comes from the lat­ter, or in any case out of the re­la­tion to the ob­ject. It be­comes all the richer, the more freely it de­vel­ops the lat­ter in it­self and re­flects it, while con­versely its de­lim­it­a­tion and harden­ing, which re­claims it as an ori­gin, thereby cause it to be lim­ited, im­pov­er­ished and re­duced. It is not for noth­ing that at­tempts to grasp the plen­it­ude of the in­di­vidual in its with­drawal into it­self, such as Kierkegaard's, are tan­tamount to the sac­ri­fice of the in­di­vidual and to the self­same ab­strac­tion, which Kierkegaard ma­ligned in the ideal­istic sys­tems. Genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] is noth­ing other than the de­fi­ant and ob­stin­ate per­sist­ence on the mon­ad­o­lo­gical form, which so­cial op­pres­sion stamps on hu­man be­ings. What does not wish to wither away, should rather take the stigma of the non-genu­ine on it­self. It feeds on the mi­metic leg­acy. What is hu­man is at­tached to im­it­a­tion: a hu­man be­ing turns into a hu­man be­ing first by im­it­at­ing other hu­man be­ings. In such be­ha­vior, the Ur-form of love, the priests of genu­ine­ness scent traces of that uto­pia, which could shake the ap­par­atus of dom­in­a­tion. That Ni­et­z­sche, whose re­flec­tion drove all the way into the concept of truth, dog­mat­ic­ally drew back from genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\], makes him into what he ul­ti­mately wanted to be, a Lutheran, and his out­bursts against play-act­ing are cut from the same cloth as the anti-Semit­ism which so out­raged him in the arch-actor Wag­ner. He should not have re­proached Wag­ner with play-act­ing -- for all art, and mu­sic es­pe­cially, is re­lated to act­ing, and in every period of Ni­et­z­sche there rings the thou­sand-year echo of the rhet­or­ical voices from the Ro­man sen­ate -- but the denial of play-act­ing by the actor. In­deed it is not only what is non-genu­ine, which plays at re­tain­ing be­ing \[]{.calibre3}[sein­shaltig]{.calibre22}[\], which is to be con­victed a lie, but rather what is genu­ine it­self turns into a lie the mo­ment it be­comes some­thing genu­ine, that is to say in the re­flec­tion on it­self, in its pos­it­ing as some­thing genu­ine, such that it already steps bey­ond the iden­tity which in the same breath it claims. The self can­not be spoken of as the on­to­lo­gical ground, but solely in any case theo­lo­gic­ally, in the name of what is cast in God's im­age \[]{.calibre3}[Gotteseben­bild­lich­keit]{.calibre22}[\]. Who­ever holds fast to the self and shakes off theo­lo­gical con­cepts, con­trib­utes to the jus­ti­fic­a­tion of the dev­il­ish pos­it­ive, of cold-cut in­terest. It bor­rows from this last the aura of sig­ni­fic­ance and turns the power of com­mand of self-pre­serving reason into a high-flown su­per­struc­ture, while the real self has already be­come in the world, what Schopen­hauer re­cog­nized it as in in­tro­spec­tion, a ghost. Its char­ac­ter of ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Sche­in­charak­ter]{.calibre22}[\] can be un­der­stood from the his­tor­ical im­plic­a­tions of the concept of genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] as such. In it hides the idea of the su­prem­acy of the ori­gin over what is de­rived. This is how­ever already con­nec­ted with so­cial le­git­im­ism. All rul­ing elites claim to be the eld­est of all, autoch­thon­ous. The en­tire philo­sophy of in­ward­ness, with the claim of hav­ing con­tempt for the world, is the fi­nal sub­lim­a­tion of the bar­baric bru­tal­ity, that who­ever was there first, has the greatest rights, and the pri­or­ity of the self is as un­true as the pri­or­ity of all who feel at home right where they are. Noth­ing changes, if genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] falls back on the op­pos­i­tion of ]{.calibre3}[phy­sei]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: what is phys­ical\] and ]{.calibre3}[the­sei]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: what is ar­ti­fi­cial\], that what ex­ists without the ad­di­tion of hu­man activ­ity, would be bet­ter than what is ar­ti­fi­cial. The tighter the net of what hu­man be­ings have made is drawn over the world, the more spas­mod­ic­ally do those who are do­ing the tight­en­ing, high­light their own prim­it­iv­ity and rooted­ness in nature. The dis­cov­ery of genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] as the last bul­wark of in­di­vidu­al­istic eth­ics \[]{.calibre3}[Ethik]{.calibre22}[\] is a re­flex of in­dus­trial mass pro­duc­tion. Only when count­less stand­ard­ized goods pre­tend, for the sake of profit, to be some­thing unique, does the idea crys­tal­lize -- as its an­ti­thesis, and yet ac­cord­ing to the same cri­teria -- that what is not to be re­pro­duced is what is au­then­tic­ally genu­ine. Pre­vi­ously, the ques­tion of genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] was no more ap­plied to in­tel­lec­tual en­tit­ies \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­bilde]{.calibre22}[\] than the ques­tion of ori­gin­al­ity, which was un­known even in the era of Bach. The de­cep­tion of genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] goes back to bour­geois de­lu­sion re­gard­ing the ex­change-pro­cess. What ap­pears genu­ine, is what com­mod­it­ies and other means of ex­change can be re­duced to -- above all, gold. The genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] ab­strac­ted like a pro­por­tion of a fine metal turns, like gold, into a fet­ish. Both are treated as it they were the sub­strate, which is nev­er­the­less in truth a so­cial re­la­tion­ship, while gold and genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] ex­press only the fun­gib­il­ity, the com­par­ab­il­ity of things: they are pre­cisely not in them­selves, but for oth­ers. The non-genu­ine­ness of the genu­ine rests on the fact that it must pre­tend, in the so­ci­ety ruled by ex­change, to be what it stands for, without ever be­ing truly able to be such. The apostles of genu­ine­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Ech­theit]{.calibre22}[\] of power, who dress down cir­cu­la­tion, per­form the dance of the money-veil at this lat­ter's wake.]{.calibre3}

[Sur l\'eau ]{.calibre22}[\[French: at sea\]. To the ques­tion of the goal of an eman­cip­ated so­ci­ety, one re­ceives an­swers such as the ful­fill­ment of hu­man pos­sib­il­it­ies or the rich­ness of life. As il­le­git­im­ate as the in­ev­it­able ques­tion may be, so in­ev­it­able is the re­puls­ive, out-trump­ing re­sponse, which re­calls to mind the so­cial demo­cratic per­son­al­ity-ideal of the heav­ily bearded nat­ur­al­ists of the 1890s, who wanted to live it up. Ten­der­ness would be solely what is most crude: that no-one should starve any longer. Any­thing else would ap­ply, to a con­di­tion which ought to be de­term­ined by hu­man needs, a hu­man be­ha­vior which is formed on the model of pro­duc­tion as its own pur­pose. The uto­pian im­age of the un­res­tric­ted, en­er­getic, cre­at­ive hu­man be­ing has been in­filt­rated by the com­mod­ity fet­ish­ism, which in bour­geois so­ci­ety brings with it in­hib­i­tion, power­less­ness, the ster­il­ity of mono­tony. The concept of dy­nam­ics, which com­ple­ments bour­geois "ahis­tor­icity," is raised to some­thing ab­so­lute, while it nev­er­the­less, as the an­thro­po­lo­gical re­flex of the laws of pro­duc­tion, must be crit­ic­ally con­fron­ted in the eman­cip­ated so­ci­ety with need. The idea of un­fettered do­ing, of un­in­ter­rup­ted cre­at­ing, of chubby-cheeked in­sa­ti­ab­il­ity, of free­dom as in­tense activ­ity, feeds on the bour­geois concept of nature, which from time im­me­morial has served to pro­claim so­cial vi­ol­ence as ir­re­voc­able, as a piece of healthy etern­ity. It was due to this and not any pre­sumed equal­iz­a­tion that the pos­it­ive designs of so­cial­ism, against which Marx bristled, re­mained in bar­bar­ism. What is to be feared is not the slack­en­ing of hu­man­ity in a life of lux­ury, but rather the des­s­ic­ated ex­pan­sion of what, in the guise of the all-nat­ural, is so­cial -- the col­lectiv­ity as the blind rage of mak­ing. The na­ively man­dated un­am­bi­gu­ity of the tend­ency of de­vel­op­ment to­wards the rais­ing of pro­duc­tion is it­self a piece of that bour­geois nature \[]{.calibre3}[Bür­ger­lich­keit]{.calibre22}[\], which per­mits de­vel­op­ment only in one dir­ec­tion, be­cause, in­teg­rated into the to­tal­ity, ruled by quan­ti­fic­a­tion, it is hos­tile to the qual­it­at­ive dif­fer­ence. If one thinks of the eman­cip­ated so­ci­ety as one eman­cip­ated pre­cisely from such a to­tal­ity, then align­ments be­come vis­ible, which have little in com­mon with the rais­ing of pro­duc­tion and its hu­man mir­ror-im­ages. If un­in­hib­ited people are by no means the most pleas­ant, and are not even the freest, then the so­ci­ety which freed it­self of its fet­ters, could ar­rive at the thought that even the pro­duct­ive forces are not the fi­nal sub­strate of hu­man be­ings, but are rather the his­tor­ic­ally spe­cific form of these last un­der com­mod­ity pro­duc­tion. Per­haps the true so­ci­ety would be­come bored with de­vel­op­ment, and would out of free­dom leave pos­sib­il­it­ies un­used, in­stead of storm­ing alien stars un­der a con­fused com­pul­sion. What would be­gin to dawn on a hu­man­ity, which no longer knew ur­gent ne­ces­sity \[Not: ne­ces­sity, priva­tion\], is just how de­lusory and fu­tile all the ar­range­ments hitherto cre­ated to es­cape priva­tion \[Not\] have been -- ar­range­ments which used wealth to re­pro­duce priva­tion \[Not\] on an ex­pan­ded scale. En­joy­ment it­self would be touched by this, just as its con­tem­por­ary schema can­not be sep­ar­ated from in­dus­tri­ous­ness, plan­ning, im­pos­ing one's will, sub­jug­a­tion. ]{.calibre3}[Rien faire comme une bête]{.calibre22}[ \[French: Do­ing noth­ing, like an an­imal\], ly­ing on the wa­ter and look peace­fully into the heav­ens, "be­ing, noth­ing else, without any fur­ther de­term­in­a­tion and ful­fill­ment" might step in place of pro­cess, do­ing, ful­filling, and so truly de­liver the prom­ise of dia­lect­ical lo­gic, of cul­min­at­ing in its ori­gin.

[Hot­house plant]{.calibre22}[. -- The talk of early or late de­vel­op­ment, sel­dom free of the death-wish for the former, is not bind­ing. Who­ever de­vel­ops early, lives in an­ti­cip­a­tion. Their ex­per­i­ence is an a pri­or­istic, in­tu­it­ive sens­ib­il­ity, which gropes in pic­tures and words for what is later re­deemed in things and hu­man be­ings. Such an­ti­cip­a­tion, sa­ti­ated in it­self, as it were, turns away from the ex­ternal world and lends the color of some­thing neur­ot­ic­ally play­ful to the re­la­tion­ship to the lat­ter. If early de­velopers are more than just the pos­sessors of skills, they are thus com­pelled to catch up, a com­pul­sion which nor­mal people are fond of dress­ing up as a moral com­mand­ment. One who de­vel­ops early must pain­fully con­quer the space of the re­la­tion to the ob­jects, which is en­com­passed by one's ideation \[]{.calibre3}[Vor­stel­lung]{.calibre22}[\]: they must even learn to suf­fer. The feel for the not-ego, which hardly ever both­ers sup­posed late de­velopers from within, be­comes an ur­gent ne­ces­sity for early de­velopers. The nar­ciss­istic dir­ec­tion of the drives, in­dic­ated by the pre­pon­der­ance of ima­gin­a­tion in its ex­per­i­ence, is pre­cisely what delays their de­vel­op­ment. They make their way ret­ro­spect­ively, with crass vi­ol­ence, through the situ­ations, fears, and pas­sions which were softened in their an­ti­cip­a­tion, and these lat­ter trans­form them­selves, in con­flict with the nar­ciss­ism of the former, into some­thing sickly and con­sum­ing. Thus early de­velopers fall prey to what is child­ish, which they once mastered all too slight ex­er­tion and which now de­mands its price; they be­come im­ma­ture and even silly, while the oth­ers, who were at every stage pre­cisely what they were ex­pec­ted to be, are ma­ture, and these now find un­par­don­able, what over­whelms formerly early de­velopers out­side of all pro­por­tion. Early de­velopers are stricken by pas­sion; sheltered all too long in the se­cur­ity of aut­arky, now they reel help­lessly, where they once built castles in the air. It is not for noth­ing that the hand­writ­ing of early de­velopers warns by its in­fant­ile traits. They are an em­bar­rass­ment to the nat­ural so­cial or­der, and ma­li­cious good health feeds on the danger which threatens them, just as so­ci­ety mis­trusts them as the vis­ible neg­a­tion of the equal­iz­a­tion of suc­cess and ex­er­tion. What is ful­filled in their in­tern­al­ized eco­nomy, is the un­con­scious yet im­plac­able pun­ish­ment which was al­ways in store for them. What was once proffered to them with il­lus­ory good will, is now can­celled out. Even in psy­cho­lo­gical des­tiny, an au­thor­ity watches over to en­sure that everything is paid for.

[Al­ways more slowly ahead. -- ]{.calibre22}[Run­ning on the street has the ex­pres­sion of ter­ror. The fall of the vic­tim is im­it­ated in the very at­tempt to es­cape the fall. The pos­ture of the head, which would like to re­mained raised, is that of someone who is drown­ing, the tense face re­sembles the grim­ace of tor­ture. They must look straight ahead, can­not even glance back, without stum­bling, as if the pur­suer \[]{.calibre3}[Ver­fol­ger]{.calibre22}[: fol­lower, per­se­cutor\] whose sight would cause them to freeze were breath­ing down their necks. Once one ran from dangers which were too des­per­ate to stand and face, and those who are run­ning after a bus speed­ing away still testify to this, without know­ing it. The flow of traffic no longer has to reckon with wild an­im­als, but at the same time it has not pa­ci­fied run­ning. This last es­tranges the bour­geois walk. The truth be­comes ap­par­ent, that some­thing is not right about se­cur­ity, that one must con­stantly evade the un­res­trained powers of life, even if these are only vehicles. The body's habit of walk­ing as some­thing nor­mal stems from the good old days. It was the bour­geois man­ner of get­ting some­where: phys­ical de­mytho­lo­giz­a­tion, free from the bane of the hier­atic step, the home­less fel­low­ship of the road, the breath­less flight. Hu­man dig­nity in­sisted on the right to the gait, a rhythm not drilled into the body by com­mand or ter­ror. Go­ing on prom­en­ades, be­ing a flan­eur were private ways of spend­ing time, the leg­acy of the feudal pleas­ure-jaunts of the 19th cen­tury. Walk­ing is dy­ing out along with the lib­eral epoch, even where autos are not be­ing driven. The youth move­ment, which groped for such tend­en­cies with un­mis­tak­able mas­ochism, chal­lenged the par­ental Sunday ex­cur­sion and re­placed it with the vol­un­tary march of power, which they christened with the me­di­eval name of trip \[]{.calibre3}[Fahrt]{.calibre22}[: jour­ney, travel\], while the Ford model quickly be­came avail­able to the lat­ter. Per­haps the cult of tech­nical speed­i­ness, just as in sports, con­ceals the im­pulse of mas­ter­ing the ter­ror of run­ning, by turn­ing it away from one's own body and at the same time high-handedly out­bid­ding it: the tri­umph of the in­creas­ing mile-marker ritu­ally at­tests to the fear of be­ing pur­sued. Whenever how­ever hu­man be­ings are told: "run," ran­ging from the chil­dren, who are sup­posed to fetch the mother a for­got­ten hand­bag from up­stairs, all the way to the pris­on­ers, who are com­manded by their es­corts to flee, in or­der to have a pre­text for mur­der­ing them, then the ar­chaic vi­ol­ence be­comes aud­ible, which oth­er­wise in­aud­ibly dir­ects every step.]{.calibre3}

[Boy from the heath]{.calibre22}[. -- What one most fears for no real reason, ap­par­ently ob­sessed by a fixed idea, has the un­nerv­ing habit of oc­cur­ring. The ques­tion which one would at no price like to hear, is asked by an as­sist­ant in a per­fi­di­ously friendly man­ner; the per­son, who one most wishes to keep dis­tant from one's be­loved, will end in­vit­ing the lat­ter, even if the former is three thou­sand miles away, thanks to a well-mean­ing re­com­mend­a­tion, lead­ing to pre­cisely the circle of ac­quaint­ances, from which the danger threatens. It is an open ques­tion as to what ex­tent one in­vites such ter­rors one­self; if one per­haps eli­cits that ques­tion from the ma­li­cious one by an all too eager si­lence; if one pro­vokes the fatal con­tact, by re­quest­ing the me­di­ator, out of a fool­ishly de­struct­ive trust, not to me­di­ate. Psy­cho­logy knows, that who­ever en­vi­sions the calam­ity, also some­how wishes for it. But why does the lat­ter seem to eager to meet them? Some­thing ap­peals, in the real­ity, to the para­noid fantasy which dis­torts such. The lat­ent sad­ism of all un­err­ingly guesses the lat­ent weak­ness of all. And the per­se­cu­tion fantasy is in­fec­tious: who­ever en­coun­ters it as a spec­tator is ir­res­ist­ibly driven to im­it­ate it. This suc­ceeds most eas­ily, when one gives it jus­ti­fi­able grounds, by do­ing what the other fears. "One fool makes many" -- the abyssal loneli­ness of de­lu­sion has a tend­ency to­wards col­lect­iv­iz­a­tion, which cites the pic­ture of de­lu­sion into life. This pathic mech­an­ism har­mon­izes with the so­cially de­term­in­ing one of today, wherein those who are so­cial­ized into des­per­ate isol­a­tion hun­ger for to­geth­er­ness and band to­gether in cold clumps. Thus folly be­comes epi­demic: vag­rant sects grow with the same rhythm as large or­gan­iz­a­tions. It is that of total de­struc­tion. The ful­fill­ment of per­se­cu­tion manias stems from its af­fin­ity to bloody be­ing \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[: nature, es­sence, char­ac­ter\]. Vi­ol­ence, on which civil­iz­a­tion is based, means the per­se­cu­tion of all by all, and those with per­se­cu­tion manias miss the boat solely, by dis­pla­cing what is wrought by the whole onto their neigh­bors, in the help­less at­tempt to make in­com­men­sur­ab­il­ity com­men­sur­able. They burn, be­cause they wish to im­me­di­ately grasp, with their bare hands, as it were, the ob­ject­ive il­lu­sion which they re­semble, while the ab­surdity con­sists pre­cisely of the per­fec­ted me­di­acy \[]{.calibre3}[Mit­tel­barkeit]{.calibre22}[\]. They fall as vic­tims to the per­petu­ation of the con­text of de­lu­sion. Even the worst and most sense­less con­cep­tion of events, the wild­est pro­jec­tions, con­tain the un­con­scious ef­fort of con­scious­ness, to re­cog­nize the fatal law, by vir­tue of which so­ci­ety per­petu­ates its life. The ab­er­ra­tion is ac­tu­ally only the short-cir­cuit of ad­apt­a­tion: the open fool­ish­ness of the one mis­takenly calls, in oth­ers, the fool­ish­ness of the whole by its cor­rect name, and the para­noid are the mock­ing im­age of the right life, by choos­ing on their own ini­ti­at­ive to make it sim­ilar to the wrong one. Just as sparks fly in a short-cir­cuit, so too does de­lu­sion com­mu­nic­ate with de­lu­sion truly like light­ning. Points of com­mu­nic­a­tion are the over­power­ing con­firm­a­tions of per­se­cu­tion manias, which mock the one who is ill for be­ing right, and thereby only push them in deeper. The sur­face of ex­ist­ence im­me­di­ately closes up again and proves to them, that things are not that bad and that they must be mad. They an­ti­cip­ate sub­ject­ively the con­di­tion, in which ob­ject­ive mad­ness and the power­less­ness of the in­di­vidual pass, un­me­di­ated, into each other, as in Fas­cism, where the dic­tat­or­ship of those who are per­se­cu­tion ma­ni­acs real­izes the fears of per­se­cu­tion of its vic­tims. The ques­tion of whether an ex­ag­ger­ated sus­pi­cion is para­noid or real­istic, the faint private echo of the tu­mult of his­tory, can thus be solely de­term­ined ret­ro­spect­ively. Psy­cho­logy does not reach into hor­ror.]{.calibre3}

[Golden Gate]{.calibre22}[ \[in Eng­lish\]. -- What dawns on those who are em­bar­rassed or spurned, il­lu­min­ates as harshly as the vi­ol­ent pain which wracks the body. They re­cog­nize, that in the in­ner­most core of de­luded love, which knows noth­ing of this and may know noth­ing, lives the de­mand of what is un­deluded. They have been wronged; they de­rive their claim of justice from this and must at the same time re­ject it, for what they wish, can only come out of free­dom. In such ur­gent ne­ces­sity, those who are re­jec­ted be­come hu­man be­ings. Just as love in­ali­en­ably be­trays the gen­er­al­ity to the par­tic­u­lar, by which alone the gen­er­al­ity is honored, so too does the gen­er­al­ity now turn fatally against love, as the autonomy of those who are nearest. Pre­cisely the re­jec­tion, by which the gen­er­al­ity as­serts it­self, ap­pears to the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] as be­ing ex­cluded from the gen­er­al­ity; who­ever loses love, feels deser­ted by all, which is why they des­pise con­sol­a­tion. In the sense­less­ness of the with­drawal they come to feel what is un­true of all merely in­di­vidual ful­fill­ment. Thereby how­ever they awaken to the para­dox­ical con­scious­ness of the gen­er­al­ity: of the in­ali­en­able and un­im­peach­able hu­man right, to be loved by the be­loved. With their pe­ti­tion, foun­ded on no title or claim, they ap­peal to an un­known court, which out of mercy ac­cords to them what be­longs to them and yet does not be­long to them. The secret of justice in love is the sub­la­tion of rights, to which love points with speech­less ges­tures.

[Only a quarter of an hour left]{.calibre22}[. -- Sleep­less night: there is a for­mula for this, ag­on­iz­ing hours, stretch­ing without pro­spect of end or dawn, in the vain ef­fort to for­get the empty dur­a­tion. Hor­ri­fy­ing, how­ever, are the sleep­less nights, in which time shrinks and runs fruit­lessly through one's fin­gers. One turns the light out in the hope for long hours of rest, which would as­sist one. But while one can­not still one's thoughts, the heal­ing nour­ish­ment of the night is squandered, and when one is fi­nally ready, to see no more un­der the burn­ing eye­lids, one knows that it is too late, that soon the ter­ri­fy­ing morn­ing will ar­rive. The fi­nal hours of those who are con­demned to death may elapse the same way, ir­res­ist­ibly, un­used. What how­ever is re­vealed by such a con­trac­tion of hours, is the coun­ter­point \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­gen­bild]{.calibre22}[\] of ful­filled time. If in the lat­ter the power of ex­per­i­ence breaks the bale­ful spell of dur­a­tion and gath­ers what is past and what is fu­ture into the present, then dur­a­tion cre­ates un­bear­able hor­ror in the hur­ried, sleep­less night. Hu­man life be­comes a mo­ment, not by sub­lat­ing dur­a­tion, but by de­cay­ing to noth­ing, awaken­ing to its fu­til­ity in face of the bad in­fin­ity of time it­self. In the overly loud ticks of the clock, one per­ceives the mock­ery of the eons for the span of one's own ex­ist­ence. The hours, which are already past like seconds, be­fore the in­ner senses have grasped them, and sweep the lat­ter away in their fall, re­gister, how one in­clud­ing all of memory is or­dained to for­get­ting in the cos­mic night. Hu­man be­ings are made com­pulsor­ily aware of this today. In the con­di­tion of com­plete power­less­ness, what life-span re­mains to the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] ap­pears as little more than a brief re­prieve from the gal­lows. One no longer ex­pects to live out one's life to the end. The pro­spect of vi­ol­ent death and mar­tyr­dom, present to every­one, per­petu­ates it­self in the fear that the days are numbered, that the length of one's own life stands un­der the sway of stat­ist­ics; that be­com­ing old has be­come an un­spoken ad­vant­age, as it were, de­rived by beat­ing the av­er­ages. Per­haps the life-quota provided for by so­ci­ety, re­voc­able at any time, has been used up. The body re­gisters such fear in the flight of hours. Time flies.]{.calibre3}

[All the little flowers]{.calibre22}[. -- The sen­tence, most likely from Jean-Paul, that memor­ies are the only prop­erty which can­not be taken from us, be­longs in the store­house of a power­lessly sen­ti­mental con­sol­a­tion, which would like to think that the self-re­noun­cing with­drawal of the sub­ject into in­ter­i­or­ity is pre­cisely the ful­fill­ment, from which the con­sol­a­tion turns away. By es­tab­lish­ing the archive of one­self, the sub­ject com­mand­eers its own stock of ex­per­i­ence as prop­erty and thereby turns it once more into some­thing en­tirely ex­ternal to the sub­ject. The past in­ner life turns into fur­niture, just as, con­versely, every piece of Bie­der­meier fur­niture was memory made wood. The ]{.calibre3}[in­térieur]{.calibre22}[ \[French: in­terior\], in which the soul stores its col­lec­tion of curi­os­it­ies and mem­or­ab­ilia, is in­valid. Memor­ies can­not be pre­served in draw­ers and file cab­in­ets, but rather in them is in­dis­sol­ubly in­ter­woven what is past with what is present. No-one has them at their dis­posal in the free­dom and ar­bit­rar­i­ness, whose praise re­sounds in the swollen sen­tences of Jean-Paul. Pre­cisely where they be­comes con­trol­lable and ob­ject­ive, where the sub­ject thinks of them as wholly se­cure, memor­ies fade like soft wall-pa­pers un­der harsh sun­light. Where how­ever they re­tain their en­ergy, pro­tec­ted by what is for­got­ten, they are en­dangered like any­thing which is alive. The con­cep­tion of Bergson and Proust, aimed against re­ific­a­tion, ac­cord­ing to which what is con­tem­por­ary, what is im­me­di­acy, con­sti­tutes it­self only through memory, the re­ci­pro­city of what is now and what is then, has for that reason not merely a provid­en­tial but also an in­fernal as­pect. Just as no earlier ex­per­i­ence truly ex­ists, which was not de­tached from the rigor mor­tis of its isol­ated ex­ist­ence by in­vol­un­tary me­mori­al­iz­a­tion, so too is the con­verse true, that no memory is guar­an­teed, as ex­ist­ing in it­self, in­dif­fer­ent to­wards the fu­ture of the one who har­bors it; noth­ing which is past is safe from the curse of the em­pir­ical present, through the trans­ition into mere rep­res­ent­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Vor­stel­lung]{.calibre22}[\]. The most bliss­ful memory of a hu­man be­ing can, ac­cord­ing to its sub­stance, be re­pealed by a later ex­per­i­ence. Who­ever loved and be­trayed love, does some­thing aw­ful not only to the pic­ture of what has been, but to this last it­self. With in­con­tro­vert­ible evid­ence, an un­will­ing ges­ture while awaken­ing, a hol­low ca­dence, a faint hy­po­crisy of pleas­ure, in­veigles it­self into the memory, mak­ing the near­ness of yes­ter­day already into the ali­en­a­tion, which it today has be­come. Des­pair has the ex­pres­sion of what is ir­re­voc­able not be­cause things couldn't go bet­ter next time, but be­cause it draws the pre­vi­ous time into its maw. That is why it is fool­ish and sen­ti­mental, to wish to pre­serve what is past as pure in the midst of the dirty flood of what is con­tem­por­ary. This lat­ter, de­livered un­pro­tec­ted to calam­ity, is left with no other hope than to emerge once more from this lat­ter as some­thing else. To those how­ever who die in des­pair, their whole life was in vain. ]{.calibre3}

[Ne cher­chez plus mon coeur]{.calibre22}[. \[French: Don't search for my heart, line from Baudelaire's poem ]{.calibre3}[Caus­erie]{.calibre22}[\]. -- The heir of Balzac's ob­ses­sion, Proust, to who every mundane in­vit­a­tion seemed to be the "open ses­ame" of the re­con­sti­t­uted life, leads into the labyrinths, where pre­his­toric gos­sip con­veys to him the shad­owy secrets of everything which gleams, un­til this lat­ter be­comes ob­tuse and cracked un­der the all too near and long­ing eyes. But the ]{.calibre3}[placet fu­tile]{.calibre22}[ \[French: use­less pe­ti­tion\], the con­cerns of a his­tor­ic­ally con­demned lux­ury class, which every bour­geois could cal­cu­late as su­per­flu­ous, the ab­surd en­ergy, which is wasted on the wasters, finds it­self more thor­oughly re­war­ded than the im­par­tial gaze for what is rel­ev­ant. The schema of dis­as­sembly \[]{.calibre3}[Zer­falls]{.calibre22}[: dis­in­teg­ra­tion, dis­in­cor­por­a­tion\], ac­cord­ing to which Proust cites the pic­ture of his "so­ci­ety" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], proves to be one of the great so­cial tend­en­cies of de­vel­op­ment. What goes to pieces in Charlus, Saint-Loup and Swann, is the same thing, which the en­tire gen­er­a­tion born af­ter­wards lacked, who no longer even knew the name of the latest poet. The ec­cent­ric psy­cho­logy of ]{.calibre3}[décadence]{.calibre22}[ \[French: dec­ad­ence\] out­lines the neg­at­ive an­thro­po­logy of mass so­ci­ety: Proust gives an al­ler­gic ac­count­ing of what was later done to all love. The ex­change re­la­tion­ship, which this last par­tially con­tra­dicted dur­ing the bour­geois epoch, has en­tirely ab­sorbed it; the last im­me­di­acy falls vic­tim to the dis­tance of all ad­versar­ies to all oth­ers. Love freezes from the value, which the ego ascribes to it­self. Its love ap­pears to it as a lov­ing more, and who­ever loves more, does wrong. They in­cur the sus­pi­cions of the be­loved, and are thrown back on them­selves, fall­ing ill due to their in­clin­a­tion to pos­sess­ive cruelty and self-de­struct­ive ima­gin­a­tion. "The re­la­tion to the be­loved," goes a pas­sage in ]{.calibre3}[Temps ret­rouvé]{.calibre22}[ \[French: time re­covered, mul­tivolume work by Proust\], "may re­main pla­tonic out of en­tirely dif­fer­ent reas­ons than the chastity of the wo­man and also not for the sake of the sen­sual char­ac­ter of love, which she in­spires. Per­haps the lover is in­cap­able, in the bound­less­ness of his love, of wait­ing for the mo­ment of ful­fill­ment with ad­equate dis­sim­u­la­tion or in­dif­fer­ence. He meets her in­cess­antly, does not cease to write to her, at­tempts to visit her; she re­fuses, and he des­pairs. From this mo­ment on she un­der­stands that if she only grants him her com­pany or friend­ship, such a fa­vor will ap­pear, to someone who had already given up all hope, so great that she can spare her­self the trouble of giv­ing him any more con­ces­sions, so that she can se­curely wait, un­til he finds him­self pre­pared, be­cause he is in­cap­able of go­ing without see­ing her any longer, to end the war at any price: then she can dic­tate the terms of the peace, whose first con­di­tion is the pla­tonic nature of the re­la­tion­ship\... All this the wo­man guesses in­stinct­ively and knows that she can af­ford the lux­ury of never giv­ing her­self to the man whose un­quench­able de­sire she feels, if he is too well-bred to hide it from her from the very be­gin­ning." The young male pros­ti­tute Mo­rel is stronger than his high-fly­ing lover. "He al­ways re­tained the up­per hand, by only re­fus­ing him­self, and in or­der to re­fuse him­self, it prob­ably suf­ficed for him to know he was loved." The private motive of Balzac's Duch­ess Langeais has spread uni­ver­sally. The qual­ity of each one of the in­nu­mer­able autos, which turn every Sunday even­ing back to New York, cor­res­ponds ex­actly to the pret­ti­ness of the girl sit­ting in­side. -- The ob­ject­ive dis­sol­u­tion of so­ci­ety mani­fests it­self sub­ject­ively, by the fact that the erotic drive has be­come too weak, to bind self-pre­serving mon­ads, as if hu­man­ity were im­it­at­ing the phys­ics the­ory of the ex­plod­ing cos­mos. The fri­gid un­at­tain­ab­il­ity of the be­loved's nature \[]{.calibre3}[We­sens]{.calibre22}[\], mean­while an ac­know­ledged in­sti­tu­tion of the mass-cul­ture, is answered by the "un­quench­able de­sire" of the lover. When Cas­anova named a wo­man un­pre­ju­diced, he meant that no re­li­gious con­ven­tion hindered her from giv­ing her­self; today the un­pre­ju­diced wo­man is one who no longer be­lieves in love, who doesn't let her­self be taken for a ride, by in­vest­ing any more than she can ex­pect back. Sexu­al­ity, for whose sake nev­er­the­less the whole fuss is pre­sum­ably about, has turned into the de­lu­sion, which con­sisted earlier in re­nun­ci­ation. By leav­ing no time any­more in the ar­range­ments of life for a pleas­ure con­scious of it­self, and re­pla­cing it with physiolo­gical ex­er­cises, un­in­hib­ited sexu­al­ity is it­self de­sexu­al­ized. Ac­tu­ally they no longer want the eu­phoria any­more, but merely the com­pens­a­tion, which stands for the ef­fort, which they would like most of all to spare them­selves as su­per­flu­ous.]{.calibre3}

[Prin­cess Liz­ard.]{.calibre22}[ -- The ima­gin­a­tion is in­flamed pre­cisely by the wo­men whose ima­gin­a­tion has worn away. Those who glow with the most col­or­ful nim­bus, turned un­re­mit­tingly to the out­side, are en­tirely sober. Their at­trac­tion stems from their lack of con­scious­ness of them­selves, in­deed the lack of a self at all: Oscar Wilde in­ven­ted the name of the un­en­ig­matic sphinx for them. They re­semble their des­ig­nated pic­tures: the purer their ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] is, un­dis­turbed by any sort of im­pulse, the more sim­ilar they are to ar­che­types, Preziosa, Per­eg­rina, Al­b­ertine, who hint that all in­di­vidu­ation is pre­cisely mere ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] and who nev­er­the­less must al­ways dis­ap­point again through that, which they are. Their life is un­der­stood as am il­lus­tra­tion or an ever­last­ing chil­dren's fest­ival, and such per­cep­tion does in­justice to their needy em­pir­ical ex­ist­ence. Storm has dealt with this in the deeply sym­bolic chil­dren's story "Pole Pop­pen­spaeler." The Friesian boy falls in love with the little girl, who is trav­el­ing with a group from Bav­aria. "When I fi­nally turned around, I saw a red dress ap­pear be­fore me; and truly, and truly, it was the little pup­pet-player; in spite of her tattered cloth­ing she seemed to me to be sur­roun­ded by a fairy-tale glow. I gathered up cour­age and spoke to her: 'Would you like to take a walk, Lisa?' She looked at me mis­trust­fully with her black eyes. 'Take a walk?' she re­peated at length. 'Ah, you -- you\'re the limit!' 'Where do you want to go?' -- 'I wanna to go to the draper's shop!' 'You want to buy a new dress?' I asked fool­ishly enough. She laughed out loud. 'Get out of here! -- No, only a little rag!' 'Little rag, Lisa?' -- 'Sure thing! Just some scraps to dress up the doll; costs only a little bit!' Poverty forces Lisa to limit her­self to what is shabby -- "rags" -- al­though she her­self would be happy if things were oth­er­wise. Mis­un­der­stand­ing, she must mis­trust everything as ex­ag­ger­ated, which is not prac­tic­ally jus­ti­fied. Ima­gin­a­tion steps too close to poverty. For what is shabby has ma­gic only for the ob­server. And nev­er­the­less ima­gin­a­tion needs poverty, to which it does vi­ol­ence: the hap­pi­ness, which it clings to, is in­scribed with the traits of suf­fer­ing. Thus Sade names Justine, who falls into one trap of tor­ture after an­other, ]{.calibre3}[notre in­téress­ante héroine]{.calibre22}[ \[French: our in­ter­est­ing heroine\], and even Mignon, in the mo­ment in which she is beaten, the in­ter­est­ing child. The dream prin­cess and the whip­ping-girl are the same, and they sus­pect noth­ing of this. Traces of this are still evid­ent in the re­la­tion­ship of the north­ern peoples to the south­ern: the well-heeled pur­itan seeks in vain from the bru­nette from for­eign lands, what the course of the world, which the former com­mands, severs not merely from them­selves but above all from the vag­rants. Those who are rooted envy the nomads, the search for fresh pas­tures, and the green wagon is the house on wheels, whose path is ac­com­pan­ied by stars. In­fant­il­ity, en­sorceled in un­planned move­ment, the un­hap­pily in­con­stant, mo­ment­ary pres­sure to con­tinue to live, stands for some­thing un­dis­tor­ted, for ful­fill­ment, and yet nev­er­the­less ex­cludes it, sim­ilar to the in­ner­most core of self-pre­ser­va­tion, from which it pre­tends to re­deem it­self from. That is the circle of bour­geois long­ing for what is na­ive. What is soul­less in those who, at the bor­ders of cul­ture, are daily for­bid­den self-de­term­in­a­tion, charm and tor­ture at the same time, turns into a phant­asmagoria of the soul for the well-heeled, who have learned from cul­ture, to be ashamed of the soul. Love loses it­self in what is soul­less as in the cipher of what has soul, be­cause the liv­ing are the arena of the des­per­ate de­sire for sal­va­tion, which has its ob­ject only in what is lost: love arises in the soul first in its ab­sence. It is pre­cisely the ex­pres­sion of the eyes, which is closest to those of an an­imal -- the creaturely ex­pres­sion -- which is hu­man, dis­tant from the re­flec­tion of the ego. In the end the soul is it­self the long­ing of the soul­less for sal­va­tion.]{.calibre3}

[L\'inutile beauté.]{.calibre22}[ \[French: use­less beauty\]. -- Wo­men of es­pe­cial beauty are con­demned to un­hap­pi­ness. Even those to have all the ad­vant­ages, who have birth, wealth, and tal­ent on their side, seem as if pur­sued or ob­sessed with the pres­sure to des­troy of them­selves and all hu­man re­la­tion­ships, in which they enter. An or­acle puts be­fore them the choice of dooms. Either they clev­erly ex­change beauty for suc­cess. Then they pay with hap­pi­ness for its con­di­tion; since they can no longer love, they poison love to oth­ers and re­main empty-handed. Or the priv­ilege of beauty gives them the cour­age and se­cur­ity, to defy the ex­change-con­tract. They take the hap­pi­ness ser­i­ously, which is prom­ised in them, and do not limit them­selves, thus con­firmed by the at­trac­tion of all, that do not at first have to prove their worth. In their youth they have the choice. This makes them in­dis­crim­in­ate: noth­ing is defin­it­ive, everything can be re­placed. Quite early, without much con­sid­er­a­tion, they marry and ded­ic­ate them­selves to ped­es­trian con­di­tions, re­lin­quish­ing \[]{.calibre3}[en­täussern]{.calibre22}[: to re­lin­quish, dis­close, real­ize\] to a cer­tain ex­tent the priv­ilege of in­fin­ite pos­sib­il­ity, de­grad­ing them­selves to hu­man be­ings. At the same time how­ever they hold fast to their child­hood dream of he­ge­mony, which their life flashes be­fore them, and do not cease -- therein un­bour­geois -- to throw away what, to­mor­row, could be some­thing bet­ter. That is their type of de­struct­ive char­ac­ter. Pre­cisely be­cause they were once ]{.calibre3}[hors de con­cours]{.calibre22}[ \[French: out­side of the com­pet­i­tion\], they are rendered sub­al­terns in the com­pet­i­tion, which they now manically pur­sue. Solely the ges­ture of ir­res­ist­ib­il­ity re­mains, while the lat­ter already dis­in­teg­rates \[]{.calibre3}[zer­fällt]{.calibre22}[\]; ma­gic dis­in­teg­rates \[]{.calibre3}[zer­fällt]{.calibre22}[\], as soon as ex­presses it­self as do­mest­ic­ated, in­stead of por­tray­ing it­self as hope. She who res­ists how­ever is sim­ul­tan­eously the sac­ri­fice: she ends up un­der the so­cial or­der, which she once flew over. Her gen­er­os­ity is given pun­ish­ment. The fallen wo­man as well as the ob­sess­ive one are mar­tyrs of hap­pi­ness. In­cor­por­ated beauty has in the mean­while turned into a cal­cul­able ele­ment of ex­ist­ence, a mere re­place­ment for the non-ex­ist­ing life, without reach­ing bey­ond the lat­ter in the slight­est. She has broken her prom­ise of hap­pi­ness to her­self and oth­ers. She how­ever, who stands for this hap­pi­ness, takes on the aura of calam­ity and is her­self over­taken by calam­ity. Therein the en­lightened world has com­pletely and ut­terly ab­sorbed mythos. The envy of the gods has out­lived them.]{.calibre3}

[Con­stance. -- ]{.calibre22}[Every­where bour­geois so­ci­ety in­sists on the ex­er­tion of the will; only love is sup­posed to be in­vol­un­tary, the pure im­me­di­acy of the feel­ings. In the long­ing for this, which means the dis­pens­a­tion from labor, the bour­geois idea of love tran­scends bour­geois so­ci­ety. How­ever by un­me­di­atedly put­ting up what is true as what is uni­ver­sally un­true, it in­verts the former into the lat­ter. It is not merely that pure feel­ings, as far as they are still pos­sible in the eco­nom­ic­ally de­term­ined sys­tem, so­cially turn thereby into the alibi for the dom­in­a­tion of in­terest and test­i­fies to a hu­man­ity, which does not ex­ist. But rather the in­vol­un­tar­i­ness of love it­self, even where it is not ar­ranged quite prac­tic­ally in ad­vance, con­trib­utes to that whole, as soon as it es­tab­lishes it­self as a prin­ciple. If love is sup­posed to por­tray in so­ci­ety a bet­ter one, then it is cap­able of do­ing so not as a peace­ful en­clave, but only in con­scious res­ist­ance. That how­ever re­quires just that mo­ment of caprice, which the bour­geois, to who love can never be nat­ural enough, for­bids it. Love means the ca­pa­city to not al­low im­me­di­acy to wither from the ubi­quit­ous pres­sure of me­di­ation, of the eco­nomy, and in such fi­del­ity it is me­di­ated in it­self, as ten­a­cious counter-pres­sure. Those who love are only those who have the en­ergy to hold fast to love. If so­cial ad­vant­age, sub­lim­ated, still pre­forms the sexual drive-im­pulse, causes, through a thou­sand shad­ings of what is con­firmed by the so­cial or­der, now this per­son and now that one to ap­pear spon­tan­eously at­tract­ive, then the at­trac­tion which has once taken root con­tra­dicts this, by per­sist­ing where the grav­ity of so­ci­ety, above all in the in­trigue which is reg­u­larly taken into so­ci­ety's ser­vice, does not wish it to be. The test of the feel­ings is whether they en­dure bey­ond the feel­ing through dur­a­tion, even if it were only ob­ses­sion. The kind which, un­der the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of un­re­flect­ive spon­taneity and proud of its pre­sumed up­right­ness, rely com­pletely and ut­terly on what it con­siders to be the voice of the heart, and runs away, as soon as it no longer thinks it per­ceives those voices, is in such sov­er­eign in­de­pend­ence pre­cisely the tool of so­ci­ety. Pass­ively, without know­ing it, it re­gisters the num­bers, which roll out of the roul­ette wheel of their in­terests. By be­tray­ing the be­loved, it be­trays it­self. The com­mand of fi­del­ity, which so­ci­ety le­gis­lates, is the means of un­free­dom, but only through fi­del­ity does free­dom real­ize its in­sub­or­din­a­tion against the com­mand of so­ci­ety. ]{.calibre3}

[Philemon and Baucis. ]{.calibre22}[\[Greek myth­o­logy:\] -- The house­hold tyr­ant has his wife help him into his coat. She eagerly does the ser­vice of love and ac­com­pan­ies him with a glance, which says: what am I sup­posed to do, let him have his little joys, that's the way he is, only a man. Pat­ri­archal mar­riage re­venges it­self on the man through the in­dul­gence, which the wo­man prac­tices and which has turned into a for­mula in the ironic lament of male vul­ner­ab­il­ity and de­pend­ence. In­side of the ly­ing ideo­logy, which pos­its the man as su­per­ior, lies a secret, not less un­true one, which re­duces him to some­thing in­ferior, to the vic­tim of ma­nip­u­la­tion, man­euvers, de­cep­tion. The hen-pecked hus­band is the shadow of the one who must ven­ture out into hos­tile life. Chil­dren size up adults with the same nar­row-minded per­spica­city as the wife ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ the hus­band. In the dis­pro­por­tion between his au­thor­it­arian claim and his help­less­ness, which ne­ces­sar­ily comes to light in the private sphere, some­thing ri­dicu­lous is con­cealed. Every mar­ried couple ap­pear­ing to­gether is comic, and this is what the pa­tient un­der­stand­ing of the wife at­tempts to bal­ance out. There is scarcely any long-mar­ried wo­man, who does not dis­avow their spouse by whis­per­ing about small weak­nesses. False near­ness stim­u­lates malice, and in the realm of con­sump­tion, those who have their hands on things are stronger. Hegel's dia­lectic of mas­ter and slave is as valid then as now in the ar­chaic so­cial or­der of the house and is strengthened, be­cause the wife ten­a­ciously holds fast to the ana­chron­ism. As sup­pressed mat­ri­arch she be­comes the mas­ter there, where she must serve, and the pat­ri­arch need only ap­pear as such, in or­der to be­come a ca­ri­ca­ture. Such a sim­ul­tan­eous dia­lectic of the epoch has presen­ted it­self to the in­di­vidu­al­istic gaze as the "battle of the sexes." Both op­pon­ents are wrong. In the dis­en­chant­ment of the man, whose power rests on the earn­ing of money which pre­tends to be hu­man rank, the wo­man ex­presses at the same time the un­truth of the mar­riage, in which she seeks her en­tire truth. No eman­cip­a­tion without that of so­ci­ety.]{.calibre3}

[Et dona fer­entes. ]{.calibre22}[\[Latin: frag­ment of "Timeo Danaos et dona fer­entes," "I fear the Greeks though bear­ing gifts.\"\] -- The Ger­man phil­istines of free­dom have al­ways put great store in the \[Goethean\] poem of ]{.calibre3}[God and the Bay­adere]{.calibre22}[ \[bay­adere: Hindu temple dan­cing-girl\], with the clos­ing fan­fare that im­mor­tals raise lost chil­dren in their fiery arms to heaven. The ap­proved warm-hearted­ness is not to be trus­ted. It thor­oughly ap­pro­pri­ates the bour­geois judg­ment on bought love; it at­tains the ef­fect of all-fath­erly un­der­stand­ing and for­give­ness only by im­pugn­ing the lovely one to be saved with shud­der­ing de­light as someone who is lost. The act of mercy is bound up with re­ser­va­tions, which make it il­lus­ory. In or­der to earn re­demp­tion -- as if an earned re­demp­tion could be any­thing of the sort -- the girl may her­self par­ti­cip­ate in the "bed's pleas­ant fest­ival," "neither for pleas­ure nor gain." Well, then why else? Doesn't the pure love ex­pec­ted of her clum­sily touch the ma­gic, which Goethe's dance-rhythm winds around her fig­ure and which then in­deed is no longer to be can­celled out by the talk of deep per­di­tion? But she is sup­posed to be­come the sort of good soul through­out, who for­gets her­self only once. In or­der to be ad­mit­ted to the en­clos­ure of hu­man­ity, the para­mour, whose tol­er­a­tion hu­man­ity brags about, must first cease to be one. The deity of pen­it­ent sin­ners re­joices \[quo­ta­tion from Goethe's poem\]. The en­tire ex­ped­i­tion to where the last houses are, is a kind of meta­phys­ical "slum­ming party" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], an event of pat­ri­archal mean­ness, in­flat­ing it­self twice over, by first rais­ing the dis­tance between the male Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] and fe­male nature into some­thing im­meas­ur­able and then drap­ing the su­preme power, which takes back even its self-cre­ated dis­tinc­tion, as the highest be­ne­vol­ence. The bour­geoisie needs the bay­adere, not merely for the sake of pleas­ure, which they sim­ul­tan­eously be­grudge her for, but in or­der to feel like a god. The closer they ap­proach the edge of their realm and for­get their dig­nity, the crasser the ritual of vi­ol­ence. The night has its pleas­ure, but the whore is nev­er­the­less burnt. The rest is the idea.]{.calibre3}

[Spoilsport]{.calibre22}[. -- The af­fin­ity between as­ceti­cism and eu­phoria, noted by the hum­drum wis­dom of psy­cho­logy, the love-hate between saints and whores, has the ob­ject­ively valid ground, that as­ceti­cism ac­cords to ful­fill­ment more of its rights than cul­tural in­stall­ment-pay­ments. The hos­til­ity to pleas­ure is cer­tainly not to be sep­ar­ated from the con­sensus with the dis­cip­line of a so­ci­ety, which has its es­sence \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\] in de­mand­ing more than it grants in re­turn. But there is also a mis­trust against pleas­ure which comes from the in­tu­ition, that the lat­ter is in this world noth­ing of the sort. A con­struc­tion of Schopen­hauer un­con­sciously ex­pressed some­thing of this in­tu­ition. The trans­ition from the af­firm­a­tion to the re­pu­di­ation of the will to life oc­curs in the de­vel­op­ment of the thought, that in every de­lim­it­a­tion of the will by a bar­rier "which is placed\... between it and its former goal" there is suf­fer­ing; in con­trast, "its at­tain­ment of the goal" would be "sat­is­fac­tion, well-be­ing, hap­pi­ness." While such "suf­fer­ing," ac­cord­ing to Schopen­hauer's in­transigent cog­ni­tion, could eas­ily enough grow to the point that death it­self would be prefer­able, the con­di­tion of "sat­is­fac­tion" is it­self un­sat­is­fy­ing, be­cause "as soon as a shel­ter is gran­ted to hu­man be­ings from ur­gent ne­ces­sity and suf­fer­ing, bore­dom is so close at hand, that it re­quires the killing of time. What oc­cu­pies all liv­ing be­ings and keeps them in mo­tion, is the striv­ing for ex­ist­ence \[]{.calibre3}[Da­sein]{.calibre22}[\]. They don't know what to do with ex­ist­ence, how­ever, what it is as­sured: thus the second thing, which they set into mo­tion, is the striv­ing to be free of the bur­den of ex­ist­ence, to make it im­per­cept­ible, 'to kill time', that is, to es­cape bore­dom." (Schopen­hauer, Col­lec­ted Works, Grand Duke Wil­helm-Ernst Edi­tion, Volume I: The World as Will and Idea. I. In­tro­duc­tion by Eduard Grise­bach. Leipzig 1920, pg 415). But the concept of this bore­dom which is sub­lated to such un­sus­pec­ted dig­nity, is some­thing which Schopen­hauer's sens­ib­il­ity, which is hos­tile to his­tory, would least like to ad­mit -- bour­geois through and through. It is, as the ex­per­i­ence of an­ti­thet­ical "free time," the com­ple­ment of ali­en­ated labor, whether this free time is sup­posed to merely re­pro­duce ex­pen­ded en­ergy, or whether it is burdened by the ex­trac­tion of alien labor as a mort­gage. Free time re­mains the re­flex of the rhythm of pro­duc­tion as some­thing im­posed het­ero­nom­ously, to which the former is com­pulsor­ily held fast even in peri­ods of wear­i­ness. The con­scious­ness of the un­free­dom of all ex­ist­ence, which the pres­sure of the de­mands of com­merce, and thus un­free­dom it­self, does not al­low to ap­pear, emerges first in the in­ter­mezzo of free­dom. The ]{.calibre3}[nos­tal­gie du di­manche]{.calibre22}[ \[French: Sunday nos­tal­gia\] is not home­sick­ness for the work­week, but for the con­di­tion which is eman­cip­ated from this; Sundays are un­sat­is­fy­ing, not be­cause they are ob­served, but be­cause its own prom­ise im­me­di­ately rep­res­ents it­self at the same time as some­thing un­ful­filled; like the Eng­lish one, every Sunday is too little Sunday. Those for who time pain­fully ex­tends it­self, who wait in vain, are dis­ap­poin­ted that it failed to hap­pen, that to­mor­row goes past once more just like yes­ter­day. The bore­dom of those how­ever who do not need to work, is not fun­da­ment­ally dif­fer­ent from this. So­ci­ety as a to­tal­ity im­poses, on those with ad­min­is­trat­ive power, what they do to oth­ers, and what these lat­ter may not do, the former will scarcely per­mit them­selves. The bour­geoisie have turned sati­ety, which ought to be the close re­la­tion of ec­stasy, into an epi­thet. Be­cause oth­ers go hungry, ideo­logy de­mands that the ab­sence of hun­ger should count as vul­gar. Thus the bour­geoisie in­dict the bour­geoisie. Their own ex­ist­ence, as ex­empt from labor, pre­vents any praise of lazi­ness: the lat­ter would be bor­ing. The hec­tic bustle, which Schopen­hauer refers to, is due less to the un­bear­able nature of the priv­ileged con­di­tion than to its os­ten­ta­tion, which ac­cord­ing to the his­tor­ical situ­ation either en­larges the so­cial dis­tance or seem­ingly re­duces such through pre­sum­ably im­port­ant events and ce­re­mon­ies, which are sup­posed to em­phas­ize the use­ful­ness of the mas­ters. If those at the top truly felt bored, this stems not from too much hap­pi­ness, but from the fact that they are marked by the gen­eral un­hap­pi­ness; by the com­mod­ity char­ac­ter, which con­signs the pleas­ures to idiocy, by the bru­tal­ity of com­mand, whose ter­ri­fy­ing echo re­sounds in the high spir­its of the rulers, fi­nally by their fear of their own su­per­flu­ous­ness. Noone who profits from the profit-sys­tem is cap­able of ex­ist­ing therein without shame, and it dis­torts even un­dis­tor­ted pleas­ure, al­though the ex­cesses, which the philo­soph­ers envy, may by no means be so bor­ing as they as­sure us. That bore­dom would dis­ap­pear in real­ized free­dom, is some­thing vouch­safed by many ex­per­i­ences stolen from civil­iz­a­tion. The say­ing ]{.calibre3}[omne an­imal post co­itum triste]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: all an­im­als are sad after mat­ing\] was de­vised by bour­geois con­tempt for hu­man­ity: nowhere more than here does what is hu­man dis­tin­guish it­self from creaturely sor­row. Not eu­phoria but so­cially ap­proved love eli­cits dis­gust: the lat­ter is, in Ib­sen's word, sticky. Those who are deeply moved by erotic sen­ti­ment trans­form fa­tigue into the plea for ten­der­ness, and mo­ment­ary sexual in­ca­pa­city is un­der­stood as ac­ci­dental, en­tirely ex­ternal to pas­sion. It is not for noth­ing that Baudelaire thought the bond­age of erotic ob­ses­sion to­gether with the il­lu­min­at­ing spir­itu­al­iz­a­tion, nam­ing kiss, scent and con­ver­sa­tion equally im­mor­tal. The tran­si­ence of pleas­ure, on which as­ceti­cism stakes its claim, stands for the fact that ex­cept in the minutes heureuses \[French: happy minutes\], in which the for­got­ten life of the lover ra­di­ates from the arms and limbs of the be­loved, there is no pleas­ure yet at all. Even the Chris­tian de­nun­ci­ation of sex in Tol­stoy's ]{.calibre3}[Kreutzer Son­ata]{.calibre22}[ can­not en­tirely can­cel out the memory of this in the middle of all the Capu­cin-style preach­ing. What he re­proaches sen­su­ous love for, is not only the gran­di­osely over­ween­ing theo­lo­gical mo­tif of self-denial, that no hu­man be­ing may turn an­other into an ob­ject -- ac­tu­ally thus a protest against pat­ri­archal con­trol -- but at the same time the me­mori­al­iz­a­tion of the bour­geois mal­form­a­tion of sex, in its murky en­tan­gle­ment with every ma­ter­ial in­terest, in mar­riage as a hu­mi­li­at­ing com­prom­ise, how­ever much of an un­der­cur­rent of Rousseau's re­sent­ment against pleas­ure raised to re­flec­tion runs in this. The at­tack on the period of the en­gage­ment is aimed at the fam­ily pho­to­graph, which re­semb­lance the word "bride­groom." 'And moreover there was that ri­dicu­lous cus­tom of giv­ing sweets, of coarse gor­mand­iz­ing on sweets, and all those ab­om­in­able pre­par­a­tions for the wed­ding: re­marks about the house, the bed­room, beds, wraps, dress­ing-gowns, un­der­cloth­ing, cos­tumes.' \[]{.calibre3}[The Kreutzer Son­ata]{.calibre22}[, trans. R. Gust­afson, Ox­ford UP: 1997, pg 107\] He sim­il­arly mocks the hon­ey­moon, which is com­pared to the dis­ap­point­ment after vis­it­ing an 'ex­tremely un­in­ter­est­ing' fair­ground booth, ex­tolled by a hawker. The ex­hausted senses are less to blame for this ]{.calibre3}[dégoût]{.calibre22}[ \[French: dis­gust\] than what is in­sti­tu­tion­al­ized, or­dained, pre­fab­ric­ated in pleas­ure, its false im­man­ence in the so­cial or­der which ad­justs it and turns it into some­thing deathly sad, in the mo­ment it is de­creed. Such con­trar­i­ness may grow to the point that all eu­phoria ul­ti­mately prefers to cease, in­side re­nun­ci­ation, rather than vi­ol­at­ing the concept of eu­phoria through its real­iz­a­tion.]{.calibre3}

[He­lio­trope]{.calibre22}[. -- Those await­ing the visit of the par­ents' guests, find their hearts beat­ing with greater ex­pect­a­tion than be­fore Christ­mas. It is not due to the presents, but to a trans­formed life. The per­fume, which the lady guest places on the bur­eau, while one is per­mit­ted to watch the un­pack­ing, has a scent like memory, even when it is in­haled for the first time. The lug­gage with the stick­ers from the Hotel Suvretta \[fam­ous hotel in St. Mor­itz, Switzer­land\] and Madonna di Cam­piglio \[fam­ous hotel in Do­molite moun­tains of Italy, near Trentino\] are chests, in which the pre­cious gems of Alad­din and Ali Baba, wrapped in ex­pens­ive cloth, the ki­monos of guests, are borne out of the cara­vanserais of Switzer­land and south Tyrol on sleep­ing-wagon cush­ions for sated ob­ser­va­tion. And just as fair­ies talk to chil­dren in fairy-tales, so too does the guest talk earn­estly, without con­des­cen­sion, to the chil­dren of the house. They ask know­ledge­ably about lands and peoples, and the guest, not ac­quain­ted with their daily habits and see­ing noth­ing but the fas­cin­a­tion in their eyes, an­swers with pro­found state­ments about the feeble-minded­ness of a brother-in-law and the mar­ital spats of the neph­ews. Thus the chil­dren feel ac­cep­ted at a stroke into the mighty and secret al­li­ance of adults, the ma­gic circle of reas­on­able people. The rules of the day are sus­pen­ded -- per­haps to­mor­row they may even be al­lowed to skip school -- along with the bor­ders between the gen­er­a­tions, and who­ever has not been sent to bed by el­even o\'clock has an ink­ling of true promis­cu­ity. The single visit or­dains Thursday as a fest­ival, in whose eu­phoria all of hu­man­ity seems to be in­vited. For the guest comes from far away. The guest's ap­pear­ance prom­ises the chil­dren some­thing bey­ond the fam­ily and re­minds them that this lat­ter is not the only thing. The long­ing for in­cho­ate hap­pi­ness, in the pond of sala­man­ders and storks, which the child pain­fully learned to re­strain and which is dis­tor­ted by the bo­gey­man of the black man, of the vil­lain who wishes to kid­nap them -- here the chil­dren find that long­ing again, without fear. Amidst the nearest and dearest, there ap­pears the fig­ure of what is dif­fer­ent. The for­tune-telling gypsy, who is let into the front door, is ab­solved in the lady vis­itor and trans­figured into a res­cuing an­gel. She dis­pels the curse on the hap­pi­ness of what is nearest of all, by wed­ding it to what is most dis­tant. The en­tire be­ing \[Da­sein\] of the child waits for this, and who­ever does not for­get the best part of child­hood, must still be able to wait like this. Love counts the hours un­til the mo­ment the par­ents' guests step over the threshold and once again re­con­struct the washed-out life through some­thing im­per­cept­ible: "Here I am again / back from the wide world." \[lines from Mörike's ]{.calibre3}[Per­eg­rina]{.calibre22}[\]]{.calibre3}

Just as all ac­quaint­ances feel the in­clin­a­tion, to oc­ca­sion­ally say some­thing bad about someone, prob­ably be­cause they rebel against the grey­ness of the ac­quaint­ance, so is every­one sim­ul­tan­eously sens­it­ive to the views of every­one else and secretly wish that they were loved, even where they do not love: the ali­en­a­tion between hu­man be­ings is no less in­dis­crim­in­ate and uni­ver­sal than the long­ing to break through it. The news-hawker blos­soms in this cli­mate, for there is never any lack of ma­ter­ial or calam­it­ies, and they can al­ways count on the fact that those who wish to be liked by all, are agog to hear news of the op­pos­ite. One should re­lay derog­at­ory re­marks only when they im­me­di­ately and trans­par­ently in­flu­ence com­mon de­cisions, to judg­ments of hu­man be­ings one must rely upon, or with whom one has to work. The more dis­in­ter­ested the re­port, the mur­kier the in­terest, the sup­pressed pleas­ure, in in­flict­ing pain. It is still harm­less, if story-tell­ers simply wish to set two parties against each other while sim­ul­tan­eously put­ting their own qual­it­ies in the spot­light. More of­ten they rep­res­ent them­selves as the un­elec­ted ar­bit­ers of pub­lic opin­ion and thereby im­press, pre­cisely through their af­fect­less ob­jectiv­ity, the en­tire vi­ol­ence of an­onym­ity upon the vic­tim, be­fore which this last is sup­posed to bow. The lie be­comes vis­ible in the un­ne­ces­sary con­cern for the honor of the one in­jured, who knows noth­ing of the in­jury, for clear re­la­tion­ships, for in­ner pur­ity: up­hold­ing these lat­ter in the en­tangled world only en­cour­ages, on the model of Gregers Werle \[char­ac­ter in Ib­sen's ]{.calibre3}[Wild Duck]{.calibre22}[\], en­tan­gle­ment. By vir­tue of moral fer­vor, the well-mean­ing turn into des­troy­ers. ]{.calibre3}

[And just hear, how evil he was. -- ]{.calibre22}[Those who have un­ex­pec­tedly ended up fa­cing life-threat­en­ing dangers, sheer cata­strophes, of­ten re­port that they were to a sur­pris­ing ex­tent free of fear. The gen­eral ter­ror does not turn spe­cific­ally against them, but strikes them as mere in­hab­it­ants of a city, mem­bers of a lar­ger as­so­ci­ation. They ad­apt to what is ac­ci­dental, what is in­an­im­ate, as it were, as if it didn't really con­cern them. The lack of fear has its psy­cho­lo­gical ex­plan­a­tion in the lack of read­i­ness to be afraid ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ the over­power­ing blow. The free­dom of eye­wit­nesses has some­thing dam­aged about it, some­thing re­lated to apathy. The psychic or­gan­ism, like the body, is com­pat­ible with ex­per­i­ences of an or­der of mag­nitude sim­ilar to it­self. If the ob­ject of ex­per­i­ence is raised out of pro­por­tion to the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\], then the lat­ter ac­tu­ally doesn't ex­per­i­ence it any­more, but re­gisters the former un­me­di­atedly, through the non-in­tu­it­ive concept, as some­thing ex­ternal to it­self, some­thing in­com­men­sur­able, to which the lat­ter relates as coldly as to the cata­strophic shock. There is an ana­logy to this in what is moral. Who­ever com­mits acts, which are egre­giously un­just ac­cord­ing to ac­know­ledged norms, such as tak­ing re­venge on en­emies, or re­fus­ing to be sym­path­etic, is scarcely con­scious of their guilt and comes to real­ize this only with pain­ful ef­fort. The doc­trine of reas­ons of state, the sep­ar­a­tion of eth­ics \[Moral\] and polit­ics is not un­touched by this state of af­fairs. Its mean­ing stems from the ex­treme op­pos­i­tion between pub­lic es­sence \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\] and in­di­vidual ex­ist­ence. The ma­jor crime presents it­self to the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] in large part as a mere mis­de­meanor against con­ven­tion, not merely be­cause the norms which it in­jures are them­selves some­thing con­ven­tional, frozen, un­bind­ing on the liv­ing sub­ject, but be­cause their ob­jec­ti­fic­a­tion as such, even where they are foun­ded on sub­stance, evades the moral in­nerv­a­tion, the realm of the con­science. The thought of spe­cific acts of tact­less­ness how­ever, the mi­croor­gan­isms of in­justice, which per­haps no-one else no­ticed -- that someone sits down too early in com­pany, or put the guests' name-tags down dur­ing tea-time, rather than at din­ner, as is cus­tom­ary -- such tri­vi­al­it­ies may fill the de­lin­quent one with ir­re­proach­able re­morse and a pas­sion­ately bad con­science, at times with such a burn­ing shame, that they can­not al­low them­selves to be pardoned by any other hu­man be­ing and prefer­ably not even by them­selves. They are therein by no means as noble as all that, for they know, that the so­ci­ety which has no ob­jec­tions against in­hu­man­ity, ob­jects all the more strongly to mis­con­duct, and that a man who sends away his lover and vouches for him­self as an up­right man, can be sure of so­cial ap­proval, while the man who re­spect­fully kisses the hand of an overly young girl from a good fam­ily, earns him­self ri­dicule. How­ever these lux­uri­ously nar­ciss­istic con­cerns af­ford a second as­pect: that of the refuge of ex­per­i­ence, which re­bounds from the ob­jec­ti­fied so­cial or­der. The sub­ject reaches into the smal­lest fea­tures of what is cor­rect or in­cor­rect and is cap­able of vouch­ing for it­self therein as act­ing rightly or wrongly; its in­dif­fer­ence to­wards moral guilt, how­ever, is tinged with the con­scious­ness that the power­less­ness of one's own de­cision grows with the di­men­sion of their ob­ject. If one es­tab­lished in ret­ro­spect, that by fail­ing to call one's girl­friend after an ugly quar­rel, this in fact ended the re­la­tion­ship, then there is some­thing faintly comic in the con­cep­tion of this; it sounds like the mute girl in Por­tici \[char­ac­ter in Daniel Au­ber's 1828 op­era ]{.calibre3}[The Mute Girl of Por­tici]{.calibre22}[\]. "Murder," goes an Ellery Queen de­tect­ive novel, "is so\... news­pa­pery. It doesn't hap­pen to you. You read about it in a pa­per, or in a de­tect­ive story, and it makes you wriggle with dis­gust, or sym­pathy. But it doesn't mean any­thing." \[Quote in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] That is why au­thors like Thomas Mann have de­scribed the cata­strophes broad­cast in the news­pa­pers, ran­ging from train ac­ci­dents to crimes of pas­sion, grot­esquely -- en­sor­cel­ing, as it were, the ir­res­ist­ible laughter which the sol­emn pomp of a burial would oth­er­wise pro­voke, by mak­ing it the af­fair \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[\] of the po­etic sub­ject. In con­trast to this, min­imal vi­ol­a­tions are for that reason rel­ev­ant, be­cause we can see good and evil in them, without smil­ing, even if our earn­est­ness is a bit de­lusory. In them we learn to deal with what is eth­ical \[]{.calibre3}[Mor­al­is­chen]{.calibre22}[\], feel­ing it in our skin -- as blush­ing -- mak­ing it the sub­ject's own, the sub­ject which glances as help­lessly at the gi­gantic moral-law in it­self as at the star-stud­ded heav­ens, which the former is badly modeled after. That these oc­cur­rences would be amoral in them­selves, while nev­er­the­less spon­tan­eously good im­pulses, hu­man sym­pathy without the pathos of max­ims, also oc­curs, does not de­value the in­fatu­ation in what is proper. For by ex­press­ing the gen­er­al­ity straight­away, without both­er­ing about ali­en­a­tion, the good im­pulse eas­ily enough per­mits the sub­ject to ap­pear as some­thing ali­en­ated from it­self, as a mere agent of com­mand­ments, with which that sub­ject ima­gines it­self to be as one: as a splen­did hu­man be­ing. Con­versely, those whose eth­ical im­pulse is ori­ented to what is ex­ternal, fet­ish­istic con­ven­tion, is cap­able of grasp­ing the gen­er­al­ity, in the suf­fer­ing of the un­sur­pass­able di­ver­gence of in­ner and outer -- in­deed by hold­ing fast to this di­ver­gence in its harden­ing -- without sac­ri­fi­cing them­selves and the truth of their ex­per­i­ence to such. Their over-voltage \[]{.calibre3}[Über­span­nung]{.calibre22}[\] of all dis­tance in­tends re­con­cili­ation. That is why the be­ha­vior of mono­ma­ni­acs is not without some jus­ti­fic­a­tion in the ob­ject. In the sphere of daily in­ter­ac­tions, on which they in­sist, all aporias of the false life re­turn, and what their blind al­ley has to do with the whole, is that only there can they carry out the paradig­matic con­flict in strict­ness and free­dom, which oth­er­wise es­capes their reach. In con­trast, who­ever con­forms in their mode of re­ac­tion with so­cial real­ity, finds their private life con­duct­ing it­self as form­lessly, as the es­tim­a­tion of power-re­la­tions which com­pels its form on them. They have the in­clin­a­tion, wherever they es­cape the su­per­vi­sion of the ex­ternal world, wherever they feel at home in the ex­pan­ded realm in their own ego, to re­veal them­selves to be in­con­sid­er­ate and bru­tal. They re­venge them­selves on those who are near to them, for all the dis­cip­line and all the re­nun­ci­ation of the im­me­di­ate ex­pres­sion of ag­gres­sion, which was im­posed on the former from a dis­tance. They be­have po­litely and with cour­tesy on the out­side, to­wards ob­ject­ive en­emies, but with cold­ness and hos­til­ity in friendly circles. Where civil­iz­a­tion as self-pre­ser­va­tion does not com­pel them to­wards hu­man­ity, they give free reign to their rage against such and re­but their own ideo­logy of home, fam­ily and com­munity. It is against this which eth­ics \[]{.calibre3}[Moral]{.calibre22}[\], how­ever mi­cro­lo­gic­ally de­luded, is aimed. It de­tects in the re­laxed fa­mili­ar­ity, in what is form­less, the mere pre­text for vi­ol­ence, the ap­peal to be good to each other, in or­der to be as malevol­ent as one wants to be. It sub­jug­ates what is in­tim­ate to the crit­ical claim, be­cause in­timacies ali­en­ate, grope to­wards the in­con­ceiv­ably fine aura of the other, which first crowns them to a sub­ject. Solely the ac­know­ledg­ment of dis­tance in who or what is most near \[]{.calibre3}[Näch­ste]{.calibre22}[\] mit­ig­ates for­eignness: ac­cep­ted into con­scious­ness. How­ever the claim of un­di­min­ished, already achieved near­ness, the flat denial of for­eignness, does the ut­most in­justice to the other, vir­tu­ally neg­at­ing them as par­tic­u­lar hu­man be­ings and thereby what is hu­man in them, "adds them up," in­cor­por­ates them into the in­vent­ory of prop­erty. Wherever what is un­me­di­ated pos­its and en­sconces it­self, the bad me­di­acy of so­ci­ety is thereby in­si­di­ously af­firmed. The is­sue \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[\] of im­me­di­acy can be taken up only by the most cau­tious of re­flec­tions. The test of this is made in the smal­lest of all things. ]{.calibre3}

[Il servo padrone.]{.calibre22}[ \[Italian: the mas­ter as ser­vant\] -- In re­gards to the dull-wit­ted tasks, which are de­man­ded by the rul­ing cul­ture from sub­or­din­ate classes, these lat­ter be­come cap­able of such solely through per­man­ent re­gres­sion. Pre­cisely what is un­formed in them is the product of so­cial form. The cre­ation of bar­bar­i­ans through cul­ture is how­ever con­stantly de­ployed by this lat­ter, in or­der to pre­serve its own bar­baric es­sence. Dom­in­a­tion del­eg­ates the phys­ical vi­ol­ence, on which it rests, to the dom­in­ated. While these lat­ter are given the op­por­tun­ity of let­ting off steam with their warped in­stincts in what is col­lect­ively jus­ti­fied and proper, they learn to prac­tice what the noble ones re­quire, so that they have what it takes to let the noble ones re­main noble. The self-edu­ca­tion of the rul­ing clique, with all of the dis­cip­line, throt­tling of every im­me­di­ate im­pulse, cyn­ical skep­ti­cism and blind pleas­ure in com­mand it de­mands, would not ex­ist if the op­pressor did not in­flict, through those who are op­pressed, a piece of the op­pres­sion on them­selves, which they in­flict on oth­ers. That is why the psy­cho­lo­gical dif­fer­ences between the classes are so much slighter than the ob­ject­ive-eco­nomic ones. The har­mony of what is ir­re­con­cil­able comes to be­ne­fit the con­tinu­ation of the bad to­tal­ity. The nas­ti­ness of the higher-ups and the gutsi­ness of the low-born un­der­stand each other. From the ser­vants and gov­ernors, who bully the chil­dren of good house­holds to teach them a les­son about life, to the teach­ers from West­er­wald, who drive the us­age of for­eign words as well as all pleas­ure in lan­guage out of them, to the of­fi­cials and clerks, who make them stand in line, the petty of­ficers, who step on them, things go straight as a rail to the tor­tur­ers of the Gestapo and the bur­eau­crats of the gas cham­bers. The im­pulses of the up­per classes them­selves speak early in fa­vor of the del­eg­a­tion of vi­ol­ence to the lower ones. Who­ever fears the good breed­ing of the par­ents, flees into the kit­chen and warms them­selves on the en­er­getic ex­pres­sions of the cook, which are secretly given over to the prin­ciple of par­ental good-breed­ing. The fine people are drawn to the un­re­fined ones, whose bru­tal­ity de­cept­ively au­gurs, what the cul­ture of the former is sup­posed to bring. They do not know, that what is un­re­fined, which ap­pears to them as an­archic nature, is noth­ing but the re­flex of the com­pul­sion, against which they stiffen them­selves. What me­di­ates between the class solid­ar­ity of the up­per classes and their in­gra­ti­ation to­wards the del­eg­ates of the lower classes is their jus­ti­fied feel­ing of guilt to­wards the poor. Who­ever who doesn't fit in, who learns how­ever to fit in, who is sat­ur­ated by "that's how things are done here" into the in­ner­most core, ul­ti­mately turns into one them­selves. Bettel­heim's ob­ser­va­tion on the iden­ti­fic­a­tion of the vic­tims with the ex­e­cu­tion­ers of the Nazi camps con­tains a judg­ment on the higher seed­ing-grounds of cul­ture, the Eng­lish "pub­lic school" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], the Ger­man of­ficer academy. The ab­surdity per­petu­ates it­self: dom­in­a­tion re­pro­duces it­self all the way through the dom­in­ated.]{.calibre3}

[Down­wards and ever fur­ther. ]{.calibre22}[\[quote from Schubert song\] -- The private re­la­tions between hu­man be­ings seem to form them­selves ac­cord­ing to the model of the in­dus­trial "bot­tle­neck" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]. Even in the smal­lest com­munity, the level is de­term­ined by the most sub­al­tern of its mem­bers. Who­ever says some­thing in a con­ver­sa­tion which is bey­ond the grasp of a single per­son, be­comes tact­less. For the sake of hu­man­ity, the con­ver­sa­tion is re­stric­ted to what is nearest, most dull-wit­ted and banal, even if only one in­hu­man vis­age is present. Since the world has stolen speech from hu­man be­ings, those who can­not be talked to are in the right. They need only stub­bornly in­sist on their in­terest and their con­sti­tu­tion, in or­der to pre­vail. The fact that the other, try­ing in vain to es­tab­lish con­tact, ends up us­ing a plead­ing or so­li­cit­ing ca­dence, makes them weaker. Since the "bot­tle­neck" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] knows no au­thor­ity, which would be higher than what is fac­tual, while thought and speech ne­ces­sar­ily refer to such an au­thor­ity, in­tel­li­gence turns into ]{.calibre3}[naïvété]{.calibre22}[, and this is what the knuckle­heads ir­re­fut­ably per­ceive. The of­fi­cial fealty to what is pos­it­ive acts like grav­ity, draw­ing every­one down. It shows its su­peri­or­ity to the op­pos­ing im­pulse, by re­fus­ing to even deal with the lat­ter. Those who are more dif­fer­en­ti­ated, who do not wish to per­ish, re­main strictly con­strained by the con­sid­er­a­tion of every­one who is in­con­sid­er­ate. These lat­ter need no longer be plagued by the dis­quiet of con­scious­ness. In­tel­lec­tual weak­ness, con­firmed as a uni­ver­sal prin­ciple, ap­pears as the en­ergy to live. Form­al­istic-ad­min­is­trat­ive task man­age­ment, the desk-drawer sep­ar­a­tion of everything which only has mean­ing as some­thing in­sep­ar­able, the bull-headed in­sist­ence on ar­bit­rary opin­ions in the ab­sence of any found­a­tion, in short the prac­tice of re­ify­ing every stage of the failed ego-form­a­tion, with­draw­ing the lat­ter from the pro­cess of ex­per­i­ence and then main­tain­ing it as a fi­nal "that's just how I am," suf­fices to con­quer im­preg­nable po­s­i­tions. One may be as cer­tain of the un­der­stand­ing of oth­ers, who are sim­il­arly mal­formed, as of one's own ad­vant­age. In the cyn­ical self-trum­pet­ing of one's own de­fect lurks the in­tu­ition, that the ob­ject­ive Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] is li­quid­at­ing the sub­ject­ive one at the con­tem­por­ary stage.

[Model vir­tue]{.calibre22}[. -- It is well-known how op­pres­sion and eth­ics \[Moral\] con­verge in the re­nun­ci­ation of the drives. But the eth­ical ideas do not merely op­press other ones, but are im­me­di­ately de­rived from the ex­ist­ence of the op­pressor. Since Homer, the con­cepts of good and wealth are in­ter­twined in the Greek lan­guage. The kalok­agathie \[Greek: per­fec­tion\], which was up­held by the hu­man­ists of mod­ern so­ci­ety as a model of aes­thetic-eth­ical har­mony, has al­ways put a heavy em­phasis on prop­erty, and Ar­is­totele's ]{.calibre3}[Polit­ics]{.calibre22}[ openly con­fessed the fu­sion of in­ner value with status in the de­term­in­a­tion of no­bil­ity, as "in­her­ited wealth, which is con­nec­ted with ex­cel­lence." The concept of the polis \[Greek: city-state\] in clas­sical an­tiquity, which up­held in­tern­al­ized and ex­tern­al­ized nature \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\], the valid­ity of the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] in the city-state and the in­di­vidual's self as a unity, per­mit­ted it to ascribe moral rank to wealth, without in­cit­ing the crude sus­pi­cion, which the doc­trine already at that time cour­ted. If the vis­ible ef­fect on an ex­ist­ent state es­tab­lishes the meas­ure of a hu­man be­ing, then it is noth­ing but con­sist­ency to vouch­safe the ma­ter­ial wealth, which tan­gibly con­firms that ef­fect, as the char­ac­ter­istic of the per­son, since the lat­ter's moral sub­stance -- just as later in Hegel's philo­sophy -- is sup­posed to be con­sti­tuted on noth­ing other than their par­ti­cip­a­tion in the ob­ject­ive, so­cial sub­stance. Chris­tian­ity first neg­ated that iden­ti­fic­a­tion, in the phrase that it would be easier to pass a camel through the eye of a needle than for a rich per­son to enter heaven. But the par­tic­u­lar theo­lo­gical premise on vol­un­tary chosen poverty in­dic­ates how deeply the gen­eral con­scious­ness is stamped by the ethos \[]{.calibre3}[Mor­al­ität]{.calibre22}[\] of prop­erty. Fixed prop­erty is to be dis­tin­guished from the no­madic dis­order, against which all norms are dir­ec­ted; to be good and to have goods, co­in­cided from the be­gin­ning. Good people are those who con­trol them­selves as their own pos­ses­sions: their autonom­ous nature \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\] is modeled on ma­ter­ial dis­pos­i­tion. The rich are there­fore not to be ac­cused of be­ing un­eth­ical -- that re­proach has ever be­longed to the arma­ture of polit­ical op­pres­sion -- but given to un­der­stand, that they rep­res­ent eth­ics \[Moral\] to oth­ers. In this lat­ter is re­flec­ted hav­ing \[]{.calibre3}[Habe]{.calibre22}[\]. Wealth as good­li­ness \[Gut­sein: hav­ing goods/be­ing good\] is an ele­ment of the mor­tar of the world: the hard-bit­ten ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of such iden­tity hinders the con­front­a­tion of the moral idea with the so­cial or­der, in which the rich are right, while at the same time de­term­in­a­tions of what is eth­ical dif­fer­ent than those de­rived from wealth can­not be con­cep­tu­al­ized. The more that the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] and so­ci­ety later di­verged in the com­pet­i­tion of in­terests, and the more the former is thrown back on it­self, the more stub­bornly do in­di­vidu­als hold onto the con­cep­tion of moral nature \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\] as wealth. It is sup­posed to vouch for the pos­sib­il­ity of re­uni­fy­ing what has been di­vided in two, into in­side and out­side. That is the secret of the in­ner-worldly as­ceti­cism, which Max Weber wrongly hy­po­stat­ized as the lim­it­less ex­er­tion of the busi­ness­man ad ]{.calibre3}[ma­jorem dei gloriam]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: to the greater glory of God\]. Ma­ter­ial suc­cess binds in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] and so­ci­ety not merely in the com­fort­able and mean­while du­bi­ous sense, that the rich can es­cape loneli­ness, but in a far more rad­ical sense: if the blind, isol­ated self-in­terest is driven only far enough, then it passes over, along with the eco­nomic one, into so­cial power and re­veals it­self to be the in­carn­a­tion of a uni­ver­sally bind­ing prin­ciple. Who­ever is rich or ac­quires wealth, ex­per­i­ences what is at­tained by the ego, "by one's own ini­ti­at­ive," as what the ob­ject­ive Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], the truly ir­ra­tional pre­des­tin­a­tion of a so­ci­ety held to­gether by bru­tal eco­nomic in­equal­ity, has willed. Thus the rich may reckon as be­ne­vol­ence, what test­i­fies only to its ab­sence. To them­selves and to oth­ers, they ex­per­i­ence them­selves as the real­iz­a­tion of the gen­eral prin­ciple. Be­cause this lat­ter is in­justice, that is why the un­just turn reg­u­larly into the just, and not as mere il­lu­sion, but borne out of the he­ge­mony of the law, ac­cord­ing to which so­ci­ety re­pro­duces it­self. The wealth of the in­di­vidual is in­sep­ar­able from pro­gress in so­ci­ety as "pre­his­tory." The rich dis­pose over the means of pro­duc­tion. Con­sequently the tech­nical pro­gress, in which the en­tire so­ci­ety par­ti­cip­ates, is ac­coun­ted for primar­ily as "their" pro­gress, today that of in­dustry, and the Fords ne­ces­sar­ily ap­pear to be be­ne­fact­ors, to the same de­gree which they in fact are, given the frame­work of the ex­ist­ing re­la­tions of pro­duc­tion. Their priv­ilege, already es­tab­lished in ad­vance, makes it seem as if they were giv­ing up what is theirs -- namely the in­crease on the side of use-value -- while those who are re­ceiv­ing their ad­min­istered bless­ings are get­ting back only part of the profit. That is the ground of the char­ac­ter of de­lu­sion of eth­ical hier­archy. Poverty has in­deed al­ways been glor­i­fied as as­ceti­cism, the so­cial con­di­tion for the ac­quis­i­tion of pre­cisely the wealth in which mor­al­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Sit­t­lich­keit]{.calibre22}[\] is mani­fes­ted, but nev­er­the­less "what a man is worth" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] sig­ni­fies, as every­one knows, the bank ac­count -- in the jar­gon of the Ger­man mer­chants, "the man is good," i.e. they can pay. What how­ever the reas­ons of state of the almighty eco­nomy so cyn­ic­ally con­fesses, reaches un­ac­know­ledged into the mode of con­duct of in­di­vidu­als. The gen­er­os­ity in private in­ter­course, which the rich can pre­sum­ably al­low them­selves, the re­flec­ted glow of hap­pi­ness, which rests on them, and some­thing of this falls on every­one who they con­sort with, all this veils them. They re­main nice, "the right people" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], the bet­ter types, the good. Wealth dis­tances it­self from im­me­di­ate in­justice. The guard beats strikers with a billy club, the son of the fact­ory-owner may oc­ca­sion­ally drink a whisky with the pro­gress­ive au­thor. Ac­cord­ing to all de­sid­erata of private eth­ics \[Moral\], even the most ad­vanced kind, the rich could, if they only could, in fact al­ways bet­ter be than the poor. This pos­sib­il­ity, while truly in­deed left un­used, plays its role in the ideo­logy of those who do not have it: even the con­victed con artist, who may any­way be prefer­able to the le­git­im­ate boss of the trusts, is fam­ous for hav­ing such a beau­ti­ful house, and the highly paid ex­ec­ut­ive turns into a warm hu­man be­ing, the mo­ment they serve an op­u­lent din­ner. Today's bar­baric re­li­gion of suc­cess is ac­cord­ingly not simply counter-eth­ical \[]{.calibre3}[wi­der­m­or­al­isch]{.calibre22}[\], rather it is the home-com­ing of the West to the ven­er­able mor­als \[]{.calibre3}[Sit­ten]{.calibre22}[\] of the fath­ers. Even the norms, which con­demn the ar­range­ment of the world, owe their ex­ist­ence to the lat­ter's own mis­chief \[Un]{.calibre3}[wesen]{.calibre22}[\]. All eth­ics \[]{.calibre3}[Moral]{.calibre22}[\] is formed on the model of what is un­eth­ical \[]{.calibre3}[Un­moral]{.calibre22}[\], and to this day re­pro­duces the lat­ter at every stage.

[Knight of the rose. ]{.calibre22}[\[Op­era by Richard Strauss\] -- El­eg­ant people are at­tract­ive due to the ex­pect­a­tion that they are free in private from the greed for the ad­vant­ages, which flow to them from their po­s­i­tion, and from the stub­born pre­ju­dice in the closest re­la­tion­ships, which is caused by the nar­row­ness of these last. One has con­fid­ence in their pleas­ure of ad­ven­ture in thought, sov­er­eignty ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ the state of their own in­terests, and re­fine­ment of forms of re­ac­tion, think­ing that their sens­it­iv­ity would turn at least in Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] against the bru­tal­ity on which their priv­ilege de­pends, while the vic­tims scarcely have the pos­sib­il­ity to re­cog­nize what makes them such. If how­ever the sep­ar­a­tion of pro­duc­tion and the private-sphere ul­ti­mately proves to be a piece of ne­ces­sary so­cial ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[s\], then this ex­pect­a­tion of un­bound spir­itu­al­ity must be dis­ap­poin­ted. Even the most subtle snob­bery has noth­ing of ]{.calibre3}[dégoût]{.calibre22}[ \[French: dis­gust\] ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ its ob­ject­ive pre­requis­ite, but rather seals it­self off from its cog­ni­tion. It is an open ques­tion as to what ex­tent the French ar­is­to­cracy of the 18th cen­tury took part, play­fully-sui­cid­ally, in the en­light­en­ment and the pre­par­a­tion for the re­volu­tion, a par­ti­cip­a­tion which the an­ti­pathy against the ter­ror­ists of vir­tue was so glad to ima­gine. The bour­geoisie in any case has kept it­self free in its later phase from such in­clin­a­tions. No-one dances any­more on the vol­cano, oth­er­wise they would be de­classed. Sub­ject­ively, too, the "so­ci­ety" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] is so thor­oughly stamped by the eco­nomic prin­ciple, whose man­ner of ra­tion­al­ity con­cerns the whole, that the eman­cip­a­tion from in­terests -- even merely as in­tel­lec­tual lux­ury -- is for­bid­den. Just as they are not cap­able of en­joy­ing their im­meas­ur­ably ex­pan­ded wealth, they are equally in­cap­able of think­ing against them­selves. The search for frivolity is in vain. What helps to etern­al­ize the real dis­tinc­tion between the up­per and lower strata, is the fact that the dis­tinc­tion between the modes of con­scious­ness, both here and there, is van­ish­ing more and more. The poor are pre­ven­ted from think­ing by the dis­cip­line of oth­ers, the rich from that of their own. The con­scious­ness of the rulers is in­scrib­ing in all Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], what pre­vi­ously re­li­gion en­dured. Cul­ture turns for the high bour­geoisie into an ele­ment of rep­res­ent­a­tion. That one is clever or edu­cated, is ranked un­der the qual­it­ies which make one worthy of in­vit­a­tion or mar­riage, like horse-rid­ing skills, love of nature, charm or a fault­lessly tailored suit. They are not curi­ous about cog­ni­tion. Free of cares, they mostly busy them­selves with mundane de­tails, just like the small bour­geoisie. They fur­nish houses, throw parties, make hotel and air­plane re­ser­va­tions with vir­tu­os­ity. Oth­er­wise they nour­ish them­selves on the re­fuse of European ir­ra­tion­al­ism. They bluntly jus­tify their own hos­til­ity to the in­tel­lect \[]{.calibre3}[Geist­feind­schaft]{.calibre22}[\], already sus­pect­ing -- and not un­justly -- some­thing sub­vers­ive in think­ing it­self, in the in­de­pend­ence from any­thing which is already given or already ex­ist­ing. Just as in Ni­et­z­sche's time, when edu­cated phil­istines be­lieved in pro­gress, the uni­formly higher de­vel­op­ment of the masses and the greatest pos­sible hap­pi­ness of the greatest pos­sible num­ber, so too do they be­lieve today, without quite know­ing it, in the op­pos­ite: the re­voc­a­tion of 1789, the in­cor­ri­gib­il­ity of hu­man nature, the an­thro­po­lo­gical im­possib­il­ity of hap­pi­ness -- ac­tu­ally only that things are all too good for the work­ers. The pro­fund­ity of yes­teryear has re­coiled into the most ex­treme banal­ity. Of Ni­et­z­sche and Bergson, the last can­on­ized philo­soph­ers, noth­ing re­mains but the mur­ki­est anti-in­tel­lec­tu­al­ism in the name of the nature, which its apo­lo­gists mu­til­ate. "Noth­ing is more an­noy­ing to me about the Third Reich," said in 1933 the Jew­ish wo­man of a gen­eral dir­ector, who was later murdered in Po­land, "than the fact that we can no longer use the word earthly, be­cause the Nazis have im­poun­ded it," and even after the down­fall of the Fas­cists, the at­tract­ive Aus­trian lady of a wealthy house, on meet­ing a labor union leader at a cock­tail party with a repu­ta­tion as a rad­ical, knew no bet­ter way to ex­press her en­thu­si­asm for his per­son­al­ity than the bes­tial ex­pres­sion: "and moreover he is totally un­in­tel­lec­tual, totally un­in­tel­lec­tual." I re­mem­ber my own shock, when an ar­is­to­cratic girl of shad­owy ori­gins, who could barely speak Ger­man to me with a thick for­eign ac­cent, ex­pressed her sym­pathy for Hitler, with whose pic­ture her own seemed in­com­pat­ible. At that time I thought, sheer idiocy pre­vents her from see­ing who she is. But she was more clever than I, for what she rep­res­en­ted, no longer ex­is­ted, and by can­cel­ling out her in­di­vidual de­term­in­a­tion, her class con­scious­ness helped her be­ing-in-her­self, her so­cial char­ac­ter, to break through. Those at the top are in­teg­rat­ing with such iron force, that the pos­sib­il­ity of sub­ject­ive de­vi­ation falls away and nowhere can dif­fer­ence be sought any­more than in the dis­tin­guished cut of an even­ing gown.]{.calibre3}

[Re­quiem for Odette]{.calibre22}[. \[fe­male char­ac­ter in Proust's ]{.calibre3}[Swann's Way]{.calibre22}[\] -- The Anglo­m­ania of the up­per classes of con­tin­ental Europe is based on the fact that feudal prac­tices are ritu­al­ized on the Brit­ish isle, which are sup­posed to suf­fice in them­selves. Cul­ture is main­tained there not as the di­vided sphere of ob­ject­ive Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[\], as par­ti­cip­a­tion in art or philo­sophy, but rather as a form of em­pir­ical ex­ist­ence. The "high life" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] wishes to be the beau­ti­ful life. It brings those, who par­take in it, ideo­lo­gical pleas­ure-win­nings. By turn­ing the shap­ing of ex­ist­ence into a task, in which one fol­lows guidelines, pre­serves ar­ti­fi­cial styles, and keeps the del­ic­ate equi­lib­rium of cor­rect­ness and in­de­pend­ence, ex­ist­ence it­self ap­pears as mean­ing­ful and calms the bad con­science of those who are so­cially su­per­flu­ous. The in­cess­ant de­mand, to say and do that which is ex­actly ap­pro­pri­ate to one's status and situ­ation, de­mands a kind of moral ef­fort. It be­comes dif­fi­cult, to be who you are, and this is be­lieved to be suf­fi­cient for the pat­ri­archal noblesse ob­lige \[French: ob­lig­a­tion of the high-born\]. At the same time the dis­place­ment of cul­ture from its ob­ject­ive mani­fest­a­tions into the im­me­di­ate life dis­solves the risk that one's own im­me­di­acy will be shaken by the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\]. This last is re­proached for dis­turb­ing as­sured styles, for be­ing taste­less, al­though not with the em­bar­rass­ing bru­tal­ity of the East Prus­sian Junker, but rather ac­cord­ing to a spir­itual cri­terion, as it were -- the aes­thet­i­ciz­a­tion of every­day life. This gives rise to the flat­ter­ing il­lu­sion, that one has been spared the split between su­per­struc­ture and in­fra­struc­ture, cul­ture and cor­por­eal real­ity. But rituals fall, in all their ar­is­to­cratic trap­pings, into the late bour­geois habit of hy­po­stat­iz­ing the at­tain­ment of some­thing mean­ing­less in it­self as mean­ing­ful, de­grad­ing the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] to the doub­ling of that which ex­ists any­way. The norm which one fol­lows is fict­ive, its so­cial pre­requis­ites have van­ished along with its model, the court ce­re­mony, and it is ac­know­ledged not be­cause it is ex­per­i­enced as bind­ing, but for the sake of le­git­im­at­ing the so­cial or­der, from whose il­le­git­im­acy one be­ne­fits. Proust thus ob­served, with the in­cor­rupt­ib­il­ity of someone sus­cept­ible to se­duc­tion, that Anglo­m­ania and the cult of a form-driven mode of liv­ing are to be found less in ar­is­to­crats than in those who wish to as­cend into the heights: it is only a step from snob to parvenu. Thus the af­fin­ity of snob­bery and Ju­gend­stil \[Art Nou­veau\], the at­tempt by a class defined by ex­change, to pro­ject them­selves into a pic­ture of ve­get­able beauty, as it were, pur­i­fied of ex­change. That the life which or­gan­izes its own events is not any more of a life, be­comes ap­par­ent in the bore­dom of the cock­tail parties and the week­end in­vit­a­tions to the coun­tryside, in the golf, sym­bolic of the en­tire sphere, and in the or­gan­iz­a­tion of "so­cial af­fairs" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] -- priv­ileges, where no-one has any real fun and with which the priv­ileged only de­ceive them­selves, about how little op­por­tun­ity for joy in the un­happy whole ex­ists even for them. In the latest phase, the beau­ti­ful life is re­duced to what Veblen char­ac­ter­ized it as through­out the ages, os­ten­ta­tion, the mere be­ing-se­lec­ted, and the park of­fers no other pleas­ure any­more than that of the wall, against which those out­side can press their noses. What can be crassly ob­served in the up­per classes, whose malice is in any case be­ing ir­res­ist­ibly demo­crat­ized, is what has long been true for so­ci­ety: life has turned into the ideo­logy of its own ab­sence. ]{.calibre3}

[When it comes to truly evil people, one can­not really ima­gine them dy­ing. To say "we" and to mean "I" is one of the choicest of all slights. Between "I dreamt" \[]{.calibre3}[es träumte mir]{.calibre22}[\] and "I dreamed" \[]{.calibre3}[ich träumte]{.calibre22}[\] lie ages of the world. But which is truer? So little do spir­its send dreams, so little is it the ego which dreams. Be­fore the eighty-fifth birth­day of an in all re­spects well cared-for man, I dreamed that I asked my­self the ques­tion, what could I give him which would make him truly happy, and im­me­di­ately re­ceived the an­swer: a guide through the realm of the dead. That Leporello com­plained about in­suf­fi­cient pro­vi­sions and too little money, is a reason to doubt the ex­ist­ence of Don Juan.

First it goes: "And around the corner crash­ing brays, like thump­ing tu­bas on Judg­ment Day," and it closes: "Did a bright but­ter­fly dart / ching-ching boom, around the corner?" A po­etic philo­sophy of his­tory of vi­ol­ence, with Judg­ment Day at the be­gin­ning and the but­ter­fly at the end. In Trakl's ]{.calibre3}[Along]{.calibre22}[ there is the verse: "Say how long we have been dead"; in Däu­bler's ]{.calibre3}[Golden Son­net]{.calibre22}[: "How true, that we have all long since died." The unity of ex­pres­sion­ism con­sisted of ex­press­ing the fact that the hu­man be­ings into which life has with­drawn, wholly ali­en­ated from each other, are turned thereby into the dead. Among the forms which Borch­ardt tested, there is no lack of re­work­ings of folk songs. He avoided say­ing "In peoples' tone," and wrote in­stead: "In the tone of the people." This sounds how­ever just like "in the name of the law." The res­tor­at­ive poet re­coils into the Prus­sian po­lice of­ficer. Not the least of the tasks which stands be­fore thought, is put­ting all the re­ac­tion­ary ar­gu­ments against West­ern cul­ture into the ser­vice of ad­van­cing en­light­en­ment.

[The bad com­rade]{.calibre22}[. -- Ac­tu­ally I should have been able to de­duce Fas­cism from the memory of my child­hood. It sent its emis­sar­ies there in ad­vance, like a con­queror into the most dis­tant province, long be­fore it ar­rived: my school com­rades. If the bour­geois class har­bored since time im­me­morial the dream of the wild pop­u­lar com­munity, the op­pres­sion of all by all, then chil­dren with first names like Horst and Jür­gen and last names like Ber­gen­roth, Bojunga and Eck­hardt, the­at­ric­ally staged the dream, be­fore the adults were his­tor­ic­ally ripe enough to real­ize it. I felt the vi­ol­ence of the im­age of hor­ror they were striv­ing for so clearly, that all hap­pi­ness af­ter­wards seemed to be re­voc­able and bor­rowed. The out­break of the Third Reich did in­deed sur­prise my polit­ical judg­ment, yet not my fear­ful pre­mon­i­tions. So closely had all the mo­tifs of the per­man­ent cata­strophe brushed against me, so in­ex­tin­guish­ably were the warn­ing signs of the Ger­man awaken­ing burned into me, that I re­cog­nized each one all over again in the fea­tures of the Hitler dic­tat­or­ship: and of­ten it ap­peared to my fool­ish hor­ror, as if the total state had been in­ven­ted solely against me, in or­der to in­flict on me what I had been hitherto spared in my child­hood, that state's pre­his­tory. The five pat­ri­ots who at­tacked a single school­mate, beat him up and, when he com­plained to the teacher, de­famed him as a classroom snitch -- aren't they the same ones, who tor­tured pris­on­ers, in or­der to prove the for­eign­ers wrong, who said that tor­ture was oc­cur­ring? Whose hul­la­boo knew no end, when the smartest stu­dent made a mis­take -- didn't they sur­round the Jew­ish camp pris­oner, grin­ning and em­bar­rassed, mak­ing fun of him, after he all too clum­sily sought to hang him­self? Who couldn't write a single de­cent sen­tence, but found every one of mine too long -- didn't they ab­ol­ish Ger­man lit­er­at­ure and re­place it through their scrib­ing \[]{.calibre3}[Schrifttum]{.calibre22}[\]? Many covered their chests with mys­ter­i­ous in­signia and wanted to be­come naval of­ficers in a land­locked coun­try: they de­clared them­selves lead­ers of storm troop­ers and de­tach­ments, the le­git­im­izers of il­le­git­im­a­tion. The in­vol­uted in­tel­li­gent ones, who had as little suc­cess in class as the gif­ted tinkerer without con­nec­tions un­der lib­er­al­ism; who for that reason cur­ried fa­vor with their par­ents with wood­saw work, or in­deed drew for their own pleas­ure on draw­ing-boards with colored inks dur­ing long af­ter­noon days, helped the Third Reich to its cruel ef­fi­ciency and are be­ing be­trayed once again. Those how­ever who al­ways de­fi­antly stirred up trouble against the teacher and, as one called it, dis­turbed the les­son, the day -- in­deed, the hour -- they gradu­ated from high school, they sat down with the same teach­ers at the same table with the same beer, as a con­fed­er­a­tion of men, who were born fol­low­ers, rebels, whose im­pa­tient blows of the fist on the table already drummed the wor­ship of the mas­ters. They need only stay put, to catch up with those who were pro­moted to the next class, and re­venge them­selves on them. Since they, of­fi­cials and can­did­ates for death sen­tences, have stepped vis­ibly out of my dreams and have ex­pro­pri­ated my past life and my lan­guage, I don't need to dream of them any longer. In Fas­cism, the night­mare of child­hood has real­ized it­self.]{.calibre3}

[Puzzle-pic­ture]{.calibre22}[. -- Why, in spite of a his­tor­ical de­vel­op­ment which has driven to­wards ol­ig­archy, work­ers are ever less able to know that they are such, can be gleaned from many ob­ser­va­tions. While the re­la­tion­ship of prop­erty-own­ers and pro­du­cers is ob­ject­ively con­geal­ing ever more ri­gidly, sub­ject­ive class-mem­ber­ship is fluc­tu­at­ing more and more. This is abet­ted by eco­nomic de­vel­op­ment it­self. The or­ganic com­pos­i­tion of cap­ital de­mands, as has of­ten been noted, con­trol by tech­nical man­agers rather than fact­ory own­ers. These lat­ter were the counter-party, as it were, to liv­ing labor, the former cor­res­pon­ded to the share of ma­chinery in cap­ital. The quan­ti­fic­a­tion of tech­nical pro­cesses, how­ever, its com­part­ment­al­iz­a­tion in the smal­lest op­er­a­tions, for the most part in­de­pend­ent of ex­per­i­ence and edu­ca­tion, turns the ex­pert status of the new-styled dir­ect­ors to a con­sid­er­able ex­tent into a mere il­lu­sion, be­hind which is con­cealed the priv­ilege of be­ing ap­poin­ted. That tech­nical de­vel­op­ment has reached a state, that all func­tions would ac­tu­ally be ac­cess­ible to all -- this im­man­ent-so­cial­istic ele­ment of pro­gress is trav­estied by late in­dus­tri­al­ism. Mem­ber­ship in an elite ap­pears achiev­able for every­one. One waits only for the co­opta­tion. Eli­gib­il­ity con­sists in af­fin­ity, ran­ging from the li­bid­in­ous cathexis of all wheel­ing and deal­ing, to sound tech­no­cratic sens­ib­il­ity, to freshly-cured ]{.calibre3}[real­politik]{.calibre22}[. They are ex­perts only of con­trol. That any­one can do such, has not led to its end, but only that every­one may be called upon to do such. Pref­er­ence is given to those who fit in most ex­actly. While the chosen ones cer­tainly re­main a van­ish­ing minor­ity, the struc­tural pos­sib­il­ity suf­fices to suc­cess­fully pre­serve the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of an equal chance un­der the sys­tem, which has elim­in­ated the free com­pet­i­tion which lived on that ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\]. That the tech­nical forces would per­mit a non-priv­ileged con­di­tion, is cred­ited by all, even those in the shad­ows, to the so­cial re­la­tion­ships, which hinder it. In gen­eral, sub­ject­ive class-mem­ber­ship today shows a mo­bil­ity, which causes the fix­ity of eco­nomic so­cial or­der to be for­got­ten: what is ri­gid is also what can be moved about. Even the power­less­ness of the in­di­vidual, to cal­cu­late out its eco­nomic des­tiny, con­trib­utes to such a con­sol­ing mo­bil­ity. What de­cides on the fall is not lack of pro­fi­ciency, but an opaque hier­archal web, in which no-one, not even at the very top, may feel safe: the egal­it­ari­an­ism of the con­di­tion of be­ing threatened. When the heroic fly­ing cap­tain re­turns home, in the most suc­cess­ful block­buster film of the year, to be bul­lied by petit bour­geois ca­ri­ca­tures as a "soda jerk" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], he does not only sat­isfy the schaden­freude of the spec­tat­ors, but even strengthens them moreover in the con­scious­ness, that all hu­man be­ings are truly broth­ers \[ref­er­ence to the 1946 ]{.calibre3}[The Best Years of Our Lives]{.calibre22}[\]. The most ex­treme in­justice turns into the de­cept­ive im­age of justice, the dis­qual­i­fic­a­tion of hu­man be­ings into their equal­ity.

To be sure, ex­clus­ive­ness, which stems from noth­ing bet­ter than a ground-mono­poly, is ideo­logy. But it was nev­er­the­less im­prin­ted deeply enough into the char­ac­ter, to stiffen its neck against the mar­ket. The Ger­man rul­ing class dis­paraged any way of earn­ing money out­side of priv­ileges or con­trol of pro­duc­tion well into the 20th cen­tury. What was con­sidered dis­rep­ut­able about artists or the edu­cated, was what these lat­ter most re­belled against, re­mu­ner­a­tion, and the private tu­tor Hölder­lin as well as the pi­an­ist Liszt, had therein pre­cisely those ex­per­i­ences, which set them in op­pos­i­tion to the rul­ing con­scious­ness. Well into our day, the mem­ber­ship of hu­man be­ings in the up­per or lower classes has been crudely de­term­ined by whether they took money or not. At times the bad ar­rog­ance re­coiled into con­scious cri­tique. Every child of the European up­per crust blushed at the gifts of money, which re­l­at­ives gave them, and al­though the primacy of bour­geois util­ity quelled such re­ac­tions and over­com­pensated for them, doubts re­mained non­ethe­less as to whether hu­man be­ings were made merely for ex­change. The rem­nants of what was older were, in the European con­scious­ness, the fer­ment of what was new. In Amer­ica by con­trast no child of sim­il­arly well-off par­ents has any qualms about earn­ing a few cents through news­pa­per de­liv­er­ies, and such thought­less­ness is ex­pressed in the habitus of adults. That is why Amer­ic­ans ap­pear to un­tutored Europeans on the whole as a people without dig­nity, ready for paid ser­vices, just as con­versely the former are in­clined to con­sider the lat­ter vag­a­bonds and card­board roy­alty. The self-evid­ence of the maxim, that there's no shame in work­ing, the guile­less ab­sence of any snob­bery ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ what in the feudal sense is dis­hon­or­able in mar­ket re­la­tion­ships, the demo­cracy of the prin­ciple of com­merce con­trib­utes to the con­tinu­ation of what is ut­terly anti-demo­cratic, of eco­nomic in­justice, of hu­man de­grad­a­tion. It oc­curs to no-one, that there might be cer­tain ser­vices which would not be ex­press­ible in ex­change-value. That is the real pre­requis­ite for the tri­umph of that sub­ject­ive reason, which is not even cap­able of think­ing some­thing which is true and ob­lig­ated to it­self, per­ceiv­ing it solely as some­thing which ex­ists for oth­ers, some­thing ex­change­able. If pride was the ideo­logy over there \[i.e. Europe\], here it is de­liv­er­ing to cus­tom­ers. This ap­plies as well to the cre­ations of the ob­ject­ive Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[\]. The im­me­di­ate self-ad­vant­age in­her­ent in the act of ex­change, thus what is sub­ject­ively most lim­ited, pro­hib­its the sub­ject­ive ex­pres­sion. Val­or­iz­ab­il­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Ver­wert­barkeit]{.calibre22}[\], the a pri­ori of pro­duc­tion con­sist­ently ori­ented to the mar­ket, does not per­mit the spon­tan­eous need for such, for the thing it­self, to arise. Even the cul­tural products pro­duced and dis­trib­uted through­out the world with the greatest of ex­pendit­ures, re­peat the ges­tures -- even if only by vir­tue of an opaque ma­chinery -- of trav­el­ing mu­si­cians, who keep an eye peeled on the plate by the pi­ano, while ham­mer­ing out the fa­vor­ite melod­ies of their pat­rons. The budgets of the cul­ture in­dustry run into the bil­lions, but the law of form of their pro­duc­tions is the tip. What is ex­cess­ively blank, hy­gien­ic­ally clean in in­dus­tri­al­ized cul­ture, is the sole rudi­ment of that shame, an ad­jur­at­ory pic­ture, com­par­able to the suits of the highest hotel man­agers, who, in or­der not to look like head waiters, out­class the ar­is­to­crats in el­eg­ance and thereby make them­selves re­cog­niz­able as head waiters.]{.calibre3}

[I.Q.]{.calibre22}[ -- The modes of con­duct ap­pro­pri­ate to the most pro­gress­ive tech­nical state of de­vel­op­ment are not lim­ited to the sec­tors, in which they are ac­tu­ally pro­moted. Thus think­ing sub­mits to the so­cial su­per­vi­sion of its ser­vices not only where it is forced to do so by its oc­cu­pa­tion, but comes to re­sembles such in its en­tire com­plex­ion. Be­cause thought has been well-nigh in­ver­ted into the solu­tion of tasks as­signed to it, what is not as­signed is also dealt with ac­cord­ing to the schema of the task. Thought, hav­ing lost its autonomy, no longer trusts it­self to com­pre­hend some­thing real for its own sake, in free­dom. This it leaves, with re­spect­ful il­lu­sion, to the highest-paid, and makes it­self meas­ur­able for this. It tends to be­have, for its own part, as if it had to un­ceas­ingly por­tray its use­ful­ness. Even where there is no nut­shell to crack, think­ing turns into train­ing \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] for some sort of ex­er­cise or other. It relates to its ob­jects as mere hurdles, as a per­man­ent test of its own be­ing in form. Con­sid­er­a­tions, which would like to be re­spons­ible for the re­la­tion to the ma­ter­ial \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[\] and thereby for them­selves, in­vite the sus­pi­cion that they are vain, over­blown, aso­cial self-sat­is­fac­tion. Just as the neo-pos­it­iv­ists split cog­ni­tion into the scrap-heaps of em­pir­i­cism and lo­gical form­al­ism, the in­tel­lec­tual activ­ity of the types, who re­gard the unity of the sci­ences as writ­ten on their fore­heads, is po­lar­ized in the in­vent­ory of the known and the test sample of the ca­pa­city for thought: to them, every thought turns into a quiz of whether they are in­formed or of their qual­i­fic­a­tions. Some­where the cor­rect an­swers must already be pos­ted. In­stru­ment­al­ism, the latest ver­sion of prag­mat­ism, has long since be­come not merely an af­fair of the ap­plic­a­tion of think­ing, but rather the a pri­ori of its own form. When op­pos­i­tional in­tel­lec­tu­als caught in such a spell wish to ap­proach the con­tent of so­ci­ety dif­fer­ently, they are crippled by the shape of their own con­scious­ness, which is modeled in ad­vance on the needs of this so­ci­ety. While their thought has for­got­ten how to think for it­self, it has sim­ul­tan­eously turned into the ab­so­lute exam-au­thor­ity of it­self. Think­ing means noth­ing other than check­ing at every mo­ment, as to whether one can think. Thus the as­phyxi­at­ing qual­ity of every seem­ingly in­de­pend­ent in­tel­lec­tual pro­duc­tion, the the­or­et­ical ones no less than the artistic ones. The so­cial­iz­a­tion of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[\] holds it, roofed over, en­sorceled, un­der a glass, as long as so­ci­ety is it­self trapped. Where think­ing pre­vi­ously in­tern­al­ized ob­lig­a­tions im­posed from out­side, today it today in­cor­por­ates its in­teg­ra­tion into the all-em­bra­cing ap­par­atus, and goes to pieces, even be­fore its eco­nomic and polit­ical ver­dict can over­take it.]{.calibre3}

[Wish­ful think­ing. ]{.calibre22}[\[In Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] -- In­tel­li­gence is a moral cat­egory. The sep­ar­a­tion of feel­ing and un­der­stand­ing, which makes it pos­sible to say, free and blessed are the knuckle­heads, hy­po­stat­izes the his­tor­ic­ally achieved splin­ter­ing of hu­man be­ings into func­tions. The praise of sim­pli­city \[]{.calibre3}[Ein­falt]{.calibre22}[\] res­on­ates with the anxi­ety that whatever has been sep­ar­ated might re­unite and thus put an end to the mis­chief. "If you have un­der­stand­ing and a heart," goes a couplet by Hölder­lin, "show only one of each / Both con­demn you, if you dis­play them to­gether." \[from Hölder­lin's poem ]{.calibre3}[Good Ad­vice]{.calibre22}[\] The den­ig­ra­tion of re­stric­ted un­der­stand­ing in com­par­ison with in­fin­ite reason which echoes in philo­sophy, a reason which, as in­fin­ite, is at the same time un­dis­cov­er­able by the ul­ti­mately fi­nite sub­ject, echoes in spite of its crit­ical jus­ti­fic­a­tion the old saw: "Be ever true and faith­ful" \[quo­ta­tion from Moz­art song\]. When Hegel demon­strated to reason its stu­pid­ity, he not only brought the isol­ated de­term­in­a­tion of re­flec­tion, the pos­it­iv­ism of every name, to its meas­ure of un­truth, but be­came com­pli­cit in the ban on thought, sever­ing the neg­at­ive labor of the concept, which the method claimed to achieve, and swears by the highest height of spec­u­la­tion like the Prot­est­ant priest, who re­com­men­ded to his flock to re­main one, in­stead of re­ly­ing on their own weak light. Rather, it is up to philo­sophy to seek out the unity between feel­ing and un­der­stand­ing pre­cisely in their con­trast: in the moral unity. In­tel­li­gence, as the power of judg­ment, op­poses in its car­ry­ing out what is already given, by sim­ul­tan­eously ex­press­ing it. The ca­pa­city of judg­ment, which seals it­self off from the drive-im­pulse, does justice to this last pre­cisely by a mo­ment of counter-pres­sure against the so­cial one. The power of judg­ment is meas­ured by the staunch­ness of the ego. Thereby, how­ever, also in that dy­nam­ics of the drives, which is handed over by the di­vi­sion of labor of the soul to the feel­ings. In­stinct, the will to stand fast, is an im­plic­a­tion of the mean­ing of lo­gic. By for­get­ting it­self, show­ing it­self in­cor­rupt­ible, the judging sub­ject wins its vic­tory. By con­trast, just as the nar­row­est circle of hu­man be­ings dumb them­selves down, where their in­terests be­gin, and then turn their re­sent­ment against what they do not wish to un­der­stand, pre­cisely be­cause they could un­der­stand it all too well, so too is the plan­et­ary stu­pid­ity, which pre­vents the con­tem­por­ary world from see­ing the ab­surdity of its own ar­range­ment, the product of the un­sub­lim­ated, un­sub­lated in­terest of the rulers. Short-term and yet ir­res­ist­ible, it hardens it­self into the an­onym­ous schemata of the his­tor­ical tra­ject­ory. This cor­res­ponds to the stu­pid­ity and ob­stin­acy of the in­di­vidual; the in­ca­pa­city, to con­sciously unite the power of bias and bustle. It is reg­u­larly found in con­junc­tion with moral de­fects, a lack of autonomy and re­spons­ib­il­ity, while so much is true in So­cratic ra­tion­al­ism, that a clever per­son, whose thoughts are dir­ec­ted at ob­jects and do not circle form­al­ist­ic­ally around them­selves, can scarcely be con­ceived of as evil. For the mo­tiv­a­tion of evil, blind pre­ju­dice in the con­tin­gency of what is one's own, tends to dis­sip­ate in the me­dium of thought. Scheler's com­ment, that all cog­ni­tion is foun­ded in love, was a lie, be­cause he de­man­ded that love be some­thing im­me­di­ately viewed. But it would be­come the truth, if love pressed for the dis­sol­u­tion of all ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Scheins]{.calibre22}[\] of im­me­di­acy and thereby, to be sure, be­came ir­re­con­cil­able with the ob­ject of cog­ni­tion. Neither the syn­thesis of psychic com­part­ments, ali­en­ated from each other, nor the thera­peutic dis­place­ment of the ra­tio with ir­ra­tional fer­ments, is any help against the split­ting of thought, but rather the self-con­sti­tu­tion of the ele­ment of the wish, which an­ti­thet­ic­ally con­sti­tutes think­ing as think­ing. Only when that ele­ment is com­pletely dis­solved, without any het­ero­nom­ous rem­nant in the ob­jectiv­ity of thought, does it drive to­wards uto­pia.]{.calibre3}

[Re­gres­sions]{.calibre22}[. -- My earli­est memory of Brahms, and cer­tain not only mine, is ]{.calibre3}[Cradle Song]{.calibre22}[. A com­plete mis­un­der­stand­ing of the text: I didn't know that Näglein \[flowers\] was a word for lilacs or in many dis­tricts for pink flowers, but ima­gined the word meant little nail, the nu­mer­ous pins by which the cur­tain around the heav­enly bed, my own, was fastened, so that the child, pro­tec­ted in its dark­ness from every trace of light, could sleep end­lessly long, without fear -- "un­til the cows come home," as they say in Hessen. How dis­tant the blos­soms re­main from the ten­der­ness of such cur­tains. For us, noth­ing stands for un­di­min­ished bright­ness other than the un­con­scious dark; noth­ing for what we once could be, other than the dream, that we had never been born.]{.calibre3}

["Sleep in peace, sleep / close your little eyes so sweet / listen to the rain­fall drip / hear the neigh­bors' doggy yip / Doggy bit the beg­gar man / tore a hole in his pants / past the gate, the beg­gar flees / sleep in peace, sleep." The first line of Taubert's lul­laby is ter­ri­fy­ing. And yet both its fi­nal lines bless sleep with the prom­ise of peace. This is not en­tirely due to bour­geois hard­ness, the com­fort­ing thought, that the in­truder was scared off. The sleepily listen­ing child has already half-for­got­ten the ex­ile of the for­eigner, who looks in Schott's song book like a Jew, and in­tu­its in the verse "past the gate, the beg­gar flees" peace without the misery of oth­ers. So long as there is even a single beg­gar, goes a frag­ment in Ben­jamin, there is mythos; only with the dis­ap­pear­ance of the lat­ter would mythos be re­con­ciled. Would not vi­ol­ence it­self be for­got­ten as in the on­rush­ing wave of the child's sleep? Would not in the end the dis­ap­pear­ance of the beg­gar nev­er­the­less en­tirely com­pensate, for what was done to him and which could not be com­pensated for? Doesn't there lurk in all per­se­cu­tion by hu­man be­ings, who, along with the little dog, in­cite the whole of nature against the weak, the hope that the last trace of per­se­cu­tion would be ex­tirp­ated, which is it­self the share of what is nat­ural? Would not the beg­gar, who is forced out of the gates of civil­iz­a­tion, find refuge in his home­land, which is eman­cip­ated from the bane \[Bann\] of the Earth? "Now rest and let your wor­ries pass, the beg­gar comes home at last." For as long as I can think, I\'ve been happy with the song, "Between moun­tain and deep, deep val­ley": by the two rab­bits who were stuff­ing them­selves with grass, who were shot at by hunters, and upon real­iz­ing they were still alive, ran off. But I only un­der­stood the les­son quite late: reason can en­dure only in des­pair and crisis; it re­quires the ab­surd, in or­der to not be over­come by ob­ject­ive mad­ness. One should act ex­actly like the rab­bits; when the shot rings out, fall fool­ishly to the ground as if dead, col­lect one­self and one's senses, and if one still has any breath, run like blazes. The en­ergy to fear and that for hap­pi­ness are the same, the lim­it­less state of open-minded­ness for ex­per­i­ence, raised to self-sac­ri­fice, in which the one who is over­come can find them­selves again. What would any hap­pi­ness be, which did not meas­ure it­self ac­cord­ing to the im­meas­ur­able sor­row of what is? For the course of the world is deeply un­settled. Who­ever cau­tiously ad­apts to it, par­takes of its mad­ness, while only the ec­cent­ric holds fast and com­mands the ab­surdity to halt. Only the lat­ter may nav­ig­ate the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of calam­ity, the "un­real­ity of des­pair," and in­nerv­ate from this, not merely that one still lives, but that there is still life. The cun­ning of the power­less hares re­deems, along with them­selves, even the hunters, whose guilt they pil­fer. ]{.calibre3}

[Cus­tomer ser­vice]{.calibre22}[. -- The cul­ture in­dustry sanc­ti­mo­ni­ously claims to fol­low its con­sumers and to de­liver what they want. But while it re­flex­ively den­ig­rates every thought of its own autonomy and pro­claims its vic­tims as judges, its veiled high-handed­ness out­bids all the ex­cesses of autonom­ous art. It is not so much that the cul­ture in­dustry ad­apts to the re­ac­tions of its cus­tom­ers, as that it feigns these lat­ter. It re­hearses them, by be­hav­ing as if it it­self was a cus­tomer. One could al­most sus­pect, the en­tire "ad­just­ment" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], which it claims to obey, is ideo­logy; that the more hu­man be­ings try, through ex­ag­ger­ated equal­ity, through the oath of fealty to so­cial power­less­ness, to par­ti­cip­ate in power and to drive out equal­ity, the more they at­tempt to make them­selves re­semble oth­ers and the whole. "The mu­sic listens for the listen­ers," and the film prac­tices on the scale of a trust the despic­able trick of adults, who, when speak­ing down to a child, fall over the gift with the lan­guage which suits only them, and then present the usu­ally du­bi­ous gift with pre­cisely the ex­pres­sion of lip-smack­ing joy, that is sup­posed to be eli­cited. The cul­ture in­dustry is tailored ac­cord­ing to mi­metic re­gres­sion, to the ma­nip­u­la­tion of sup­pressed im­it­a­tion-im­pulses. Therein it avails it­self of the method, of an­ti­cip­at­ing its own im­it­a­tion by its view­ers, and seal­ing the con­sensus that it wishes to es­tab­lish, by mak­ing it ap­pear as if it already ex­is­ted. What makes this all the easier, is that it can count on such a con­sensus in a stable sys­tem and can ritu­ally re­peat it, rather than ac­tu­ally hav­ing to pro­duce it. Its product is by no means a stim­u­lus, but a model for modes of re­ac­tion of nonex­ist­ent stim­uli. Thus the en­thu­si­astic mu­sic titles on the sil­ver screen, the mor­onic chil­dren's speech, the eye-wink­ing folksi­ness; even the close-up of the start calls out "How beau­ti­ful!," as it were. With this pro­ced­ure the cul­tural ma­chine goes so far as to dress down view­ers like the front­ally pho­to­graphed ex­press train in a mo­ment of ten­sion. The ca­dence of every film how­ever is that of the witch, who serves soup to the little ones she wants to en­sor­cel or de­vour, with the hideous mur­mur, "Yummy soup, yummy soup? You\'ll en­joy it, you\'ll en­joy it\..." In art, this kit­chen fire-ma­gic was dis­covered by Wag­ner, whose lin­guistic in­timacies and mu­sical spices are al­ways tast­ing them­selves, and who sim­ul­tan­eously demon­strated the en­tire pro­ced­ure, with the genius' com­pul­sion of con­fes­sion, in the scene of the ]{.calibre3}[Ring]{.calibre22}[, where Mime of­fers Siegfried the poisoned po­tion. Who how­ever is sup­posed to chop off the mon­ster's head, now that its blond locks have lain for a long time un­der the linden tree? \[Unter den Linden: fam­ous boulevard in Ber­lin\]]{.calibre3}

[Grey and grey]{.calibre22}[. -- Not even its bad con­science can help the cul­ture in­dustry. Its Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] is so ob­ject­ive, that it slaps all its sub­jects in the face, and so the lat­ter, agents all, know what the story is and seek to dis­tance them­selves through men­tal re­ser­va­tions from the non­sense which they cre­ate. The ac­know­ledg­ment, that films broad­cast ideo­logy, is it­self a broad­cast ideo­logy. It is dealt with ad­min­is­trat­ively by the ri­gid dis­tinc­tion between syn­thetic day-dreams on the one hand, vehicles of flight from daily life, "es­cape" \[Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]; and well-mean­ing products on the other hand, which pro­mote cor­rect so­cial be­ha­vi­ors, provid­ing in­form­a­tion, "con­vey­ing a mes­sage" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]. The prompt sub­sump­tion un­der "es­cape" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] and "mes­sage" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] ex­presses the un­truth of both types. The mock­ery against "es­cape" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], the stand­ard­ized out­rage against su­per­fi­ci­al­ity, is noth­ing but the pathetic echo of the old-fash­ioned ethos, which de­nounces gambling, be­cause it can­not play along with such in the pre­vail­ing praxis. The es­cape-films are so dread­ful not be­cause they turn their back on an ex­ist­ence squeezed dry, but be­cause they do not do so en­er­get­ic­ally enough, be­cause they are squeezed just as dry, be­cause the sat­is­fac­tions which they pre­tend to give, con­verge with the hu­mi­li­ation of real­ity, with re­nun­ci­ation. The dreams have no dream. Just as the tech­nicolor her­oes don't al­low us to for­get for a second that they are nor­mal hu­man be­ings, typecast prom­in­ent faces and in­vest­ments, what is un­mis­tak­ably re­vealed un­der the thin flut­ter of schem­at­ic­ally pro­duced fantasy is the skel­eton of cinema-on­to­logy, the en­tire pre­scribed hier­archy of val­ues, the canon of what is un­wanted and what is to be im­it­ated. Noth­ing is more prac­tical than "es­cape" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], noth­ing is more wed­ded to bustle: one is kid­napped into the dis­tance only to have it hammered into one's con­scious­ness, that even at a dis­tance, the laws of the em­pir­ical mode of life are un­dis­turbed by em­pir­ical de­vi­ations. The "es­cape" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] is full of "mes­sage" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]. That is how the "mes­sage" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], the op­pos­ite, looks, which wishes to flee from flight. It re­ifies the res­ist­ance against re­ific­a­tion. One need only hear ex­perts talk about how a splen­did work of the sil­ver screen has, next to other mer­its, also a con­sti­tu­tion, in the same tone of voice that a pretty act­ress is de­scribed as even hav­ing "per­son­al­ity" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]. The ex­ec­ut­ive can eas­ily de­cide at the con­fer­ence, that the es­cape-film must be given, next to more ex­pens­ive ad­di­tions, an ideal such as: hu­man be­ings should be noble, help­ful and good. Sep­ar­ated from the im­man­ent lo­gic of the en­tity, from the thing, the ideal turns into some­thing pro­duced on tap, the re­form of ameli­or­able griev­ances, trans­figured char­ity, thereby sim­ul­tan­eously tan­gible and void. They prefer most of all to broad­cast the re­hab­il­it­a­tion of drunks, whose im­pov­er­ished eu­phoria they envy. By rep­res­ent­ing a so­ci­ety hardened in it­self, ac­cord­ing to an­onym­ous laws, as if good will alone were enough to help mat­ters, that so­ci­ety is de­fen­ded even where it is hon­estly at­tacked. What is re­flec­ted is a kind of pop­u­lar front of all proper and right-think­ing people. The prac­tical Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] of the "mes­sage" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], the tan­gible demon­stra­tion of how things can be done bet­ter, al­lies it­self with the sys­tem in the fic­tion, that a total so­cial sub­ject, which does not ex­ist at present, can make everything okay, if one could only as­semble all the pieces and clear up the root of the evil. It is quite pleas­ant, to be able to vouch for one's ef­fi­ciency. "Mes­sage" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] turns into "es­cape" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]: those swept up in clean­ing the house in which they live, for­get the ground on which it was built. What "es­cape" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] would really be, the an­ti­pathy, turned into a pic­ture, against the whole, all the way into what is form­ally con­sti­tuted, could re­coil into a "mes­sage" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], without ex­press­ing it, in­deed pre­cisely through ten­a­cious as­ceti­cism against the sug­ges­tion.]{.calibre3}

[Wolf as grand­mother]{.calibre22}[. -- The strongest ar­gu­ment of the apo­lo­gists for film is the crudest, its massive con­sump­tion. They de­clare the drastic me­dium of the cul­ture in­dustry to be pop­u­lar art. The in­de­pend­ence of norms of the autonom­ous work is sup­posed to dis­charge it from aes­thetic re­spons­ib­il­ity, a re­spons­ib­il­ity whose stand­ards prove to be re­ac­tion­ary in re­la­tion to film, just as in fact all in­ten­tions of the artistic en­no­ble­ment of film have some­thing awry, some­thing badly el­ev­ated, some­thing lack­ing in form -- some­thing of the im­port for the con­nois­seur. The more that film pre­tends to be art, the more fraud­u­lent it be­comes. Its prot­ag­on­ists can point to this and even, as crit­ics of the mean­while kitschy in­ter­i­or­ity, ap­pear av­ant-garde next to its crude ma­ter­ial kitsch. If one grants this as a ground, then they be­come, strengthened by tech­nical ex­per­i­ence and fa­cil­ity with the ma­ter­ial, nearly ir­res­ist­ible. The film is not a mass art, but is merely ma­nip­u­lated for the de­cep­tion of the masses? But the wishes of the masses make them­selves felt in­cess­antly through the mar­ket; its col­lect­ive pro­duc­tion alone would guar­an­tee its col­lect­ive es­sence \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\]; only someone com­pletely out­side of real­ity would pre­sume to see clever ma­nip­u­lat­ors in the pro­du­cers; most are tal­ent­less, cer­tainly, but where the right tal­ents co­in­cide, it can suc­ceed in spite of all the re­stric­tions of the sys­tem. The mass taste which the film obeys, is by no means that of the masses them­selves, but fois­ted on them? But to speak of a dif­fer­ent mass taste than the one they have now, would be fool­ish, and what is called pop­u­lar art, has al­ways re­flec­ted dom­in­a­tion. Ac­cord­ing to such lo­gic, it is only in the com­pet­ent ad­apt­a­tion of pro­duc­tion to given needs, not in con­sid­er­a­tion of a uto­pian audi­ence, that the name­less gen­eral will can take shape. Films are full of ly­ing ste­reo­types? But ste­reo­typ­ing is the es­sence of pop­u­lar art, fairy-tales know the res­cuing prince and the devil just as films have the hero and vil­lain, and even the bar­baric cruelty, which di­vided the world into good and evil, is some­thing film has in com­mon with the greatest fairy-tales, which have the step­mother dance to death in red-hot iron shoes. ]{.calibre3}

[All this is can be countered, only by con­sid­er­a­tion of the fun­da­mental con­cepts pre­sup­posed by the apo­lo­gists. Bad films are not to be charged with in­com­pet­ence: the most gif­ted are re­frac­ted by the bustle, and the fact that the un­gif­ted stream to­wards them, is due to the elect­ive af­fin­ity between lies and swind­lers. The idiocy is ob­ject­ive; im­prove­ments in per­son­nel could not cre­ate a pop­u­lar art. The lat­ter's idea was formed in agrarian re­la­tion­ships or simple com­mod­ity eco­nom­ies. Such re­la­tion­ships and their char­ac­ter of ex­pres­sion are those of lords and serfs, prof­it­eers and dis­ad­vant­aged, but in an im­me­di­ate, not en­tirely ob­jec­ti­fied form. They are to be sure not less fur­rowed by class dif­fer­ences than late in­dus­trial so­ci­ety, but their mem­bers are not yet en­com­passed by the total struc­ture, which re­duces in­di­vidual sub­jects to mere mo­ments, in or­der to unite them, as those who are power­less and isol­ated, into the col­lect­ive. That there are no longer folk does not how­ever mean that, as Ro­man­ti­cism propag­ated, the masses are worse. On the con­trary, what is re­vealed pre­cisely now in the new, rad­ical ali­en­ated form of so­ci­ety is the un­truth of the older one. Even the traits, which the cul­ture in­dustry re­claims as the leg­acy of pop­u­lar art, be­come thereby sus­pect. The film has a ret­ro­act­ive en­ergy: its op­tim­istic hor­ror brings to light what al­ways served in­justice in the fairy-tale, and evokes in the parade of vil­lains the coun­ten­ances of those, which the in­teg­ral so­ci­ety con­demns and whose con­dem­na­tion was ever the dream of so­cial­iz­a­tion. That is why the ex­tinc­tion of in­di­vidual art is no jus­ti­fic­a­tion for one which acts as if it its sub­ject, which re­acts ar­cha­ic­ally, were the nat­ural one, while this last is the syn­dic­ate, al­beit un­con­scious, of a pair of gi­ant firms. If the masses them­selves, as cus­tom­ers, have an in­flu­ence on the film, this re­mains as ab­stract as the ticket stub, which steps into the place of nu­anced ap­plause: the mere choice between yes and no to some­thing offered, strung between the dis­crep­ancy of con­cen­trated power and scattered power­less­ness. Fi­nally, the fact that nu­mer­ous ex­perts, also simple tech­ni­cians, par­ti­cip­ate in the mak­ing of a film, no more guar­an­tees its hu­man­ity than the de­cisions of com­pet­ent sci­entific bod­ies ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ bombs and poison gas. The high-flown talk of film art stands in­deed to be­ne­fit scrib­blers, who wish to get ahead; the con­scious ap­peal to ]{.calibre3}[naïvété]{.calibre22}[, how­ever, to the block-headed­ness of the sub­al­terns, long since per­meated by the thoughts of the mas­ter, will not do. Film, which today clings as un­avoid­ably to hu­man be­ings, as if it was a piece of them­selves, is sim­ul­tan­eously that which is most dis­tant from their hu­man de­term­in­a­tion, which is real­ized from one day to the next, and its apo­lo­get­ics live on the res­ist­ance against think­ing through this an­ti­nomy. That the people who make films are by no means in­triguers, says noth­ing against this. The ob­ject­ive Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] of ma­nip­u­la­tion pre­vails through rules of ex­per­i­ence, es­tim­a­tions of situ­ations, tech­nical cri­teria, eco­nom­ic­ally un­avoid­able cal­cu­la­tions, the en­tire dead­weight of the in­dus­trial ap­par­atus, without even hav­ing to cen­sor it­self, and even those who ques­tioned the masses, would find the ubi­quity of the sys­tem re­flec­ted back at them. The pro­du­cers func­tion as little as sub­jects as their work­ers and buy­ers, but solely as parts of an in­de­pend­ent ma­chinery. The Hegel­ian-sound­ing com­mand­ment, how­ever, that mass art must re­spect the real taste of the masses and not that of neg­at­iv­istic in­tel­lec­tu­als, is usurp­a­tion. The op­pos­i­tion of film, as an all-en­com­passing ideo­logy, to the ob­ject­ive in­terests of hu­man be­ings, its en­tan­gle­ment with the status quo of the profit-sys­tem, its bad con­science and de­cep­tion can be suc­cinctly cog­nized. No ap­peal to a fac­tu­ally ac­cess­ible state of con­scious­ness would have the right of veto against the in­sight, which reaches bey­ond this state of con­scious­ness, by dis­clos­ing its con­tra­dic­tion to it­self and to ob­ject­ive re­la­tion­ships. It is pos­sible, that the Fas­cist pro­fessor was right and that even the folk songs, as they were, lived from the de­graded cul­tural her­it­age of the up­per class. It is not for noth­ing that all pop­u­lar art is crumbly and, like films, not "or­ganic." But between the old in­justice, in whose voice a lament is still aud­ible, even where it trans­fig­ures it­self, and the ali­en­a­tion which up­holds it­self as con­nec­ted­ness, which cun­ningly cre­ates the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of hu­man in­tim­acy with loud­speak­ers and ad­vert­ising psy­cho­logy, there is a dis­tinc­tion sim­ilar to the one between the mother, who soothes the child who is afraid of demons with a fairy-tale in which the good are re­war­ded and the evil are pun­ished, and the cinema product, which drives the justice of each world or­der into the eyes and ears of audi­ences of every land harshly, threat­en­ingly, in or­der to teach them anew, and more thor­oughly, the old fear. The fairy-tale dreams which call so eagerly for the child in the adult, are noth­ing but re­gres­sion, or­gan­ized by total en­light­en­ment, and where they tap the audi­ence on the shoulder most in­tim­ately, they be­tray them most thor­oughly. Im­me­di­acy, the com­munity pro­duced by films, is tan­tamount to the me­di­ation without a re­mainder, which de­grades hu­man be­ings and everything hu­man so com­pletely to things, that their con­trast to things, in­deed even the bane \[Bann\] of re­ific­a­tion it­self, can­not be per­ceived any­more. Film has suc­ceeded in trans­form­ing sub­jects into so­cial func­tions so in­dis­crim­in­ately, that those who are en­tirely in its grasp, un­aware of any con­flicts, en­joy their own de­hu­man­iz­a­tion as hu­man, as the hap­pi­ness of warmth. The total con­text of the cul­ture in­dustry, which leaves noth­ing out, is one with total so­cial de­lu­sion. That is why it so eas­ily dis­patches counter-ar­gu­ments. ]{.calibre3}

[Ex­pens­ive re­pro­duc­tion]{.calibre22}[. \[Piper­druck\] -- So­ci­ety is in­teg­ral, be­fore it ever be­comes ruled as to­tal­it­arian. Its or­gan­iz­a­tion en­com­passes even those who feud against it, and nor­mal­izes their con­scious­ness. Even in­tel­lec­tu­als who have all the polit­ical ar­gu­ments against bour­geois ideo­logy handy, are sub­jec­ted to a pro­cess of stand­ard­iz­a­tion which, whether in crassly con­trast­ing con­tent or through the read­i­ness on their part to be com­fort­able, brings them closer to the pre­vail­ing Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], such that their stand­point ob­ject­ively be­comes al­ways more ar­bit­rary, de­pend­ent on flimsy pref­er­ences or their es­tim­a­tion of their own chances. What ap­pears to them as sub­ject­ively rad­ical, ob­ject­ively be­longs through and through to the com­part­ment of a schema, re­served for them and their kind, so that rad­ic­al­ism is de­graded to ab­stract prestige, the le­git­im­a­tion of those who know what today's in­tel­lec­tu­als should be for and against. The good things, for which they opt, have long since been ac­know­ledged, their num­bers ac­cord­ingly lim­ited, as fixed in the value-hier­archy as those in the stu­dent fra­tern­it­ies. While they de­nounce of­fi­cial kitsch, their sens­ib­il­ity is de­pend­ent, like obed­i­ent chil­dren, on nour­ish­ment already sought out in ad­vance, on the cliches of hos­til­ity to cliches. The dwell­ings of young bo­hemi­ans re­semble their spir­itual house­hold. On the wall, de­cept­ively ori­ginal color prints of fam­ous artists, such as Van Gogh's ]{.calibre3}[Sun­flowers]{.calibre22}[ or the ]{.calibre3}[Café at Arles]{.calibre22}[, on the book­shelf de­riv­at­ive works on so­cial­ism and psy­cho­ana­lysis and a little sex-re­search for the un­in­hib­ited with in­hib­i­tions. In ad­di­tion, the Ran­dom House edi­tion of Proust -- Scott Mon­crieff's trans­la­tion de­served a bet­ter fate -- ex­clus­iv­ity at re­duced prices, whose ex­ter­ior alone, the com­pact-eco­nomic form of the om­ni­bus, is a mock­ery of the au­thor, whose every sen­tence knocks a re­ceived opin­ion out of ac­tion, while he now plays, as a prize-win­ning ho­mo­sexual, the same role with youth as books on an­im­als of the forest and the North Pole ex­ped­i­tion in the Ger­man home. Also, the re­cord player with the Lin­coln can­tata of a brave soul, which deals es­sen­tially with rail­road sta­tions, next to the ob­lig­at­ory eye-catch­ing folk­lore from Ok­lahoma and a pair of brassy jazz re­cords, which make one feel sim­ul­tan­eously col­lect­ive, bold and com­fort­able. Every judg­ment is ap­proved by friends, they know all the ar­gu­ments in ad­vance. That all cul­tural products, even the non-con­form­ist ones, are in­cor­por­ated into the mech­an­ism of dis­tri­bu­tion of large-scale cap­ital, that in the most de­veloped lands a cre­ation which does not bear the im­prim­atur of mass pro­duc­tion can scarcely reach any read­ers, ob­serv­ers, or listen­ers, re­fuses the ma­ter­ial in ad­vance for the de­vi­at­ing long­ing. Even Kafka is turned into a piece of in­vent­ory in the ren­ted apart­ment. In­tel­lec­tu­als them­selves are already so firmly es­tab­lished, in their isol­ated spheres, in what is con­firmed, that they can no longer de­sire any­thing which is not served to them un­der the brand of "high­brow" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]. Their sole am­bi­tion con­sists of find­ing their way in the ac­cep­ted canon, of say­ing the right thing. The out­sider status of the ini­ti­ates is an il­lu­sion and mere wait­ing-time. It would be giv­ing them too much credit to call them reneg­ades; they wear over­large horn-rimmed glasses on their me­diocre faces, solely to bet­ter pass them­selves off as "bril­liant" to them­selves and to oth­ers in the gen­eral com­pet­i­tion. They are already ex­actly like them. The sub­ject­ive pre­con­di­tion of op­pos­i­tion, the non-nor­mal­ized judg­ment, goes ex­tinct, while its trap­pings con­tinue to be car­ried out as a group ritual. Stalin need only clear his throat, and they throw Kafka and Van Gogh on the trash-heap. ]{.calibre3}

[Con­tri­bu­tion to in­tel­lec­tual his­tory]{.calibre22}[. -- In the back of my copy of Za­rath­rus­tra, dated 1910, there are pub­lisher's no­tices. They are all tailored to that clan of Ni­et­z­sche read­ers, as ima­gined by Al­fred Körner in Leipzig, someone who ought to know. "]{.calibre3}[Ideal Life-goals]{.calibre22}[ by Adal­bert Svoboda. Svoboda has ig­nited a brightly shin­ing beacon in his works, which cast light on all prob­lems of the in­vest­ig­at­ive Spirit of hu­man be­ings \[]{.calibre3}[Menschengeist]{.calibre22}[\] and re­veal be­fore our eyes the true ideals of reason, art and cul­ture. This mag­ni­fi­cently con­ceived and splen­didly real­ized book is grip­ping from be­gin­ning to end, en­chant­ing, stim­u­lat­ing, in­struct­ive and has the same ef­fect on all truly free Spir­its \[Geister\] as a nerve-steel­ing bath and fresh moun­tain air." Signed: Hu­man­ity, and al­most as re­com­mend­able as David Friedrich Strauss. "]{.calibre3}[On Za­rath­rus­tra]{.calibre22}[ by Max Ernst. There are two Ni­et­z­sches. One is the world-fam­ous fash­ion­able philo­sopher, the dazzling poet and phe­nom­en­ally gif­ted mas­ter of style, who is now the talk of all the world, from whose works a few mis­un­der­stood slo­gans have be­come the in­tel­lec­tual bag­gage of the edu­cated. The other Ni­et­z­sche is the un­fathom­able, in­ex­haust­ible thinker and psy­cho­lo­gist, the great dis­cerner of hu­man be­ings and valuer of life of un­sur­pass­able spir­itual en­ergy and power of thought, to who the most dis­tant fu­ture be­longs. To bring this other Ni­et­z­sche to the most ima­gin­at­ive and ser­i­ous-minded of con­tem­por­ary hu­man be­ings is the in­tent of the fol­low­ing two es­says con­tained in this short book." In that case I would still prefer the former. The other goes: "]{.calibre3}[A Philo­sopher and a Noble Hu­man Be­ing, a Con­tri­bu­tion to the Char­ac­ter­ist­ics of Friedrich Ni­et­z­sche]{.calibre22}[, by Meta von Salis-Marschlins. The book grabs out at­ten­tion by the faith­ful re­pro­duc­tion of all the sen­sa­tions which Ni­et­z­sche's per­son­al­ity evoked in the self-con­scious soul of a wo­man." Don't for­get the whip, in­struc­ted Za­rath­rus­tra. In­stead of this, is offered: "]{.calibre3}[The Philo­sophy of Joy]{.calibre22}[ by Max Zerbst. Dr. Max Zerbst starts out from Ni­et­z­sche, but strives to over­come a cer­tain one-sided­ness in Ni­et­z­sche\... The au­thor is not given to cool ab­strac­tions, it is rather a hymn, a philo­soph­ical hymn to joy, which he de­liv­ers in spades." Like a stu­dent spree. Only no one-sided­ness. Bet­ter to run straight to the heaven of the athe­ists: "]{.calibre3}[The Four Gos­pels]{.calibre22}[, Ger­man, with in­tro­duc­tion and com­ment­ary by Dr. Hein­rich Schmidt.

The choice is dif­fi­cult, but one can take com­fort from the fact that both elites will be as agree­able as the syn­op­ti­cists: "]{.calibre3}[The Gos­pel of Mod­ern Hu­man­ity (A Syn­thesis: Ni­et­z­sche and Christ)]{.calibre22}[ by Carl Mar­tin.

And mark well: this 'mod­ern', en­tirely new hu­man be­ing cre­ates for it­self and us the most re­viv­i­fy­ing po­tion from an age-old spring: that other mes­sage of re­demp­tion, whose purest sounds res­on­ate in the Ser­mon on the Mount\...

The mir­acle passed away nearly forty years ago, plus twenty more or so, since the genius in Ni­et­z­sche jus­ti­fi­ably de­cided to break off com­mu­nic­a­tion with the world. It didn't help -- ex­hil­ar­ated, un­be­liev­ing priests and ex­po­nents of that or­gan­ized eth­ical cul­ture, which later drove formerly well-to-do ladies to emig­rate and get by as wait­resses in New York, have thrived on the posthum­ous leg­acy of someone who once wor­ried whether someone was listen­ing to him sing "a secret bar­car­ole." Even then, the hope of leav­ing be­hind a mes­sage in a bottle amidst the rising tide of bar­bar­ism was a friendly vis­ion: the des­per­ate let­ters have been left in the mud of the age-old spring, and have been re­worked by a band of noble-minded people and other scoun­drels to highly artistic but low-priced wall dec­or­a­tions. Only since then has the pro­gress of com­mu­nic­a­tion truly got­ten into gear. Who are we to cast as­per­sion on the freest spir­its \[]{.calibre3}[Geister]{.calibre22}[\] of them all, whose trust­wor­thi­ness pos­sibly even out­bids those of their con­tem­por­ar­ies, if they no longer write for an ima­gin­ary pos­ter­ity, but solely for the dead God?]{.calibre3}

[134]{.calibre26}

[Ju­venal's er­ror]{.calibre22}[. -- It's dif­fi­cult to write satire. It is not merely be­cause of a con­di­tion, which needs the lat­ter more than ever, which mocks all mock­ery. The means of irony have ended up in con­tra­dic­tion with the truth. Irony con­victs the ob­ject, by tak­ing it for what it claims to be, and without judg­ment, by block­ing out, as it were, the re­flect­ing sub­ject, meas­ur­ing it by its be­ing-in-it­self. It points out the neg­at­ive by con­front­ing the pos­it­ive with its own claim to pos­it­iv­ity. It sub­lates it­self, as soon as it adds the in­ter­pret­ing word. It thus pre­sup­poses the idea of what is self-evid­ent, ori­gin­ally of so­cial res­on­ance. Only where a com­pel­ling con­sensus of sub­jects is as­sumed, is sub­ject­ive re­flec­tion, the ful­fill­ment of the con­cep­tual act, su­per­flu­ous. Those who have laughter on their side, don't need proof. His­tor­ic­ally, over the mil­len­nia, all the way to the age of Voltaire, satire has been happy to con­sort with those who are stronger and could be re­lied upon, with au­thor­ity. Typ­ic­ally it agit­ated for older strata, threatened by the newer stages of the en­light­en­ment, which sought to sup­port their tra­di­tion­al­ism with en­lightened means: its im­me­morial ob­ject was the de­cline of mor­als \[]{.calibre3}[Sit­ten]{.calibre22}[\]. That is why what once flashed like a rapier, ap­pears to those born to later gen­er­a­tions like a thick truncheon. The double-tongued spir­itu­al­iz­a­tion of the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Er­schein­ung]{.calibre22}[\] al­ways wishes to show the sat­ir­ist as amus­ing, as the height of pro­gress; the met­ric how­ever is that which is en­dangered by pro­gress, which re­mains nev­er­the­less so widely dis­sem­in­ated as a valid ideo­logy, that the phe­nomenon singled out for de­nun­ci­ation is dis­missed, without even be­ing gran­ted a fair trial. The com­ed­ies of Ar­is­to­phanes, in which ob­scene tales are sup­posed to ex­pose for­nic­a­tion, func­tioned as the mod­ern­istic]{.calibre3}[ laud­a­tio tem­poris acti ]{.calibre22}[\[Latin: praise for times past\] for the rabble, which it de­famed. With the vic­tory of the bour­geois class in the Chris­tian era, the func­tion of irony loosened up. It has at times run over to the side of the op­pressed, es­pe­cially where these lat­ter were in truth no longer any­thing of the sort. Ad­mit­tedly, as some­thing im­prisoned in its own form, it has an au­thor­it­arian leg­acy, which never totally di­vested it­self of an un­protest­ing nas­ti­ness. Only with the de­cline of the bour­geoisie did it sub­lim­ate it­self into the ap­peal of an idea of hu­man­ity, which no longer per­mit­ted any re­con­cili­ation with the ex­ist­ent and its con­scious­ness. But even to these ideas, self-evid­ence was what coun­ted: no doubt in the ob­ject­ive-im­me­di­ate evid­ence arose; no wit­ti­cism of Karl Kraus hes­it­ates to de­cide who is re­spons­ible and who is a scoun­drel, what is Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] and what is stu­pid­ity, what is lan­guage and what is a news­pa­per. The vehe­mence \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­walt]{.calibre22}[: vi­ol­ence, power\] of his say­ings is due to his quick-wit­ted­ness. Just as they stop at no ques­tion, in the light­ning-quick con­scious­ness of the mat­ter-at-hand \[]{.calibre3}[Sachver­halts]{.calibre22}[\], so too do they leave no ques­tion open. The more em­phat­ic­ally how­ever the prose of Kraus pos­its its hu­man­ism as an in­vari­ant, the more it takes on res­tor­at­ive qual­it­ies. It con­demns cor­rup­tion and dec­ad­ence, the liter­ati and the Fu­tur­ists, without hav­ing any­thing to com­mend it­self over the zealots of the nat­ural con­di­tion other than the cog­ni­tion of their aw­ful­ness. That in the end the in­transigence against Hitler showed it­self to be yield­ing in the case of Schuschnigg, does not at­test to a lack of cour­age, but the an­ti­nomy of satire. This lat­ter needs some­thing to hold on to, and he, who called him­self the grouch \[]{.calibre3}[Nör­gler]{.calibre22}[\], bent to its pos­it­iv­ity. Even the de­nun­ci­ation of Schmock \[ste­reo­typ­ical hack journ­al­ist\] con­tains, be­side its truth, its crit­ical ele­ment, some­thing of the "com­mon sense" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], which can­not stand the fact that someone talks in such windy terms. The hatred of those who would like to seem more than what they are, holds them fast with the facts of their con­sti­tu­tion. The in­cor­rupt­ib­il­ity ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ what is ar­ti­fi­cial, for the sim­ul­tan­eously un­re­deemed and com­mer­cially ori­ented pre­ten­sion of the Spirit \[Geistes\], un­masks those who failed to meas­ure up to what stands be­fore their eyes as some­thing el­ev­ated. This el­ev­a­tion is power and suc­cess and stands re­vealed, through the botched iden­ti­fic­a­tion, as it­self a lie. But the ]{.calibre3}[faiseur ]{.calibre22}[\[French: mir­acle-worker\] al­ways em­bod­ies at the same time uto­pia: even false jew­els ra­di­ate with a power­less child­hood dream, and this lat­ter is con­demned, be­cause it failed, ad­du­cing it­self, as it were, be­fore the forum of suc­cess. All satire is blind to the forces, which are re­leased dur­ing dis­as­sembly \[]{.calibre3}[Zer­fall]{.calibre22}[: dis­in­teg­ra­tion\]. That is why ter­minal de­cline has ab­sorbed the powers of satire. The scorn of the lead­ers of the Third Reich for emigres and lib­eral state of­fi­cials was the latest ver­sion of this, a scorn whose power con­sisted solely in muscle-flex­ing. The im­possib­il­ity of satire today is not to be blamed, as sen­ti­ment­al­ity would have it, on the re­lativ­ism of val­ues, on the ab­sence of bind­ing norms. Rather, con­sensus it­self, the formal a pri­ori of irony, has turned into the con­tent-based uni­ver­sal con­sensus. As such, it would be the sole worthy ob­ject of irony and sim­ul­tan­eously pulls the rug from un­der­neath it. Its me­dium, the dif­fer­ence between ideo­logy and truth, has van­ished. The former is resigned to the con­firm­a­tion of real­ity through its mere du­plic­a­tion. Irony once ex­pressed: this is what it claims to be, but that is what it is; today how­ever the world al­leges that things are just so, even in the rad­ical lie, and that such a simple find­ing co­in­cides with what is good. There is no crack in the sheer cliff of the ex­ist­ent, to which the grasp of the iron­ist may cling. Those who fall are re­galed by the hellish laughter of the treach­er­ous ob­ject, which dis­em­powers them. The ges­ture of the non-con­cep­tual "that's that" is ex­actly the one which the world turns against each of its vic­tims, and the tran­scend­ental con­sensus, which dwells in irony, be­comes ludicrous be­fore the real con­sensus of those which it should at­tack. Against the blood-drenched ser­i­ous­ness of the total so­ci­ety, which has ab­sorbed its counter-au­thor­ity as the help­less ob­jec­tion which irony formerly struck down, there stands solely blood-drenched ser­i­ous­ness, the un­der­stood truth.]{.calibre3}

[Ex­hib­i­tion­ist]{.calibre22}[. \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\]- Artists do not sub­lim­ate. It is a psy­cho­ana­lytic il­lu­sion to think that they neither sat­isfy their de­sires nor repress them, but trans­form them into so­cially ac­cept­able achieve­ments, into their en­tit­ies \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­bilde]{.calibre22}[\]; in­cid­ent­ally, le­git­im­ate works of art are today without ex­cep­tion so­cially un­ac­cept­able. On the con­trary, artists dis­play vi­ol­ent, free-float­ing in­stincts, which sim­ul­tan­eously col­lide with real­ity and are marked by neur­osis. Even the petty bour­geois ste­reo­type of the dram­at­ist or vi­ol­in­ist as a syn­thesis of nerve-bundles and heart-break­ing is closer to the mark than the no less petty bour­geois drive-eco­nomy, ac­cord­ing to which the Sunday's chil­dren of re­nun­ci­ation are let loose in sym­phon­ies and nov­els. Their part is rather a hys­ter­ic­ally ex­ag­ger­ated lack of in­hib­i­tion ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ all hu­manly con­ceiv­able fears; a nar­ciss­ism driven to the bor­ders of para­noia. Against what is sub­lim­ated, they have idio­syn­crasies. They are ir­re­con­cil­able to the aes­thetes, in­dif­fer­ent to cul­tiv­ated mi­lieus, and they re­cog­nize in the taste­ful mode of life the in­ferior re­ac­tion-form­a­tion to­wards the propensity for what is in­ferior, as surely as the psy­cho­lo­gists who mis­un­der­stand them. They have been at­trac­ted, every­where from the let­ters of Moz­art to his young Augs­burg cousin to the word-jokes of the em­bittered tu­tor, to what is off-color, fool­ish, im­proper. They do not fit into Freu­dian the­ory, be­cause it lacks an ad­equate concept of ex­pres­sion, in spite of all its in­sight into the func­tion­ing of sym­bol­ism of dreams and neur­oses. It is cer­tainly il­lu­min­at­ing, that an un­censored drive-im­pulse, once ex­pressed, can­not be called repressed, even when it no longer wishes to de­mand a goal which it does not find. On the other hand, the ana­lytic dis­tinc­tion between lo­co­motor -- "real" -- and hal­lu­cin­at­ory sat­is­fac­tion points in the dir­ec­tion of the dif­fer­ence of sat­is­fac­tion and un­dis­tor­ted ex­pres­sion. But ex­pres­sion is not hal­lu­cin­a­tion. It is ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\], meas­ured by the real­ity-prin­ciple, and would like to by­pass this lat­ter. What is sub­ject­ive never seeks, how­ever, to sub­sti­tute it­self through the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] in de­lusive fash­ion, as through a symp­tom, in place of real­ity. Ex­pres­sion neg­ates the real­ity, by hold­ing up to it, what does not re­semble it, but it does not deny it; it looks at the con­flict straight in the eye -- the con­flict which oth­er­wise res­ults in the blind symp­tom. What the ex­pres­sion has in com­mon with re­pres­sion, is that the im­pulse finds it­self blocked by real­ity. That im­pulse, and the en­tire con­text of ex­per­i­ence which be­longs to it, is denied im­me­di­ate com­mu­nic­a­tion with the ob­ject. As ex­pres­sion it comes to the un­fals­i­fied phe­nomenon \[]{.calibre3}[Er­schein­ung]{.calibre22}[\] of it­self and thereby of res­ist­ance, in sen­su­ous im­it­a­tion. It is so strong, that it ex­per­i­ences its modi­fic­a­tion to a mere pic­ture, the price of sur­vival, without be­ing mu­til­ated on its way out­side. In­stead of set­ting the goal of its own sub­ject­ive-cen­sor­ing "pro­cessing," it sets some­thing ob­ject­ive: its po­lem­ical rev­el­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Of­fen­bar­ung]{.calibre22}[\]. This dis­tin­guishes it from sub­lim­a­tion: every suc­cess­ful ex­pres­sion of the sub­ject, one might say, is a small vic­tory over the play of forces of its own psy­cho­logy. The pathos of art stems from the fact that pre­cisely by with­draw­ing into the ima­gin­a­tion, it gives the he­ge­mony of real­ity what is its due, and nev­er­the­less does not resign it­self to ad­apt­a­tion, does not per­petu­ate the vi­ol­ence of what is ex­tern­al­ized in the de­form­a­tion of what is in­tern­al­ized. For that reason, those who achieve this must without ex­cep­tion pay dearly as in­di­vidu­als, be­cause they are left help­lessly be­hind their own ex­pres­sion, which out­paces their psy­cho­logy. Thereby how­ever they awaken, no less than their products, doubts in the rank­ing of works of art un­der cul­tural achieve­ments ]{.calibre3}[ex defini­tione]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: by defin­i­tion\]. No work of art can, in the so­cial or­gan­iz­a­tion, evade its mem­ber­ship in cul­ture, but none, which is more than arts-and-crafts, ex­ists which does not turn to cul­ture with a dis­missive ges­ture: that it be­came a work of art. Art is as hos­tile to art as artists. In the re­nun­ci­ation of the drive-goal it keeps faith with this drive-goal, un­mask­ing what is so­cially de­sir­able, which Freud na­ively glor­i­fied as sub­lim­a­tion, which in all like­li­hood does not ex­ist.]{.calibre3}

[Small pains, great songs]{.calibre22}[. -- Con­tem­por­ary mass cul­ture is his­tor­ic­ally ne­ces­sary not merely as the con­sequence of the em­brace of the en­tire life by mon­ster en­ter­prises, but as the con­sequence of what today seems most ut­terly op­posed to the pre­vail­ing stand­ard­iz­a­tion of con­scious­ness, aes­thetic sub­jec­ti­fic­a­tion. In­deed the more that artists went to­wards the in­ner, the more they learned to re­nounce the in­fant­ile fun of im­it­at­ing of what is ex­ternal. But at the same time, they learned, by vir­tue of re­flect­ing on the soul, to con­trol them­selves more and more. The pro­gress of its tech­nics, which con­stantly brought greater free­dom and in­de­pend­ence from what is het­ero­gen­ous, res­ul­ted in a kind of re­ific­a­tion, the tech­ni­fic­a­tion of in­ward­ness as such. The greater the vir­tu­os­ity by which artists ex­press them­selves, the less must they "be" what they ex­press, and the more what is to be ex­pressed, in­deed the con­tent of sub­jectiv­ity it­self, be­comes a mere func­tion of the pro­duc­tion pro­cess. Ni­et­z­sche sensed this, when he ac­cused Wag­ner, the tamer of ex­pres­sion, of hy­po­crisy, without re­cog­niz­ing that it was not a ques­tion of psy­cho­logy, but of a his­tor­ical tend­ency. The trans­form­a­tion of ex­press­ive con­tent from an un­guided im­pulse into a ma­ter­ial for ma­nip­u­la­tion makes it how­ever sim­ul­tan­eously tan­gible, present­able, sal­able. The lyric sub­jec­ti­fic­a­tion in Heine, for ex­ample, does not stand in a simple con­tra­dic­tion to his com­mer­cial traits, rather what is sal­able is it­self a sub­jectiv­ity ad­min­istered by sub­jectiv­ity. The vir­tu­oso us­age of the "scale," which has defined artists since the 19th cen­tury, crosses over out of its own drive-en­ergy into journ­al­ism, spec­tacle, and cal­cu­la­tion, not primar­ily through be­trayal. The law of move­ment of art, which amounts to the con­trol and thereby the ob­jec­ti­fic­a­tion of the sub­ject by it­self, means its down­fall: the hos­til­ity to art of film, which ad­min­is­trat­ively looks over all ma­ter­i­als and emo­tions, in or­der to de­liver them to the cus­tomer, the second ex­ter­i­or­ity, ori­gin­ates in art as the in­creas­ing dom­in­a­tion over in­ner nature. The oft-cited play-act­ing of the mod­ern artists, how­ever, their ex­hib­i­tion­ism, is the ges­ture, through which they put them­selves as goods on the mar­ket. ]{.calibre3}

[Who is who]{.calibre22}[. \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] -- The self-flat­ter­ing con­vic­tion of the na­iv­ety and pur­ity of artists or pro­fess­ors lives on in its in­clin­a­tion, to ex­plain away dif­fi­culties by the cun­ning in­ter­ested­ness, the prac­tic­ally cal­cu­lat­ing Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] of the counter-parties. But just as every con­struc­tion, in which one is jus­ti­fied and the world is un­jus­ti­fied, every in­sist­ence on one's own title, tends to jus­tify the world in one­self, so too do things stand with the an­ti­thesis of pure will and sly­ness. The in­tel­lec­tual out­sider, who knows what to ex­pect, be­haves re­flect­ively today, steered by a thou­sand polit­ical tac­tical con­sid­er­a­tions, cau­tious and sus­pi­cious. The ones who un­der­stand each other, how­ever, whose realm has long since con­verged across party lines on the way to liv­ing-space \[Lebens­raum: no­tori­ous term of Nazi pro­pa­ganda\], no longer con­sider the cal­cu­la­tions ne­ces­sary, which they were once cap­able of. They are so re­li­ably com­mit­ted to the rules of reason, their state of in­terests have sed­i­men­ted them­selves so trans­par­ently into their thought, that they have once again be­come in­noc­u­ous. If one in­vest­ig­ates their shad­owy plans, their judg­ments are meta­phys­ic­ally true, be­cause they are re­lated to the gloomy course of the world, but psy­cho­lo­gic­ally false: they end up in the ob­ject­ively in­creas­ing per­se­cu­tion-mania. Those who com­mit be­trayal and iniquity ac­cord­ing to their func­tion and sell them­selves and their friends to power, re­quire no cun­ning or ul­terior mo­tiv­a­tion for this, no plan­ning in­sti­tu­tion of the ego, but con­versely need only rely on their re­ac­tions and the un­think­ing sat­is­fac­tion of the de­mands of the mo­ment, in or­der to eas­ily ful­fill, what oth­ers could achieve solely through tor­tu­ously com­plex mach­in­a­tions. They in­spire trust, by pro­claim­ing it. They watch to see how things fall out for them, live hand to mouth, and re­com­mend them­selves as sim­ul­tan­eously un­e­go­istic and as sub­scribers to a con­di­tion, which en­sures that they will lack for noth­ing. Be­cause all of them solely pur­sue their par­tic­u­lar in­terest, without con­flict, this in­terest ap­pears once more as gen­eral and dis­in­ter­ested, as it were. Their ges­tures are open, spon­tan­eous, dis­arm­ing. They are nice and their crit­ics are evil. Be­cause they are not even left with the in­de­pend­ence of ac­tion, which would op­pose the in­terest, they de­pend on the good will of oth­ers and are them­selves of good will. The ab­stract in­terest, as some­thing en­tirely me­di­ated, cre­ates a second im­me­di­acy, while those who are not yet com­pletely en­com­passed are un­nat­ur­ally com­prom­ised. In or­der to not be ground be­neath the wheel, these lat­ter must thor­oughly out­bid the world in worl­di­ness and are eas­ily con­victed of clumsy over­com­pens­a­tion. Sus­pi­cion, lust for power, lack of ca­maraderie, fals­ity, van­ity and lack of ser­i­ous­ness are what they are com­puls­ively re­proached for. So­cial en­chant­ment un­avoid­ably turns those who do not play along into self-seek­ing types, while those without a self, who live ac­cord­ing the real­ity prin­ciple, are called self­less.]{.calibre3}

What is not com­pre­hens­ible, from which no-one gets any­thing, turns from an out­ra­ging crime into mere fool­ish­ness, de­serving of pity. They dis­place the tempta­tion along with the spike. That someone is sup­posed to be given some­thing, by all ap­pear­ances the pos­tu­late of sub­stan­ti­al­ity and full­ness, cuts off these lat­ter and im­pov­er­ishes the giv­ing. Therein how­ever the re­la­tion­ship of hu­man be­ings comes to re­semble the aes­thetic one. The re­proach that someone gives noth­ing, is ex­ec­rable. If the re­la­tion is sterile, then one should dis­solve it. Those how­ever who hold fast to it and nev­er­the­less com­plain, al­ways lack the or­gan of sen­sa­tion: ima­gin­a­tion. Both must give some­thing, hap­pi­ness as pre­cisely what is not ex­change­able, what can­not be com­plained about, but such giv­ing is in­sep­ar­able from tak­ing. It is all over, if the other is no longer reach­able by what one finds for them. There is no love, that would not be an echo. In myths, the guar­antor of mercy was the ac­cept­ance of sac­ri­fice; love, how­ever, the after-im­age of the sac­ri­fi­cial act, pleads for the sake of this ac­cept­ance, if it is not to feel it­self to be un­der a curse. The de­cline of gift-giv­ing today goes hand in hand with the harden­ing against tak­ing. It is tan­tamount how­ever to that denial of hap­pi­ness, which alone per­mits hu­man be­ings to hold fast to their man­ner of hap­pi­ness. The wall would be breached, where they re­ceived from oth­ers, what they them­selves must re­ject with a sour grim­ace. That how­ever is dif­fi­cult for them due to the ex­er­tion which tak­ing re­quires of them. Isol­ated in tech­nics, they trans­fer the hatred of the su­per­flu­ous ex­er­tion of their ex­ist­ence onto the en­ergy ex­pendit­ure, which pleas­ure re­quires as a mo­ment of its be­ing \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\] all the way into its sub­lim­a­tions. In spite of count­less small mo­ments of re­lief, their praxis re­mains an ab­surd toil; the squan­der­ing of en­ergy in hap­pi­ness, how­ever, the lat­ter's secret, they do not tol­er­ate. That is why things must go ac­cord­ing to the Eng­lish ex­pres­sion, "re­lax and take it easy" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], which comes from the lan­guage of nurses, not the one of ex­uber­ance. Hap­pi­ness is out­moded: un­eco­nomic. For its idea, sexual uni­fic­a­tion, is the op­pos­ite of be­ing at loose ends, namely ec­static ten­sion, just as that of all sub­jug­ated labor is dis­astrous ten­sion.]{.calibre3}

[Con­secu­tio tem­porum.]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: se­quence of tenses\] -- When my first com­pos­i­tion in­structor tried to drive the atonal non­sense out of me and failed to per­suade me through tales of the erotic scan­dals of the atonal com­posers, he fell back on try­ing to pin me down, where he thought my weak­ness lay, in the wish to be up-to-date. The ul­tra-mod­ern, so ran his ar­gu­ment, was already no longer mod­ern, the stim­u­lus I sought had already faded away, the fig­ures of ex­pres­sion, which ex­cited me, be­longed to an out­moded sen­ti­ment­al­ity, and the new youth had, as he liked to call it, more red blood cells in them. His own pieces, where ori­ent­al­ist themes were reg­u­larly ex­ten­ded through the chro­matic scale, proved such hy­per-subtle con­sid­er­a­tions to be the man­euv­er­ing of a con­cert dir­ector with a bad con­science. But I was soon to dis­cover, that the fash­ion which he up­held against my mod­ern­ity, did in fact re­semble, in the Ur-home­land of the great salons, what he had cooked up in the provinces. Neo­clas­si­cism, that type of re­ac­tion which does not ac­know­ledge it­self to be such, but goes so far as to por­tray the re­ac­tion­ary mo­ment as ad­vanced, was the lead­ing in­dic­ator of a massive tend­ency, which un­der fas­cism and in mass-cul­ture quickly learned to deal with the tender con­sid­er­a­tions of the ar­tistes, who were al­ways hy­per­sens­it­ive any­way, and to unite the spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] of Courths-Mahler with that of tech­nical pro­gress. What is mod­ern has truly be­come un­mod­ern. Mod­ern­ity is a qual­it­at­ive cat­egory, not a chro­no­lo­gical one.

Nev­er­the­less the smug banal­ity ex­presses a dread­ful truth: that in the wake of the train of the en­tire so­ci­ety, which would like to dra­goon all ex­pres­sions into its or­gan­iz­a­tion, what re­mains be­hind is what op­poses the wave of the fu­ture, as the wife of Lind­bergh called it -- the crit­ical con­struc­tion of es­sence \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\].

All nu­ances are so thor­oughly at­tacked and in­ver­ted into "fla­vor" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], that even ad­vanced lit­er­ary sub­tleties re­call de­graded words like gleam­ing, thought­ful, snug, aro­matic. The in­sti­tu­tions against kitsch be­come kitschy, artsy-craftsy, with an over­tone of some­thing idi­ot­ic­ally con­sol­ing from the world of wo­men, whose soul­ful­ness, re­plete with flutes and folk-cos­tumes, be­came stand­ard is­sue in Ger­many. In the ob­lig­at­ory level of junk, with which hap­pily sur­viv­ing in­tel­lec­tu­als ap­ply to the va­cant posts of cul­ture, what yes­ter­day still styl­ized it­self as con­sciously lin­guistic and hos­tile to con­ven­tion reads today like Old Frank­ish fop­pery. Ger­man cul­ture seems to be faced with the al­tern­at­ive of a dread­ful second Bie­der­meier or pa­per-ad­min­is­trat­ive banal­ity. The sim­pli­fic­a­tion, how­ever, which is sug­ges­ted not merely by mar­ket in­terest, but from ex­cel­lent polit­ical motives and fi­nally from the his­tor­ical con­scious­ness of lan­guage it­self, does not so much over­come the nu­ance, as tyr­an­nic­ally pro­mote its de­cay. It of­fers the sac­ri­fice to the om­ni­po­tence of so­ci­ety. But this lat­ter is, pre­cisely for the sake of its om­ni­po­tence, as in­com­men­sur­able with the sub­ject of cog­ni­tion and for­eign as it was in more in­noc­u­ous times, when it avoided daily lan­guage. That hu­man be­ings are be­ing ab­sorbed into the to­tal­ity, without the to­tal­ity be­ing mastered by hu­man be­ings, makes in­sti­tu­tion­al­ized speech forms as void as the na­ively in­di­vidual valeurs \[French: stand­ards\], and the at­tempt to re­func­tion such by ac­cept­ing them into the lit­er­ary me­dium re­mains just as fruit­less: the en­gin­eer­ing pose of those who can­not read a dia­gram. The col­lect­ive lan­guage, which lures au­thors, who mis­trust their isol­a­tion as Ro­man­ti­cism, is no less Ro­mantic: they usurp the voices of those for whom they can­not at all im­me­di­ately speak, as one of them, be­cause their lan­guage, through re­ific­a­tion, is so sep­ar­ated from them as every­one is from every­one else; be­cause the con­tem­por­ary shape of the col­lect­ive is in it­self speech­less. No col­lect­ive today, which is en­trus­ted with the ex­pres­sion of the sub­ject, is already a sub­ject. Who­ever does not fol­low the dic­tates of the of­fi­cial hymn-tone to fest­ivals of lib­er­a­tion, which are su­per­vised by to­tal­it­ari­ans, but means in earn­est what Ro­ger Cail­lois am­bigu­ously enough re­com­men­ded as ]{.calibre3}[arid­ité]{.calibre22}[ \[French: arid­ity\], ex­per­i­ences the ob­ject­ive dis­cip­line solely as priva­tion, without get­ting back a con­crete gen­er­al­ity for this. The con­tra­dic­tion between the ab­strac­tion of that lan­guage, which wishes to clean house with what is the bour­geois-sub­ject­ive, and its ex­pressly con­crete ob­jects, lies not in the in­ca­pa­city of the au­thor, but in a his­tor­ical an­ti­nomy. That sub­ject wishes to cede it­self to the col­lect­ive, without be­ing sub­lated in it. That is why pre­cisely its re­nun­ci­ation of the private main­tains some­thing private, some­thing chi­mer­ical. Its lan­guage mim­ics, on its own ini­ti­at­ive, the strict con­struc­tion of so­ci­ety and ima­gines that it could make the very ce­ment speak. As pun­ish­ment, the un­con­firmed com­mon lan­guage in­cess­antly com­mits faux pas \[French: mis­step, mis­take\] of ma­ter­i­al­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Sach­lich­keit]{.calibre22}[\] at the ex­pense of the ma­ter­ial \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[\], not so dif­fer­ent from the bour­geoisie, when they wax rhet­or­ical. The lo­gical con­sequence of the de­cay of nu­ance is neither to ob­stin­ately hold fast to what is de­cay­ing, nor to ex­tirp­ate every single one, but wherever pos­sible to out­bid the very qual­ity of be­ing nu­anced, to drive it so far, un­til it re­coils from sub­ject­ive shad­ing into the purely spe­cific de­term­in­a­tion of the ob­ject. The writer must take the greatest care to en­sure that the word means the thing and only this thing, without side­long glances, in con­nec­tion with the chisel­ing of every turn of phrase, listen­ing with pa­tient ef­fort for what bears the lin­guistic, in it­self, and what does not. Those who are afraid, how­ever, of fall­ing in spite of everything be­hind the spirit of the times \[Zeit]{.calibre3}[geist]{.calibre22}[\] and of be­ing thrown on the trash-heap of dis­carded sub­jectiv­ity, are to be re­minded that what is newly ar­rived and what is, ac­cord­ing to its con­tent, pro­gress­ive, are no longer as one. In a so­cial or­der, which li­quid­ates the mod­ern as ret­ro­grade, then what may be­fall what is ret­ro­grade, if it is over­taken by the judg­ment, is the truth over which the his­tor­ical pro­cess rolls. Be­cause no truth can be ex­pressed, than the one which is cap­able of filling the sub­ject, the ana­chron­ism be­comes the refuge of what is mod­ern. ]{.calibre3}

[Which fol­lows Ger­man song]{.calibre22}[. \[con­clu­sion of Hölder­lin's Pat­mos\] -- Artists like George have re­jec­ted free verse as an in­ferior form, as a hy­brid of meter and prose. They are re­but­ted by Goethe and Hölder­lin's late hymns. Their tech­nical gaze takes free verse, for what it con­siders it­self. They are deaf to the his­tory, which stamps its ex­pres­sion. Only in the epoch of its de­cay are free rhythms noth­ing but in­ter­mit­tent prose sec­tions, set in an el­ev­ated tone. Where free verse proves it­self to be a form of its own es­sence \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[s\], it has emerged from the met­rical strophe, press­ing bey­ond sub­jectiv­ity. It turns the pathos of the meter against its own claim, the strict neg­a­tion of what is most strict, just as mu­sical prose, eman­cip­ated from the sym­metry of the eight-beat meter, is due to the im­plac­able prin­ciples of con­struc­tion, which ma­tured in the ar­tic­u­la­tion of what is ton­ally reg­u­lar. In free rhythm, the rubble of artist­ic­ally rhyme­less an­tique strophes finds its voice. These lat­ter, for­eign, ex­tend into mod­ern lan­guages and serve, by vir­tue of such for­eignness, to ex­press what is not ex­hausted in com­mu­nic­a­tion. But they give way, un­sal­vage­ably, to the flood of lan­guage in which they were raised. They sig­nify, with brit­tle­ness, in the midst of the realm of com­mu­nic­a­tion and not to be sep­ar­ated from the lat­ter by any caprice, dis­tance and styl­iz­a­tion -- in­cog­nito, as it were -- and without priv­ilege, un­til the wave of dreams washes over the help­less verses, as in Trakls lyr­ics. It is not for noth­ing that the epoch of free verse was the French re­volu­tion, the de­but of hu­man dig­nity and hu­man equal­ity. But isn't the con­scious pro­ced­ure of such verse sim­ilar to the law, which lan­guage above all obeys in its un­con­scious his­tory? Isn't all worked prose ac­tu­ally a sys­tem of free rhythms, the at­tempt to provide cover for the ma­gic bane \[Bann\] of what is ab­so­lute and the neg­a­tion of its ap­pear­ance \[Scheins\], an ex­er­tion of the Spirit \[Geistes\], to res­cue the meta­phys­ical force \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­walt]{.calibre22}[\] of the ex­pres­sion by vir­tue of its own sec­u­lar­iz­a­tion? If this were so, then a ray of light would fall on the labor of Sis­yphus, which every prose au­thor has taken on them­selves, since de­mytho­lo­giz­a­tion has passed over into the de­struc­tion of lan­guage it­self. Lin­guistic quixotry has be­come a com­mand­ment, be­cause every sen­tence struc­ture con­trib­utes to the de­cision as to whether lan­guage as such, am­bigu­ous from Ur-times to the present, falls prey to the bustle and the ded­ic­ated lies, which be­long to such, or whether it be­comes a sac­red text, by mak­ing it­self de­mure to­wards the sac­red ele­ment, from which it lives. The as­cetic seal­ing off of prose against verse is tan­tamount to an oath of fealty to song. ]{.calibre3}

[In nuce. ]{.calibre22}[\[Latin: in the ker­nel\] -- The task of art today is to bring chaos into or­der \[]{.calibre3}[Ord­nung]{.calibre22}[: so­cial or­der\].]{.calibre3}

[Artistic pro­ductiv­ity is the ca­pa­city of vo­li­tion in in­vo­li­tion. Art is ma­gic, eman­cip­ated from the lie of be­ing the truth. Since works of art were at one time de­rived from the fet­ishes -- can one blame the artists, when they be­have just a little fet­ish­ist­ic­ally to­wards their products? The art-form which since time im­me­morial raised the rep­res­ent­a­tion of the idea to the highest pitch of spir­itu­al­iz­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Vergeis­ti­gung]{.calibre22}[\], drama, is sim­ul­tan­eously ac­cord­ing to its in­ner­most pre­requis­ites ori­ented to­wards an audi­ence. When Ben­jamin re­marked, that the dumb lan­guage of things is trans­lated in paint­ing and sculp­ture into a higher, yet re­lated one, then one can as­sume in the case of mu­sic that it res­cues the name as pure sound -- but at the price of its sep­ar­a­tion from things. Per­haps the strict and pure concept of art is to be de­rived only from mu­sic, while great po­etry and great paint­ing -- pre­cisely the greatest -- ne­ces­sar­ily carry along with them some­thing ma­ter­ial, some­thing which strides bey­ond the aes­thetic en­sor­cel­ment, some­thing not dis­solved into the autonomy of form. The deeper and more con­sequen­tial aes­thet­ics be­comes, the more in­ap­pro­pri­ate it is to, say, the sig­ni­fic­ant nov­els of the 19th cen­tury. Hegel per­ceived this in­terest in his po­lemic against Kant. The be­lief dis­sem­in­ated by aes­thetes, that the work of art, as an ob­ject of im­me­di­ate in­tu­ition \[]{.calibre3}[An­schauung]{.calibre22}[\], is to be un­der­stood purely out of it­self, is not valid. The work of art has its bound­ary by no means merely in the cul­tural pre­requis­ites of an en­tity, its "lan­guage," which only the ini­ti­ated can fol­low. Rather, even where there are no such dif­fi­culties in the way, the art­work de­mands more, than just abandon­ing one­self to it. Who­ever wishes to find the ]{.calibre3}[Fle­der­maus]{.calibre22}[ beau­ti­ful, must know, that it is the ]{.calibre3}[Fle­der­maus]{.calibre22}[: their mother must ex­plain to them, that it is not about an an­imal with wings but about a cos­tume mask; they must re­mem­ber, that someone said: to­mor­row you may go to the ]{.calibre3}[Fle­der­maus]{.calibre22}[. To stand in the tra­di­tion meant: to ex­per­i­ence the work of art as some­thing con­firm­ing, af­firm­ing; in it, one takes part in the re­ac­tions of all those who ever saw it be­fore. If that once falls away, then the work is ex­posed in its bare­ness and fal­lib­il­ity. The pro­duc­tion turns from a ritual into idiocy, the mu­sic turns from a canon of mean­ing­ful phrases into stale and worn-out ones. It is truly no longer so beau­ti­ful. Mass cul­ture draws from this its right to ad­apt­a­tions. The weak­ness of all tra­di­tional cul­ture out­side of its tra­di­tion de­liv­ers the pre­text, to im­prove it and thereby to bar­bar­ic­ally vi­ol­ate it. What is con­sol­ing in the great art­works lies less in what they ex­press, than the fact that they suc­ceeded in de­fy­ing ex­ist­ence \[]{.calibre3}[Da­sein]{.calibre22}[\]. Hope is closest of all to those who are in­con­sol­able. Kafka: the sol­ipsist without ipse \[Latin: some­thing\] Kafka was an en­thu­si­astic reader of Kierkegaard, but he is con­nec­ted to the ex­ist­en­tial philo­sopher only in­so­far as one can speak of "an­ni­hil­ated ex­ist­ences." Sur­real­ism breaks the ]{.calibre3}[promesse du bon­heur ]{.calibre22}[\[French: prom­ise of hap­pi­ness\]. It sac­ri­fices the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of hap­pi­ness, which me­di­ated every in­teg­ral form, to the thought of its truth. ]{.calibre3}

[Ma­gic flute. -- ]{.calibre22}[That cul­tur­ally con­ser­vat­ive ideo­logy, which casts en­light­en­ment and art as a simple op­pos­i­tion, is un­true in­so­far as it fails to re­cog­nize the mo­ment of en­light­en­ment in the gen­esis of what is beau­ti­ful. En­light­en­ment does not merely dis­solve all the qual­it­ies, which ad­here to what is beau­ti­ful, but sim­ul­tan­eously pos­its the qual­ity of what is beau­ti­ful in the first place. The dis­in­ter­ested pleas­ure which works of art ex­cite ac­cord­ing to Kant, can only be un­der­stood by vir­tue of a his­tor­ical an­ti­thesis, which trembles in every aes­thetic ob­ject. What is con­sidered with dis­in­terest is pleas­ur­able, be­cause it once claimed the most ex­treme in­terest and ex­actly thereby can­cels out con­tem­pla­tion. This lat­ter is a tri­umph of en­lightened self-dis­cip­line. Gold and pre­cious gems, in whose per­cep­tion beauty and lux­ury are still mixed up in each other, were ven­er­ated as ma­gical. The light which they re­flec­ted, coun­ted as their self­same es­sence \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\]. What was struck by that light, fell sway to their bane \[Bann\]. That bane served early at­tempts to con­trol nature. They saw in them in­stru­ments to sub­jug­ate the course of the world with its own en­ergy, cun­ningly wres­ted from such. The ma­gic ad­heres to the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of om­ni­po­tence. Such ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] fell apart with the self-en­light­en­ment of the Spirit \[Geistes\], but the ma­gic lived on as the power of lu­min­ous things over hu­man be­ings, who once trembled in awe of them, and whose eyes re­mained en­sorceled by such a view, even where its stately claim was seen through. Con­tem­pla­tion, as the re­mainder of the stock of fet­ish­istic wor­ship, is sim­ul­tan­eously a stage of its over­com­ing. By giv­ing up its ma­gical claim, by re­noun­cing the vi­ol­ence, as it were, with which the sub­ject en­dowed it and thought to prac­tice with its help, lu­min­ous things trans­form them­selves into pic­tures of some­thing free of vi­ol­ence, into the prom­ise of a hap­pi­ness cured of the dom­in­a­tion over nature. That is the Ur-his­tory of lux­ury, which has mi­grated into the mean­ing of all art. In the ma­gic of what re­veals it­self in ab­so­lute power­less­ness, of what is beau­ti­ful, com­plete and void in one, the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of om­ni­po­tence is neg­at­ively re­flec­ted back as hope. It has es­caped every test of strength. Total pur­pose­less­ness denies the to­tal­ity of what is pur­pose­ful in the world of dom­in­a­tion, and only by vir­tue of such re­pu­di­ation, which the ex­ist­ent ful­fills in its own prin­ciple of reason out of the lat­ter's con­sequen­ti­al­ity, has the ex­ist­ing so­ci­ety, to this day, be­come con­scious of a pos­sible one. The bliss of con­tem­pla­tion con­sists of dis­en­chanted ma­gic. What ra­di­ates, is the re­con­cili­ation of mythos. ]{.calibre3}

[Art-fig­ure.]{.calibre22}[ -- To the un­pre­pared, the heaped up at­ro­cit­ies of house­hold or­na­ments are shock­ing due to their af­fin­ity with art-works. Even the hemi­spher­ical pa­per­weights, which show a fir-tree land­scape un­der glass with the title, greet­ings from Bad Wildun­gen, some­how re­calls to mind Stifter's green Fichtau, and the poly­chrome garden gnome re­calls a wight out of Balzac or Dick­ens. Neither the sub­jects nor the ab­stract sim­il­ar­ity of all aes­thetic ap­pear­ances \[Scheins\] are at fault here. On the con­trary, the ex­ist­ence of fool­ish and blatant junk ex­presses the tri­umph, that hu­man be­ings man­aged to pro­duce out of them­selves a piece of what oth­er­wise en­sor­cels them as toil­ers, and sym­bol­ic­ally break the com­pul­sion of ad­apt­a­tion, by them­selves cre­at­ing what they feared; and the echoes of the same tri­umph res­on­ate from the migh­ti­est works, even though they re­nounce that tri­umph and style them­selves as pure selves without re­la­tion to some­thing im­it­ated. In both cases, free­dom from nature is cel­eb­rated and re­mains thereby myth­ic­ally en­tangled. What hu­man be­ings were in awe of, turns into their own dis­pos­able thing. What pic­tures and post­cards have in com­mon, is that they make the Ur-pic­tures tan­gible. The il­lus­tra­tion "]{.calibre3}[L\'automne]{.calibre22}[" \[French: au­tumn\] in the read­ing-book is a déjà vu \[French: already seen\], the Ero­ica \[Beeth­oven's Third Sym­phony\], like great philo­sophy, rep­res­ents the idea as total pro­cess, yet as if this lat­ter were im­me­di­ately, sen­su­ously present. In the end the out­rage over kitsch is the rage, that it wal­lows shame­lessly in the hap­pi­ness of im­it­a­tion, which has mean­while been over­taken by a ta­boo, while the power of art-works is still secretly be­ing fed from im­it­a­tion. What es­capes the bane \[Bann\] of ex­ist­ence, its pur­poses, is not only what is bet­ter and protests, but also what relates to self-pre­ser­va­tion as what is less cap­able and dumber. This stu­pid­ity grows the more that autonom­ous art id­ol­izes its di­vided, al­legedly in­no­cent self-pre­ser­va­tion, in­stead of the real, guiltily im­per­ial one. By present­ing the sub­ject­ive in­sti­tu­tion as a suc­cess­ful res­cue of ob­ject­ive mean­ing, it be­comes un­true. What con­victs it of this is kitsch; the lat­ter's lie does not even feign the truth. It draws hos­til­ity to it­self, be­cause it spills the beans about the secret of art and the af­fin­ity of cul­ture to what is sav­age. Every work of art has its in­dis­sol­uble con­tra­dic­tion in the "pur­pose­ful­ness without pur­pose," by which Kant defined the aes­thetic; by rep­res­ent­ing an apo­theosis of mak­ing, the ca­pa­city to con­trol nature, which pos­its it­self as the cre­ation of second nature -- ab­so­lute, free of pur­pose, ex­ist­ing-in-it­self -- while non­ethe­less the mak­ing of things, and in­deed the ra­di­ance of the ar­ti­fact, is in­sep­ar­able from pre­cisely the pur­pose­ful ra­tion­al­ity which art wishes to break out of. The con­tra­dic­tion between the mak­ing of things and the ex­ist­ent is the life-ele­ment of art and cir­cum­scribes its law of de­vel­op­ment, but it is also its shame: by fol­low­ing, how­ever me­di­atedly, the preex­ist­ing schema of ma­ter­ial pro­duc­tion and "mak­ing" its ob­jects, it can­not for its part es­cape the ques­tion of the "what for," whose neg­a­tion is pre­cisely its pur­pose. The closer the mode of pro­duc­tion of the ar­ti­fact stands to ma­ter­ial mass pro­duc­tion, the more na­ively, as it were, does it pro­voke that fatal ques­tion. Works of art how­ever seek to si­lence the ques­tion. "What is per­fect," in Ni­et­z­sche's words, "should not be some­thing which has be­come." (]{.calibre3}[Hu­man, All Too Hu­man]{.calibre22}[, Vol. I, Aph­or­ism 145), namely it should not ap­pear as some­thing made. The more con­sequen­tially how­ever it dis­tanced it­self by per­fec­tion from the mak­ing of things, the more brittle its own ex­ist­ence, as some­thing made, ne­ces­sar­ily and sim­ul­tan­eously be­comes: the end­less pains taken to wipe away the trace of the mak­ing of things, dam­ages art­works and con­demns them to some­thing frag­ment­ary. After the dis­as­sembly \[]{.calibre3}[Zer­fall]{.calibre22}[: dis­in­teg­ra­tion\] of ma­gic, art has un­der­taken to pre­serve pic­tures for pos­ter­ity. In this work how­ever it avails it­self of the same prin­ciple which des­troyed pic­tures: the root of its Greek name is the same as that of tech­nics. Its para­dox­ical in­ter­weav­ing in the pro­cess of civil­iz­a­tion brings it into con­flict with its own idea. The ar­che­types of today, syn­thet­ic­ally pre­pared by film and hit-songs for the des­ol­ate in­tu­ition of the late-in­dus­trial era, do not merely li­quid­ate art, but blast the de­lu­sion into ex­ist­ence, through flag­rant idiocy, which is already im­mured in the old­est works of art and which lends power to even the most ma­ture. The hor­ror of the end casts a harsh light on the de­cep­tion of the ori­gin. -- It is the chance and lim­it­a­tion of French art, that it never com­pletely up­rooted the pride in the mak­ing of small pic­tures, just as it dif­fer­en­ti­ates it­self most strik­ingly from the Ger­man kind, in the fact that it does not ac­know­ledge the cat­egory of kitsch. In count­less sig­ni­fic­ant mani­fest­a­tions it throws a re­con­cil­ing gaze on what is pleas­ing, be­cause it was skill­fully pro­duced: what is sub­limely artistic holds on to sen­su­ous life through a mo­ment of harm­less pleas­ure in the ]{.calibre3}[bien fait]{.calibre22}[ \[French: well done\]. While this re­nounces the dia­lectic of truth and ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\], and thereby the ab­so­lute claim of what has not yet be­come per­fec­tion, the un­truth of those who Ha­dyn called the grand moguls is also avoided -- those who would ut­terly re­ject the fun of little dolls or post­cards and fall prey to fet­ish­ism pre­cisely by driv­ing out the fet­ish. Taste is the ca­pa­city to bal­ance in art the con­tra­dic­tion between what is made, and the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of what has not yet be­come; the true art-works how­ever, never as one with taste, are those which de­velop that con­tra­dic­tion to the ex­treme and come to them­selves, by go­ing to pieces on such.]{.calibre3}

[Trader's shop]{.calibre22}[. -- Hebbel raises the ques­tion, in a sur­pris­ing di­ary entry, as to what "would take the ma­gic from life in one's later years." "Be­cause we see in all the brightly colored, jerkily mov­ing pup­pets, the ro­tor which sets them in mo­tion, and be­cause just for that reason the en­ti­cing mul­ti­pli­city of the world dis­solves into a wooden mono­tony. When a child sees the ac­robats singing, the mu­si­cians play­ing, the girl car­ry­ing wa­ter, the coach­men driv­ing, it thinks to it­self, all this is hap­pen­ing due to pleas­ure and joy in the mat­ter; it can­not even be­gin to ima­gine that these people also eat and drink, go to bed and get up again. We how­ever know, what it's all about." Namely, about ac­quis­i­tion, which com­mand­eers all those activ­it­ies as mere means, re­du­cing them to ab­stract labor-time, as some­thing ex­change­able. The qual­ity of things turns from their es­sence \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\] into the ar­bit­rary phe­nomenon \[]{.calibre3}[Er­schein­ung]{.calibre22}[: ap­pear­ance\] of their value. The "equi­val­ent-form" dis­fig­ures all per­cep­tions: what is no longer il­lu­min­ated by light of one's own de­term­in­a­tion as "pleas­ure in the thing," pales be­fore the eyes. The or­gans do not grasp any­thing sen­sual in isol­a­tion, but ob­serve whether the color, tone and move­ment is there for it­self or for some­thing else; they grow weary of the false di­versity and sub­merge everything in grey, dis­ap­poin­ted by the de­cept­ive claim of qual­it­ies that they still ex­ist at all, while they are guided by the pur­pose of ap­pro­pri­ation, to which they for the most part owe their ex­ist­ence. The dis­en­chant­ment of the world of in­tu­ition is the re­ac­tion of the sen­sorium to its ob­ject­ive de­term­in­a­tion as a "world of com­mod­it­ies." Only things cleansed of ap­pro­pri­ation would be sim­ul­tan­eously col­or­ful and use­ful: neither can be re­con­ciled un­der uni­ver­sal com­pul­sion. Chil­dren how­ever are not so much en­tangled in il­lu­sions about the "en­ti­cing mul­ti­pli­city" as Hebbel thinks, rather it is that their spon­tan­eous per­cep­tion still com­pre­hends the con­tra­dic­tion between the phe­nomenon and fun­gib­il­ity, which the resigned one of adults no longer even dares to reach, and seeks to es­cape it. Play is their coun­ter­strike \[]{.calibre3}[Ge­gen­wehr]{.calibre22}[: counter, res­ist­ance\]. What strikes in­cor­rupt­ible chil­dren is the "pe­cu­li­ar­ity of the form of equi­val­ence": "Use-value turns into the form of ap­pear­ance of its op­pos­ite, value." (Marx, ]{.calibre3}[Cap­ital I]{.calibre22}[, Vi­enna 1932, page 61). In their non-pur­pos­ive do­ing they de­ploy a feint on the side of the use-value against ex­change-value. Pre­cisely by di­vest­ing the things which they handle of their me­di­ated util­ity, they seek to res­cue in their in­ter­ac­tion with them whatever has good will to­wards hu­man be­ings, rather than to­wards the ex­change re­la­tion­ship which de­forms hu­man be­ings and things in equal meas­ure. The little wag­ons on wheels lead nowhere, and the tiny bar­rels on them are empty; but they keep faith with its des­tin­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Bestim­mung]{.calibre22}[: de­term­in­a­tion\], by neither prac­ti­cing nor tak­ing part in the pro­cess of the ab­strac­tions which level out that des­tin­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Bestim­mung]{.calibre22}[: de­term­in­a­tion\], but rather pre­serve them as al­leg­or­ies of what they are spe­cific­ally are. They wait, scattered to the winds and nev­er­the­less un­entangled, to see if so­ci­ety fi­nally can­cels out the so­cial stigma on them; to see whether praxis, the life-pro­cess between the hu­man be­ing and the thing, will cease to be prac­tical. The un­real­ity of games an­nounces that what is real, is not yet real. They are un­con­scious prac­tice ex­er­cises of the right life. The re­la­tion­ship of chil­dren to an­im­als rests en­tirely on the fact that in the lat­ter, which Marx even be­grudged the sur­plus value they de­liver to work­ers, uto­pia is cloaked. Be­cause an­im­als ex­ist without any mis­sion re­cog­niz­able to hu­man be­ings, they rep­res­ent their own names as ex­pres­sion, as it were -- as what is ut­terly not ex­change­able. This en­dears them to chil­dren and makes their con­tem­pla­tion a joy. I am a rhino­ceros, sig­ni­fies the form of the rhino­ceros. Fairy-tales and oper­et­tas know such pic­tures, and the ludicrous ques­tion of the wo­man, who asked how we know that Or­ion is really called Or­ion, rises to the stars.]{.calibre3}

[No­vis­sumum Or­ganum. ]{.calibre22}[\[The new­est or­ganon: ref­er­ence to Ba­con's ]{.calibre3}[Novum Or­ganum]{.calibre22}[, the new or­ganon\] -- Long ago it was shown that wage-labor formed the mod­ern masses, and in­deed has pro­duced the work­ers them­selves. The in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] is uni­ver­sal not merely as the bio­lo­gical sub­strate, but sim­ul­tan­eously as the form of re­flec­tion of the so­cial pro­cess, and its con­scious­ness of it­self as some­thing ex­ist­ing in it­self, as the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] which it re­quires to raise its ca­pa­city of achieve­ment, whereas in­di­vidu­als func­tion in the mod­ern eco­nomy as mere agents of the law of value. The in­ner com­pos­i­tion of the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] is to be de­rived in it­self, not merely out of its so­cial role. What is de­cis­ive in the con­tem­por­ary phase is the cat­egory of the or­ganic com­pos­i­tion of cap­ital. What this meant in the the­ory of ac­cu­mu­la­tion was, "the growth in the mass of means of pro­duc­tion, com­pared with the mass of labor-power which brings it to life" (Marx, ]{.calibre3}[Cap­ital I]{.calibre22}[, Vi­enna 1932, page 655). When the in­teg­ra­tion of so­ci­ety, es­pe­cially in the to­tal­it­arian states, de­term­ines sub­jects ever more ex­clus­ively as par­tial mo­ments in the frame­work of ma­ter­ial pro­duc­tion, then the "trans­form­a­tion in the tech­nical com­pos­i­tion of cap­ital" per­petu­ates it­self through the tech­no­lo­gical de­mands of the pro­duc­tion pro­cess in those it not only en­com­passes, but in­deed first con­sti­tutes. The or­ganic com­pos­i­tion of hu­man be­ings is in­creas­ing. That through which sub­jects are de­term­ined in them­selves as means of pro­duc­tion and not as liv­ing pur­poses, rises just like the share of ma­chinery ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ vari­able cap­ital. The pre­val­ent talk of the "mech­an­iz­a­tion" of hu­man be­ings is mis­lead­ing, be­cause it thinks these lat­ter as some­thing static, which un­der­goes cer­tain de­form­a­tions due to an "out­side in­flu­ence," as am ad­apt­a­tion to con­di­tions of pro­duc­tion ex­ternal to them. But there is no sub­strate of such "de­form­a­tions," noth­ing which is ontic­ally in­ter­i­or­ized, on which so­cial mech­an­isms merely act from out­side: the de­form­a­tion is not the ill­ness of hu­man be­ings, but the ill­ness of the so­ci­ety, which raises its chil­dren as "hered­it­ar­ily dis­ad­vant­aged," just as bio­lo­gism pro­jects onto nature. It is only by means of the pro­cess, which ini­ti­ates the trans­form­a­tion of labor-power into a com­mod­ity, per­meat­ing hu­man be­ings ut­terly and com­pletely and mak­ing every one of their im­pulses sim­ul­tan­eously com­men­sur­able and ob­jec­ti­fied into an a pri­ori vari­ety of the ex­change-re­la­tion­ship, is it pos­sible for life to re­pro­duce it­self un­der the dom­in­at­ing re­la­tions of pro­duc­tion. Its or­gan­iz­a­tional fol­low-through \[]{.calibre3}[Dur­chor­gan­isa­tion]{.calibre22}[\] de­mands the am­al­gam­a­tion of what is dead. The will to live sees it­self re­ferred to the re­pu­di­ation of the will to live: self-pre­ser­va­tion an­nuls life in sub­jectiv­ity. It fol­lows that all the achieve­ments of ad­apt­a­tion, all the acts of con­form­ing de­scribed by so­cial psy­cho­logy and cul­tural an­thro­po­logy, are mere epi­phen­om­ena. The or­ganic com­pos­i­tion of hu­man be­ings refers by no means only to spe­cial­ized tech­nical cap­ab­il­it­ies, but -- and this is some­thing the usual cul­tural cri­tique wishes at no price to re­veal -- equally to their op­pos­ite, the mo­ment of what is nat­ural, which in­deed for its part already ori­gin­ated in the so­cial dia­lectic and now falls prey to it. What still dif­fers in hu­man be­ings from tech­nics, is in­cor­por­ated as a kind of lub­ric­a­tion of tech­nics. Psy­cho­lo­gical dif­fer­en­ti­ation, as it ori­gin­ally emerged in free­dom and out of the di­vi­sion of labor and the com­part­ment­al­iz­a­tion of hu­man be­ings ac­cord­ing to sec­tors of the pro­duc­tion pro­cess, it­self steps in the end into the ser­vice of pro­duc­tion. "The spe­cial­ized vir­tu­oso," wrote a dia­lec­tician thirty years ago, "the seller of their ob­jec­ti­fied and sub­stan­tial­ized \[]{.calibre3}[ver­sach­lichten]{.calibre22}[\] in­tel­lec­tual ca­pa­cit­ies\... ends up in a con­tem­plat­ive at­ti­tude to­wards the func­tion­ing of their own ob­jec­ti­fied and sub­stan­tial­ized \[]{.calibre3}[ver­sach­lichten]{.calibre22}[\] ca­pa­cit­ies. This struc­ture shows it­self most grot­esquely in the case of journ­al­ism, where it is pre­cisely sub­jectiv­ity it­self -- know­ing things, moods, the ca­pa­city to ex­press -- which turns into some­thing ab­stract, as in­de­pend­ent from the per­son­al­ity of the 'owner' as from the ma­ter­ial-con­crete es­sence of the ob­jects, which are dealt with in­de­pend­ently and nomothet­ic­ally \[]{.calibre3}[ei­genge­set­z­lich]{.calibre22}[\] as if by a mov­ing mech­an­ism. The 'lack of sens­ib­il­ity' of journ­al­ists, the pros­ti­tu­tion of their ex­per­i­ences and con­vic­tions, is only com­pre­hens­ible as the peak of cap­it­al­ist re­ific­a­tion." \[cita­tion from György Lukács, ]{.calibre3}[His­tory and Class Con­scious­ness]{.calibre22}[, Lon­don: 1971, page 100\] What was here es­tab­lished as the "phe­nom­ena of de­gen­er­a­tion" of the bour­geoisie, which it it­self still de­nounced, has mean­while emerged as the so­cial norm, as the char­ac­ter of full-fledged ex­ist­ence un­der late in­dus­tri­al­ism. It has long since ceased to be merely a ques­tion of the sale of what is liv­ing. Un­der the a pri­ori of salab­il­ity, what is liv­ing makes it­self, as the liv­ing, into a thing, into equipage. The ego con­sciously takes the en­tire hu­man be­ing into ser­vice as its ap­par­atus. In this re­or­gan­iz­a­tion, the ego gives, as a kind of en­ter­prise dir­ector, so much of it­self to the ego as a means of dir­ect­ing the en­ter­prise, that it be­comes wholly ab­stract, a mere ref­er­ence-point: self-pre­ser­va­tion loses its self. Per­sonal char­ac­ter­ist­ics, from genu­ine friend­li­ness to hys­ter­ical out­breaks of rage, be­come ser­vice­able, un­til they fi­nally slide per­fectly into their situ­ation-spe­cific as­sign­ment. With their mo­bil­iz­a­tion, they trans­form them­selves. They re­main only as light, fixed and empty shells of im­pulses, as ma­ter­ial trans­port­able at will, devoid of per­sonal traits. They are no longer sub­jects, but the sub­ject dir­ects it­self at them as its in­tern­al­ized ob­ject. In their bound­less ac­cess­ib­il­ity to­ward the ego, they are sim­ul­tan­eously ali­en­ated from the lat­ter: en­tirely pass­ive, they no longer nour­ish it. That is the so­cial partho­gen­esis of schizo­phrenia. The sep­ar­a­tion of per­sonal char­ac­ter­ist­ics as much from the basis of the drives as from the self, which com­mands them where it pre­vi­ously merely held them to­gether, causes hu­man be­ings to pay for their in­creas­ing in­ner or­gan­iz­a­tion with grow­ing dis­in­teg­ra­tion. The di­vi­sion of labor which is ful­filled in the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\], its rad­ical ob­jec­ti­fic­a­tion, ends up as its dis­eased split­ting. Thus the "psychotic char­ac­ter," the an­thro­po­lo­gical pre­requis­ite for all to­tal­it­arian mass move­ments. Pre­cisely the trans­ition from fixed char­ac­ter­ist­ics to push­but­ton modes of be­ha­vior -- seem­ingly en­liven­ing -- is the ex­pres­sion of the rising or­ganic com­pos­i­tion of hu­man be­ings. Quick re­ac­tions, free of any me­di­ation through con­sti­tuted be­ing, do not re­store spon­taneity, but es­tab­lish the per­son as a meas­ur­ing in­stru­ment, at the dis­posal of and read by the cen­ter. The more im­me­di­ate their sig­nal, the deeper in truth is me­di­ation re­flec­ted in them: in promptly an­swer­ing, non-res­ist­ing re­flexes, the sub­ject is en­tirely dis­solved. So too with the bio­lo­gical re­flexes, mod­els of the con­tem­por­ary so­cial ones, which meas­ured by sub­jectiv­ity are some­thing ob­jec­ti­fied, some­thing for­eign: it is not for noth­ing they are of­ten called "mech­an­ical." The closer or­gan­isms come to death, the more they re­gress to jerki­ness. It fol­lows that the de­struct­ive tend­en­cies of the masses, which ex­plode in the to­tal­it­arian states of both kinds, are not so much death-wishes as mani­fest­a­tions of what they have already be­come. They murder, so that whatever seems liv­ing to them, re­sembles them.]{.calibre3}

[Knacker's yard]{.calibre22}[. -- The meta­phys­ical cat­egor­ies are not merely the veil­ing ideo­logy of the so­cial sys­tem, but sim­ul­tan­eously ex­press its es­sence \[We­sens\], the truth about it, and in its trans­form­a­tions are pre­cip­it­ated those of the most cent­ral ex­per­i­ences. Thus death falls into his­tory, and con­versely this lat­ter con­versely is un­der­stood through the former. Its dig­nity re­sembled that of the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­vidu­ums]{.calibre22}[\]. The autonomy of such, which ori­gin­ated in the eco­nomy, ful­filled it­self in the con­cep­tion of its ab­so­lute­ness, as soon as the theo­lo­gical hope of its im­mor­tal­ity, which em­pir­ic­ally re­la­tiv­ized it, faded away. This cor­res­pon­ded to the em­phatic pic­ture of death, which en­tirely wiped out the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\], the sub­strate of all bour­geois con­duct and think­ing. Death was the ab­so­lute price of ab­so­lute value. Now it falls, along with the so­cially dis­solved in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\]. Where it is clothed with the old dig­nity, it chat­ters away with the lie, which already stood ready in its concept: to name what is im­pen­et­rable, to pre­dic­ate what is sub­ject­less, to pre­fab­ric­ate what falls out. In the ad­min­istered con­scious­ness, how­ever, the truth and un­truth of its dig­nity are done for, not by vir­tue of an oth­er­worldly hope, but in view of the hope­less lack of en­ergy of the sec­u­lar world. "Le monde mo­d­erne," noted the rad­ical Cath­olic Charles Péguy already in 1907, "]{.calibre3}[a réussi à avilir ce qu\'il y a peut-être de plus dif­fi­cile à avilir au monde, parce que c\'est quelque chose qui a en soi, comme dans sa tex­ture, une sorte par­ticulière de dig­nité, comme une in­ca­pa­cité sin­gulière d\'être avili: il avilit la mort.]{.calibre22}[ \[French: The mod­ern world has suc­ceeded in de­bas­ing some­thing which per­haps is the most dif­fi­cult thing to de­base in the world, be­cause it is some­thing which in it­self, as its tex­ture, has a pe­cu­liar sort of dig­nity, a sin­gu­lar in­ca­pa­city to be de­based: it de­bases death.\] (]{.calibre3}[Men and Saints]{.calibre22}[, New York 1944, page 98). If the in­di­vidu­ated \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­viduum]{.calibre22}[\] which death an­ni­hil­ates is null, devoid of self-con­trol and of one's own be­ing, then the an­ni­hil­at­ing power also be­comes null, as if in jest at the Heide­g­gerian for­mula of the ni­hil­at­ing \[]{.calibre3}[nichtenden]{.calibre22}[\] noth­ing­ness. The rad­ical re­place­ab­il­ity of the in­di­vidual prac­tic­ally makes its death -- in com­plete con­tempt -- to some­thing re­voc­able, as it was once con­cep­tu­al­ized in Chris­tian­ity with para­dox­ical pathos. Death how­ever be­comes totally in­cor­por­ated as a ]{.calibre3}[quant­ité nég­li­ge­able]{.calibre22}[ \[French: neg­li­gible quant­ity, minute smidgeon\]. For every hu­man be­ing, with all their func­tions, so­ci­ety stands ready with a wait­ing re­place­ment, who re­gards the former from the very be­gin­ning as the both­er­some holder of the job, as a can­did­ate for death. The ex­per­i­ence of death is ac­cord­ingly trans­formed into the ex­change of func­tion­ar­ies, and what does not com­pletely go from the nat­ural re­la­tion­ship of death into the so­cial one, is con­signed to hy­giene. Be­cause death is no longer per­ceived as any­thing more than as the drop­ping out of a nat­ural life-form from the so­cial club of so­ci­ety, this has fi­nally do­mest­ic­ated it: dy­ing merely con­firms the ab­so­lute ir­rel­ev­ance of the nat­ural life-form in re­la­tion to what is so­cially ab­so­lute. If the cul­ture in­dustry any­where test­i­fies to the trans­form­a­tions in the or­ganic com­pos­i­tion of so­ci­ety, then it is through the scarcely con­cealed con­fes­sion of this state of af­fairs. Un­der its lens, death be­gins to be­come comic. The laughter which greets it in a cer­tain genre of pro­duc­tion is in all like­li­hood am­bigu­ous. It still re­gisters the fear of some­thing amorph­ous un­der the net which the so­ci­ety has spun over the en­tirety of nature. But the veil is so vast and tightly-knit, that the memory of what is not covered seems fool­ish, sen­ti­mental. Since the de­cline of the de­tect­ive novel in the works of Edgar Wal­lace, which seemed to mock their read­ers through in­creas­ingly less ra­tional con­struc­tions, un­solved mys­ter­ies and crass ex­ag­ger­a­tions, and nev­er­the­less mag­ni­fi­cently an­ti­cip­ated therein the col­lect­ive imago of the to­tal­it­arian hor­ror, the genre of the murder-com­edy has formed. While it con­tin­ues to poke fun at the false shud­der, it de­mol­ishes the pic­tures of death. It rep­res­ents the corpse as what it has turned into, as a stage prop. It still re­sembles hu­man be­ings and is nev­er­the­less only a thing, as in the film ]{.calibre3}[A Slight Case of Murder]{.calibre22}[, where corpses are in­cess­antly trans­por­ted to and fro, al­leg­or­ies of what they already pre­vi­ously were. Com­edy sa­vors the false ab­ol­i­tion of death, which Kafka de­scribed long ago in the his­tory of the ]{.calibre3}[Hunter Grac­chus]{.calibre22}[ with panic: for the same reason, mu­sic is also be­gin­ning to be comic. What the Nazis per­pet­rated on mil­lions of hu­man be­ings, the mod­el­ing of the liv­ing on the dead, then the mass pro­duc­tion and cheapen­ing of death, threw its shadow in ad­vance on those who are spurred to laugh at corpses. What is de­cis­ive is the as­sim­il­a­tion of bio­lo­gical de­struc­tion in the con­scious so­cial will. Only a hu­man­ity, which is as in­dif­fer­ent to death as to its mem­bers -- one which it­self has died -- can ad­min­is­trat­ively in­flict death on myri­ads. Rilke's prayer for one's own death is the pi­ti­ful de­cep­tion of the fact that hu­man be­ings still only croak. ]{.calibre3}

[Come off it]{.calibre22}[. -- The cri­tique of the tend­en­cies of con­tem­por­ary so­ci­ety is auto­mat­ic­ally countered, be­fore it is fully ex­pressed, by say­ing that things have ever been so. The ex­cite­ment thereby so promptly ab­jured, test­i­fies merely to the lack of in­sight into the in­vari­ance of his­tory -- to an un­reason, which proudly dia­gnoses every­one as hys­ter­ical. Moreover, the critic's at­tacks are said to be merely ham­ming it up for the gal­lery, a means of claim­ing spe­cial priv­ileges, while whatever they are non­ethe­less up­set about is well known and trivial, so that no-one can be ex­pec­ted to waste their at­ten­tion on such. The evid­ence of the calam­ity comes to be­ne­fit its apo­lo­gists: be­cause every­one knows everything, no-one is sup­posed to say any­thing, and it may then con­tinue un­chal­lenged, hid­den by si­lence. What is af­firmed is what philo­sophies of all polit­ical stripes have trum­peted into the heads of hu­man be­ings: that whatever has the per­sist­ent grav­ity of ex­ist­ence on its side, is thereby right. One need only be dis­sat­is­fied to be already sus­pec­ted of be­ing a global dreamer \[]{.calibre3}[Welt­verbesserer]{.calibre22}[\]. The con­sensus em­ploys the trick of ascrib­ing to op­pon­ents a re­ac­tion­ary thesis of de­cay, which is un­ten­able -- for is not hor­ror in fact per­en­nial? -- by dis­cred­it­ing the con­crete in­sight into the neg­at­ive through its al­leged fail­ure of thought, and those who rise up against the shadow, are ma­ligned as agents of the shadow. But even if things were ever so, al­though non­ethe­less neither Timur nor Genghis Khan nor the Brit­ish co­lo­nial ad­min­is­tra­tion of In­dia de­lib­er­ately burst the lungs of mil­lions of hu­man be­ings with poison gas, then the etern­ity of hor­ror is re­vealed by the fact that each of its new forms out­bids the older ones. What en­dures is no in­vari­ant quantum of suf­fer­ing, but of its pro­gress to­wards hell: that is the mean­ing of the talk about the growth of ant­ag­on­isms. Any other kind would be in­noc­u­ous and would pass over into me­di­at­ing phrases, the re­nun­ci­ation of the qual­it­at­ive leap. Those who re­gister the death-camps as a minor ac­ci­dent in the vic­tory pro­ces­sion of civil­iz­a­tion, the mar­tyr­dom of the Jews as world-his­tor­ic­ally in­sig­ni­fic­ant, do not merely fall be­hind the dia­lect­ical in­sight, but in­vert the mean­ing of one's own polit­ics: of stop­ping the ex­tremity. Quant­ity re­coils into qual­ity, not only in the de­vel­op­ment of the pro­duct­ive forces, but also in the in­crease of the pres­sure of dom­in­a­tion. If the Jews are ex­term­in­ated as a group, while the so­ci­ety con­tin­ues to re­pro­duce the life of work­ers, then the com­ment that these former are bour­geois and their des­tiny un­im­port­ant to the lar­ger dy­namic, turns into eco­nomic spleen, even in­so­far as mass murder is in fact ex­plic­able by the de­cline of the profit-rate. The hor­ror con­sists of the fact that it al­ways re­mains the same -- the con­tinu­ation of "pre­his­tory" -- but un­re­mit­tingly real­izes it­self as some­thing dif­fer­ent, some­thing un­fore­seen, over­whelm­ing all ex­pect­a­tions, the faith­ful shadow of the de­vel­op­ing pro­duct­ive forces. The same du­al­ity ap­plies to vi­ol­ence, which the cri­tique of polit­ical eco­nomy poin­ted out in ma­ter­ial pro­duc­tion: "There are de­term­in­a­tions com­mon to all stages of pro­duc­tion, which are gen­er­ally fixed by thought, but the so-called uni­ver­sal con­di­tions of all pro­duc­tion are noth­ing but\... ab­stract mo­ments, by which no real stage of pro­duc­tion can be un­der­stood." \[Marx, ]{.calibre3}[Grundrisse]{.calibre22}[, page 88\] In other words, to ab­stract out what is his­tor­ic­ally un­changed is not neut­ral to­wards the mat­ter \[]{.calibre3}[Sache]{.calibre22}[\], by vir­tue of its sci­entific ob­jectiv­ity, but serves, even where it is on tar­get, as a fog in which what is tan­gible and as­sail­able dis­ap­pear. This lat­ter is pre­cisely what the apo­lo­gists do not wish to con­cede. On the one hand they are ob­sessed by the ]{.calibre3}[dernière nou­veauté]{.calibre22}[ \[French: latest nov­elty\] and on the other hand they deny the in­fernal ma­chine, which is his­tory. One can­not bring Aus­chwitz into ana­logy with the de­struc­tion of the Greek city-states in terms of a mere gradual in­crease of hor­ror, re­gard­ing which one pre­serves one's peace of mind. Cer­tainly, the mar­tyr­dom and de­grad­a­tion suffered by those in the cattle-cars, com­pletely without pre­ced­ent, casts a harsh, deathly light on the most dis­tant past, in whose ob­tuse and un­planned vi­ol­ence the sci­en­tific­ally or­gan­ized kind was already tele­olo­gic­ally at work. The iden­tity lies in the non-iden­tity, in what has not yet been, which de­nounces what has been. The state­ment that it's al­ways been the same, is un­true in its im­me­di­acy, true only through the dy­namic of the to­tal­ity. Who­ever al­lows the cog­ni­tion of the in­crease of hor­ror to es­cape them, does not merely fall prey to cold-hearted con­tem­pla­tion, but fails to re­cog­nize, along with the spe­cific dif­fer­ence of what is new­est from what has gone be­fore, sim­ul­tan­eously the true iden­tity of the whole, of hor­ror without end.]{.calibre3}

In the former, in the de­scrip­tion of the mael­strom, whose shud­der is equated with "the novel" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\], which none of the tra­di­tional re­ports is sup­posed to ad­equately give any idea of; in the lat­ter, in the last lines of the cycle ]{.calibre3}[La Mort]{.calibre22}[ \[French: death\], which chooses the plunge into the abyss, in­dif­fer­ent as to whether it is heaven or hell, "]{.calibre3}[au fond de l\'in­connu pour trouver du nou­veau]{.calibre22}[" \[French: to the bot­tom of the un­known to find the new\]. Both times it is an un­known threat, which the sub­ject en­trusts it­self to, and which in a dizzy­ing re­coil prom­ises pleas­ure. What is new, a blank spot of con­scious­ness, which one awaits with closed eyes, as it were, seems to be the for­mula by which pleas­ure can be taken in hor­ror and des­pair, as stim­u­lus-value. It causes evil to flower. But its stark out­line is a cryp­to­gram of the most un­am­bigu­ous re­ac­tion. It cir­cum­scribes the pre­cise in­form­a­tion, which is com­mu­nic­ated by the sub­ject to a world be­come ab­stract, the in­dus­trial epoch. What is re­belled against in the cult of the new and thereby in the idea of what is mod­ern, is the fact that there is no longer any­thing new. The un­chan­ging uni­form­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Im­mer­gleich­heit]{.calibre22}[\] of ma­chine-pro­duced goods, the net of so­cial­iz­a­tion, which in equal meas­ure catches and as­sim­il­ates ob­jects and the gaze at those ob­jects, trans­forms everything which is en­countered into some­thing which has already been, to the ac­ci­dental ex­em­plar of a spe­cies, to the model's dop­pel­ganger. The layer of what has not yet been thought, what is without in­ten­tion, in which alone in­ten­tion flour­ishes, seems to be con­sumed. The idea of the new dreams of this layer. It­self un­at­tain­able, it puts it­self in place of the fallen god in view of the first con­scious­ness of the de­cline of ex­per­i­ence. But its concept re­mains un­der the bane \[Bann\] of its ill­ness, and its ab­strac­tion test­i­fies to this, turn­ing power­lessly to the con­cre­tion which glides away from it. Much could be learned about the "Ur-his­tory of what is mod­ern" \[concept from Wal­ter Ben­jamin\] by ana­lyz­ing the change in the mean­ing of the word "sen­sa­tion" -- the exotic syn­onym for Baudelaire's nou­veau \[French: new\]. The word be­came uni­ver­sal­ized in European edu­ca­tion through epi­stem­o­logy. In Locke, it mean the simple, im­me­di­ate per­cep­tion, the op­pos­ite of re­flec­tion. It later be­came the great un­known and fi­nally, what is ex­cit­ing on a mass scale, de­struct­ively in­tox­ic­at­ing, the shock as con­sumer good. To still be able to per­ceive any­thing at all, re­gard­less of qual­ity, re­places hap­pi­ness, be­cause om­ni­po­tent quan­ti­fic­a­tion has taken away the pos­sib­il­ity of per­cep­tion it­self. In­stead of the ful­filled re­la­tion of ex­per­i­ence to the thing, some­thing what emerges is some­thing at once merely sub­ject­ive and phys­ic­ally isol­ated, sen­sa­tion, which ex­hausts it­self in the read­ing of a mano­meter. Thus the his­toric eman­cip­a­tion of be­ing-in-it­self is re­con­figured into the form of the in­tu­ition, a pro­cess which the sense-psy­cho­logy of the 19th cen­tury al­lowed for, by re­du­cing the sub­strate of ex­per­i­ence to a mere "basal stim­u­lus," from whose par­tic­u­lar con­sti­tuted nature the spe­cific en­er­gies of the senses were sup­posedly in­de­pend­ent. Baudelaire's po­etry how­ever is filled with that flash of light, which the closed eye sees when struck by a blow. As phant­asmagoric as this light, so phant­asmagoric is the idea of the new it­self. What flashes, while sed­ate per­cep­tion still only achieves the so­cially pre­formed mold of things, is it­self re­pe­ti­tion. The new, sought for its own sake, to a cer­tain ex­tent re­pro­duced in the labor­at­ory, hardened to a con­cep­tual schema, turns in the ab­rupt ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Er­scheinen]{.calibre22}[\] into the com­puls­ory re­turn of what is old, not so dis­sim­ilar to the trau­matic neur­oses. To the dazzled, the veil of tem­poral suc­ces­sion tears away from the ar­che­types of un­chan­ging uni­form­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Im­mer­gleich­heit]{.calibre22}[\]: that is why the dis­cov­ery of the new is satanic, eternal re­turn as dam­na­tion. Poe's al­legory of the novel con­sists of the breath­lessly circ­ling move­ment, non­ethe­less at a stand­still, as it were, of the boat spin­ning in the whirl­pool. The sen­sa­tions, in which mas­ochists aban­don them­selves to the new, are as much re­gres­sions. This much is true of psy­cho­ana­lysis, that the on­to­logy of Baudelaire's mod­ern­ity, like every other one which fol­lowed it, an­swers to the in­fant­ile par­tial drive. Its plur­al­ism is the col­or­ful ]{.calibre3}[fata mor­gana ]{.calibre22}[\[Latin: mirage\], in which what the mon­ism of bour­geois reason glosses as al­leg­or­ical hope, is that reason's self-de­struc­tion. This prom­ise com­prises the idea of what is mod­ern, and for the sake of its core, for un­chan­ging uni­form­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Im­mer­gleich­heit]{.calibre22}[\], everything which is mod­ern takes on, once it is barely aged, the ex­pres­sion of some­thing ar­chaic. ]{.calibre3}[Tristan]{.calibre22}[, which rises in the 19th cen­tury as an ob­elisk of mod­ern­ity, is at the same time the tower­ing monu­ment to the re­pe­ti­tion-com­pul­sion. The new has been am­bigu­ous since its en­throne­ment. While it links everything which presses bey­ond the unity \[]{.calibre3}[Ein­heit]{.calibre22}[\] of the ever more fixed ex­ist­ent, it is at the same time the ab­sorp­tion by the new, which, un­der the pres­sure of that unity, de­cis­ively pro­motes the dis­as­sembly \[]{.calibre3}[Zer­fall]{.calibre22}[\] of the sub­ject into con­vuls­ive mo­ments in which the sub­ject de­ceives it­self that it is still alive, and thereby ul­ti­mately pro­motes the en­tire so­ci­ety, which drives out the new in state-of-the-art style. Baudelaire's poem of the fe­male mar­tyr of sex, the murder vic­tim, al­leg­or­ic­ally cel­eb­rates the sanc­tity of pleas­ure in the ter­ri­fy­ingly eman­cip­at­ing still-life of crime, but the in­tox­ic­a­tion in view of the na­ked head­less body is already sim­ilar to that which drove the pro­spect­ive vic­tims of the Hitler re­gime to buy news­pa­pers, greed­ily and power­lessly, in which the meas­ures were an­nounced por­tend­ing their doom. Fas­cism was the ab­so­lute sen­sa­tion: in a de­clar­a­tion dur­ing the time of the first pogroms, Goebbels boas­ted that at least the Nazis weren't bor­ing. The ab­stract ter­ror of news and ru­mors was en­joyed in the Third Reich as the only stim­u­la­tion, which suf­ficed to mo­ment­ar­ily heat the weakened sen­sorium of the masses white-hot. Without the nearly ir­res­ist­ible vi­ol­ence of the de­sire for head­lines, which caused the heart to seize as if thrust back into primeval times, the un­speak­able could not have been borne by the on­look­ers, let alone the per­pet­rat­ors. In the course of the war, even­tu­ally the most ter­ri­fy­ing news was spread among the Ger­mans and the slow mil­it­ary col­lapse was not hushed up. Con­cepts like sad­ism and mas­ochism no longer suf­fice. In the mass so­ci­ety of tech­nical dis­sem­in­a­tion they are me­di­ated by sen­sa­tion, by the comet-like, far re­moved, to-the-ex­treme new. It over­whelms the pub­lic, which squirms un­der the shock and for­gets who the mon­stros­ity is be­ing per­pet­rated on, one­self or oth­ers. The con­tent of the shock be­comes truly in­dif­fer­ent ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ its stim­u­lus value, just as it ideally was in the in­voc­a­tions of the po­ets; it is even pos­sible that the hor­ror savored by Poe and Baudelaire, once real­ized by dic­tat­ors, loses its sen­sa­tional qual­ity, burns out. The vi­ol­ent res­cue of qual­it­ies in the new was devoid of qual­it­ies. Everything can, as the new, di­vested of it­self, be en­joyed, just as the numbed morphine ad­dict fi­nally reaches in­dis­crim­in­ately for any drug, even at­ropine. Every judg­ment per­ishes in sen­sa­tion, along with the dis­tinc­tion of qual­it­ies: that is what ac­tu­ally al­lows sen­sa­tion to be­come an agent of cata­strophic ret­ro­gres­sion. In the ter­ror of re­gress­ive dic­tat­ors, what is mod­ern, the dia­lect­ical pic­ture of pro­gress, cul­min­ates in an ex­plo­sion. The new in its col­lect­ive form, some­thing already hin­ted at by the journ­al­istic traits in Baudelaire as much the noise of drums in Wag­ner, is in fact ex­ternal life, cooked up as a stim­u­lat­ing and en­er­vat­ing drug: it is not for noth­ing that Poe, Baudelaire and Wag­ner were ad­dict­ive per­son­al­it­ies. The new turns into the merely evil first through to­tal­it­arian guid­ance, wherein that ten­sion of the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­vidu­ums]{.calibre22}[\] to so­ci­ety, which once real­ized the cat­egory of the new, is can­celed out. Today the ap­peal to the new -- re­gard­less of what kind, provided only it is ar­chaic enough -- has be­come uni­ver­sal, the ubi­quit­ous me­dium of false mimesis. The de­com­pos­i­tion of the sub­ject is com­pleted by hand­ing it­self over to a con­stantly dif­fer­ent, un­chan­ging uni­form­ity \[]{.calibre3}[Im­mer­gleich­heit]{.calibre22}[\]. This sucks everything fixed out of per­sonal char­ac­ter. What Baudelaire was cap­able of achiev­ing by vir­tue of the pic­ture, de­volves to fas­cin­a­tion devoid of will. Breach of faith and un-iden­tity, the pathic ca­ter­ing to the situ­ation, are ac­tiv­ated by the stim­u­lus of some­thing new, which as a stim­u­lus is already no longer stim­u­lat­ing. Per­haps hu­man­ity's re­fusal to have chil­dren is thereby ex­plained, be­cause every­one can proph­esy the worst: what is new is the secret fig­ure of every­one not yet born. Malthus be­longs to the Ur-fath­ers of the 19th cen­tury, and Baudelaire had reason to ex­alt what is in­fer­tile. Hu­man­ity, which des­pairs of its re­pro­duc­tion, un­con­sciously casts the wish to sur­vive onto the chi­mera of never known things, but these lat­ter re­semble death. They point to the down­fall of an en­tire con­sti­tu­tion, which vir­tu­ally no longer needs its mem­bers.]{.calibre3}

[151]{.calibre26}

[Theses against the oc­cult.]{.calibre22}[ -- I. The pen­chant for the oc­cult is a symp­tom of the re­gres­sion of con­scious­ness. It has lost the en­ergy to think what is un­con­di­tional and to with­stand the con­di­tional. In­stead of de­term­in­ing both, in unity and dif­fer­ence, in the labor of the concept, it heed­lessly mixes them up. What is un­con­di­tional turns into a fact, what is con­di­tional be­comes im­me­di­ately es­sen­tial \[]{.calibre3}[wesen­haft]{.calibre22}[\]. Mono­the­ism crumbles into a second myth­o­logy. "I be­lieve in as­tro­logy, be­cause I don't be­lieve in God," re­spon­ded an in­ter­viewee in an Amer­ican so­cial psy­cho­lo­gical study. The jur­idic­ally-minded \[]{.calibre3}[recht­s­prechenden]{.calibre22}[\] reason, which raised it­self to the concept of a god, seems to be caught up in the lat­ter's fall. The Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] dis­so­ci­ates it­self into spir­its \[]{.calibre3}[Geister]{.calibre22}[: spir­its, ghosts\] and thereby for­feits the ca­pa­city to re­cog­nize, that the lat­ter no longer ex­ist. The veiled tend­ency of calam­ity of so­ci­ety cons its vic­tims in the false rev­el­a­tion, in the hal­lu­cin­at­ory phe­nomenon. They hope, in vain, that its frag­ment­ary ob­vi­ous­ness will en­able them to look at the total doom in the eye and with­stand it. Panic breaks out once again after mil­len­nia of en­light­en­ment on a hu­man­ity, whose dom­in­a­tion over nature as dom­in­a­tion over hu­man be­ings sur­passes in hor­ror whatever hu­man be­ings had to fear from nature.]{.calibre3}

[II. The second myth­o­logy is even more un­true than the first. The lat­ter was the pre­cip­it­ate of the state of cog­ni­tion of its epochs, each of which showed its con­scious­ness of the blind nat­ural con­text to be some­what freer than the pre­vi­ous one. The former, dis­turbed and en­tangled, throws away the cog­ni­tion it once achieved of it­self in the middle of a so­ci­ety, which elim­in­ates through the all-em­bra­cing ex­change re­la­tion­ship even what is most ele­ment­ary, which the oc­cult­ists claim to con­trol. The gaze of the mar­iner at the Di­o­s­curi \[twin guard­ian deit­ies of sea-voy­agers in an­cient Greece, rendered as statues on the ship's prow\], the an­im­ism of trees and streams, in all the de­lusory be­daz­zle­ment at what is in­ex­plic­able, were ap­pro­pri­ate to the his­tor­ical ex­per­i­ences of the sub­ject ]{.calibre3}[vis-à-vis]{.calibre22}[ its ac­tion-ob­jects. As a ra­tion­ally util­ized re­ac­tion to­wards the ra­tion­al­ized so­ci­ety, how­ever, in which the booths and con­sulta­tion rooms of the spirit-seers of all grades, the re­born an­im­ism denies the ali­en­a­tion to which it test­i­fies and on which it lives, and sur­rog­ates a nonex­ist­ent ex­per­i­ence. The oc­cult­ist draws the most ex­treme con­clu­sion from the fet­ish-char­ac­ter of the com­mod­ity: threat­en­ingly ob­jec­ti­fied labor springs at them from ob­jects in the guise of count­less demons. What is for­got­ten in a world which has turned into products, its pro­duced­ness \[]{.calibre3}[Produziert­sein]{.calibre22}[\] by hu­man be­ings, is re­called in di­vided, in­ver­ted form, as some­thing ex­ist­ing in it­self which is ad­ded to and equated with the in-them­selves of ob­jects \[]{.calibre3}[An sich der Ob­jekte]{.calibre22}[\]. Be­cause these lat­ter have frozen un­der the light of reason, los­ing the ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\] of be­ing an­im­ated, that which an­im­ates them, its so­cial qual­ity, makes it­self some­thing nat­ur­ally-su­per­nat­ur­ally in­de­pend­ent, a thing among things.]{.calibre3}

[III. The re­gres­sion to ma­gical think­ing un­der late cap­it­al­ism as­sim­il­ates thought to late-cap­it­al­ist forms. The du­bi­ous-aso­cial mar­ginal phe­nom­ena of the sys­tem, the ram­shackle in­sti­tu­tions which squint through the cracks in its walls, in­deed re­veal noth­ing of what would be out­side, but mani­fest the en­er­gies of dis­as­sembly \[]{.calibre3}[Zer­falls]{.calibre22}[\] in the in­terior that much more. The small-time sages, who ter­ror­ize their cli­ents in front of a crys­tal ball, are toy mod­els of the big-time ones, who hold the des­tiny of hu­man­ity in their hands. The ob­scur­ant­ists be­hind "Psychic Re­search" \[in Eng­lish in ori­ginal\] are as quar­rel­some and con­spir­at­orial as so­ci­ety it­self. The hyp­nosis ex­er­ted by oc­cult things re­sembles to­tal­it­arian ter­ror: in con­tem­por­ary pro­cesses, both con­verge with each other. The smile of the augury has over­grown it­self into the scorn­ful laughter of so­ci­ety; it feeds on the im­me­di­ate ma­ter­ial ex­ploit­a­tion of souls. The horo­scope cor­res­ponds to the dir­ect­ives of bur­eaus on na­tion­al­it­ies \[]{.calibre3}[Völker]{.calibre22}[: lit­er­ally peoples or na­tions, but mean­ing a ho­mo­gen­ous eth­nic group\], and num­ber-mys­ti­cism is pre­par­a­tion for ad­min­is­trat­ive stat­ist­ics and car­tel prices. In­teg­ra­tion proves in the end to be the ideo­logy of the dis­in­teg­ra­tion into power-groups, which ex­term­in­ate each other. Who­ever casts their lot with them, is lost. ]{.calibre3}

[IV. The oc­cult is a re­flex-move­ment of the sub­jec­ti­fic­a­tion of all mean­ing, the com­ple­ment of re­ific­a­tion. When the ob­ject­ive real­ity seems more deaf to the liv­ing than ever be­fore, they seek to worm out its mean­ing through an ab­racadabra. Mean­ing is in­dis­crim­in­ately ascribed to the next worse thing: the ra­tion­al­ity of what is real, which is no longer quite con­vin­cing, is re­placed with dan­cing tables and rays from heaps of earth. The re­fuse of the world of phe­nom­ena \[]{.calibre3}[Er­schein­ung­swelt]{.calibre22}[\] turns into the ]{.calibre3}[mundus in­tel­li­gib­ilis ]{.calibre22}[\[Latin: world of in­tel­li­gible real­it­ies\] of the ail­ing con­scious­ness. It comes close to be­ing the spec­u­lat­ive truth, just as Kafka's Odradek would al­most be an an­gel, and is nev­er­the­less, in a pos­it­iv­ity which leaves out the me­dium of thought, only bar­baric er­ror, the sub­jectiv­ity which has re­lin­quished \[]{.calibre3}[en­täusserte]{.calibre22}[\] it­self and thereby fails to re­cog­nize it­self in the ob­ject. The more com­plete the dis­dain­ful­ness of what is passed off as "Spirit" \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] -- and in any­thing more an­im­ated the en­lightened sub­ject would of course re­cog­nize it­self -- the more the mean­ing sensed there, which in fact is totally ab­sent, turns into the un­con­scious, com­puls­ory pro­ject of the his­tor­ic­ally -- if not ne­ces­sar­ily clin­ic­ally -- dis­in­teg­rat­ing \[]{.calibre3}[zer­fal­lenden]{.calibre22}[\] sub­ject. It would like to make the world sim­ilar its own dis­as­sembly \[]{.calibre3}[Zer­fall]{.calibre22}[\]: that is why it deals with stage-props and ma­li­cious wishes. "The third reads out of my hand / It wants to read my mis­for­tune!" In the oc­cult, the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] groans un­der its own bane \[Bann\] like those caught in a bad dream, whose tor­ment in­creases with the feel­ing, that they are dream­ing, without be­ing able to wake up.]{.calibre3}

[V. The vi­ol­ence of the oc­cult, just like Fas­cism, to which it is linked by thought-schemata of the sort which pur­vey anti-Semit­ism, is not only pathic. It con­sists rather of the fact that in the lesser pan­a­ceas, cover-pic­tures, as it were, the con­scious­ness hungry for truth thinks it can grasp the dimly present cog­ni­tion, which of­fi­cial pro­gress of every type as­sidu­ously with­holds. It is that so­ci­ety, by vir­tu­ally ex­clud­ing the pos­sib­il­ity of the spon­tan­eous re­coil, grav­it­ates to­wards total cata­strophe. The real ab­surdity is the model for the as­tro­lo­gical one, which puts for­ward the im­pen­et­rable con­text of ali­en­ated ele­ments -- noth­ing is more for­eign than the stars -- as know­ledge about the sub­ject. The threat which is read out of the con­stel­la­tions, re­sembles the his­tor­ical one, which rolls on in un­con­scious­ness, in what is sub­ject­less. They can bear the thought that every­one is a pro­spect­ive vic­tim of a whole, which is merely formed from them­selves, only by trans­fer­ring that whole away from them­selves onto some­thing sim­ilar, some­thing ex­ternal to it. In the miser­able idiocy which they propag­ate, the empty hor­ror, they al­low them­selves to let out the clumsy misery, the crass fear of death and nev­er­the­less to con­tinue to repress it, as they must if they wish to con­tinue to live. The break in the life-line which in­dic­ates a hid­den can­cer is a fraud only in the place where it is as­ser­ted, in the hand of the in­di­vidual \[]{.calibre3}[In­di­vidu­ums]{.calibre22}[\]; where it would not give a dia­gnosis, in the col­lect­ive, it would be cor­rect. Oc­cult­ists rightly feel drawn to child­ishly mon­strous nat­ural-sci­entific fantas­ies. The con­fu­sion they cre­ate between their em­an­a­tions and the iso­topes of uranium, is ul­ti­mate clar­ity. The mys­tic rays are mod­est an­ti­cip­a­tions of the tech­nical ones. Su­per­sti­tion is cog­ni­tion, be­cause it sees all of the ciphers of de­struc­tion to­gether, which are scattered on the so­cial sur­face; it is fool­ish, be­cause in still clings to il­lu­sions, in all of its death-drive: glossing the an­swer, from the trans­figured form of so­ci­ety, dis­placed into the heav­ens, which can only be provided by the real trans­fig­ur­a­tion of so­ci­ety. ]{.calibre3}

[VI. The oc­cult is the meta­phys­ics of knuckle­heads. The sub­al­tern­ity of me­di­ums is no more ac­ci­dental than the apo­cryphal nature and tri­vi­al­ity of what is re­vealed. Since the early days of spir­it­ism, the bey­ond has an­nounced noth­ing more portent­ous than a greet­ing from a dead grand­mother next to a pre­dic­tion, that a jour­ney is in the off­ing. The ex­cuse that the spirit-world can­not com­mu­nic­ate to feeble hu­man reason any more than this lat­ter is able to take in, is just as silly, the aux­il­i­ary hy­po­thesis of the para­noid sys­tem: the ]{.calibre3}[lu­men nat­urale]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: "nat­ural light," in the sense of every­day hu­man reas­on­ing\] achieved greater things than the trip to the grand­mother, and if the spir­its do not wish to ac­know­ledge this, then they are man­ner­less ko­bolds, with whom one had bet­ter break off all con­tact. The ob­tusely nat­ural con­tent of the su­per­nat­ural mes­sage be­trays its un­truth. While it hunts out­side for what is lost, what it runs into there is only its own noth­ing­ness. In or­der not to fall out of the grey pro­sa­ic­ness, in which they feel right at home as in­cor­ri­gible real­ists, they ad­just the mean­ing, on which they re­fresh them­selves, into what is mean­ing­less, be­fore which they flee. The phoney ma­gic is noth­ing other than the phoney ex­ist­ence, which the former il­lu­min­ates. That is why it makes it­self at home with what is down to earth. Facts, which dif­fer from what is the case, only in that they are noth­ing of the sort, are worked up into the fourth di­men­sion. Their ]{.calibre3}[qual­itas oc­culta]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: hid­den qual­ity\] is solely their non-be­ing. They de­liver the world-view of idiocy. Ab­ruptly, drastic­ally, the as­tro­lo­gists and spir­it­ists is­sue a re­sponse to every ques­tion, which does not even solve the lat­ter, but can­cels any pos­sible solu­tion through crude sup­pos­i­tions. Their sub­lime realm, con­ceived as ana­log­ous to space, no more needs to be thought than chairs and flower-vases. It thereby re­in­forces con­form­ism. Noth­ing pleases the ex­ist­ent more, than the po­s­i­tion that ex­ist­ence, as such, is sup­posed to be mean­ing. ]{.calibre3}

[VII. The great re­li­gions have either, as in the Jew­ish one, kept in mind the sal­va­tion of the dead, after the ban on graven im­ages, with si­lence, or taught the re­sur­rec­tion of the flesh. They have their grav­ity in the in­separ­ab­il­ity of what is spir­itual \[]{.calibre3}[Geisti­gen]{.calibre22}[\] and what is cor­por­eal. There is no in­ten­tion, there is noth­ing "in­tel­lec­tual" \[\"]{.calibre3}[geistiges]{.calibre22}[\"\], which would not some­how be groun­ded in cor­por­eal per­cep­tion and de­mand cor­por­eal ful­fill­ment. To the oc­cult­ists, who con­sider them­selves above the thought of re­sur­rec­tion and do not at all wish for ac­tual sal­va­tion, this is too crude. Their meta­phys­ics, which even Hux­ley can no longer dis­tin­guish from meta­phys­ics, rests on the ax­iom: "The soul swings high into the air / the body rests on the couch over there." The feistier the spir­itu­al­ity, the more mech­an­istic: not even Descartes sep­ar­ated it so cleanly. The di­vi­sion of labor and re­ific­a­tion are driven to the ex­treme: body and soul are cut from each other in a per­en­nial vi­vi­sec­tion, as it were. The soul is sup­posed to dust it­self off, in or­der to con­tinue, in lighter re­gions, its eager activ­ity right at the point it was in­ter­rup­ted. In such a de­clar­a­tion of in­de­pend­ence, how­ever, the soul turns into the cheap im­it­a­tion of what it was falsely eman­cip­ated from. In place of the re­ci­pro­city, which even the most ri­gid philo­sophy up­held, the as­tral body sets up shop, the ig­no­mini­ous con­ces­sion of the hy­po­stat­ized Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] to its op­pon­ent. Only in the al­legory of the body is the concept of the pure Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geists]{.calibre22}[\] is to be grasped at all, and the former sim­ul­tan­eously sub­lates the lat­ter. With the re­ific­a­tion of the spir­its, the spir­its are already neg­ated. ]{.calibre3}

[VIII. Oc­cult­ists ful­min­ate against ma­ter­i­al­ism. But they want to weigh the as­tral body. The ob­jects of their in­terest are sup­posed to sim­ul­tan­eously sur­pass the pos­sib­il­ity of ex­per­i­ence and be ex­per­i­enced. Everything is sup­posed to be done strictly sci­en­tific­ally; the greater the hum­bug, the more care­fully con­trolled the test ar­range­ment. The pom­pos­ity of sci­entific con­trols is taken ]{.calibre3}[ad ab­surdum]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: to the point of ab­surdity\], where there is noth­ing to con­trol for. The same ra­tion­al­istic and em­pir­istic ap­par­atus which put an end to the spir­its, is em­ployed to man­dat­or­ily foist them off on those who no longer trust in their own ra­tio. As if any ele­ment­ary spirit would flee from the trap of the con­trol over nature, which is pos­ited by their fleet­ing es­sence \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\]. But even this the oc­cult­ists make use of. Be­cause the spir­its don't like con­trols, a door must be held open to them in the middle of se­cur­ity pre­cau­tions, so that they can make their ap­pear­ance un­dis­turbed. For the oc­cult­ists are prac­tical types. They aren't driven by idle curi­os­ity, they seek tips. Things go in a jiffy from the stars to fu­tures trad­ing \[]{.calibre3}[Ter­mingeschäft]{.calibre22}[: fu­ture trans­ac­tions, fu­tures, op­tions\]. Mostly the in­form­a­tion amounts to ill tid­ings for some ac­quaint­ance, who was hop­ing for some­thing. ]{.calibre3}

[IX. The car­dinal sin of the oc­cult is the con­tam­in­a­tion of Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] and ex­ist­ence, the lat­ter of which turns into an at­trib­ute of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[\]. This last ori­gin­ated in ex­ist­ence, as an or­gan de­signed to pre­serve life. Since ex­ist­ence is re­flec­ted in the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], this lat­ter turns at the same time into some­thing else. What ex­ists neg­ates it­self as the me­mori­al­iz­a­tion \[]{.calibre3}[Eingeden­ken]{.calibre22}[\] of it­self. Such neg­a­tion is the ele­ment of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[\]. To ascribe it once more to pos­it­ive ex­ist­ence, even if it were that of a higher so­cial or­der, would de­liver it to that which it stands against. Later bour­geois ideo­logy had made it once more into what it was in pre-an­im­ism, some­thing ex­ist­ing-in-it­self ac­cord­ing to the meas­ure of the so­cial di­vi­sion of labor, of the break between phys­ical and in­tel­lec­tual labor, and of the planned dom­in­a­tion over the former. In the concept of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geistes]{.calibre22}[\] which ex­ists in it­self, the con­scious­ness on­to­lo­gic­ally jus­ti­fies and etern­al­izes priv­ilege, by mak­ing it in­de­pend­ent of the so­cial prin­ciple, which con­sti­tutes it. Such ideo­logy ex­plodes into oc­cult­ism: the lat­ter is an ideal­ism which has come into it­self, as it were. Pre­cisely by vir­tue of the ri­gid an­ti­thesis of be­ing and Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], this lat­ter turns into a de­part­ment of be­ing. If ideal­ism had pro­moted the idea solely for the whole, that be­ing would be Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] and this lat­ter would ex­ist, then the oc­cult draws the ab­surd con­sequence from this, that ex­ist­ence means de­term­in­ate be­ing: "Ex­ist­ence is, ac­cord­ing to its be­com­ing, above all be­ing with some­thing non-be­ing, so that this non-be­ing is taken up in simple unity with be­ing. The non-be­ing thus taken up in be­ing, the fact that the con­crete whole is in the form of be­ing, of im­me­di­acy, com­prises the de­term­in­a­tion as such. " (Hegel, ]{.calibre3}[Sci­ence of Lo­gic I]{.calibre22}[, ed. Glock­ner, Stut­gart 1928, page 123). The oc­cult­ists take not-be­ing as a "simple unity with be­ing" lit­er­ally, and their kind of con­creity is a fraud­u­lent ab­bre­vi­ation of the path from the whole to the de­term­in­ate, which can claim that the whole, as some­thing once de­term­ined, is thereby noth­ing of the sort any­more. They call to meta­phys­ics, ]{.calibre3}[hic Rho­dus hic salta]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: here is Rhodes, here is where you jump\]: if the philo­soph­ical in­vest­ment of Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] with ex­ist­ence can be de­term­ined, then, they feel, any ran­dom, scattered ex­ist­ence must ul­ti­mately jus­tify it­self as a par­tic­u­lar Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\]. Con­sequently, the doc­trine of the ex­ist­ence of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], the most ex­treme ex­al­ta­tion of bour­geois con­scious­ness, would already tele­olo­gic­ally bear the be­lief in spir­its, its ut­most den­ig­ra­tion. The trans­ition to ex­ist­ence, al­ways "pos­it­ive" and jus­ti­fic­a­tion for the world, im­plies at the same time the thesis of pos­it­iv­ity of the Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], its ar­rest as a thing \[]{.calibre3}[Ding­fest­machung]{.calibre22}[\], the trans­pos­i­tion of what is ab­so­lute into the phe­nomenon \[]{.calibre3}[Er­schein­ung]{.calibre22}[\]. Whether the en­tire tan­gible world, as "product," is sup­posed to be Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] or any sort of thing any sort of Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], be­comes ir­rel­ev­ant and the world-spirit turns into the highest spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], to the guard­ian an­gel of what ex­ists, of what is de-spir­itu­al­ized. The oc­cult­ists live on this: their mys­ti­cism is the en­fant ter­rible \[French: scan­dal­ous young guard\] of the mys­tical mo­ment in Hegel. They drive the spec­u­la­tion to de­fraud­ing bank­ruptcy. By passing off the de­term­in­ate be­ing as Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\], they sub­ject the ob­jec­ti­fied Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] to the test of ex­ist­ence, and it must turn out neg­at­ively. No Spirit \[]{.calibre3}[Geist]{.calibre22}[\] is there.]{.calibre3}

[Not to be mis­used]{.calibre22}[. -- Dia­lectics ori­gin­ated in soph­istry, a pro­ced­ure of dis­cus­sion de­signed to shake dog­matic as­ser­tions, and, as pub­lic pro­sec­utors and com­ics call it, to make the weaker word into the stronger. It formed as a con­sequence of the per­en­nial method of cri­tique which op­posed ]{.calibre3}[philo­sophia per­en­nis]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: age-old philo­sophy\], the asylum of all thoughts of the op­pressed, even what they them­selves could never think. But as a means of be­ing right, it was from the very be­gin­ning also a means of dom­in­a­tion, the formal tech­nics of apo­lo­get­ics with no con­cern for con­tent, ser­vice­able to those who could pay: the prin­ciple, of al­ways and suc­cess­fully turn­ing the tables. That is why truth or un­truth does not stand in the method as such, but in its in­ten­tion in the his­tor­ical pro­cess. The split of the Hegel­ian school into a left and right wing was groun­ded in the am­bi­gu­ity of the the­ory no less than in the polit­ical situ­ation of the im­me­di­ate pre-1848 period. Dia­lectics en­com­passes not just the Marxian doc­trine, that the pro­let­ariat be­comes, as the ab­so­lute ob­ject of his­tory, its first so­cial sub­ject, cap­able of real­iz­ing the con­scious self-de­term­in­a­tion of hu­man­ity, but also the joke, which Gust­ave Doré put into the mouth of a par­lia­ment­ary rep­res­ent­a­tion of the ]{.calibre3}[an­cien ré­gime]{.calibre22}[ \[French: feudal or­der\]: that without Louis XVI the re­volu­tion would never have happened, there­fore this lat­ter is to be thanks for hu­man rights. Neg­at­ive philo­sophy, uni­ver­sal dis­sol­u­tion, con­stantly dis­solves too that which dis­solves. But the new form, in which both what is dis­solved and dis­solv­ing claim to be sub­lated, can never step for­wards purely in ant­ag­on­istic so­ci­ety. For as long as dom­in­a­tion re­pro­duces it­self, so too will the old qual­ity re­cru­desce in the dis­sol­u­tion of what dis­solves: in a rad­ical sense, there is no pure leap. That would first of all be the eman­cip­at­ory event, which ac­tu­ally hap­pens. Be­cause the dia­lect­ical de­term­in­a­tion of the new qual­ity sees it­self re­ferred back to the vi­ol­ence of the ob­ject­ive tend­ency, which hands down the bane \[Bann\] of dom­in­a­tion, it stands un­der the al­most un­avoid­able com­pul­sion, whenever it achieves the neg­a­tion through the labor of the neg­a­tion, to sub­sti­tute what is bad about the old for the non-ex­ist­ent other. The pro­fund­ity, with which it plumbs the depths of ob­jectiv­ity, is bought at the price of par­ti­cip­at­ing in the lie, that ob­jectiv­ity would already be the truth. By strictly de­lim­it­ing it­self to ex­tra­pol­at­ing the non-priv­ileged con­di­tion, from what owes to the pro­cess the priv­ilege of ex­ist­ing, it bows to res­tor­a­tion. This is re­gistered by private ex­ist­ence. Hegel ob­jec­ted to the lat­ter for its nullity. Mere sub­jectiv­ity, in­sist­ing on the pur­ity of its own prin­ciple, would en­tangle it­self in an­ti­nom­ies. It would go to pieces on its mis­chief \[]{.calibre3}[Un­wesen]{.calibre22}[\], hy­po­crisy and malevol­ence, to the ex­tent it does not ob­jec­tify it­self in so­ci­ety and the state. Eth­ics \[Moral\], autonomy pos­ited on pure self-cer­tainty, and even the con­science are mere ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\]. If "there is noth­ing eth­ic­ally real" (Hegel, ]{.calibre3}[Phe­nomen­o­logy of the Spirit]{.calibre22}[, ed. Las­son, 2nd Print­ing, Leipzig 1921, page 397), then it lo­gic­ally fol­lows in the ]{.calibre3}[Philo­sophy of Law]{.calibre22}[ that mar­riage is placed higher than the con­science, and that this lat­ter is said, even on its own grounds -- which Hegel, along with Ro­man­ti­cism, des­ig­nates as irony -- to be "sub­ject­ive van­ity" in a double un­der­stand­ing of the term. This mo­tif of dia­lectics, which op­er­ates through all lay­ers of the sys­tem, is sim­ul­tan­eously true and un­true. True, be­cause it un­veils the par­tic­u­lar as ne­ces­sary ap­pear­ance \[]{.calibre3}[Schein]{.calibre22}[\], the false con­scious­ness of what is split off, of be­ing only it­self and not a mo­ment of the whole; and it causes this false con­scious­ness to melt away through the en­ergy of the whole. Un­true, be­cause the mo­tif of ob­jec­ti­fic­a­tion, "dis­clos­ure" \[]{.calibre3}[En­täusser­ung]{.calibre22}[: re­lin­quish­ment, dis­clos­ure, real­iz­a­tion\], is de­graded into a mere ra­tion­al­iz­a­tion, into a pre­text for pre­cisely the bour­geois self-pre­ser­va­tion of the sub­ject, as long as the ob­jectiv­ity, which thought up­holds in op­pos­i­tion to what is badly sub­ject­ive, is un­free, re­gress­ing be­hind the crit­ical labor of the sub­ject. The word dis­clos­ure \[]{.calibre3}[En­täusser­ung]{.calibre22}[\], which ex­pects the re­demp­tion of private caprice from the obed­i­ence of the private will, ac­know­ledges, by ex­pressly hold­ing fast to what is ex­ternal as what is in­sti­tu­tion­ally op­posed to the sub­ject, in spite of all prot­est­a­tions of re­con­cili­ation, the en­dur­ing ir­re­con­cil­ab­il­ity of sub­ject and ob­ject, which for its part com­prises the theme of dia­lect­ical cri­tique. The act of self-dis­clos­ure \[]{.calibre3}[Selb­stentäusser­ung]{.calibre22}[\] is tan­tamount to re­nun­ci­ation, which Goethe de­scribed as sal­va­tional, and thereby jus­ti­fic­a­tion for the status quo, then as now. Out of the in­sight, for ex­ample, into the mu­til­a­tion of wo­men through pat­ri­archal so­ci­ety, in the im­possib­il­ity of wip­ing away the an­thro­po­lo­gical de­form­a­tion without its pre­requis­ite, it is pre­cisely im­plac­able dia­lec­ticians, without il­lu­sions, who may de­duce the stand­point of the mas­ter-in-the-house, speak­ing on be­half of the re­main­ing stock of the pat­ri­archal re­la­tion­ship. In this they lack neither for good reas­ons, such as the im­possib­il­ity of re­la­tions of a dif­fer­ent nature \[]{.calibre3}[Wesen]{.calibre22}[\] un­der con­tem­por­ary con­di­tions, nor even hu­man­ity to­wards the op­pressed, who have to pay the bill for false eman­cip­a­tion; but all this. though true, would turn into ideo­logy in the hands of mas­cu­line in­terest. Dia­lec­ticians know the un­hap­pi­ness and the aban­don­ment of the un­mar­ried spin­ster, of what is mur­der­ous in sep­ar­a­tions. By anti-ro­mantic­ally award­ing pri­or­ity to the ob­jec­ti­fied mar­riage over the eph­em­eral pas­sion, not sub­lated into the com­mon life, they would turn them­selves into the rep­res­ent­at­ives of those who propag­ate mar­riage at the cost of af­fec­tion, who love what they are mar­ried to, there­fore the ab­stract prop­erty-re­la­tion­ship. The fi­nal step of such wis­dom would be, that the per­son really doesn't mat­ter so much, if they would only ad­apt to the given con­stel­la­tion and do their duty. To pro­tect it­self from such tempta­tions, an en­lightened dia­lectics re­quires the un­ceas­ing sus­pi­cion against every apo­lo­getic, res­tor­at­ive ele­ment, which nev­er­the­less com­prises a part of what is un­naïve. The threat­en­ing re­lapse of re­flec­tion into what is un­re­flec­ted is be­trayed by the su­peri­or­ity, which switches on the dia­lect­ical pro­ced­ure and holds forth, as if it were it­self that im­me­di­ate know­ledge of the whole, which is ex­cluded pre­cisely by the prin­ciple of dia­lectics. The stand­point of the to­tal­ity is as­sumed, in or­der to slap down every de­term­in­ate neg­at­ive judg­ment by the op­pon­ent with the sign of the cau­tion­ary "that's not what was meant," and sim­ul­tan­eously to vi­ol­ently break off the move­ment of the concept, sus­pend­ing dia­lectics with ref­er­ence to the in­sur­mount­able grav­ity of facts. The calam­ity oc­curs through the ]{.calibre3}[thema proban­dum]{.calibre22}[ \[Latin: self-evid­ent sup­pos­i­tion\] one makes use of the dia­lectic in­stead of los­ing one­self in it. Then the sov­er­eignly dia­lect­ical thought would re­gress back to the pre-dia­lect­ical stage: the sed­ate ex­pos­i­tion, that every thing has its two sides.]{.calibre3}

[153]{.calibre26}

[At the end]{.calibre22}[. -- The only philo­sophy which would still be ac­count­able in the face of des­pair, would be the at­tempt to con­sider all things, as they would be por­trayed from the stand­point of re­demp­tion. Cog­ni­tion has no other light than that which shines from re­demp­tion out upon the world; all else ex­hausts it­self in post-con­struc­tion and re­mains a piece of tech­nics. Per­spect­ives must be pro­duced which set the world be­side it­self, ali­en­ated from it­self, re­veal­ing its cracks and fis­sures, as needy and dis­tor­ted as it will one day lay there in the mes­si­anic light. To win such per­spect­ives without caprice or vi­ol­ence, wholly by the feel for ob­jects, this alone is what think­ing is all about. It is the simplest of all things, be­cause the con­di­tion ir­re­fut­ably call for such cog­ni­tions, in­deed be­cause com­pleted neg­at­iv­ity, once it comes fully into view, shoots \[]{.calibre3}[zusam­menschiesst]{.calibre22}[\] into the mir­ror-writ­ing of its op­pos­ite. But it is also that which is totally im­possible, be­cause it pre­sup­poses a stand­point at a re­move, were it even the ti­ni­est bit, from the bane \[]{.calibre3}[Bannkreis]{.calibre22}[\] of the ex­ist­ent; mean­while every pos­sible cog­ni­tion must not only be wres­ted from that which is, in or­der to be bind­ing, but for that very reason is stricken with the same dis­tor­ted­ness and need­i­ness which it in­tends to es­cape. The more pas­sion­ately thought seals it­self off from its con­di­tional be­ing for the sake of what is un­con­di­tional, the more un­con­sciously, and thereby cata­stroph­ic­ally, it falls into the world. It must com­pre­hend even its own im­possib­il­ity for the sake of pos­sib­il­ity. In re­la­tion to the de­mand thereby im­posed on it, the ques­tion con­cern­ing the real­ity or non-real­ity of re­demp­tion is how­ever al­most in­con­sequen­tial.]{.calibre3}
