	[m1]\ [/m]
	\[Ol. 86.1 = 436/5\] Democritus of Abdera, Empedocles, Hippocrates the doctor, Gorgias and Hippias, Prodicus, Zeno, and Parmenides are considered famous philosophers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	b (≠ DK) Cyril of Alexandria, [c dimgray]Against Julian[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	They say that Democritus of Abdera, Empedocles and Hippocrates, and Prodicus, Zeno, and Parmenides were alive in the 86th Olympiad \[= 436/32\].

	P4 (< A5)
	[m1]\ [/m]
	a Plato, [c dimgray]Parmenides[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	\[Cephalus:\] Antiphon reported that Pythodorus had said that Zeno and Parmenides once came to the Great Panathenaic festival; and that Parmenides was already quite old, with very white hair, but was a fine man to look upon, around sixty-five years old, while Zeno was near forty at that time \[. . .\]; Socrates was very young at the time.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	b Athenaeus, [c dimgray]Deipnosophists[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	His age scarcely permits Plato’s Socrates to have conversed with Parmenides, let alone to have said or heard such speeches \[. . .\].
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]In 454, Socrates was sixteen years old; this date would be compatible with Jerome’s chronology (cf. P2a) if we suppose that Parmenides was born around 520 (cf. also P3a). The Apollodoran tradition represented by P1 presupposes instead a date of birth around 540, which would make this meeting impossible.

	\[. . .\] Xenophanes, the first of those \[scil. together with Parmenides and Melissus\] to have taught the One (for Parmenides is said to have been his pupil) \[. . .\] \[cf. XEN. R2\].

	P6
	[m1]\ [/m]
	a (< A1) Diogenes Laertius
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Parmenides of Elea, son of Pyres, studied with Xenophanes (Theophrastus says in his [c dimgray]Epitome[/c] that he \[i.e. probably Parmenides\] studied with Anaximander).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	b (< A2) [c dimgray]Suda[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Parmenides of Elea, son of Pyres, philosopher, was a disciple of Xenophanes of Colophon, but, as Theophrastus says, of Anaximander of Miletus.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The word order in P6a suggests that ‘he’ there should refer to Parmenides, and this is how the [c dimgray]Suda [/c]understands it. Many scholars have doubted that Theophrastus could have said that Parmenides studied with Anaximander and therefore refer ‘he’ to Xenophanes; but there are other cases of claims for intellectual affiliation that are impossible chronologically. T. Dorandi, [c dimgray]Elenchos[/c] 30 (2009): 347–53, on the basis of a reexamination of the mss., suggests that the words ‘studied with Xenophanes’ do not belong here.

But as Sotion says, he also associated with Ameinias the Pythagorean, son of Diochartas, a poor man but of a noble character ([c dimgray]kalos kagathos[/c]). It was this man that he preferred to follow, and when he died he founded a heroic shrine for him, as he was of noble birth and wealth, and it was by Ameinias, and not by Xenophanes, that he was guided toward tranquility.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The Ouliads of Elea seem to have been a caste of healers and priests of Apollo ([c dimgray]oulios[/c] is an epithet of Apollo in his quality as healer), and they may have revered Parmenides (who was represented by the statue on the base of which this inscription was written, found in the ruins of their building at Elea) as their heroic patron and presumed ancestor. But it should be noted that Ouliadês is a widely distributed personal name in ancient Greek (cf. [c dimgray]LGPN[/c] 1.355, 2.355, 5A.351, 5B.335–36), and the implications of this inscription remain uncertain.

	At the beginning of his [c dimgray]On Nature[/c] he writes as follows:

	\[The journey to the goddess\]
	The mares that carry me as far as ardor might go
	Were bringing me onward, after having led me and set me down on the divinity’s many-worded
	Road, which carries through all the towns (?) the man who knows.
	It was on this road that I was being carried: for on it the much-knowing horses were carrying me,
	[c dimgray]5[/c]Straining at the chariot, and maidens were leading the way.
	The axle in the naves emitted the whistle of a flute
	As it was heated (for it was pressed hard by two whirling
	Wheels, one on each side), while the maidens of the Sun
	Hastened to bring me, after they had left behind the palace of Night
	[c dimgray]10[/c]Towards the light[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and had pushed back the veils from their heads with their hands.

	One, continuous. For what birth could you seek for it?
	How, from what could it have grown? Not from what is not—I shall not allow
	You to say nor to think this: for it cannot be said nor thought
	That “is not”; and what need could have impelled it
	[c dimgray]15 \[B8.10\][/c]To grow later rather than sooner, if it had had nothing for its beginning?
	So it is necessary that it either be completely or not at all.
	And neither will any force of belief ([c dimgray]pistis[/c]) ever affirm that out of what is not[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]
	Something is born besides itself. That is why Justice
	Has not, loosening its fetters, allowed it either to be born or to be destroyed,
	[c dimgray]20 \[B8.15\][/c]But holds it fast. The decision ([c dimgray]krisis[/c]) on these matters depends upon this:
	“Is” or “is not”? Well, it has been decided, as is necessary,
	To abandon the one \[scil. road\] as unthinkable, unnameable (for it is not
	The true road), and \[scil. deciding\] thereby that the other, by consequence, exists and is real.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]25 \[B8.20\][/c]For if it was born, it is not, not any more than if it is going to be someday.
	In this way birth is extinguished, and unknowable destruction.
	Nor is it divisible, since as a whole it is similar,
	Nor at all more here, which would prevent it from cohering,
	Nor at all weaker, but as a whole it is full of being.
	[c dimgray]30 \[B8.25\][/c]That is why as a whole it is continuous: for what is is adjacent to what is.
	Moreover, motionless within the limits of its great bonds,
	It is without beginning, without ending, since birth and destruction
	Went wandering very far away—true belief ([c dimgray]pistis[/c]) thrust them away.
	Remaining the same and in the same \[scil. place\], it rests in itself
	[c dimgray]35 \[B8.30\][/c]And thus remains stable there; for powerful Necessity
	Holds it fast within the bonds of the limit, which confines it on all sides \[or: keeps it separate\].
	That is why it is not allowed that what is ([c dimgray]to eon[/c]) be incomplete.
	For it is not lacking \[scil. something\]; if it were, it would lack everything.
	This is the same: to think and the thought that “is.”

	By listening to the deceptive arrangement of my words.
	For they have established two forms to name their views,

	[c dimgray]60 \[B8.55\][/c]And they have divided their body into opposites and posited signs
	Separate from each other: for the one, the ethereal fire of flame,
	Being mild, very light in weight, the same as itself everywhere,
	And not the same as the other one; and that one too, in itself,
	The opposite, night without knowledge \[or: without light\], a dense and heavy body.
	[c dimgray]65 \[B8.60\][/c]I tell you this arrangement of the world, adapted ([c dimgray]eoikos[/c])[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] in every point,

	D11 (B11) Simplicius, [c dimgray]Commentary on Aristotle’s[/c] On the Heavens
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Regarding the sensibles, Parmenides says that he “begins to say”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	How the earth, the sun and the moon,
	The aether in common and the heavenly milk, farthest
	Olympus and the hot strength of the stars strove
	To be born
	and he teaches the origin of the things that are born and are destroyed, all the way to the parts of animals.

	D12 (B10) Clement of Alexandria, [c dimgray]Stromata[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You will know the aethereal nature, and in the aether all
	The signs, and of the pure torch of the brilliant sun
	The blinding works,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and from where they are born,
	And you will learn the recurrent \[or: wandering\] works of the round-eyed moon
	[c dimgray]5[/c]And its nature, and you will also know from where the sky, which is on both sides,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The term can mean ‘destructive,’ ‘completely visible,’ or else ‘hidden.’
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The heavens, in the restricted sense that Parmenides gives the term (D23, cf. D18), separate Olympus on high from the lower regions.
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Simplicius surely paraphrases the words that preceded the lines he is about to cite.

	\[1\] Parmenides \[. . .\] \[scil. explains sensation\] by the similar \[. . .\]. \[3\] Parmenides did not define anything at all except that, the elements being two in number, knowledge is in accordance with the one that prevails. For when the hot or the cold dominates, the thought becomes different. The better and the purer one of the two is the one produced by what is hot; but this one too requires a certain commensurability. \[. . .\] \[4\] For he speaks of sensation and thinking as being the same thing: this is why, for him, both memory and forgetting come about from these elements, by their mixture. \[. . .\] But the fact that he also explains sensation by one of the contraries taken by itself is clear from the passages in which he says that a corpse does not perceive light, heat, and sound, because fire has withdrawn,

	Physical are the ones \[i.e. hymns\] that Parmenides and Empedocles composed, explaining what Apollo’s nature is, what is Zeus’. \[. . .\] It is ones of this sort, whenever, reciting a hymn to Apollo, we declare that he is the sun, and discuss the nature of the sun, and \[scil. we say\] that Hera is the air, and Zeus is heat.

	he is writing poetry, he has recourse as well to a certain kind of mythic fiction. What is the difference then between saying this or, as Orpheus said, “a silver-shining egg”? And it is clear that some of his expressions are formulated more generally and accord with others that come later: as “ungenerated, indestructible” \[D8.8\] is appropriate both for the soul and for the mind, and “motionless” \[D8.31, 43\] and “remaining in the same” \[D8.34\] for the mind. But all of these expressions, heard all together in their purity, are appropriate to it. For even if in a certain sense the soul and the mind are ungenerated, it is starting from the intelligible that the term has been introduced.

	\[. . .\] those men \[i.e. Parmenides and Melissus\] accepted two kinds of existence, one of what truly is, the intelligible, and another of what becomes, the sensible, of which they did not think it right to say simply that it “is,” but that it “seems to be.” That is why what concerns being is truth and what concerns becoming is opinion. Parmenides says at any rate, \[. . . = D4.28–32\]. Moreover, after he has concluded the discussion about true being and is preparing to communicate his teaching about the perceptibles, he adds, \[. . . = D8.55–57\].

	For the first people to seek philosophically the truth and the nature of beings were turned aside, as though they had been pushed back to another road by inexperience, and they say that none of the things that are either comes about or is destroyed, since it is necessary that what comes about come about either out of what is or out of what is not, and that it is impossible that this happen out of either of these: for what is cannot come about (for it already is); and out of what is not, nothing could come about, for there must be some substrate. And in this way, exaggerating the consequence that immediately follows, they say that the multiple does not exist either, but only being itself.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]

	It is understandable that those who thought that what comes about comes about both from a certain substrate and from an efficient cause said that nothing comes about out of nonbeing, neither as from an element nor as from an efficient cause. For Parmenides was the first person of whom we have heard tell who, raising in his verses the question whether being is ungenerated, has written as follows: \[. . . = D8.11b–14a\].

	R21 (cf. ad B8) Simplicius, [c dimgray]Commentary on Aristotle’s[/c] Physics
	[m1]\ [/m]
	By saying this \[i.e. D8.8–19\] about what is in the primary sense, he demonstrates clearly that this being is ungenerated. For neither is it from being, for no other being preceded it; nor is it from nonbeing, for what does not exist does not exist either. And why then was it at this precise moment that it came about, and not also earlier or later? But neither is it from what in a certain way is but in a certain way is not, as comes about what comes about; for what in a certain way is but in a certain way is not could not precede what is in the simple sense, but appeared later than it \[cf. ad D8.18\].

	Parmenides of Elea \[. . .\] says that the whole is eternal and immobile and in conformity with the truth of things: for it is \[. . . = D8.9\]. He expels from the truth the generation of the things that seem, by a false conception, to exist, and sensations. He says that if anything exists next to what is, it is not a being; now, what is not does not exist in the universe. In this way then he accepts that what is is ungenerated.

	As for Parmenides, he supposes that the whole is one, eternal and ungenerated and spherical in shape, but he too did not escape from the opinion of the many, since he says that the principles of the whole are fire and earth, earth as matter, and fire as cause and agent. \[. . .\] The same man said that the whole is eternal, not generated, spherical in shape, and homogeneous, and that, not having any place within itself, it is immobile and limited.

	Parmenides too earlier \[scil. than Plato\] touched upon an opinion of this sort, inasmuch as he identified being and mind ([c dimgray]nous[/c]) and did not place being among the sensibles, when he said, “For it is the same, to think and also to be” \[D6.8b\].[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] And he says that it \[i.e. being\] is “motionless” \[D8.31\]—in spite of the fact that he adds to it thinking ([c dimgray]noein[/c])—removing from it all bodily movement, so that it stays in the same condition, and comparing it to “the volume of a ball” \[D8.48\], since it contains everything englobed within it and because thinking is not outside, but within it. But by calling it “one” \[D8.11\] in his writings, he exposed himself to the accusation that this one reveals itself to be multiple.

	one and immobile. \[. . .\] Going beyond sensation and disregarding it on the idea that one ought to follow reason ([c dimgray]logos[/c]), they say that the whole is one and immobile. \[. . .\]. So it is in this way and for these reasons that some people have made assertions about the truth; but even if this seems to be the case when what is involved are arguments, to hold this opinion when what is involved are facts is very similar to madness. For no madman is so insane as to think that fire and ice are the same thing, but it is only between what is beautiful and what seems to be beautiful because of habit that it seems to some people, because of their madness, that they do not differ at all.

	R45 (≠ DK) Aristotle, [c dimgray]Physics[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	To say that all things are at rest, and to seek an argument for this, dismissing sensation, is a kind of infirmity of thought, and the dispute is about the whole and not about a part: it concerns not only natural philosophy, but virtually all the sciences and all opinions, since they all have recourse to motion.

	R46 (≠ DK) Aristotle, [c dimgray]Physics[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	To investigate whether what is is one and immobile is not to investigate about nature: for just as the geometer no longer has any argument against someone who denies his principles, but this \[scil. sort of argument\] belongs either to a different science or to a science common to all the sciences, so too the same thing happens to someone \[scil.

	Some of them \[i.e. of the earlier philosophers\] completely abolished generation and destruction. For they say that none of the things that are either comes about or is destroyed, but that this only seems to us to be the case, like Melissus and Parmenides, who should not be thought to be speaking in terms of physics, even if otherwise they speak quite well. For that certain beings are ungenerated and in general immobile belongs to a kind of investigation that is different from and anterior to physics. But since they did not posit anything outside of the substance of the perceptibles, and since they were the first to think of natures of this sort, if knowledge or thought were to exist, they transferred to these realities arguments deriving from over there.

	\[. . .\] The same kind of objection \[scil. as against Melissus\] can be made against Parmenides, and other ones if there are any that are specific. And the solution is in part that it \[i.e. the argument by which being is one\] is false and in part that it is inconclusive. It is false insofar as it supposes that being is spoken of in only one way, although in fact it is spoken of in multiple ways; and it is inconclusive because, if one considered only white things, and white means only one thing, nonetheless the white things would

	Since we shall also hear Aristotle refuting the opinions of earlier philosophers, and, before Aristotle, Plato is seen to be doing likewise, and, before both of them, Parmenides and Xenophanes, one must know that these men, in their care for more superficial readers, refute what seems absurd in their writings, given that the ancients had the habit of revealing their thoughts in an enigmatic way. But it is clear that Plato, even though he seems to refute Parmenides, expresses his great admiration for him when he says that his thought requires a deep-sea diver.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] And Aristotle evidently recognized the profundity of his wisdom when he writes, “But Parmenides seems to speak <on the basis of more attentive consideration>” \[cf.

Yet those men \[i.e. Parmenides and Melissus\] accepted two kinds of existence \[. . .\]. How then could Parmenides have supposed “that only the perceptibles exist” \[scil. as Aristotle claims in R47\], given that regarding the intelligible he gives a philosophical account which it is superfluous to transcribe now? And how could he have transferred to the perceptibles what accords with the intelligibles, given that he taught on the one hand the unification of the intelligible and of what really is and on the other hand the organization of the world, treating these two clearly as separate matters, and did not think it right to call the perceptible by the name of being?

But he \[i.e. Parmenides\] does not abolish either of the two natures, but assigns to each one what is appropriate to it: he places the intelligible in the category of the one and of being (since he has called being eternal and indestructible, and one by virtue of its similarity to itself and because it does not
