	[b]Introduction[/b]

	Greek philosophy began in wonder at the repeated miracle of motion and change, and first manifested itself in an effort to discover the material (φύσις) out of which the universe is made, phenomena being regarded as the transient modifications of this permanent reality. It differed from earlier thought in that it discarded the myth, or fairy story, as an explanation, and substituted rational causation; it differed from later science in that it proceeded from an unproved postulate,
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] upon which it built deductively,
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] attaching little importance to observation of phenomena, and still less to experiment.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In considering the history of early philosophy we must remember that the age of mythology did not pass away suddenly and completely. Mythological figures, indeed, disappear, but the artistic spirit of the romancer, which demands a complete picture, led the Greek philosopher to indulge his imagination in supplying details for which he had no warrant from experience and observation.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Another fact to be borne in mind is that the conception of immaterial
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Called later on ὑπόθεσις.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]Deductive science preceded inductive, probably because of the influence of mathematics, the first science to reach a high state of development.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Heracleitus seems freer from this fault than many other early philosophers.

	existence was as yet unformed; soul and mind were looked upon as matter. The sciences, too, of logic and grammar were still to be born, and consequently men were often deceived by false analogies and verbal fallacies.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The first impulse to philosophic thought came, not unnaturally,
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] from a contemplation of the earth and sky; cosmologies succeeded cosmogonies. Thales of Miletus ([c dimgray]floruit[/c] 585 b.c.) looked upon the world as water modifying itself; Anaximander
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] (560 b.c.) as “the Boundless” modifying itself in two opposite directions; Anaximenes
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] (546 b.c.) as air modifying itself in two directions by thickening and thinning.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] In Western Greece the Pythagorean brotherhood, founded in the latter part of the sixth century, began under the influence of mathematical studies to lay stress upon the dualities apparent in the world.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Ionian school of material monists had their
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Observation of the sky was more common in days when there were no almanacs, no clocks, and no compass.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]Also of Miletus. His “Boundless” (τὸ ἄπειρον) may have been a kind of mist or cloud.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Also of Miletus. Pre-Socratic philosophy bears many traces of its Eastern birth, notably the religious tinge in its phraseology.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]In other words, Anaximenes took a quantitative view of change.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]The Pythagoreans apparently began with the pair even)(odd. See Aristotle, [c dimgray]Metaphysics[/c], A 986[c dimgray]a.[/c] Other (perhaps later) members of the brotherhood increased the number of pairs:—

	last representative in Heracleitus of Ephesus. He is said to have flourished in the sixty-ninth Olympiad (504–500 b.c.). We know practically nothing about his life, and the title of his writings, which have come down to us only in fragments, has not been preserved.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Heracleitus was called “the dark” by the ancients, who had all his work before them; to the moderns, who possess only isolated sentences, he is darker still. It is both confusing and depressing to read the treatises of Lassalle, Teichmüller and Pfleiderer, and to see how the most opposite and inconsistent conclusions can be drawn by learned and intelligent men from exactly the same evidence. But in spite of all this diversity of opinion there is gradually shaping itself a more stable view of the doctrine of Heracleitus in its main outlines, although the details are still obscure, and may, in fact, in some cases never be elucidated.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It seems reasonable to suppose, when we consider the period in which he lived, that the phenomenon of change was the primary interest of his researches. His contribution to the problem was to point out that change is constant and perpetual. For no two seconds together is a thing ever the same. There is no pause in change; it is as much a [c dimgray]continuum[/c] as is time. All things are for ever passing into something else.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In this eternal flux the only really constant thing is the principle of change itself, yet in some way or other fire, according to Heracleitus, has an individuality of its own which gives it precedence over all other things. The world “was ever, is now, and ever shall be an ever-living Fire, in measures being

	kindled and in measures going out.” Nothing could be plainer than this declaration of the eternal nature of fire, and nothing could be more logically inconsistent with the doctrine of perpetual flux. Hence several scholars have held that the fire of Heracleitus is not the fire which burns and crackles, but warm vital force or something even more abstract still. Such a conception seems alien from the thought of the period, and the most recent research regards the Heracleitean fire as the ordinary fire of the every-day world. It is perhaps rash to hazard a guess when so many scholars have been baffled, but it may be that Heracleitus consciously or unconsciously identified fire and change. If so, there is less inconsistency in regarding fire as an eternal reality, though it is bad interpretation to twist facts in order to make a Greek philosopher self-consistent; we are not warranted in assuming that all early philosophy [c dimgray]was[/c] consistent. Perhaps the fragments of Heracleitus do not support my guess, but the Heracleitean treatise [c dimgray]Regimen I[/c] expressly states that the δύναμις of fire is to cause motion.
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] In any case, symbolically or actually, fire is a good example of physical transformation. Fuel is supplied from below, the flames quickly alter its nature, and finally it rises as smoke and fumes. The most obvious and the most rapid changes with which we are familiar are all connected with fire; it destroys, it cleanses and it renews. The sun seems to be a great mass of the very best fire, and it is the sun that transforms, by its alternate advance and retreat, the face of the earth from
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[c dimgray]Regimen I,[/c] ch. iii. In this treatise δύναμις often means essence, and the sentence referred to virtually identifies change and fire.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[m1]\ [/m]
	season to season and from day to day. The world is an ever-living fire; it is always becoming all things, and all things are always returning into it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There is thus a twofold way in nature, to fire and from fire, and this leads us to the most fundamental thought of Heracleitus, the “attunement” or harmonious unity resulting from the strife of opposites.
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] There is a “road up” to fire and a “road down” from fire, and these two roads are “one and the same.” If they are one and the same, there must be a perpetual strain resulting from two, as it were, opposite forces. The way up fights with the way down. It is like the tension in a bowstring or in the cord of a harp. The flight of the arrow, the note of the string, are due solely to opposite tension (παλίντονος ἁρμονίη) This conception of universal strife dominated the theory of Heracleitus to such an extent that it is sometimes pushed to illogical extremes.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] Each opposite is tending to turn into its opposite, and so in a sense each is the same as the other. “God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, surfeit and hunger.” What Heracleitus really meant, and should have said, is that day and night, with all other opposites, are two sides of the same process, inseparably conjoined like concavity and convexity. Neither is possible without the other. Any explanation

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]See in particular Philo, [c dimgray]Rer. Div.

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]Strictly speaking, the two opposites should produce a third thing, as male and female produce the offspring, but there is no third thing produced by (say) night and day.

	of one will be the explanation of the other. It is “the common” that we should seek to know, that which manifests itself now as one thing and now as its opposite.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	We are told by Diogenes Laertius that the book of Heracleitus was divided into three parts, one dealing with the universe, one with politics and one with theology.
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Bywater has attempted with fair success to arrange the fragments under these three heads, his sections being Nos. 1–90, 91–97, 98–130.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	We have only a few fragments dealing with ethics and politics, and it is difficult to extract from them a definite ethical standpoint, but this was certainly dependent on the physical theory. Heracleitus lays great stress on “the common.” By this he meant, in the case of the State, the law, but it is harder to conjecture what meaning he attached to it in the case of the individual. The most attractive explanation hitherto given is that of Patrick.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] He holds that Heracleitus pleaded for unity with nature through obedience to the law of “the common.” Communion with the fields and trees could teach men more than discussing virtue and justice. Heracleitus stood for the instinctive, the unconscious, the naive. “The philosophy and ethics of Heracleitus, as we have seen, stood in vital opposition to”
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] over self-consciousness, too much inwardness and painful self-inspection, absence of trust in our instincts and of the healthful study of nature. We may be sure,

	too, that Heracleitus warned his readers not to expect too much. Perfect bliss is unattainable, for satisfaction is impossible without want, health implies disease, and rest implies painful effort.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The religious teaching of Heracleitus appears to have been directed against customs and ritual rather than against the immoral legends of Homer and Hesiod. He attacks idolatry, mystery-mongers and purification through blood. There is thus no evidence that he was a prophet of Orphism and the mysteries connected with that way of belief. His God must have been the “ever-living Fire,” but he appears to have believed that heroic men, who died through excess of fire ([c dimgray]i.e.[/c] in battle or other brave struggle), and not through excess of water ([c dimgray]i.e.[/c] through sottish habits or decay), became the guardians of the living and of the dead. So gods and men are in a sense one. “They live each others’ life and die each others’ death.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Patrick lays stress, and rightly, upon the stern, prophetic character of many of the fragments. Heracleitus is like a Hebrew seer. He despised all his contemporaries, both the common people and their would-be teachers. Hesiod, Pythagoras, Xenophanes and Hecataeus, all are attacked and condemned. As for the vulgar many, they are spoken of with contempt for their blindness, stupidity and grossness. “Thus the content of Heracleitus’ message to his countrymen was [c dimgray]ethical[/c]. It was a call to men everywhere to [c dimgray]wake up[/c], to purify their βαρβάρους ψυχάς, and to see things in their reality.”
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It was to this message, in all probability, that he

	refers in the word λόγος. Many commentators think that λόγος means “reason” or “law.” This was certainly the meaning attached to the word in the ethical system of the Stoics, but although this school borrowed largely from Heracleitus, they developed and indeed transformed his thought, adapting it to the more advanced conceptions of their own day. We are, in fact, tempted to look at Heracleitus through Stoic eyes, and so it is necessary to guard against this danger whenever we are dealing with an ancient statement about Heracleitus that comes from or through a Stoic source.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Our evidence for the doctrines of Heracleitus falls into two classes. We have first the fragments quoted by later writers, with their comments thereon. Then we have the so-called doxographies, or summaries of the views of philosophers. Several of these exist, but they are all derived, directly or indirectly, from a lost work of Theophrastus called Φυσικαὶ δόξαι. In the case of Heracleitus our chief doxographical evidence is contained in the ninth book of the scrappy series of lives of philosophers that goes by the name of Diogenes Laertius. The compiler, whoever he was, probably lived in the third century a.d.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I have followed Bywater in numbering the fragments, though occasionally I do not adopt his readings. Sincere thanks are due to the Delegates of the Oxford University Press for allowing me to use Bywater’s numbering and references.

	Life Of Heraclitus
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	Heraclitus, son of Bloson or, according to some, of Heracon, was a native of Ephesus. He flourished in the 69th Olympiad.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] He was lofty-minded beyond all other men,
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and over-weening, as is clear from his book in which he says: “Much learning does not teach understanding; else would it have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, or, again, Xenophanes and Hecataeus.”
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] For “this one thing is wisdom, to understand thought, as that which guides all the world everywhere.”
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] And he used to say that “Homer deserved to be chased out of the lists and beaten with rods, and Archilochus likewise.”
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Again he would say: “There is more need to extinguish insolence than an outbreak of fire,”
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] and “The people must fight for the law as for

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Taken from R. D. Hicks’ translation of Diogenes Laertius in the Loeb Classical Library. The spelling “Heraclitus” is retained. “D” = Diels and “B.” = By water.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]504–500 b.c.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]The biographers used by our author laid evident stress on this characteristic of the Ephesian, for §§ 1–3 (excepting two fragments cited in § 2) dwell on this single theme. As to the criticism of Pythagoras [c dimgray]cf.[/c] Clem. Alex. [c dimgray]Strom.[/c] i. 129 [c dimgray]s. f.[/c], who, dealing with chronology, says that Heraclitus was later than Pythagoras, for Pythagoras is mentioned by him.

	city-walls.”
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] He attacks the Ephesians, too, for banishing his friend Hermodorus: he says: “The Ephesians would do well to end their lives, every grown man of them, and leave the city to beardless boys, for that they have driven out Hermodorus, the worthiest man among them, saying, ‘We will have none who is worthiest among us; or if there be any such let him go elsewhere and consort with others.’ ”
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] And when he was requested by them to make laws, he scorned the request because the state was already in the grip of a bad constitution. He would retire to the temple of Artemis and play at knuckle-bones with the boys; and when the Ephesians stood round him and looked on, “Why, you rascals,” he said, “are you astonished? Is it not better to do this than to take part in your civil life?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Finally, he became a hater of his kind and wandered on the mountains, and there he continued to live, making his diet of grass and herbs. However, when this gave him dropsy, he made his way back to the city and put this riddle to the physicians, whether they were competent to create a drought after heavy rain. They could make nothing of this, whereupon he buried himself in a cowshed, expecting that the noxious damp humour would be drawn out of him by the warmth of the manure. But, as even this was of no avail, he died at the age of sixty.

	Hermippus, too, says that he asked the doctors whether anyone could by emptying the intestines draw off the moisture; and when they said it was impossible, he put himself in the sun and bade his servants plaster him over with cow-dung. Being thus stretched and prone, he died the next day and was buried in the market-place. Neanthes of Cyzicus states that, being unable to tear off the dung, he remained as he was and, being unrecognisable when so transformed, he was devoured by dogs.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He was exceptional from his boyhood; for when a youth he used to say that he knew nothing, although when he was grown up he claimed that he knew everything. He was nobody’s pupil, but he declared that he “inquired of himself,”
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and learned everything from himself. Some, however, had said that he had been a pupil of Xenophanes, as we learn from Sotion who also tells us that Ariston in his book [c dimgray]On Heraclitus[/c] declares that he was cured of the dropsy and died of another disease. And Hippobotus has the same story.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As to the work which passes as his, it is a continuous treatise [c dimgray]On Nature[/c], but is divided into three discourses, one on the universe, another on politics, and a third on theology. This book he deposited in the temple of Artemis and, according to some, he deliberately made it the more obscure in order that none but adepts should approach it, and lest familiarity should breed contempt. Of our philosopher Timon
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] gives a sketch in these words:

	Theophrastus puts it down to melancholy that some parts of his work are half-finished, while other parts make a strange medley. As a proof of his magnanimity Antisthenes in his [c dimgray]Successions of Philosophers[/c] cites the fact that he renounced his claim to the kingship in favour of his brother. So great fame did his book win that a sect was founded and called the Heracliteans, after him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Here is a general summary of his doctrines. All things are composed of fire, and into fire they are again resolved; further, all things come about by destiny, and existent things are brought into harmony by the clash of opposing currents; again, all things are filled with souls and divinities. He has also given an account of all the orderly happenings in the universe, and declares the sun to be no larger than it appears. Another of his sayings is: “Of soul thou shalt never find boundaries, not if thou trackest it on every path; so deep is its cause.”
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Self-conceit he used to call a falling sickness (epilepsy) and eyesight a lying sense.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] Sometimes, however, his utterances are clear and distinct, so that even the dullest can easily understand and derive therefrom elevation of soul. For brevity and weightiness his exposition is incomparable.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Coming now to his particular tenets, we may state them as follows: fire is the element, all things are exchange for fire and come into being by rarefaction and condensation
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]; but of this he gives no clear explanation. All things come into being by conflict of opposites, and the sum of things flows like a stream. Further, all that is is limited and forms one world.

	And it is alternately born from fire and again resolved into fire in fixed cycles to all eternity, and this is determined by destiny. Of the opposites that which tends to birth or creation is called war and strife, and that which tends to destruction by fire is called concord and peace.
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Change he called a pathway up and down, and this determines the birth of the world.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For fire by contracting turns into moisture, and this condensing turns into water; water again when congealed turns into earth. This process he calls the downward path. Then again earth is liquefied, and thus gives rise to water, and from water the rest of the series is derived. He reduces nearly everything to exhalation from the sea. This process is the upward path. Exhalations arise from earth as well as from sea; those from sea are bright and pure, those from earth dark. Fire is fed by the bright exhalations, the moist element by the others. He does not make clear the nature of the surrounding element. He says, however, that there are in it bowls with their concavities turned towards us, in which the bright exhalations collect and produce flames. These are the stars. The flame of the sun is the brightest and the hottest; the other stars are further from the earth and for that reason give it less light and heat. The moon, which is nearer to the earth, traverses a region which is not pure. The sun, however, moves in a clear and untroubled region, and keeps a proportionate distance from us. That is why it gives us more heat and light. Eclipses of the sun and moon occur when the bowls are turned

	upwards; the monthly phases of the moon are due to the bowl turning round in its place little by little. Day and night, months, seasons and years, rains and winds and other similar phenomema are accounted for by the various exhalations. Thus the bright exhalation, set aflame in the hollow orb of the sun, produces day, the opposite exhalation when it has got the mastery causes night; the increase of warmth due to the bright exhalation produces summer, whereas the preponderance of moisture due to the dark exhalation brings about winter. His explanations of other phenomena are in harmony with this. He gives no account of the nature of the earth, nor even of the bowls. These, then, were his opinions.

	world, for one and all alike.“We are told that, when asked why he kept silence, he replied, “Why, to let you chatter.” Darius, too, was eager to make his acquaintance, and wrote to him as follows
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“King Darius, son of Hystaspes, to Heraclitus the wise man of Ephesus, greeting.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“You are the author of a treatise [c dimgray]On Nature[/c] which is hard to understand and hard to interpret. In certain parts, if it be interpreted word for word, it seems to contain a power of speculation on the whole universe and all that goes on within it, which depends upon motion most divine; but for the most part judgement is suspended, so that even those who are the most conversant with literature are at a loss to know what is the right interpretation of your work. Accordingly King Darius, son of Hystaspes, wishes to enjoy your instruction and Greek culture. Come then with all speed to see me at my palace. For the Greeks as a rule are not prone to mark their wise men; nay, they neglect their excellent precepts which make for good hearing and learning. But at my court there is secured for you every privilege and daily conversation of a good and worthy kind, and a life in keeping with your counsels.”

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The request of Darius is mentioned by Clem. Alex. [c dimgray]Strom[/c], i. 65 οὗτος βασιλέα Δαρεῖον παρακαλοῦντα ἥκειν εἰς Πέρσας ὑπερεῖδεν. The story is not made more plausible by the two forged letters to which it must have given rise.

	I, being forgetful of all wickedness, shunning the general satiety which is closely joined with envy, and because I have a horror of splendour, could not come to Persia, being content with little, when that little is to my mind.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So independent was he even when dealing with a king.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Demetrius, in his book on [c dimgray]Men of the Same Name[/c], says that he despised even the Athenians, although held by them in the highest estimation; and, notwithstanding that the Ephesians thought little of him, he preferred his own home the more. Demetrius of Phalerum, too, mentions him in his [c dimgray]Defence of Socrates[/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]; and the commentators on his work are very numerous, including as they do Antisthenes and Heraclides of Pontus, Cleanthes and Sphaerus the Stoic, and again Pausanius who was called the imitator of Heraclitus, Nicomedes, Dionysius, and among the grammarians, Diodotus. The latter affirms that it is not a treatise upon nature, but upon government, the physical part serving merely for illustration.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	Hieronymus tells us that Scythinus, the satirical poet, undertook to put the discourse of Heraclitus into verse. He is the subject of many epigrams, and amongst them of this one

	Five men have borne the name of Heraclitus: (1) our philosopher; (2) a lyric poet, who wrote a hymn of praise to the twelve gods; (3) an elegiac poet of Halicarnassus, on whom Callimachus wrote the following epitaph

	They told me, Heraclitus, they told me you were dead,
	They brought me bitter news to hear and bitter tears to shed.
	I wept as I remembered how often you and I
	Had tired the sun with talking and sent him down the sky.

	And now that thou art lying, my dear old Carian guest,
	A handful of grey ashes, long, long ago at rest,
	Still are thy pleasant voices, thy nightingales, awake;

In bare prose: “One told me of thy death, Heraclitus, and moved me to tears, when I remembered how often we two watched the sun go down upon our talk. But though thou, I ween, my Halicarnassian friend, art dust long, long ago, yet do thy ‘Nightingales’ live on, and Death, that insatiate ravisher, shall lay no hand on them.” Perhaps “Nightingales” was the title of a work. Laertius deserves our gratitude for inserting this little poem, especially on so slight a pretext.

	[b]ΗΡΑΚΛΕΙΤΟΥ ΕΦΕΣΙΟΥ ΠΕΡΙ ΤΟΥ ΠΑΝΤΟΣ.[/b]

	[c dimgray]The order of the fragments is that of Bywater.[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]

	I. Οὐκ ἐμεῦ ἀλλὰ τοῦ λόγου ἀκούσαντας
	[c dimgray]2[/c]ὁμολογέειν σοφόν ἐστι, ἓν πάντα εἶναι.

	II. Τοῦ δὲ λόγου τοῦδ᾿ ἐόντος αἰεὶ ἀξύνετοι

	ἀκούσαντες τὸ πρῶτον. γινομένων γὰρ πάντων

	λανθάνει ὁκόσα ἐγερθέντες ποιέουσι, ὅκωσπερ
	[c dimgray]9[/c]ὁκόσα εὕδοντες ἐπιλανθάνονται.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]I[/sup][/c]Hippolytus [c dimgray]Ref. Haer.[/c] ix. 9: Ἡράκλειτος μὲν οὖν <ἕν>
	φησιν εἶναι τὸ πᾶν, διαιρετὸν ἀδιαίρετον, γενητὸν ἀγένητον,
	θνητὸν ἀθάνατον, λόγον αἰῶνα, πατέρα υἱόν, θεὸν δίκαιον. Οὐκ
	ἐμοῦ ἀλλὰ τοῦ δόγματος ἀκούσαντας ὁμολογεῖν σοφόν ἐστιν, ἓν
	πάντα εἰδέναι, ὁ Ἡράκλειτός φησι· καὶ ὅτι τοῦτο οὐκ ἴσασι
	πάντες οὐδὲ ὁμολογοῦσιν, ἐπιμέμφεται ὧδέ πως· Οὐ ξυνίασιν ὅκως
	διαφερόμενον ἑωυτῷ ὁμολογέει· παλίντροπος ἁρμονίη ὅκωσπερ
	τόξου καὶ λύρης.
	λόγου is a conjecture of Bernays, εἶναι a conjecture of
	Miller. Bergk would reconstruct thus: δίκαιον οὐκ ἐμοῦ
	ἀλλὰ τοῦ δόγματος ἀκούσαντας ὁμολογέειν ὅτι ἓν τὸ σοφόν ἐστιν,
	ἓν πάντα εἰδέναι. The conjectures in the text do not arouse
	any strong confidence, though δόγματος might well be a
	gloss on λόγου. But if εἶναι be correct, why should it have
	been corrupted to εἰδέναι? I am on the whole inclined to
	think that Bergk’s restoration is nearer to the actual words
	of Heracleitus. Hipp. [c dimgray]Ref. Haer[/c]. ix. 9; Aristotle [c dimgray]Rhetoric[/c] iii. 5; Sextus Empiricus [c dimgray]adversus Mathematicos[/c] vii. 132; Clement of Alex. [c dimgray]Strom[/c]. v. 14, p. 716; Eusebius [c dimgray]Praep. Εn.[/c] xiii 13, p. 680. The MSS. (except those of Sextus) read τοῦ δεόντος.

	I. It is wise to listen, not to me but to the Word, and to confess that all things are one.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For λόγος see Heinze, [c dimgray]Lehre vom Logos[/c], 1873; Zeller, i. 630; Aall, [c dimgray]Gesch. d. Logosidee[/c] 1896. “All things are one” because they are all resolved into fire and come from fire.

	II. This Word, which is ever true, men prove as incapable of understanding when they hear it for the first time as before they have heard it at all. For although all things happen in accordance with this Word, men seem as though they had no experience thereof, when they make experiment with such words and works as I relate, dividing each thing according to its nature and setting forth how it really is. The rest of men know not what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do when asleep.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Aristotle was in doubt whether αἰεὶ should be taken with ἐόντος or with ἀξύνετοι γίνονται. See [c dimgray]Rhetoric[/c], III. 5, 1407, [c dimgray]b[/c] 14. ἐόντος means “true” in Ionic with words like λόγος. See Burnet, [c dimgray]E. G. Ph.[/c] note on Fragment II. I have tried in my translation to bring out the play on words in ἀπείροισι ἐοίκασι πειρώμενοι.

	III. The stupid when they have heard are like the deaf; of them does the proverb bear witness that when present they are absent.

	IV. Bad witnesses are eyes and ears to men, if they have souls that understand not their language.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This passage is not a general attack on the senses; it merely lays stress on the need of an intelligent soul to interpret the sense-impressions. The clever emendation of Bernays would mean: “when mud holds the soul,” [c dimgray]i.e.[/c] when the soul is moist, and therefore (on Heracleitean principles) dull and stupid.

	V. Many do not interpret aright such things as they encounter, nor do they have knowledge of them when they have learned, though they seem to themselves so to do.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	H. seems to be referring to ([c dimgray]a[/c]) the correct apprehension of phenomena and ([c dimgray]b[/c]) the difference between unintelligent learning and understanding.

	VI. Knowing neither how to listen nor how to speak.

	VII. If you do not expect it, you will not find out the unexpected, as it is hard to be sought out and difficult.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Heracleitus is laying stress upon the importance of the constructive imagination in scientific enquiry—what the early Christians might have called “faith.”

	VIII. Gold-seekers dig much earth to find a little gold.

	IX. Critical discussion.

	X. Nature is wont to hide herself.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	φύσις is not necessarily an abstraction here, but merely the truth about the Universe. It is easy, however, to see why the Stoics could maintain that their pantheism was founded on Heracleitus. See Fragments XIX, XCI, XCII.

	XI. The Lord whose is the oracle in Delphi neither declares nor hides, but sets forth by signs.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	In this and the preceding H. seems to be calling attention to his oracular style, which was in part due to the strong religious emotion of his age. There is much that is oracular in Aeschylus and Pindar.

	XIII. The things that can be seen, heard and learnt, these I honour especially.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This and the following two fragments emphasise the importance of personal research, as contrasted with learning from authority. Bywater’s punctuation would make the meaning to be: “Am I to value highly those things that are learnt by sight or hearing?”—an attack upon the accuracy and value of the senses. But H. does not distrust the senses, but only sense impressions interpreted in a stupid way.

	XIV. Particularly at the present time, when all places can be reached by water or by land, it would not be right to use as evidence for the unknown the works of poets and mythologists, as in most things our predecessors did, proving themselves, as Heracleitus has it, unreliable supporters of disputed points.

	XV. Eyes are more accurate witnesses than ears.

	First-hand information is better than hearsay.

	As is plain from the following fragment, this is an attack on confusing second-hand information with true understanding and education. It is unfair to the mathematical achievements of Pythagoras and scarcely does justice to the theological acumen of Xenophanes, to say nothing of his wonderful

	XVII. Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, practised research more than any other man, and choosing out these writings claimed as his own a wisdom that was only much learning, a mischievous art.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	An attack on book-learning that is merely the acquisition of second-hand information. Diels rejects the fragment as spurious, chiefly because it makes Pythagoras a writer of books. But the reading ἐποιήσατο for ἐποίησεν does away with this objection.

	XVIII. Of all those whose discourses I have heard, not one attains to this, to realise that wisdom is a thing apart from all.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This has been interpreted to mean that true wisdom is attained by none, or that general opinions do not contain real wisdom.

	XIX. Wisdom is one thing—to know the thought whereby all things are steered through all things.

	That is, to understand the doctrine of opposites and of perpetual change.

	XX. This world, which is the same for all, was made neither by a god nor by man, but it ever was, and is, and shall be, ever-living Fire, in measures being kindled and in measures going out.

	The use of κόσμος to mean “world” is Pythagorean, μέτρα refers to the approximate correspondence between the things that are becoming fire and the things that are coming out of fire. The balance of nature is not disturbed by perpetual flux.

	XXI. The transformations of Fire are, first, sea; of sea half is earth and half fiery storm-cloud.

	fire. On the earth is the sea, above the sea is the sun. Sea is half composed of earth transforming itself to water and half of fiery cloud, the latter representing water on its way to become fire. This explanation of πρηστήρ I owe to Burnet.

	XXII. All things are exchanged for Fire and Fire for all things, even as goods for gold and gold for goods.

	XXIII. It is melted into sea, and is measured to the same proportion as before it became earth.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The subject is γῆ, and the whole fragment means that along the “road up” the proportion of the “measures” remains constant. The amount of earth in the universe remains approximately the same, because the “measures” of water turning to earth equal the “measures” of earth turning to water.

	XXIV. Want . . . surfeit.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray]E.g.[/c] the “want” of earth for water to increase it equals the “surfeit” of earth which makes some of it turn to water.

	XXV. Fire lives the death of air, and air lives the death of Fire; water lives the death of earth, earth that of water.

	XXVI. Fire when it has advanced will judge and convict all things.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For the “advances” of fire see περὶ διαίτης I, Chap. III. Such statements as the one above led the Stoics to develop their theory of ἐκπύρωσις, the destruction of all things periodically by fire, to be followed by a re-birth and restoration of all things.

	XXVII. How can you hide from that which never sets?

	XXVIII. The thunderbolt steers all things.

	XXIX. The sun will not overstep his measures; otherwise the Erinyes, helpers of Justice, will find him out.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	The “boundary of bright Zeus” is, according to Diels, the South Pole. Burnet takes it to be the horizon, and the whole passage a protest against the Pythagorean view of a southern hemisphere.

	XXXI. If there were no sun, there would be night, in spite of the other stars.

	XXXII. The sun is new every day.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This is because of the perpetual flux. One sun is extinguished at sunset; another is kindled at sunrise.

	XXXIII. Thales is supposed by some to have been the first astronomer and the first to foretell the eclipses and turnings of the sun, as Eudemus declares in his account of astronomical discoveries. For this reason both Xenophanes and Herodotus pay him respectful honour, and both Heracleitus and Democritus bear witness to him.

	XXXIV. So time, having a necessary connection and union with the firmament, is not motion merely, but, as I have said, motion in an order having measure, limits and periods. Of which the sun, being overseer and warder, to determine, judge, appoint and declare the changes and seasons, which, according to Heracleitus, bring all things, is a helper of the leader and first God, not in trivial or small things, but in the greatest and most important.

Euripides says that “the parched earth is in love with rain,” and that “high heaven, with rain fulfilled, loves to fall to earth.” And Heracleitus says that “the opposite is beneficial,” and that “from things that differ comes the fairest attunement,” and that “ail things are born through strife.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Burnet thinks that there is a reference to the medical theory of “like is cured by unlike” in the first of these quotations from Heracleitus (τὸ ἀντίξουν συμφέρον). See also Stewart on Aristotle, [c dimgray]Eth. Nic.[/c] 1104, [c dimgray]b[/c]16.

	XLVII. The invisible attunement is superior to the visible.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This apparently means that the attunement of opposites in the natural world is a superior “harmony” to that which we hear from musical instruments, ἁρμονία means “tune” rather than “harmony.”

	LIII. Dry dust also and ashes must be placed near the walls wherever the porch or roof protects the chicken-run, that the birds may have a place to sprinkle themselves; for with these things they improve their plumage and wings, if only we believe Heracleitus the Ephesian, who says: “pigs wash in mud and barnyard fowls in dust (or ash).”

	LV. Every creature is driven to pasture with blows.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The reading τὴν γῆν, preferred by Zeller and Pfleiderer, will refer to the “crawling creatures” (worms) which feed on earth. But cf. Aeschylus, [c dimgray]Agamemnon[/c] 358 and Plato, [c dimgray]Critias[/c] 109 b, καθάπερ ποιμένες κτήνη πληγῇ νέμοντες. See Diels in [c dimgray]Berl. Sitzb.[/c] 1901, p. 188. Men do not know what is good for them, and have to be forced to it.

	LVI. The attunement of the world is of opposite tensions, as is that of the harp or bow.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	See Fragment XLV.

	LVII. Good and bad are the same.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This refers ([c dimgray]a[/c]) to a thing being good for some and bad for others; ([c dimgray]b[/c]) to goodness and badness being two aspects of the same thing.

	LVIII. Goodness and badness are one. At any rate doctors, as Heracleitus says, cut, burn, and cruelly rack the sick, asking to get from the sick a fee that is not their deserts, in that they effect such benefits † in sickness. †
	[m1]\ [/m]
	With ἐπαιτιῶνται the meaning is: “complain that the patients do not give them an adequate return.” See Plato, [c dimgray]Republic[/c] VI, 497b.

	LIX. Couples are wholes and not wholes, what agrees disagrees, the concordant is discordant. From all things one and from one all things.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The reading συνάψειας could be taken as a potential optative without ἄν. Burnet renders συμφερόμενον διαφερόμενον “what is drawn together and what is drawn asunder,” and takes all three pairs to be explanatory of συνάψιες.

	LX. Men would not have known the name of Justice were it not for these things.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	That is, justice is known only through injustice.

	LXI. They say that it is unseemly that the sight of wars delights the gods. But it is not unseemly, for noble deeds delight them. Wars and fighting seem to our thoughtlessness (?) terrible, but in the sight of God even these things are not terrible. For God makes everything contribute to the attunement of wholes, as he dispenses the things that benefit, even as Heracleitus says that to God all things are fair and good and just, but men have supposed that some things are unjust, other things just.

	LXII. We must know that war is common to all and that strife is justice, and that everything comes into being by strife and . . .

	The corrupt χρεώμενα has been emended to καταχρεώμενα, to φθειρόμενα and κρινόμενα, but no reading commends itself as really probable.

	LXIII. For there are things foreordained wholly.

	LXIV. Whatsoever things we see when awake are death, just as those we see in sleep are slumber.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Diels thinks that the original went on to say that “what we see when dead is life.” The road up and down has three stages, Fire, Water, Earth, or, Life, Sleep, Death.

	LXV. The one and only wisdom is both unwilling and willing to be spoken of under the name of Zeus.

	“Unum illud principium mundi est materia causa lex regimen. Ζεύς, Δίκη, σοφόν, λόγος: varia nomina, res non diversa.

Gr.[/c] § 40, note [c dimgray]a.[/c] This is admirably said, and puts a great deal of Heracleitus’ teaching into three sentences.

	LXVII. Immortal mortals, mortal immortals, one living the others’ death and dying the others’ life.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For the sake of symmetry in English I have translated τεθνεῶτες rather inaccurately. Being perfect in tense it strictly means “being dead,” [c dimgray]i.e.[/c] their being dead is the others’ life.

	LXVIII. For it is death to souls to become water, and death to water to become earth. But from earth comes water, and from water, soul.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The best commentary on this is Aristotle, [c dimgray]de Anima[/c] I. 2, 405[c dimgray]a[/c], 25: καὶ ‘Ηράκλειτος δὲ τὴν ἀρχὴν εἶναί φησι ψυχήν,
	εἴπερ τὴν ἀναθυμίασιν, ἐξ ἧς τἆλλα συνίστησιν.

	LXIX. The road up and the road down is one and the same.

	LXX. The beginning and end are common.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Heracleitus is referring to a point on the circumference of a circle.

	LXXI. The limits of soul you could not discover though you journeyed the whole way, so deep a measure it has.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Burnet renders λόγον “measure,” as in Fragment XXIII.

	LXXII. It is delight to souls to become moist.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Perhaps because the change to moisture means death, and the rest of death is pleasant. Or, the way down to death is really a way to the joy of a new life. Or (finally), the passage cannot be altogether without a reference to the τέρψις of intoxication. See the next fragment.

	LXXIII. A man when he has become drunk is led by a mere stripling, stumbling, not knowing where he walks, having his soul moist.

	LXXIV. A dry soul is wisest and best.

	LXXV. Dry light is the wisest and best soul.

	LXXVI. Where earth is dry, the soul is wisest and best.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For LXXV and LXXVI see notes on the text.

	LXXVII. Man, like a light in the night, is kindled and put out.

	LXXVIII. For when is death not within our selves? And as Heracleitus says: “Living and dead are the same, and so are awake and asleep, young and old. The former when shifted are the latter, and again the latter when shifted are the former.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Burnet takes the metaphor in μεταπέσοιτα to be the moving of pieces from one γραμμὴ of the draught-board to another.

	LXXIX. Time is a child playing draughts; the kingship is a child’s.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Cf. Homer, [c dimgray]Iliad [/c] XV. 362:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	ὡς ὅτε τις ψάμαθον πάϊς ἄγχι θαλάσσης,
	ὅς τ᾿ ἐπεὶ οὖν ποιήσῃ ἀθύρματα νηπιέῃσιν,
	ἂψ αὖτις συνέχευε ποσὶν καὶ χερσὶν ἀθύρων.
	The changes of time are like the changes of the child’s game.

	LXXX. I searched my self.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	See Ritter and Preller, § 48. Possibly it means: “I inquired of myself, and did not trust others.” See Fragments XV-XVIII. Some see a reference to γνῶθι σεαυτόν, and it is possible that Heracleitus gave a new meaning to this old saying. But Pfleiderer’s theory, that H. sought for the τέλος in introspection, is a strangely distorted view.

	LXXXI. Into the same rivers we step and do not step; we are and we are not.

	LXXXVIII. The number thirty is one most intimately bound up with nature, as it bears the same relation to tens as three does to units. Then again the cycle of the moon is composed of the numbers 1, 4, 9, 16, which are the squares of the first four numbers. Wherefore Heracleitus hit the mark when he called the month (or moon) a generation.

	LXXXIX. In thirty years a man may become a grandfather.

	The Fragments LXXXVI-LXXXIX refer to the “cycle of life.” The circle is complete when the son himself becomes a father.

	On Politics and Ethics
	XC. We all work together to one end, some wittingly and with understanding, others unconsciously. In this sense, I think, Heracleitus says that even sleepers are workers and co-operators in the things that take place in the world.

	XCI. Thought is common to all. Men must speak with understanding and hold fast to that which is common to all, as a city holds fast to its law, and much more strongly still. For all human laws are nourished by the one divine law. For it prevails as far as it wills, suffices for all, and there is something to spare.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“The common” will be fire, which is the one true wisdom. So men who have understanding must “keep their souls dry” and refuse to cut themselves off from the great principle of the universe by letting their souls grow moist. See Introduction, p. 457. Passages like this were eagerly seized upon by the Stoics when they elaborated their theory of a great κοινὸς λόγος animating the universe. True virtue, they held, was for a man consciously and lovingly to follow this λόγος, which is really the will of God, and to try to associate himself with it. What is crude and imperfect in Heracleitus became mature and complete in Stoicism. Christianity seized upon this thought, and developed the λόγος doctrine of St. John and the early Fathers.

	XCII. Therefore one must follow the common. But though the Word is common, the many live as though they had a wisdom of their own.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Burnet thinks that τοῦ λόγου δ᾿ ἐόντος ξυνοῦ does not belong to Heracleitus, appealing to the MSS. reading δὲ ὄντος in support of his contention. He is chiefly influenced by his conviction that λόγος can mean only the message or gospel of Heracleitus. But at this early stage in the history of thought there could be no distinction made between ([c dimgray]a[/c]) the message and ([c dimgray]b[/c]) the truth which the message tries to explain. It is the latter meaning that I think λόγος has in this passage.

	XCV. Heracleitus says that there is one world in common for those who are awake, but that when men are asleep each turns away into a world of his own.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Sleepiness to Heracleitus was the state of a man who allowed his soul to sink on the downward path into moisture or mud. See Fragments XCI and XCII. To be awake was to have one’s soul dry, and to be in close connection with “the ever-living fire” of the universe.

	XCVIII. And does not Heracleitus too, whom you bring forward, say this very same thing, that the wisest of men compared with God will appear as an ape in wisdom, in beauty and in everything else?

	XCIX. Sir, you do not know that the remark of Heracleitus is a sound one, to the effect that the most beautiful of apes is ugly in comparison with another species, and that the most beautiful of pots is ugly in comparison with maidenhood, as says Hippias the wise.

	Burnet so translates θυμός; the word covers a wider area than any English equivalent, but includes much of what we include under “instinct,” “urge,” “passionate craving.” Aristotle understood θυμὸς to mean anger ([c dimgray]Ethic.

	CVI. It is the concern of all men to know themselves and to be sober-minded.

	CVII. To be sober-minded is the greatest virtue, and wisdom is to speak the truth and to act it, listening to the voice of nature.

	These two fragments (both are of doubtful authenticity) express positively what is stated in Fragment CV in a quasi-negative form.

	CIX. To hide ignorance is preferable to bringing it to light.

	CX. It is law too to obey the advice of one.

	CXI. For what mind or sense have they? They follow the bards and use the multitude as their teacher, not realising that there are many bad but few good. For the best choose one thing over all others, immortal glory among mortals, while the many are glutted like beasts.

	CXII. In Priene lived Bias, son of Teutamas, who is of more account than the others.

	CXIII. One man to me is as ten thousand, if he be the best.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Fragments CXI–CXIII show the aristocratic tendencies of the mind of Heracleitus. His “common,” of course, has nothing to do with “common-sense” or with general opinions. It refers to the law or principle of nature, which each man must apprehend for himself. He who can do so best is a natural leader and lawgiver.

	CXIV. All the Ephesians from the youths up would do well to hang themselves and leave their city to the boys. For they banished Hermodorus, the best man of them, saying, “We would have none among us who is best; if there be such an one, let him be so elsewhere among other people.”

	CXV. Dogs also bark at him they know not.

	CXVI. He escapes being known because of men’s unbelief.

	“A prophet is not without honour save in his own city.”

	CXXVII. For if it were not to Dionysus that they made procession and sang the phallic hymn, it would be a most disgraceful action. But Hades is the same as Dionysus, in whose honour they rave and keep the feast of the vat.

	CXXVIII. I distinguish, therefore, two kinds of sacrifices. First, that of men wholly cleansed, such as would rarely take place in the case of a single individual, as Heracleitus says, or in the case of very few men. Second, material and corporeal sacrifices, arising from change, such as befit those who are still fettered by the body.

	CXXIX. Cures (atonements).

	CXXX. When defiled they purify themselves with blood, just as if one who had stepped in mud were to wash himself in mud.

	\[3\] In the end he became a misanthrope and withdrew, passing his time in the mountains and eating herbs and plants. But when he came down with dropsy because of this, he returned to the city and asked the doctors, with a riddle, whether they were capable of changing a rainstorm into a drought; they did not understand, so he buried himself in an ox stall, hoping that he would be dried out by the warmth of the manure. But he did not achieve anything in this way either, and he died at the age of sixty \[cf. P1\]. \[. . .\] \[4\] Hermippus says that he asked the doctors whether it was possible to reduce his intestines and their moisture by drying them out; when they said it was not, he placed himself in the sunlight and told his slaves to smear him with cow dung. Stretched out in this way, he died the next day and was buried in the agora. Neanthes of Cyzicus says that he stayed there because he could not tear off the cow dung himself and that, since he was unrecognizable because of his transformation, he was eaten by dogs. \[. . .\] \[5\] But Sotion says \[. . .\] that Ariston says in his [c dimgray]On Heraclitus[/c] that he was cured of his dropsy too but died of a different disease; and Hippobotus says the same thing.

	Regarding the knowledge of things that are evident, humans are fooled in the same way as Homer, who was wiser than all the other Greeks. For boys who were killing lice fooled him by saying, “The ones we see and grasp, we leave behind; the ones we do not see or grasp, we take away.”

	Heraclitus criticizes the poet \[i.e. Homer\] who wrote, “If only strife would vanish from gods and men!” ([c dimgray]Il.[/c] 18.107): for there would not be any harmony ([c dimgray]harmonia[/c]) if there were not high-pitched and low-pitched, nor would there be any animals without female and male, which are opposites.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	The fact that eclipses \[scil. occur\] on the day of the new moon is made clear by Aristarchus of Samos, who writes, “\[. . .\] Heraclitus \[scil. says\]: ‘When the months meet, it \[i.e. the moon\] changes during the days following its appearance—the first day on the new moon, the second—sometimes during fewer ones \[scil. days\], sometimes during more.’”

	Those who speak with their mind ([c dimgray]xun noôi[/c]) must rely ([c dimgray]iskhurizesthai[/c]) on what is in common ([c dimgray]xunôi[/c]) for all, just as a city does on its law, and much more strongly ([c dimgray]iskhuroterôs[/c]) \[scil. than a city\]. For all human laws are nourished by one law, the divine one: for it dominates as much as it wants to, and it suffices for all, and there is some left over.

	In general, what is written should be easy to read and easy to pronounce \[. . .\]. This is a feature lacking in \[. . .\] writings that are difficult to punctuate, like Heraclitus’. For it is hard work to punctuate Heraclitus’ statements because it is unclear with what \[scil. a given term\] is connected, with what follows or what precedes, as in the beginning of his book: for he says, “And of this account that is always humans are uncomprehending” \[cf. D1\], and it is unclear if “always” is to be punctuated so as to go with the one or the other.

	R7 (< A4) Demetrius, [c dimgray]On Style[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Clarity depends \[. . .\] on connecting particles. For a whole that is asyndetic and unconnected is completely devoid of clarity, for in the absence of connection it is unclear where each phrase begins, as in Heraclitus’ writings; and in fact it is usually the absence of connection that makes these obscure.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	\[. . .\] which \[i.e. not being understood\] can come about in two ways without being blameworthy: either if you produce this intentionally, like Heraclitus, “who is called ‘Obscure’ because he wrote very obscurely on nature”;[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] or when it is caused by the obscurity of the subject matter, not of the language \[. . .\].

	hours, then all days must necessarily be equal, inasmuch as the night contains what the day loses. But another one said that one day is equal to all the others from the point of view of resemblance, because the extent of the very longest time contains nothing which you could not find in a single day—that is, light and night \[. . .\].

	R13 (cf. B30) Simplicius, [c dimgray]Commentary on Aristotle’s [/c]On the Heavens

	Heraclitus says that the world sometimes undergoes a conflagration and sometimes is reconstituted again out of the fire, following certain periods of time, when he says, “kindled in measures and extinguished in measures” \[cf. D85\]. \[. . .\] And Heraclitus, who expresses his wisdom by means of enigmas, is not signifying either \[i.e. besides Empedocles\] what most people think he means. For in any case having said this about the generation of the world, as it seems, he has also written the following: “this world order, none of the gods or humans made it, but it always was” \[cf. D85\]. Except that Alexander, who wants Heraclitus to say that the world is generated and perishable, now understands “world” differently. He says, “He does not say anything contradictory, as someone might suppose; for he does not mean by ‘world’ here the organization of this world, but in general the things that exist and their arrangement, in virtue of which the change of the whole takes place alternately in both directions, sometimes into fire, sometimes into this world. For this sort of alternation in the changes of these things and this sort of world did not ever begin, but always existed.”

	My view about them \[scil. interpolated texts in works by Hippocrates\] is that an ill-intentioned person appended these texts to the writings of Hippocrates, seeking to shame and disgrace those miserable sophists, so that their ignorance would be revealed, just as one of our contemporaries named Lucian[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] has done. \[2\] For he forged a book in which he collected obscure words that have no meaning at all, and then attributed it to Heraclitus. He then gave it to some people who presented it to a philosopher whose utterances were well regarded and whom people found to be truthful and trustworthy. They asked him to explain it and comment on it for them. But this poor man did not realize that they only wanted to mock him. So, thinking himself to be extremely clever, he began to deliver expositions on the book, but brought disgrace upon himself as a result.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	  That, my dear Theodorus, is just why we must examine it all the more, and from \[179e\] the beginning, just as they themselves present it.[c darkmagenta][b]\[Theodorus:\][/b][/c]
	  Absolutely. For, about these Heraclitisms or, as you say, these Homerisms and other ideas that are even more ancient \[cf. DOX. T2\], it is just as impossible to converse with those Ephesians who profess to be experts in them, as it is with lunatics. For, honestly, their behavior is entirely in accordance with their writings, and they are not at all capable of sticking with the argument and the question, or of calmly answering and asking in turn; \[180a\] indeed, the absence of even the smallest bit of calmness in them exceeds this ‘not at all.’ But if you ask one of them something, they draw enigmatic little phrases as though from a quiver and shoot them; and if you try to get an explanation of what he has said, you will be hit by another unheard-of phrase. You will never get anywhere with any of them—nor, for that matter, do they with one another,

	  By the dog, I think that it was a pretty good inspiration that occurred to me just now: that the very ancient men who established names, like many of the present-day philosophers, more than anything got dizzy because of the intense whirling they were subjected to when they attempted to investigate the condition of the things that are, and that because of this they suppose that things are whirling around and moving in all ways possible. But they say that the cause for this opinion is not the internal affection that they feel but the fact that the nature of things is such that none of them is at rest or stable, but that they are flowing, are being borne along, and are always full of every kind of motion and generation.

	Furthermore, observing that all this \[i.e. perceptible and indeterminate\] nature is in motion, and that “true” cannot be said about anything that is changing, \[scil. they thought\] that it is evidently not possible to say something true about what is changing completely in every way.

	Why, if one eats garlic, does the urine smell, whereas when other things that have a strong odor are eaten, it does not smell? Is it, as some of the Heraclitizers say, that an evaporation takes place, just as in the universe, so too in the body, and that, when it has cooled off again, moisture forms there and urine here? \[. . .\]

	This \[scil. because the sun attracts the lighter elements of a liquid\] is why the upper parts \[scil. of the sea\] are also warmer \[scil. besides being salty\]; for salty \[scil. water\] is warmer than potable. And that is why some of the Heraclitizers say that stones and earth are produced from the drying out and solidifying of potable water and that the sun is an evaporation coming from the sea.

It is quite absurd to say that a harmony ([c dimgray]harmonia[/c]) “diverges,” or is made up of elements that still diverge.

And in general, if what he states is true, then this statement itself (I mean that the same thing can be and not be at one and the same time) would not be true. For just as if they are taken separately, the affirmation is no more true than the negation, in the same way if there is a single affirmation of their conjunction and combination, the negation will not be more true than the whole statement taken as an affirmation. And furthermore, if one cannot affirm anything truly, then this affirmation itself, according to which there is no such thing as a true affirmation, would be false. And if anything can be, then what those people say who raise this kind of objection and completely destroy discussion would be refuted.

	That is why too those who cite others’ opinions, for example that the good and the evil are the same thing, as Heraclitus said, do not concede that the contraries are not present at the same time in the same thing, not because this is not their own opinion, but because this is what one must say according to Heraclitus.

	things come about by contrariety and the totality of things flows like a river \[cf. D65–D66\]. The whole is limited and there is only one world \[cf. D85\]. It is generated out of fire and it burns up again \[i.e. it becomes fire\] according to certain periods \[cf. D85\], alternating, for the whole duration of time. And this comes about according to destiny. Of the contraries, the one that leads to generation is called war and strife \[cf. D63, D64\], the one that leads to the conflagration ([c dimgray]ekpurôsis[/c]), agreement and peace \[cf. D48, D49\], and the changing is a way upward and downward \[cf. D51\], and it is according to this that the world comes about. \[9\] For as the fire becomes dense, it becomes moist, and when it collects together it becomes water, and when the water becomes solid it turns into earth \[cf. D86\]. And this is the downward way. But then in turn the earth spreads out and from it comes water \[cf. D86\], and from this comes everything else, since he derives almost everything from the evaporation from the sea; and this is the upward way. But there are evaporations that come from the earth and sea, some of them bright and pure, others dark. The fire increases because of the bright ones, the moisture because of the others. He does not explain what surrounds. But there are in it bowls turned over with their concave part facing us, in which bright evaporations that are pressed together produce flames, which are the heavenly bodies. \[10\] The brightest and hottest flame is that of the sun. For the other heavenly bodies are farther away from the earth and that is why they produce less light and heat; the moon is closer to the earth but does not move through the pure region. But the sun

Eclipses of the sun and moon occur when the bowls are turned upward; the monthly phases of the moon come about when the bowl turns around on itself little by little. Day, night, months, the seasons of the year, rainy years, winds, and similar phenomena come about because of different evaporations. \[11\] For the bright evaporation makes day when it is kindled in the circle of the sun, but when the contrary one prevails it produces night. And heat, increased by the bright one, makes summer, while moisture, made preponderant by the dark one, generates winter. He supplies the causes for other phenomena as well, along the same lines. But as for the earth, he does not explains what it is, nor about the bowls either. And these were his opinions.

	Concerning the soul, Cleanthes, citing the doctrines of Zeno in order to establish a comparison with the other philosophers of nature, says that Zeno defines the soul as an evaporation endowed with sensation, like Heraclitus; for, wanting to show that the souls that come from an evaporation are always intelligent, he has compared them to rivers, when he says, \[. . . = D65a\].

	Heraclitus, with the approval of the Stoics, connects our reason with the divine reason that rules and governs the affairs of the world: being made conscious of the law of reason because of this inseparable connection, when our souls are resting it announces the future with the help of the senses. This is how it comes about that the images of unknown places and the likenesses of both living and dead men appear. And the same man defends the practice of divination and \[scil. claims\] that those who are deserving are forewarned by divine powers that instruct them.

	\[127\] \[. . .\] this natural philosopher \[i.e. Heraclitus\] holds the view that the substance that surrounds us is rational and mindful. \[. . .\] \[129\] So according to Heraclitus, it is by inhaling this divine reason when we breathe that we become intelligent, and whereas we forget it when we sleep, we become mindful again when we are awake. For when we sleep, the channels of perception are closed and the mind within us is separated from its natural connection with what surrounds, and only the point of attachment, respiration, subsists like a kind of root, and when it is separated it loses the faculty of memory that it had before; \[130\] but then when it awakens, leaning toward the channels of perception as though toward windows and encountering what surrounds, it takes on the faculty of reason once again. In the same way as pieces of charcoal brought near to a fire are kindled according to a transformation but are extinguished when they are removed from

	it, so too the portion coming from what surrounds, which resides with our bodies, in the state of separation becomes almost irrational, but in the state of union by most of the channels it is restored to its affinity with the whole. \[131\] Heraclitus says that this reason, which is in common and divine, and by participation in which we become rational, is the criterion of the truth; this is why what appears to all in common is reliable (for it is apprehended by the reason that is common and divine), while what is evident to one man alone is unreliable, for the opposite reason. \[132\] For this is what the abovementioned man says at the beginning of his book [c dimgray]On Nature[/c] \[or: of his remarks about nature\], when in a certain way he is indicating what surrounds: “Of this account that is \[. . .\] just as they forget all they do while they are asleep” \[= D1\]. \[133\] After he has indicated explicitly in these words that it is by participation in divine reason that we do and think everything, a little later he adds that therefore we ought to follow what is in common (for [c dimgray]xunos[/c] \[i.e. the Ionic term\] means “in common”): “But although the account is in common, most people live as though they had their own thought” \[= D2\]. This is nothing other than an explanation of the way in which the whole is organized \[. . .\].

	But those \[scil. Stoics\] of yours, Balbus, have the habit of referring everything to the force of fire, following, I suppose, Heraclitus, whom they do not all interpret in the same way. But since he did not wish what he said to be understood, let us leave him aside.

	For Heraclitus said that all things come from a limited fire and that all things are resolved back into it. The Stoics too would be of this opinion. For the conflagration ([c dimgray]ekpurôsis[/c]) makes an enigmatic allusion to something of this sort, and they say that every body is limited.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]

	Heraclitus says that the world sometimes undergoes a conflagration and sometimes reconstitutes itself again out of the fire, following certain periods of time, when he says, “kindled in measures and extinguished in measures” \[cf. D85\]. Later, the Stoics too came to share this opinion.

	but also for all other philosophers and for all human beings \[. . .\]. \[212\] But perhaps the Skeptical school not only does not make a contribution to the knowledge of Heraclitus’ philosophy, but it even leads away from it, since the Skeptic rejects all of Heraclitus’ dogmatic affirmations as rash and opposes the conflagration ([c dimgray]ekpurôsis[/c]), opposes the thesis that, concerning the same thing, the contraries exist, disparages the dogmatic rashness of all of Heraclitus’ doctrines, and asserts “I do not apprehend” and “I define nothing,” as I said earlier. All of this is opposed to the Heracliteans. And it is absurd to say that an opposing school is a path leading to the very doctrine that it opposes; so that it is absurd to say that the Skeptical school is a path leading to Heraclitus’ philosophy.

But he refutes perception, saying in his own words, \[. . . = D33\], which doubtless means the same thing as, “It belongs to barbarian souls to trust irrational perceptions.” \[127\] But the reason that he indicates as judge of the truth is not just

	But one must know that the parts of this world are divided into two as well, and established as opposites. The earth \[scil. is divided\] into mountainous areas and flat ones. And water into sweet and salt; the sweet is the potable one, which springs and rivers bring forth; and the salt is seawater. And the weather into winter and summer, and again into spring and autumn. And starting from this, Heraclitus wrote the book on nature; which \[scil. he wrote\] having learned from the theologian \[i.e. Moses\] the ideas about the opposites, and having added to it an infinity of laborious arguments.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]

	The literal meaning \[scil. of this verse, Gen. 25:8\] does not cause any difficulty; but it is necessary to consider it in a more natural sense and give the following answer, namely that the death of this body is the life of the soul, since the soul lives its own incorporeal life. On this topic Heraclitus too, stealing the law and the opinion from Moses, like a thief, says, “We live their death and die their life” \[cf. D70\], thus suggesting that the life in this body is the death of the souls, while what is called ‘death’ is the most glorious and primary life, that of the soul.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	b (≠ DK) Philo, [c dimgray]Allegories of the Sacred Laws[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	\[107\] When he \[i.e. Moses\] says, “to die by death” \[cf. Gen. 2:17\], notice that he is taking death as a punishment, not as the one that happens by nature; the one that happens by nature is the one by which the soul is separated from the body, whereas the one that is a punishment happens when the soul dies for the life of virtue and lives only for the life of vice. \[108\] And Heraclitus did well to follow the doctrine of Moses on this point, for he says, “we live their death and we die their life” \[cf. D70\], on the idea that now, while we are alive, our soul has died and is buried in the body as though in a tomb, but that if we die, then the soul lives its own life and is freed from the evil, dead body to which it was attached.

	\[213\] Magnificently, then, the interpreter of the things of nature, feeling pity for our sloth and carelessness, teaches us generously every time, as he does now, the antithetical position of each of the things that are deprived of wholeness and result from divisions: for what is one is formed out of one and the other of contraries, and it is by its division that the contraries are known. \[214\] Is this not what the Greeks say that the great Heraclitus, much besung among them, put forward as the chief point of his philosophy and boasted as though it were a new discovery? Yet in fact it is a very ancient discovery by Moses that the contraries have come from the same thing and have the status of things divided \[. . .\].

	I would not accept Heraclitus, who says, “I have taught myself” \[cf. D36\], because he is self-taught and arrogant; and I would not praise him either for having mysteriously hidden his poem in the temple of Artemis so that it would be published only later \[cf. P13\]. For those people who study these matters say that the tragedian Euripides went there and read it, and, having memorized it little by little, eagerly transmitted Heraclitus’ obscurity \[cf. R5a\]. Death confuted this man’s ignorance: for when he came down with a dropsy, he practiced medicine like philosophy and smeared himself with cow dung; and when the dung hardened and caused contractions in his whole body, he died in convulsions \[cf. P16–P17\].

D86\]. The same applies in a similar way to the other elements.

For those who sleep sleep at night, and those who get drunk get drunk at night. But we, who belong to the day, let us stay sober, having donned the corselet of faith and love and as a helmet the hope of salvation” \[1 Thess. 5:6–8\]. \[141.1\] And the same things as they say about sleep must also be understood about death. For both indicate the departure of the soul, the latter more, the former less—which can also be seen in Heraclitus. \[2\] “A human being, in the night, \[. . .\] awake he touches on a sleeping man” \[= D71\]. \[3\] For “blessed are those who know the right moment,” according to the Apostle, “for it is time for you to awaken from your sleep; for our salvation is now closer than it was when we acquired our faith. The night is far gone, the day is near. So let us put aside the works of darkness, and let us don the weapons of light” \[Rom. 13:11–12\]. \[4\] By “day” and “light” he is allegorically indicating the Son, and by “the weapons of light” he is metaphorically indicating the precepts.

	he was a disciple not of Christ but of Heraclitus. For this is how he says that the created world is the craftsman and creator of itself: “God: day night, winter summer, war peace, satiety hunger.” (all the contraries, this is the meaning) “He changes just as <fire>, when it is mixed together with incense, is named according to the scent of each one” \[= D48\].

	\[9\] It is clear to all that even if you were to say that Noetus’ thoughtless ([c dimgray]anoêtous[/c]) successors and the heads of his heresy were not pupils of Heraclitus themselves, nonetheless by embracing Noetus’ doctrines they were evidently subscribing to these same theses. For this is what they say: that one and the same god is the craftsman and the father of all things, and that, although invisible, he consented in the beginning to reveal himself to the just. \[10\] For when he is not seen, he is invisible; <when he is seen, he is visible;> immobile when he does not wish to move, but mobile when he moves; thus in the same way invincible and vanquished, ungenerated <and generated>, immortal and mortal. How <then> will men of this sort not reveal themselves to be disciples of Heraclitus, even if the Obscure, the first man to have adopted this philosophy, did not express himself in this way, but in his own words?

	Heraclitus maintains that those who have been killed in war are worthy of being fully honored: for he says, “Gods and humans honor those men whom Ares has slain” \[= D122a\]; and again: “Greater deaths \[[c dimgray]moroi[/c]\] obtain greater portions \[[c dimgray]moirai[/c]\]” \[= D122b\]. \[40\] But I myself do not accept this idea: for very many people have lived a depraved life and then suffered a violent death. \[. . .\] \[41\] \[. . .\] So it is not all those “whom Ares has slain” who ought to be honored according to Heraclitus, but only those who have joyously accepted death in the service of piety; for in truth it is only they, according to him, who are the “greater” ones. And because of this they enjoy “greater portions,” those who not only receive honors from all human beings in this life but also await eternal garlands. And I admire greatly this other saying of Heraclitus: “What awaits humans after they have died is everything that they do not expect nor suppose” \[= D120\].

	Since nature begins everywhere from difference, they \[scil. the ancients\] have given everywhere as a symbol for it the two-gated entrance. For the way passes either by the intelligible or by the perceptible; and regarding the intelligible, either through the sphere of fixed stars or through that of the planets, and again either through the immortal passage or through the mortal one. And there is one center above the earth, another below it, and one to the east, and another to the west; and some things are to the left, others to the right, and there is night and day.
