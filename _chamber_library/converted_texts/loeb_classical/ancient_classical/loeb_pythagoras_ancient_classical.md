	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Instead of Euclid’s term ἀρτιάκις περισσός, Nicomachus,
	Theon and Iamblichus used the single word ἀρτιοπέριττος.
	According to Nicomachus ([c dimgray]Arith. Introd[/c]. i. 9) such
	a number, when divided by 2, leaves an odd number as
	the quotient, [c dimgray]i.e.[/c], it is of the form 2(2[c dimgray]n[/c]+1). In this later
	subdivision an [c dimgray]odd-even[/c] (περισσάρτιος) number is one which
	can be halved twice or more successively, but the final
	quotient is always an odd number and not unity, [c dimgray]i.e.[/c], a
	number of the form 2[c dimgray][sup]P+1[/sup][/c] (2[c dimgray]n[/c]+1). We thus have three
	mutually exclusive classes of even numbers: (1) [c dimgray]even-even,[/c] of
	the form 2[c dimgray][sup]P[/sup][/c]; (2) [c dimgray]even-odd[/c], of the form 2(2[c dimgray]n[/c]+1); and (3) [c dimgray]odd-even,[/c]
	of the form 2[c dimgray][sup]P+1[/sup][/c](2[c dimgray]n[/c]+1), where (1) and (3) are extremes
	and (2) partakes of the nature of both. The [c dimgray]odd-odd[/c] is not
	defined by Nicomachus and Iamblichus, but according to a
	curious usage in Theon it is one of the names applied to prime
	numbers, for these have two odd factors, 1 and the number
	itself.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]According to this definition, any even-times odd number
	would also be odd-times even. The definition appears to
	have been known to Iamblichus, but there can be little doubt that it is an interpolation. If both definitions are genuine, one is not only pointless but the enunciations of ix. 33 and ix. 34 become difficult to understand, and were, indeed, read differently by Iamblichus from what we find in our mss. We have to choose between accepting Iamblichus’s reading in all three places and rejecting Def. 10 as interpolated. I agree with Heiberg ([c dimgray]Euklid-Studien[/c], pp. 198 [c dimgray]et seq[/c].) that the definition was probably interpolated by someone who was unaware of the difference between the Euclidean and the later Pythagorean classifications, but noticed the absence of a definition by Euclid of an odd-times even number and tried to supply one.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]be odd and prime. The classification is defective, as (2) includes
	(3). Another defect is that the term [c dimgray]composite[/c] is
	restricted to odd numbers instead of being given, as by Euclid,
	its general signification. For an earlier and different use of
	the terms by Speusippus, see [c dimgray]infra,[/c] p. 78 n. a. Euclid’s definition of prime and composite numbers differs greatly from the classification of Nicomachus ([c dimgray]Arith. Introd[/c]. i. 11–13) and Iamblichus. To match the three classes of even numbers, they devised three classes of odd numbers: (1) πρῶτον καὶ ἀσύνθετον, [c dimgray]prime and incomposite[/c], which is a prime number in the Euclidean sense; (2) δεύτερον καὶ σύνθετον, [c dimgray]secondary and composite[/c], which appears to be the product of prime numbers; and (3) ὃ καθ᾿ ἑαυτὸ μὲν δεύτερον
	καὶ σύνθετον, πρὸς ἄλλο δὲ πρῶτον καὶ ἀσύνθετον, [c dimgray]that which is secondary and composite in itself, but prime and incomposite
	in relation to another[/c], where all the factors must

	[b]From Philolaus’s book [c dimgray]On the Universe[/c] . . .[/b]
	“Number is of two special kinds, odd and even, with a third, even-odd,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] arising from a mixture of both; and of each kind there are many forms, which each thing exhibits in itself.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Nicomachus, [c dimgray]Introduction to Arithmetic[/c] i. 7, ed. Hoche 13. 7–14. 12
	Number is a determinate multitude or collection of units or flow of quantity made up of units, and the first division of number is into the even and odd. Now the even is that which can be divided into two equal parts, without a unit inserting itself in the middle, while the odd is that which cannot be divided into two equal parts owing to the unit inserting itself as aforesaid.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] This is the definition commonly accepted; but according to the Pythagoreans an even number is that which is divided, by one and the same operation, into the greatest and the least parts, greatest in size but least in quantity,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] in accordance with a natural reciprocity of the two species, while an odd number cannot be so divided but is only divisible into two unequal parts. There is another ancient way of defining an even number

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The “even-odd” would seem to mean here the product
	of odd and even numbers. This agrees with Euclid’s usage
	in [c dimgray]Elem[/c]. vii. Def. 9. For the later specialized Pythagorean
	meaning, see [c dimgray]supra,[/c] p. 68 n. a.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]If an odd number is set out as 2[c dimgray]n[/c]+1 units in a straight
	line, then it can be divided into two sections of [c dimgray]n[/c] units measured from either end, with a single unit left over in the middle; but an even number of [c dimgray]2n[/c] units can be divided into two equal sections with no unit left over in the middle.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c][c dimgray]i.e.[/c] into two halves, for there cannot be any part greater than half nor fewer parts than two.

	even, just as 1 was not regarded as a number, but the principle

	seems clearly to be a later addition to the original definition.
	It must, however, have been pre-Platonic, for in [c dimgray]Parm.[/c] 143 d
	Plato speaks of 2 as even. Aristotle, who adds ([c dimgray]Topics[/c] Θ 2,

	and he compiled a neat little book which he entitled [c dimgray]On the Pythagorean Numbers[/c]. From the beginning up to half way he deals most elegantly with linear and polygonal numbers and with all the kinds of surfaces and solids in numbers; with the five figures which he attributes to the cosmic elements,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] both in respect of their special properties and in respect of their similarity one to another; and with proportion and reciprocity.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] After this he immediately devotes the other half of the book to the decad, showing it to be the most natural and most initiative of realities, inasmuch as it is in itself (and not because we have made it so or by chance) an organizing idea of cosmic events, being a foundation stone and lying before God the Creator of the universe as a pattern complete in all respects. He speaks about it to the following effect.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“Ten is a perfect number, and it is both right and according to Nature that we Greeks and all men arrive at this number in all kinds of ways when we count, though we make no effort to do so; for it has many special properties which a number thus perfect ought to have, while there are many characteristics which, while not special to it, are necessary to its perfection.

	“Next it is necessary that the prime and incomposite and the secondary and composite[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] should be equal; now they are equal in the case of 10, and in the case of no other number which is less than 10 is this true, though numbers greater than 10 having this property (such as 12 and certain others[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]) can soon be found, but their base is 10. As the first number with this property and the least of those possessing it 10 has a certain perfection, and it is a property peculiar to itself that it is the first number in which the incomposite and the composite are equal.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“In addition to this property it has an equal number of multiples and submultiples of those multiples; for it has as submultiples the numbers up to 5, while those from 6 to 10 are multiples of them; since 7 is a multiple of no number, it has to be omitted, but 4 must also be dropped as a multiple of 2, and so this brings about equality once more.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]One of the most noteworthy features of this passage is
	the early use of the terms πρῶτοι καὶ ἀσύνθετοι ([c dimgray]prime and
	incomposite[/c]), δεύτεροι καὶ σύνθετοι ([c dimgray]secondary and composite[/c]),
	for which see [c dimgray]supra,[/c] p. 69 n. [c dimgray]c[/c]. The use is different from
	that of Nicomachus and Iamblichus. It seems that [c dimgray]prime
	and incomposite[/c] numbers are prime numbers in the ordinary
	sense, including 2, as is the case with Euclid and Aristotle
	([c dimgray]Topics[/c] Θ 2, 157 a 39). [c dimgray]Secondary and composite[/c] numbers are all composite numbers, the term not being limited to odd numbers as with Nicomachus. There is no suggestion of a third mixed class. The two equal classes according to Speusippus are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 4, 6, 8, 9, 10. According to the later terminology the [c dimgray]prime and incomposite[/c] numbers would be 3, 5, 7, while the only [c dimgray]secondary and composite[/c] number would be 9.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Actually 10, 12 and 14 are the only numbers possessing this property.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]In the series 1, 2 . . . 10 the submultiples are 1, 2, 3, 5 and the multiples are 6, 8, 9, 10. It is curious that though 1 is counted as a submultiple, all the other numbers are not counted as multiples of it; to have admitted them as such would have destroyed the scheme.

	and the remaining varieties are in it,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and so are the linear and plane and solid numbers. For 1 is a point, 2 is a line, 3 is a triangle and 4 is a pyramid; all these are elements and principles of the figures like to them. In these numbers is seen the first of the progressions, that in which the terms exceed by an equal amount, and they have 10 for their sum.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] In surfaces and solids these are the elements—point, line, triangle, pyramid. The number 10 exhibits them and possesses perfection. For 4 is to be found in the angles or faces of a pyramid, and 6 in the sides,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] so making 10; again 4 is to be found in the intervals and extremities of the point and line, while 6 is in the sides and angles of a triangle,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] so as again to make 10. This also comes about in figures regarded from the point of view of number.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] For the first triangle is the equilateral, which has one side and angle; I say one
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Speusippus asserts that among the numbers 1, 2 . . . 10
	all the different kinds of ratio can be found. The [c dimgray]super-particular[/c]
	ratio is the ratio of the whole + an aliquot fraction,
	<img class="glyph" alt="Mathematical Example" [s]LCL335-p80-g1.png[/s] typified by the ratio known as ἐπίτριτος, or 4/3.
	Tannery sees here an allusion to the ten kinds of proportion
	outlined by Nicomachus (see [c dimgray]infra,[/c] pp. 114–124), and a proof
	of their ancient origin.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c][c dimgray]i.e.[/c], 1, 2, 3, 4 from an arithmetical progression having
	1 as the common difference and 10 as the sum.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c][c dimgray]i.e.,[/c] a pyramid has 4 angles (or 4 faces) and 6 sides, and
	so exhibits the number 10.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]The reasoning is not very clear. Taking first a line and
	a point outside it, Speusippus notes that the line has 2 extremities
	and between the point and these 2 extremities are 2 intervals. This gives the number 4. A triangle has
	3 sides and 3 angles, giving the number 6. Combining the point, the line and the triangle we thus get 10.
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]A very difficult passage follows, but Tannery seems successfully to have unravelled its meaning. There seems to be here, he notes, an ill-developed Pythagorean conception. The point or monad is necessarily simple. The line is a dyad with two species, straight and curved. The triangle is a triad with three kinds. The pyramid is a tetrad with four kinds. Clearly the three species of triangle are the equilateral, the isosceles and the scalene, where the number of different elements are respectively 1, 2, 3. Speusippus does not consider isosceles and scalene triangles in general, but takes particular cases, and it is worthy of note that the three triangles he considers are used in the [c dimgray]Timaeus[/c] of Plato.
	By analogy, the pyramids can be divided into four kinds: (1) all solid angles equal; (2) three solid angles equal; (3) two solid angles equal; (4) all solid angles unequal. Here again Speusippus takes special cases, but he goes astray by giving the second class a square base, and has to force the analogy.

	because they are equal; for the equal is always indivisible and uniform. The second triangle is the half-square; for with one difference in the sides and angles it corresponds to the dyad. The third is the half-triangle, which is half of the equilateral triangle; for being completely unequal in every respect, its elements number three. In the case of solids, you would find this property also, but going up to four, so that the decad is reached in this way also. For the first pyramid, which is built upon an equilateral triangle, is in some sense unity, since by reason of its equality it has one side and one face; the second pyramid, which is raised upon a square, has the angles at the base enclosed by three planes and that at the vertex by four, so that from this difference it resembles the dyad. The third resembles a triad, for it is set upon a half-square; together with the one difference that we have seen in the half-square as a plane figure it presents another corresponding to the angle at the vertex; there is therefore a resemblance between the triad and this pyramid, whose vertex lies on the perpendicular to the middle of the hypotenuse[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of the base. In the same way the fourth, rising upon a half-triangle as base, resembles a tetrad, so that the aforesaid figures find completion in the number 10. The same result is seen in their generation. For the first principle of magnitude is point, the second is line, the third is surface, the fourth is solid.”[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	Furthermore certain numbers are called [c dimgray]perfect[/c], some [c dimgray]over-perfect[/c], others [c dimgray]deficient[/c]. Perfect numbers are those that are equal to their own parts, such as 6; for its parts are the half 3, the third 2 and the sixth 1, which added together make 6. Perfect numbers are produced in this manner. If we take successive double numbers starting from the unit and add them until a prime and incomposite number is found, and then multiply the sum by the last of the added terms, the resulting number will be perfect.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For example, let the doubles be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. We therefore add together 1 and 2; the result is 3; and we multiply 3 by the last of the added terms, that is by 2; the result is 6, which is the first perfect number. Again, if we add together three doubles in order, 1 and 2 and 4, the result will be 7; and we multiply this by the last of the added terms, that is, we multiply 7 by 4; the result will be 28, which is the second perfect number. It is composed out of its half 14, its fourth part 7, its seventh part 4, its fourteenth part 2 and its twenty-eighth part 1.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Over-perfect numbers are those whose parts added together are greater than the wholes, such as 12; for the half of this number is 6, the third is 4, the fourth is 3, the sixth is 2 and the twelfth 1, which added together produce 16, and this is greater than the original number, 12.

	Deficient numbers are those whose parts added together make a number less than the one originally

The same property is shown by 10, which the Pythagoreans called perfect for a different reason, and this we shall discuss in the proper place. The number 3 is also called perfect, since it is the first number which has a beginning and middle and end. It is moreover both a line and a surface, for it is an equilateral triangle in which each side is two units, and it is the first bond and power of the solid; for in three dimensions is the solid conceived.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]There were in use among the Greeks two ways of representing
	numbers geometrically. One, used by Euclid and
	implied in Plato, [c dimgray]Theaetetus[/c] 147 d—148 b (see [c dimgray]infra[/c], p. 380), is
	to represent numbers by straight lines proportional in length
	to the numbers they represent. If two such lines are made
	adjacent sides of a rectangle, then the rectangle represents
	their product; if three such lines are made sides of a
	rectangular parallelepiped then the parallelepiped is the
	product. The other way of representing numbers was by
	dots or alphas for the units disposed along straight lines
	so as to form geometrical patterns, a method greatly developed
	by the Pythagoreans. Any number could be represented
	as a straight line, and prime numbers only as could be used for telling the time; it was later used of an

	"Mathematical example." [s]LCL335-p88-f1.png[/s]
	instrument for drawing right angles).
	The first number after 1 which can be represented as a
	pentagon is 5. If it be represented as ABCDE, then we can
	form another pentagon AB´C´D´E, equivalent to 10, by adding
	the “gnomon of the pentagon,” a row of an extra 7 dots
	arranged round three of the sides of the original pentagon.
	The gnomons to be added to form the successive pentagonal
	numbers 1, 5, 12, 22 . . . are respectively 4, 7, 10 . . ., or
	the successive terms of an arithmetical progression having
	3 as the common difference. In the case of the hexagon the
	successive gnomonic numbers differ by 4, and in general, if
	[c dimgray]n[/c] is the number of sides in the polygon, the successive
	gnomonic numbers differ by [c dimgray]n[/c]–2. straight lines, whence Thymaridas spoke of them as “rectilinear [c dimgray]par excellence[/c]” (Plato would have represented a prime number such as 7 by 7 x 1, an oblong). The unit, being the source of all number, can be taken as a triangle, a pentagon, a hexagon, and so on. The first number after 1 which can be represented as a triangle is 3, and the sum of the first [c dimgray]n[/c] natural numbers can always be represented as a triangle; the adjoining figure, a famous Pythagorean symbol, shows how this is done for 1+2+3+4=10.

	"Mathematical example." [s]LCL335-p87-f1.png[/s]
	Square numbers can be represented in similar fashion, and the square of side [c dimgray]n[/c]+1 can be obtained from the square of side [c dimgray]n[/c] by adding a gnomon of [c dimgray]2n[/c]+1 dots round the side (the term “gnomon” originally signified an upright stick which cast shadows on a plane or hemispherical surface, and so So much for plane numbers. There are similar varieties of solid numbers (cubes, pyramids, truncated pyramids, etc.). The curious reader will find the whole subject treated exhaustively by Nicomachus ([c dimgray]Arith. Introd[/c]. ii. 7–20), Theon of Smyrna (ed. Hiller 26–42) and Iamblichus ([c dimgray]in Nicom. Arith. Introd.[/c], ed. Pistelli 58. 7 [c dimgray]et seq.[/c]). It is of importance for the student of Greek mysticism, but has little interest for the modern mathematician.

Adding a unit to this it makes the resulting number the hypotenuse.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For example, starting from 3 and squaring, the method obtains 9; a unit is subtracted, making 8, and the half of 8 is taken, making 4; to this a unit is added, giving 5, and in this way there is found a right-angled triangle having as its respective sides 3, 4 and 5.

This is probably what Aristotle refers to, but he does not indicate that the starting-point is in one case 1 and in the other 2; and the interpretation is modern, Themistius and Simplicius having other (and less attractive) explanations. The subject is fully discussed by W. D. Ross in his notes [c dimgray]ad loc.[/c] ([c dimgray]Aristotle’s Physics[/c], pp. 542–544).

	you please and adding them one to another you will make the whole into a square, and whatsoever square you split up you will be able to make two triangles from it.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Again, a triangle joined to any square figure makes a pentagon; for example, when the triangle 1 is added to the square 4 it makes the pentagon 5, and when the next triangle in order, which is plainly 3, is joined to 9, the next square, it makes 12, while 6, the next successive triangle, added to 16, the next successive square, will yield 22, the next successive pentagon, and 10 added to 25 will make 35, and so on without limit. In the same way if the triangles are added to the corresponding pentagons, they will produce the hexagons in an orderly series, and the triangles linked with them in turn will give the heptagons in order, and after them the octagons, and so on to infinity.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] To help the memory let the various polygonal numbers be written out in parallel rows, the first consisting of triangles, the next of squares, the next after these of pentagons, then of hexagons, then of heptagons, then, if it is so desired, of the other polygonal numbers in order.

	[b]Iamblichus, [c dimgray]On Nicomachus’s Introduction to Arithmetic[/c], ed. Pistelli 62. 10–18[/b]
	Now in the representation of the polygons two of the sides always remain the same but are produced, while the sides intercepted between them are continually changed when the gnomons are placed round, one being changed in the triangle, two in the square, three in the pentagon and so on to infinity, the difference between the designation of the polygons and the number of sides changed being two.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c][c dimgray]i.e.,[/c] the principle will be made clear from the figures for
	the gnomons of the square and pentagon given on pp. 86–89
	n. [c dimgray]a.[/c] The general formula is that in a polygon of [c dimgray]a[/c] sides, the
	number of sides changed to form the next highest polygon is [c dimgray]a[/c]– 2. (This leads Iamblichus to introduce immediately Thymaridas’s rule for solving [c dimgray]n[/c] simultaneous equations, as the factor [c dimgray]a[/c]– 2 occurs in this also. For this rule see [c dimgray]infra[/c], pp. 138–141).
	From Iamblichus’s account it follows that the successive gnomons to a polygon of [c dimgray]a[/c] sides are
	1, 1+([c dimgray]a[/c]-2), l+2([c dimgray]a[/c]-2), . . . 1+([c dimgray]r[/c]-1)([c dimgray]a[/c]-2),
	and the [c dimgray]a[/c]-gonal number of side [c dimgray]n[/c] is the sum of n terms of this series, or
	[c dimgray]n[/c] + ½[c dimgray]n[/c]([c dimgray]n[/c] − 1)([c dimgray]a[/c] −2).

	The method of obtaining these[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] is called by Eratosthenes a sieve, since we take the odd numbers mixed together and indiscriminate, and out of them by this method, as though by some instrument or sieve, we separate the prime and incomposite by themselves, and the secondary and composite by themselves, and also find those that are mixed. The nature of the sieve is as follows: I set forth in as long a column as possible all the odd numbers, beginning with three, and, starting with the first, I examine which numbers in the series it will measure, and I find it will measure the numbers obtained by passing over two intermediate numbers, so far as we care to proceed, not measuring them at random and by haphazard, but it will measure the number first found by this process, that is, the one obtained by passing over two intermediate numbers, according to the magnitude of the number lying at the head of the column, that is, according to the magnitude of itself; for it will measure it thrice.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] It will measure the number
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Nicomachus has been discussing the different species of
	odd numbers, which are explained above on p. 69 n. [c dimgray]c.[/c]
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]That is, Eratosthenes, for whom see p. 156 n. [c dimgray]a[/c], set out
	the odd numbers beginning with 3 in a column. For convenience
	we will set them out horizontally as follows:
	3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35. We now strike out from this list the multiples of 3, because they will not be prime numbers, and this is done by passing over two numbers at a time and striking out the next. That is, we pass over 5 and 7 and strike out 9, we pass over 11 and 13 and strike out 15, and so on without limit. As Nicomachus notes in a rather cumbrous way, the numbers struck out, 3, 9, 15, 21, 27 . . ., when divided by 3 gives us in order the numbers in the original column 3, 5, 7, 9 . . . . There is here the foundation for a logical theory of the infinite, but it was left for Russell and Whitehead to develop it.

	[b]Theon of Smyrna, ed. Hiller 35. 17–36. 2[/b]
	It is a property of squares to be divisible by three, or to become so divisible after subtraction of a unit; likewise they are divisible by four, or become so divisible after subtraction of a unit; even squares that after subtraction of a unit are divisible by three
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The numbers obtained by passing over four numbers are
	15, 25, 35 . . .
	and can all be divided by 5, leaving
	3, 5, 7 . . .
	which is the original series of odd numbers.
	Nicomachus proceeds to pass over six numbers at a time,
	beginning from 7, but we need not follow him. Clearly in
	this way he will eventually be able to remove from the series
	of odd numbers all that are not prime. The general formula
	is that we obtain all multiples of a prime number [c dimgray]n[/c] by skip- ping [c dimgray]n[/c]–1 terms at a time. But to make sure that any odd number [c dimgray]2n[/c]+1 left in the series is prime we should have to try to divide it by all the prime numbers up to √2̅[c dimgray]n̅[/c]+̅1̅ and the method is not a practicable way of ascertaining whether any large number is prime.

	When the odd numbers beginning with one are set out in succession [c dimgray]ad infinitum[/c] this property can be noticed, that the first makes a cube, the sum of the next two after it makes the second cube, the next three following them make the third cube, the next four succeeding these make the fourth cube, the next five in order after these makes the fifth cube,

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Any number may be written as 3[c dimgray]n[/c], 3[c dimgray]n[/c]± 1 or 3[c dimgray]n[/c]± 2, and
	its square takes the form
	9[c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] or 9[c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] ± 6[c dimgray]n[/c] + 1 or 9[c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] ± 12[c dimgray]n[/c] + 4.
	In the first case, the square is divisible by three; in the
	second and third cases it becomes so divisible after subtraction
	of a unit. As for division by four, the square of an even number [c dimgray]2n[/c] is necessarily divisible by 4. The square of an odd number 2n±1 may be written 4n[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]±4n+1 and becomes divisible by four after subtraction of a unit. Karpinski observes ([c dimgray]Nicomachus of Gerasa[/c], by M. L. D’Ooge, p. 58): “Apparently Theon desired to divide all square numbers into four classes, viz., those divisible by three and not by four; by four and not by three; by three and four; and by neither three nor four. In modern mathematical phraseology all square numbers are termed congruent to 0 or 1, modulus 3, and congruent to 0 or 1, modulus 4. This is written:
	<ul class="simple">
	<li>[c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=1 (mod. 3),
	<li>[c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=0 (mod. 3),
	<li>[c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=0 or 1 (mod. 4).
	“This is the first appearance of any work on congruence which is fundamental in the modern theory of numbers.”

	{[c dimgray]n[/c]([c dimgray]n[/c] - 1) + 1} + {[c dimgray]n[/c]([c dimgray]n[/c] - 1) + 3} + . . . + {[c dimgray]n[/c]([c dimgray]n[/c] - 1)} + 2[c dimgray]n[/c] - 1} = [c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c].
	By putting [c dimgray]n[/c] = 1, 2, 3 . . . [c dimgray]r[/c] in this formula and adding the
	results it is easily shown that
	1[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] + 2[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] + 3[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] + . . . + [c dimgray]r[/c][c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] = {½[c dimgray]r[/c]([c dimgray]r[/c] + 1)}[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c],
	a formula which was known to the Roman [c dimgray]agrimensores[/c] and
	probably to Nicomachus. Heath ([c dimgray]H.G.M.[/c] i. 109–110) shows
	how it was proved by the Arabian algebraist Alkarkhī in a
	book [c dimgray]Al-Fakhrī[/c] written in the tenth or eleventh century.
	The proof depends on Nicomachus’s theorem.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Iamblichus has been considering various groups of
	three numbers which can be formed from the series of natural
	numbers, by passing over a specified number of terms, so as
	to become polygonal numbers. Thus 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 (triangle),
	1 + 3 + 5 = 9 (square), 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 (pentagon), 1 + 4 + 7 = 12
	(pentagon), 1 + 5 + 9 = 15 (hexagon).
	10 + 20 + 30 + . . . 100 + 90 + 80 + . . . 30 + 20 + 10 = 10[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]
	100 + 200 + 300 + . . . 1000 + 900 + 800 + . . . 300 + 200 + 100
	= 10[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]
	and so on. It was in virtue of these relations that the Pythagoreans
	spoke of 10 as the [c dimgray]unit of the second course[/c] (δευτεροδουμένη
	μονάς), 100 as the [c dimgray]unit of the third course[/c] (τριωδουμένη
	μονάς) and so on. As Iamblichus had previously explained ([c dimgray]in Nicom[/c]., ed. Pistelli 75. 25—77. 4), the Pythagoreans looked upon a square number [c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] as a race course (δίαυλος) formed of successive numbers from 1 (as the [c dimgray]start[/c], ὕσπληξ up to [c dimgray]n[/c] (the [c dimgray]turning point[/c], καμπτήρ) and back again through ([c dimgray]n[/c]– 1), ([c dimgray]n[/c]– 2), and so on to 1 (as the [c dimgray]goal[/c], νύσσα), in this way:
	<img class="glyph" alt="Mathematical Example" [s]LCL335-p107-g1.png[/s]
	As an example we have
	1+2+3+ . . . 10+9+8+ . . . 3+2+1=10[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	and thence
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]In other words, Iamblichus asks us to consider any group of three consecutive numbers, the greatest of which is divisible by 3. We may represent such a group generally as 3[c dimgray]p[/c]+1, 3[c dimgray]p[/c]+2, 3[c dimgray]p[/c]+3.

	was called the unit of the third course and 1000 the unit of the fourth course. Now 4, 5, 6 make the number 15. Reducing the 10 to a unit, and adding it to the 5 we get 6. Again, 7, 8, 9 when added together make the number 24, in which I reduce the 20 to two units, add them to the 4 and so again have 6. Once more, adding 10, 11, 12, I make 33, in which the 30 yields 3, and adding this to the 3 units I likewise have 6, with a similar result in all cases. The first 6 does not suffer a change of the 10 into a monad, being a kind of image and element of those that succeed it. The second has a change of one monad, the third of two, the fourth of three, the fifth of four and so on in order. The number of 10 s that have to be changed is also the number of 9 s that have to be taken away from the whole sum in order that the result may likewise be 6. In the case of 15, where there is one 10 to be changed, if I take away one 9 the remainder will be 6. In the case of 24, where there are two 10 s to be changed, if I take away two 9 s the remainder will again be 6, and this will happen in all cases.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The truth of Iamblichus’s proposition is proved generally
	by Loria ([c dimgray]Le scienze esatte nell’ antica Grecia[/c], pp. 841–842)
	in the following manner.
	Let | N = [c dimgray]n[/c]<sub>0</sub> + 10[c dimgray]n[/c]<sub>1</sub> + 10[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c][c dimgray]n[/c]<sub>2</sub> + . . . Now, if N is the sum of three consecutive numbers of which
	the greatest is divisible by 3, we can write
	N=(3[c dimgray]p[/c]+1)+(3[c dimgray]p[/c]+2)+(3[c dimgray]p[/c]+3),
	and the above congruence becomes
	9[c dimgray]p[/c]+6=N΄(mod. 9)
	so that N΄ ≡ 6(mod. 9), with the condition N΄ ≦ 9. But the
	only number ≦ 9 which is divisible by 6 is 6 itself.
	Therefore | N΄=6. be a number written in the decimal system. Let S(N) be the sum of its digits, S[c dimgray][sup](2)[/sup][/c](N) the sum of the digits of S(N), and so on.
	Now N-S(N)=9(n<sub>1</sub>+11n<sub>2</sub>+ . . .)
	whence N≡S(N) (mod. 9).
	Similarly S(N)≡S[c dimgray][sup](2)[/sup][/c]N(mod. 9)
	and so on.
	Let S[c dimgray][sup](k-1)[/sup][/c](N)≡S[c dimgray][sup](k)[/sup][/c]N(mod. 9)
	be the last possible relation of this kind; S[c dimgray][sup](k)[/sup][/c]N will be a number N´≦9.
	Adding all the congruences we get
	N≡N´ (mod. 9), where N´≦9.

	[b]Iamblichus, [c dimgray]On Nicomachus’s Introduction to Arithmetic[/c], ed. Pistelli 100. 19–25[/b]
	In ancient days in the time of Pythagoras and the mathematicians of his school there were only three
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]It is generally believed that the Pythagoreans were
	aware of the irrationality of √2̅ (Theodorus, for example,
	when proving the irrationality of numbers began with √3̅),
	and that Aristotle has indicated the method by which they
	proved it. The proof, interpolated in the text of Euclid as x. 117 (Eucl., ed. Heiberg-Menge iii. 408–410), is roughly as follows. Suppose AC, the diagonal of a square, to be commensurable with its side AB, and let their ratio in its smallest terms be [c dimgray]a[/c]: [c dimgray]b[/c].
	Now AC[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]: AB[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=[c dimgray]a[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]: [c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	and AC[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=2AB[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c], [c dimgray]a[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] =2[c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c].
	Hence [c dimgray]a[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c], and therefore [c dimgray]a[/c], is even.
	Since [c dimgray]a: b[/c] is in its lowest terms it follows that [c dimgray]b[/c] is odd.
	Let [c dimgray]a[/c]=2[c dimgray]c[/c]. Then 4[c dimgray]c[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=2[c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c], or [c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=2[c dimgray]c[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c], so that [c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c], and therefore [c dimgray]b[/c] is even.
	But [c dimgray]b[/c] was shown to be odd, and is therefore odd and even, which is impossible. Therefore AC cannot be commensurable with AB.

The geometric mean is that in which the first term is to the second as the second is to the third. Here the greater terms make the same interval as the lesser.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] The subcontrary mean, which we call harmonic, is such that by whatever part of itself the first term exceeds the second, the middle term exceeds the

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]It is easily seen how the Pythagoreans would have
	observed the three means in their musical studies (see A. E.
	Taylor, [c dimgray]A Commentary on Plato’s Timaeus[/c], p. 95). They
	would first have noticed that when they took three vibrating
	strings, of which the first gave out a note an octave below the
	second, while the second gave out a note an octave below the
	third, the lengths of the strings would be proportional to
	4, 2, 1. Here the διάστημα is in each case an octave. The
	Pythagoreans would then have noticed that if they took three strings sounding a given note, its major fourth and its upper octave, the lengths of the strings would be proportional to 12, 8, 6, which are in harmonic progression. Finally they would have observed that if they took three strings sounding a note, its major fifth and its upper octave, the lengths of the strings would be proportional to 12, 9, 6, which are terms in arithmetical progression. But the fact that the means are consistently given in the order arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, and that the name “harmonic” was substituted by Archytas for the older name “subcontrary” suggests that these means had already been arithmetically defined before they were seen to be exemplified in the fundamental intervals of the octave.

	for the ratios formed are both seen to be the double.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] It is clear in what way this mean is contrary to the harmonic; for whereas they both have the same extremes, standing in the double ratio, in the case of the former mean this was also the ratio of the difference of the greater terms towards that of the lesser, while in the case of the present mean it is the ratio of the difference of the lesser terms to that of the greater.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] This property peculiar to the present mean deserves to be known, that the product of the greater and middle terms is double the product of the middle and least terms, for six times five is double five times three.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	The next two means, the fifth and sixth, were both fashioned after the geometric, and differ from each other in this way.

	What makes it subcontrary to the geometric mean is this property, that in the case of the geometric mean the middle term bears to the lesser the same ratio as the excess of the greater term over the middle bears to that of the middle term over the lesser, while in the case of this mean a contrary relation holds.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]This is one of a series of propositions given by Pappus to
	the following effect. If A, B, Γ are three terms in geometric
	proportion, it is possible to form from them three other terms
	Δ, Ε, Ζ, being linear functions of Α, Β, Γ, which satisfy the
	different proportions. In this case Δ, Ε, Ζ are also in geometric
	proportion, but in the other examples Δ, Ε, Ζ are
	made to satisfy the harmonic, the subcontrary, and the fifth,
	sixth, eighth, ninth and tenth means of Pappus’s list. The
	problems are, of course, problems in indeterminate analysis
	of the second degree. Pappus does not include solutions for
	the arithmetic and seventh proportions. Tannery ([c dimgray]Mémoires
	scientifiques[/c] i., pp. 97–98) suggests as the reason that in these
	cases the equations of the proportions, Δ+Ζ=2E and,
	Δ=Ε+Ζ, are already linear, there is no need to assume that AΓ=B[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c], and consequently there is one indeterminate too many. But the complete results are shown in the table reproduced on these pages from Pappus (ed. Hultsch, p. 102, with explanation, pp. 100–104). The first column in the Greek table gives the means which Δ, E, Z are to satisfy. The second column gives the number of times A, B, Γ have to be taken to form Δ, E, Z respectively. In the case of the geometric progression already considered, the table shows that to form Δ we have to take A once, B twice and Γ once; to form e we have to take B once and Γ once; and to form z we take Γ once. The third column gives the least integral values of Δ, e, z satisfying the respective proportions ([c dimgray]i.e.[/c] the values of Δ, E, Z, supposing A, B, Γ to be each unity); in the case of the geometric proportion the values are 4, 2, 1.

	Archytas’s proof that a superparticular ratio cannot be divided into equal parts.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A superparticular ratio[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] cannot be divided into equal parts by a mean proportional[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] placed between. That will later be more conclusively proved. For the proof which Archytas gives is very loose. It is after this manner. Let there be, he says, a superparticular ratio [c dimgray]A[/c]: [c dimgray]B[/c].[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] I take [c dimgray]C, D[/c]+[c dimgray]E[/c] the least numbers in the same ratio.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] Therefore, since [c dimgray]C, D[/c]+[c dimgray]E[/c], are the least numbers in the same ratio and are superparticulars, the number [c dimgray]D[/c]+[c dimgray]E[/c] exceeds the number [c dimgray]C[/c] by an aliquot part of itself and of [c dimgray]C.[/c] Let the excess be [c dimgray]D[/c].[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] I say that [c dimgray]D[/c] is not a number but a unit.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]In other words, one mean is sufficient to connect in

	required to connect cube numbers. Plato’s remarks are
	equivalent to saying that

	beginning of all things, must have it in its capacity to be both side and diameter. Now let there be added to the side a diameter and to the diameter two sides, for as often as the square on the diameter is taken once, so often is the square on the side taken twice. The diameter will therefore become the greater and the side will become the less. Now in the case of the first side and diameter the square on the unit diameter will be less by a unit than twice the square on the unit side; for units are equal, and 1 is less by a unit than twice 1. Let us add to the side a diameter, that is, to the unit let us add a unit; therefore the \[second\] side will be two units. To the diameter let us now add two sides, that is, to the unit let us add two units; the \[second\] diameter will therefore be three units. Now the square on the side of two units will be 4, while the square on the diameter of three units will be 9; and 9 is greater by a unit than twice the square on the side 2.

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]In algebraical notation, a pair of [c dimgray]side[/c]- and [c dimgray]diameter[/c]-
	numbers, [c dimgray]a[/c]<sub>n,</sub> [c dimgray]d[/c]<sub>n</sub> are such that
	 d<sub>n</sub>[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] − 2 a<sub>n</sub>[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] = ±1,
	and the law for the formation of any pair of such numbers
	from the preceding pair is
	[c dimgray]d[/c]<sub>n</sub> = 2[c dimgray]a[/c]<sub>n-1</sub> + [c dimgray]d[/c]<sub>n-1</sub>
	[c dimgray]a[/c]<sub>n</sub> = [c dimgray]a[/c]<sub>n-1</sub> + [c dimgray]d[/c]<sub>n-1.</sub>
	The general proof of the property of these numbers is not
	given by Theon (doubtless as being well known). It can be
	exhibited algebraically as follows:
	<img class="glyph" alt="Mathematical Example" [s]LCL335-p136-g2.png[/s]
	by similar reasoning, and so on. Starting with [c dimgray]a[/c]<sub>1</sub>=1,[c dimgray]d[/c]<sub>1</sub>=1
	as the first pair of side and diameter numbers, we have
	[c dimgray]d[/c]<sub>1</sub>[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] - 2[c dimgray]a[/c]<sub>1</sub>[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] = - 1
	and therefore by the above equation we have
	[c dimgray]d[/c]<sub>2</sub>[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] - 2[c dimgray]a[/c]<sub>2</sub>[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] = + 1,
	[c dimgray]d[/c]<sub>3</sub>[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] - 2[c dimgray]a[/c]<sub>3</sub>[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] = - 1,
	and so on, the positive and negative signs alternating. The values of the first few pairs in the series are, as Theon correctly indicates,
	(1, 1), (2, 3), (5, 7), (12, 17),
	the last giving, for example, the equation
	17[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]–2.12[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=289–288=+l.
	It is clear that the successive side- and diameter-numbers are rational approximations to the sides and hypotenuses of increasing isosceles right-angled triangles (hence the name), and therefore that the successive pairs give closer approximations to √2̅, namely
	1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, etc.,
	and this suggests one reason why the early Greek mathematicians were so interested in them.
	The series was clearly known before Plato’s time, for in the famous passage about the geometrical number ([c dimgray]Republic[/c] 546 c) he distinguishes between the [c dimgray]rational[/c] and the [c dimgray]irrational[/c] “diameter of five.” In a square of side 5, the diagonal or diameter is √5̅0̅, and this is the “irrational diameter of five”; the “rational diameter” was the integral approximation √5̅0̅−̅1̅ = 7, which we have seen above to be the third diameter number.
	In fact, since the publication of Kroll’s edition of Proclus’s commentary, the belief that these approximations are Pythagorean has been fully confirmed, as the next passage will show.

	ΑΔ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] + ΔΓ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] = 2ΑΒ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] + 2ΒΔ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c].
	If AB = [c dimgray]x[/c], ΓΔ = [c dimgray]y[/c], this gives
	(2[c dimgray]x[/c] + [c dimgray]y[/c])[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] + [c dimgray]y[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] = 2[c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] + 2([c dimgray]x[/c] + [c dimgray]y[/c])[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	or (2[c dimgray]x[/c] +[c dimgray]y[/c])[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] - 2([c dimgray]x[/c] + [c dimgray]y[/c])[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] = 2[c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] - [c dimgray]y[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c].

	equations 2[c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] - [c dimgray]y[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]= ± 1,
	then ([c dimgray]x[/c] + [c dimgray]y[/c]), (2[c dimgray]x[/c] + [c dimgray]y[/c]) are another pair of numbers satisfying
	the other equation.

	Iamblichus goes on to show how other equations can be later than the time of Plato, who lived at Paros. The name ἐπάνθημα ([c dimgray]flower[/c] or [c dimgray]bloom[/c]) given to his method shows that it must have been widely known in antiquity, though the term is not confined to this particular proposition. It is presumably used to give a sense of distinction, much as we say
	“flower of the army.” The Greek is unfortunately most obscure, but the meaning was successfully extracted by Nesselman ([c dimgray]Die Algebra der Griechen[/c], pp. 232–236), who is followed by Gow ([c dimgray]History of Greek Mathematics[/c], p. 97), Cantor ([c dimgray]Vorlesungen[/c] i[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]. 158–159), Loria ([c dimgray]Le scienze esatte nell’ antica Grecia[/c], pp. 807–809), and Heath ([c dimgray]H.G.M.[/c], i. 94–96, [c dimgray]Diophantus of Alexandria[/c], 2nd ed., pp. 114–116). The “bloom” is a rule for solving [c dimgray]n[/c] simultaneous equations connecting [c dimgray]n[/c] unknown quantities, and states in effect:
	(1) if x+x<sub>1</sub>+x<sub>2</sub>=S,
	while x+x<sub>1</sub>=s<sub>1</sub>, x+x<sub>2</sub>=s<sub>2</sub>,
	then x=s<sub>1</sub>+s<sub>2</sub>–S; reduced to this form, so that the rule “does not leave us in the lurch” (οὐ παρέλκει) in these cases.
	One of the most interesting features in this passage is the distinction between the ὡρισμένον, or known quantity, and the ἀόριστον, or unknown. This anticipates the phrase πλῆθος μονάδων ἀόριστον, “an undefined number of units,” by which Diophantus was later to describe his unknown quantity. Indeed, Thymaridas was already bordering on that indeterminate analysis which Diophantus was so brilliantly to develop; he has passed beyond the realm of strict arithmetic.

	BA[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=BM. BΓ,
	and AΓ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=ΓM. BΓ.
	Therefore BA[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]+AΓ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=BΓ (BM+ΓM)
	= BΓ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c].
	The theory of proportion developed in Euclid’s sixth book therefore offers a simple method of proving “Pythagoras’s Theorem.” This proof, moreover, is of the same type as Eucl. [c dimgray]Elem[/c], i. 47 inasmuch as it is based on the equality of the square on BΓ to the sum of two rectangles. This has suggested that Pythagoras
	proved the theorem by means of his inadequate theory of proportion, which applied only to commensurable magnitudes. When the incommensurable was discovered, it became necessary to find a new proof independent of proportions. Euclid therefore recast Pythagoras’s invalidated proof in the form here given so as to get it into the first book in accordance with his general plan of the [c dimgray]Elements.[/c]

	the angles BAΓ, BAH is right, it follows that with a straight line BA and at the point A on it, two straight lines AΓ, AH, not lying on the same side, make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; therefore ΓA is in a straight line with AH \[Eucl. i. 14\]. For the same reasons BA is also in a straight line with Aθ. And since the angle ΔBΓ is equal to the angle ZBA, for each is right, let the angle ABΓ be added to each; the whole angle ΔBA is therefore equal to the whole angle ZBΓ. And since ΔB is equal to BΓ, and ZB to BA, the two \[sides\] ΔB, BA are equal to the two \[sides\] BΓ, ZB respectively; and the angle ΔBA is equal to the angle ZBΓ. The base AΔ is therefore equal to the base ZΓ, and the triangle ABΔ is equal to the triangle ZBΓ \[Eucl. i. 4\], Now the parallelogram BΛ is double the triangle ABΔ, for they have the same base BΔ and are in the same parallels BΔ, AΛ \[Eucl. i. 41\]. And the square HB is double the triangle ZBΓ, for they have the same base ZB and are in the same parallels ZB, HΓ. Therefore the parallelogram BΛ is equal to the square HB. Similarly, if AE, BK are joined, it can also be proved that the parallelogram ΓΛ is equal to the square θΓ. Therefore the whole square ΒΔΕΓ is equal to the two squares HB, θΓ. And the square ΒΔΕΓ is described on BΓ, while the squares HB, θΓ are described on BA, AΓ. Therefore the square on the side BΓ is equal to the squares on the sides BA, AΓ.

	If we listen to those who wish to relate ancient history, we find some of them attributing this theorem to Pythagoras and saying that he sacrificed an ox upon the discovery. For my part, while I admire those who first became acquainted with the truth of this theorem, I marvel more at the writer of the [c dimgray]Elements[/c], not only because he established it by a most lucid demonstration, but because he insisted on the more general theorem by the irrefutable arguments of science in the sixth book.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	The proof by the writer of the [c dimgray]Elements[/c] being clear, I think that it is unnecessary to add anything further, and that we may be content with what has been written, since, in fact, those who have added anything more, such as Heron and Pappus, were compelled to make use of what is proved in the sixth book, with no real object.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

Proclus’s words can, however, hardly refer to this elegant theorem. Heron is known from the Arabic commentary of an-Nairīzī on Euclid’s [c dimgray]Elements[/c] (ed. Besthorn-Heiberg 175–185) to have proved that in Euclid’s figure AΛ, BK, ΓΖ meet in a point. Heron used three lemmas proved on the principles of Book i. alone, but they would more easily be proved from Book vi. It is quite likely that Proclus refers to this proof.

	[b]([c dimgray]d[/c]) The Application of Areas[/b]
	One of the greatest of Pythagorean discoveries was
	the method known as the application of areas, which
	became a powerful engine in the hands of successive
	Greek geometers. The geometer is said [c dimgray]to apply[/c]
	(παραβάλλειν) an area to a given straight line when a
	rectangle or parallelogram equal to the area is constructed
	on that straight line exactly; the area is said
	[c dimgray]to fall short[/c] or [c dimgray]be deficient[/c] (ἐλλείπειν) when the rectangle
	or parallelogram is constructed on a portion of
	the straight line; and [c dimgray]to exceed[/c] (ὑπερβάλλειν) when
	the rectangle or parallelogram is constructed on the
	straight line produced. The method is developed in
	the following propositions of Euclid’s [c dimgray]Elements[/c]:
	i. 44, 45; ii. 5, 6, 11; vi. 27, 28, 29. These proposi-

	tions are equivalent to the solution of quadratic equations, not only in particular cases but in the most general form. The application of areas (παραβολὴ τῶν χωρίων) is therefore a vital part of the “geometrical algebra” of the Greeks, who dealt in figures as familiarly as we do in symbols. This method is the foundation of Euclid’s theory of irrationals and Apollonius’s treatment of the conic sections. The subject will be introduced by Proclus’s comment on Eucl. i. 44, and then the relevant propositions of Euclid will be given, with their equivalents in modern algebraical notation. Though the precise form of the later propositions cannot be due to Pythagoras, depending as they do on a theory of proportion invented by Eudoxus, there can be no doubt, as Eudemus said, that the method goes back to the Pythagorean school, and most probably to the master himself.

	the [c dimgray]ellipse[/c], inasmuch as those god-like men of old saw the things signified by these names in the construction, in a plane, of areas upon a finite straight line. For when a straight line is set out and you lay the given area exactly alongside the whole of the straight line, they say that you apply that area; but when you make the length of the area greater than the straight line, then it is said to exceed, and when you make it less, so that when the area is drawn a portion of the straight line extends beyond it, it is said to fall short. In the sixth book Euclid speaks in this way both of exceeding and of falling short, but here he needed only the application, as he sought to apply to the given straight line an area equal to the given triangle, in order that we might have not only the construction of a parallelogram equal to the given triangle, but also its application to a finite straight line.

	Let the parallelogram BEZH be constructed, equal to the triangle Γ, in the angle EBH which is equal to Δ \[i. 42\]; and let it be placed so that BE is in a straight line with AB, and let ZH be produced to θ, and through A let Αθ be drawn parallel to either BH or EZ \[i. 31\], and let θΒ be joined. Then, since the straight line θΖ falls upon the parallels Αθ, EZ, the angles ΑθΖ, θΖΕ are equal to two right angles \[i. 29\]. Therefore the angles ΒθΗ, HZE are less than two right angles. Now the straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than two right angles will meet. Therefore θΒ, ZE, if produced, will meet. Let them be produced and let them meet at K, and through the point K let ΚΛ be drawn parallel to either EA or Ζθ \[i. 31\], and let θΑ, HB be produced to the points Λ, M. Then θΛΚΖ is a parallelogram, θΚ is its diameter, and AH, ME are parallelograms, ΛΒ, BZ the so-called complements, about θΚ. Therefore ΛΒ is equal to BZ \[i. 43\]. But BZ is equal to the triangle Γ, and therefore ΛΒ is equal to Γ \[Common Notion 1\]. And since the angle HBE is equal to the angle ABM \[i. 15\], while the angle HBE is equal to Δ, therefore the angle ABM is also equal to Δ.

Then, since the complement F9 is equal to the complement θΖ \[i. 43\], let ΔM be added to each; therefore the whole ΓΜ is equal to the whole ΔΖ.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]If the unequal segments are [c dimgray]p, q,[/c] then this theorem is
	equivalent to the algebraical proposition
	<img class="glyph" alt="Mathematical Example" [s]LCL335-p194-g1.png[/s]
	This gives a ready means of obtaining the two rules, respectively
	attributed to the Pythagoreans and Plato (see [c dimgray]supra,[/c]
	pp. 90–95) for finding integral square numbers which are the
	sum of two other integral square numbers. Putting [c dimgray]p[/c]=[c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c],
	[c dimgray]q[/c] = 1, we have
	<img class="glyph" alt="Mathematical Example" [s]LCL335-p194-g2.png[/s]
	In order that the first two squares may be integers, [c dimgray]n[/c] must
	be odd. This is the Pythagorean rule.
	Putting | [c dimgray]p[/c] = 2[c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c], [c dimgray]q[/c] = 2,
	we have ([c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] + 1)[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] - ([c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] - 1)[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] = 4[c dimgray]n[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c].
	This is Plato’s rule, starting from an even number 2[c dimgray]n[/c].
	The theorem can be made to yield a result of even greater
	interest, namely, the geometrical solution of the quadratic
	equation
	[c dimgray]ax[/c] - [c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] = [c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c],
	as is shown by Heath ([c dimgray]The Thirteen Books of Euclid’s Ele-[/c] For by the proposition (ii. 5) just proved,
	ΑΔ.ΔΒ + ΓΔ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] = ΓΒ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	| = ΟΔ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	| = ΟΓ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] + ΓΔ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] | (i. 47)
	∴ ΑΔ.ΔΒ | = ΟΓ[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	or | ([c dimgray]a[/c] - [c dimgray]x[/c])[c dimgray]x[/c] | = [c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c].
	The two points in which the circle cuts AB give two real
	solutions of the equation, which are coincident when [c dimgray]b[/c] = ½[c dimgray]a[/c]
	and the circle touches AB.
	There is no direct evidence that the Pythagoreans, or [c dimgray]ments[/c], vol. i. p. 384, and [c dimgray]H.G.M.[/c] i. 151, 152), following Simson; see also Loria, [c dimgray]Le scienze esatte nell’ antica Grecia[/c], pp. 42-45.
	If AB=[c dimgray]a[/c], ΔB=[c dimgray]x[/c],
	then the theorem shows that
	([c dimgray]a[/c]– [c dimgray]x[/c]).[c dimgray]x[/c]=the rectangle AΘ)=the gnomon MNΞ.
	If the area of the gnomon is given (=[c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]), then we have
	[c dimgray]ax[/c]– [c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=[c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]. Euclid for that matter, used this proposition to solve geometrically the quadratic equation [c dimgray]ax[/c]-[c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=[c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]. But, as will be shown below, the Pythagoreans must have solved a similar equation corresponding to ii. 11, and it may fairly safely be assumed that they solved the equations [c dimgray]ax[/c]-[c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=[c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] corresponding to ii. 5 and the equations [c dimgray]ax[/c]+[c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]=[c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray]2[/c] and [c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]-[c dimgray]ax[/c]=[c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] corresponding to ii. 6.

	Because the circle cuts AB produced in two points there are two real solutions, and as the circle always cuts AB produced there is always a real solution. This bears out the algebraical proof that the equation

	This could have been solved theoretically by the above methods, and the solution was certainly not beyond the powers of Hippocrates. It seems more probable, however, from the wording of Eudemus’s account, that he used an approximate mechanical solution for his purpose. This same construction can be used to give a geometrical solution of the equation [c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]-[c dimgray]ax[/c]=[c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c].
	In the figure it has only to be supposed that AB=[c dimgray]a[/c] and AΔ (instead of BΔ=[c dimgray]x[/c]. Then the theorem tells us that [c dimgray]x[/c]([c dimgray]x[/c]– [c dimgray]a[/c])=the gnomon=[c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c].

	[m1]\ [/m]
	For, since the straight line AΓ has been bisected at E, and ZA is added to it, therefore the rectangle contained by ΓΖ, ZA together with the square on AE is equal to the square on EZ \[ii. 6\]. But EZ is equal to EB; therefore the rectangle contained by ΓZ, ZA together with the square on AE is equal to the square on EB. But the squares on BA, AE are equal to the square on EB, for the angle at A is right \[i. 47\]; therefore the rectangle contained by ΓZ, ZA together with the square on AE is equal to the squares on BA, AE. Let the square on AE be taken away from each; therefore the rectangle contained by ΓZ, ZA which remains is equal to the square on AB. Now the rectangle ΓZ, ZA is ZK, for AZ is equal to ZH; and the square on AB is AΔ; therefore ZK is equal to AΔ. Let AK be taken away from each; therefore the remainder Zθ is equal to θΔ.

	or [c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] + [c dimgray]ax[/c] = [c dimgray]a[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]. by a method based on ii. 6. There is good reason to believe,
	as will be shown below, pp. 222–225, that the Pythagoreans
	knew how to construct a regular pentagon ABCDE, and it is
	probable that this theorem was used in the construction, as
	can be shown if CE is allowed to cut AD in F.
	For the Pythagoreans, knowing that the sum of the angles
	of any triangle is two right angles, would immediately have
	deduced that the sum of the internal angles of a regular
	pentagon is six right angles, and that each of the internal
	angles is therefore 6/5ths of a right angle. It easily follows
	that the angles CAD, ADC, DCA are respectively 2/5ths, 4/5ths
	and 4/5ths of a right angle, while the angles FCD, CDF, DFC
	are also respectively 2/5ths, 4/5ths and 4/5ths of a right angle.
	From this it follows that the triangles ACD, CDF are similar,
	while AF = FC = CD. In other words, the proposition gives a geometrical solution of the equation [c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]+[c dimgray]ax[/c]=[c dimgray]a[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	for it enables us to find AΘ or [c dimgray]x[/c].
	This equation is a particular case of the more general proposition [c dimgray]x[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]+[c dimgray]ax[/c]=[c dimgray]b[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	which, as was explained in the note on p. 197 n. [c dimgray]a[/c], can be solved The point F can therefore be found according to the method of ii. 6, and the pentagon constructed, starting from AD.

	at Γ, and let there be applied to the straight line AB the parallelogram AΔ deficient by the parallelogrammic figure ΔB described on the half of AB, that is, ΓB. I say that, of all the parallelograms applied to AB and deficient by figures similar and similarly situated to ΔB, AΔ is the greatest. For let there be applied to the straight line AB the parallelogram AZ deficient by the parallelogrammic figure ZB similar and similarly situated to ΔB. I say that AΔ is greater than AZ.

	For since the parallelogram ΔB is similar to the parallelogram ZB, they are about the same diameter. Let their diameter ΔB be drawn and let the figure be described.

	Then, since ΓZ is equal to ZE, and ZB is common, the whole Γθ is equal to the whole KE. But Γθ is equal to ΓΗ, since AΓ is equal to ΓB, And therefore HΓ is equal to EK. Let ΓZ be added to each. Then the whole AZ is equal to the gnomon ΛMN, so that the parallelogram ΔB, that is, AΔ, is greater than the parallelogram AZ.

Let KΛMN be constructed at once equal to the excess by which HB is greater than Γ and similar and similarly situated to Δ \[vi. 25\]. But Δ is similar to HB; therefore KM is also similar to HB \[vi. 21\]. Let ΚΛ correspond to HE, ΛM to HZ. Now, since HB is equal to Γ+KM, HB is therefore greater than KM. Therefore HE is greater than KΛ, and HZ than ΛM. Let HΞ be made equal to KΛ, and HO equal to ΛM, and let the parallelogram ΞHOΠ be completed. Therefore it is equal and similar to KM. Therefore HΠ is also similar to HB. Therefore HΠ is about the same diameter as HB \[vi. 26\]. Let HΠB be their diameter, and let the figure be described.

Therefore the whole of OB is equal to the whole of ΞB. But ΞB is equal to TE, since the side AE is also equal to the side EB \[i. 36\]. Therefore TE is also equal to OB. Let ΞΣ be added to both. Therefore the whole of ΤΣ is equal to the whole of the gnomon φΧΥ. But the gnomon φΧΥ was proved equal to Γ. Therefore TΣ is also equal to Γ.

	Let AB be bisected at E, and let there be described on EB the parallelogram BZ similar and similarly situated to Δ, and let Hθ be constructed at once equal to the sum of BZ, Γ and similar and similarly situated to Δ. Let Kθ correspond to ZΛ and KH to ZE. Now since Hθ is greater than ZB, Kθ is therefore greater than ZΛ, and KH than ZE. Let ZΛ, ZE be produced, and let ZΛM be equal to Kθ, and ZEN equal to KH, and let MN be completed; therefore MN is both equal to Hθ and similar. But Hθ is similar to EΛ; therefore MN is similar to EΛ \[vi. 21\]; and therefore EΛ is about the same diameter with MN \[vi. 26\]. Let their diameter ZΞ be drawn, and let the figure be described.

	Since Hθ is equal to EΛ+Γ, while Hθ is equal to MN, therefore MN is also equal to EΛ+Γ. Let EΛ be taken away from each; therefore the remainder, the gnomon ΨΧΦ, is equal to Γ.

The reason is that all numbers, of whatsoever kind, howsoever they be divided leave some least part which will not suffer further division; but all magnitudes are divisible [c dimgray]ad infinitum[/c] and do not leave some part which, being the least possible, will not admit of further division, but that remainder can be divided [c dimgray]ad infinitum[/c] so as to give an infinite number of parts, of which each can be divided [c dimgray]ad infinitum;[/c] and, in sum, magnitude partakes in division of the principle of the infinite, but in its entirety of the principle of the finite, while number in division partakes of the

There is always a real solution, and so no διορισμός is necessary as in the case of the preceding proposition. Heath ([c dimgray]The Thirteen Books of Euclid’s Elements[/c], vol. ii. pp. 266–267) again shows how the procedure is equivalent to the algebraic method of completing the square. Euclid’s solution corresponds to the root with the positive sign.

	Pythagoras, seeing that there are five solid figures, which are also called the mathematical figures, says that the earth arose from the cube, fire from the pyramid, air from the octahedron, water from the icosahedron, and the sphere of the universe from the dodecahedron.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]A regular solid is one having all its faces equal polygons
	and all its solid angles equal. The term is usually restricted
	to those regular solids in which the centre is singly enclosed.
	There are five, and only five, such figures—the pyramid,
	cube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron. They
	can all be inscribed in a sphere. Owing to the use made of
	them in Plato’s [c dimgray]Timaeus[/c] for the construction of the universe
	they were often called by the Greeks the [c dimgray]cosmic[/c] or [c dimgray]Platonic[/c]
	figures. As noted above (p. 148), Proclus attributes the
	construction of the cosmic figures to Pythagoras, but Suidas
	([c dimgray]infra[/c], p. 378) says Theaetetus was the first to write on them.
	The theoretical construction of the regular solids and the
	calculation of their sides in terms of the radius of the circumscribed
	sphere occupies Book xiii. of Euclid’s [c dimgray]Elements.[/c] It calls for mathematical knowledge which the Pythagoreans did not possess; but there is no reason why the Pythagoreans should not have constructed them practically in the manner of Plato by putting together triangles, squares or pentagons. The passages here given almost compel that conclusion.
	The subject is fully treated in [c dimgray]Die fünf Platonischen Körper[/c], by Eva Sachs ([c dimgray]Philologische Untersuchungen[/c], 21es Heft, 1917). Archimedes, according to Pappus, [c dimgray]Coll[/c]. v., ed. Hultsch 352-358, discovered thirteen semi-regular solids, whose faces are all regular polygons, but not all of the same kind.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]In place of ὁλκάς Wilamowitz suggests ὁλκός which is derived from ἕλκω and could be translated “envelope.” This fragment, it will be noted, does not identify the regular solids with the elements in the sphere, but it is consistent with that identification, for which the earliest definite evidence is Plato’s [c dimgray]Timaeus.[/c]
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Aëtius’s authority is probably Theophrastus.

	In the first place, then, it is clear to everyone, I think, that fire and earth and water and air are bodies. Now in every case the form of a body has depth. Further, it is absolutely necessary that depth should be bounded by a plane surface; and the rectilinear plane is composed of triangles. Now all triangles have their origin in two triangles, each having one right angle and the others acute; and one of these triangles has on each side half a right angle marked off by equal sides, while the other has the right angle divided into unequal parts by unequal sides.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] . . .
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Of the two triangles, the isosceles has one nature only, but the scalene has an infinite number; and of these infinite natures the fairest must be chosen, if we would make a suitable beginning. If, then, anyone can claim that he has a fairer one for the construction of these bodies, he is no foe but shall prevail as a friend; but we shall pass over all the rest and lay down as the fairest of the many triangles that from which the equilateral triangle arises as a third when two are conjoined. . . .[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In the next place we have to describe the form in which each kind has come into existence and from what numbers it is compounded. A beginning must be made with that kind which is primary and has the smallest components, and its element is the triangle whose hypotenuse is twice as long as the lesser side. When a pair of these triangles are joined diagonally and this is done three times, by drawing the hypotenuses

He finds a clue to the meaning in [c dimgray]Timaeus Locrus[/c] 98 e, where it is pointed out that of the five regular solids inscribable in the same sphere the dodecahedron has the maximum volume and “comes nearest” to the sphere.

	associated with Greeks and, among the Greeks, with one who was not at all the weakest, the sage Pythagoras, he had a residence built for himself, where he received and entertained the first of the citizens, teaching them that neither he nor his guests nor their descendants would ever die, but that they would come to a place where they would live forever and would possess all good things. But while he was doing this and saying what I have said, at the same time he had a subterranean dwelling built for himself. When the dwelling was finished, he vanished from the sight of the Thracians, and having descended into the subterranean dwelling he spent three years there. They missed him and mourned him, thinking that he had died. But in the fourth year he appeared to the Thracians, and thus what Salmoxis had said seemed credible to them. This is what they say he did. \[96\] As for me, I neither disbelieve the story about him and his subterranean dwelling, nor do I believe it very much, but I think that this Salmoxis lived many years earlier than Pythagoras.

	about this man, stated that the metempsychoses he experienced lasted 216 years. So it was after this number of years that Pythagoras came to be reborn and to live again—just like after the first cycle and return of the cube of six, generator of the soul, which is also recurrent by reason of its spherical character, as he also obtained a second life at other times for these reasons. This agrees with his having received the soul of Euphorbus at that time \[. . .\].

	Hermippus also says something else about Pythagoras: that after he arrived in Italy, he built a small subterranean dwelling and ordered his mother to note and write down on a tablet what happened and when, and then to send this down to him until he came back up. His mother did this. After some time Pythagoras came back up, withered and reduced to a skeleton. He went into the Assembly and said he was returning from Hades; and he read out to them what had happened. They were so moved by what he said that they wept, groaned, and were convinced that Pythagoras was someone divine, so that they even entrusted their wives to him so that they would learn some of his teachings; and these were also called the Pythagorean women.

	Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, who lived after these men \[i.e. Epimenides, Aristeas, Hermotimus, Abaris, and Pherecydes\], at first worked on the sciences and numbers, but later he did not refrain from the miracle-working of Pherecydes. For one day when a boat was sailing in at Metapontum bearing a cargo and the bystanders prayed that it arrive safely because of its cargo, he stood up and said, “Well, it will be revealed to you that what this ship is carrying is a dead body.” And another time, in Caulonia, as Aristotle says <he predicted the appearance of the white bear. The same Aristotle>, who has written many things about him, also says, “he killed, by biting it himself, the Tyrrhenian snake, whose bite is deadly.” And he predicted to the Pythagoreans that there would be a revolt. And that is why he left for Metapontum without letting anyone observe him. And while he was crossing the Cosas river together with other people he heard from it a great, superhuman voice: “Hail, Pythagoras!”; the people present were terrified. And once he appeared on the same day and at the same hour both in Croton and in Metapontum. And once when he was sitting in the theater he stood up, as

	The fact that it is not impious to kill and eat them \[scil. animals\] is proven by the fact that Pythagoras himself—while formerly they gave athletes milk to drink and cheese dipped in water to eat, and those who lived later rejected this diet and provided athletes with nutrition based on dry figs—was the first to reject the ancient \[scil. diet\] and to give meat to athletes, discovering a power that was much better for developing strength. And some people report that the Pythagoreans themselves laid hand upon living beings when they sacrificed to the gods.

First he found out how their relations were with their parents and their other relatives; then he observed them for inopportune fits of laughter and inappropriate silence and chattering, and \[scil. observed\] what their desires were, the friends they spent time with, their relation with these, how they mostly spent the day, and what caused them joy and grief. He also observed their appearance, their gait, the whole motion of their body, and, by examining them physiognomically using the traits of their nature, he made what was visible into signs for the invisible character in their soul.

	They say that when Pythagoras was asked to make a speech to children he composed discourses suitable for children, when it was to women, ones suitable for women, when it was to rulers, ones suitable for rulers, when it was to ephebes, ones suitable for ephebes. For it belongs to wisdom to discover the kind of wisdom appropriate for each person.

	The other Pythagoreans too used to say that not everything could be said to everyone, as Aristoxenus says in the tenth book of his [c dimgray]Rules of Education.[/c]

	T16 (18.2) Porphyry, [c dimgray]Life of Pythagoras[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	His mode of instruction was double. And among those who came to him, the ones were called ‘knowers’ ([c dimgray]mathêmatikoi[/c]), the others ‘listeners’ ([c dimgray]akousmatikoi[/c]). The ‘knowers’ were the ones who learned completely the scientific discourse that was superior and had been elaborated precisely, and the ‘listeners’ those who heard only the summary instructions of the writings without the more precise explanations.

	T17 (< 58C.4) Iamblichus, [c dimgray]Life of Pythagoras[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The philosophy of the ‘listeners’ ([c dimgray]akousmatikoi[/c]) consists in acousmatic statements \[cf. PYTH. c D15–D25\] that are not demonstrated and lack a justification, ones asserting that one must act in such and such a way; and in general they try to respect everything that that man said as though they were divine teachings, while they themselves claim that on their own they neither say nor should say anything, but they suppose that among themselves those men are best fitted for wisdom who possess the largest number of acousmatic statements.

	There were also two categories of those who practiced it \[i.e. the philosophy of Pythagoras\], the ‘listeners’ ([c dimgray]akousmatikoi[/c]) and the ‘knowers’ ([c dimgray]mathematikoi[/c]). Among these, the ‘knowers’ were recognized as Pythagoreans by the others, but they did not recognize the ‘listeners’ as being such, and they said that their doctrine was not that of Pythagoras, but that of Hippasus \[. . . cf.

	\[87\] But those among the Pythagoreans who practice the sciences agree that these \[i.e. the ‘listeners’\] are Pythagoreans, and they themselves say that they are even more so, and that what they say is true. They say that the reason for this difference is the following: \[88\] Pythagoras came from Ionia and Samos during the tyranny of Polycrates, while Italy was flourishing, and the most distinguished men in the cities became his comrades. But since it was difficult to conduct discussions in terms of sciences and demonstrations with the older men, for they had little time, being occupied as they were by political activities, he spoke with them in a plain manner, as he thought that they would still benefit if they knew what they had to do, even if they did

For the man who revealed that the figure with twenty angles (that is, the dodecahedron, one of the five figures called solid) could be inscribed within a sphere, died at sea for his sacrilege.

	\[i.e. the Pythagoreans\] and rebelled against them. Everyone agrees that the conspiracy took place while Pythagoras was absent, but they disagree about the details of his voyage at that time. Some say that Pythagoras had gone to Pherecydes of Syros, others to Metapontum. As for the causes of the conspiracy, there are a number of different reports. According to one of them, it was brought about by the men called Cylonians: Cylon, a man of Croton, one of the first citizens by birth, reputation, and wealth, but otherwise of a difficult character, violent, turbulent, and tyrannical, had conceived a great desire to participate in the Pythagorean way of life; he had come to see Pythagoras himself, who was already old, but he had been rejected for the reasons I have just mentioned. \[249\] When this happened, he and his friends began a violent war against Pythagoras and his companions, and the rivalry of Cylon and his allies was so fierce and absolute that it extended to the very last Pythagoreans. This is the reason why Pythagoras left for Metapontum, and he is said to have died there. But the so-called Cylonians continued to rebel against the Pythagoreans and to manifest a total hostility against them. But all the same, for a certain time the Pythagoreans’ virtue and valor and the will of the cities themselves had the upper hand, so that they wished to be governed by them. But in the end they went so far in their conspiracy against these men that they set on fire the

This happened for two reasons: the neglect on the part of the cities (for they paid no attention to a calamity of this kind and of such magnitude) and the annihilation of the most important leaders. Of the two survivors, both of them from Tarentum, Archippus returned to Tarentum, while Lysis, filled with hatred for this neglect, left for Greece and spent some time in Achaea in the Peloponnese and then moved to Thebes, where a certain enthusiasm for him had developed. Here Epaminondas became his student and called Lysis his father; and here he died. \[251\] The remaining Pythagoreans left Italy, except for Archytas[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] of Tarentum. They gathered at Rhegium and lived together there. As time passed and the political regimes became worse <. . .>. The most zealous ones were Phanton, Echecrates, Polymnastus, and Diocles, all from Phlius; Xenophilus of Chalcidia, among the Chalcidians from Thrace. They preserved the original mores and knowledge even though the school had come to an end, until they passed away nobly. This is what Aristoxenus reports.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]This catalog of male (218 names) and female (17 names) Pythagoreans, classified by city of origin (29), probably goes back to Aristoxenus of Tarentum. The Pythagorean identity of at least some of them is doubtful or is the result of invented filiations (this is the case of Parmenides, for example); inversely, we know of certain older Pythagoreans who are not included in the catalog (for example, Ameinias or Telauges, Pythagoras’ son and Empedocles’ alleged teacher). Many of these names are otherwise unknown. We have printed in boldface in the translation the names that appear elsewhere (in one way or another) in our edition and some that appear in Diels-Kranz’s but not in ours (cf. the General Introduction to Chapters 10–18).

	The Egyptians are the first to have said the following too: that a human’s soul is immortal, and when the body has been destroyed it enters each time into another living being that is being born; and after it has gone through all the animals, terrestrial, marine, and winged, it enters once again into a human body that is being born (it completes this cycle in three thousand years).

For when opinion and occasion are located for them in this region, and a little lower or higher injustice, judgment, or mixture, and they say as a proof for this that \[990a25\] each of these things is a number \[cf. PYTHS. ANON. D19\], and it happens that in this place there is already a multitude of constituted magnitudes because these affections follow each of the places: is this the same number, the one that is located in the heavens, of which we must understand that it is each of these things, or some other one besides this?

	In one regard the method of the Pythagoreans encounters fewer difficulties than the ones we spoke of earlier \[scil. the various theories about ideas and numbers of Platonic allegiance\], but in another it encounters others that are peculiar to it. For not to separate number removes many impossibilities; but that bodies be composed out of numbers, and that this number be the mathematical number—this is impossible. For it is not true to speak of indivisible magnitudes, and even if there were magnitudes of this sort, the units at least do not have magnitude; and how can a magnitude be constituted out of indivisibles? But certainly arithmetical number, at least, is constituted out of unities. But these people say that the things that are are number. At any rate they apply their theoretical conceptions to bodies as though they consisted of those numbers.

For it is not only strange that we do not hear anything—a fact for which they undertake to indicate the reason—but also, independently even of sensation, we do not suffer any effect. For excessive noises also tear apart the masses of inanimate bodies, like that of thunder, which splits apart stones and the hardest bodies. But given the size of the bodies that are moving and the fact that the sound that is transmitted is in proportion to the magnitude that is displaced, it follows of necessity that the magnitude \[scil. of the sound\] that arrives here must be many times superior and that the force of its intensity be overwhelming. But it is reasonable that we do not hear anything and that our bodies evidently do not suffer anything violent, given that no sound is produced.

	Such is the Pythagoreans’ theory with regard to numbers. And it is because of this \[scil. theory\], which was the principal \[scil. part of their philosophy\], that it came about that this philosophy became extinguished, first because of its enigmatic quality, and second because its writings were written in Doric (a dialect that is somewhat obscure), and, what is more, the doctrines that were investigated by it fell under suspicion of being spurious and misunderstood because of this, that it was not genuine Pythagoreans who divulged them. What is more, Plato and Aristotle, Speusippus and Aristoxenus and Xenocrates, as the Pythagoreans say, appropriated the fruitful parts with slight modifications, while they gathered together the superficial and

And from these there has come to be \[scil. the vault of\] the world, which is animated, intelligent, spherical, and surrounds the earth located in the middle, which is itself also spherical and inhabited all around. There are antipodes, and what is down for us is up for them.

If they are in equilibrium, this is the finest part of the year, of which the flowering, in the spring, is healthy while the declining, in the autumn, is unhealthy. So too, in the day, there is flowering, in the morning, and declining, in the evening; which is why this is also more unhealthy. The air around the earth is stagnant and unhealthy and everything that is in it is mortal; but the one that is higher is always in motion, pure, and healthy, and everything that is in it is immortal and for this reason divine.

	\[27\] The sun, the moon, and the other heavenly bodies are gods; for in them heat dominates, which is the cause of life; and the moon is illuminated by the sun. And there is a consanguinity between humans and gods, because humans have a share in heat: and that is why god exercises his providence for us. Fate is the cause of the administration both of the whole and of its parts. The ray of the sun penetrates through the cold and dense aether. And they call the air ‘cold aether,’ the sea and the moist ‘thick aether.’ This ray goes down into the depths and that is why it gives life to everything.

	\[28\] All those things are alive that have a share of heat; and that is why plants too are living beings. But not all things possess a soul. The soul is a piece detached from the aether, from both the warm aether and the cold one, and since it has a share in the cold aether the soul differs from life; and it is immortal, since what it has been detached from is immortal too. Animals are generated by one another from semen, and it is impossible for generation to come about from the earth. The semen is a drop of the brain which surrounds within itself a hot vapor; when it is conveyed to the womb it emits lymph, fluid, and blood that come from the brain; from these are formed flesh, muscles, bones, hair, and the whole body; and from the vapor, the soul and sensation.

	completed child is born in seven, nine, or most often ten \[scil. lunar\] months. It has within itself all the ratios suitable for life, and these form a series, maintaining it according to harmonic ratios, every feature being produced at the established moment. Sensation in general, and in particular vision, is a certain very hot vapor. And it is said that this is why one sees through air and through water. For heat is repelled far away from the cold, since if the vapor in the eyes were cold, it would differ (?) with regard to the air, which would be similar to it. But as it is, there are passages in which he calls the eyes ‘the gates of the sun.’ He teaches the same doctrine also about hearing and the other sensations.

	\[30\] The soul of the human being is divided into three parts: discrimination ([c dimgray]nous[/c]), intelligence ([c dimgray]phrenes[/c]), and the vital spirit ([c dimgray]thumos[/c]). Discrimination and the vital spirit are also found in the other animals, intelligence only in the human being. The principle of the soul extends from the heart to the brain. And the part of it that is located in the heart is the vital spirit; intelligence and discrimination are those located in the brain. Sensations are drops coming from these. The intelligent part is immortal, the others mortal. The soul is nourished by blood. The ‘reasons’ ([c dimgray]logoi[/c]) of the soul are winds. It is invisible, as are the ‘reasons,’ since the aether is invisible too.

	\[31\] What binds the soul are the veins, arteries, and tendons; but when it is strong and, having become independent, is at rest, it is its ‘reasons’ and activities that bind it. But when it is expelled onto the earth, it wanders in the air, similar to the body. Hermes is the administrator of the souls and that is why he is called ‘escorter,’ ‘guardian of the gates,’ and ‘subterranean’ ([c dimgray]khthonios[/c]), since it is he who sends the souls away from their bodies, both from the earth and out of the sea. The pure ones are led into the highest region, while the impure ones approach neither them nor each other, but are bound in unbreakable bonds by the Erinyes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	\[32\] All the air is filled with souls, and these are called demons ([c dimgray]daimones[/c]) and heroes. And it is by these that dreams and signs of sickness and health are sent to humans, and not only to humans, but also to sheep and other domestic animals. And it is to them that purifications, expiations, all forms of divination, incantations, and similar practices are directed. He says that the most important thing for human beings is the persuasion of the soul toward good or toward evil. Humans are happy when a good soul falls to their lot, but they can never be at rest nor master the same course (?).

Virtue is a harmony, as are health, all that is good, and god. And that is why the whole ([c dimgray]ta hola[/c]) is constituted in conformity with harmony. Friendship is an equality in conformity with harmony. We must think that the honors rendered to gods and to heroes are not identical: for the gods these are performed always, avoiding any blasphemous utterance, dressed in white and purified, but for the heroes it is only starting at midday. Purity is obtained by purifications, ablutions, lustrations, and by remaining uncontaminated by death, birth, and all pollution, and by abstaining from the meat and flesh of animals that have died, red mullets, gray mullets, eggs, oviparous animals, beans, and the other foods that are forbidden by those too who perform initiations in the temples \[. . .\].

	Given that the doctrine of Pythagoras was disseminated far and wide, it seems likely to me that it reached this city of ours; and this is not only probable as a conjecture, but it is also indicated by various traces. For who could suppose that—although what was called Magna Graecia flourished in Italy with such large and powerful cities and in these first the name of Pythagoras, and then that of the Pythagoreans, were held in such high regard—the ears of our people remained closed to their very learned voices? On the contrary, I think that it is because of their admiration for the Pythagoreans that posterity thought that King Numa too was a Pythagorean. For since they knew of Pythagoras’ doctrine and institutions and had heard from their ancestors of this king’s justice and wisdom, but were ignorant of the ages and dates because of their antiquity, they believed that that man, who was distinguished for his wisdom, had been a student of Pythagoras.

	to confess to you what love Pythagoras inspired in me. Sotion used to say why Pythagoras abstained from eating animals, and why Sextius did so later. The reason was different in each case, but in each case it was noble. \[18\] The latter believed that man had enough kinds of food without needing blood and that a habit of cruelty is produced whenever butchery is performed for the sake of pleasure. \[. . .\] \[19\] But Pythagoras stated that there is a consanguinity of all things with one another and an exchange of souls that transmigrate from one form into another. If you believe him, no soul perishes or even stops, except for a brief time, while it is being transferred into another body. We shall see after what periods of time and at what time it returns to man after it has wandered through many domiciles; but in the meantime, he made men afraid of crimes and parricide, given that they might encounter a parent’s soul without knowing it and commit violence against it with a knife or with their teeth, if there were any relative’s spirit lodging there \[cf. EMP. D29\].

	In the three treatises mentioned above, what is transmitted of Pythagoras in general is the following: he does not permit people to pray for themselves because they do not know what is beneficial; he calls drunkenness ‘damage,’ substituting the one word for the other, and he condemns all satiety, saying that no one should transgress proportion either in drink or in food. And with regard to sexual relations he says, “One must have sexual relations in the winter, not in the summer; in the fall and spring they are easier, but they are grievous in every season and not good for health.” \[. . .\] \[10\] And the life of man is divided as follows: “twenty years a child, twenty years an adolescent, twenty years a young man, twenty years an old man; and the ages of life have the following proportion with the seasons: child and spring, adolescent and summer, young man and autumn, old man and winter.”

	So it can no longer be doubted that it was by taking his starting point from Orpheus that Pythagoras composed his discourse about the gods, which for this reason he entitled ‘sacred’ \[. . .\], whether the treatise was really by that man, as most people say, or by Telauges \[. . .\]. For he says: “This <discourse> about the gods is by Pythagoras son of Mnemarchus, and I learned it when I was initiated in Leibethra in Thrace, with Aglaophamus performing the initiatory ritual, namely that Orpheus, son of Calliope, whom his mother had taught on Mount Pangaeus, said that the essence of number is the eternal and most providential principle of all the heavens, the earth, and the nature in between, and furthermore that it is the root of the permanency of divine things, gods, and demons.”

	anyone, with regard neither to themselves nor to one another, if number and its essence did not exist \[cf. PHILOL. D7\]. But as it is, by producing in the soul accord with perception, this \[scil. number\] makes all things knowable and adapted to each other according to the nature of the gnomon, composing and splitting the ratios of things, each separately, both those that are unlimited and those that limit \[cf. PHILOL. D2, D3\]. One can see the nature of number and its mighty power not only in the demonic realm and in that of the gods, but also in all human actions and discourses everywhere, in all the arts of craftsmanship and in music. The nature neither of number nor of harmony admits any deception, for it is not akin to them; but deception and envy belong to the nature of the unlimited, unknowing, and irrational, and deception does not fall in any way upon number. For deception is opposed and inimical to nature, while truth is akin and innate to the race of number. And the bodies in the sphere are five in number: the ones in the sphere are fire, water, earth, and air, and the vessel of the sphere is the fifth.”

	Philolaus: the world is indestructible. For he speaks as follows in his [c dimgray]On the Soul: [/c]“That is why, indestructible and inexhaustible, it persists for infinite eternity. For no other cause more powerful than this will be able to be found, neither within it nor outside it, that would be able to destroy it; but this world has existed since eternity and will persist for eternity, one and governed by the One that is akin, mightiest, and unsurpassed. But the world, which is one, continuous, traversed by the breath of nature, and eternally turned in a circle from the beginning, also possesses the principle of movement and change. And one part of it is unchanging while the other part changes; the unchanging part extends from the soul that envelops the universe down to the moon, the changing part from the moon down to the earth \[. . .\].”

And although she could have sold his discourses ([c dimgray]logoi[/c]) for a lot of money, she refused to do so, but thought that poverty and her father’s injunctions were more honorable than gold. And they say that when Damo was dying she sent the same letter to her daughter Bistala.

	Eudorus writes the following about them \[i.e. the Pythagoreans\]: “It should be said that according to the loftiest explanation the Pythagoreans say that the One is the principle of all things, but that according to the second explanation there are two principles of the production of things, the One and the nature that is opposed to it. All things, conceived by opposition, are arranged below: what is refined ([c dimgray]asteion[/c]) under the One, what is base under the nature that is opposed to it. That is why these are not absolutely principles for these people. For if the one is the principle of some things and the other the principle of others, then they are not common principles of all things, as the One is.” And he says again, “This is why they stated in a different way also that the One is the principle of all things, since both matter and all things come from it. And it is also the transcendent ([c dimgray]huperanô[/c]) god.” And then,

	explaining precisely \[. . .\]: “So I state that Pythagoras’ disciples admit that the One is the principle of all things, but that in a different way they introduce two highest elements. They call these two elements by many names: the first is called ordered, definite, known, male, odd, right, light; its contrary, disordered, indefinite, unknown, female, left, even, darkness, so that there is the One as first principle, and the One and the indefinite Dyad as elements, the One being in turn both principles. And it is clear that the One which is the principle of all things is different from the One which is opposed to the Dyad, which they also call ‘monad.’”

	As Moderatus too reports, it seems that the first among the Greeks to have had this conception about matter \[scil. that matter is distinguished from material realities by the absence of any measurable dimension\] were the Pythagoreans, and after them Plato. For he states, in conformity with the Pythagoreans, that the first One is above being and all existing substance ([c dimgray]ousia[/c]), he says that that the second One, which is what really exists ([c dimgray]to ontôs on[/c]) and is intelligible, is the Forms, that the third, which is what belongs to the soul ([c dimgray]to psukhikon[/c]), participates in the One and the Forms, and that the last nature deriving from this, which is that of the perceptibles, does not even participate

	Numenius, of the school of Pythagoras, refuting the Stoics’ doctrine on the principles by means of Pythagoras’ doctrine, with which he says Plato’s agrees, says that Pythagoras gave to god the name ‘monad’ and to matter that of ‘dyad’; which dyad he says is not at all generated inasmuch as it is indeterminate, but generated inasmuch as it is limited \[. . .\]. But some Pythagoreans, who did not understand correctly the meaning of this statement, thought that what was being said was that this indeterminate and unlimited dyad was also produced by the monad alone when the monad recedes from its nature and emigrates into the condition of the dyad—mistakenly, since \[. . .\] matter would come from god and the unlimited and indeterminate dyad from the monad.

	Those who have demonstrated the seriousness of their writings by the number of problems they discussed and who had their own personal theoretical conception are Plotinus and Amelius Gentilianus—the former, he \[i.e. Longinus\] thought, gave a clearer interpretation of the Pythagorean and Platonic principles than his predecessors had done (for what Numenius, Cronius, Moderatus, and Thrasyllus say is in precision very far from Plotinus’ writings on the same subjects) \[. . .\].

	And the Pythagoreans teach in a variety of ways that in truth these are the principles of all things \[scil. a version of the theory of principles analogous to the one reported by Eudorus, R67\]. For among the things that exist, some are conceived in function of their differences, others by way of contrariety, others relatively to something. In function of their difference are \[scil. conceived\] those that exist by themselves and possess a characteristic that is their own \[. . .\].

	But some people say that the body comes from a single point. For the flux of this point generates the line; the flux of the line produces a surface; and the displacement of this latter in depth generates the three-dimensional body. But this position of these Pythagoreans differs from that of the earlier ones. For they \[i.e. the earlier ones\] produced the numbers starting from two principles, the monad and the indefinite dyad, then, starting from the numbers, the points, lines, and the plane and solid figures. But the others construct all things starting from a single point \[. . .\].

	For his part, taking a different starting point \[scil. than did the representatives of the Ionian line of descent; cf. DOX. T20\], Pythagoras of Samos, son of Mnesarchus, the first to have called philosophy by this name, \[scil. stated that\] what are principles are the numbers and the proportions that exist among them, which he also calls ‘harmonies,’ while what is composed out of both of these are the elements, called ‘geometrical’; again, that the monad and the indefinite dyad are among the principles. Of these principles, according to him, the one tends toward the efficient and formal cause, which is intellect, god, the other toward the passive and material cause, which is the perceptible world. The nature of number is the decad. For all Greeks,

	all barbarians count up to 10 and when they have reached that they revert to the monad. And the power of 10 in turn, he says, resides in the 4 and in the tetrad. The reason for this is that if, reverting (?) from the monad, one constitutes the numbers by addition, one will complete the number 10 by proceeding up to 4. But if one goes beyond the \[scil. number\] of the tetrad, one will also fall beyond 10. For example, if one posits 1 and adds 2 and 3 and 4 to these, then one will complete the number 10. So that the number is in 10 by the monad \[i.e. the unit\], but in 4 by its power. And that is why the Pythagoreans proclaimed, thinking that the tetraktys is the greatest oath,

	No, by the man who bequeathed to our soul the tetraktys,
	The source that holds the roots of ever-flowing nature. \[cf. PYTHS. ANON. D16\]
	And our soul, he says, is composed out of the tetrad. For it is from intellect, knowledge, opinion, perception, that every art and every science comes and that we ourselves are rational. Therefore the intellect is the monad; for the intellect knows in accordance with the monad; for example, there are many men: but individually they can not be perceived nor grasped and they are unlimited, but we think this very thing, a single man alone, to whom no one else is found to be similar \[. . .\].
