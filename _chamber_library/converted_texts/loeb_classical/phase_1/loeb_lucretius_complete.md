	[b]Book 1[/b]
	Mother of Aeneas and his race, darling of men and
	gods, nurturing Venus,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] who beneath the smooth-moving heavenly signs fill with yourself the sea fullladen with ships, the earth that bears the crops, since through you every kind of living thing is conceived and rising up looks on the light of the sun: from you, O goddess, from you the winds flee away, the clouds of heaven from you and your coming; for you the wonder-working earth puts forth sweet flowers, for you the wide stretches of ocean laugh, and heaven grown peaceful glows with outpoured light. For as soon as the vernal face of day is made manifest, and the breeze of the teeming west wind blows fresh and free, first the fowls of the air proclaim you, divine one, and your advent, pierced to the heart by your might. Next wild creatures and farm animals dance over the rich pastures and swim across rapid rivers: so greedily does each one follow you, held captive by your charm,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Venus in this invocation is a figure of extraordinary complexity: as well as being the goddess of traditional religion and mythology who was mother of Aeneas and the Roman people, who was loved by Mars, and who appears on the coins of the [c dimgray]gens Memmia,[/c] she is the Empedoclean principle of Love (as opposed to Mars = Strife), representing the creative forces in the world, and she is the personification of the Epicurean [c dimgray]summum bonum,[/c] pleasure ([c dimgray]voluptas[/c]). Lucr. addresses her not only as the power of physical creation, but also as the giver of charm to his poetry (21–28). Spenser imitates 1–25 in [c dimgray]The Faerie Queene[/c] 4.10.44–47.

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]It has been suggested (D. E. W. Wormell in [c dimgray]G and R[/c] ser. 2, 7 \[1960\] 61) that Lucr. uses the archaic form [c dimgray]Mavors[/c] to emphasize the connexion between Mars and [c dimgray]mors.[/c]
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Lucr.’s description, which may owe something to a painting or sculpture, probably had some influence, through Politian, on Botticelli’s [c dimgray]Marte e Venere (cf.[/c] note on 5.740). Certainly Byron had it in mind in [c dimgray]Childe Harold[/c] 4.51.

However, strong arguments for the retention of the lines are summarized by Bailey 601–602, 1750. It is true that the passage comes in abruptly, and it may be assumed that Lucr. first wrote it in Book 2, and later inserted it here without adjusting it properly to its new context.

	Superstition,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] which displayed her head from the regions of heaven, lowering over mortals with horrible aspect, a man of Greece[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] was the first that dared to uplift mortal eyes against her, the first to make stand against her; for neither fables of the gods could quell him, nor thunderbolts, nor heaven with menacing roar, but all the more they goaded the eager courage of his soul, so that he should desire, first of all men, to shatter the confining bars of nature’s gates. Therefore the lively power of his
	mind prevailed, and forth he marched far beyond the flaming walls of the world,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] as he traversed the immeasurable universe in thought and imagination; whence victorious he returns bearing his prize, the knowledge what can come into being, what can not, in a word, how each thing has its powers limited and its deep-set boundary mark.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Therefore Superstition is now in her tum cast down and trampled underfoot, whilst we by the victory are exalted high as heaven.

That Lucr. regarded [c dimgray]religio[/c] as synonymous with [c dimgray]superstitio[/c] is implied by [c dimgray]super . . . instans[/c] in 65. The connexion of superstition with the celestial regions, stated in 64, is emphasized by the fact that the letters of [c dimgray]RELIGIONE[/c] are contained in [c dimgray]caELI REGIONibus[/c] (for further examples of this kind of play upon words in Lucr., see P.

For there is ignorance what is the nature of the soul, whether it be born or on the contrary find its way into men at birth, and whether it perish together with us when broken up by death, or whether it visit the gloom of Orcus and his vasty chasms, or by divine ordinance find its way into animals in our stead, as our own Ennius[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] sang, who first brought down from pleasant Helicon[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] a chaplet of evergreen leafage to win a glorious name through the nations of Italian men; although nevertheless he also sets forth in everlasting verses that there exist regions of Acheron,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] which neither our spirits nor our bodies endure to reach, but certain similitudes of them pallid in wondrous wise; whence he avers that the likeness of ever deathless Homer issued forth, and began to shed salt tears and to unfold the nature of things.

	the source from which each thing can be made and the manner in which everything is done without the working of gods.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]159[/c]For if things came out of nothing, all kinds of
	things could be produced from all things, nothing would want a seed.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Firstly, men could arise from the sea, from the earth scaly tribes, and birds could hatch from the sky; cattle and other farm animals and every kind of wild creature would fill desert and cultivated land alike, with no certainty as to birth.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Nor would trees be constant in bearing the same fruit, but they would interchange: all would be able to bear all. Seeing that there would be no bodies apt to generate each kind, how could there be a constant unchanging mother for things? But as it is, because every kind is produced from fixed seeds, the source of everything that is born and comes forth into the borders of light is that in which is the material of it and its first bodies; and therefore it is impossible that all things be born from all things, because in particular things resides a distinct power.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]174[/c]Besides, why do we see the rose put forth in
	spring, corn in the heat, grapes under persuasion of autumn, unless because each created thing discloses itself when at their own time the fixed seeds of things have streamed together, while the due seasons are present and the lively earth safely brings out things young and tender into the borders of light? But if they came from nothing, suddenly they would arise at uncertain intervals and at unsuitable times of the year; naturally, for there would be no first-beginnings to be restrained from generative union by the unfavourable season.

	growth of things, for seeds to collect, if they could
	grow from nothing; for youths would be made on a sudden from small infants, and trees would leap forth suddenly arising out of the earth. But manifestly none of these things takes place, since all things grow little by little, as is proper, from a fixed seed, and in growing[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] preserve their kind; so that you may infer that every kind grows and is nourished from its own proper material.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]192[/c]Add to this that without fixed seasons of rain
	in the year the earth cannot put forth her cheering fruits, nor furthermore can living things kept apart from food beget their kind and preserve life; so that you may more readily believe many bodies to be common to many things, as we see letters to be common to words, than that anything can exist without first-beginnings.

	[c dimgray]199[/c]Again, why could not nature produce men so
	large that they could wade through the deep sea as a ford and tear asunder great mountains with their hands and outlive many generations of life, if it is not because a fixed material is assigned for making things, from which what can arise is fixed? Therefore we must confess that nothing can come from nothing, since all things must have seed, from which each being created may be brought forth into the soft breezes of air.

	[c dimgray]208[/c]Lastly, since we see that cultivated land is

	there were none such, you would see all things without labour of ours, of their own will, grow much better.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]215[/c]Add to this that nature resolves everything
	again into its elements, and does not reduce things to nothing.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For if anything were perishable in all its parts, each thing would then perish in a moment snatched away from our sight. For there would be no need of any force, to cause disruption of its parts and dissolve their connexions. But as it is, because the seed of all things is everlasting, nature allows no destruction of anything to be seen, until a force has met it, sufficient to shatter it with a blow, or to penetrate within through the void places and break it up.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]225[/c]Besides, if time consuming all the material
	utterly destroys whatever by lapse of years it removes, whence does Venus restore living creatures to the light of life each after its kind, or, when they are restored, whence does the wonder-working earth nourish them and make them grow, providing food for each after its kind? Whence is the sea supplied by the springs within it, and by the rivers without, flowing from afar? Whence does the ether nourish the stars? For all things that are of perishable body must have been consumed by infinite time and ages past. But if through that space of time past there have been bodies from which this sum of things subsists being made again, imperishable indeed must their nature be; therefore things cannot severally return to nothing.

But as it is, since the bonds which combine the elements are different, and their matter is everlasting, things abide with body intact until a force meet them that is found vigorous enough to affect the texture of each.

	upon the ocean and overwhelms huge ships and scatters the clouds, and at times sweeping over the plains with rapid hurricane strews them with great trees and flogs the topmost mountains with tree-crashing blasts: so furious and fierce its howling, so savage and threatening the wind’s roar. Therefore undoubtedly there are unseen bodies of wind that sweep the sea, that sweep the earth, sweep the clouds of the sky also, beating them suddenly and catching them up in a hurricane; and they flow and deal devastation in the same way as water,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] which, soft as it is, suddenly rolls in overwelling stream when a great deluge of water from the high mountains swells the flood with torrents of rain, dashing together wreckage of forests and whole trees, nor can strong bridges withstand the sudden force of the coming water, with so mighty a force does the river, boiling with rain-torrents, rush against the piers; it works devastation with loud uproar and rolls huge rocks under its waves, and sweeps away whatever stands in its path. Thus therefore the blasts of the wind also must be borne along, which, like a strong river, when they have borne down in any direction, thrust all before them and sweep all away with frequent

The foot of St. Peter’s statue in St. Peter’s, Rome, is a familiar modern parallel.

	little adds to things, compelling them to grow in due measure, no keenness of sight, however strained, can perceive; nor further when things grow old by age and wasting, nor when rocks hanging over the sea are eaten away by the gnawing salt, could you discern what they lose upon each occasion.

	[c dimgray]329[/c]Yet everything is not held close and packed
	everywhere in one solid mass, for there is void in things: which knowledge will be useful to you in many matters, and will not allow you to wander in doubt and always to be at a loss as regards the universe and to distrust my words.

	were none, things could not in any way move; for that which is the province of body, to prevent[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and to obstruct, would at all times be present to all things; therefore nothing would be able to move forward, since nothing could begin to give place. But as it is, we discern before our eyes, throughout seas and lands and the heights of heaven, many things moving in many ways and various manners, which, if there were no void, would not so much lack altogether their restless motion, as never would have been in any way produced at all, since matter would have been everywhere quiescent packed in one solid mass.

	[c dimgray]346[/c]Besides, however solid things may be thought
	to be, here is proof that you may discern them to be of less than solid consistency. In rocks and caves the liquid moisture of waters oozes through, and the whole place weeps with plenteous drops. Food is dispersed through all the body in living creatures. Trees grow and at their time put forth their fruits, because their food is distributed all over them[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] from the lowest roots through trunks and through branches. Sounds pass through walls and fly through closed houses, stiffening cold permeates to the bones. But, if there were no void there which bodies might pass through in each case, you could not see this happen in any way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]358[/c]Lastly, why do we see some things surpass
	others in weight when they are no larger? For if there is as much body in a ball of wool as in lead, it is fitting that they should both weigh the same, since it is the property of body to depress everything downwards, but contrariwise the nature of void remains without weight. Therefore that which is equally great and is seen to be lighter without doubt shows itself to have more void; but contrariwise the heavier makes clear that it has more body in it, and much less of void. There is therefore without doubt, intermingled with things, that which we seek with keen-scented reasoning, that which we call void.

	from the truth. They say[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] that water yields to the
	pressure of scaly creatures and opens liquid ways, because fish leave room behind them for the yielding waves to run together; that so other things also are able to move in and out and to change place, although all is full. You must know that this has been accepted on reasons wholly false. For whither, I ask, will the scaly fish be able to move forward, unless the water shall give place? Into what place, again, will the water be able to move back, when the fish will be unable to go? Either then all bodies must be deprived of movement, or we must say that void is intermingled in things, as a result of which each thing may begin to move.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]384[/c]Lastly, if two bodies set in motion leap far apart
	after contact, of course it is necessary that air take possession of all the void which is made between the bodies. Further, however swiftly this air may run together with currents hurrying all around, yet the space will not be able to be filled all at one time; for the air must occupy each point of space in succession before the whole is occupied. But if by
	chance anyone thinks that this happens at the moment when the bodies have leapt asunder because the air becomes compressed, he goes astray; for in that case a void is made which was not there before, and a void also is filled which was there before; nor can air be compressed in such a way, nor, granting that it could, could it, I think, without void withdraw into itself and condense its parts together.

	bodies are and through which they move this way and that. For sensation common to men declares that body has its separate existence[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; and unless our belief in sensation is first firmly established, there will be no principle of appeal in hidden matters, according to which we may establish anything by the reason.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Then further, if there were no place and space which we call void, bodies could not be situated anywhere nor could they move anywhere at all in different directions, as I have already shown you above a little while ago.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]430[/c]Besides, there is nothing which you can call
	wholly distinct from body and separate from void, to be discovered as a kind of third nature.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] For whatever is to be, that must be something in itself; and if it shall be sensible to touch however light and small, it will increase the quantity of body by some increment either great or small if you will, provided it do exist, and will go to make up the sum. But if it shall be intangible, being unable to forbid anything to pass through it in motion at any point, undoubtedly this will be that which we call empty void. Besides, whatever shall exist of itself will either act upon something, or will necessarily be
	passive itself while other things act upon it, or it will be possible that things be and be done in it. But nothing can act or be acted upon without body, nothing can afford space but the void and the empty.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]

	Therefore besides void and bodies no third nature can be left self-existing in the sum of things—neither one that can ever at any time come within our senses, nor one that any man can grasp by the reasoning of the mind.

	[c dimgray]449[/c]For whatsoever things have a name, either you
	will find to be properties of these two or you will see them to be accidents of the same.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] A property is that which without destructive dissolution can never be separated and disjoined,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] as weight is to stone, heat to fire, liquidity to water, touch to all bodies, intangibility to void. Slavery, on the other hand, poverty and riches, freedom, war, concord, all else which may come and go while the nature of things remains intact, these, as is right, we are accustomed to call accidents. Time also exists not of itself,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] but
	from things themselves is derived the sense of what has been done in the past, then what thing is present with us, further what is to follow after. Nor may we admit that anyone has a sense of time by itself separated from the movement of things and their quiet calm.

	[c dimgray]464[/c]Moreover, when they say that the rape of
	Tyndareus’ daughter[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and the conquest by war of the Trojan tribes [c dimgray]are[/c] facts,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] we must see to it that they do not compel us to admit that these things [c dimgray]are[/c] of themselves, on the ground that those generations of men, of whom these were accidents, the irrevocable ages past have already carried away; for whatever has been done may be called an accident

	of bronze[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] is overcome by fire and liquefies; warmth oozes through silver and so does penetrating cold, seeing that we have felt both, as we duly grasp the goblet, when dewy[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] water is poured in from above. So true is it that there seems to be nothing solid in the world. But because nevertheless true reason and the nature of things compels, be with me, until in a few verses I make it clear that there are such things as consist of body solid and everlasting, which we teach to be seeds of things and their first-beginnings, out of which now all the sum of things has been built up.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]503[/c]First, since there has been found to exist a
	twofold and widely dissimilar nature of two things—of body, that is, and space in which all things are done—it is necessary that each exist by itself and for itself unmixed. For wherever is empty space, which we call void, there no body is; further, where body maintains itself, there by no means exists empty space. The first bodies therefore are solid and without void.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]511[/c]Besides, since there is void in created things,. atoms);
	there must be solid matter round about it, nor can anything by true reasoning be proved to conceal void in its body and to hold it within, unless you grant that which holds to be solid. Further, that can be nothing but a union of matter, which can hold the emptiness of things within it. Matter therefore, which consists of solid body, may be everlasting, though all else[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] be dissolved.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]For the possibility that this striking metaphor was inspired or influenced by Empedocles, see J. Longrigg, [c dimgray]CR[/c] N.S. 20 (1970) 8–9. The metaphor, though bold, is extremely apt, because bronze, like ice, is solidified, smooth, shiny, cold [c dimgray](cf.[/c] Homer, [c dimgray]II.[/c] 5.75, ψυχpὸν ... χaλκόν, quoted by Wakefield), and melts [c dimgray](cf. liquescit).[/c]

	[c dimgray]520[/c]Then further, if there were nothing void and
	empty, the universe would be solid; unless on the other hand there were definite bodies to fill up the places they held, then the existing universe would be vacant and empty space. Therefore without doubt body is marked off from void alternately, since the universe is not completely full nor yet empty. There are therefore definite bodies to mark off empty space from full. These can neither be dissolved by blows when struck from without, nor again be pierced inwardly and decomposed, nor can they be assailed and shaken in any other way, as I have shown you above a little while ago.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For it is seen that without void nothing can be crushed, or broken, or split in two by cutting, nothing can admit liquid or again percolating cold or penetrating fire, by which all things are destroyed. And the more each thing holds void within it, so much the more thoroughly it is shaken when these things attack it. Therefore, if the first bodies are solid and without void, as I have taught, these must be everlasting.

	[c dimgray]551[/c]Moreover, if nature had provided no limit to
	the breaking-up of things, by this time the bodies of matter would have been so reduced by the breakings of ages past, that from them nothing could within any fixed time be conceived and attain the full maturity of its life. For we see that anything can more quickly be dissolved than it can be remade again; therefore what all the long ages of infinite time past, disturbing and dissolving, had broken up before now, could never be made new in the time remaining. But as it is, in fact there remains appointed a fixed limit for the breaking, since we see each thing being remade, and at the same time definite periods fixed for things after their kind, in which they may attain the flower of life.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]565[/c]Add, moreover, that while the elements of

But contrariwise, if the first-beginnings of things were soft, no explanation will be possible to say out of what hard flints and iron could be produced; for all nature will utterly lack a foundation to begin upon. Therefore they are mighty by their solid singleness, and, by a denser combination of these, all things can be more closely packed and show hard strength.

	has never existed apart by itself nor will ever have force to do so, since it is essentially a part of something else, a first part with unity of its own, and then other and other like parts, each in its own place, in close formation fill up the nature of the atom; and since these cannot exist separately, they must necessarily so adhere to the whole that they cannot by any means be torn away.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] The first-beginnings, therefore, are of solid singleness, made of these smallest parts closely packed and cohering together, not compounded by the gathering of these parts, but strong rather by their eternal singleness, and from these nature allows nothing to be torn away or diminished any longer, but keeps them as seeds for things.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]615[/c]Besides, unless there is to be a smallest something,
	each littlest[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] body will consist of infinite parts, since of course a half of the half of anything will always have a half of its own, and there will be no limit to the division. Then what difference will there be between the sum of things and the least of things? There will be no difference; for although the whole sum of things be absolutely infinite, yet the bodies which are littlest will equally consist of infinite parts.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] But since true reasoning protests against this, and denies that the mind can believe it, you must yield and confess that there are things which no longer consist of any parts and are of the smallest possible

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]For the subtle and difficult doctrine of minimal parts [c dimgray](minimae partes, minima = ἐλάχιστα), cf.[/c] Epicurus, [c dimgray]Ep. ad Hdt.[/c] 56–59. Epicurus could not accept that matter is infinitely divisible and so postulated the existence of minute, physically indivisible particles, [c dimgray]i.e.[/c] atoms, but at the same time believed that each atom, since it has magnitude, must also have parts which, though they are physically inseparable from the atom, can be distinguished in thought. Lucr.  returns to the doctrine in 2.478–499 in connexion with atomic shapes.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c][c dimgray]parvissima[/c] is used here to avoid confusion with [c dimgray]minimum.[/c]
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The fallacious assumption that all infinities are equal is refuted by Newton in a passage quoted by Munro. Lucr.’s argument is probably aimed chiefly at Anaxagoras, perhaps also at the Stoics.

	[c dimgray]635[/c]Therefore[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] those who have thought that fire is
	the original substance of things, and that the whole sum consists of fire alone, are seen to have fallen far away from true reasoning. Of these Heraclitus[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] opens the fray as first champion, one illustrious for his dark speech rather amongst the frivolous part of the Greeks than amongst the serious who seek the truth.

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c][c dimgray]Quapropter[/c] refers back to [c dimgray]propterea quia[/c] in 631, as shown by Furley (see last note) 40. Heraclitus’ fire [c dimgray](cf.[/c] 645–646), like the minimal parts, would lack the variety which generative matter must have.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Refutations of rival physicists were traditional in the Epicurean school: [c dimgray]cf.[/c] Diogenes of Oenoanda fr. 6 Smith. Diogenes, like Lucr., begins with Heraclitus of Ephesus (c. 540-c. 480 b.c.), who taught that everything is in constant flux, that balance in the world is maintained by a continual struggle of opposites, and that fire, which exemplifies these fundamental doctrines, is the controlling element in the world. It is usually thought that Lucr.’s harsh attack on H. is aimed also at the Stoics, whom he influenced. This view has been challenged by D. J. Furley in [c dimgray]BICS[/c] 13 (1966) 15–16, but, though it would be a mistake to suppose that the Stoics are Lucr.’s main target, it is most improbable that he did not have them in mind at all.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]Lucr.’s mockery of Heraclitus’ famous oracular and paradoxical pronouncements reaches its climax with the outrageous metaphor in 644 (literally “dyed with an attractive sound”)—a clear parody of H.’s style. Moreover, [c dimgray]init .[/c]. . [c dimgray]dux proelia[/c] (638) ironically hints at H.’s contention that “strife is right” and “war is the father of all and king of all.” In 641 [c dimgray]stolidi[/c] may be intended to suggest [c dimgray]Stoici.[/c]

	[c dimgray]645[/c]For I want to know why things could be so
	various, if they are made of fire pure and simple; for it would be of no use that hot fire should become denser or rarefied, if the particles of fire still had the same nature as the whole fire has also; for the heat would be more intense with the particles compressed, but more faint if they were thrust apart and scattered apart: there is nothing else but this that you can suppose to be possible in such conditions, much less could there be all this variety of things produced from density or rarity of fire.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]655[/c]There is this also: if they should grant that
	void be mixed within things, fire will then be able to grow dense and be left rare; but because they see many things that fight against them, and they shrink from leaving pure void in things, while they fear the steep they lose the true path; nor again do they perceive that, if void be taken from things, all are condensed together and all become one mass, unable to emit anything briskly from itself, as burning fire throws off light and heat, so that you may see that it does not consist of closely crowded parts.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]665[/c]But if by chance they believe that there is any
	other way[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] by which fires can in their union be quenched and change their substance, assuredly if they shall not in any way spare so to do, then manifestly all heat will perish utterly into nothing, and from nothing will be fashioned all that is made[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; for whatever by being changed passes outside its own boundaries, at once this is the death of that which

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Any other than closer or looser union.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]If fire can somehow form such a union that it loses the quality of fire, then, if the process is continued, you get an end of heat or fire entirely, and so come to the conclusion that “everything can come from nothing”; for by changing fire into something that is not fire you have “killed” fire.

	and sound in those fires of theirs,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] or you will find that all things return utterly into nothing, and that from nothing the supply of things is born again and lives. Now therefore, since there are certain most definite bodies which preserve their nature always the same, by the going and coming of which and their changed order things change their nature and bodies transform themselves, we may be sure that these elements of things are not made of fire. For it will be of no use that some should separate and depart, and others be added, and some change place, if nevertheless all retained the nature of fire; for whatever they should make would be altogether fire. But, as I think, the truth is this: there are certain bodies which by their concurrences, motions, order, positions, shapes, produce fire, and which, when their order is changed, change the nature of the thing, and are not like fire, nor like any other thing that can emit particles to the senses and by impact touch our sense of touch.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]690[/c]Further, to say that all things are fire, and that
	there exists no true thing in the number of things except fire, as this same man does, appears to be raving madness. For on the basis of the senses he himself fights against the senses, and shakes the credit of that upon which all belief depends, by which this very fire as he names it is known to himself; for he believes that the senses can truly perceive fire, but not the other things which are no less clear: which seems to me to be at once folly and raving. For to what shall we appeal? What can we find more certain than the senses themselves, to mark for us truth and falsehood?[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]701[/c]Besides, why should one take away everything
	and choose to leave only the nature of fire, rather than deny that fire exists and still allow that something else exists? It seems equal madness to assert either.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]705[/c]Therefore those who have thought that fire is
	the material of things and that the universe can consist of fire, and those who have laid down that air[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] is the prime element for producing things, or whoever have thought that water[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] moulds things by itself, or that earth[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] produces all things and changes itself into the natures of all things, are seen to have gone far astray from the truth. Add, moreover,
	those who take the first-beginnings of things in couples, joining air to fire[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and earth to water,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and those who think that all can grow forth out of four
	things,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] from fire, earth, air, and water. Foremost among whom is Empedocles of Acragas[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c]: who was
	born within the triangular coasts of that island, around which the Ionian deep, flowing with its vast windings, sprinkles the salt brine from its green waves, and the swift-moving sea in its narrow strait divides with its waves the shores of the Aeolian[c dimgray][sup]h[/sup][/c] land

	[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c]Empedocles (c. 493-c. 433 b.c.) of Acragas (Agrigentum) in Sicily was not only an influential philosopher, scientist, and physician, but also a hexameter poet of distinction—hence Lucr.’s great admiration for him. In his Περὶ Φύσεως, of which about 350 lines are extant, he explained the universe as a spherical plenum ([c dimgray]cf.[/c] 742–745) containing four elements (fire, air, water, earth) which unite and separate under the influence of Love and Strife. A second poem, entitled κaθaμoί (“Purifications”), of which about 100 lines survive, was strongly influenced by Orphic and Pythagorean beliefs, and shows that E. was a remarkable mixture of rationalist and mystic. In 731–733 Lucr. perhaps has in mind E.’s claim to be a god (fr. 112).
	[c dimgray][sup]h[/sup][/c]If the text printed is correct (see critical note), the reference is to that part of southern Italy closest to Sicily. Although that region is not elsewhere called Aeolia, it is close to the Aeolian islands, and there was a legend that Rhegium had been founded by Aeolus’ son, Iocastus.

	limit at all to the cutting-up of bodies or fixed pause to their breaking, and deny that there exists in things any least part at all, although we see that in each thing there exists that extremest point which according to our senses is seen to be least, so that you may deduce from this that in those things which you cannot perceive a least exists which they have as their extreme.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Moreover, since they make the
	first-beginnings of things to be soft, things which we see to be generated and to be wholly of perishable body, the sum of things must by this time return to nothing, and the store of things be reborn from nothing to grow vigorous; and how far both these views are from the truth you will know already.

	by chance you think fire and the substance of earth and airy wind and liquid water so come together as to change nothing of their nature in the union, you

Why not rather assume some bodies endowed with such a nature that, if they happen to have produced fire, the same, when a few have been taken away and a few added, and their arrangement and motion have been altered, are able to make the winds of the air, and in this way all other things can interchange with others?

Moreover, all through these very lines of mine you see many elements common to many words, although you must confess that lines and words[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] differ one from another both in meaning and in the sound of their soundings. So much can elements do, when nothing is changed but order; but the elements that are the beginnings of things can bring with them more kinds of variety, from which all the various things can be produced.

	[c dimgray]830[/c]Now let us also examine the [c dimgray]homoeomeria[/c] of of Anaxagoras.
	Anaxagoras,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] as the Greeks call it, which cannot be named in our language because of the poverty of our mother speech,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] but yet it is easy to explain the thing itself in words.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]823–825=2.688–690. Comparison between the disposition of letters in words and the arrangement of atoms in compound bodies is made also in 196–197, 912–914, 2.1013–1018. Both the Latin [c dimgray]elementa[/c] and the Greek στοιχεῖα can mean both physical elements and the letters of the alphabet.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Anaxagoras ([c dimgray]c[/c]. 500-[c dimgray]c[/c]. 428 b.c.) of Clazomenae, near Smyrna, resided in Athens from [c dimgray]c.[/c] 456 until [c dimgray]c.[/c] 432 b.c., when he was prosecuted and banished for impiously maintaining that the sun is not a divinity, but a red-hot mass of stone larger than the Peloponnese. Like the atomists, whom he preceded and influenced, he supposed that matter exists in the form of an infinite number of separate particles; but his particles differed from atoms in that they were heterogeneous in substance; moreover, unlike the atomists, he believed in the infinite divisibility of matter and denied the existence of void. The term [c dimgray]homoeomeria,[/c] which means “similarity of parts,”was probably not used by A. himself (see G. S. Kirk, J. E. Raven and M. Schofield, [c dimgray]The Presocratic Philosophers,[/c] 2nd ed., 376–378, W. K. C. Guthrie, [c dimgray]A History of Greek Philosophy[/c] II 325–326).

	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]It is probable that all the examples in 835–841 are taken from Anaxagoras himself. See Munro, Ernout-Robin, Bailey.

	both solid food and liquid, is held to consist of things unlike itself, bones and sinews, pus and blood commingled. Besides, whatever bodies grow out of the earth, if they are in the earth, then the earth must consist of things unlike itself which arise out of the earth. Apply this reasoning to other cases, and you may use the very same words. If flame, if smoke and ashes, are hidden in wood, the wood must necessarily consist of things unlike itself, of unlike things, which arise out of the wood. Besides, whatever bodies the earth nourishes and increases \[must consist of things unlike themselves, which in their tum must contain things unlike themselves\].[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]875[/c]Here is left some slight opportunity for evasion,
	which Anaxagoras turns to advantage in supposing that all things are hidden immingled in all things, but that alone appears which preponderates in the mixture and is more to be seen and placed right in the front. But this is far removed from true reasoning. For then it were proper that corn also, when it is being ground by the crushing strength of the millstone,
	should show often a sign of blood or something of those substances which are nourished in our bodies; and when we rub with stone upon stone the blood should trickle. In the same way it were fitting that herbage also and water should often emit drops

The parallelism shows that Lucr. feels that his creative urge (to write poetry) is comparable to, though of course on a higher level than, the creative urge given to animals by Venus. In this connexion, it is relevant to recall that Venus is invoked in the first proem not only as the power of physical creation, but also (24–28) as the giver of grace to Lucr.’s verses.

	[c dimgray]958[/c]The universe then is not limited along any of
	its paths; for if so it ought to have an extremity. Again, clearly nothing can have an extremity unless there be something beyond to bound it, so that something can be seen, beyond which our sense can follow the object no further. Now since we must confess that there is nothing beyond the sum of things, it has no extremity, and therefore it is without end or limit.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Nor does it matter in which of its quarters you stand: so true is it that, whatever place anyone occupies, he leaves the whole equally infinite in every direction.

For you must confess and accept one of the two; but each of them shuts you off from all escape, and compels you to own that the universe stretches without end. For whether there is something to hinder and keep it from going whither it is sent and from fixing itself at its mark, or whether it passes out, that was no boundary whence it was sped.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] In this way I shall go after you, and wherever you place your extremest edge, I shall ask what at last happens to the lance.

	[c dimgray]984[/c]Besides, if all the space in the universe stood
	contained within fixed boundaries on all sides and all were limited, by this time the store of matter would by its solid weight have run together from all sides to the bottom, nor could anything be done under the canopy of heaven, nor would heaven exist at all or the sun’s light, because assuredly all matter would be lying in a heap from sinking down through infinite ages past. But as it is, sure enough no rest is given to the bodies of the first-beginnings, because there is no bottom whatsoever, for them to run together as it were into it and fix their abode there. Always the business of the universe is going on with incessant motion in every part, and the elements of matter are being supplied from beneath, rushing from infinite space.

	[c dimgray]998[/c]Lastly, one thing is seen before our eyes to be

	she compels body to be bounded by void and that again which is void to be bounded by body, so that by this alternation she renders the universe infinite, or else either one of these two, if the other did not bound it, would yet by itself spread abroad without limit. \[But if space were finite, it could not contain an infinite amount of matter; and if matter
	were finite\], neither sea nor land nor the gleaming regions of the sky nor the race of men nor the holy bodies of gods could stand fast for the fraction of an hour; for the store of matter, driven abroad from its union, would be rushing dissolved through the great void, or rather would never have been compacted to

	of their streams, and earth, cherished by the sun’s heat, renews its produce, and the generation of living things springs up and flourishes, and the gliding fires of heaven do live; which they would by no means do, unless a store of matter could arise up out of the infinite, from which they are accustomed to replace in season all that has been lost. For as the nature of animals, deprived of food, wastes away, losing its body, so all things must be dissolved away as soon as matter, turned somehow from its course, has ceased to be supplied. Nor can blows from without on all sides conserve the whole of every world which has been formed by the union of atoms. They can indeed batter it frequently, and delay one part until others shall come and the sum can be filled up; yet they[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] are compelled sometimes to rebound and thereby to give the first-beginnings of things ample time and space to escape, so that they can fly clear away from their combination. Therefore again and again I say, it is necessary that they should arise up in large numbers; indeed, in order that even the blows themselves be supplied, there is need of an infinite quantity of matter on all sides.

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]It has been generally assumed that the theory which Lucr. attacks is, as Lambinus thought, “Peripateticorum et veterum Academicorum et Stoicorum,” and that the Stoics are his main target. However, D. J. Furley, [c dimgray]BICS[/c] 13 (1966) 16–23, following E. Bignone, has argued that Lucr. does not have the Stoics in mind at all, but only the Peripatetics. Since Lucr.’s argument is no doubt derived from Epicurus, who probably [c dimgray]was[/c] arguing chiefly against Aristotle (so far as we know, Epicurus himself did not attack the Stoics), it is natural that it should be most applicable to the Peripatetic form of the theory, but it is hard to believe that Lucr., writing at a time when Stoicism was his school’s chief rival, did not aim it at the Stoics at all, even if it was not relevant to the Stoic view in every detail. Epicurean writers did not always present the views of their opponents fully and fairly.

	if you believe that anything can stand upon itself—
	and that the weights that are beneath the earth all press upwards and come to rest on the earth upside down, like the images which we now see reflected by water. And likewise they maintain that the animals there move about head downwards, and cannot fall back from the earth into the space of sky any more than our bodies of themselves can fly into the regions of the sky; that when they see the sun, we behold the stars of night, and they share the seasons of the heavens with us alternately, and pass nights which are equal to our days. But it is empty \[error that approves\][c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] these \[fallacies\] to the stupid, because they have embraced \[them with twisted reasoning\]. For there can be no middle, \[since the universe is\] infinite.
	Nor indeed, if middle there really were, could anything at all stand still there \[on that account rather\] than \[be driven\] far \[away\] for some different reason. For all place and space, which we call void, must yield a passage through middle or not-middle equally to weights, wherever their movements

Nor is there any place in which bodies, when they have come thither, can lose the force of weight and stand still in the void; nor again must that which is void ever give support for anything, but, as its nature craves, it must proceed to give place. Therefore, things cannot be held in combination together in any such way, overcome by a yearning for the middle.

	[c dimgray]1083[/c]Besides, inasmuch as they do not suppose all
	bodies to press towards the middle, but only those of earth and water—the liquid of the sea and great waters that descend from the mountains, and such things as are contained as it were in earthly frame—, but on the other hand explain that the thin breezes of air and hot fires are at the same time carried away from the middle; and that the whole firmament all about twinkles with constellations and the sun’s flame feeds through the blue sky, because all the heat fleeing from the middle gathers itself together there; and that the topmost branches of trees could not even produce leaves, if food were not \[distributed\] to each from the earth, gradually \[supplied by an internal fire, their reasoning is inconsistent.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]...

	Pleasant it is, when on the great sea the winds
	trouble the waters, to gaze from shore upon another’s great tribulation: not because any man’s troubles are a delectable joy, but because to perceive what ills you are free from yourself is pleasant. Pleasant is it also to behold great encounters of warfare arrayed over the plains, with no part of yours in the peril. But nothing is more delightful than to possess lofty sanctuaries serene, well fortified by the teachings of the wise, whence you may look down upon others and behold them all astray,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] wandering abroad and seeking the path of life:—the strife of wits, the fight for precedence, all labouring night and day with surpassing toil to mount upon the pinnacle of riches[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and to lay hold on power. O pitiable minds of men, O blind intelligences! In what gloom of life,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] in how great perils is passed all your poor span of time! not to see that all nature barks for is this, that pain be removed away out of the body, and that the mind, kept away from care and fear, enjoy a feeling of delight!

	[c dimgray]20[/c]Therefore we see that few things altogether
	are necessary for the bodily nature, only such in each case as take pain away,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and can also spread for our use many delights; nor does nature herself ever crave anything more pleasurable, if there be no golden images of youths about the house, upholding fiery torches in their right hands that light may be provided for nightly revellings,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] if the hall does not shine with silver and glitter with gold, if no crossbeams panelled and gilded echo the lyre, when all the same[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] stretched forth in groups upon the soft grass beside a rill of water under the branches of a tall tree men merrily refresh themselves at no great cost, especially when the weather smiles, and the season of the year besprinkles the green herbage with flowers.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] And no quicker do hot fevers fly away from your body, if you have pictured tapestry and blushing purple to toss upon, than if you must lie sick under the poor man’s blanket.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]According to Epicurus, pleasure is limited, and the limit of pleasure for the body is reached when the natural and necessary desires are satisfied and the pain caused by want is removed.

	[c dimgray]67[/c]For certainly matter is not one packed and coherent mass, since we see each thing decreasing, and we perceive all things as it were ebbing through length of time, and age withdrawing them from our
	eyes; although nevertheless the sum is seen to remain unimpaired for this reason, that whenever bodies pass away from a thing, they diminish that from which they pass and increase that to which they have come, they compel the first to fade and the second on the contrary to bloom, yet do not linger there. Thus the sum of things is ever being renewed, and mortal creatures live dependent one upon another. Some species increase, others diminish, and in a short space the generations of living creatures are changed and, like runners, pass on the torch of life.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]80[/c]If you think the first-beginnings of things can
	stand still, and by standing still can beget new motions amongst things, you are astray and wander far from true reasoning.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] For since the first-beginnings of things wander through the void, they must all be carried on either by their own weight or by a chance blow from another atom. For when in quick motion they have often met and collided, it follows that they leap apart suddenly in different directions; and no wonder, since they are perfectly hard in their solid weight and nothing obstructs them from behind.

	And to show you more clearly that all the bodies of matter are constantly being tossed about, remember that there is no bottom in the sum of things and the first bodies have nowhere to rest, since space is without end or limit, and I have shown at large and proved by irrefragable reasoning that it extends immeasurable from all sides in all directions.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Since this stands firm, beyond doubt no rest is granted to the first bodies throughout the profound void, but rather driven by incessant and varied motions, some after being pressed together then leap back with wide intervals, some again after the blow are tossed about within a narrow compass. And all those which being held in combination more closely condensed
	collide and leap back through tiny intervals, caught fast in the complexity of their own shapes, these constitute the strong roots of stone and the bulk of fierce iron and the others of their kind. Of the rest, which go on wandering through the great void, a very few leap far apart and pass far back with long intervals between: these supply thin air for us and the gleaming light of the sun. And many besides wander through the great void which have been rejected from combination with things, and have nowhere been able to obtain admittance and also harmonize their motions.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	sun’s rays are let in and pour their light through a
	dark room: you will see many minute particles mingling in many ways throughout the void[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in the light itself of the rays, and as it were in everlasting conflict struggling, fighting, battling in troops without any pause, driven about with frequent meetings and partings; so that you may conjecture from this what it is for the first-beginnings of things to be ever tossed about in the great void. So far as it goes, a small thing may give an analogy of great things, and show the tracks of knowledge.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]125[/c]Even more for another reason it is proper that you give attention to these bodies which are seen to be in turmoil within the sun’s rays, because such turmoil indicates that there are secret and unseen motions also hidden in matter. For there you will see how many things set in motion by unseen blows change their course and beaten back return back again, now this way, now that way, in all directions. You may be sure that all take their restlessness from
	the first-beginnings. For first the first-beginnings of derive°their things move of themselves; then the bodies that form a small combination[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and, as one may say, are atoms, nearest to the powers of the first-beginnings, are set moving, driven by the unseen blows of these, while they in their tum attack those that are a little larger. Thus the movement ascends from the first-beginnings and by successive degrees emerges upon our senses,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] so that those bodies also are moved which we are able to perceive in the sun’s light, yet it does not openly appear by what blows they are made to do so.

	[c dimgray]142[/c]Now Memmius, what swiftness is granted to the
	bodies of matter, you may understand from what follows in a few words. First, when the dawn diffuses new light over the earth, and the different birds flitting about through pathless woods through the soft air fill every part with their liquid notes, how suddenly at such time the sun arising is accustomed to envelop and flood the whole world with his light, we see to be plain and manifest to all. But that heat and that light serene which the sun sends, does not pass through empty void; therefore it is forced to go more slowly, while it beats its way so to speak through waves of air. Nor do the particles of heat move alone and singly, but linked together and massed together; therefore they are at the same time retarded by one another and obstructed from without, so that they are forced to
	go more slowly. But the first-beginnings, which are of solid singleness,
	when they pass through the empty void, are not delayed by anything from without, and being themselves units composed of their own parts,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] when they are carried each to that one point to which their first efforts tend, most certainly they must be of exceeding swiftness and must be carried far more quickly than the light of the sun, and traverse a space many times as wide in the same time that the sun’s lightnings take to pervade the heavens.

	[c dimgray]165[/c]... nor[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] to follow up the first-beginnings separately one by one, that they may see in what way everything is done.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Although each atom has a number of minimal parts, it is uncompounded, for the minimal parts are physically inseparable [c dimgray](cf.[/c] 1.599-634).

But when they imagine the gods to have arranged all for the sake of men, they are seen to have departed widely from true reasoning in every way. For although I might not know what first-beginnings of things are, this nevertheless I would make bold to maintain from the ways of heaven itself, and to demonstrate from many another source, that the nature of the universe has by no means been made for us through divine power: so great are the faults it

	timbers and beams, we must not think they do this of themselves, being shot up without a force. Even so when blood is let out from our body, out it spirts, leaping forth on high and sprinkling its red drops. Do you not see also with what force liquid water spits out timbers and beams? For the deeper we have thrust them and pushed them right down, pressing laboriously with full force and many together, the more eagerly does the water vomit them back and shoot them back up, so that they issue forth and leap out more than half their length. Yet we do not doubt, I think, that, as far as in them lies, these are all carried downwards through an empty void. In this way, therefore, flames also must be able to rise up, squeezed out upwards through the breezes of the air, although, as far as lies in them, their weights fight to draw them down; and do you not see how the nightly torches of the sky fly up aloft and draw their long trails of flame in whatever direction nature has given them a way? how stars and luminaries fall to the earth?

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]216[/c]One further point in this matter I desire you
	to understand: that while the first bodies are being carried downwards by their own weight in a straight line through the void, at times quite uncertain and uncertain places, they swerve a little from their course, just so much as you might call a change of motion.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] For if they were not apt to incline, all would fall downwards like raindrops through the profound void, no collision would take place and no blow would be caused amongst the first-beginnings: thus nature would never have produced anything.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]225[/c]But if by chance anyone believes it to be
	possible that heavier elements, being carried more quickly straight through the void, fall from above on the lighter, and so deal blows which can produce generative motions, he is astray and departs far from true reasoning. For whatever things fall through water and through fine air, these must speed their fall in accordance with their weights, because the body of water and the thin nature of air cannot delay each thing equally, but yield sooner overcome by the heavier; but contrariwise empty void cannot offer any support to anything anywhere or at any time, but it must give way continually, as its nature

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The theory of the swerve (πapέγκλισις [c dimgray]clinamen, declinatio, inclinatio)[/c] of atoms is not described by Epicurus in his extant writings, but is mentioned by Cicero, Philodemus, Plutarch, Diogenes of Oenoanda, and others. Lucr.’s account (216-293) is the fullest which we have. Epicurus, influenced above all by Aristotle, rejected the determinism of Democritus and believed in the freedom of the individual will, and the theory of the atomic swerve was designed to explain free will (see 251-293) as well as to account for collisions between atoms moving through the void.

	demands: therefore they must all be carried with equal speed, although not of equal weight, through the unresisting void. So the heavier bodies will never be able to fall from above on the lighter, nor deal blows of themselves so as to produce the various motions by which nature carries on her processes. Therefore again and again I say, the bodies must
	incline a little; and not more than the least possible, or we shall seem to assume oblique movements, and thus be refuted by the facts. For this we see to be manifest and plain, that weights, as far as in them lies, cannot travel obliquely, when they drop straight from above, as far as one can perceive; but who is there who can perceive that they never swerve ever
	so little from the straight undeviating course?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]251[/c]Again, if all motion is always one long chain,
	and new motion arises out of the old in order invariable, and if the first-beginnings do not make by swerving a beginning of motion such as to break the decrees of fate, that cause may not follow cause from infinity, whence comes this free will in living creatures all over the earth, whence I say is this will wrested from the fates by which we proceed whither pleasure leads each, swerving also our motions not at fixed times and fixed places, but just where our mind has taken us?[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For undoubtedly it is his own will

	open at a given moment, that nevertheless the eager force of the horses cannot burst forth so suddenly as the mind itself craves? For all the mass of matter must be stirred up together through the whole body, in order that thus stirred up together it may all with one combined effort follow the passion of the mind; thus you may see that the beginning of motion is made by the intelligence, and the action moves on first from the will of the mind, then to be passed onwards through the whole body and limbs.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]272[/c]Nor is this the same as when we move forwards
	impelled by a blow from the strength and mighty effort of another; for then it is clear that all the matter or the whole body moves and is hurried against our will, until the will has curbed[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] it back through the limbs. In this case do you see then that, although an external force propels many men and forces them often to move on against their will and to be hurried headlong, yet there is in our breast something strong enough to fight against it and to resist? by the arbitrament of which, also, the mass of matter is compelled at times to be turned throughout body and limbs, and, when thrust forward, is curbed back and settles back steadily.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]284[/c]Therefore you must admit that the same exists in the seeds also, that motions have some cause other than blows and weights, from which this power is born in us, since we see that nothing can be produced from nothing. For it is weight that prevents all things from being caused through blows by a sort of external force; but what keeps the mind itself

	[c dimgray]294[/c]Nor was the mass of matter ever more closely

	swimming tribes of scaly fish, fat cattle, and wild beasts, the different birds which throng the joyous regions of water around bank and spring and lake, and which crowd the pathless woods through and through as they flit about—of these go on to take any one in any kind, and you will find nevertheless that each differs from each in shape. Nor is there
	any other way by which the young could recognize the mother or the mother her young; and this we see they can do, and that they are known clearly to each other no less than men are. For often in front of the noble shrines of the gods a calf falls slain beside the incense-burning altars, breathing up a hot stream of blood from his breast; but the mother bereaved wanders through the green glens, and seeks on the ground the prints marked by the cloven hooves, as she surveys all the regions if she may espy somewhere her lost offspring, and coming to a stand fills the leafy woods with her moaning,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and often revisits the stall, pierced with yearning for her calf; nor can tender willow-growths, and herbage growing rich in the dew, and those rivers flowing level with their banks, give delight to her mind and rebuff her sudden care, nor can the sight of other calves in the happy pastures divert her mind and lighten her load of care: so persistently she seeks for something of her own that she knows well. Besides, tender kids with trembling voices know their horned mothers, and mischievous lambs the flocks

	tingle and force it to weep, or such as by their ugly aspect seem terrible and vile. For nothing whatsoever
	that soothes the senses is made without some smoothness in the first-beginnings; but contrariwise whatever is offensive and harsh has been found to be not without some roughness in its material. There are also in the series those first-beginnings which are rightly thought to be neither smooth nor altogether hooked with curved points, but rather to have small angles a little projecting, so that they can rather tickle our senses than hurt them; of which kind we have now tartar of wine and the flavour of elecampane. Again, here are hot fire and cold frost toothed in different fashion to prick our bodily senses, as the touch in either case proves to us. For touch, so help

Therefore novelty of shapes implies increase

All things might also change back for the worse, as we have said they might do for the better: for in the backwards way also one thing would be more loathsome than another to nose, ears, and eyes, and the taste of the mouth.

	body that had birth, and let there be nothing like it in
	the whole world; yet, unless the sum of matter be infinite from which it may be conceived and brought forth, it cannot be made, nor, moreover, can it grow and be nourished. Indeed, if I should go so far as to assume that the bodies generative of this one thing were finite in number, tossed about through the universe, whence, where, by what force, in what manner
	will they meet and combine amidst such an ocean of matter, such an alien crowd? They have no way, I think, to combine; but as when many great shipwrecks have come about, the high sea is accustomed to toss asunder transoms, ribs, yards, prow, masts,
	and oars all swimming, so that the poop-fittings are seen floating around all the shores, and provide a warning for mortals, that they eschew the treacherous deep, with her snares, her violence, and her fraud, and never trust her at any time when the calm sea shows her false alluring smile[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]: so if you once lay down that certain first-beginnings are finite in number, they must be scattered through all time and tossed asunder on the sundering tides of matter, so that never can they be driven together and come into combination together, nor remain in combination, nor grow by increase; both which things are openly shown by manifest facts to be done, namely that things can be brought forth and when produced can grow forth. It is therefore obvious that in each kind there is an infinity of the first-beginnings of things from which a supply of all things is brought up.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The cult of the [c dimgray]Magna Mater,[/c] Cybele, whom Lucr. identifies with Rhea (633-639), was brought to Rome from Phrygia in 205-204 b.c She was represented with a mural crown (606) and a team of lions (601). She had eunuch priests (614) called Corybantes, who worshipped her with loud, wild music (618-620) and frenzied armed dances (629-632). The similarity between her cult and that of Rhea caused them to be confused, and the Corybantes came to be identified with the Cretan Curetes (629, 633). The fact that both Phrygia and Crete possessed a Mt. Ida (611) contributed to the confusion.

	cymbals sound around, horns with hoarse-echoing blare affright, hollow pipes prick up the spirits with their Phrygian cadences, martial arms show a front
	of violent fury, that they may amaze the ungrateful minds and impious hearts of the vulgar with fear through the goddess’s majesty. Therefore as soon as she rides through mighty cities, silently blessing mankind with unspoken benediction, they bestrew the whole path of her progress with silver and copper, enriching it with bounteous largess, and snow down rose-flowers in a shower, over-shadowing the Mother and her escorting troop. Here an armed group, whom the Greeks name the Curetes, whenever they
	sport among the Phrygian bands and leap up rhythmically, joyful with blood, shaking their awful crests with the nodding of their heads, recall the Dictaean Curetes, who are said once upon a time to have concealed that infant wailing of Jupiter in Crete[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; when, boys round a boy in rapid dance, clad in armour, they clashed bronze upon bronze to a measure, that Saturn might not catch him and cast him into his jaws and plant an everlasting wound in the Mother’s heart.

	For the very nature of divinity must necessarily enjoy
	immortal life in the deepest peace, far removed and separated from our affairs; for without any pain, without danger, itself mighty by its own resources, needing us not at all, it is neither propitiated with services nor touched by wrath.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] The earth indeed
	lacks sensation at all times, and only because it receives into itself the first-beginnings of many things does it bring forth many in many ways into the sun’s light. Here if anyone decides to call the sea Neptune, and corn Ceres, and to misapply the name of Bacchus rather than to use the title that is proper to that liquor, let us grant him to dub the round world Mother of the Gods, provided that he forbears in reality himself to infect his mind with base superstition.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]661[/c]Often therefore cropping grass from one field,
	are woolly sheep and the warrior breed of horses and horned herds of cattle, beneath the same canopy of heaven, and quenching thirst from one river of water, which live each in a different shape and each race keeps its parents’ nature and imitates their ways after its kind: so great a diversity of matter is there in each kind of herbage, so great in each river.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]669[/c]Hence also any animal of them all is made up
	of bones, blood, veins, warmth, fluid, flesh, sinews; which are also things very different, made of first-beginnings that have dissimilar shapes.

According to Cicero, [c dimgray]Nat.

	[c dimgray]700[/c]However, it must not be thought that all can be

	white; as the sea, when great winds have stirred up the surface, turns into hoary waves with a white sheen; for you could say that often what we see as black, when its matter is mixed up and the order of its first-beginnings changed, some being added and taken away, immediately thereafter seems to be bright and white. But if the surface of the deep
	were made of blue seeds, it could not in any way become white; for however you may jumble up things that are blue, they can never change into a shining white colour. Or if different seeds that make up the sea’s uniform and pure brightness are steeped in different colours, just as often from different shapes and various figures something square is composed with a uniform figure, then it were fitting that, as in the square we perceive unlike forms to be contained,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] so on the surface of the deep or in any other pure and uniform brightness we should perceive various colours very different from one another. Besides, there is nothing in the unlike figures to hinder and debar the whole thing from being square on the outside; but the various colours of things do thwart and forbid the whole thing to be of one brightness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]788[/c]Then further, the reason that leads and attracts us sometimes to attribute colours to the first-beginnings of things falls to the ground, since white things are not made from white, nor what are black from black, but from diverse colours. The fact is that white things will arise much more easily from no colour than from black or from any other colour that fights against it and thwarts it.

	and the first-beginnings of things do not come out
	into the light, you may be sure that they are covered with no colour. For what colour can there be in blind darkness? Why, a colour is changed by the light itself, according as the brightness responds to a direct or oblique impact of light; in this way the dove’s plumage shows itself in the sun, lying about the nape and encircling the neck; for at times it is red as the blazing carbuncle, again view it in a certain way and it comes to appear a fusion of emerald green with blue. And the peacock’s tail, when it is suffused with plenteous light, in like manner changes the colours as it turns; and since these colours are caused by a certain impact of light, assuredly you must not think that they can be produced without it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]810[/c]And since the pupil of the eye receives one
	kind of blow when it is said to perceive a white colour, and quite another when it perceives black and all the rest, and since when you touch anything it matters nothing what chance colour the thing is of, but rather what shape it has, you may be sure that the first-beginnings have no need of colours, but that they give forth various kinds of touch with their various shapes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]817[/c]Besides, since no fixed colour is allotted to each
	fixed shape, and all configurations of first-beginnings may be found in any given hue, why are the things that consist of those shapes not likewise dyed in colours of all kinds in every kind of thing? For it were fitting that crows also as they fly should often throw off a white colour from white feathers, and

	[c dimgray]826[/c]Moreover, the more minute the particles into
	which anything is pulled apart, the more readily it is perceived that the colour gradually fades away and is extinguished; as happens when purple wool is torn up into small parts: the purple and the scarlet colour, brightest of all, is wholly destroyed when the wool has been pulled apart thread wise; so that you may learn from this that the particles breathe away all their colour before they are dispersed apart into the seeds of things.

	[c dimgray]834[/c]Lastly, since you grant that some bodies do

	from other \[sensible elements, make the seeds mortal\] in making them soft. For all sensation is therefore bound up with flesh, sinews, veins, all of which we mortal. see to be soft, and therefore to be concretions consisting of mortal substance.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]907[/c]However, let it even be granted that these
	can abide for ever: assuredly they must yet either have the sensation of a part, or be thought to be like whole animals. But it cannot be that parts have independent sensation; for every sensation in the frame has relation to something else: neither hand nor any part of the body at all, separated from us, can keep sensation alone. It remains that they be like whole animals. So they must have sensation in the same way that we have sensation, in order that they may be able to feel with us the life-giving sensations everywhere. How then will it be possible
	for them to be called first-beginnings of things, and to avoid the paths of death, when they are living things, and living things are one and the same as things mortal? And even supposing they could be so, yet by conjunction and combination they will produce nothing but a throng and crowd of living things, exactly as men, cattle, and wild beasts could not produce a new thing amongst themselves by coming together. But if by any chance they relinquish their own sensation from their body and receive another, of what use was it to attribute that which is taken away? Then besides, to return to an earlier example, inasmuch as we perceive birds’ eggs to turn into living chicks, and worms to seethe from

	the earth which putrefaction has affected after excessive rains, we may be sure that sensation can be produced from not-sensation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]931[/c]But if by any chance someone shall say[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] that
	sensation can at all events arise from not-sensation by a process of change or by some process like a birth by which it is brought forth, here is something that will be enough to make clear to him and to prove that birth does not take place unless there has been combination before, and that nothing changes except by combination.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]937[/c]In the first place, there can be no sensation in
	any body before the living being has been actually formed, because of course the matter is held dispersed abroad in air, rivers, earth, and what grows from the earth, and not having come together yet, it has not formed that combination of appropriate vital motions by which all-perceiving sensations being kindled protect each living thing.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]944[/c]Besides, in any living being a blow greater than
	nature can endure suddenly strikes it prostrate, and proceeds to confuse all sensations of body and mind. For the arrangements of the first-beginnings are broken up and the vital motions are utterly hindered, until the shock, diffused through all the substance of the frame, loosens from the body the vital knots of the soul, and ejects the soul scattered abroad through all the pores. For what else do we think the inflicted blow able to do, unless to strike all apart and to break it apart? It happens also that when
	the inflicted blow is less violent, the remaining vital

Lucr.’s reply to his opponent is that change or birth implies the existence of a union of particles, and that without a union of particles sensation is impossible.

	motions often prevail, they prevail and quiet the
	vast tumult of the blow, and call everything back again into its accustomed channels, and shake off the movement of death which already, as one may say, was lording it in the body, and once more kindle the sensations which were almost lost. For in what other way can living things come back from the very threshold of death into life, their minds collected again, rather than pass on to that goal whither their course was almost run, and pass away?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]963[/c]Besides, since there is pain when the bodies of
	matter, attacked by some force through the living flesh and limbs, tremble in their secret habitations within, and when they move back to their place comes soothing delight, you may be sure that the first-beginnings cannot be assailed by any pain, and from themselves can take no delight, since they are not composed of any bodies of elements, so as to be troubled by any strangeness in their motions or to take any enjoyment of life-giving delight; therefore they are bound not to be endowed with any sensation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]973[/c]Again, if sensation must really be attributed to
	their atoms, so that all living things may be able to feel, what of those from which the human race is grown in its proper way? Doubtless they shake trembling with laughter, they guffaw, they bedew face and cheeks with tears,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] they can discourse wisely at large on the composition of things, they go so far as to examine what their own first-beginnings are; since they resemble the whole mortal, they also must consist of other elements, then those of others, so that you dare not make a stand anywhere: for indeed I will follow you up; whatever you shall affirm to speak and laugh and be wise, shall be composed

	of other things doing the same. But if we perceive all this to be delirium and lunacy, and if one can laugh although not grown from laughing things, and can be wise and reason with learned sentences although not made of seeds that are wise and eloquent, why should not all we see capable of sensation be composed of seeds which altogether lack sensation?

	[c dimgray]991[/c]Lastly, we are all sprung from celestial seed[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c];

Nor does death so destroy things as to
	annihilate the bodies of matter, but it disperses their combination abroad; then it conjoins others with others, and brings it about that thus all things alter their shapes and change their colours and receive sensation and in a moment of time yield it up again; so that you may recognize how important it is with what and in what arrangement the same first-beginnings are held together, and what motions they give and receive mutually,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and that you may not believe it possible that the first bodies for ever hold

For, since the sum of space is infinite abroad beyond the walls of the world, the mind seeks to understand what is there in the distance whither the intelligence continually desires to look forth, and whither the mind’s projection[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] flies free of itself.

	[c dimgray]1048[/c]In the place, all around us in every direction
	and on both sides and above and below through the universe there is no limit: as I have shown,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and truth of itself cries aloud, and the nature of the unfathomable deep gives forth light. Now since there is illimitable space empty in every direction, and
	since seeds innumerable in number in the unfathomable universe are flying about in many ways driven in everlasting movement, it cannot by any means be thought likely that this is the only round earth and sky that has been made,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] that all those bodies of matter without do nothing: especially since this
	world was made by nature, and the seeds of things themselves of their own accord, knocking together by chance, clashed in all sorts of ways, heedless, without aim, without intention, until at length those combined which, suddenly thrown together, could become in each case the beginnings of mighty things, of earth and sea and sky and the generation of living creatures.

	point the life of all things must come to a stand, at this point nature by her power curbs back growth. For whatever you see growing with merry increase,
	and gradually climbing the steps of mature life, assimilates to itself more bodies than it discharges, so long as food is easily absorbed into all the veins, and so long as the things are not so widely spread open as to let go many elements and to spend away more than their age feeds on. For certainly we must own
	ourselves convinced that many elements flow out and pass away from things; but still more must be passed in, until they have touched the pinnacle of growth. After that by minute degrees age breaks the strength and mature vigour, and melts into decay. And indeed when growth ceases, the larger a thing is and the wider it is, the more particles it now scatters abroad on all sides and lets go from itself, nor is food easily sent abroad into all its veins, nor is this enough, in proportion to the abundant streams that it streams out, to enable as much to spring up and to be brought up in its place. With good reason therefore the things pass away, when by the flowing off they have become thinned, and all fall by blows from without, inasmuch as by great age food fails at last, nor is there anything which bodies buffeting from without cease to break up and to subdue with fatal blows.

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]In 5.783-825 Lucr. explains that the earth in her youth herself produced not only plants, but also all kinds of birds and animals, but that later (see 5.826-836), like a woman, she became effete, so that now she can only produce [c dimgray]animalia parva[/c](2.1151) such as worms [c dimgray](cf.[/c] 2.871–872, 898–901, 928–929, 3.719–736, 5.797–798).

	raise aloft a light so clear, illumining the blessings of life, you I follow, O glory of the Grecian race,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and now on the marks you have left I plant my own footsteps firm, not so much desiring to be your rival, as for love, because I yearn to copy you: for why should a swallow vie with swans, or what could a kid with its shaking limbs do in running to match himself with the strong horse’s vigour? You are our father, the discoverer of truths, you supply us with a father’s precepts, from your pages, illustrious man, as bees in the flowery glades sip all the sweets, so we likewise feed on all your golden words, your words of gold, ever most worthy of life eternal. For as soon as your reasoning begins to proclaim the

These same men, driven from their native land and banished far from the sight of men,
	stained with some disgraceful charge, in short afflicted with all tribulations, yet live; and in spite of all, wherever the wretches go they sacrifice to their ancestors, and slay black cattle, and send down oblations to the departed ghosts, and in their bitter days direct their minds far more eagerly to superstition. Thus it is more useful to scrutinize a man in danger or peril, and to discern in adversity what manner of man he is: for only then are the words of truth drawn up from the very heart, the mask is torn off, the reality remains.

	[c dimgray]59[/c]Moreover, avarice and the blind lust of distinction,
	which drive wretched men to transgress the bounds of law, and sometimes by sharing and scheming crime to strive night and day with exceeding toil to climb the pinnacle of power,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] these sores of life in no small degree are fed by the fear of death. For in general degrading scorn and bitter need are seen to be far removed from sweetness and stability of life, and a lingering as it were before the gates of death; from which men desiring to escape afar and to remove themselves far away, driven by false terror, amass wealth by civil bloodshed and greedily multiply riches, piling murder upon murder[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]; cruelly

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Empedocles regarded the blood around the heart as the seat of thought; Anaximenes and Diogenes of Apollonia identified the soul with air.

Some wear out their lives for the sake of a statue and a name. And often it goes so far, that for fear of death men are seized by hatred of life and of seeing the light, so that with sorrowing heart they devise their own death, forgetting that this fear is the fountain of their cares: it induces one man to violate honour, another to break the bonds of friendship, and in a word to overthrow all natural feeling; for often before now men have betrayed fatherland or beloved parents in seeking to avoid the regions of Acheron. For as children tremble and fear everything in the blind darkness, so we in the light sometimes fear what is no more to be feared than the things that children in the dark hold in terror and

	the feeling of the mind is not situated in any fixed part, but that it is a sort of vital condition of the body, called harmony[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] by the Greeks, which makes us live
	endowed with feeling, although the intelligence is not situated in any part; as when the body is often said to have good health, and yet this health is no part of the healthy creature. Thus they do not place the feeling of the mind in any fixed part; and in this they seem to me to wander very far astray. For
	indeed the body which we can see plain before us is often sick, although we are yet happy in the other part which lies hidden; and again it often happens that the contrary is true in its turn, when one wretched in mind is happy in all his body, not otherwise than if the sick man’s foot gives him pain when there is no pain meanwhile in the head. Besides,
	when the frame is given over to soft sleep, and the body lies outspread heavy and without sensation, there is yet something in us which at that time is agitated in many ways, and admits into itself all the motions of joy and cares of the heart, which have no meaning.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]117[/c]Next, that you may recognize that the spirit
	also lies within the frame and that it is not harmony that causes the body to feel, firstly it happens that if a great part of the body be taken away, yet life often remains in our frame; and again when a few particles of heat have dispersed abroad and air is driven out through the mouth, the same life in a moment deserts the veins and leaves the bones; so that from this you may recognize that not all particles
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]By “harmony” is meant a proper adjustment or “attunement” of the bodily constituents. The doctrine, which was probably influenced by both Pythagoreanism and Sicilian medical theory, is expounded in Plato’s [c dimgray]Phaedo[/c] (85 e—86 d) by Simmias and refuted there (91 c—95 a) by Socrates. In the fourth century b.c. it was developed by Aristoxenus and Dicaearchus. Aristoxenus was a musician, and Lucr.’s reference to musicians in 132 suggests that he is thinking chiefly of him ([c dimgray]cf.[/c] Cicero, [c dimgray]Tusc. Disp.[/c] 1.10.19).

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]130[/c]Therefore, since the nature of the mind and spirit
	has been round to be in some way a part or the man, give back the name of harmony, brought down to musicians from high Helicon,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] or perhaps the musicians themselves drew it from some other source and applied it to that which then lacked a name of its own. Be that how it may, let them keep it; do you now learn what else I have to say.

	[c dimgray]136[/c]Next, I say that mind and spirit are held in
	conjunction together and compound one nature in common, but that the head so to speak and lord over the whole body is the understanding which we call mind and intelligence. And this has its abiding-place
	in the middle region of the breast. For in this place throbs terror and fear, hereabouts is melting joy: here therefore is the intelligence and the mind. The rest of the spirit, dispersed abroad through the
	whole body, obeys and is moved according to the will and working of the intelligence. This alone by itself has sense, alone for itself rejoices, when nothing affects either spirit or body at the same time. And
	just as when head or eye is hurt by an attack of pain in us we are not tormented in the whole of our body, so the mind sometimes is hurt by itself, and is eager with joy, when the rest of the spirit throughout the limbs and frame is not stirred by any new sensation.

	of mind and spirit is bodily; for when it is seen to drive forward the limbs, to arouse the body from sleep, to change the countenance, to guide and steer[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] the whole man, and we see that none of these things can be done without touch, and further that there is no touch without body, must we not confess that mind and spirit have a bodily nature? Besides you perceive the mind to suffer along with the body, and
	to share our feeling in the body. If the grim force of a weapon driven deep to the dividing of bones and sinews fails to hit the life, yet a languor follows and a blissful[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] fall to the ground, and upon the ground a turmoil that comes about in the mind, and sometimes a kind of hesitating desire to rise. Therefore the nature of the mind must be bodily, since it suffers by bodily weapons and blows.

	[c dimgray]177[/c]Now I shall go on to explain to you, of what
	kind of body this mind is, and of what it is formed. First I say that it is exceedingly delicate and formed of exceedingly minute particles. That this is so, you may consider the following points to convince you. Nothing is seen to be done so swiftly as the mind
	determines it to be done and does its own first act[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; therefore the mind bestirs itself more quickly than any of these things which are seen plain before our eyes. But that which is so readily moved must consist of seeds exceedingly rounded and exceedingly minute, that they may be moved when touched by a small moving power. For water moves and flows
	with so very small a moving power because it is made of small rolling shapes. But on the other hand the nature of honey has more cohesion, its fluid is more sluggish, and its movement more tardy; for the whole mass of its matter coheres more closely, assuredly because it is not made of bodies so smooth or so delicate and round. For a checked and light breath of air can make, as you may see, a high heap of poppy-seed slip down from the top; but contrariwise
	it cannot stir a pile of stones or wheat-ears.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] So,
	according as bodies are extremely small and smooth, they have power of motion; but contrariwise, whatever is found to be more weighty and rough is by so much the more stable. Now, therefore, since the nature of the mind has been found to be moved with unusual ease, it must consist of bodies exceedingly

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]For the way in which mental visualization activates the body, see 4.877-906.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The reason being that, whereas poppy seeds are smooth, round, small, and light, stones are heavy and ears of corn spiky. The immovability of the objects in 198 is emphasized by the heavy spondees (contrast 196-197).

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]208[/c]Another thing also makes clear of how fine a
	texture it is, and in how small a space it might be contained if it could be gathered together; namely that as soon as death’s peaceful calm has taken possession of a man, when mind and spirit have departed, you could not perceive any jot or tittle to be diminished from the body whether in look or in weight: death presents all, except vital sense and warming heat. Accordingly the whole spirit must consist of very small seeds, being interlaced through veins, flesh, and sinews, since, when the whole has already departed from all the body, nevertheless the outward contour of the limbs presents itself undiminished, nor is one jot of the weight lacking; just as happens when the bouquet of wine has vanished,
	or when the sweet breath of ointment has dispersed into the air, or when the flavour has passed from a substance, and yet the thing itself does not seem any smaller to the eye for all that, nor is anything lost in the weight, because assuredly many minute seeds compose the flavour and the smell in the whole substance of the things. Therefore again and again I say, we may understand the substance of mind and spirit to be made of very minute seeds, since in departing it takes nothing from the weight.

	[c dimgray]231[/c]But we must not believe this nature to be
	single. For a kind of thin breath mixed with heat leaves the dying, and the heat, moreover, draws air with it. Nor is there any heat which is not mixed with air; for since its nature is rarefied, many first-beginnings

	of air must be moving through it. Already, therefore, the nature of the mind is found to be threefold; yet all these three together are not enough to produce feeling, since the mind cannot admit that any of these can produce sense-bringing motions and the thoughts which it itself revolves. A fourth nature must therefore be added to these;
	this is entirely without name[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; nothing exists more easily moved and more thin than this, or made of elements smaller and smoother; and this first distributes the sense-giving motions through the limbs. For this is first set in motion, being composed
	of small shapes; after that, heat takes on the movement, and the unseen power of wind, then the air; after which all is set in movement, the blood is agitated, the flesh is all thrilled through with feeling, last is communicated to bone and marrow it may be the pleasure, it may be the opposite excitement. Nor is it easy for pain to soak through thus far, or any violent mischief, without throwing all into so great a riot that no place is left for life, and the particles of spirit flee abroad through all the pores of the body. But usually there is an end to the movement almost at the surface of the body; on this account we are strong enough to retain life.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]262[/c]The first-beginnings of the elements so interpenetrate one another in their motions[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] that no single element can be separated off nor can its power act divided from the rest by space, but they are, as
	it were, the many forces[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] of a single body. Just as in the flesh of any living creature there is a scent and a certain heat and flavour, and yet from all these is made one body grown complete: so heat and air and the unseen power of wind commingled form one nature along with that quickly moving force, which from itself distributes amongst them[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] the beginning of motion, whence first the sense-bringing motion arises spreading through the flesh. For this nature
	lies deep down, hidden in the most secret recess, and there is nothing in our body more deeply seated than this[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]; and it is itself furthermore the spirit of the whole spirit. Just as commingled in our frame and in all our body the force of mind and the power of spirit lies hidden, because it is composed of small and scanty elements: so, I tell you, this force without name composed of minute particles lies hid, and is furthermore itself as it were spirit of the whole spirit and lords it in all the body. In like manner it is necessary that wind and air and heat interact commingled throughout the frame, one element yielding place to another or rising pre-eminent in

	[c dimgray]288[/c]The mind has also that heat, which it takes on
	when it boils in wrath and fire flashes more fiercely from the eyes; it has also abundance of that cold wind, fear’s comrade, which makes the limbs shiver and stirs the frame; it has too that quietude of calm air which comes about when the heart is tranquil and the countenance serene.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But there is more of the hot in those creatures whose bitter hearts and angry minds easily boil up in wrath. A notable instance of this is the violent fury of the lion,
	which so often bursts his breast with roaring and growling, nor can he find room in his heart for the storm of passion. But the cold mind of the stag has more of wind, and more speedily sends currents of cold
	breath through his flesh, which cause a tremulous movement to pervade the limbs. But the nature of the cow lives more by the peaceful air; never overmuch

	somewhat too soon by fear, a third put up with an affront more meekly than he should. And in many other respects the various natures of men must differ, and the habits that follow from them; I cannot now set forth the hidden causes of these, nor find names enough to fit the shapes assumed by the first-beginnings from which arises this variety in things. One thing I see that I can affirm in this regard is this: so
	trivial are the traces of different natures that remain, beyond reason’s power to expel, that nothing hinders faults. our living a life worthy of gods.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]323[/c]This nature[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] then is contained by the whole
	body, and is itself the body’s guardian and source of its existence; for they cling together with common roots, and manifestly they cannot be torn asunder without destruction.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Just as it is not easy to tear out the scent from lumps of frankincense, without its very nature being destroyed: so it is not easy to draw out mind and spirit from the whole body, without
	the dissolution of all. So interwoven are their elements from their first origin in the life which they live together; and we see that neither body nor mind has the power to feel singly without the other’s help, but by common motions proceeding from both conjointly sensation is kindled for us in our flesh.

	For it is not as when the liquid of water often throws off the heat which has been given to it,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and yet is not itself torn to pieces for that reason, but remains uninjured; not thus, I say, can the frame endure disruption apart from the spirit which has left it; but it is utterly undone, torn to pieces, and rots away. From the first moment of life, the interdependent contacts of body and spirit, while yet laid away in the mother’s body and womb, so learn the vital motions, that disruption apart cannot be without their ruin and damage; so that you may see that, since conjunction is necessary to their existence, so also theirs must be a joint nature.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]350[/c]Furthermore, if anyone denies that body can
	feel, and believes that it is the spirit mingled through-out with the body that takes on that motion which we name feeling, he fights against things that are quite manifest and true. For who will ever explain what it is for the body to feel, unless it be what experience has openly shown and taught us? “But the spirit gone, the body lacks feeling in every part.” Yes, for it loses that which in life was not its own property; as there are many other things that it loses[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] when it is driven from life.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]359[/c]Moreover, to say that the eyes can discern
	nothing, but that the mind looks out through them as through open portals,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] is difficult, when their own feeling leads us to the opposite conclusion; for it is their feeling that draws us and pushes us on to the very eyeballs; especially since we are often unable to perceive glaring objects because our bright eyes

	[c dimgray]370[/c]There is another thing, laid down by the revered
	judgement of the great Democritus,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] to which you could never assent: that the first-beginnings of body and of soul are placed one beside one alternately in pairs, and so link the frame together. For, as the
	elements of spirit are much smaller than those which compose our body and flesh, so they are fewer also in number[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and are dispersed at rare intervals through the frame; so that at least you may safely say that the first-beginnings of spirit lie at such intervals apart as equal the smallest things which falling upon us are able to awaken sense-bringing motions in our body.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] For sometimes we do not feel
	dust clinging to the body, or chalk[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] shaken on us settling on our limbs, nor do we feel the impact of a mist by night, or a spider’s gossamer threads when we are caught in their net as we go along, nor the withered vesture of the same creature falling on our head, nor birds’ feathers or flying thistle-down, which are so exceeding light that they usually find it a

Epicurus himself, despite his great debt to the earlier atomist, was not always so polite about him: [c dimgray]cf.[/c] Cicero, [c dimgray]Fin.[/c] 1.6.21, [c dimgray]Nat. D.[/c] 1.33.93.

However, there is a problem below; for, [c dimgray]among[/c] the examples [c dimgray]of[/c] objects whose impingement we do not feel, Lucr. mentions cobwebs, feathers, and thistle-down—all of which obviously extend over more space than the interval between two soul-particles, and are not felt because of their lightness rather than because of their smallness. Either, as Bailey suggests, Lucr. failed to see any difference between his examples; or, as Giussani thinks, he may have believed that there are no soul-particles on the absolute surface of the body.

But he remains in life to whom the mind and intelligence remains. He may be a mutilated trunk dismembered all about, the spirit removed all around and separated from the limbs, yet he lives and breathes the vital air. Deprived of a great part of the spirit, if not of all, yet he lingers and clings to life; just as when the eye is lacerated all round, if the pupil remains unhurt, there abides

	spread abroad and passes away far more quickly, and is more speedily dissolved into its first bodies,
	as soon as it has departed withdrawn from the limbs of a man. In fact if the body, which is in a way its vessel, cannot contain it, when once broken up by any cause and rarefied by the withdrawal of blood from the veins, how could you believe that it could be contained by any air, which is a more porous container than our body?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]445[/c]Besides, we feel that the mind is begotten along
	with the body, and grows up with it, and with it grows old. For as toddling children have a body infirm and tender, so a weak intelligence goes with it. Next, when their age has grown up into robust strength, the understanding too and the power of the mind is enlarged. Afterwards, when the body is now wrecked with the mighty strength of time, and the frame has succumbed with blunted strength, the intellect limps, the tongue babbles, the intelligence totters, all is wanting and fails at the same time. It follows therefore that the whole nature of the spirit
	is dissolved abroad, like smoke, into the high winds of the air, since we see it begotten along with the body, and growing up along with it, and as I have shown, falling to pieces at the same time worn out with age.

Further, groans are forced out, because the limbs are afflicted with pain, and in general because seeds of voice are ejected and rush forth from the mouth in a mass, where they have been, as it were, accustomed to pass, where is the established highroad. There is raving, because the strength of mind and spirit is set in a turmoil and, as I have shown,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] divided apart and separated up and drawn asunder by that same poison. Next, when the cause of the disease has already turned back, and the corroding humour of the diseased body has returned to its secret haunts,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] then first, staggering as it were, the man rises, and by degrees comes back to his full senses and receives back his spirit. Since, therefore, the mind and spirit are tossed about by so great diseases in the very body itself, and are miserably
	torn asunder and distressed, why do you believe that the same without body, in the open air, amidst mighty winds, are able to live?

	[c dimgray]510[/c]And since we see that the mind, like a sick

	or indeed to change any other nature whatever. But that which is immortal does not permit its parts to be transposed, or anything to be added, or one jot to ebb away; for whatever by being changed passes outside its own boundaries, at once that is death for that which was before.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Therefore, if the mind is sick, it gives indications of mortality, as I have shown, or if it is changed by medicine: so completely is the truth seen to combat false reasoning, and to cut off its retreat as it flies, and to convict falsehood by a double refutation.

	[c dimgray]526[/c]Furthermore, we often see a man pass away
	by degrees, and limb by limb lose the sensation of life: first the toes of the feet grow livid, and the nails, next die feet and legs, afterwards over the other limbs go creeping the cold footsteps of death.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Since in this case the substance of the spirit is divided and does not issue forth whole at one time, it must be considered to be mortal. But if by any
	chance you think that it can of its own accord pull itself inwards through the limbs and draw together its portions into one place, and that is how it withdraws sensation from all the limbs, then the place into which all that quantity of spirit is gathered together ought to seem more sensitive; but since this place is nowhere to be found, undoubtedly, as I said before,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] the spirit is torn to pieces and dispersed abroad, perishes therefore.

	within the bounds of life, nevertheless, when weakened
	by some cause or other, it often appears to wish to depart and to be released from the whole body, and the countenance appears to grow languid as at the last hour, and all the limbs to relax and droop from the bloodless body. This is what happens when the phrase is used “the mind fails” or “the spirit faints”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]: when all is trepidation, and all those present desire to pull back again the last bond of life. For at that time the intelligence and all the power of the spirit are shaken altogether, and these fail together with the body itself, so that a slightly more serious cause could dissolve them. Why then
	after all do you doubt that, when driven without the body, weak, outside, in the open, without a covering, the spirit could not only not endure through all time, but could not last even for the smallest space?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]607[/c]It is evident that no one in dying feels his soul
	go forth from the whole body intact, nor rise first to the throat and then pass up to the gullet; rather he feels it tail m the particular region where it is located, as he knows his other senses to be dispersing abroad each in its own part. But if our intelligence were immortal, in dying it would not so much complain of dispersing abroad, but rather of passing out and quitting its vesture, like a snake.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]615[/c]Again, why are the mind’s intelligence and understanding never produced

	assigned to each thing for its birth and a place where it may endure when made, with its manifold limbs being arranged in such a way that their order is never reversed? So surely one thing follows another; neither is flame accustomed to be produced from streams, nor frost in fire.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]624[/c]Besides, if the nature of the spirit is immortal
	and can feel when separated from our body, we must, I think, assume that it is endowed with the five senses; in no other way can we imagine the spirits below to be wandering in Acheron. Painters[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] therefore, and the earlier generations of writers,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] have introduced the spirits thus provided with senses. But apart from the body there can never be either eyes or nose or hand by itself for the spirit, nor tongue apart from the body, nor ears; therefore spirits by themselves cannot either have sensation or exist.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]634[/c]And since we feel that vital sense inheres in
	the whole body, and see that it is the whole that is animated, if suddenly some force with a swift blow shall cut the body through the middle so as to sever the two parts asunder, there is no doubt that spirit also will be sundered apart and cleft apart and cut apart with the body.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] But that which is cleft and divided into parts assuredly renounces all claim to be everlasting.

	[c dimgray]642[/c]They tell how scythed chariots,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] reeking with
	indiscriminate slaughter, often shear off a limb so suddenly that it is seen to quiver on the ground when it falls shorn from the trunk, although the man’s mind and strength can feel no pain, from the swiftness of the blow, and at the same time because the mind is absorbed in the ardour of battle; with what is left of his body he pursues battle and blood, and does not observe that his left arm, it may be, with its shield has been carried off amidst the horses by the wheels and their ravening scythes, or another that his right arm has fallen while he climbs and presses on.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Then another essays to rise with a leg lost, while the dying foot hard by on the ground twitches its toes. Even the head shorn off from the hot and living trunk retains on the ground the look of life and its open eyes, until it has rendered up all that is left of the spirit.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]War-chariots equipped with scythes were an oriental invention, and were never adopted by the Greeks or Romans (hence [c dimgray]memorant,[/c] 642). They are first mentioned by Xeno-phon, [c dimgray]An.[/c] 1.8.10; Livy, 37.41.7, mentions their use in the war with Antiochus III; and they and their effectiveness are described by the first century a.d. historian Q.

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c][c dimgray]i.e.[/c] the soldier, who has lost his arm in climbing up to attack the driver of a scythed chariot, continues his attack.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The meaning of [c dimgray]utrumque[/c] is uncertain. Does it refer to both the front and back part of the snake’s body? Or does it mean, as supposed by Diels (in his translation) and W. S. M. Nicoll, [c dimgray]CR[/c] N.S. 20 (1970) 140–141, both body and soul of the snake? The former interpretation derives support from 637, 657–658 (where Lucr. stresses head and tail as well as body) and [c dimgray]662[/c]; the latter from 668–669, for there [c dimgray]utrumque[/c] certainly refers to body and soul, and the parallelism between [c dimgray]in multas[/c] . . . [c dimgray]partis disciditur[/c] (669) and [c dimgray]in multas partis discidere[/c] (658) might be taken as indicating that [c dimgray]utrumque[/c] has the same reference in both places. In any case, no emendation of the text is necessary.

	each of these fractions? But in that way it will follow that one living creature had many spirits in its body. Therefore that spirit which was one has been divided apart together with the body; and so each must be considered mortal, since each alike is cut asunder into many parts.

	[c dimgray]670[/c]Besides, if the nature of the spirit is immortal
	and creeps into the body as we are born, why can we not remember also the time that has passed before, and why do we keep no traces of things done? For if the power of the mind has been so greatly changed that it has lost all recollection of things done, that, I think, is not far removed from death. Therefore you must confess that the spirit that was before has perished, and that which now is has now been made.

	[c dimgray]679[/c]Besides, if the body is already complete when
	the quickened power of the mind is accustomed to be introduced into us, at the moment when we are born and when we enter the threshold of life, it ought not so to live that it should be seen to grow with the body and together with the frame in the very blood, but it should live alone by itself as it might be in a cage, while nevertheless all the body should be full of streams of sensation. Therefore again and again I say that spirits must not be considered to be without beginning or free from the law of death. For we must not believe that they could have been so closely connected with our bodies if they had been introduced from without, when experience
	manifestly proves the clean contrary; for the spirit is so closely connected with the body through all the veins, flesh, sinews, and bones that

The spirit is distributed through all the pores of the body; just as food, while it is being dispersed into all the members and limbs, perishes and supplies another nature from its substance, so spirit and mind, even though they enter whole into a new body, yet in permeating it are dissolved, while the particles are being dispersed through all the pores, as we may call them, into the limbs, those particles that compose this mind which now lords it in our body, born of that mind which perished at the time when it was distributed through the limbs.

	left in the body no particles of itself, how do corpses

	spirits can creep into the worms from without and come one by one into the bodies, if you do not ponder why many thousands of spirits gather together where one has gone away, Here is a question that it seems worth while to ask and to bring under examination,
	whether in fact the spirits go a-hunting for all the seeds of little worms and themselves make them a habitation, or whether they creep as it were into bodies already formed. But there is no answer to the question why they should make bodies themselves, or why they should take that trouble. For,
	when they are without bodies, they are not plagued with disease as they fly about, or with cold and hunger; for it is the body rather that is troubled through susceptibility to these infirmities, and the mind suffers many maladies by contact with it. Grant, however, that it be as useful as you will that these make them a body to enter: but how they can, there is no way to be seen. Spirits therefore do not make themselves bodies and limbs. Nor is there any possibility that they creep into bodies already made; for they will not be able to conjoin themselves closely together with these, nor will harmony be established through community of sensation.

	why are all other qualities of this sort generated in the body and the character from the beginnings of life, if not because in each seed and breed its own fixed power of mind grows along with each body? But if it were immortal, and accustomed to pass from body to body, living creatures would show confused habits: the dog of Hyrcanian breed[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] would often
	flee before the horned stag’s onset; the hawk would tremble, flying through the air from the advancing dove; men would lack reason, the wild generations of wild beasts would have it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]754[/c]For it is based on false reasoning to say that an
	immortal spirit is altered by a change of body; for that which changes is dissolved, therefore perishes, The parts of the spirit are transposed, and move from their position; therefore they must be capable of being dissolved also through the frame, to perish at last one and all with the body.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]760[/c]But if they say that the spirits of men always
	pass into men’s bodies, I will still ask why a foolish spirit can be made of a wise one, why no child is ever prudent, and no foal ever so accomplished as the horse of powerful strength.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] No doubt they will take refuge in saying that in a tender body the mind becomes tender. But even if this is so, you must confess that the spirit is mortal, since being changed so completely throughout the body it loses its former life and feeling.

	[c dimgray]769[/c]Or how will the power of the mind be able to

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The dogs of Hyrcania, on the south-east shore of the Caspian Sea, were noted for their ferocity. According to Cicero ([c dimgray]Tusc. Disp.[/c] 1.45.108), the Hyrcanians thought that the best method of burial was to be torn to pieces by their dogs, and kept them especially for this purpose.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The mention of the horse shows that the supposition with which Lucr. is dealing is that souls of all animals, and not only human souls, remain constant to the same species.

	to issue forth from a frame grown old? Does it fear to remain imprisoned in a putrefying corpse, fear lest
	its house, worn out with the long lapse of years, fall in upon it? But there are no dangers for the immortal.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]776[/c]Again, to suppose that spirits stand ready for the
	amours and the parturition of wild beasts is plainly too ridiculous—immortal spirits awaiting mortal frames in number numberless, and struggling together in hot haste which first and foremost shall creep in; unless perhaps the spirits have contracts so arranged, that the spirit which comes flying up first may creep in first, and they need not come to blows one whit.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]784[/c]Again, a tree cannot grow in the sky,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] nor
	clouds be in the deep sea, nor fish live in the fields, nor can blood be in sticks nor sap in rocks. It is fixed and arranged where each thing is to grow and have its being. So the nature of the mind cannot arise alone without body, nor exist far from sinews and blood. But if it could do this, the power of the mind itself could much more easily be in head or shoulders or the heels of the feet, and be born in any part, and at least remain in the same man, the same vessel.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]But since even in our body there is seen to be a fixed rule and ordinance in what place mind and spirit may exist and grow apart, so much the more must we deny that they can endure and be produced wholly outside the body. Therefore, when the body has perished, you must confess that the spirit has passed away, torn to pieces throughout the body.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]784–797 are repeated, with slight alterations, in 5.128–141, where Lucr. is arguing that the earth, sea, sky, sun, moon, and stars are not animate, let alone divine.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The argument of 790–793 is this: if the mind could exist outside the body, then, rather than do this, it would be more likely to be found in some part of the body where in fact it cannot exist; in fact, it can only exist in the breast.

	[c dimgray]800[/c]In fact, to yoke mortal with immortal, and to
	think that they can be partners in feeling and act upon each other, is folly; for what can be considered more discordant, more contradictory or inconsistent, than that what is mortal can be yoked together in combination with immortal and imperishable, to weather furious storms!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]806[/c]Besides, whatever bodies abide everlasting must
	either, being of solid structure, reject blows and allow nothing to penetrate them that could dissever asunder the close-joined parts within, as the particles of matter are, the nature of which we have shown before; or else the reason why they can endure
	through all time must be that they are free from assaults, as the void is, which remains untouched and is not a whit affected by blows; or again because
	there is no extent of space around into which things can as it were disperse and dissolve, as the sum of all sums[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] is eternal, and there is no place without it into which its elements may escape, nor bodies to fall upon it and dissolve it asunder with a strong blow.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]819[/c]But if possibly the reason why the spirit is to
	be held immortal is rather this,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] that it is sheltered and protected by the forces of life, either because nothing comes at all that is hostile to its existence,

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]806–818 recur, with a few minor alterations, in 5.351–363, where Lucr. is arguing that the world is not eternal. Since the lines are better adjusted to their context in Book 5, it is reasonable to assume that Lucr. first wrote them there, and later inserted them here when it struck him that they were relevant to his argument for the mortality of the soul. It is probable that, if he had lived to complete the revision of his work, he would have incorporated the passage in its new context more satisfactorily, pointing out that since the soul does not satisfy any of the three conditions of immortality, it must be mortal.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]It is probable that in 819–823 Lucr. is alluding, as Giussani suggests, to the condition of the immortality of the gods, who continually gain new atoms to replace those which they lose, and who survive a constant atomic bombardment in the [c dimgray]intermundia.[/c]

	or because all that does come goes back, in some way repulsed before we can perceive what harm it does, \[experience manifestly shows that this cannot be true.\] For not to mention that it sickens along with bodily disease, something often comes that torments it about the future, keeps it miserable in fear, wearies it with anxiety, and, when there has been evil done in the past, its sins bring remorse. Add madness which is peculiar to the mind, and forgetfulness of all things, add that it is drowned in the black waters of lethargy.

	who by the welding and wedding together of body
	and spirit exist compacted into one whole. Even if time should gather together our matter after death and bring it back again as it is now placed, and if once more the light of life should be given to us, yet it would not matter one bit to us that even this had been done, when the recollection of ourselves has once been broken asunder. And even now we are not concerned at all about any self which we have been before, nor does any anguish about it now touch us. For when you look back upon all the past expanse of measureless time, and think how various are the motions of matter, you may easily come to believe that these same seeds of which now we consist have been often before placed in the same arrangement they now are in. And yet we cannot call that back by memory; for in between has been cast a stoppage of life,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and all the motions have wandered and scattered afar from those sensations.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]870[/c]Accordingly, when you see a man resenting his
	fate, that after death he must either rot with his body laid in the tomb, or perish by fire or the jaws of wild beasts,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] you may know that he rings false, and that deep in his heart is some hidden sting, although himself he deny the belief in any sensation after death. He does not, I think, admit what he professes to admit, nor the premise from which his profession is derived[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; he does not wholly uproot and eject himself from life, but unknown to himself he makes something of himself to survive. For when
	anyone in life anticipates that birds and beasts will mangle his body after death, he pities himself; for he does not distinguish himself from that thing,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] he does not separate himself sufficiently from the body there cast out, he imagines himself to be that and, standing beside it, infects it with his own feeling. Hence he resents that he was born mortal, and does not see that in real death there will be no other self that could live to bewail his perished self, or stand by to feel pain that he lay there lacerated or burning. For[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] if after death it is an evil to be mauled by the jaws and teeth of wild beasts, I do not see how it should not be unpleasant to be laid upon the fire and to shrivel in the hot flames, or to be packed in honey

	after death their chief trouble will be to be miserably consumed and parched by a burning thirst, a craving possess them for some other thing! In fact, no one feels the want of himself and his life when both mind and body alike are quiet in sleep; for all we care that sleep might be everlasting, and no craving for ourselves touches us at all; and yet those first-beginnings dispersed through our body are not straying far from sense-giving motions at the time when a man, startled from sleep, gathers himself together.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Death therefore must be

	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]Kenney has rightly argued that [c dimgray]volucres,[/c] which in 984 = “birds,” here (993) refers to the [c dimgray]Cupidines[/c] or “Loves.” See his commentary and, for a fuller discussion, [c dimgray]PCPS[/c] N.S. 16 (1970) 44–47. However, it should be noted that the meaning had already been understood by Pius, who comments on [c dimgray]volucres[/c]: “curae et alati cupidines.”
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]For the punishment of Sisyphus, [c dimgray]cf.[/c] Homer, [c dimgray]Od.[/c] 11.593–600, whom Lucr. follows.
	[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]Again ([c dimgray]cf.[/c] 983, 992–994) a double meaning: [c dimgray]plani raptim petit aequora campi[/c] suggests the candidate ([c dimgray]petitor[/c]) hurrying back to the Campus Martius to seek re-election (see D. West, [c dimgray]The Imagery and Poetry of Lucretius[/c] 102). For the likelihood that a passage about Ixion has dropped out after 1002, see esp. H. D.

The son of the house of Scipio, thunderbolt
	of war,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] terror of Carthage, gave his bones to the earth as though he had been the humblest menial. Add the inventors in the worlds of science and beauty,

	again, when ripe old age warned him that the recording motions of his mind[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] were beginning to fail, of his own free will himself offered his head to death. Epicurus himself died when the light of life had run its course,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] he whose intellect surpassed humanity, who quenched the light of all as the risen sun of heaven quenches the stars.

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Probably an imitation of Ennius (the end of 1035 is from [c dimgray]Ann.[/c] 313V). Munro thinks that the comparison may have been suggested by a false derivation of Scipio from σκηπτός (= “thunderbolt”).

	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The Muses.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]Lucr. appropriately uses the language of an atomist to describe the failing powers of Democritus, who is said to have starved himself to death ([c dimgray]cf.[/c] 1041).
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]The only mention of Epicurus’ name in the entire poem. The editors point out that [c dimgray]decurso lumine[/c] is a mixture of two metaphors, [c dimgray]decurso spatio[/c] and [c dimgray]extincto lumine.[/c] The combination results naturally from the conception of the sun (to which Epicurus is compared) as both lamp and chariot(eer): [c dimgray]cf. e.g.[/c] 5.397–404. 1043–1044 almost certainly owe something to the epigram on Homer by Leonidas of Tarentum [c dimgray](Anth.

	forge for ourselves any new pleasure; but while we have not what we crave, that seems to surpass all else; afterwards, when we have attained that, we crave something else; one unchanging thirst of life fills us and our mouths are for ever agape. And it is uncertain what fortune the next years may bring, what chance has in store, what end awaits us. And
	by protracting life we do not deduct one jot from the duration of death, nor are we able to diminish that, so as to leave perhaps a shorter time after our taking off. Therefore you may live to complete as many generations as you will: nevertheless that everlasting death will still be waiting, and no less long a time will he be no more, who has made an end of life with to-day’s sun, than he who fell many a month and year before.

I love to approach virgin springs, and there to drink; I love to pluck new flowers, and to seek an illustrious chaplet for my head from fields whence before this the Muses have crowned the brows of none: first because my teaching is of high matters, and I proceed to set free the mind from the close knots of superstition; next because the subject is so dark and the verses I write so clear, touching every part with the Muses’ grace. For even this seems not to be out of place; but as with children, when physicians try to administer rank wormwood, they first touch the rim of the cups all about with the sweet yellow fluid of honey, that unthinking childhood may be deluded as far as the lips, and meanwhile that they may drink up the bitter juice of wormwood, and though beguiled be not betrayed, but rather by such means be restored and regain health, so now do I: since this doctrine commonly seems somewhat harsh to those who have not used it, and the people shrink back from it, I have chosen to set forth my doctrine to you in sweet-speaking Pierian song, and as it were to touch it with the Muses’ delicious honey, if by chance in such a

	[c dimgray]26[/c]Now, since I have explained what is the nature
	of the mind, from what elements it takes its strength when combined with the body, and how when torn away from the body it returns to its first elements, you shall now see me begin to deal with what is of high importance for this subject, and to show that there exist what we call images[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] of things; which, like films[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] drawn from the outermost surface
	of things, flit about hither and thither through the air; it is these same that, encountering us in wakeful hours, terrify our minds, as also in sleep, when we often behold wonderful shapes and images of the dead, which have often aroused us in horror while we lay languid in sleep[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]; lest by chance we should think that spirits escape from Acheron or ghosts flit about amongst the living, or that anything of us can be left after death, when body and mind both taken off together have dissolved abroad, each into its own first-beginnings. I say, therefore, that semblances and thin shapes of things are thrown off from their outer surface. This can be recognized by the dullest brain from what follows.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]54[/c]In the first place, since amongst visible things
	many throw off bodies, sometimes loosely diffused abroad, as wood throws off smoke and fire heat, sometimes more close-knit and condensed, as often when cicadas drop their neat coats in summer, and when calves at birth throw off the caul from their outermost surface, and also when the slippery serpent casts off his vesture amongst the thorns (for we often see the brambles enriched with their flying spoils): since these things happen, a thin image must also be thrown off from things, from the outermost surface of things. Why thin films should not fall and be thrown off from, things as much as those others,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] no one could whisper a reason, especially since there are numerous minute bodies on the outermost side of things, which can be cast off in the same arrangement they were in before, preserving the shape of the object, and far more quickly, as, being few[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and

	stationed in the front rank, they are less able to be impeded. For assuredly we see many things cast off particles with lavish bounty, not only from the depths and from within (as we said before)[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but from the outermost surface, amongst others colour not
	seldom. This is often done by yellow and red and dark purple awnings, when outspread in the public view over a great theatre[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] upon posts and beams surface; they tremble and flutter; for then they dye, and force to flutter in their own colour, the assembly in the great hollow below, and all the display of the stage . . . . . . .; and the more the walls of the theatre are enclosed all round, the more all within laughs in the flood of beauty when the light of day is thus confined. Therefore, since canvas throws off colour from its outermost surface, everything else must also cast off thin
	semblances, because in each case they throw off from the outermost surface. There are therefore fixed outlines of shapes and of finest texture which flit about everywhere, but singly and separately cannot be seen.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]90[/c]Besides, all smell, smoke, heat and other such things stream away from objects all diffused abroad, for this reason, because they arise from the depths, and as they come forth they are torn up in their tortuous course, there being no direct openings to the paths to let them push out together when they have

	in water, in any bright surface, since they are possessed of the same appearance as the things, must consist of images thrown off from those things.

	[c dimgray]143[/c]Now \[let me tell you\] how easily and quickly
	these images arise, constantly flowing off from things and gliding away.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For there is always something streaming from the outermost surface of things for them to shoot off. And this when it meets some
	things passes through, particularly through glass. But when it meets rough stone or solid wood, there at once it is broken, so that it can give back no image. But when the opposed object is bright and compact, as particularly a mirror, nothing happens of this sort; for the images cannot pass through as through glass, nor again can they be broken: so much safety the smoothness never forgets to afford. Therefore it follows that the images stream back from it upon us. And no matter how suddenly you
	place any object before a mirror at any time, its image appears, so that you may recognize that there is a constant flow from the surface of things of thin textures and thin shapes. Therefore many images arise in brief space, so that there is good reason to call the origin of these things rapid. And just as the
	sun must send up many lights in brief space, that all places may be full of them without a break, so in like manner from things also it must be that in a moment of time many images pass off in many ways and in all directions everywhere, since in whatever direction we tum the mirror to the shapes of things, something answers back of like form and colour.

	the clearest, all on a sudden the sky becomes ugly
	and turbid, so that you might think all the darkness had deserted Acheron from all sides and filled full the great caverns of the sky: so completely has the loathsome night of clouds gathered together, and black faces of fear hang over us on high[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]: of which clouds how small a fraction the image is, no man can tell or [c dimgray]give[/c] any reasonable account.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]176[/c]Now listen: how rapid is the motion which
	carries the images along, and what velocity has been given to them in swimming through the air, so that but a brief time is spent over a long space,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] to whatever part they tend with diverse inclination, this I will tell in verses few but sweet-voiced, as the short song of the swan is better than that honking of cranes, spread abroad in the skyey clouds of the south.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]183[/c]In the first place, you may very often see that
	things light and made of minute elements are rapid. An example of these is the sun’s light and his heat, because they are made of minute elements, which are as it were beaten with knocks, and do not hesitate to pass through the intervening air when struck by the blow of that which follows; for instantly light comes up behind light, and flash is pricked on by flash, as in a long team.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] Therefore the images in like manner must be able to run through space inexpressible by words in a moment of time, first because

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The argument of 174-175 is compressed. The idea is that, if clouds can be formed so swiftly, the images (which are far, far smaller than clouds) will be formed with almost unimaginable rapidity.

The new passage should begin before 217, but after 216, the opening of it being lost. 217-229 are repeated, with a few minor variations, in 6.923-935, and the reviser of this work thinks it most probable that[/c] 217 [c dimgray]was preceded by two lines identical or almost identical to 6.921-922, and that those two lines were preceded by lines in which the new subject was introduced. Moreover, if the loss[/c] [c dimgray]of a page of the archetype was responsible for the disappearance of the lines, it is possible that we have also lost an argument that intervened between the passage on the speed of the films and the passage on effluences[/c]

	there is a very small impulse[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] far behind which carries them on and pushes them on, also because they move with so swift a lightness, next because they are emitted with such a rarefied texture that they can easily penetrate anything, and as it were ooze through the intervening air.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]199[/c]Besides, if those particles of things that are
	sent forth from their depths, like the sun’s light and heat, are observed to glide and diffuse themselves abroad in a moment of time through the whole space of heaven, to fly over the sea and land and to flood the sky, what then of those which are ready on the very outside, when they are cast off and nothing impedes their discharge? Do you not see that they must travel so much the faster and farther, and run over many times the space in the same time as the sun’s light takes to spread abroad over the sky?

	[c dimgray]209[/c]This further seems a true and pre-eminent indication
	to show with how rapid a motion the images are borne along, that as soon as the brightness of water is laid in the open air under a starry sky, at once the serene constellations of the firmament answer back twinkling in the water.

	In the first place, from everything we see there
	must of necessity continually flow and discharge and scatter\][c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] bodies which strike our eyes and vision. And there is a continual flow of odours from certain things, as there is of cold from rivers, heat from the sun, surge from the waves of the sea, that devourer of walls about the shore. Manifold voices
	also fly through the air without ever slackening. Again, a moisture salt to the taste often comes into our mouth when we walk by the sea, and when we see wormwood being mixed with water in our presence, we have a sense of bitterness. So true it is that from all things the different qualities pass off in a flow, and disperse in every direction around; there is no delay, no rest to interrupt the flow, since we constantly feel it, and we can at all times see all things, smell them, and perceive their sound.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]230[/c]Besides, since a shape handled in the dark is
	recognized to be the same which is seen in the clear light by day, it must be that touch and sight are moved by a like cause. Now, therefore, if we take hold of something square and it excites our feeling in the dark, in the light what square thing can fall upon our vision, if not an image of it? Therefore there is seen to be in images a cause of vision, and without these nothing can be seen.

	can perceive them, therefore it happens that where we tum our sight, there all things strike upon it with shape and colour.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]244[/c]And the image enables us to see and takes care
	that we distinguish how far each thing is distant from us; for when it is sent off, at once it pushes and drives all the air that is between itself and our eyes, and thus this air all streams through our eyes and, as it were, brushes the pupils and thus passes through. This is how we come to see how far off each thing is; and the more air is driven before it, the longer the breeze that brushes our eyes, the more distant and far removed the thing is seen to be. Assuredly all
	this passes in a supremely rapid manner, so that we see all at once both what it is and how far away.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]256[/c]But in this regard it should not be thought at all wonderful why the objects themselves[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] are per ceived, and yet the images that strike our eyes cannot be seen singly. For when the wind also beats
	upon us little by little, and when sharp cold flows upon us, we are not accustomed to feel every single particle of that wind and that cold, but rather the whole at once, and we see that the blows take effect upon our body exactly as if some object were striking us and giving us the feeling of its own body outside. Besides, when we knock a stone with a toe, we touch just the uppermost surface of the stone, and the outermost colour, but we do not feel this by the touch, but rather we perceive the real hardness of the stone in its inmost depths.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]269[/c]Now listen while I tell why the image is seen
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Strictly speaking, we never see an object itself, but only the image produced by the continuous stream of [c dimgray]simulacra[/c] from the object.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]This example is more complex. We touch the surface colour, but we feel hardness (not the colour) by the combined effects of the lower strata.

	withdrawn. It is the same as with those objects which are seen in their reality[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] through the doors outside, when the doorway provides an open view through it and allows us to see from the house many things outside. For this vision also is brought about
	by two distinct stretches of air; for first in this case is seen the air on this side of the doors, next follows the door itself right and left leaf, afterwards the external light brushes the eyes, and the other air, and those things which are seen in their reality through the doors outside. So when the image of the mirror has first thrown itself forwards, while it is on the way to our eyes, it pushes and drives all the air that is between itself and our eyes, and makes us able to perceive all this before we perceive the mirror; but when we have perceived the mirror itself also, at once the image which is carried from us to the mirror reaches it, and being flung back, comes back to our eyes, rolling and propelling before it another air, and makes us see this before we see itself; and that is why it seems to be withdrawn so far off from the mirror. Therefore again and again I say, it is by no means right to wonder \[that this happens both to those things which are seen through doors and also\][c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] to those things which give back a vision from the surface of a mirror, since the whole is done by two airs in each case.

	[c dimgray]302[/c]An image may also be transmitted from mirror

For whatever lies hidden behind in the inner parts of a house, however tortuous and secluded be the ways in between, may yet be all brought out through these involved passages by means of a number of mirrors and seen to be in the house. So truly does the image shine across from mirror to mirror; and when it has been presented left, it becomes right again, then once more it comes back again and returns to the same position.

	[c dimgray]324[/c]Bright objects, moreover, the eyes avoid and
	try not to see. The sun actually blinds if you persist in staring against it, because its own power is great, and from on high through the pure air the images come heavily rushing, and strike the eyes so as to disturb their structure. Besides, whatever brightness is fierce often burns the eyes, because it contains many seeds of fire which cause pain to the eyes by penetrating.

	[c dimgray]332[/c]Moreover, jaundiced persons see everything a

	light, and provoke us to see. But contrariwise we
	cannot see out of the light what is in the darkness, for this reason, because a grosser air of the darkness follows second, which nils all pores and besets the passages of the eyes, that no images of anything when thrown upon them may move them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]353[/c]And when afar off we see the foursquare towers
	of a city, they often appear to be round, for this reason, because every angle at a distance is seen blunted or rather it is not seen at all, its blow is lost and the stroke does not glide across to our eyes; because, while the images are rushing through a great space of air, the air with frequent buffetings forces it to become blunt. By this means when every angle at once has escaped our vision, the stone structures appear as though rounded on a lathe; not, however, like things that are close before us and really round, but they appear somewhat similar in a shadowy fashion.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]364[/c]Our own shadow also appears to move in

For there are always new rays of light pouring out, and the first disappear

	with sweet drowsiness, and our whole body lies in profound quiet, yet we seem to ourselves then to be awake and to move our limbs, and in the blind darkness of night we think that we see the sun and the light of day, and we seem to exchange our narrow room for sky and sea, rivers and mountains,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and traverse plains afoot, and to hear sounds though the stern silence of night reigns everywhere, and to utter speech while saying nothing.

	[c dimgray]462[/c]We see in marvellous fashion many things besides
	of this kind, which all try as it were to break the credit of our senses; but all in vain, since the most part of them deceives because of opinions of the mind which we bring to them ourselves, so that things are held to be seen which have not been seen by our senses. For nothing is more difficult than to distinguish plain things from doubtful things which the mind of itself adds at once.

	[c dimgray]469[/c]Moreover, if anyone thinks that nothing is

	[c dimgray]478[/c]You will find that it is from the senses in the
	first instance that the concept of truth has come, and that the senses cannot be refuted.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] For some standard must be found of greater credit, able of itself to refute false things by true. What, moreover, must be held to be of greater credit than the senses? Shall reasoning, derived from false sense, prevail
	against these senses, being itself wholly derived from the senses? For unless they be true, all reasoning is false. Will the ear be able to convict the eye, or the touch the ear? Will the taste of the mouth again refute the touch, will nose confound it, or eye disprove it? Not so, I think. For each has its own separate function, each its own power, and it is therefore necessary to decide what is soft and cold or hot by a separate sense, and by a separate sense to perceive the various colours of things and to see whatever is involved in colour.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] For the taste of the mouth has power on a separate sense, smell arises for a separate sense, sound for another. Therefore it is necessary that one sense cannot refute another. Nor furthermore will they be able to convict themselves,
	since equal credit must always be allowed to them.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Accordingly, what has seemed to these at any given time to be true, is true.

	one who finds no reason explain the shape of either figure in a faulty manner, rather than anywhere to let slip from your hands the holdfast or the obvious,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and to break the credit from which all begins, and to tear up all the foundations upon which life and existence rest. For not only would all reasoning come to ruin, but life itself would at once collapse, unless you make bold to believe the senses, avoiding precipices and all else that must be eschewed of that sort, and following what is contrary. Therefore, believe me, vain is all that array of words which has been prepared and marshalled against the senses.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]513[/c]Lastly, as in a building, if the original rule[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] is
	warped, if the square is faulty and deviates from straight lines, if the level is a trifle wrong in any part, the whole house will necessarily be made in a faulty fashion and be falling over, warped, sloping, leaning forward, leaning back, all out of proportion, so that some parts seem about to collapse on the instant, and some do collapse, all betrayed by false principles at the beginning. So therefore your reasoning about things must be warped and false whenever it is based upon false senses.

	[c dimgray]528[/c]Besides, the voice often scrapes the gullet, and
	a cry issuing forth makes the windpipe rougher; for when the first-beginnings of voice gathering in larger quantity begin to issue forth through the narrow passage, naturally the gateway of the mouth also is scraped when the gullet is filled full. There is therefore no doubt that voices and words to be able to hurt consist of bodily elements.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]535[/c]Nor do you fail to see also how much body is
	taken away, what is drawn away from a man’s very sinews and strength, by a speech which is drawn out uninteirupted from the rising gleam of dawn to the shades of black night, especially if it is poured forth with a great volume of sound. Therefore the voice must be bodily, since by much speaking a man loses a part of his body.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]542[/c]The roughness of voice, moreover, comes from
	roughness of the elements, as also smoothness from smoothness.

	in giving them form. When there is no long race for
	each of those utterances to run from start to finish, the words themselves also must necessarily be plainly heard and distinguished in all their joints and moulding; for the sound keeps its shaping and keeps its form. But if the intervening space is longer than it should be, the words passing through much air must necessarily be confused together and the voice blurred while it flies through the air. Therefore it follows that you can perceive a sound, and yet not distinguish what is the meaning of the words: so confused is the voice when it arrives and so hampered.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]563[/c]Besides, one word often awakens the ears of a whole crowd when uttered by the crier’s lips. Therefore one voice is dispersed suddenly into many voices,
	since it distributes itself amongst many separate ears, stamping on the words a shape and clear sound. But those of the voices which do not fall quite into the ears, are carried past and lost, being scattered abroad without effect into the air; some, dashed upon solid places and thrown back, give back a sound and at times delude with the image of a word.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]615[/c]Nor need one jot more of reasoning be added,
	or any more trouble, to explain the tongue and palate, by which we perceive flavours.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]617[/c]In the first place, we perceive flavour in the mouth while we squeeze it out in munching the food, as if one by chance takes in hand a sponge full of water and begins to press it dry. Then that which we squeeze out is distributed abroad through all the pores of the palate and the tortuous passages of the spongy tongue. Therefore, when the bodies of the
	oozing juice are smooth, sweetly they touch and sweetly stroke all the wet trickling regions around the tongue. But contrariwise they prick the sense and tear it as soon as they arise, in proportion as they are more full of roughness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]627[/c]Again, the pleasure that comes from flavour does not go beyond the palate; but when it has dropped down through the throat, there is no
	pleasure while it is all being distributed abroad through the frame. Nor does it matter at all with what food the body is nourished, so long as you can digest what you take, and distribute it abroad through the limbs, and keep the stomach in a constantly healthy condition.

	[c dimgray]633[/c]Next I will explain and enable us to see how
	different food is suited to different creatures, and why what is sour and bitter for some may yet seem very delicious to others. Indeed, there is so great a difference and distinction in these things that what is food to some creatures, is to others rank poison. Thus there is even a serpent, which when touched by man’s spittle perishes and gnaws itself to death.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Besides, hellebore is rank poison to us, but given to goats and quails makes them fat.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]642[/c]That you may know how this comes about, in
	the first place you must remember what I said before,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] that things contain many seeds mingled in various ways. Further, all creatures that take food, as they are different in outward appearance, and as the contour and circumscription of their shape limits and defines each according to its kind, so they are composed of seeds differing in shape. Since further
	the seeds differ, the intervals and channels, which we call passages, must also differ throughout the frame and so also in mouth and palate. Some therefore must be smaller and some larger, some triangular and some square, many round, some again with many angles in many arrangements. For as the relation of shapes and as the motions demand, so the shapes of the passages must differ, and so the channels must vary as the texture compels. Therefore if what is sweet to some is bitter to others, for the creature to whom it is sweet very smooth bodies

	must enter the pores of the palate with soothing touch; but contrariwise if the same thing is bitter to any when it gets in, doubtless rough and hooked elements penetrate the gullet.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]663[/c]It is easy now from these explanations to understand every separate case. For when fever arises in
	anyone, from overflow of bile, or when the energy of some disease is excited in another way, then the whole body is thrown into a riot and all the positions of the first-beginnings are changed about; it follows that the bodies which once were suitable to cause sensation, are so no longer, and the other things are more apt, which in penetrating can engender a bitter sensation; indeed both these are commingled in the savour of honey[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—a matter which I have explained to you often before.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]673[/c]Now listen and I will deal with the question,
	how the impact of odour affects the nose.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] First there must be a large number of things from which rolls flowing a manifold stream of odours, and we must think these flow and are sped and scattered everywhere; but different odours are more fitted to different creatures, because of their differing forms. And therefore bees are drawn through the air to any distance by the scent of honey, vultures by carrion. Then let loose a pack of hounds, it leads you on wherever the cloven hoof of wild beasts has set its step; and from afar the scent of man is caught by the white goose, preserver of the citadel of the

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]687[/c]Take all the smells then that assail the nostrils:
	one may be carried further than another, but yet no smell is ever carried so far as sound, as the voice, I need not add as all that strikes the sight of the eyes and assails the vision. For it wanders about and comes slowly, and is ready gradually to die away too soon,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] being dispersed abroad into the breezes of the air: first because it is emitted with
	difficulty from the depths of each thing; for since all things seem to smell stronger when broken, when ground up, when disintegrated in fire, this means that odour comes flowing released out of the depths of things; again it may be seen that smell is made
	of larger elements than voice, since it does not penetrate through stone walls,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] through which voice and sound commonly do pass. For this reason also you will see that it is not so easy to trace out in what part the scent is situated; for the blow grows cold in its leisurely course through the air, and does not run in hot to the sense with news of the object. This is why hounds often are at fault and cast for a scent.

	Scyllas,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and faces of dogs like Cerberus, and images
	of those for whom death is past, whose bones rest in earth’s embrace, since images of all kinds are being carried about everywhere, some that arise spontaneously in the air itself, some that are thrown off from all sorts of things, others that are made of a combination of these shapes. For certainly no image of a Centaur comes from one living, since there never
	was a living thing of this nature; but when the images of man and horse meet by accident, they easily adhere at once, as I said before,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] on account of their fine nature and thin texture. All other things of this class are made in the same way. And since these are carried about with velocity because of their extreme lightness, as I explained before,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] any given one of these fine images easily bestirs our mind by a single impression; for the mind is itself thin and wonderfully easy to move.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]749[/c]That this happens as I say, you may easily recognize
	from what is now to be said. Since this is like that—what we see with the mind like what we see with the eye—it must come about in a like way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]752[/c]Now therefore, since I have shown that I perceive a lion, it may be, by means of images which in such a case assail the eyes, we may be sure that the mind is moved in a like way, by means of the images of lions and of all else it sees, equally and no less than the eyes, except that it perceives what is more
	thin.

	as when we wake, and to such a degree, that we seem surely to see him who has left his life, and of whom now death and dust are masters. This nature compels to happen, for the reason that all our senses are obstructed and quiet throughout the frame, and unable to refute the false by the true.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Besides,
	in sleep memory lies inactive and is relaxed, and does not urge in contradiction that he has long since been in the power of death and destruction whom the mind believes itself to see alive.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]768[/c]Moreover, it is not wonderful that images move, and stir their arms rhythmically, and the rest of their limbs; for it does happen that the image seems to do this in our sleep; the truth is that, when the first
	image perishes and a second is then produced in another position, the former seems to have altered its pose. Of course this must be supposed to take place very swiftly: so great is their velocity, so great the store of things, so great the store of particles in any single moment of sensation, to enable the supply to come up.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]777[/c]There are many questions to be asked on this
	topic, many explanations to be given, if we wish to make the matter clear.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]779[/c]The first question is why the mind immediately
	thinks of whatever the whim takes it to think of. Do the images wait on our will, and as soon as we wish it does an image present itself to us, be it sea,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c][c dimgray]Cf.[/c] Diogenes of Oenoanda fr. 9. IV.7-VI.3 Smith: “When we are asleep, with all the senses as it were paralysed and extinguished \[again in\] sleep, the soul, which is \[still wide\] awake \[and yet is unable to recognize\] the predicament and condition of the senses at that time, on receiving the images that approach it, conceives an untested and false opinion concerning them, as if it were actually apprehending the solid nature of true realities; for the means of testing the opinion are asleep at that time. These are the senses; for the rule and standard \[of truth\] with respect to \[our dreams\] remain \[these\].”
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]A moment of sensation, as Lucr. explains below (794), is the shortest time in which one can feel or perceive. In this time many movements may combine to make one impression. Cinematographic pictures make this easy to understand.

	fails to attend, it is just as if the thing were all the while withdrawn and far removed from you. Then what wonder is it, if the mind misses everything except what it is itself intent on? Furthermore, we

	fitted upon sturdy upper arms, and ministering hands given on either side, only that we might be able to do what should be necessary for life.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Such explanations, and all other such that men give, put effect for cause and are based on perverted reasoning; since nothing is born in us simply in order that we may use it, but that which is born creates the use. There was no sight before the eyes with their
	light were born, no speaking of words before the tongue was made; but rather the origin of the tongue came long before speech, and the ear was made long before sound was heard, in a word all the members, as I think, existed before their use; they could not then have grown up for the sake of use.

	[c dimgray]843[/c]But contrariwise there was fighting hand to
	hand in the strife of battle, and tearing of limbs and polluting of bodies with blood, long before flashing shafts went flying; and nature taught men to avoid a wound before the left arm provided the interposition of a shield by artifice. You may be sure also that to yield the out-wearied body to rest is much more ancient than soft mattresses of a bed, and to quench the thirst is an older thing than drinking-cups. These things, therefore, which were found out from experience and life, may be well believed to have been invented for the sake of use. But those are all in a different class which were produced before any conception of their usefulness. Among the first of this class we see to be the senses and the limbs; therefore again and again I say, you have no reason at all to believe that they could have been made for the purpose of usefulness.

	[c dimgray]858[/c]Nor is there any reason to be surprised that
	the nature of each living body seeks its own food untaught. I have shown[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] you in fact that many bodies are thrown off flowing from things in many ways, but most must be thrown off from living creatures; for since these are always in quick movement, and many bodies are pressed out from their depths in sweat, many are exhaled through the mouth when they pant from exhaustion, by these means therefore the body becomes rarefied and its whole nature is undermined; and on this pain follows. For this reason food is taken, that it may prop up the frame and recreate the strength by filling the interstices, and may stop up the gaping desire to eat throughout limbs and veins.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Fluid also passes into all the different parts that demand fluid, and the bodies of
	heat gathered in large masses, which set our stomach in a blaze, are scattered abroad by the fluid as it comes and extinguished like flame, that the dry burning may no longer be able to scorch our frame. Thus then your panting thirst is swilled away out of the body, thus your starved craving is filled up.

	has first foreseen what it wills to do. (What it foresees, the image of that thing is present in the mind.) Therefore when the mind so bestirs itself that it wishes to go and to step forwards, at once it strikes all the mass of spirit that is distributed abroad
	through limbs and frame in all the body. And this is easy to do, since the spirit is held in close combination with it. The spirit in its tum strikes the body,
	and so the whole mass is gradually pushed on and moves. Besides, at that moment the body also expands its pores, and the air (as you might expect with something always so sensitive to movement)
	passes and penetrates through the opened passages in abundance, and so is distributed abroad into the very smallest parts of the body. Here then by two things[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] acting in two ways it comes about that the body is carried along, as a ship by sails and wind.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]898[/c]Again, there is no need to be surprised that elements so small can sway so large a body and tum about our whole weight. For indeed the wind, which
	is thin and has a fine substance, drives and pushes a great ship with mighty momentum, and one hand rules it however fast it may go, and one rudder steers it in any direction; and a machine by its blocks and treadwheels moves many bodies of great weight and uplifts them with small effort.

	[c dimgray]916[/c]In the first place sleep comes on when the power of spirit is drawn apart through the body, and
	part being cast forth has gone away, and part more crowded together has retreated into the depths; for only then the limbs loosen and become flaccid. For there is no doubt that this feeling in us comes about by action of the spirit, and when sleep hinders the feeling so that there is none, then we must suppose that the spirit has been disordered and cast forth without; but not all, for then the body would lie pervaded with the everlasting cold of death; since of course if no part of the spirit were left hidden in the limbs, like fire covered in a heap of ashes, whence
	could the feeling be suddenly rekindled throughout the limbs and arise like a flame from the hidden fire?

	[c dimgray]929[/c]But by what cause this new state comes to

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]932[/c]In the first place, it is necessary that since the
	body is touched by the breezes of the neighbouring air, the outer part of the body must be thumped and buffeted by the frequent blows of the air; and that is why nearly all things are protected by skin, or even shells, or a callosity or bark.

	drawn in and blown back. Therefore, since the body is beaten on both parts, and also blows coming in

	through the tiny passages penetrate to the primary particles and elements of our bodies, by degrees there comes about as it were a collapse all through the limbs.
	For the positions of the first-beginnings of both body and mind[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] are disordered. Next, part of
	the spirit comes to be cast forth, and a part recedes within and is hidden, a part again, being drawn
	abroad through the frame, cannot remain in conjunction or perform a combined motion; for nature shuts off the communications and paths; therefore sensation buries itself deep when the motions are changed. And since there is nothing as it were to prop up the limbs, the body becomes weak and all
	the members are languid, arms and eyelids fall, the hams often at the moment of lying down give way beneath you and lose their strength.

	[c dimgray]954[/c]Again, sleep follows after food, because food
	has exactly the same effect as the air, while it is being distributed abroad into the veins. And much the heaviest sleep is that which you take when replete or weary, because then the greatest number of elements are disordered, being dulled by long effort. Of the spirit, too, in the same way part is thrown together at a greater depth, and the quantity thrown forth is more ample, and it is more divided in itself and dispersed within.

	the confusion of their body. Again, one athirst often sits beside a stream or a pleasant spring, and all but swallows the whole river. Children often, when held fast in sleep, if they think they are lifting up their garments beside a basin or low pot, pour forth all the filtered liquid of their body, drenching the Babylonian coverlets in all their magnificence. Again those into the choppy tides[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of whose youth the seed is first penetrating, when time has duly produced it in the frame, meet with images from some chance body that fly abroad, bringing news of a lovely face and beautiful bloom, which excites and irritates the parts swelling with seed, so that, as if the whole business had been done, they often pour forth a great flood and stain their clothes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1037[/c]This seed, as I have said before, is stirred up
	within as soon as the age of full growth strengthens our frame. For there are different forces that move and excite different things; but only the power of man can draw forth human seed from a man. As soon as the seed comes forth, driven from its retreats, it is withdrawn from the whole body through all the limbs and members, gathering in fixed parts in the loins, and arouses at once the body’s genital parts themselves. Those parts thus excited swell with the seed, and there arises a desire to emit it towards that whither the dire craving tends; and the body seeks that which has wounded the mind with love.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	For all generally fall towards a wound, and the blood jets out in the direction of the blow that has struck us, and if he is close by, the ruddy flood drenches the enemy. So therefore, if one is wounded by the shafts of Venus, whether it be a boy with girlish limbs who launches the shaft at him, or a woman radiating love from her whole body, he tends to the source of the blow, and desires to unite and to cast the fluid[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] from body to body; for his dumb desire presages delight.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1058[/c]This is our Venus; from this also comes love’s
	name[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; from this first trickled into the heart that dewdrop of Venus’s sweetness, and then came up freezing care. For if what you love is absent, yet its images are there, and the sweet name sounds in your ears. But it is fitting to flee from images, to scare away what feeds love, to turn the mind in other directions, to cast the collected liquid into any body, and not to retain it, being wrapped up once for all in the love of one, nor to cherish care and certain pain for yourself. For the sore quickens and becomes inveterate by feeding, daily the madness takes on and the tribulation grows heavier, if you do not confuse the first wounds by new blows, and cure them in time while fresh by wandering with Venus light-o’-love, or tum your thoughts in some other direction.

	[c dimgray]1073[/c]Nor does he who avoids love lack the fruit of
	Venus, but rather he takes the advantages which are without penalty; for certainly a pleasure more unmixed comes from this to the healthy than to the lovesick. Indeed, in the very time of possession, lovers’ ardour is storm-tossed, uncertain in its course, hesitating what first to enjoy with eye or hand. They press closely the desired object, hurting the body, often they set their teeth in the lips and crush mouth on mouth, because the pleasure is not unmixed and there are secret stings which urge them to hurt that very thing, whatever it may be, from which those germs of frenzy grow.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1084[/c]But Venus gives a light break to the suffering amidst their love, and the soothing pleasure intermingled curbs back the bites. For here lies the hope
	that the fire may be extinguished from the same body that was the origin of the burning, which nature contrariwise denies out and out to be possible; and this is the only thing, for which the more we have, the more fierce burns the heart with fell craving. For food and liquid are absorbed into the body, and since these can possess certain fixed parts, thereby the desire of water or bread is easily fulfilled. But from man’s aspect and beautiful bloom nothing comes into the body to be enjoyed except thin images; and this poor hope is often snatched away by the wind. As when in dreams a thirsty man seeks to drink, and no water is forthcoming to quench the burning in his frame, but he seeks the image of water, striving in vain, and in the midst of a rushing river thirsts while he drinks: so in love Venus mocks
	lovers with images, nor can bodies even in real presence satisfy lovers with looking, nor can they

Lastly, when clasped body to body they enjoy the flower of their age, at the moment when the body foretastes its joy and Venus is on the point of sowing the woman’s field,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] they cling greedily close together and join their watering mouths and draw deep breaths pressing teeth on lips; but all is vanity, for they can rub nothing off, nor can they penetrate and be absorbed body in body; for this they seem sometimes to wish and to strive for: so eagerly do they cling in the couplings of Venus, while their limbs slacken and melt under the power of delight. At length when the gathered desire has burst from their loins, there is a short pause for a while in the furious burning. Then the same frenzy returns, and once more the

A swollen thing with large breasts is Ceres herself after the birth of lacchus, the pug-nosed is Silena or Madame Satyr, the thick-lipped is “all kiss.” It would be a long task if I were to try to go through all the list.

	poor wretch, with rank odours while her maidservants give her a wide berth and giggle behind her back. But the lover shut out, weeping, often covers the threshold with flowers and wreaths, anoints the proud doorposts with oil of marjoram, presses his love-sick kisses upon the door; but if he is let in, once he gets but one whiff as he comes, he would seek some decent excuse for taking his leave; there would be an end of the complaint so often rehearsed, so deeply felt, and he would condemn himself on the spot of folly, now he sees that he has attributed to her more than it is right to concede to a mortal. Our Venuses are quite well aware of this; so they
	are at greater pains themselves to hide all that is behind the scenes of life from those whom they wish to detain fast bound in the chains of love; but all is vanity, since you can nevertheless in your minds drag it all into the light of day, and seek the cause of all the merriment,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and if she is nice-minded and not a nuisance, you can overlook in your tum and make some concession to human weakness.

	[c dimgray]1192[/c]Nor does a woman always feign the passion
	which makes her sigh, when she embraces her mate joining body to body, and holds his lips in a long kiss, moistening them with her own. For she often does it from the heart, and seeking mutual joys rouses him to run the full course in the lists of love. Nor otherwise could birds or cattle, wild beasts or sheep or mares submit to the male, were it not that their own nature, overflowing, is on heat and burning, and they thrust gladly against the penis of the mounting male. Do you not see also, when mutual pleasure has enchained a pair, how they are often tormented

	in their common chains? For often dogs at the cross-ways, desiring to part, pull hard in different directions with all their strength, when all the while they are held fast in the strong couplings of Venus. But this they would never do, unless they both felt these joys which were enough to lure them into the trap and to hold them enchained. Therefore again and again I say, the pleasure is for both.

	[c dimgray]1209[/c]And in the mingling of seed, when by any

But those whom you see with the shape of each, mingling the marks of their parents’ countenances together, grow from the father’s body and the mother’s blood both, when the seeds stirred up through the frame by the goads of Venus have been thrust together by the passion of two breathing as one, neither conquering, neither conquered.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1218[/c]It sometimes happens also that the children may appear like a grandfather and often reproduce the looks of a great-grandfather, because the parents often conceal in their bodies many first-beginnings mingled in many ways, which fathers hand on to fathers received from their stock; from these Venus brings forth forms with varying lot, and reproduces the countenance, the voice, the hair of their ancestors; for these features come from a fixed seed no less than our faces and bodies and limbs.

It is all vanity that they weary the gods’ power and magic lots; for they are barren, some because
	too thick, others in turn because it is too watery and thin. The thin, because it cannot stick and adhere to the parts, at once flows away and departs withdrawn in untimely birth. That which is too thick, again, since it is emitted too closely clotted, either does not leap forward with so far-reaching a blow, or cannot equally well penetrate the part, or, although it penetrate, does not easily mix with the woman’s seed. For sexual harmony is seen to vary greatly. Some men more easily impregnate some women than others, some women more easily receive
	their burden from some than from others and become pregnant. Many women barren often enough in earlier wedlock, yet have found those from whom they could conceive children and be enriched with sweet offspring; and often men, in whose homes hitherto women though fruitful have been unable to bear a child, yet have found a natural mate, so that

	they could protect their old age with children. So important is it that the seeds should be able to be commingled together in a manner suited for generation, and that the thick should be combined with the watery and the watery with the thick.
	And in this regard it is of importance with what food the life is nourished; for some foods make the seed thicken in the body, and others again make it thin and wasting.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1263[/c]Another thing of very great importance is the position in which the soothing pleasure itself is taken; for wives are thought generally to conceive better after the manner of wild beasts and quadrupeds, because in that position, breast down and loins up, the seeds can occupy the proper places. Lascivious
	movements are of no use whatever to wives. For a woman forbids herself to conceive and fights against it, if in her delight she thrusts against the man’s penis with her buttocks,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] making undulating movements[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] with all her body limp; for she turns the share clean away from the furrow and makes the seed fail of its place.

	the frame of which the world consists is subject to death and has also had birth; in what ways that assemblage of matter established earth, sky, sea, and stars, the sun and the ball of the moon; then
	explaining what animals arose from the earth, and what have never been born at any time; and in what manner the human race began to use variety or speech in their intercourse by means of the names of things; and in what ways that fear of gods crept into the heart, which in our earth keeps holy their shrines and pools and groves, their altars and images. Besides, I will explain by what force pilot nature steers the courses of the sun and the goings of the moon; lest by any chance we think that these between heaven and earth traverse their yearly courses free, of their own will, and obliging for the increase of crops and of animals, or deem them to revolve by some plan of the gods. For if those who have been rightly taught that the gods lead a life without care, yet wonder all the while how things can go on, especially those transactions which are perceived overhead in the regions of ether, they revert back again to the old superstitions, and take to themselves cruel taskmasters, whom the poor wretches believe to be almighty, not knowing what can be and what cannot, in a word how each thing has limited power and a deep-set boundary mark.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	would quench the shining light of the sun in heaven, tarnishing things immortal with mortal speech; although these things are so far distant from the power of divinity and unworthy to be found in the
	number of the gods, that they should rather be thought to show forth in themselves what that is, which has neither lively motion nor feeling.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]126[/c]For in fact it is not possible that the mind and
	understanding can be thought able to reside in any and every body; just as in the upper air there can be no tree, no clouds in the salt sea, as fish cannot live on the fields, blood cannot be in wood, nor sap in stones.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] It is fixed and ordained where each thing can grow and abide. So the mind cannot arise alone
	and apart without a body, nor can it be far distant from sinews and blood. But if it could do this, the force of the mind itself could much more easily be in head or shoulders or down in the heels, and be born in any part, and at least abide in the same man, the same vessel.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] But since even in our own body there is seen to be a fixed rule and ordinance in what place spirit and mind can be and grow apart, so much the more must we deny that it can abide wholly outside the body and the animal structure in crumbling clods of
	earth or the sun’s fire or in water or the lofty regions of air. Therefore these are not endowed with divine feeling, since they cannot be animated with life.

	[c dimgray]200[/c]In the first place, of all that the sky covers with its mighty expanse, a greedy part is possessed by mountains and forests full of wild beasts, part rocks and vasty marshes hold, and the sea that keeps the shores of lands far apart. Almost two parts of
	these lands are robbed from mortals by scorching heat, and constantly falling frost. Even the land that is left, nature would still cover with brambles by her own power, but that man’s power resists, well accustomed to groan over the stout mattock for very life, and to cleave the soil with the pressure of the plough. If by turning over the fruitful clods with the ploughshare and trenching the soil we do not bring them to birth,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] no growths could emerge into the lambent air of their own accord; and even so at times, these procured by great labour, when they are already covering the earth with leafage and are all in bloom, are either scorched up by the sun in heaven with too great heat, or cut off by sudden rains and chilly frost, and the blasts of wind batter them with violent storms.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]235[/c]In the first place,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] since the earth’s mass and
	the water, the wind’s light breezes, and burning heat, which are seen to compose this sum of things, all consist of a body that is born and dies, we must consider the whole world to be of the same structure. For certainly whenever we see the parts and the members of creatures to be made of body that has birth and forms that are subject to death, we perceive these same creatures to be invariably subject to death and birth along with the parts. Therefore, when I see the grand parts and members of the world being consumed and born again, I may be sure that heaven and earth also once had their time of beginning and will have their destruction.

	subject to death, when I did not hesitate to say that
	water and air perish and are born again and increase once more, in the first place a large part of the earth, scorched with incessant suns and trampled by a host of feet, exhales a cloud of dust and flying mists which the strong winds disperse abroad through the whole sky. A part of the soil again is washed away by rain, and the scraping rivers nibble at their banks. Besides, whatever the earth nourishes and increases is given back in its due proportion[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; and since beyond all doubt the mother of all is seen also to be the universal sepulchre, therefore you see that the earth is diminished and is increased and grows again.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]261[/c]Moreover, there is no need to say how sea,
	rivers, and springs for ever well up in abundance with fresh waters and their streams flow unceasing: the great pouring down of waters from all sides makes it clear. But, bit by bit, whatever comes first of the water is taken off, and the result is that there is no superabundance of liquid in the sum total; partly because strong winds sweep the surface and diminish it, as does the sun on high unravelling it with his rays[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; partly because it is distributed abroad through all the earth underneath; for the pungency is strained off, and the substance of the water oozes back, and all meets at the sources of each river,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]whence it returns over the earth in a column of sweet water along the path which has once been cut for it in its liquid course.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

This you may recognize from what follows. As soon as clouds begin first to come up under the sun, and as it were to break in between[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] the rays of light, at once the lower part of these rays is all lost, and the earth is in shadow wherever the clouds go; that you may see that things need light ever new, that one by one each cast of light is lost, that things cannot be seen in the sun in any other way unless the very source of light should bring up an unceasing supply. Again, you see, by night the
	lights that are on the earth, hanging lamps, and torches bright with flickering flashes and all fat with thick black smoke, fostered by the fire in like manner, make haste to bring up new supplies of brightness: with trembling flames on they go, on they go, and the light never seems to be broken in between or leaves the place, so swift is it to hide its extinction by the quick birth of flame from all those fires.

	things beyond The ban War[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and the ruin of Troy? Into Avhat place have so many deeds of men so often fallen, and nowhere flower implanted[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] in eternal monuments of fame? But, as I think, the world is young and new, and it is not long since its beginning. Therefore even now some arts are being
	perfected, some also are in growth; to-day many improvements have been made in ships, yesterday musicians invented their musical tunes; again this nature and system of the world has been discovered but lately, and I myself am now found the very first to be able to describe it in our own mother tongue.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]338[/c]But if by any chance you believe that all these
	things have been the same before, but that the generations of men have perished in scorching heat, or that their cities have been cast down by some great upheaval of the world, or that after incessant rains rivers have issued out to sweep over the earth and overwhelm their towns, so much the more you must own yourself worsted, and agree that destruction will come to earth and sky. For when things were assailed by so great afflictions and so great dangers, if then a more serious cause had come upon them, there would have been widespread destruction and a mighty fall. And in no other way are we seen to be mortal than that we see one another fall sick of the same diseases as those whom nature has taken away from life.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]A lost epic poem, the [c dimgray]Thebaïs,[/c] told the story of the Seven against Thebes: how the Argive king Adrastus, Polyneices, the exiled son of Oedipus, and five others led an army against Thebes in an unsuccessful attempt to restore Polyneices to the throne.

	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]It is usually thought that C. Amafinius, whom Cicero ([c dimgray]Tusc.

Howe, [c dimgray]AJPhil. 62[/c] (1957) 57-62, has followed G. Delia Valle in maintaining that Amafinius and Lucr. were contemporaries, his arguments, though important, are not entirely convincing. But if indeed Amafinius had written earlier than Lucr., why does Lucr. ignore him? The answer may be that Amafinius’ works were brief and dealt mainly with ethical doctrine, and that Lucr. was the first Latin writer to give a detailed account of Epicurean physics.

	this world is not made of solid body, since there is void intermingled in things; nor yet is it like the these, void; nor again are bodies lacking that can by chance gather out of the infinite, and overwhelm this sum of things in a violent hurricane or bring in any other disaster and danger; nor further is place lacking and profundity of space into which the walls of the world can be scattered out; or they may be struck by any other force and perish.

	war,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] do you not see that some end may be given to their long strife? Either when sun and all heat shall prevail, having drunk up all the waters; which they are striving to do, but so far they are unable to accomplish the attempt: so plentiful a supply do the rivers bring up, and further threaten to deluge the whole from the deep gulf of the sea—all in vain, since the winds sweeping the surface of the waters diminish them, as does the ethereal sun unravelling them by his rays, and these are confident that they can dry up all before the water can attain the end of its endeavour. So fierce is their warlike spirit, as in well-matched contest they strive to win a decision upon a mighty cause; although in the meanwhile fire won the mastery once, and once, as the story goes, water was king over the fields.

	[c dimgray]396[/c]For fire prevailed and went round burning up

	first fiery ether uplifted itself and lightly drew with it quantities of fire; in no very different way than we often see, when in the morning the golden light of the beaming sun first blushes over herbage jewelled with dew,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] when the lakes and the ever-flowing streams exhale a mist, and the very earth seems sometimes to smoke; then when all these exhalations come together on high above us, clouds with body now cohering weave a texture under the sky. In this way therefore at that time the light and expansive
	ether, with coherent body, bent around on all sides and expanded widely on all sides in every direction, thus fenced in all the rest with greedy embrace.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]471[/c]This was followed by the beginnings of sun and
	moon, whose globes revolve in the air between the two; which neither earth nor the great ether adopted to itself, because they were neither so heavy as to sink down and settle, nor so light that they could glide through the uppermost regions, and yet they remain between both in such fashion that they revolve like living bodies and abide as parts of the whole world; in the same way as in us some members may remain at rest, while yet there are others moving.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]480[/c]Therefore when these bodies were withdrawn,
	suddenly the earth sank down where now the blue expanse of the sea extends so wide, and drowned its hollows with the salt flood. And day by day, the more the tide of ether and the sun’s rays compressed the earth into compactness with frequent blows from
	all sides upon its outermost confines, so that thus beaten it was packed together and came together upon its own centre,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] so much the more did the salt

	sweat, squeezed out of its body, by its oozing increase the sea and the swimming plains, and so much the more slipped out and flew away those many bodies of heat and air, and on high far from the earth packed the shining regions of the sky. The plains settled down, the lofty mountains increased their height; for the rocks could not sink, nor could all parts subside equally to the same degree.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]495[/c]In this way, therefore, the heavy earth became
	solid with compact body, and all the mud of creation, so to speak, flowed together by its weight and settled to the bottom like dregs; then sea, then air, then the fiery ether itself, being made of fluid particles, were all left pure, some lighter than others, and ether, lightest and most fluid, floats above the airy breezes, and does not mingle its fluid consistency with the stormy breezes of air: it leaves all things below to be turned upside down by violent tempests, leaves them to be disturbed with wayward storms, while itself bearing its own fires it glides with unchanging sweep. For that the ether may flow gently along with one sole movement is proved by the Pontus, a sea which flows with unchanging current and keeps ever one course of gliding movement.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	of the world, it is proper that the weight should
	vanish away by degrees and grow less, and that it should have another substance beneath, joined together with it from the beginning of its life and united into one with the airy parts of the world on which it is engrafted and lives. This is why it is no burden and does not depress the air; just as to a
	man his limbs are no burden, the head no burden to the neck, nor in a word do we feel the whole weight of the body to be pressing upon the feet; but all weights that come from without and are placed upon us annoy, although often very much smaller. So important is it what each thing can do. In this way then the earth is not something alien suddenly brought and thrown upon alien airs from some other quarter, but it was conceived along with them from the first beginning of the world and a fixed part of it, as in us the limbs are seen to be.

	[c dimgray]550[/c]Besides, the earth shaken suddenly with a

	[c dimgray]564[/c]The wheel of the sun and its heat cannot be
	much greater or less than is perceived by our senses.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For from whatever distances fires can project light and breathe warm heat upon our bodies, they diminish nothing by these intervals from their mass of flame, and the fire is made no narrower to the eye. Therefore, since the sun’s heat and flooding light reach to our senses and the world shines[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] with its rays, the shape also of the sun and its size must so truly be seen from the earth that you can add nothing at all to it and take nothing away.

For all things that we see at a great distance through much air become dimmed in appearance before their size is diminished. Therefore the moon,  since it offers a clear appearance and a firm outline, must be seen on high by us from the earth in exactly the shape that defines it and of the size it really is.

	[c dimgray]592[/c]Another thing also need not excite wonder,
	how it can be that so small a sun emits so much light, enough to fill with its flood seas and all lands and the heavens, and to suffuse all with warm heat. For it is possible that from this place is opened one single
	fountain of the whole world, to splash its generous flood and to fling forth light, because the elements of heat gather together from all parts of the world in such a manner, and their assemblage flows together in such a manner, that the heat flows out here from one single source.

	[c dimgray]610[/c]Perhaps also the sun, as he shines on high with

	how the moon is seen to traverse month by month the space which the sun’s course takes a year to travel. No single reason, I say, is given for these things.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]621[/c]For[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] among the most likely causes is that
	which the venerable judgement of that great man Democritus puts forward[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]: that the nearer the different heavenly bodies are to the earth, the less can they be carried along with the whirling sky, since the swiftness of force in that movement vanishes away and its power grows less in the lower regions, and so the sun is gradually left behind with the signs that are behind him, because he is much lower than the burning signs[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] And the moon, he says, still more than this: in proportion as her course is still lower, farther from the sky and nearer the earth, so much the less can she keep up with the
	signs; and in proportion as she is carried with fainter whirling movement, being lower than the sun, so much the sooner do the signs catch her up all around and pass by. That is why she seems to move back to each sign more quickly, because it is the signs that more quickly return to her.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]637[/c]It is possible also that from parts of the world
	across the sun’s path two airs may flow alternately each at its own fixed time, one strong enough to push him away from the summer signs as far as the midwinter solstice and the stiffening cold, one to throw him back from the icy shades of cold as far as the regions full of heat and the burning signs. And in like manner we must suppose that the moon, and the
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]621-649 is a passage of considerable difficulty. The reader who finds Lucr.’s explanations hard to follow may derive comfort from the thought that the poet does not seem to have fully understood them himself! For a helpful discussion, illustrated with two figures, see Bailey.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]622=3.371.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]From Lucr.’s point of view, in which the earth is the fixed centre, the sun and the signs of the zodiac are moving in the same direction, but the sun more slowly than the signs because nearer the earth. Hence the signs catch him up one by one, and he appears to move through the signs in the opposite direction.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]650[/c]But night buries the earth in vasty blackness,
	either when the sun after his long course has struck upon the extremity of the sky and breathed out his fires in weariness, shaken by the journey and made weak by passing through so much air; or because he is compelled to turn round his course beneath the earth by the same force which carried his orb above the earth.

	[c dimgray]656[/c]At a fixed time also Matuta[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] diffuses the rosy
	dawn through the regions of ether and spreads out her light, either because the same sun returning under the earth takes his first hold on the sky as he tries to kindle it with his rays, or because there is a gathering together of fires, and many seeds of heat are accustomed to flow together at a fixed time, which make each day the light of a new sun arise: just as it is said that from the lofty mountains of Ida[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] at sunrise scattered fires are seen, and then as it were these gather together into one globe and together form an orb.

	a fixed time shed their flowers. No less at a fixed time our age commands the teeth to fall out, and bids the ungrown youth to put on the soft vestures of growth and to let his beard grow equally down either cheek. Lastly lightnings, snow, rain, clouds, and winds come at fairly fixed seasons of the year. For since the first-beginnings of causes have been

For in the mid-course of the blast of the north wind and of the south wind[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] the heaven holds his turning-points apart equally distant on account of the position of the whole zodiac, in which the sun, creeping along, consumes the period of a year, as he casts his light

The moon, when furthest from the sun, is perceived by us as at the full, the earth being between sun and moon (but not in the same straight line). As it approaches the sun, we see less and less of its light; when it is opposite to us, the lines from the earth to sun and moon forming a right angle, it is half full; when nearest to the sun, the lines forming an obtuse angle, we see nothing. When all three are in one straight line, there is an eclipse either of sun or of moon.

	meadows shone with the colour of green; then to the various kinds of trees came a mighty struggle, as they raced at full speed to grow up into the air. As feathers and hair and bristles first grow on the frame of four-footed creatures or the body of strong-winged birds, so then the new-born earth put forth herbage and saplings first, and in the next place
	created the generations of mortal creatures, arising in many kinds and in many ways by different processes. For animals cannot have fallen from the sky, nor can creatures of the land have come out of the salt pools.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]795[/c]It remains,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] therefore, that the earth deserves

First the race of winged things and the different birds issued from their eggs being hatched in the springtime, just as now in summer the cicadas of their own accord leave their neat husks, to seek life and living. The earth, you see, first gave forth the generations of mortal creatures at that time,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] for there was great abundance of heat and moisture in the fields.

	he air, nature would direct thither pores of the earth and make it discharge from these open veins a liquid like to milk, just as now when a woman has brought forth she is filled with sweet milk, because all that rush of nourishment is directed towards the breasts. Earth gave food for the children, warmth gave the raiment, the herbage, a bed with abundance of down rich and soft. But the infancy of the world produced neither hard cold nor excessive heat nor winds of great force; for all things grow and gain strength together.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]821[/c]Therefore again and again the earth deserves

	bearing, she ceased, like a woman worn out by old age. For time changes the nature of the whole
	world, and one state of things must pass into another, and nothing remains as it was: all things move, all are changed by nature and compelled to alter. For one thing crumbles and grows faint and weak with age, another grows up and comes forth from contempt. So therefore time changes the nature of the whole world, and one state of the earth gives place to another, so that what she bore she cannot, but can bear what she did not bear before.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	then tried to make, springing up with wondrous appearance and frame: the hermaphrodite, between man and woman yet neither, different from both; some without feet, others again bereft of hands; some found dumb also without a mouth, some blind without eyes, some bound fast with all their limbs adhering to their bodies, so that they could do nothing and go nowhere, could neither avoid mischief nor take what they might need. So with the rest of like monsters and portents that she made, it was all in vain; since nature banned their growth, and they could not attain the desired flower of age nor find food nor join by the ways of Venus. For we see
	that living beings need many things in conjunction, so that they may be able by procreation to forge out the chain of the generations: first there must be food, next there must be a way for the life-giving seeds throughout the frame to flow out from the slackened body; and that male and female be joined, they must both have the means to exchange mutual pleasures.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

But the intelligent dog, so light of sleep and so true of heart, and all the various kinds which are sprung from the seed of beasts of burden, woolly sheep also, and horned breeds of oxen, all these have been entrusted to men’s protection, Memmius. For these have eagerly fled from the wild beasts, they have sought peace and the generous provision gained by no labour of theirs, which we give them as the reward of their usefulness.

	[c dimgray]871[/c]But those to which nature gave no such qualities, so that they could neither live by themselves at their own will, nor give us some usefulness for which we might suffer them to feed under our protection and be safe, these certainly lay at the mercy of others for prey and profit, being all hampered by their own fateful chains, until nature brought that race to destruction.

	time of the flower of boyhood, when youth is beginning and is clothing the cheeks with soft down. I say this that you may not believe that Centaurs can be formed or be, composed of man and the seed of the burden-bearing horse, or that a Scylla can exist with body half fish and a girdle of ravening dogs, and all other such monsters in which we see the members to be incompatible, which are not in their prime together, nor come to their bodily strength together, nor lose strength in old age, nor burn with passion alike, nor agree in habits, nor find the same

	poured forth the animals, that is nevertheless no proof that creatures of mixed growth could be made, and limbs of various creatures joined into one; because the various kinds of plants and the corn and the luxuriant trees, which even now spring in abundance from the earth, nevertheless cannot be produced interwoven together, but each thing proceeds after its own fashion, and all by fixed law of nature preserve their distinctions.

Through many lustres of the sun rolling through the sky they passed their lives after the wide-wandering fashion of wild beasts. No
	sturdy guider of the curved plough was there, none knew how to work the fields with iron, to dig new shoots into the ground, to prune off old branches from the tall trees with a sickle. What sun and rain had given, what the earth had produced of her own accord, that was a gift enough to content their minds. Amidst the acorn-laden oaks they refreshed themselves

	[c dimgray]970[/c]And when night overtook them, like bristly hogs they just cast their savage bodies naked upon

For since they had been accustomed from childhood always to see darkness and light return in alternate sequence, it was impossible that they should ever feel wonder, or fear lest everlasting night should possess the world, the sun’s light being withdrawn for ever. Rather what troubled them was that the tribes of beasts
	often made their rest dangerous to the poor wretches: driven from their home, they would flee from their rocky shelters when a foaming boar appeared or a mighty lion, and at dead of night in terror would yield their leaf-strewn beds to the savage guests.

	else the race of mankind would have been even then wholly destroyed, nor would birth and begetting have been able to prolong their posterity to the present day.

	[c dimgray]1028[/c]But the various sounds of the tongue nature
	drove them to utter,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and convenience moulded the names for things, not far otherwise than very speech-lessness is seen to drive children to the use of gesture, when it makes them point with the finger at things that are before them. For each feels to what purpose he is able to use his own powers.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Before the budding horns stand out on the calf’s forehead, these are what he uses in anger to butt with and pushes viciously; then panthers’ kittens and lions’ cubs already fight with claws and feet and bite, even when teeth and claws are as yet scarcely grown. Further, we see that all the winged tribes trust to their wings and seek unsteady aid from their pinions.

	[c dimgray]1041[/c]Therefore to suppose that someone then distributed
	names amongst things, and that from him men learnt their first words, is folly. For why should he have been able to mark all things with titles and to utter the various sounds of the tongue, and at the same time others not be thought able to have done

Besides, if others had not also used these terms in their intercourse, whence was that foreknowledge[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of usefulness implanted in him, and whence did he first gain such power, as to know what he wanted to do and to see it in his mind’s eye? Compel them again he could not, one against many, nor could he master and conquer them, that they should wish to learn the names of things; nor is it easy to teach in any way or to persuade what is necessary to be done, when men are deaf; for they would not have suffered or endured in any way that he should go on dinning into their ears sounds of the voice which they had never heard, all to no purpose.

	[c dimgray]1073[/c]Again, is there not seen to be a difference also
	in the neighing, when amidst the mares a young stallion in the flower of his age runs wild, struck with the, spurs of winged Love, and snorts out from wide nostrils for the fight,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and when, as it chances, on some other occasion lie neighs with shaking limbs?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1078[/c]Lastly, the race of winged creatures and
	different birds, hawks and ospreys, and divers, which seek life and living on the salt water amidst the waves of the sea, utter at other times sounds which differ greatly from those which they utter when they are fighting for food and their prey is offering resistance.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Some birds change their harsh-toned song with the weather, such as the generations of ancient crows or flocks of rooks, when they are said to call for water and rain, or sometimes to cry for wind and breeze.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1087[/c]Therefore if different feelings compel animals, dumb though they are, to utter different sounds, how much more natural it is that mortal men should then have been able to mark different things with one sound or another!

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]“quaenam arma? Martiane, an Venerea?” asks Lambinus. That the battle is between the stallion and the mares is proved by Virgil’s imitation in [c dimgray]G.[/c] 3.83-85: [c dimgray]tum, si qua sonum procul anna dedere, | stare loco nescit, micat auribus et tremit artus, | collectumque fremens volvit sub naribus ignem.

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]C. L. Howard, [c dimgray]CPhil. 56[/c] (1961) 158, rightly follows A. Cartault in taking [c dimgray]praedae[/c] as nom. plural. It must be the prey that fights back, as in Petronius 109.6: [c dimgray]alms hamis blandientibus convellebat praedam repugnantem.[/c] The plural [c dimgray]praedae[/c] (for which [c dimgray]cf. e.g.[/c] Juvenal 11.101) is natural here, for, as Howard says, it is a question of the various preys of various birds.

	we can see many things catch fire implanted with the flames from on high, when the stroke from heaven has given them its heat. And yet also when a branching tree struck by the winds, swaying and
	tossed about, leans on the branches of a tree, fire is pressed out by the great force of the friction, at times the burning glare of flame flashes out while branches and trunks are rubbed together.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Either of these causes may have given fire to mankind.

	soften it by the heat of names, since they saw many things grow mellow, vanquished by the blows of the heat of his rays amid the fields.

	[c dimgray]1105[/c]More and more daily they were shown how to

	build a citadel for their own protection and refuge; and they divided cattle and lands, and gave them to each according to beauty and strength and genius; for beauty had great power, and strength had importance, in those days. Afterwards wealth was introduced and gold was discovered, which easily

	men desired to be famous and powerful, that their

	purpose, and to sweat blood in struggling along the narrow path of ambition; since their wisdom comes from the lips of others, and they pursue things on hearsay rather than from their own feelings.

So things came to the uttermost dregs of confusion, when each man for himself sought dominion and exaltation. Then there were some
	who taught them to create magistrates, and established law, that they might be willing to obey statutes. For mankind, tired of living in violence, was fainting from its feuds, and so they were readier

	of their own will to submit to statutes and strict
	rules of law. For because each man in his wrath would make ready to avenge himself more severely than is permitted now by just laws, for this reason men were utterly weary of living in violence.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1151[/c]Hence comes fear of punishment that taints
	the prizes of life; for violence and injury enclose in their net all that do such things, and generally return upon him who began, nor is it easy to pass a quiet and peaceful life for him whose deeds violate the bonds of the common peace. For even if he hide it from gods and men, he must yet be uncertain that it will for ever remain hidden[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; seeing that often many men, speaking in dreams or raving in delirium, are said to have discovered themselves, and to have disclosed deeply hidden matters and their sins.

	what cause has spread the divinity of the gods over great nations and filled the cities with altars, and has made customary rites to be undertaken, rites which now flourish in great states and places, from which even now remains implanted in mortal men the awe that raises new shrines to the gods all over the world, and drives them to throng together on festal days.

	these congealed together and gleaming upon the earth with bright colour, they would pick them up captivated by the sleek smooth grace and would see that they were each moulded into a shape like the
	hollows in which they had left their mark. Then it dawned upon them that these metals might be melted and run into any shape and form of objects,
	and might furthermore be beaten out with blows into the sharpest and finest possible point or edge, to make themselves tools, to cut down trees, to rough-hew timber and to plane planks smooth, to bore also and to pierce and perforate. And they would try to make these at first no less of silver and gold than of bronze[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] with its tough and strong substance, but in vain, since the strength of these yielded and bent, nor could they so well bear the hard work. Then bronze was of more worth, and gold was thought
	little of, being useless with its edge blunted and dull. Now bronze is thought little of, and gold has mounted to the chief honour. So rolling time changes the seasons of things. What was of worth comes at

With bronze men tilled the soil of the earth, with bronze they stirred up the waves of war, and sowed[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] devastating, wounds, and seized cattle and lands; for when some were armed, all that was naked and unarmed readily gave way to them.

	Some let slip strong lions before them, with armed trainers and harsh masters to control them and to hold them in leash; but in vain, since when heated with the promiscuous slaughter they ran wild, and
	threw the squadrons into confusion, friend and foe alike, on all sides shaking the frightful crests[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] upon their heads, nor could the riders soothe the spirits of their horses terrified at the roaring, nor guide them towards the foe with the curb. The she-lions enraged bounded this way and that, and leapt straight for the faces of those that met them, or tore at others unawares from behind, and clasping them close bore them to the ground helpless from the wound, holding fast to them with strong jaws and curving claws. The bulls tossed their own friends and trampled them underfoot, and laid bare flanks and bellies of horses, striking from below with their horns, and scored up the earth with threatening in­tent.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Bailey, who says that he is “unaware of any parallel account of the actions of primitive man, except in Diodorus Siculus 1.48.1,” finds 1308-1349 “fantastic ” and as possibly indicative of madness. But he and other commentators are mistaken in thinking that Lucr. is writing of primitive times, as is shown by the mention of [c dimgray]vinclis[/c] (1312) and [c dimgray]tela[/c] (1327). The [c dimgray]arma antiqua[/c] were hands, nails, teeth, stones, branches, and fire (1283-1285); the discovery of metals came later. On the other hand, 1339 implies that the experiments with bulls, boars, and lions are supposed to have occurred before the introduction of elephants. As for the allegation that the passage is “fantastic,” even if there were no authority for stories of such experiments, Lucr., in accordance with the Epicurean belief that developments are made gradually by a process of trial and error, might reasonably have thought it unlikely that men immediately made successful experiments with one wild animal, the elephant, and did not try other fierce beasts ([c dimgray]cf.[/c] 1269-1272, on experiments with metals). However, there is no need to suppose that the whole story is a flight of the poet’s imagination: [c dimgray]cf. S.H.A., Antoninus[/c] [c dimgray]Caracalia[/c] 6.4: [c dimgray]dehinc per Cadusios et Babylonios ingressus tumultuarie cum Parthorum satrapis manum contulit, feris etiam bestiis in hostes inmissis.[/c] The passage could perhaps be regarded as unnecessarily long and detailed, if Lucr. were interested merely in giving a straightforward account of an experimental stage in the development of military techniques. But surely he is, as so often in this last section of Book 5, also making a moral point: whereas primitive men (see 982-993) ran away [c dimgray]spumigeri suis adventu validique leonis[/c] (985) and occasionally an individual became the victim of a wild beast, in more recent times men deliberately instigated these animals to kill wholesale. The suggestion that his account was partly inspired by contemporary [c dimgray]venationes[/c] (see K. L. McKay, [c dimgray]AJPhil.[/c] 85 \[1964\] 125-126) is highly probable. See also S. R. West, [c dimgray]Philol.[/c] 119 (1975) 150-151.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]By “crests ” Lucr. almost certainly means the lions’ natural manes, not artificial crests (see E. L. B. Meurig Davies, [c dimgray]Mnemos.[/c] ser. 4, 2 \[1949\] 74).

For the horses would swerve aside to escape the wild lunge of the tusks, or rearing aloft pawed the air; but in vain, since you would see them collapse hamstrung and cover the ground in their heavy fall. If men before had thought any to be sufficiently tamed at home, in action they saw them grow hot with wounds and uproar, flight and terror and tumult, and found themselves unable to bring any part of them back; for all the different kinds of wild beasts would scatter abroad, as now the Lucanian oxen badly mangled with steel often scatter abroad, after they have dealt cruel deeds to many of their own friends.

	[c dimgray]1361[/c]But the pattern of sowing and the beginning
	of grafting first came from nature herself the maker of all things, since berries and acorns falling from trees in due time produced swarms of seedlings underneath; and this also gave them the fancy to insert shoots in the branches and to plant new slips in the earth all over the fields. Next one after
	another they tried ways of cultivating the little plot they loved, and saw wild fruits grow tame in the ground with kind treatment and friendly tillage. Day by day they made the forests climb higher up the mountains and yield the place below to their tilth, that they might have meadows, pools and streams, crops and luxuriant vineyards on hill and plain, and that a grey-green belt of olives might run between[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] to mark the boundaries, stretching forth over hills and dales and plains; just as now you see the whole place mapped out with charming variety, laid out and intersected with sweet fruit-trees and set about with fertile plantations.

	[c dimgray]1379[/c]To imitate with the mouth the liquid notes of
	the birds came long before men could delight their ears by warbling smooth carols in song. And the zephyrs whistling through hollow reeds first taught the countrymen to blow into hollow hemlock-stalks. Next, step by step they learnt the plaintive melodies
	which the reed-pipe gives forth tapped by the players’ fingertips[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—the pipe discovered amid pathless woods and forests and glades, amid the solitary haunts of shepherds and the peace of the open air. \[So by degrees time brings up before us every single thing, and reason lifts it into the precincts of light.\]

	[c dimgray]1412[/c]For what is ready to hand, unless we have
	known something more lovely before, gives preeminent delight and seems to hold the field, until something found afterwards to be better usually spoils all that and changes our taste for anything ancient. So men grew tired of acorns, so were deserted those old beds strewn with herbage and leaves piled up. The garment also of wild-beast pelt fell into contempt; which I can imagine must have excited such envy in those days when discovered, that he who first wore one was done to death by treachery, and even then that it was torn to pieces amongst them with much bloodshed and was lost and could not be turned to use. Then therefore pelts,
	now gold and purple, trouble men’s life with cares and weary it with war; in which, as I think, the greater fault rests upon us. For without the pelts, cold tormented the naked sons of earth; but we take no harm to be without a vestment of purple worked with gold and great figures, so long as there
	is the poor man’s cloak[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] to protect us.

	It was Athens of illustrious name that first in former
	days spread abroad the corn bearing crops amongst suffering mankind[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; Athens bestowed on them a new life and established laws; Athens first gave the sweet
	consolations of life, when she brought forth a man[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	endowed with such wisdom, who in past days poured forth all revelations from truth-telling lips[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]; whose glory, though his light is quenched,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] on account of his divine discoveries has been long since published abroad and is now exalted to the skies.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]9[/c]For when he saw how mortals had ready for them nearly all that need demands for living,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and that, as far as they could, their life was established safe; saw how men were rolling in riches, mighty in honour and fame, proud in the good repute of their sons, while at home nevertheless each had an anxious heart; saw how they tormented their life in their own despite without any pause, and were compelled to wax furious with racking lamentations[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]:—then

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The reference to Athens and [c dimgray]mortalibus aegris[/c] looks forward to the account of the Athenian plague (1138-1286), [c dimgray]aegris[/c] here being echoed by [c dimgray]aegris[/c] in 1152. Similarly [c dimgray]varieque volaret[/c] (30) anticipates [c dimgray]multarum semina rerum . . . quae sint morbo mortique necessest multa volare[/c] (1093, 1095-1096), where Lucr. is describing the cause of pestilences, and [c dimgray]anxia corda . . . querellis[/c] (14, 16) is echoed by [c dimgray]anxius angor . . . querella[/c] (1158-1159). These verbal parallelisms between the proem, with its emphasis on moral sickness and health, and the final passage confirm (see note on 1139) that Lucr. views the Athenian plague as a physical disaster that involved moral disaster as well, and as symbolizing the moral condition of unenlightened mankind.

Therefore with truth-telling words he scoured the heart, he put a limit to desire and fear, he showed what was that chief good[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] to which we all move, and pointed the way, that strait and narrow path by which we might run thither without turning; he showed what evil there was everywhere in human affairs, which comes about and flies about in different ways, whether by natural chance[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] or force, because nature had so provided, and from what sally-ports each ought to be countered; and he proved that mankind had no reason for the
	most part to roll the sad waves of trouble within unnecessary their breasts. For just as children tremble and fear all things in the blind darkness, so we in the light fear, at times, things that are no more to be feared than what children shiver at in the dark and imagine to be at hand.

Besides, clouds can neither be made of so dense a body as stones and wood, nor again so thin as mist and flying smoke; for then they must either fall thrust down by their dead weight, like stones, or, like smoke, be unable to hold together or to contain cold snow and showers of hail.

It often happens too that clouds cannot exactly meet front to front, but pass by the side in opposite directions, scraping their bodies as

	Thunder shake and tremble with a heavy thunderclap, and it seems that the great walls of the capacious firmament suddenly torn asunder have leapt apart, when and bursts a gale of strong wind gathered together has twisted itself all at once into the clouds, and enclosed in that same place, whirling round and round, compels the cloud more and more in every direction to form a hollow with a thick crust all round; afterwards, when the wind’s power and fierce impulse have weakened it, then the cloud is torn and explodes with a most horrifying crash. And no wonder, when a small bladder full of air often makes so loud a noise as it is suddenly burst.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]132[/c]There is another way whereby the clouds make
	a noise, that is, when the winds blow through them. through them For indeed we often see clouds branching in many ways, and ragged as they sweep along; just as, you may be sure, leaves rustle, and branches creak, when the blasts of the north-west wind blow through a thick forest.

	[c dimgray]137[/c]It sometimes happens also that the swift force
	or rends of strong wind tears through a cloud, breaking through with a direct rush. For what the blast can do there is plain from our own experience, when here on the earth, where it is gentler, it nevertheless tears up tall trees and wrenches them from their deepest roots.

	[c dimgray]142[/c]There are waves also amongst the clouds,

	receives the fire, it makes a great noise in destroying it at once, just as white-hot iron from the hot furnace often hisses when we have dipped it into cold water near by. If, further, the cloud be drier when it
	receives the lightning, it is suddenly kindled and burns up with a loud din, as if the mountains were covered with laurel, and a flame were driven over by a tempest of winds, consuming them with mighty rush; and there is no other thing that burns with more terrible sound in the crackling flames than the Delphic laurel of Phoebus.

	[c dimgray]173[/c]In this way also the clouds tinge places with
	swift light, and the storm flashes with a quivering rush. When wind has entered a cloud, and moving about within the same has made the cloud grow grows hot thick round the hollow, as I explained before,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] it becomes hot by its own quick movement; just as you see everything become very hot and catch fire by movement, and indeed a leaden bullet even melts when it is whirled a long distance.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] When therefore this burning wind has burst the black cloud, by violent pressure it seems suddenly to squeeze out
	and scatter abroad seeds of fire which cause the winking flashes of flame; then follows the sound, which is slower in striking the ears than what comes to the sight of our eyes. You may be sure that this is what happens, when clouds are thick and at the same time piled high one above another in a wonderful mass, that you may not be deceived because from below we see more readily how wide they are than how far they extend piled upwards. For do but apply your scrutiny when the winds carry clouds like mountains across through the air, or when you see them piled about the great mountains one above another, pressing down from above, and lying still with the winds deep buried on every side: then you will be able to recognize the great masses of them,
	and to perceive the similitude of caverns reared with vaulted roofs, which when a tempest arises the winds fill, and with loud roaring resent their imprisonment in the clouds, menacing like wild beasts in their

	cages: now this way now that way they send their growlings through the clouds, roaming round in quest
	of a way out, and rolling together the seeds of fire from the clouds, and thus they collect many such and send the flame rushing about the hollow furnaces within, until they have shattered the cloud and flashed forth coruscating.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]204[/c]Another reason why that golden colour of flowing
	fire swiftly flies down to the earth is that in themselves the clouds must have very many seeds of fire; for when they are free from all wetness, their colour is mostly flaming and shining. In truth they must receive many such seeds from the sun’s light, so that there is good cause why they should blush and pour forth fires. When therefore the wind driving these has crushed them together and crowded them up together in a confined space, they squeeze out and pour forth seeds which make the colours of flame to lighten.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]214[/c]It lightens also when the clouds grow thin in
	the sky as well. For when the wind gently disperses them[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] abroad and diffuses them abroad as they pass, those seeds which make lightning must fall perforce. Then the lightning comes without hideous terror and din and without noise.

Next, when the force of the wind has grown hot through and through and the strong impulse of the fire has thrust in, then the thunderbolt, now as it were ripe, suddenly cleaves the cloud, and out flies the speeded
	flame, sweeping over all places with flashing lights. Next follows a loud crash, so that the regions of the sky above seem suddenly to burst apart and overwhelm us. Then tremblings violently assail the earth, murmurs roll through the lofty sky, for then
	almost all the tempest quivers with the shock and roarings are aroused. From this shock follows rain heavy and full, so that the whole ether seems to be turning into rain, and thus tumbling violently down,

	bullet often grows hot in its course,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] when casting off many bodies of coldness it catches fire in the air.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]309[/c]It may be also that the very force of the blow
	produces fire, when a force of wind, sped forth cold without fire, has struck; doubtless because, when it has smitten with a violent blow, elements of heat may flow together from the wind itself and at the same time from that thing which then receives the blow; just as, when we strike stone with iron, out flies fire,
	like flint nor do the seeds of hot fire any the less run together at the blow because iron is a cold thing. So therefore also a thing must be kindled by the thunderbolt if it happens to be fit and proper for flames. And no force of wind can easily be completely and utterly cold which has been sped from above with such force, but, even if it is not first kindled by fire in its course, it must nevertheless arrive warm and mingled with heat.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]323[/c]The speed, moreover, and heavy blow of the
	thunderbolt comes about, and the bolts usually run with so quick a fall, because first of all within the clouds a force is always aroused and collects itself and takes on a mighty energy of movement, and then, when the cloud can no longer contain the increasing rush, the force is pressed out and therefore flies with a wonderful rush, like missiles which are hurled from powerful catapults.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]330[/c]Moreover, it consists of small and smooth elements,
	and it is not easy for anything to bar the way of such a substance, since it speeds in between[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and penetrates through narrow passages; therefore not many obstacles can delay it or check it, and so it flies smoothly with a swift rush.

	[c dimgray]335[/c]Then, moreover, all weights always naturally thrust downwards; but when a blow is added, the velocity is doubled, and that first impulse grows
	heavier, so that more violently and more quickly it disperses with its blows whatever meets it to bring delay, and follows its path.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]340[/c]Again, because it comes rushing from a long
	distance, it must add ever more and more to its greases with velocity, which grows by moving, increasing its distance. mighty strength and stiffening the blow. For this[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] causes all the seeds of the thunderbolt to be carried straight onwards, as one may say, into one place, driving them all together as they roll into that single path.

	[c dimgray]348[/c]And it passes through things without hurting
	them, leaving many intact after its transit, because the fire being fluid takes its way through them by of many their pores. And many it transpierces, when the without very particles of the thunderbolt have fallen upon the points where the particles of the things are joined in the texture. Furthermore, it easily dissolves

	therefore the temperature of the sky is set between the two, then all the different causes of the thunderbolt are combined. For the choppy currents[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of the year mingle cold and heat—each of which is necessary for the cloud to make thunderbolts—, so that there is discord amongst things, and the air billows furiously in wild tumult with fires and winds. For
	the first part of warmth is the last part of cold, that with cold is the spring-time, for which reason these unlike things must fight and make confusion when mixed together. And when the last heat mixed with the first cold comes round, which is called by the name of autumn time, here also bitter winters come into conflict with summers. This is why these are to be called the choppy currents of the year; and it is no wonder if at that time very many thunderbolts are made, and a turbulent tempest is stirred up in the sky, since all is confusion with well-matched warfare on both sides, on this part flames, and on that, winds and water commingled.

	[c dimgray]423[/c]To pass on, it is easy from these thoughts to
	understand in what way those things which the Greeks call from their nature [c dimgray]presteres[/c][c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] come down from above into the sea. For it happens at times from the that a kind of column let down from the sky comes down into the sea, around which the waters boil stirred up by the heavy blast of the winds; and if any ships are caught in that tumult, they are tossed about and come into great peril.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]431[/c]This happens when at times the force of the
	wind stirred up is unable to burst the cloud which it cannot attempts to burst, but depresses it so that it is like a column let down from the sky into the sea, little by little, as though something were being pushed and stretched out towards the waves by a fist and the thrust of an arm from above; and when the force of the wind has torn it asunder, it bursts forth from the cloud upon the sea and causes a wonderful boiling in the waves; for the whirlwind turns as it comes down, and brings down along with it that cloud of yielding body; but as soon as it has thrust down the teeming cloud upon the surface of the ocean,

	[c dimgray]495[/c]Now attend, and I will explain in what manner 6.
	rainy moisture[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] grows together in the clouds on high, because and how showers fall sent down upon the earth, First of all you will concede that many seeds of water clouds, rise upward together with the clouds themselves from things of all sorts, and that in this way both grow together, the clouds and whatever water is in the clouds, just as in ourselves body grows along with blood, sweat also and in a word whatever moisture is in the frame. The clouds also often take up a great deal of sea-water besides, like hanging fleeces of wool, when the winds carry clouds above the great sea. In like fashion water is raised to the clouds from all rivers. And when into these clouds
	very many seeds of waters in many ways have gathered together, being increased from all sides, the discharge it clouds stuffed full strive to discharge the moisture in two ways: for the force of the wind thrusts them
	together, and the very mass of the clouds, when a greater pack than usual has been collected, pushes and presses down from above and makes the showers flow out. Besides where the clouds are blown thin
	by the winds, or loosened abroad, struck from above by the sun’s heat, they emit rainy moisture and drip, melted by as wax over a hot fire melts and grows fluid apace.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]517[/c]But there is a violent downpour of rain, when
	the clouds are violently pressed by both forces, by their own pile and by the rushing of the wind. But rains are accustomed to persist and linger for a great
	while, when many seeds of waters are put in motion and clouds over clouds, storm-rack over storm-rack are carried along from every part, streaming from above, and when the earth smoking breathes back the moisture everywhere.

	[c dimgray]577[/c]There is also another cause of the same great
	trembling, when wind or a very great force of air, either from without or arising within the earth itself has thrown itself suddenly into the hollow places of the earth, and there in the great caverns first growls tumultuously and is carried whirling about, afterwards the force thus excited and driven outwards bursts forth, and at the same time cleaving the earth asunder makes a great chasm. This befell at Syrian Sidon, and came to pass at Aegium[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in the Peloponnese, when such an issue of air overthrew those cities with the earthquake that followed. Many another city wall has fallen by great quakings in the earth,
	many cities have sunk down to the bottom of the sea along with their inhabitants.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]591[/c]But if there is no breaking forth, yet the impetuous
	air itself and the furious force of wind is distributed abroad through the many interstices of the earth like an ague, and thus transmits the trembling; just as, when cold penetrates deep into our limbs, it shakes them, making them tremble and quake against our will. Therefore men shiver in their cities with a twofold terror: they fear the houses above, they dread the caverns below, lest the earth’s nature loosen all asunder in a moment, or torn asunder open abroad her own gaping jaws, and in confusion seek to gorge it with her own ruins.

	[c dimgray]608[/c]In the first place,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] men wonder that nature
	does not increase the measure of the sea, for all the great running down of waters thither, for all the rivers that come into it from every side. Add the wandering showers, the flying tempests, which sprinkle and drench all seas and lands; add the sea’s own fountains[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; yet all compared with the whole mass of the sea will be scarce equal to the augmentation of one single drop; which makes it less wonderful that the great sea does not increase.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]623[/c]Then further the winds also can lift a goodly

	[c dimgray]631[/c]Lastly, since the earth has a porous body, and it is joined together with the sea, girdling its shores all around, it is necessary that, as the flow of water comes from the land into the sea, so also it should
	ooze into the land from the salt sea; for the pungency is strained off, and the substance of the water oozes back, and all meets at the sources of each river, whence it returns over the earth in a moving mass of sweet water along the path which has once been cut for it in its liquid course.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]655[/c]For is there any of us who feels wonder, if someone has got into his limbs a fever that gathers with burning heat, or any other pain from disease seeds which throughout his body? For the foot suddenly swells, a sharp aching often seizes the teeth, or invades the eyes themselves, the accursed fire[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] appears creeping over the body and burning each part it takes hold on, and crawls over the limbs, assuredly because there are seeds of many things, and this earth and sky produce enough noxious disease that from it may grow forth an immeasurable quantity of disease. In this way therefore we must believe that a supply of all things is brought up from the infinite to the whole many heaven and earth, enough to enable the earth on a sudden to quake and move, the swift whirlwind to scour over land and sea, Etna’s fires to overflow, the heaven to burst in a blaze; for that also happens, the regions of heaven burn, and rainy tempests appear with heavier increment, when by some chance the seeds of waters have gathered to that effect.

	[c dimgray]680[/c]Nevertheless I will now explain in what ways
	the flame is excited which suddenly breathes out of the vast furnaces of Etna. Firstly, the whole mountain is hollow beneath, being supported for the caverns most part upon caverns in the basalt rock. In all the caverns, moreover, is wind and air; for wind arises when the air is excited by driving about. When this wind has grown hot, and has heated all the surrounding rocks by its fury wherever it touches, and also the earth, and from these has struck out hot fire
	with quick flames, it rises and throws itself upwards has grown straight through the mountain’s throat. Thus it carries its fire afar, scatters ashes far abroad, rolls the smoke all thick and black, thrusts out at the same time rocks of wonderful weight; so that you may be sure that this is the turbulent force of air.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]694[/c]Besides, around a great part of the mountain’s roots the sea breaks its waves and sucks back its surf. From this sea, caverns reach underground right to the lofty throat of the mountain. By these we must admit that \[wind mingled with water\] passes in, and that the nature of the case compels \[it often to rise\][c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and to penetrate completely within from
	the open sea, and to blow out the flame and so to uplift it on high, and cast up the rocks and raise clouds of sand; for on the topmost summit are craters, as they themselves[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] call them, what we speak of as the throat or the mouth.

	[c dimgray]712[/c]The Nile, the river of all Egypt, is the only
	river in the world that swells and overflows on the fields towards summer-time. It is accustomed to irrigate Egypt through the middle heats, either because there are northerly winds in summer opposite to its mouth, which at that time of year are called etesian[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] winds, and these, blowing against
	the stream, hold it back, and driving the waters up channel fill it and force it to stand. For beyond a doubt these blasts, which are driven from the cold back, stars of the pole, do blow against the current.

	[c dimgray]740[/c]In the first place, their name Avernian has been bestowed upon them because of their character, being dangerous to all birds, because when
	they have come in flight straight over those places, forgetting their oarage of wings and slackening their sails, headlong they fall, sinking down with limp neck to the ground, if it so happens that the nature of the place allows it, or into the water, if it happens that a lake of Avernus lies below.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]781[/c]Again, you may see how many things have for
	man a violently noxious sensation, being loathsome and dangerous. Firstly, certain trees[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] have a shade so dangerous that they often cause headache, if one has lain beneath stretched out on the herbage. There is also in the great mountains of Helicon a tree, which is accustomed to kill men by the vile stench of its flower. You may be sure that the reason why all these things rise from the soil is that the earth has many seeds of many things which she holds mixed up in many ways and separates apart before passing them on. And when a night-light newly extinguished meets
	the nostrils with a sharp smell, it stupefies on the spot one who is accustomed to fall and foam at the mouth through disease.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] The heavy scent of castor[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	makes a woman fall back asleep, dropping the dainty work from her tender hands, if she has smelt it at the time of her monthly courses. And many other things besides loosen the languid limbs all through the frame and shake the spirit in its habitations within. Again, if you should ever tarry long in the hot baths
	after a full meal, how easily you often collapse in the middle of the bath of hot water! And how easily the strong heavy fumes of charcoal creep into the
	brain, unless we have taken water before! But when a burning fever is in possession of a man’s limbs, then

	of silver and gold, rummaging with their tools the innermost secret places of the earth, what smells Scaptensula[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] exhales from below!

And when it has fallen there, then the same force of this exhalation takes from all the members what remains of life. For at first indeed it seems to excite in them a sort of giddiness[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]; afterwards, when they have fallen into the very fountains of poison, in that place life also has to be vomited forth, because there is so great a store of mischief around them.

	empty pocket is left here. And when they have come flying straight over this place, the beat of their wings suddenly goes halting and ineffective, and all wings. the effort of the pinions on either side is wasted. In this case, when they cannot find rest or support on their wings, nature assuredly forces them to fall down to the earth by their own weight, and through this almost empty space they, as they now lie, disperse abroad their souls through all the pores of the body.

	[c dimgray]840[/c]Furthermore, water grows colder in wells when
	it is summer, because the earth is rarefied by the heat and sends abroad into the air any seeds of heat which it has of its own. The more therefore the earth is summer, exhausted of its heat, the colder becomes that water which is hidden in the earth. When again all the earth is crushed by cold and congeals and, as it were, the air; grows together, the result naturally is that by congealing it presses out into the wells any heat it has in itself.

	the earth with terrifying blackness. But this is very far removed from true reasoning. For when the sun, acting upon the exposed body of water, was unable to make it hot on its upper part, although his light above is possessed of heat so great, how could he when under so gross a body of earth boil the water through the earth and soak it with warming heat? Especially when he can scarcely make his warmth pass through the walls of a house for all his burning rays.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]861[/c]How comes it then? Assuredly because the
	ground keeps more porous about the spring than the rest of the earth, and there are many seeds of fire near the body of water. Therefore when night has overwhelmed the earth with its dewy waves, the earth suddenly grows cold to the heart and contracts; in this fashion, as though compressed by a hand, it presses out into the spring whatever seeds of fire it has, which cause the warm touch and heat of the water. Next when the sun rising has stirred apart
	the earth with his rays and made it porous as his warming heat mingles with it, the first-beginnings of fire return to their ancient places, and all the heat’ warmth of the water passes into the earth. For this reason the spring becomes cold in the daylight.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]874[/c]Besides, the fluid of the water is tossed about
	by the sun’s rays, and the quivering heat makes it the porous at the coming of light; for which reason it discharges all its seeds of fire, just as water often discharges the cold which it contains, and melts the ice and loosens its knots.

	be held it often throws out flame, catching fire at
	once, and a torch in like manner is kindled and shines amidst the waters, wherever it floats driven by the winds: surely because there are in the water very many seeds of heat, and from deep down in the earth itself bodies of fire must rise through the whole spring and at the same time be exhaled and come out into the air, yet not so many as to make the spring hot. Besides, there is a force that compels
	them suddenly to break out through the water dispersed abroad, and then gather together above it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]890[/c]This is like the spring of Aradus[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in the sea, up fresh which splashes out sweet water and keeps away the salt waters around; and in many another region the sea offers timely blessings to sailors athirst, by vomiting out sweet waters amid the salt. In this way then those seeds can burst out through the other spring and splash out; and when they meet together on the tow or adhere to the body of the torch, they easily blaze up in a moment, because the tow and floating torches also have many seeds of fire within them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]900[/c]Do you not see also that, if you move a
	wick newly extinguished near a night-light, it kindles before touching the flame, and the same with a torch? And many other things, touched just by the heat, blaze up at some distance before the fire comes close and drenches it. This then is what we must believe to happen in that spring too.

For you may sometimes see five or more hanging in a string and swayed by a light breeze, where one hangs from another attached beneath it, and one from another learns the stone’s power and attraction: to such a distance does its power hold force, oozing through and through.

	[c dimgray]921[/c]In the first place, from everything that we see
	there must of necessity continually flow and discharge and scatter bodies which strike our eyes and excite vision. There is a continual flow of odours from thing, certain things, as there is of cold from rivers, heat from the sun, spray from the sea-waves, that devourer of walls beside the shore. Manifold sounds also ooze through the air without ever slackening. Again, a moisture salt to the taste often comes into our mouth when we walk by the sea, and when we see wormwood being mixed with water in our presence, we have a sense of bitterness. So true is it that from all things the different qualities pass off in a flow, and disperse in every direction around; there is no delay, no rest to interrupt the flow, since we

	First of all, in caverns the rocks above sweat with moisture and trickle with oozing drops. Sweat oozes
	also from our whole body; the beard grows, and hairs over all our limbs and our frame. Food is distributed
	abroad into all the veins, increasing and nourishing even the extreme parts of the body and the nails. Cold also and warming heat we feel to pass through bronze, we feel them likewise to pass through gold and through silver, when we hold full cups.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	Again, in a house voices flit through dividing walls
	of stone, smell oozes through, and cold and the heat of fire, which is also accustomed to penetrate iron for all its strength. Again, where the corslet of heaven encompasses us, \[the bodies which make clouds
	and storm-rack penetrate\],[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and the power of disease at the same time, when it comes in from without; and tempests arising from earth and sky quite naturally move away withdrawn into sky or earth, since nothing exists that does not have a porous texture.

	things are endowed with the same effect on the senses,
	or suited for all things in the same way. In the first place, the sun bakes the earth and makes it dry, but he melts ice and with his rays compels to thaw snow piled up high on the high mountains. Again, when placed in his heat wax liquefies. Fire also makes
	bronze melt and dissolves gold, but skins and flesh it contracts and shrivels up. The liquid of water again
	hardens iron taken from the fire, but skins and flesh it softens after they have been hardened by heat. The wild olive gives as great a delight to the bearded
	nanny-goat as if it were really running with ambrosia and bathed in nectar; yet there is no green growth which is more bitter to man than this foliage. Again, the pig flees from oil of marjoram and fears every kind of

	[c dimgray]979[/c]Another thing yet remains which it seems best
	to say before I approach my proper theme. Since there are many pores to be found in different things, they must be endowed with different natures, each having its own nature and its own passages. For in truth there are different senses in living creatures, each of which perceives in itself the object proper to it; for we observe sound to penetrate by one sense, taste from flavours by another, by another again the smell of odours.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1002[/c]In the first place, it must be that very many seeds flow out from this stone, or, let us say, a current which by its blows beats away all the air that lies between the stone and the iron. When this space is made empty and a large place becomes vacant
	between, at once the first-beginnings of the iron gliding forward into the empty space fall in a body together, and the result is that the ring itself follows and passes in this way as a whole. And indeed there
	is nothing that has its first elements more intertwined, nothing more closely connected together and coherent, than the substance of strong iron with its chilly roughness. For this reason it is less surprising . . .[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] if the large number of bodies emanating from the iron cannot move into the void without the ring itself following; this it does, and follows until it has reached that very stone and clung to it by unseen attachments. The same thing happens in all directions: wherever an empty space is formed, whether on the sides or above, the neighbouring bodies at

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1022[/c]Moreover, to make the process easier, this matter also is added as an aid to the ring’s movement, namely that as soon as the air is made thinner in front of the ring and the space more void and empty, it follows at once that all the air that is behind the
	ring pushes it forward as it were and propels it for ward from the rear. For the air all round is for ever buffeting things; but the reason why it propels the iron at that moment is that on one side there is empty space which receives it. This air that I speak of insinuates itself in subtle fashion through the many interstices in the iron into its small particles, thrusting and driving it on as the wind drives a ship with its sails.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Again, all things must have air in their body,
	since they are of porous structure, and air surrounds and adjoins all things. This air, therefore, which is hidden in the inmost parts of the iron, is always being agitated with restless movement, and therefore beats the ring without doubt and sets it moving from within; the ring is assuredly carried in that direction whither it has once flung itself forward and taken its impulse towards the void.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1042[/c]Sometimes also the iron recedes from this
	stone, being accustomed to flee and follow in turns, I have even seen Samothracian iron[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] dance, and at the same time iron filings go mad in a bronze bowl, when this magnet stone was applied underneath: so eager seems the iron to escape from the stone. When

	the bronze comes between, all this quarrel is caused, because doubtless when the current from the bronze has come first and taken possession of the open channels of the iron, afterwards comes the current
	from the stone to find all full in the iron, and no way to swim through as it had before: it is therefore compelled to beat and buffet the iron texture with its flood; and in this way it rejects from itself and sets moving through the bronze that which without the bronze it often sucks back.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]1056[/c]In this connexion, you must not allow yourself
	to feel surprise that the current from this stone has not the power to propel other things also. For some stand firm by their weight, of which kind is gold; while others, because they are of a body so porous that the current flies through unresisted, cannot be propelled anywhere, in which kind the substance of
	wood is seen to be. Between the two, then, nature of iron, and when it receives certain minute bodies of bronze, the result is that the magnet stones tides have drive it by their flow.

	[c dimgray]1065[/c]But yet these properties are not so alien to
	other things that I could not find good store of similar examples to hand which I might mention, of things that have affinity for each other and for nothing else. Firstly you see stones cemented by mortar

And as we see these four climates to be diverse under the four winds and quarters of heaven, so the colour and aspect of men are seen to be widely different and diseases to possess the nations after their kind. There is the elephant disease[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] which is found by the river of Nile in mid-Egypt and nowhere else. In Attica the feet are attacked, the eyes in the Achaean district.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Traditionally the first king of Athens. Lucr.’s account of the plague of 430 b.c. is closely based on Thucydides 2.47-52. However, as H. S. Commager Jr. has shown in [c dimgray]Harv. Stud.[/c] 62 (1957) 105-118, he sees the plague not merely as a physical disaster, but also as a moral calamity and as symbolic of man’s spiritual unenlightenment. This ([c dimgray]a[/c]) accounts for his departures from Thuc.’s account, ([c dimgray]b[/c]) explains why he places the passage at the end of his poem, ([c dimgray]c[/c]) shows that his account is not indicative (as some have thought) of morbid pessimism. The idea that the unenlightened are morally diseased is common in Epicureanism ([c dimgray]cf. e.g.[/c] Cicero, [c dimgray]Fin.[/c] 1.18.59, Diogenes of Oenoanda fr. 3.IV.3-VI.4 Smith) and is prominent in the proem to this book (see note on 1-2), where it is emphasized that this spiritual sickness is self-inflicted and, thanks to Epicurus, can be completely cured. The truth is that the prospect of salvation and of a heaven on earth which Lucr. offers in the [c dimgray]DRN[/c] shines with a brighter and stronger light on account of this dark and hellish picture of what life is like without the guidance of Epicurus—in much the same way that in the myth in Plato’s [c dimgray]Phaedo[/c] the brilliance and colourfulness and beauty of life on the surface of the real earth (110 b 5 ff.) is intensified by the following account (111 c 4 ff.) of the grim subterranean regions.

After that, when passing through the throat the fell disease had filled the chest and had flooded into the sorrowful mind[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of the sufferer, then indeed all the barriers of life did totter. The breath rolled out a foul stench, like the penetrating smell of rotting corpses thrown out unburied. And then all the
	powers of the mind, the whole body, grew faint, being now on the very threshold of death. These intolerable sufferings were ever attended by torments of anxiety and laments mingled with moans.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Retching persisted often through night and day, constantly causing cramps in the muscles and limbs, which quite broke them up, wearying those who were already wearied out.

Relentlessly the sinews in the hands twitched, the limbs trembled, from the feet cold crept up by inches. At the latter end also the nostrils were compressed, the tip of the nose grew sharp, the eyes were sunken, the temples hollow, the skin cold and hard, the mouth agape and grinning, the forehead remaining tense.
