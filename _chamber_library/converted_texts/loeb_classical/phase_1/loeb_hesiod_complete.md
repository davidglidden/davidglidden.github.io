	(1) Let us begin to sing from the Heliconian Muses,
	who possess the great and holy mountain of Helicon, and
	dance on their soft feet around the violet-dark fountain
	and the altar of Cronus’ mighty son.
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] And after they have
	washed their tender skin in Permessus or Hippocrene
	or holy Olmeius, they perform choral dances on highest
	Helicon, beautiful, lovely ones, and move nimbly with
	their feet. Starting out from there, shrouded in thick invisibility,
	by night they walk, sending forth their very beautiful
	voice, singing of aegis-holding Zeus, and queenly Hera
	of Argos, who walks in golden sandals, and the daughter
	of aegis-holding Zeus, bright-eyed Athena, and Phoebus
	Apollo, and arrow-shooting Artemis, and earth-holding,
	earth-shaking Poseidon, and venerated Themis (Justice)
	and quick-glancing Aphrodite, and golden-crowned Hebe
	(Youth) and beautiful Dione, and Leto and Iapetus and
	crooked-counseled Cronus, and Eos (Dawn) and great

	Helius (Sun) and gleaming Selene (Moon), and Earth and
	great Ocean and black Night, and the holy race of the other
	immortals who always are.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(22) One time, they
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] taught Hesiod beautiful song
	while he was pasturing lambs under holy Helicon. And this
	speech the goddesses spoke first of all to me, the Olympian
	Muses, the daughters of aegis-holding Zeus: “Field-dwelling
	shepherds, ignoble disgraces, mere bellies: we know
	how to say many false things similar to genuine ones, but
	we know, when we wish, how to proclaim true things.”
	So spoke great Zeus’ ready-speaking daughters, and they
	plucked a staff, a branch of luxuriant laurel, a marvel, and
	gave it to me; and they breathed a divine voice into me, so
	that I might glorify what will be and what was before, and
	they commanded me to sing of the race of the blessed ones
	who always are, but always to sing of themselves first and
	last.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(35) But what is this to me, about an oak or a rock?
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]
	Come then, let us begin from the Muses, who by singing
	for their father Zeus give pleasure to his great mind within
	Olympus, telling of what is and what will be and what was
	before, harmonizing in their sound. Their tireless voice
	flows sweet from their mouths; and the house of their
	father, loud-thundering Zeus, rejoices at the goddesses’
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The Muses.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]A proverbial expression, possibly already so for Hesiod; its
	origin is obscure but its meaning here is evidently, “Why should I
	waste time speaking about irrelevant matters?”

	lily-like voice as it spreads out, and snowy Olympus’ peak
	resounds, and the mansions of the immortals. Sending
	forth their deathless voice, they glorify in their song first
	the venerated race of the gods from the beginning, those to
	whom Earth and broad Sky gave birth, and those who were
	born from these, the gods givers of good things; second,
	then, the goddesses, both beginning and ending their
	song, sing
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] of Zeus, the father of gods and of men, how
	much he is the best of the gods and the greatest in supremacy;
	and then, singing of the race of human beings and of
	the mighty Giants, they give pleasure to Zeus’ mind within
	Olympus, the Olympian Muses, the daughters of aegis-holding Zeus.

	(53) Mnemosyne (Memory) bore them on Pieria, mingling
	in love with the father, Cronus’ son—Mnemosyne,
	the protectress of the hills of Eleuther—as forgetfulness of
	evils and relief from anxieties.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] For the counsellor Zeus
	slept with her for nine nights, apart from the immortals,
	going up into the sacred bed; and when a year had passed,
	and the seasons had revolved as the months waned, and
	many days had been completed, she bore nine maidens—like-minded
	ones, who in their breasts care for song and
	have a spirit that knows no sorrow—not far from snowy
	Olympus’ highest peak. That is where their bright choral
	dances and their beautiful mansions are, and beside them

	(68) They went towards Olympus at that time, exulting
	in their beautiful voice, with a deathless song; and around
	them the black earth resounded as they sang, and from under
	their feet a lovely din rose up as they traveled to their
	father. He is king in the sky, holding the thunder and the
	blazing thunderbolt himself, since he gained victory in supremacy
	over his father Cronus; and he distributed well all
	things alike to the immortals and devised their honors.

	(383) Styx, Ocean’s daughter, mingling with Pallas,
	bore Zelus (Rivalry) and beautiful-ankled Nike (Victory)
	in her house, and she gave birth to Cratos (Supremacy) and
	Bia (Force), eminent children. These have no house apart
	from Zeus nor any seat, nor any path except that on which
	the god leads them, but they are always seated next to
	deep-thundering Zeus. For this is what Styx, Ocean’s eternal
	daughter, planned on the day when the Olympian
	lightener
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c] summoned all the immortal gods to high Olympus
	and said that, whoever of the gods would fight together
	with him against the Titans, him he would not strip of his
	privileges, but that every one would have the honor he had
	had before among the immortal gods; and that whoever
	had been without honor and without privilege because of
	Cronus, him he would raise to honor and privileges, as is
	established right. So eternal Styx came first of all to Olympus
	with her own children, through the plans of her dear
	father; and Zeus honored her and gave her exceptional
	gifts. For he set her to be the great oath of the gods, and
	her sons to dwell with him for all their days. Just as he
	promised, so too he fulfilled for all, through and through;
	and he himself rules mightily and reigns.

	(411) And she became pregnant and bore Hecate,
	whom Zeus, Cronus’ son, honored above all others: he
	gave her splendid gifts—to have a share of the earth and of
	the barren sea, and from the starry sky as well she has a
	share in honor, and is honored most of all by the immortal
	gods. For even now, whenever any human on the earth
	seeks propitiation by performing fine sacrifices according
	to custom, he invokes Hecate; and much honor very easily
	stays with that man whose prayers the goddess accepts
	with gladness, and she bestows happiness upon him, for
	this power she certainly has. For of all those who came
	forth from Earth and Sky and received honor, among all of
	these she has her due share; and neither did Cronus’ son
	use force against her nor did he deprive her of anything
	that she had received as her portion among the Titans, the
	earlier gods, but she is still in possession according to the
	division as it was made at first from the beginning. Nor
	does the goddess, just because she is an only child, have a
	lesser share of honor and privileges on earth and in sky and
	sea, but instead she has far more, since Zeus honors her.
	She stands mightily at the side of whomever she wishes
	and helps him. In the assembly, whoever she wishes is conspicuous
	among the people; and when men arm themselves
	for man-destroying war, the goddess stands there
	by the side of whomever she wishes, zealously to grant
	victory and to stretch forth glory. She sits in judgment beside
	reverend kings; and again, she is good whenever men

	Great Cronus would swallow these down as each one came
	from his mother’s holy womb to her knees, mindful lest
	anyone else of Sky’s illustrious children should have the
	honor of kingship among the immortals. For he had heard
	from Earth and starry Sky that, mighty though he was, he
	was destined to be overpowered by a child of his, through
	the plans of great Zeus. For this reason, then, he held no
	unseeing watch, but observed closely, and swallowed down
	his children; and unremitting grief gripped Rhea. But
	when she was about to bear Zeus, the father of gods and of
	men, she beseeched her own dear parents, Earth and
	starry Sky, to contrive some scheme so that she could bear
	her dear son without being noticed, and take retribution
	for the avenging deities of her father and of her children,
	whom great crooked-counseled Cronus had swallowed
	down. They listened well to their dear daughter and
	obeyed her, and they revealed to her everything that was
	fated to come about concerning Cronus the king and his
	strong-spirited son. They told her to go to Lyctus, to the
	rich land of Crete, when she was about to bear the youngest
	of her children, great Zeus; and huge Earth received
	him in broad Crete to nurse him and rear him up. There
	she came first to Lyctus, carrying him through the swift
	black night; taking him in her hands she concealed him in a

	the Aegean mountain, abounding with forests. And she

	a settlement
	[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c] in Mecone, with eager spirit he divided up a
	great ox and, trying to deceive Zeus’ mind, set it before
	him. For he set down on the skin before him the meat and
	the innards, rich with fat, hiding them in the ox’s stomach;
	and then he set down before him in turn the ox’s white
	bones, arranging them with deceptive craft, hiding them
	with gleaming fat.

	(545) So spoke in mockery Zeus, who knows eternal

	craft: “Zeus, most renowned, greatest of the eternally
	living gods, choose from these whichever your spirit
	in your breast bids you.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(550) So he spoke, plotting deception. But Zeus, who
	knows eternal counsels, recognized the deception and did
	not fail to perceive it; and he saw in his spirit evils for mortal
	human beings—ones that were going to be fulfilled,
	too. With both hands he grasped the white fat, and he became

	[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c]This passage has been much misunderstood and often

	you are telling us. We too know ourselves that your
	thoughts are supreme and your mind is supreme, and that
	you have revealed yourself as a protector for the immortals
	against chilly ruin. It is by your prudent plans that we have

	from implacable bonds—something, Lord, Cronus’ son,
	that we no longer hoped to experience. For that reason,

	dismal battle, the females and the males, on that day, both
	the Titan gods and those who were born from Cronus, and
	those whom Zeus sent up towards the light from Erebus,
	out from under the earth, terrible and mighty, with defiant
	strength. A hundred arms sprang forth from their shoulders,
	in the same way for all of them, and upon their massive
	limbs grew fifty heads out of each one’s shoulders.
	They took up their positions against the Titans in baleful
	conflict, holding enormous boulders in their massive
	hands; and on the other side the Titans zealously reinforced
	their battle-ranks. Both sides manifested the deed
	of hands and of strength together. The boundless ocean
	echoed terribly around them, and the great earth crashed,
	and the broad sky groaned in response as it was shaken,

	all at once from his massive hand. All around, the life-giving
	earth roared as it burned, and all around the great
	immense forest crackled; the whole earth boiled, and the
	streams of Ocean and the barren sea. The hot blast encompassed
	the earthly Titans, and an immense blaze reached
	the divine aether, and the brilliant gleam of the lightning
	bolt and flash blinded their eyes, powerful though
	they were. A prodigious conflagration took possession of
	Chasm; and to look upon it with eyes and to hear its sound
	with ears, it seemed just as when Earth and broad Sky approached
	from above:

	between Sky and Earth.

	him, scourging him with blows, he fell down lamed,

	as he was struck, and the huge earth was much burned by
	the prodigious blast, and it melted like tin when it is heated

	(869) From Typhoeus comes the strength of moist-blowing

	(881) When the blessed gods had completed their toil,
	and by force had reached a settlement with the Titans
	regarding honors, then by the counsels of Earth they
	urged far-seeing Zeus to become king and to rule over the
	immortals; and he divided their honors well for them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(886) Zeus, king of the gods, took as his first wife Metis
	(Wisdom), she who of the gods and mortal human beings
	knows the most. But when she was about to give birth to
	the goddess, bright-eyed Athena, he deceived her mind by
	craft and with guileful words he put her into his belly, by
	the counsels of Earth and of starry Sky: for this was how
	they had prophesied to him, lest some other one of the
	eternally living gods hold the kingly honor instead of Zeus.
	For it was destined that exceedingly wise children would
	come to be from her: first she would give birth to a maiden,
	bright-eyed Tritogeneia,
	[c dimgray][sup]43[/sup][/c] possessing strength equal to her
	father’s and wise counsel, and then to a son, a king of gods
	and of men, possessing a very violent heart. But before that
	could happen Zeus put her into his belly, so that the goddess
	would advise him about good and evil.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(901) Second, he married bright Themis, who gave
	birth to the Horae (Seasons), Eunomia (Lawfulness) and
	Dike (Justice) and blooming Eirene (Peace), who care for
	the works of mortal human beings, and the Destinies,
	upon whom the counsellor Zeus bestowed the greatest
	honor, Clotho and Lachesis and Atropos, who give to mortal
	human beings both good and evil to have.

	mortal loves that one, but it is by necessity that they honor
	the oppressive Strife, by the plans of the immortals. But
	the other one gloomy Night bore first; and Cronus’ high-throned
	son, who dwells in the aether, set it in the roots of
	the earth, and it is much better for men. It rouses even the
	helpless man to work. For a man who is not working but
	who looks at some other man, a rich one who is hastening
	to plow and plant and set his house in order, he envies
	him, one neighbor envying his neighbor who is hastening
	towards wealth: and this Strife is good for mortals. And
	potter is angry with potter, and builder with builder, and
	beggar begrudges beggar, and poet poet.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(27) Perses, do store this up in your spirit, lest gloating
	Strife keep your spirit away from work, while you gawk
	at quarrels and listen to the assembly. For he has little care
	for quarrels and assemblies, whoever does not have plentiful
	means of life stored up indoors in good season, what the
	earth bears, Demeter’s grain. When you can take your fill
	of that, then you might foster quarrels and conflict for
	the sake of another man’s wealth. But you will not have a
	second chance to act this way—no, let us decide our quarrel
	right here with straight judgments, which come from
	Zeus, the best ones. For already we had divided up our allotment,
	but you snatched much more besides and went
	carrying it off, greatly honoring the kings, those gift-eaters,
	who want to pass this judgment—fools, they do not know

	(42) For the gods keep the means of life concealed from
	human beings. Otherwise you would easily be able to work
	in just one day so as to have enough for a whole year even
	without working, and quickly you would store the rudder
	above the smoke, and the work of the cattle and of the

	crooked-counseled Prometheus (Forethought) had deceived

	human beings, and he concealed fire; but the good son of

	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] stole it back from the counsellor Zeus in a hollow
	fennel-stalk for human beings, escaping the notice of Zeus
	who delights in the thunderbolt.

	(53) But the cloud-gatherer Zeus spoke to him in anger:
	“Son of Iapetus, you who know counsels beyond all others,
	you are pleased that you have stolen fire and beguiled my
	mind—a great grief for you yourself, and for men to come.

	(109) Golden was the race of speech-endowed human
	beings which the immortals, who have their mansions
	on Olympus, made first of all. They lived at the time of
	Cronus, when he was king in the sky; just like gods they
	spent their lives, with a spirit free from care, entirely apart
	from toil and distress. Worthless old age did not oppress
	them, but they were always the same in their feet and
	hands, and delighted in festivities, lacking in all evils; and
	they died as if overpowered by sleep. They had all good
	things: the grain-giving field bore crops of its own accord,
	much and unstinting, and they themselves, willing, mild-mannered,
	shared out the fruits of their labors together
	with many good things, wealthy in sheep, dear to the
	blessed gods. But since the earth covered up this race, by
	the plans of great Zeus they are fine spirits upon the earth,
	guardians of mortal human beings: they watch over judgments
	and cruel deeds, clad in invisibility, walking everywhere
	upon the earth, givers of wealth; and this kingly
	honor they received.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(127) Afterwards those who have their mansions on
	Olympus made a second race, much worse, of silver, like
	the golden one neither in body nor in mind. A boy would
	be nurtured for a hundred years at the side of his cherished
	mother, playing in his own house, a great fool. But when
	they reached adolescence and arrived at the full measure

	themselves from wicked outrage against each other,
	nor were they willing to honor the immortals or to sacrifice
	upon the holy altars of the blessed ones, as is established
	right for human beings in each community. Then Zeus,

	Their weapons were of bronze, bronze were their houses,

	(156) When the earth covered up this race too, Zeus,
	Cronus’ son, made another one in turn upon the bounteous
	earth, a fourth one, more just and superior, the godly
	race of men-heroes, who are called demigods, the generation
	before our own upon the boundless earth. Evil war
	and dread battle destroyed these, some under seven-gated
	Thebes in the land of Cadmus while they fought for the
	sake of Oedipus’ sheep, others brought in boats over the
	great gulf of the sea to Troy for the sake of fair-haired
	Helen. There the end of death shrouded some of them,
	but upon others Zeus the father, Cronus’ son, bestowed
	life and habitations far from human beings and settled
	them at the limits of the earth; and these dwell with a spirit
	free of care on the Islands of the Blessed beside deep-eddying
	Ocean—happy heroes, for whom the grain-giving
	field bears honey-sweet fruit flourishing three times a
	year.

	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c]After this line, two papyri transmit the following lines, 173a-e
	(line 173a is also found in a few other sources): “far from human
	beings. Among these Cronus is king. For the father of men and of
	gods freed him himself; and now among these he always has
	honor, as is fitting. Zeus established another race of mortal human
	beings in turn, those who have now come into being upon the
	bounteous earth.” This passage is most likely a very late interpolation,
	designed to reconcile Zeus with Cronus and to provide the
	fifth race with an introduction similar to that of the first four.

	(202) And now I will tell a fable to kings who themselves
	too have understanding. This is how the hawk addressed
	the colorful-necked nightingale, carrying her high
	up among the clouds, grasping her with its claws, while she
	wept piteously, pierced by the curved claws; he said to her
	forcefully, “Silly bird, why are you crying out? One far
	superior to you is holding you. You are going wherever I
	shall carry you, even if you are a singer; I shall make you
	my dinner if I wish, or I shall let you go. Stupid he who
	would wish to contend against those stronger than he is:
	for he is deprived of the victory, and suffers pains in addition
	to his humiliations.” So spoke the swift-flying hawk,
	the long-winged bird.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(213) As for you, Perses, give heed to Justice and do not
	foster Outrageousness. For Outrageousness is evil in a
	worthless mortal; and even a fine man cannot bear her easily,
	but encounters calamities and then is weighed down
	under her. The better road is the one towards what is just,
	passing her by on the other side. Justice wins out over Outrageousness
	when she arrives at the end; but the fool only
	knows this after he has suffered. For at once Oath starts to
	run along beside crooked judgments, and there is a clamor
	when Justice is dragged where men, gift-eaters, carry her
	off and pronounce verdicts with crooked judgments; but
	she stays, weeping, with the city and the people’s abodes,

	Cronus’ son brings forth woe from the sky, famine together

	down with crooked judgments and have no care for the
	gods’ retribution. Thrice ten thousand are Zeus’ immortal
	guardians of mortal human beings upon the bounteous
	earth, and they watch over judgments and cruel deeds,
	clad in invisibility, walking everywhere upon the earth.
	There is a maiden, Justice, born of Zeus, celebrated and
	revered by the gods who dwell on Olympus, and whenever
	someone harms her by crookedly scorning her, she sits
	down at once beside her father Zeus, Cronus’ son, and proclaims
	the unjust mind of human beings, so that he will
	take vengeance upon the people for the wickedness of
	their kings, who think baneful thoughts and bend judgments
	to one side by pronouncing them crookedly. Bear
	this in mind, kings, and straighten your discourses, you
	gift-eaters, and put crooked judgments quite out of your
	minds. A man contrives evil for himself when he contrives
	evil for someone else, and an evil plan is most evil for the
	planner. Zeus’ eye, which sees all things and knows all
	things, perceives this too, if he so wishes, and he is well
	aware just what kind of justice this is which the city has
	within it. Right now I myself would not want to be a just
	man among human beings, neither I nor a son of mine,
	since it is evil for a man to be just if the more unjust one will
	receive greater justice. But I do not anticipate that the
	counsellor Zeus will let things end up this way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(274) Perses, lay these things in your heart and give
	heed to Justice, and put violence entirely out of your mind.
	This is the law that Cronus’ son has established for human
	beings: that fish and beasts and winged birds eat one another,

	since Justice is not among them; but to human beings
	he has given Justice, which is the best by far. For if
	someone who recognizes what is just is willing to speak
	it out publicly, then far-seeing Zeus gives him wealth.
	But whoever willfully swears a false oath, telling a lie in his
	testimony, he himself is incurably hurt at the same time as
	he harms Justice, and in after times his family is left more
	obscure; whereas the family of the man who keeps his oath
	is better in after times.

	(286) To you, Perses, you great fool, I will speak my fine
	thoughts: Misery is there to be grabbed in abundance, easily,
	for smooth is the road, and she lives very nearby; but in
	front of Excellence the immortal gods have set sweat, and
	the path to her is long and steep, and rough at first—yet

	(293) The man who thinks of everything by himself,
	considering what will be better, later and in the end—this
	man is the best of all. That man is fine too, the one who is
	persuaded by someone who speaks well. But whoever neither
	thinks by himself nor pays heed to what someone else
	says and lays it to his heart—that man is good for nothing.
	So, Perses, you of divine stock, keep working and always
	bear in mind our behest, so that Famine will hate you and
	well-garlanded reverend Demeter will love you and fill
	your granary with the means of life. For Famine is ever the

	feel resentment against that man, whoever lives without

	the labor of the bees, eating it without working. But as for
	you, be glad to organize your work properly, so that your
	granaries will be filled with the means of life in good season.
	It is from working that men have many sheep and are
	wealthy, and if you work you will be dearer by far to immortals
	and to mortals: for they very much hate men who
	do not work.
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] Work is not a disgrace at all, but not working
	is a disgrace. And if you work, the man who does not work
	will quickly envy you when you are rich; excellence and
	fame attend upon riches. Whatever sort you are by fortune,
	working is better, if you turn your foolish spirit away
	from other men’s possessions towards work, taking care for
	the means of life, as I bid you. Shame is not good at providing
	for a needy man—shame, which greatly harms men
	and also benefits them: for shame goes along with poverty,
	and self-confidence goes along with wealth.

	(320) Property is not to be snatched: god-given is better
	by far. For if someone grabs great wealth with his hands by
	violence, or plunders it by means of his tongue, as often
	happens when profit deceives the mind of human beings
	and Shamelessness drives Shame away, then the gods easily
	make him obscure, and they diminish that man’s household,

	cause a man grief: it is better for things to be at home, for
	what is outdoors is at risk. It is fine to take from what you
	have, but it is woe for the spirit to have need of what you do
	not have. I bid you take notice of this. For if you put down
	even a little upon a little and do this often, then this too will
	quickly become a lot; whoever adds to what is already
	there wards off fiery famine.
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] Take your fill when the storage-jar
	is just opened or nearly empty, be thrifty in the
	middle: thrift in the lees is worthless. Let the payment
	agreed for a man who is your friend be reliable; and smile
	upon your brother—but add a witness too: for both trust
	and distrust have destroyed men. Do not let a fancy-assed

	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c]Lines 361–63 discuss the accumulation of domestic stores
	and are out of place after 360, which concludes the advice to give
	to others rather than snatching from them; they fit much better after
	367, and so, against all the manuscripts, I have transposed
	them here. The traditional order may have arisen from the similarity
	between σμικρόν in line 360 and σμικρὸν ἐπὶ σμικρῷ in
	361.

	extra, nor measure out extra for you. Work, foolish Perses,
	at the works which the gods have marked out for human
	beings, lest someday, sorrowing in your spirit, together
	with your children and your wife you seek a livelihood
	among your neighbors, but they pay no attention to you.
	For two times maybe and three times you will succeed; but
	if you bother them again, you will accomplish nothing but
	will speak a lot in vain, and the rangeland of your words will
	be useless. I bid you take notice of how to clear your debts
	and how to ward off famine: a house first of all, a woman,
	and an ox for plowing—the woman one you purchase,
	not marry, one who can follow with the oxen—and arrange
	everything well in the house, lest you ask someone else and
	he refuse and you suffer want, and the season pass by, and
	the fruit of your work be diminished. Do not postpone until
	tomorrow and the next day: for the futilely working man
	does not fill his granary, nor does the postponer; industry
	fosters work, and the work-postponing man is always wrestling

	seven feet long: for this way things will fit together very
	well. If you cut a length eight feet long, you could cut a
	mallet-head from it too. Cut a three-span broad
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] quarter-wheel
	for a ten-palm sized
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c] cart. There are lots of bent
	timbers: search for one on the mountain or through the
	fields, and if you find one of holm-oak take it into your
	house as a plow-tree. For that wood stands up most
	strongly for plowing with oxen, when Athena’s servant has
	drawn it near and attached it to the yoke-pole after having
	fastened it with pegs to the plow-stock. Toil hard to lay
	up a pair of plows in your house, one of a single piece and
	one put together, since it is much better this way: if you
	broke one, you could set the other one upon your oxen.
	Yoke-poles of laurel or of elm are the least wormy, of oak
	the plow-stock, of holm-oak the plow-tree. Acquire two
	oxen, nine years old, male, that have reached the measure
	of puberty, for their strength has not been drained
	away yet: they are best at working. They will not break the
	plow by contending with one another in the furrow, leaving
	the work futile right there. Together with these, a strong
	forty-year-old man should follow with the plow, after he
	has breakfasted on a four-piece,
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] eight-part loaf, someone
	who puts care into his work and will drive a straight furrow,
	no longer gaping after his age-mates, but keeping his mind
	on his work. And another man, not a bit younger than
	him, is better for scattering the seeds and avoiding over-seeding:
	for a younger man is all aflutter for his age-mates.

	(479) If you plow the divine earth first at the winter
	solstice,
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c] you will harvest sitting down, covered in dust,
	grasping only a little with your hand and tying it together in
	opposite directions, not at all pleased, and you will carry it
	off in a basket; few will admire you. But the mind of aegis-holding
	Zeus is different at different times, and it is difficult
	for mortal men to know it. If you do plow late, this
	will be a remedy for you: when the cuckoo in the leaves of
	the oak tree first calls and gives pleasure to mortals on the
	boundless earth,
	[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c] if at that time Zeus rains on the third
	day without ceasing, neither exceeding the hoof-print of
	an ox nor falling short of it—in this way the late plower will
	vie with the early plower. Bear everything well in mind:
	mark well the bright spring when it comes, and the rain in
	good season.

	the earth and the forest bellow. It falls upon many lofty-leaved
	oaks and sturdy firs in the mountain’s dales and

	where once the Achaeans, waiting through the winter,
	gathered together a great host to sail from holy Greece to
	Troy with its beautiful women. There I myself crossed over
	into Chalcis for the games of valorous Amphidamas—that
	great-hearted man’s sons had announced and established
	many prizes—and there, I declare, I gained victory with a
	hymn, and carried off a tripod with handles. This I dedicated
	to the Heliconian Muses, where they first set me
	upon the path of clear-sounding song. This is as much experience
	of many-bolted ships as I have acquired; yet even
	so I shall speak forth the mind of aegis-holding Zeus, for
	the Muses taught me to sing an inconceivable hymn.

	(663) Sailing is in good season for mortals for around
	fifty days after the solstice,
	[c dimgray][sup]42[/sup][/c] when the summer goes to its
	end, during the toilsome season. You will not wreck your
	boat then nor will the sea drown your men—so long as Poseidon,
	the earth-shaker, or Zeus, king of the immortals,
	does not wish to destroy them: for in these gods is the
	fulfillment, both of good and of evil alike. That is when
	breezes are easy to distinguish and the sea is painless: at
	that time entrust your swift boat confidently to the winds,
	drag it down to the sea and put all your cargo into it. But
	make haste to sail back home again as quickly as possible,
	and do not wait for the new wine and the autumn rain and
	the approaching winter and the terrible blasts of Notus,
	which stirs up the sea, accompanying Zeus’ heavy autumn
	rain, and makes the sea difficult.

	sailing for human beings, in the spring-time: at that

	evil. And yet human beings do this too in the ignorance
	of their mind: for property is life for worthless mortals;
	yet it is a terrible thing to die among the waves. I bid
	you take notice of all these things in your spirit as I speak
	them out publicly: do not put all your means of life in hollow
	boats, but leave aside more, and load the lesser part:

	(706) Bear well in mind the retribution of the blessed
	immortals. Do not treat a comrade in the same way as your
	brother: but if you do, then do not harm him first, nor give
	him a lying grace with your tongue; but if he begins, telling
	you some word contrary to your spirit or even doing some
	such thing, then be mindful to pay him back twice as much.
	But if he is led once again towards friendship and decides

	and the most pleasure comes from a tongue that goes according

	the pleasure is the most and the expense is the least.

	do so after it sets, and before it rises, but even so do
	not completely bare yourself: for the nights belong to the
	blessed ones. And do not urinate while you are walking,
	on the road or off the road: it is crouching that the god-fearing
	man, who knows wisdom, does it, or after he has
	approached towards the wall of a well-fenced courtyard.
	And inside the house do not reveal your genitals besmirched
	with intercourse near the hearth, but avoid this.
	And do not sow offspring when you come home from an ill-spoken
	funeral, but from a dinner of the immortals. And
	do not ever urinate into the streams of rivers that flow
	down towards the sea nor onto fountains—avoid this entirely—and
	do not defecate into them: for that is not better.
	And do not cross on foot the fair-pouring water of ever-flowing
	rivers before you have prayed, looking into the
	beautiful stream, and washed your hands with lovely, clear
	water: whoever crosses a river, unwashed in evil and in his
	hands, against him the gods feel resentment, and they give
	him pains afterwards. And during the festival, the dinner
	of the gods, do not cut the dry from the living from the five-brancher

	sit upon it and croak. And do not take from undedicated

	[c dimgray][sup]46[/sup][/c] for that is not
	better—it makes a man unmanly—nor a twelve-month-old
	one: this too is established in the same way. And do not
	clean a man’s skin in a woman’s wash-water: for there is a
	dismal punishment upon this too, for a time. And do not
	carp destructively at burning sacrifices when you encounter
	them: for a god feels resentment against this too.

	(760) Act this way. Avoid the wretched talk of mortals.
	For talk is evil: it is light to raise up quite easily, but it is
	difficult to bear, and hard to put down. No talk is ever entirely
	gotten rid of, once many people talk it up: it too is

	(765) Bear well in mind the days that come from Zeus
	and point them out according to their portion to the slaves.
	The thirtieth of the month is the best for watching over the
	works and distributing the rations: people celebrate it because
	they distinguish the truth. These are the days that
	come from counsellor Zeus: to begin with, the first, the
	fourth, and the seventh, a holy day (for on this last, Leto
	gave birth to Apollo with his golden sword), and the eighth
	and the ninth. Two days of the waxing month are outstanding
	for toiling at a mortal’s works, the eleventh and the
	twelfth. Both of them are fine, for shearing sheep and for
	gathering together the gladdening wheat but the twelfth is
	much better than the eleventh. It is on that day that the

	(780) For beginning with the sowing, avoid the thirteenth
	day after the month begins; and yet it is the best one
	for getting your plants bedded in. The middle sixth day is
	very unfavorable for plants, but good for a man to be born;
	but it is not favorable for a maiden, neither to be born in
	the first place nor to get married. Nor is the first sixth day
	fitting for a maiden to be born, but it is a kind day for castrating
	kids and rams and for fencing in an enclosure for
	the flocks. And it is fine for a man to be born; such men are
	fond of speaking mockery and lies and guileful words and
	hidden whispers. On the eighth day of the month castrate a
	boar and a loud-bellowing bull, hard-working mules on the
	twelfth. On the great twentieth, in the fullness of the day, a
	wise man is born: his mind will be very sagacious. The
	tenth is fine for a man to be born, for a maiden the middle
	fourth: on that day place your hand upon sheep and rolling-footed
	curving-horned oxen and a jagged-toothed dog
	and hard-working mules, and tame them. Bear in mind to
	avoid the fourth day, both of the waning month and of the
	beginning one, spirit-devouring pains: this is a particularly
	authorized day. On the fourth day of the month lead a wife
	to your house, after you have distinguished the bird-omens
	that are the best for this kind of work. Avoid the fifth days,

	(805) On the middle seventh day inspect Demeter’s
	holy grain very well and winnow it on a well-rolled threshing-floor,
	and the woodcutter should cut boards for a bedchamber
	and many planks for a boat, ones which are well
	fitting for boats. On the fourth begin to build narrow boats.

	but the first ninth is entirely harmless for human beings: it
	is a fine day for both a man and a woman to be conceived
	and to be born, and never is that day entirely evil. Then
	again, few know that the thrice-ninth day is the best of the
	month for starting in on a storage-jar and for placing a yoke
	on the neck of oxen and mules and swift-footed horses, and
	for drawing a swift, many-benched boat down to the wine-dark
	sea—few call things truthfully. On the middle fourth,
	open a storage-jar—beyond all others it is a holy day. Then
	again, few know that the twenty-first is the best of the
	month at daybreak; towards evening it is worse.

	(822) These days are a great boon for those on the

	nothing. One man praises one kind of day, another an-other;
	but few are the ones who know. One time one of
	these days is a stepmother, another time a mother. Happy
	and blessed is he who knows all these things and does his
	work without giving offense to the immortals, distinguishing
	the birds and avoiding trespasses.

	Hesiod, together with his brother Perses, was born as son
	of Dius and Pycimede, who were from Aeolian Cyme, poor
	people who because of their lack of resources and their
	debts abandoned their native Cyme and emigrated to
	Ascra, a little town in Boeotia, bad in winter and evil in
	summer, lying at the foot of Mount Helicon, and they settled
	there. While the human beings were afflicted by such

	flocks on Helicon. They say that some women, nine of
	them, came and plucked twigs from the Heliconian laurel
	and fed him with them, and in this way he took his fill of
	wisdom and poetry. . . . Some say that he flourished at the

	for there the end of death is fated for you.
	So he fled from the Peloponnesian Nemea; but in Locrian

	their sister Ctimene, from whom Stesichorus was
	born. For Oenoe was called the temple of Nemean Zeus.
	Three days later his body was carried by dolphins to the
	shore between Locris and Euboea, and the Locrians buried
	him in Oenoan Nemea. His murderers boarded a ship
	and tried to flee, but they died in a storm. Later, according
	to an oracle, the Orchomenians transported Hesiod’s
	bones and buried them in the middle of the market-place,
	and they set up the following inscription:

	Regarding the age of Homer and of Hesiod there is no
	consensus. Some, including Philochorus and Xenophanes,
	have written that Homer was born before Hesiod; others,
	including the poet Lucius Accius and the historian Ephorus,
	that he was younger. But Varro says in book 1 of his
	[c dimgray]Portraits[/c] that it is not at all certain which of the two was
	born first but that there can be no doubt that they were
	both alive at the same time for a while, and that this is demonstrated
	by the epigram which is engraved on a tripod
	which is said to have been set up on Mount Helicon by
	Hesiod.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Accius, however, in book 1 of his [c dimgray]Didascalica[/c]
	makes use of quite feeble arguments which he supposes
	demonstrate that Hesiod was born first. “When Homer,”
	he said, “stated in the beginning of his poem that Achilles
	was Peleus’ son, he did not add who Peleus was”; but, he
	(i.e. Accius) says, “without a doubt he (i.e. Homer) would
	have said this if he had not seen that it had already been
	said by Hesiod (cf. [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 1006–7). In the same way,”
	he (i.e. Accius) said, “concerning the Cyclops he (i.e.
	Homer) would certainly not have omitted to indicate so remarkable
	a fact as that he was one-eyed, unless in the same
	way it had already been made well known by the poems of
	his predecessor Hesiod (cf. [c dimgray]Theogony[/c] 139–46).”

	and killed him, and together with him his attendant, whose

	and festival was taking place in Locris; they celebrate it
	publicly even now around that place. When the body was
	seen being carried to land, they ran to the shore, understandably

	which was still fresh, they made investigating the murder
	their first priority because of Hesiod’s fame. And they
	quickly succeeded in discovering the murderers, and cast
	them living into the sea and tore down their house. Hesiod
	was buried near the temple of Nemean Zeus. Most outsiders

	For we are told that the most renowned poets among the
	wise men of that time came together in Chalcis for the
	funeral of Amphidamas. . . . Since the poems which the poets
	had prepared made the decision difficult and irksome
	because they were of matching quality, and the renown of
	the contestants Homer and Hesiod made the judges feel
	helpless and embarrassed, they turned to riddles of the
	following sort, and Lesches, as they say, proposed the following:
	<q>
	Muse, tell me what has never happened earlier
	nor will ever come about later.</q>
	And Hesiod answered on the spot,
	<q>
	When around the tomb of Zeus the loud-footed
	horses
	make the chariots rub together, hastening for the
	victory.</q>
	And he is said to have been very much admired because of
	this and to have won the tripod.

	The Boeotians who live around Helicon say that of the poems

	but the [c dimgray]Works[/c]. And from this poem they remove the
	proem to the Muses, saying that it begins with the lines
	about the Strifes (i.e. line 11). And where the fountain is
	they showed me a lead tablet, very much damaged by the
	passage of time. On it was written the [c dimgray]Works[/c]. But there is
	another opinion, different from the first one, according
	to which Hesiod composed a very great number of epic
	poems: the poem about women; and what they call the
	[c dimgray]Great Ehoiai[/c]; [c dimgray]The Theogony[/c]; the poem about the seer
	Melampous; the one about Theseus’ descent into Hades
	together with Peirithous; and [c dimgray]The Precepts of Chiron[/c] (the
	ones for teaching Achilles); and everything that follows after
	the [c dimgray]Works and Days[/c]. These latter also say that Hesiod
	was taught the mantic art by the Acharnians; and in fact
	there is a poem on soothsaying, which we too have read,
	and explanations of prodigies.

	there in the following way. Because a pestilential disease
	had befallen both men and livestock, they sent envoys to
	the god; they say that the Pythia replied to them that they
	were to bring Hesiod’s bones from the region of Naupactus
	to that of Orchomenus, and that there was no other remedy
	for them. Then they asked a second time, where in the
	region of Naupactus they would find them; and the Pythia
	said that a crow would show them. And so, they say, when
	the emissaries were landing they saw a stone not far from
	the road, and the bird on the stone, and they found
	Hesiod’s bones in a hole in the rock. And an elegy was engraved

	fire, water, and air), like most men? For they say that all

	iv. Avery great difficulty has been neglected both by
	contemporary philosophers and by earlier ones, whether
	the principles of destructible things and of indestructible
	ones are the same or different. For if they are the same,
	how is it that some things are destructible and others indestructible,
	and for what reason? Hesiod and his followers
	and all the theologians only thought of what was plausible
	for themselves, and paid no attention to us. For when they
	establish that the principles are gods and are born from
	gods, they say that what does not taste nectar and ambrosia
	becomes mortal. It is clear that they are saying words that
	are intelligible for themselves, and yet what they have said
	about the actual application of these causes is beyond us.
	For if they (i.e. the gods) take hold of nectar and ambrosia
	for the sake of pleasure, then these are not at all the cause
	of their being; but if it is for the sake of being, how can they
	be eternal if they are in need of nourishment? But about
	mythic sophistries it is not worth inquiring seriously.

	what Chasm came to be out of, he will not be able to say.
	And some say that this was the reason that Epicurus decided

	he asked his teacher, who was reading out to him the line,
	“In truth, first of all Chasm came to be,” what Chasm came
	to be out of, if it came to be first. And when he (i.e. the

	Some think that the poet Hesiod was the father of the Platonic

	Earth, the ever immovable seat of all” ([c dimgray]Theogony[/c]
	116–17), and indestructible, because he has not asserted
	its dissolution and destruction. Aristotle thinks that Chasm
	is place, because before there can be body one must presuppose
	something that can receive it,[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c] and some of the
	Stoics think it is water, supposing that the name is derived
	from [c dimgray]chysis[/c] (“flowing”).[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c] But whichever it is, it is revealed
	most clearly by Hesiod that the world is generated. But a

	the holy Bible that the world is generated and indestructible

	and who could be like this except him who is beyond all
	things, him about whom and for the sake of whom all
	things exist? . . . But let us set aside the utterances of the
	poets: for, mixed in with what is divine, these contain very
	much of what is human too.

	If we say then to those who have achieved such visions that
	. . . and that the binding of Cronus[c dimgray][sup]41[/sup][/c] indicates the union of
	all creation with the intellectual and paternal transcendence
	of Cronus, that the castration of Sky (cf. [c dimgray]Theogony[/c]
	176–81) hints enigmatically at the separation of the Titanic
	chain from the world ordering that holds things together,
	then perhaps we would say what they already know and
	would restore the overly poetic and fictional aspect of the
	myths to the intellectual doctrine of the divine classes.

	discussing the poets, and especially the poetry of Hesiod

	(a) [c dimgray]On the Arrangement of Words[/c]

	Of the epic poets, it seems to me that it is Hesiod who has

	T125 Quintilian, [c dimgray]Institutions of Oratory[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Hesiod takes flight only rarely, and much of his work is
	filled with proper names, but his didactic maxims are useful,
	and the smoothness of his choice and arrangement of
	words can be recommended: he wins the palm in the middle
	style.

	Excellence of style in writings of this sort (i.e. genealogical

	in poetry, and one can recognize this better by
	comparing his poems with Orpheus’.

	Why should I (i.e. Cato) speak about the usefulness of manuring?
	I have spoken about that in the book I wrote on agriculture.
	On this subject the learned Hesiod did not even
	say a single word when he wrote about cultivation; but
	Homer, who lived many generations, as I believe, before
	(= T6), shows us Laertes trying to alleviate his longing for

	wrath, and he hastened as quickly as possible to fulfill the
	great deed that was Zeus’ established right for him. Together
	with him went the horse-smiting Boeotians, eager
	for war and battle, panting above their shields, and the
	close-fighting Locrians and the great-spirited Phocians;
	and Alcaeus’ good son commanded them, glorying in his
	army.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(27) But the father of men and of gods was weaving
	a different scheme in his spirit, to produce a protector
	against ruin for gods and for men who live on bread. He
	rushed from Olympus by night, planning deception in
	the depths of his spirit, desiring the love of a fine-girdled
	woman; he quickly reached Typhaonium, and from there
	the counsellor Zeus went up lofty Mount Phicion. Sitting
	there, he devised wondrous deeds in his spirit: for that very
	night he mingled with Electryon’s long–ankled daughter in
	her loving bed, and he fulfilled his desire. On that same
	night host-rousing Amphitryon, the splendid hero, arrived
	home after he had fulfilled the great deed; and he did not
	hasten to go to his slaves and countryside shepherds before
	he had gone up into his wife’s bed—such desire had seized
	the heart of the shepherd of the hosts. Just as when a man
	joyously escapes evil, from distressful illness or else from
	strong bondage, so too Amphitryon arrived home joyfully

	in the gifts of golden Aphrodite. And since she had
	been overpowered both by a god and by much the best

	For upon their massive limbs grew great strength and untouchable

	Amphitryon mightily offended the blessed immortals who
	possess Olympus, when he left Tiryns, the well-founded

	killed Electryon on account of broad-browed oxen. He
	came to Creon and to long-robed Henioche, who welcomed
	him and gave him all things fitting, which is justice
	for suppliants; and they honored him all the more in their
	hearts. And he lived exulting, together with Electryon’s
	fine-ankled daughter, his wife; and soon, as the years revolved,
	we were born, your father and I, alike neither in
	build nor in thought. But Zeus took away his mind from
	him: leaving behind his house and his parents, he went
	off—cruel one!—to pay honor to impious Eurystheus.
	Surely he often groaned afterwards, enduring his calamity:
	yet it cannot be made good again.

	strong though he is, he shall be satiated with war.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(101) Blameless Iolaus addressed him in turn: “Dear
	sir, in truth the father of men and of gods is doing you very
	great honor, and so too the bull-like Earth-Shaker,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] who
	possesses Thebes’ battlements and protects the city—such
	is this mortal too, strong and great, whom they are leading
	into your hands so that you can acquire fine glory. Come,
	put on war-like armor, so that we can wage battle, bringing
	Ares’ chariot and our own near one another as quickly
	as possible, since he will not frighten Zeus’s fearless son
	nor Iphicles’. No, I rather think that he will flee excellent
	Alcides’ two descendants,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] who are close to him, eager for
	war, to raise up battle—what is much dearer to them than a
	feast!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(115) So he spoke; and Heracles’ force smiled, rejoicing
	in his spirit, for what he had said pleased him greatly. Answering
	him he spoke winged words: “Hero Iolaus, nurtured
	by Zeus, the rough combat is no longer far off. Just as
	you were valorous earlier, so too keep turning now the
	great horse, black-maned Arion, in every direction, and
	help me however you can.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(122) He spoke thus and placed around his legs greaves
	of shining mountain-bronze, the famous gifts of Hephaestus.
	Second, he put around his chest a breast-plate, fine,
	golden, richly worked, which Pallas Athena, Zeus’ daughter,
	had given him when first he was about to set out on his

	(154) Upon it were wrought Pursuit and Rally; upon it
	burned Tumult and Murder and Slaughter; upon it was
	Strife, upon it rushed Battle-Din, upon it deadly Fate was
	dragging men by the feet through the battle, holding one
	who was alive but freshly wounded, another who was unwounded,
	another who had died. Around her shoulders
	she wore a cloak, purple with the blood of men, and she

	(161) Upon it were the heads of terrible snakes, unspeakable,
	twelve of them: they frightened the tribes of
	any men upon the earth who waged open war against
	Zeus’ son. There was a grinding of their teeth whenever
	Amphitryon’s son fought. They were burning, these marvelous
	works: spots like marks were visible to see on the
	terrible serpents, dark along their backs, and their jaws
	were black.

	(168) Upon it were herds of wild boars and of lions glaring
	at them, angry and eager. They were grouped in rows,
	and neither side was afraid but both made their neck hairs
	bristle. For a great lion was already lying between them,
	and around it were two boars, deprived of life, and their
	black blood was dripping down onto the ground; they were
	lying with their necks outstretched, dead, under the grim
	lions. Both sides were roused all the more to fight angrily,
	both the wild boars and the fierce-eyed lions.

	it measureless wealth was placed in the contest of the immortals. Goddesses were beginning the song, the Pierian Muses, and they looked as though they were singing piercingly.

	(207) Upon it was wrought a good-mooring harbor of
	the invincible sea, circular, made of fully purified tin, and it
	looked as though it were undulating; in the middle of it
	rushed many dolphins here and there, fishing, and they
	looked as though they were swimming. Two silver dolphins,
	spouting, were †…† the mute fish; below them, the

	Perseus, neither touching the shield with his feet nor

	the renowned Lame One had wrought him, made of gold.
	Around his feet he wore winged sandals; around his shoulders
	hung a black-bound sword from a bronze baldric. He
	flew like a thought. The head of a terrible monster, the
	Gorgon, covered his whole back; a pouch ran around it, a
	wonder to see, made of silver; shining tassels hung down
	from it, made of gold. The terrible helmet of Hades was set
	around the king’s temples and held the dread darkness of
	night. Perseus himself, Danae’s son, was outstretched, and
	he looked as though he were hastening and shuddering.

	The Gorgons, dreadful and unspeakable, were rushing after

	Clotho and Lachesis stood over them; Atropos, somewhat
	smaller, was there, not an especially big goddess, but nonetheless
	she was superior to these others and the oldest one.
	All of them were waging bitter battle around one man; they
	glared terribly with their eyes at one another in their fury,
	and upon it they were equal to one another in their claws
	and fierce hands. Beside them stood Death-Mist, gloomy
	and dread, pallid, parched, cowering in hunger, thickkneed;
	long claws were under her hands. From her nostrils
	flowed mucus, from her cheeks blood was dripping down

	The men were at pleasure, in revelries and choruses; some
	were leading a bride to her husband on a well-wheeled
	wagon, and a great wedding-song rose up. From afar rolled
	the blaze of burning torches in the hands of slaves, who
	walked in front, blooming in revelry, and performing choruses
	followed them. The men sent forth their voices from
	their soft mouths, accompanied by shrill panpipes, and
	around them spread the echo; while the women led the
	lovely chorus to the accompaniment of lyres. On the other
	side from there, young men were carousing, accompanied
	by a pipe, some performing in dance and song, while some
	walked in front, laughing each one with the pipe-player.

	(285) In front of the city, men were rushing mounted
	on horseback. Plowmen were breaking up the divine
	earth, and they were clothed in girt-up tunics. And there
	was a deep corn-field; with sharp tools some men were
	reaping the bending stalks which were weighed down with
	ears of corn, as though it were Demeter’s grain; others
	were tying the sheaves with bands, and these were falling
	onto the threshing-floor; others were harvesting the vines,
	holding sickles in their hands; others again were carrying
	white and black grape clusters from the gatherers to baskets,
	from big vine-rows weighed down with leaves and silver
	tendrils. Others again were carrying them to baskets.[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]
	Beside them was a vine-row made of gold, the famous
	work of exceedingly wise Hephaestus, \[others again, performing
	each one with a pipe-player\][c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] trembling with
	leaves and silver vine-props, weighed down with the
	grape-bunches; these were black. Some men were treading
	grapes, others were drawing off the juice.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(301) Other men were competing at boxing and wrestling.
	Others, huntsmen, were overtaking swift-footed
	hares, and there was a brace of jagged-toothed dogs in
	front, eager to catch them—while the others[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] were eager
	to escape. Beside them, horsemen were at hard toil:
	around a prize they were engaged in conflict and effort.

	Standing on the well-plaited chariots, the charioteers
	slacked the reins and urged the swift horses; the wellfastened
	chariots flew clattering and the naves of the
	wheels screeched loudly. They were at ceaseless toil, but
	they never achieved victory and the prize remained unawarded—set
	before them in the arena there was a large
	tripod too, made of gold, the famous work of exceedingly
	wise Hephaestus.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(314) Around the rim ran Ocean, and it looked as
	though it were in full flood; it held together the whole
	richly worked shield. Upon it were high-flying swans, calling
	loudly, and many were swimming on the surface of the
	water; beside them fish were being driven in rout—a wonder
	to see even for deep-thundering Zeus, through whose
	counsels Hephaestus had made the shield, big and massive,
	fitting it together with his skilled hands.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(320) Zeus’ strong son wielded it forcefully, and he
	leapt onto his horse-chariot, springing lightly, like the
	lightning of his father, aegis-holding Zeus. His charioteer,
	strong Iolaus, mounted the car and guided the curved
	chariot.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(325) The goddess, bright-eyed Athena, went up close
	to them and spoke winged words, encouraging them:
	“Hail, offspring of far-famed Lynceus! Now Zeus, who
	rules over the blessed ones, is giving you supremacy to slay
	Cycnus and to strip his famous armor. Something else I
	shall tell you, by far greatest of the hosts. When you have
	deprived Cycnus of sweet life, leave him and his armor

	(338) She spoke thus and went up eagerly into the chariot,
	revered among goddesses, holding victory and glory in
	her immortal hands. Then Zeus-born Iolaus called terrifyingly
	to the horses, and at his call they lightly bore the
	swift chariot, raising dust over the plain; for by shaking her

	go to the side of the road. I am driving past to Trachis, to

	to his daughter, dark-eyed Themistonoe. My fine fellow,

	They sprang down quickly onto the ground from their

	War-God; the charioteers drove the fine-maned horses
	nearby, and the broad earth rang out under their feet as

	upon one another, shouting loudly. The whole city of the

	came together with a prodigious war-cry, and counsellor

	(413) Then Cycnus, eager to kill the son of very strong
	Zeus, hurled his bronze spear at his shield, but the bronze
	did not shatter it: the gift of the god protected him. But
	Amphitryon’ son, Heracles’ force, quickly struck his unprotected

	and rolls down, bouncing mightily, and with an echo it goes
	eagerly along; but it encounters a lofty hill and dashes
	against it, and it is stopped there: so too chariot-weighting,
	dire Ares, shouting with a roar, rushed forward, while the
	other waited readily for him.

	(443) But Athena, the daughter of aegis-holding Zeus,
	came opposite Ares, holding the dark aegis; scowling terribly
	at him she spoke winged words: “Ares, restrain your
	mighty strength and your untouchable hands: for it is not
	right for you to kill Heracles, Zeus’ bold-hearted son, and
	strip his famous armor. Come then, cease from battle, and
	do not stand opposing me.”

	(450) So she spoke; yet she did not persuade Ares’
	great-hearted spirit, but shouting loudly and brandishing
	his weapons like fire he rushed swiftly upon Heracles’
	force, eager to strike him dead. And raging over his dead
	son he hurled his bronze spear hastily against the great
	shield. But bright-eyed Athena reached out from the chariot
	and turned aside the force of the spear. Bitter grief
	seized hold of Ares, and drawing his sharp sword he rushed
	upon strong-hearted Heracles. But Amphitryon’s son, insatiable
	for the terrible battle-cry, struck his unprotected
	thigh forcefully under the well worked shield; and guiding
	his spear he struck hard through the flesh and cast him
	down onto the ground between them. Fear and Rout
	quickly drove their well-running chariot and horses close
	to him, and they took him up from the broad-pathed earth

	themselves report in their histories that the pagans are
	called this from King Paganus, as the Greek poet Hesiod
	says; and later . . . they have maintained until now this false
	name which they cultivate, derived from King Paganus,
	the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha. And so “Hellen,” that is, a
	Greek man, is called this from the language and name of a
	king who was a son of Deucalion . . . and as Hesiod says, the
	Greeks received their name from a King Graecus
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c], who
	was a son of Deucalion named Graecus.

	Deucalion, during whose lifetime the flood took place, was
	the son of Prometheus; most authorities say his mother
	was Clymene, but Hesiod says it was Prynoe. . . . He married
	Pyrrha, the daughter of Epimetheus and Pandora, the
	one who was given to Epimetheus as wife in exchange for
	fire. And Deucalion had two daughters, Protogenea and
	Melanthea, and as sons Amphictyon and Hellen. Some say
	that Hellen was the son of Zeus by birth but was said to be
	the son of Deucalion. From Hellen was born Aeolus, the
	father of Cretheus, Athamas, Sisyphus.

	Thus Hesiod is more recent (i.e. than Homer), for he introduces

	[m1]\ [/m]

	51 Philodemus, [c dimgray]On Piety[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Hesiod \[says\] that, due to Zeus’ \[vengeance\], Schoeneus’
	\[daughter Atalanta\], who \[contrary to sacred law\] had seen
	\[what it is not lawful to see\], was turned
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] into a lioness.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	“Samus, the son of Halirrhothius”: some write “Samus the son
	of Halirrhothius” (i.e. at Pindar, [c dimgray]Olympian[/c] 10.70), whom
	Hesiod mentions:
	<q>
	But he \[scil. begot\] Semus and Alazygus, fine sons.</q>
	Semus was the son of Halirrhothius, the son of Perieres and
	Alcyone.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]In Philodemus’ text the verb is active but the subject is unstated;
	it may be Zeus who performs the metamorphosis (so
	Obbink, despite the ensuing grammatical awkwardness: cf. e.g.
	Pseudo-Apollodorus, [c dimgray]Library[/c] 3.9.2), or it might for example be
	Aphrodite and/or Cybele (cf. Ovid, [c dimgray]Metamorphoses[/c] 10.681–704)
	or some other divinity. To preserve the uncertainty I have translated
	the verb as a passive.

	Arsinoe, the Daughter of Leucippus,
	Another Son of Perieres, and Her Son:
	Asclepius (and His Son Machaon)
	[m1]\ [/m]

	53a, b
	[m1]\ [/m]
	(a) Scholium on Pindar’s [c dimgray]Pythians[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Some say that Asclepius was Arsinoe’s son, some that he was
	Coronis’. Asclepiades says that Arsinoe was the daughter of
	Perieres’ son Leucippus, and that from her and Apollo were
	born Asclepius and a daughter Eriopis:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	she bore in the halls Asclepius, leader of men,
	overpowered by Phoebus, and beautiful-haired
	Eriopis.
	and †of Arsinoe† similarly:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	Arsinoe, mingling with the son of Zeus and Leto,
	bore a son, Asclepius, excellent and strong.
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c]
	(b) Pausanias, [c dimgray]Description of Greece[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The third story (it seems to me) is the least true one, according
	to which Asclepius was the son of Leucippus’
	daughter Arsinoe. . . . This oracle makes it quite clear that
	Asclepius was not Arsinoe’s son, but that this version was
	invented by Hesiod or by one of the poets who interpolated
	the verses into Hesiod’s poems to ingratiate himself
	with the Messenians.

	he killed Leto’s grandson, stirring up Phoebus’ spirit.

	Mallus) puts a different one: “born from immortals, they
	were raised as speaking mortals.” For how can he say that
	the same characters are “like the gods” but in the catalogue
	of Leucippus’ daughters have them destroyed by Apollo?

	Clymene, the daughter of Minyas, the son of Poseidon and
	Euryanassa, the daughter of Hyperphas, married Phylacus,
	the son of Deion, and bore Iphiclus, her swift son. It
	is said that by virtue of his feet he rivaled the winds and
	ran over the cornstalks and because of the lightness of
	his speed did not break their tassels. Some say that she
	{Clymene} married Helius first, and bore him as son
	Phaethon. The story is in Hesiod.

	Erysichthon, the son of Triopas, cut down the grove of

	hunger, so that he never ceased from starvation. He had a
	daughter, Mestra, a sorceress, who could transform herself
	into every kind of animal, and her father used her as a way
	to deal with his hunger: for he would sell her every day, and
	from this he would feed himself; but she would change her
	shape again and would flee and go back to her father.
	Erysichthon was called Aethon, as Hesiod says, because of
	his hunger.

	While the Harpies were being pursued, one of them fell
	in the Peloponnesus into the river Tigres, which is now
	called Harpys from her; some call her Nicothoe, others
	Aellopous. The other one, called Ocypete, but as some
	say Ocythoe (but Hesiod calls her Ocypode), fled down
	the Propontis and arrived as far as the Echinades islands,
	which now are called the Strophades (“Turnings”) because
	of her.

	(a) The Plotae (“Floating”) islands were renamed the
	Strophades ... Hesiod too says that Zetes and his
	companions turned around and prayed to Zeus
	[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c]:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	there they prayed to Aeneius who rules on high.
	For Aenus is a mountain in Cephallenia where there is a
	temple of Aenesian Zeus. ... Apollonius says that the one
	who turned Zetes and his companions around was Iris, but
	Hesiod says it was Hermes. The Plotae islands lie in the
	Sicilian Sea.

	Atreus’ Son Pleisthenes and Aerope, and Their
	Sons, Including Agamemnon and Menelaus
	[m1]\ [/m]

	137a, b, c
	[m1]\ [/m]

	(a) Scholium on Homer’s [c dimgray]Iliad[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	According to Homer, Agamemnon was the son of Pelops’
	son Atreus, and his mother was Aerope; but according to
	Hesiod he was the son of Pleisthenes.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	(b) Tzetzes’ commentary on Homer’s [c dimgray]Iliad[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Agamemnon, and Menelaus likewise, are considered to be
	children of Atreus’ son Pleisthenes according to Hesiod
	and Aeschylus, but according to the poet (i.e. Homer)
	and everyone they were simply sons of Atreus himself. …
	According to Hesiod, Aeschylus, and some others, Pleisthenes
	was the son of Atreus and Aerope, and the children
	of Pleisthenes and Dias’ daughter Cleolla were Agamemnon,
	Menelaus, and Anaxibia. Because Pleisthenes died
	young, they were brought up by their grandfather Atreus,
	and so they are considered by many to be Atreids.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	(c) Scholium on Tzetzes’ commentary on Homer’s [c dimgray]Iliad[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	According to Homer, Agamemnon and Menelaus were
	the sons of Pelops’ son Atreus and of Aerope from Crete,
	Catreus’ daughter; according to Hesiod they were the
	sons of Pleisthenes, a hermaphrodite or lame, who wore
	women’s clothing.

	(Fr. 191a, b) and Laodice; and with Tyro too, when she was
	seized with desire for \[the Enipeus\] (Fr. 27–30), whence
	she “bore \[children”\] ([c dimgray]Od.[/c] 11.249), and with Polyboea and
	the mortal Gorgon (i.e. Medusa, [c dimgray]Theog.[/c] 277–79); … and
	that Apollo, leader of the Muses, was seized with desire
	for \[Macareus’\] daughter Euboea and \[begot\] Argeius,
	and having had sexual intercourse with her gave her
	name \[to the island\], that he begot Philammon from his
	brother’s (i.e Hermes’) beloved \[Philonis\] (Fr. 65.14–16),
	and \[Asclepius\] from Arsinoe (Fr. 53–54), that he did
	not \[overlook\] Acacallis who was Hermes’ lover, and was
	seized with desire for Cyrene (Fr. 158–59) \[and\] Aethusa

	“Argus”: This was one of the sons of Phrixus. Herodorus

	[m1]\ [/m]
	Among the Thebans there was a seer, Teiresias ... Hesiod says
	that after he saw snakes coupling on Mount Cyllene and injured
	them, he was changed from a man into a woman, and
	that he watched for the same snakes coupling again and was
	changed back into a man. For this reason, when Hera and
	Zeus were quarreling about whether the pleasure in sexual
	intercourse was greater for men or for women, they asked
	him. He said that if there are nineteen portions in sexual intercourse,
	men take pleasure in nine of them, women in ten.
	Hence Hera blinded him, but Zeus gave him the gift of prophecy.
	What was said by Teiresias to Zeus and Hera:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	in only one portion out of ten portions a man has
	delight,
	but the ten a woman fills out, delighting her senses.

	(i.e. Colophon). But near Clarus he encountered a seer
	greater than himself, Mopsus, the son of Teiresias’ daughter
	Manto, and he died of grief. Hesiod arranges the story more
	or less in this way: Calchas set Mopsus the following challenge:

	“Astonishment grips me in my spirit at how many figs
	this fig-tree holds, small though it is: could you tell

	And the other replied,

	“Ten thousand is the number, and the measure is a

	the daughters of Cercyon and Sinis; lawfully, that he married

	246 Scholium on Germanicus’ translation of Aratus’
	[c dimgray]Phenomena[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Aristomachus says that a certain Hyrieus from Thebes
	prayed to have a son. Zeus, Hermes, and Poseidon came
	to stay with him as his guests and ordered him to slay a
	sacrificial animal so that a son would be born. When the ox-hide
	had been stripped off, the gods urinated into it, and at
	Hermes’ command it was covered up with earth; and from
	this the man mentioned above was born, whom they called
	Orion.
