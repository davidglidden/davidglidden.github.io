	[b]Book I[/b]
	1. From my Grandfather Verus,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] a kindly disposition and sweetness of temper.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. From what I heard of my Father[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and my memory of him, modesty and manliness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. From my Mother, the fear of God, and generosity; and abstention not only from doing ill but even from the very thought of doing it; and furthermore to live the simple life,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] far removed from the habits of the rich.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. From my Grandfather’s Father,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] to dispense with attendance at public schools, and to enjoy good teachers at home,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] and to recognize that on such things money should be eagerly spent.

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]Died before 136. The grandfather of M. (§ 1) died aged nearly 90 in 138 (Capit. [c dimgray]Vit. Mar.[/c] vi. 1; [c dimgray]Vit, Pii[/c] iv. 2).

	7. From Rusticus,[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] to become aware of the fact that I needed amendment and training for my character; and not to be led aside into an argumentative sophistry; nor compose treatises on speculative subjects, or deliver little homilies,[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] or pose ostentatiously as the moral athlete or unselfish man; and to eschew rhetoric,[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] poetry, and fine language; and not to go

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The name has perhaps dropped out. Capit. [c dimgray]Vit. Pii[/c] x. 5 has an anecdote of the death of the [c dimgray]educator[/c] of Marcus, but Aristides in his funeral oration on Alexander of Cotiaeum calls the latter not only διδάσκαλος but τροφεὺς to Marcus and Verus (Jebb’s Ed. § 149). But he is mentioned below § 10.

	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Dio (71. 6, §2) calls M. φιλόπονος.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]A Diognetus taught M. painting (Capit. iv. 9).

	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]Undoubtedly refers to the Christians, see [c dimgray]Digest[/c] L. 13.1, § 3, and [c dimgray]cp.[/c] Justin, [c dimgray]Apol.[/c] ii. 6 of Rome itself. The Christians constantly boasted of their power to exorcize: Tert. [c dimgray]Apol.[/c] 23; Iren. ii. 6, § 2; Lact. v. 21.

From Apollonius,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] self-reliance and an unequivocal determination not to leave anything to chance; and to look to nothing else even for a moment save Reason alone; and to remain ever the same, in the throes of pain, on the loss of a child,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] during a lingering illness; and to see plainly from a living example that one and the same man can be very vehement and yet gentle: not to be impatient in instructing others; and to see in him a man who obviously counted as the least among his gifts his practical experience and facility in imparting philosophic truths; and to learn in accepting seeming favours from friends[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] not to give up our independence for such things nor take them callously as a matter of course.

From Alexander the Grammarian,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] not to be captious; nor in a carping spirit find fault with those who import into their conversation any expression which is barbarous or ungrammatical or mispronounced, but tactfully to bring in the very expression, that ought to have been used, by way of answer, or as it were in joint support of the assertion, or as a joint consideration of the thing itself and not of the language, or by some such graceful[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] reminder.

From Alexander the Platonist,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] not to say to anyone often or without necessity, nor write in a letter, [c dimgray]I am too busy[/c], nor in this fashion constantly plead urgent affairs as an excuse for evading the obligations entailed upon us by our relations towards those around us.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	13. From Catuxus,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] not to disregard a friend’s expostulation even when it is unreasonable, but to try to bring him back to his usual friendliness; and to speak with whole-hearted good-will of one’s teachers, as it is recorded that Domitius[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] did of Athenodotus; and to be genuinely fond of one’s children.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	14. From my ‘brother’ Severus,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] love of family, love of truth, love of justice, and (thanks to him!) to know Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion, Brutus; and the conception of a state with one law for all, based upon individual equality and freedom of speech, and of a sovranty which prizes above all things the liberty of the subject; and furthermore from him also to set a well-balanced and unvarying value on philosophy; and readiness to do others a kindness, and eager generosity, and optimism, and confidence in the love of friends; and perfect openness in the case of those that came in for his censure; and the absence of any need for his friends to surmise what he did or did not wish, so plain was it.

	15. From Maximus,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] self-mastery and stability of purpose; and cheeriness in sickness as well as in all other circumstances; and a character justly proportioned of sweetness and gravity; and to perform without grumbling the task that lies to one’s hand.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And the confidence of every one in him that what he said was also what he thought, and that what he did was done with no ill intent. And not to shew surprise, and not to be daunted; never to be hurried, or hold back, or be at a loss, or downcast, or smile a forced smile, or, again, be ill-tempered or suspicious.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And beneficence[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and placability and veracity; and to give the impression of a man who cannot deviate from the right way rather than of one who is kept in it[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]; and that no one could have thought himself looked down upon by him, or could go so far as to imagine himself a better man than he; and to keep pleasantry within due bounds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	16. From my Father,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] mildness, and an unshakable adherence to decisions deliberately come to; and no empty vanity in respect to so-called honours; and a love of work and thoroughness; and a readiness to hear any suggestions for the common good; and an inflexible determination to give every man his due; and to know by experience when is the time to insist and when to desist; and to suppress all passion for boys.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]Here Pius, his adoptive father, is meant, not as above (i. 2) his father Verus. For a first sketch of this eulogy of Pius see below vi. 30.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]It is not quite clear whether this means that Pius had put away this vice from himself or others, hut the active verb seems rather to favour the latter view. Capit. [c dimgray]Vit. Pii[/c] ii. 1, calls him [c dimgray]clarus moribua[/c] ([c dimgray]cp.[/c] also Aur. Vict. [c dimgray]de Caes.[/c] xv.), but Julian says he was σώφρων οὐ τὰ ἐς Ἀφροδίτην.

	And his restricting in his reign public acclamations and every sort of adulation; and his unsleeping attention to the needs of the empire, and his wise stewardship of its resources, and his patient tolerance of the censure that all this entailed; and his freedom from superstition with respect to the Gods and from hunting for popularity with respect to men by pandering to their desires or by courting the mob: yea his soberness in all things[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and stedfastness; and the absence in him of all vulgar tastes and any craze for novelty.

	Besides this also was his high appreciation of all true philosophers without any upbraiding of the others, and at the same time without any undue subservience to them; then again his easiness of access and his graciousness that yet had nothing fulsome about it; and his reasonable attention to his bodily requirements, not as one too fond of life, or vain of his outward appearance,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] nor yet as one who neglected it, but so as by his own carefulness to need but very seldom the skill of the leech or medicines and outward applications.

	But most of all a readiness to acknowledge without jealousy the claims of those who were endowed with any especial gift, such as eloquence or knowledge of law or ethics or any other subject, and to give them active support, that each might gain the honour to which his individual eminence entitled him; and his loyalty to constitutional precedent without any parade of the fact that it was according to precedent.

	Furthermore he was not prone to change or vacillation, but attached to the same places and the same things; and after his spasms of violent headache he would come back at once to his usual employments with renewed vigour; and his secrets were not many but very few and at very rare intervals, and then only political secrets; and he shewed good sense and moderation in his management of public spectacles, and in the construction of public works, and in congiaria[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and the like, as a man who

	He did not bathe at all hours; he did not build for the love of building; he gave no thought to his food, or to the texture and colour of his clothes, or the comeliness of his slaves. His robe came up from Lorium, his country-seat in the plains, and Lanuvium supplied his wants for the most part. Think of how he dealt with the customs’ officer at Tusculum when the latter apologized, and it was a type of his usual conduct.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There was nothing rude in him, nor yet overbearing or violent nor carried, as the phrase goes, “to the sweating state”; but everything was considered separately, as by a man of ample leisure, calmly, methodically, manfully, consistently. One might apply to him what is told of Socrates,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] that he was able to abstain from or enjoy those things that many are not strong enough to refrain from and too much inclined to enjoy. But to have the strength to persist in the one case and be abstemious in the other[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] is characteristic of a man who has a perfect and indomitable soul, as was seen in the illness of Maxim us.

	That I was subordinated to a ruler and a father capable of ridding me of all conceit, and of bringing me to recognize that it is possible to live in a Court and yet do without body-guards and gorgeous garments and linkmen and statues and the like pomp; and that it is in such a man’s power to reduce himself very nearly to the condition of a private individual and yet not on this account to be more paltry or more remiss in dealing with what the interests of the state require to be done in imperial fashion.

	That my body holds out so long in such a life as mine[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]; that I did not touch Benedicta or Theodotus, but that even afterwards, when I did give way to amatory passions, I was cured of them; that, though often offended with Rusticus, I never went so far as to do anything for which I should have been sorry; that my mother,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] though she was to die young, yet spent her last years with me.

	That as often as I had the inclination to help anyone, who was in pecuniary distress or needing any other assistance, I was never told that there was no money available for the purpose; and that I was never under any similar need of accepting help from another.

Belief in them was universal, and shared by the atheist Pliny, the sceptic Lucian, Aristides the devotee, Galen the scientist, Bio the historian and man of affairs. It is not unknown to Christians. Yet there have been found writers to gird at Marcus for his “superstitious” belief in dreams!

Say to thyself at daybreak:[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] I shall come across the busy-body, the thankless, the overbearing, the treacherous, the envious, the unneighbourly.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] All this has befallen them because they know not good from evil. But I, in that I have comprehended the nature of the Good that it is beautiful, and the nature of Evil that it is ugly, and the nature of the wrong-doer himself that it is akin to me, not as partaker of the same blood and seed but of intelligence and a morsel of the Divine, can neither be injured by any of them—for no one can involve me in what is debasing—nor can I be wroth with my kinsman and hate him. For we have come into being for co-operation, as have the feet, the hands, the eyelids, the rows of upper and lower teeth. Therefore to thwart one another is against Nature; and we do thwart one another by shewing resentment and aversion.

	5. Every hour make up thy mind sturdily as a Roman and a man to do what thou hast in hand with scrupulous and unaffected dignity and love of thy kind and independence and justice; and to give thyself rest from all other impressions. And thou wilt give thyself this, if thou dost execute every act of thy life as though it were thy last,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] divesting thyself of all aimlessness[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and all passionate antipathy to the convictions of reason, and all hypocrisy and self-love and dissatisfaction with thy allotted share. Thou seest how few are the things, by mastering which a man may lead a life of tranquillity and godlikeness; for the Gods also will ask no more from him who keeps these precepts.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	6. Wrong thyself,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] wrong thyself, O my Soul! But the time for honouring thyself will have gone by; for a man has but one life, and this for thee is well-nigh closed,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] and yet thou dost not hold thyself in reverence, but settest thy well-being in the souls of others.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. Do those things draw thee at all away, which befall thee from without? Make then leisure for thyself for the learning of some good thing more, and cease being carried aside hither and thither. But therewith must thou take heed of the other error. For they too are triflers, who by their activities have worn themselves out in life without even having an aim whereto they can direct every impulse, aye and even every thought.

	8. Not easily is a man found to be unhappy by reason of his not regarding what is going on in another man’s soul; but those who do not attend closely to the motions of their own souls must inevitably be unhappy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	9. This must always be borne in mind, what is the Nature of the whole Universe, and what mine, and how this stands in relation to that, being too what sort of a part of what sort of a whole; and that no one can prevent thee from doing and saying always what is in keeping with the Nature of which thou art a part.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	10. Theophrastus in his comparison of wrongdoings—for, speaking in a somewhat popular way, such comparison may be made—says in the true philosophical spirit that the offences which are due to lust are more heinous than those which are due to anger.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] For the man who is moved with anger seems to turn his back upon reason with some pain and unconscious compunction[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]; but he that does wrong from lust, being mastered by pleasure, seems in some sort to be more incontinent and more unmanly in his wrong-doing. Rightly then, and not unworthily of a philosopher, he said that the wrongdoing which is allied with pleasure calls for a severer condemnation than that which is allied with pain; and, speaking generally, that the one wrong-doer is more like a man, who, being sinned against first, has been driven by pain to be angry, while the other, being led by lust to do some act, has of his own motion been impelled to do evil.

	there are Gods, is nothing dreadful; for they would not involve thee in evil. But if indeed there are no Gods, or if they do not concern themselves with the affairs of men, what boots it for me to live in a Universe empty of Gods or empty of Providence? Nay, but there [c dimgray]are[/c] Gods, and they do concern themselves with human things;[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and they have put it wholly in man’s power not to fall into evils that are truly such. And had there been any evil in what lies beyond, for this too would they have made provision, that it should be in every man’s power not to fall into it. But how can that make a man’s life worse which does not make the man worse?[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] Yet the Nature of the Whole could not have been guilty of an oversight from ignorance or, while cognizant of these things, through lack of power to guard against or amend them; nor could it have gone so far amiss either from inability or unskilfulness, as to allow good and evil to fall without any discrimination alike upon the evil and the good. Still it is a fact that death and life, honour and dishonour, pain and pleasure, riches and penury, do among men one and all betide the Good and the Evil alike, being in themselves neither honourable nor shameful. Consequently they are neither good nor evil.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	12. How quickly all things vanish away, in the Universe their actual bodies, and the remembrance of them in Eternity, and of what character are all objects of sense, and particularly those that entice us with pleasure or terrify us with pain or are acclaimed by vanity—how worthless and despicable and unclean and ephemeral and dead!—this is for our faculty of intelligence to apprehend; as also what they really are whose conceptions and whose voices award

	renown; what it is to die, and that if a man look at death in itself, and with the analysis of reason strip it of its phantom terrors, no longer will he conceive it to be aught but a function of Nature,—but if a man be frightened by a function of Nature, he is childish; and this is not only Nature’s function but her welfare;—and how man is in touch with God and with what part of himself, and in what disposition of this portion of the man.

	13. Nothing can be more miserable than the man who goes through the whole round of things, and, as the poet[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] says, [c dimgray]pries into the things beneath the earth[/c], and would fain guess the thoughts in his neighbour’s heart, while having no conception that he needs but to associate himself with the divine egenius’ in his bosom,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and to serve it truly. And service of it is to keep it pure from passion and aimlessness and discontent with anything that proceeds from Gods or men. For that which proceeds from the Gods is worthy of reverence in that it is excellent; and that which proceeds from men, of love, in that they are akin, and, at times and in a manner,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] of compassion, in that they are ignorant of good and evil—a defect this no less than the loss of power to distinguish between white and black.

For the present time is of equal duration for all, while that which we lose is not ours;[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and consequently what is parted with is obviously a mere moment. No man can part with either the past or the future. For how can a man be deprived of what he does not possess? These two things, then, must needs be remembered: the one, that all things from time everlasting have been cast in the same mould and repeated cycle after cycle, and so it makes no difference whether a man see the same things recur through a hundred years or two hundred,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] or through eternity: the other, that the longest liver and he whose time to die comes soonest part with no more the one than the other. For it is but the present that a man can be deprived of, if, as is the fact, it is this alone that he has, and what he has not a man cannot part with.

Fourthly, when it assumes a mask, and in act or word is insincere or untruthful. Fifthly, when it directs some act or desire of its own towards no mark, and expends its energy on any thing whatever aimlessly and unadvisedly, whereas even the most trifling things should be done with reference to the end in view. Now the end for rational beings is to submit themselves to the reason and law of that archetypal city and polity[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]—the Universe.

Of the life of man the duration is but a point,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] its substance streaming away, its perception dim, the fabric of the entire body prone to decay, and the soul a vortex, and fortune incalculable, and fame uncertain. In a word all the things of the body are as a river, and the things of the soul as a dream and a vapour; and life is a warfare and a pilgrim’s sojourn, and fame after death is only forgetfulness. What then is it that can help us on our way? One thing and one alone—Philosophy; and this consists in keeping the divine ’ genius’ within pure[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] and unwronged, lord of all pleasures and pains, doing nothing aimlessly[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] or with deliberate falsehood and hypocrisy, independent of another’s action or inaction; and furthermore welcoming what happens and is allotted, as issuing from the same source, whatever it be, from which the man himself has issued; and above all waiting for death with a good grace as being but a setting free of the elements of which every thing living is made up. But if there

	1. We ought not to think only upon the fact that our life each day is waning away, what is left of it being ever less, but this also should be a subject for thought, that even if life be prolonged, yet is it uncertain whether the mind will remain equally fitted in the future for the understanding of facts and for that contemplation which strains after the knowledge of things divine and human. For if a man has entered upon his dotage, there will still be his the power of breathing,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and digestion, and thought, and desire, and all such-like faculties; but the full use of himself,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] the accurate appreciation of the items[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] of duty, the nice discrimination of what presents itself to the senses, and a clear judgment on the question whether it is time for him to end his own life,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] and all such decisions, as above all require well-trained powers of reasoning—these are already flickering out in him.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] It needs, then, that we should press onwards, not only because

	we come each moment nearer to death, but also because our insight into facts and our close touch of them is gradually ceasing even before we die.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Such things as this also we ought to note with care, that the accessories too of natural operations have a charm and attractiveness of their own. For instance, when bread is in the baking, some of the parts split open, and these very fissures, though in a sense thwarting the bread-maker’s design, have an appropriateness of their own and in a peculiar way stimulate the desire for food. Again when figs are at their ripest, they gape open; and in olives that are ready to fall their very approach to over-ripeness gives a peculiar beauty to the fruit. And the full ears of corn bending downwards, and the lion’s beetling brows, and the foam dripping from the jaws of the wild-boar,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and many other things, though, if looked at apart from their setting, they are far from being comely, yet, as resultants from the operations of Nature, lend them an added charm and entice our admiration.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And so, if a man has sensibility and a deeper insight into the workings of the Universe, scarcely anything, though it exist only as a secondary consequence to something else, but will seem to him to form in its own peculiar way a pleasing adjunct to the whole. And he will look on the actual gaping jaws[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] of wild beasts[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] with no less pleasure than the representations of them by limners and modellers; and he will be able to see in the aged of either sex a mature prime and comely ripeness, and gaze with chaste eyes

	For it is only the things which relate to himself that he brings within the scope of his activities, and he never ceases to ponder over what is being spun for him as his share in the fabric of the Universe, and he sees to it that the former are worthy, and is assured that the latter is good. For the fate which is allotted to each man is swept along with him in the Universe as well as sweeps him along with it.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And he bears in mind that all that is rational is akin, and that it is in man’s nature to care for all men, and that we should not embrace the opinion of all, but of those alone who live in conscious agreement with Nature. But what sort of men they, whose life is not after this pattern, are at home and abroad, by night and in the day, in what vices they wallow and with whom—of this he is ever mindful. Consequently he takes no account of praise from such men, who in fact cannot even win their own approval.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	5. Do that thou doest neither unwillingly nor selfishly nor without examination nor against the grain. Dress not thy thought in too fine a garb. Be not a man of superfluous words or superfluous deeds. Moreover let the god that is in thee[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] be lord of a living creature, that is manly, and of full age, and concerned with statecraft, and a Roman, and a ruler, who hath taken his post as one who awaits the signal of recall from life in all readiness, needing no oath nor any man as his voucher. Be thine the cheery face and independence of help[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] from without and independence of such ease as others can give. It needs then to stand, and not be set, upright.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]

	6. If indeed thou findest in the life of man a better thing than justice, than truth, than temperance, than manliness, and, in a word, than thy mind’s satisfaction with itself in things wherein it shews thee acting according to the true dictates of reason, and with destiny in what is allotted thee apart from thy choice—if, I say, thou seest anything better than this, turn to it with all thy soul and take thy fill of the best, as thou findest it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But if there appears nothing better than the very deity[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] enthroned in thee, which has brought into subjection to itself all individual desires, which scrutinizes the thoughts, and, in the words of Socrates, has withdrawn itself from all the enticements of the senses, and brought itself into subjection to the Gods, and cherishes a fellow-feeling for men—if thou findest everything else pettier and of less account than this, give place to nought else, to which if thou art but once plucked aside, and incline thereto, never more shalt thou be able without distraction to give paramount honour to that good which is thine own peculiar heritage. For it is not right that any extraneous thing at all, such as the praise of the many, or office, or wealth, or indulgence in pleasure, should avail against that good which is identical with reason and a civic spirit. All these things, even if they seem for a little to fit smoothly into our lives, on a sudden overpower us and sweep us away.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But do thou, I say, simply and freely choose the better and hold fast to it. [c dimgray]But that is the better which is to my interest[/c]. If it is to thy interest as a rational creature, hold that fast; but if as a mere animal, declare it boldly and maintain thy judgment without

Prize not anything as being to thine interest that shall ever force thee to break thy troth, to surrender thine honour, to hate, suspect, or curse anyone, to play the hypocrite, to lust after anything that needs walls and curtains,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] For he that has chosen before all else his own intelligence and good ‘genius,’ and to be a devotee of its supreme worth, does not strike a tragic attitude or whine, nor will he ask for either a wilderness or a concourse of men; above all he will live neither chasing anything nor shunning it. And he recks not at all whether he is to have his soul overlaid with his body for a longer or a shorter span of time,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] for even if he must take his departure at once, he will go as willingly as if he were to discharge any other function that can be discharged with decency and orderliness, making sure through life of this one thing, that his thoughts should not in any case assume a character out of keeping with a rational and civic creature.

	With that it rests wholly that thy ruling Reason should never admit any opinion out of harmony with Nature, and with the constitution of a rational creature. This ensures due deliberation and fellowship with mankind and fealty to the Gods.

	10. Jettison everything else, then, and lay hold of these things only, few as they are; and remember withal that it is only this present,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] a moment of time, that a man lives: all the rest either has been lived or may never be. Little indeed, then, is a man’s life, and little the nook of earth[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] whereon he lives, and little even the longest after-fame, and that too handed on through a succession of manikins, each one of them very soon to be dead, with no knowledge even of themselves, let alone of a man who has died long since.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	For nothing is so conducive to greatness of mind as the ability to examine systematically and honestly everything that meets us in life, and to regard these things always in such a way as to form a conception of the kind of Universe they belong to, and of the use which the thing in question subserves in it; what value it has for the whole Universe and what for man, citizen as he is of the highest state, of which all other states are but as households; what it actually is, and compounded

	16. [c dimgray]Body, Soul, Intelligence[/c]: for the body sensations, for the soul desires, for the intelligence axioms. To receive impressions by way of the senses is not denied even to cattle; to be as puppets[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] pulled by the strings of desire is common to wild beasts and to pathics and to a Phalaris and a Nero. Yet to have the intelligence a guide to what they deem their duty is an attribute of those also who do not believe in Gods and those who fail their country in its need and those who do their deeds behind closed doors.[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]

But if all men disbelieve in his living a simple and modest and cheerful life, he is not wroth with any of them, nor swerves from the path which leads to his life’s goal, whither he must go pure, peaceful, ready for release, needing no force to bring him into accord with his lot.

	οὕτως ἕστηκε πρὸς τὰ συμβαίνοντα, ὥστε ἀεὶ
	πρὸς τὸ δυνατὸν καὶ διδόμενον μετατίθεσθαι

	1. That which holds the mastery[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] within us, when it is in accordance with Nature, is so disposed towards what befalls, that it can always adapt itself with ease to what is possible and granted us. For it is wedded to no definite material, but, though in the pursuit of its high aims it works under reservations,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] yet it converts into material for itself any obstacle that it meets with, just as fire[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] when it gets the mastery of what is thrown in upon it. A little flame would have been stifled by it, but the blazing fire instantly assimilates what is cast upon it and, consuming it, leaps the higher in consequence.

	2. Take no act in hand aimlessly[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] or otherwise than in accordance with the true principles perfective of the art.

	3. Men seek out retreats for themselves in the country, by the seaside, on the mountains, and thou too art wont to long above all for such things.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] But all this is unphilosophical to the last degree, when thou canst at a moment’s notice retire into thyself.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] For nowhere can a man find a retreat more full of

Make use then of this retirement continually and regenerate thyself.

Recall the alternative: [c dimgray]Either Providence or Atoms![/c][c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and the abundant proofs there are that the Universe is as it were a state.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] But is it the affections of the body that shall still lay hold on thee?

	From now therefore bethink thee of the retreat into this little plot that is thyself. Above all distract not thyself, be not too eager, but be thine own master, and look upon life as a man, as a human being, as a citizen, as a mortal creature. But among the principles readiest to thine hand, upon which thou shalt pore, let there be these two. One, that objective things do not lay hold of the soul, but stand quiescent without; while disturbances are but the outcome of that opinion which is within us. A second, that all this visible world changes in a moment, and will be no more; and continually bethink thee to the changes of how many things thou hast already been a witness. ‘The Universe—mutation: Life—opinion.’[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	other single polity can the whole race of mankind be said to be fellow-members?—and from it, this common State, we get the intellectual, the rational, and the legal instinct, or whence do we get them? For just as the earthy part has been portioned off for me from some earth, and the watery from another element, and the aerial[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] from some source, and the hot and fiery from some source of its own—for nothing comes from the non-existent, any more than it disappears into nothingness—so also the intellect has undoubtedly come from somewhere.

	5. Death like birth is a secret of Nature—a combination of the same elements, a breaking up into the same—and not at all a thing in fact for any to be ashamed of,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] for it is not out of keeping with an intellectual creature or the reason of his equipment.

	6.

	10. Note that all that befalls befalleth justly. Keep close watch and thou wilt find this true, I do not say, as a matter of sequence merely but as a matter of justice also, and as would be expected from One whose dispensation is based on desert.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Keep close watch, then, as thou hast begun, and whatsoever thou doest, do it as only a good man should in the strictest sense of that word. In every sphere of activity safeguard this.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	11. Harbour no such opinions as he holds who does thee violence, or as he would have thee hold. See things in all their naked reality.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	12. Thou shouldest have these two readinesses always at hand; the one which prompts thee to do only what thy reason in its royal and law-making capacity shall suggest for the good of mankind; the other to change thy mind,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] if one be near to set thee right, and convert thee from some vain conceit. But this conversion should be the outcome of a persuasion in every case that the thing is just or to the common interest—and some such cause should be the only one—not because it is seemingly pleasant or popular.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	13. Hast thou reason? [c dimgray]I have[/c]. Why then not use it? For if this performs its part, what else[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] wouldest thou have?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	14. Thou hast subsisted as part of the Whole.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] Thou shalt vanish into that which begat thee, or rather thou shalt be taken again into its Seminal Reason[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] by a process of change.

	17. Behave not as though thou hadst ten thousand years to live. Thy doom hangs over thee. While thou livest, while thou mayest, become good.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	18. What richness of leisure doth he gain who has no eye for his neighbour’s words or deeds or thoughts,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] but only for his own doings, that they be just and righteous! Verily it is not for the good man to peer about into the blackness of another’s heart,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] but to ‘run straight for the goal with never a glance aside.’
	[m1]\ [/m]
	19. He whose heart flutters for after-fame[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] does not reflect that very soon every one of those who remember him, and he himself, will be dead, and their successors again after them, until at last the entire recollection of the man will be extinct, handed on as it is by links that flare up and are quenched. But put the case that those who are to remember are even immortal,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] and the remembrance immortal, what then is that to thee? To the dead man, I need scarcely say, the praise is nothing, but what is it to the living, except, indeed, in a subsidiary way?[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] For thou dost reject the bounty of nature unseasonably in the present, and clingest to what others shall say of thee hereafter.[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]iv. 19, 51; xi. 18, § 5. The Greek word covers the meanings [c dimgray]expediency, management[/c], or [c dimgray]means to an end[/c]. We use it in a sort of double sense in the expression [c dimgray]economy of truth[/c].
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]Marcus is perhaps finding real fault with himself for caring so much what people said of him; see Capit. xx. 5; xxix. 5. But the reading is doubtful.

	20. Everything, which has any sort of beauty of its own, is beautiful of itself, and looks no further than itself, not counting praise as part of itself. For indeed that which is praised is made neither better nor worse thereby. This is true also of the things that in common parlance are called beautiful, such as material things and works of art. Does, then, the truly beautiful need anything beyond? Nay, no more than law, than truth, than kindness, than modesty. Which of these owes its beauty to being praised, or loses it by being blamed? What! Does an emerald[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] forfeit its excellence by not being praised? Does gold, ivory, purple, a lyre, a poniard, a floweret, a shrub?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	21. If souls outlive their bodies, how does the air contain them[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] from times beyond ken? How does the earth contain the bodies of those who have been buried in it for such endless ages? For just as on earth the change of these bodies, after continuance for a certain indefinite time, followed by dissolution, makes room for other dead bodies, so souls, when transferred into the air, after lasting for a certain time,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] suffer change and are diffused and become fire, being taken again into the Seminal Reason of the Whole, and so allow room for those that subsequently take up their abode there. This would be the answer one would give on the assumption that souls outlive their bodies.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But not only must the multitude of bodies thus constantly being buried be taken into account, but also that of the creatures devoured daily by ourselves

For this brings the tranquillity which comes of doing few things no less than of doing them well. For nine-tenths of our words and deeds being unnecessary, if a man retrench there, he will have more abundant leisure and fret the less. Wherefore forget not on every occasion to ask thyself, [c dimgray]Is this one of the unnecessary things?[/c] But we must retrench not only actions but thoughts which are

	manner contemplate all the other records of past time and of entire nations, and see how many after all their high-strung efforts sank down so soon in death and were resolved into the elements. But above all must thou dwell in thought upon those whom thou hast thyself known, who, following after vanity, neglected to do the things that accorded with their own constitution and, cleaving steadfastly thereto, to be content with them. And here it is essential to remember that a due sense of value[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and proportion should regulate the care bestowed on every action. For thus wilt thou never give over in disgust, if thou busy not thyself beyond what is right with the lesser things.

So also the names of those much be-sung[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] heroes of old are in some sense obsolete, Camillus, Caeso, Volesus,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Dentatus, and a little later Scipio and Cato, then also Augustus, and then Hadrianus and Antoninus. For all things quickly fade away and become legendary, and soon absolute oblivion encairns them. And here I speak of those who made an extraordinary blaze in the world. For the rest, as soon as the breath is out of their bodies, it is, [c dimgray]Out of sight, out of mind[/c].[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] But what, when all is said, is even everlasting remembrance[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]? Wholly vanity. What then is it that calls for our devotion? This one thing: justice in thought, in act unselfishness and a tongue that cannot lie and a disposition ready to welcome all that befalls as unavoidable, as familiar,[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] as issuing from a like origin and fountain-head.

	47.

	Turn also to all, one after another, that come within thine own knowledge. One closed a friend’s eyes and was then himself laid out, and the friend who closed his,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] he too was laid out—and all this in a few short years. In a word, fail not to note how short-lived are all mortal things, and how paltry—yesterday a little mucus,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] to-morrow a mummy or burnt ash. Pass then through this tiny span of time in accordance with Nature, and come to thy journey’s end with a good grace, just as an olive falls when it is fully ripe, praising the earth that bare it and grateful to the tree that gave it growth.

For something of the kind could have befallen everyone, but everyone would not have remained unhurt in spite of it. Why then count that rather a misfortune than this a good fortune? And in any case dost thou reckon that a misfortune for a man which is not a miscarriage from his nature?

How are they better off than those who were cut off before their time? After all, they lie buried somewhere at last, Cadicianus, Fabius, Julianus, Lepidus, and any others like them, who after carrying many to their graves were at last carried to their own.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Small, in any point of view, is the difference[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] in length, and that too lived out to the dregs amid what great cares and with what sort of companions and in what kind of a body! Count it then of no consequence. For look at the yawning gulf of Time behind thee, and before thee at another Infinity to come.

	1. At daybreak,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] when loth to rise,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] have this thought ready in thy mind: [c dimgray]I am rising for a man’s work[/c]. Am I then still peevish that I am going to do that for which I was born and for the sake of which I came into the world? Or was I made for this, that I should nuzzle under the bed-clothes and keep myself warm? [c dimgray]But this is pleasanter[/c]. Hast thou been made then for pleasure? In a word, I ask thee, to be acted upon or to act? Consider each tiny plant, each little bird, the ant, the spider, the bee, how they go about their own work and do each his part for the building up of an orderly Universe. Dost [c dimgray]thou[/c] then refuse to do the work of a man? Dost thou not hasten to do what Nature bids thee. [c dimgray]But some rest, too, is necessary[/c]. I do not deny it. Howbeit Nature has set limits to this, and no less so to eating and drinking. Yet thou exceedest these limits and exceedest sufficiency. But in acts it is no longer so; [c dimgray]there[/c] thou comest short of the possibility.

	For thou lovest not thyself, else surely hadst thou loved thy nature also and to do her will. But others who love their own art wear themselves to a shadow with their labours over it, forgetting to wash or take food.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] But thou holdest thine own nature in less honour than the chaser of metal his art of chasing, than the dancer his dancing, than the miser his moneybags, than the popularity-hunter his little applause. And these, when they are exceptionally in earnest, are ready to forgo food and sleep, so that they forward the things in which they are interested. But dost thou deem the acts of a social being of less worth and less deserving of attention?

	2. How easy a thing it is to put away and blot out every impression[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] that is disturbing or alien, and to be at once in perfect peace.

	3. Deem no word or deed that is in accord with Nature to be unworthy of thee, and be not plucked aside by the consequent censure of others or what they say,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] but if a thing is good to do or say, judge not thyself unworthy of it. For those others have their own ruling Reason and follow their own bent. Do not thou turn thine eyes aside, but keep to the straight path, following thy own and the universal Nature; and the path of these twain is one.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]

	4. I fare forth through all that Nature wills until the day when I shall sink down and rest from my labours, breathing forth my last breath into the air whence I daily draw it in, and falling upon that earth, whence also my father gathered the seed, and my mother the blood, and my nurse the milk; whence

For, in the former case, [c dimgray]prescribed[/c] has some such meaning as this: He ordained this for so and so as conducive to his health; while in the latter what befalls each man has been ordained in some way as conducive to his destiny. For we say that things [c dimgray]fall to[/c] us, as the masons too say that the huge squared stones in walls and pyramids [c dimgray]fall into[/c] their places, adjusting themselves harmoniously to one another in a sort of structural unity. For, in fine, there is one harmony of all things, and just as from all bodies the Universe is made up into such a body as it is, so from all causes is Destiny made up into such a Cause. This is recognized by the most unthinking, for they say: [c dimgray]Fate brought this on him[/c]. So then this was brought on this man, and this prescribed for this man. Let us then accept our fate, as we accept the prescriptions of Aesculapius. And in fact in these, too, there are many
	“bitter pills,” but we welcome them in hope of health.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Take much the same view of the accomplishment and consummation of what Nature approves as of thy health, and so welcome whatever happens, should it even be somewhat distasteful, because it contributes to the health of the Universe and the well-faring and well-doing of Zeus himself. For he had not brought this on a man, unless it had brought welfare to the Whole. For take any nature thou wilt, it never brings upon that which is under its control anything that does not conduce to its interests.

And thou dost cut them off, as far as lies with thee, and bring them to an end, when thou murmurest.

	9. Do not feel qualms[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] or despondency or discomfiture if thou dost not invariably succeed in acting from right principles; but when thou art foiled,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] come back again to them, and rejoice if on the whole thy conduct is worthy of a man, and love the course to which thou returnest. Come not back to Philosophy as to a schoolmaster, but as the sore-eyed to their sponges and their white of egg,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] as this patient to his plaster and that to his fomentations. Thus wilt thou rest satisfied with Reason, yet make no parade of obeying her. And forget not that Philosophy wishes but what thy nature wishes, whereas thy wish was for something else that accords not with Nature. [c dimgray]Yes, for it would have been the acme of delight[/c]. Ah, is not that the very reason why pleasure trips us up? Nay, see if these be not more delightful still: high-mindedness, independence, simplicity, tenderness of heart,[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] sanctity of life. Why what is more delightful than wisdom herself,

	when thou thinkest how sure and smooth in all its workings is the faculty of understanding and knowledge?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	10. Things are in a sense so wrapped up in mystery that not a few philosophers, and they no ordinary ones, have concluded that they are wholly beyond our comprehension: nay, even the Stoics themselves find them hard to comprehend. Indeed every assent we give to the impressions of our senses is liable to error, for where is the man who never errs? Pass on then to the objective things themselves, how transitory they are, how worthless, the property, quite possibly, of a boy-minion, a harlot, or a brigand.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] After that turn to the characters of thine associates, even the most refined of whom it is difficult to put up with, let alone the fact that a man has enough to do to endure himself.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What then there can be amid such murk and nastiness, and in so ceaseless an ebbing of substance and of time, of movement and things moved, that deserves to be greatly valued or to excite our ambition in the least, I cannot even conceive. On the contrary, a man should take heart of grace to await his natural dissolution, and without any chafing at delay comfort[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] himself with these twin thoughts alone: the one, that nothing will befall me that is not in accord with the Nature of the Universe; the other, that it is in my power to do nothing contrary to the God and the ‘genius’[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] within me. For no one can force me to disobey that.

	11. [c dimgray]To what use then am I putting my soul?[/c] Never fail to ask thyself this question and to cross-examine

	12. What are counted as good things in the estimation of the many thou canst gather even from this. For if a man fix his mind upon certain things as really and unquestionably good, such as wisdom, temperance, justice, manliness, with this preconception in his mind he could no longer bear to listen to the poet’s, [c dimgray]By reason of his wealth of goods[/c]—; for it would not apply. But, if a man first fix his mind upon the things which appear good to the multitude, he will listen and readily accept as aptly added the quotation from the Comic Poet. In this way even the multitude have a perception of the difference. For otherwise this jest would not[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] offend and be repudiated, while we accept it as appropriately and wittily said of wealth and of the advantages which wait upon luxury and popularity. Go on, then, and ask whether we should prize and count as good those things, with which first fixed in our mind we might germanely quote of their possessor, that [c dimgray]for his very wealth of goods he has no place to ease himself in[/c].[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	as neither did it come into existence out of nothing. So shall my every part by change be told off[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] to form some part of the Universe, and that again be changed into another part of it, and so on to infinity.

	14. Reason and the art of reasoning are in themselves and in their own proper acts self-sufficing faculties. Starting from a principle peculiar to them, they journey on to the end set before them. Wherefore such actions are termed [c dimgray]right acts[/c], as signifying that they follow the right way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	15. Call none of those things a man’s that do not fall to him as man. They cannot be claimed of a man; man’s nature does not guarantee them; they are no consummations of that nature. Consequently neither is the end for which man lives placed in these things, nor yet that which is perfective of the end, namely The Good. Moreover, if any of these things did fall to a man, it would not fall to him to contemn them and set his face against them, nor would a man be commendable who shewed himself still lacking in these things, nor yet would he be a good man who came short of himself in any of them, if so be these things were good. But as it is, the more a man can cut himself free, or even be set free, from these and other such things with equanimity, by so much the more is he good.

And again: A thing is drawn towards that for the sake of which it has been made, and its end lies in that towards which it is drawn and, where its end lies, there lie also its interest and its good.

	20. In one respect a man is of very close concern to us, in so far as we must do him good and forbear; but in so far as any stand in the way of those acts which concern us closely, then man becomes for me as much one of things indifferent as the sun, as the wind, as a wild-beast. Though a man may in some sort fetter my activity, yet on my own initiative and mental attitude no fetters can be put because of the power they possess of conditional action[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and of adaptation to circumstances. For everything that stands in the way of its activity is adapted and transmuted by the mind into a furtherance of it,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] and that which is a check on this action is converted into a help to it, and that which is a hindrance in our path goes but to make it easier.

	23. Think often on the swiftness with which the things that exist and that are coming into existence are swept past us and carried out of sight. For all substance[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] is as a river in ceaseless flow,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] its activities ever changing and its causes subject to countless variations, and scarcely anything stable; and ever beside us is this infinity of the past and yawning abyss of the future, wherein all things are disappearing.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Is he not senseless who in such an environment puffs himself up, or is distracted, or frets as over a trouble lasting and far-reaching?

	[m1]\ [/m]
	25. Another does me some wrong? He shall see to it.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] His disposition is his own, his activities are his own. What the universal Nature wills me to have now, that I now have, and what my nature wills me now to do, that I do.

	26. Let the ruling and master Reason of thy soul be proof against any motions in the flesh smooth or rough. Let it not mingle itself with them, but isolate and restrict those tendencies to their true spheres. But when in virtue of that other sympathetic connection these tendencies grow up into the mind as is to be expected in a single organism, then must thou not go about to resist the sensation, natural as it is, but see that thy ruling Reason adds no opinion of its own as to whether such is good or bad.

What but to reverence the Gods and to praise them, to do good unto men and to [c dimgray]bear with them and forbear[/c],[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] but, for all else that comes within the compass of this poor flesh and breath, to remember that it is not thine nor under thy control?

	34. Thou hast it in thy power that the current of thy life be ever fair, if also ’tis thine to make fair way, if also in ordered way to think and act. The Soul of God and the souls of men and of every rational creature have these two characteristics in common: to suffer no let or hindrance from another, and to find their good in a condition and practice of justice, and to confine their propension to this.

	1. The Universal Substance is docile[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and ductile; and the Reason that controls it has no motive in itself to do wrong. For it hath no wrongness and doeth no wrong, nor is anything harmed by it. But all things come into being and fulfil their purpose as it directs.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	2. Make no difference in doing thy duty[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] whether thou art shivering or warm, drowsy[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] or sleep-satisfied, defamed or extolled, dying or anything else. For the act of dying too is one of the acts of life.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] So it is enough in this also to [c dimgray]get the work in hand done well[/c].[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Look within. Let not the special quality[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] or worth of anything escape thee.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	4. All objective things will anon be changed and either etherialized into the Universal Substance, if that indeed be one, or dispersed abroad.[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]

	6. The best way of avenging thyself is not to do likewise.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. Delight in this one thing and take thy rest therein—from social act to go on to social act, keeping all thy thoughts on God.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. The ruling Reason it is that can arouse and deflect itself, make itself whatever it will,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and invest everything that befalls with such a semblance as it wills.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	9. In accordance with the Nature of the Universe is accomplished each several thing. For surely this cannot be in accordance with any other nature, that either envelops it from without, or is enveloped by it within, or exists in external detachment outside it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	10. Either a medley and a tangled web[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and a dispersion abroad, or a unity and a plan and a Providence. If the former, why should I even wish to abide in such a random welter and chaos? Why care for anything else than to [c dimgray]turn again to the dust[/c] at last.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] Why be disquieted? For, do what I will, the dispersion must overtake me. But if the latter, I bow in reverence, my feet are on the rock, and I put my trust in the Power that rules.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	11. When forced, as it seems, by thine environment to be utterly disquieted, return with all speed into thy self, staying in discord no longer than thou must. By constant recurrence to the harmony,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] thou wilt gain more command over it.

	13. As in the case of meat and similar eatables the thought strikes us, this is the dead body of a fish, this of a fowl or pig; and again that this Falernian is merely the juice of a grape-cluster, and this purple-edged

For conceit is a past master in fallacies and, when thou flatterest thyself most that thou art engaged in worthy tasks, then art thou most of all deluded by it.

	vines, olives; and those which are admired by persons of a somewhat higher capacity may be classed as things which are held together by a conscious life, such as flocks and herds; and those which are admired by persons still more refined, as things held together by a rational soul; I do not mean rational as part of the Universal Reason, but in the sense of master of an art or expert in some other way, or merely in so far as to own a host of slaves. But he that prizes a soul which is rational, universal, and civic, no longer turns after anything else, but rather than everything besides keeps his own soul, in itself and in its activity, rational and social, and to this end works conjointly with all that is akin to him.

Fluxes and changes perpetually renew the world, just as the unbroken march of time makes ever new the infinity of ages. In this river of change,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] which of the things which swirl past him, whereon no firm foothold is possible, should a man prize so highly? As well fall in love with a sparrow[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] that flits past and in a moment is gone from our eyes. In fact a man’s life itself is but as an exhalation from blood[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and an inhalation from the air. For just as it is to draw in the air once into our lungs and give it back again, as we do every moment, so is it to give back thither, whence thou didst draw it first, thy faculty of breathing which thou didst receive at thy birth yesterday or the day before.

	16. Neither is it an inner respiration,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] such as that of plants, that we should prize, nor the breathing which we have in common with cattle and wild animals, nor the impressions we receive through our senses, nor that we are pulled by our impulses like marionettes,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] nor our gregarious instincts, nor our need of nutriment; for that is on a par with the rejection of the waste products of our food.

	What then is to be prized? The clapping of hands? No. Then not the clapping of tongues either. For the acclamations of the multitude are but a clapping of tongues. So overboard goes that poor thing Fame also. What is left to be prized? This methinks: to limit our action or inaction to the needs of our own constitution, an end that all occupations and arts set before themselves. For the aim of every art is that the thing constituted should be adapted to the work for which it has been constituted. It is so with the vine-dresser who looks after the vines, the colt-trainer, and the keeper of the kennel. And this is the end which the care of children and the methods of teaching have in view. There then is the thing to be prized!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This once fairly made thine own, thou wilt not seek to gain for thyself any of the other things as well. Wilt thou not cease prizing many other things also? Then thou wilt neither be free nor sufficient unto thyself nor unmoved by passion. For thou must needs be full of envy and jealousy, be suspicious of those that can rob thee of such things, and scheme against those who possess what thou prizest. In fine, a man who needs any of those things cannot but be in complete turmoil, and in many cases find

	17. Up, down,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] round and round sweep the elements along. But the motion of virtue is in none of these ways. It is something more divine, and going forward on a mysterious path fares well upon its way.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	18. What a way to act! Men are chary of commending their contemporaries and associates, while they themselves set great store by the commendation of posterity, whom they have never seen or shall see. But this is next door to taking it amiss that thy predecessors also did not commend thee.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	19. Because thou findest a thing difficult for thyself to accomplish do not conceive it to be impracticable for others; but whatever is possible for a man and in keeping with his nature consider also attainable by. thyself.

	20. Suppose that a competitor in the ring has gashed us with his nails and butted us violently with his head, we do not protest or take it amiss or suspect our opponent in future of foul play. Still we do keep an eye on him, not indeed as an enemy, or from suspicion of him, but with good-humoured avoidance. Act much in the same way in all the other parts of life. Let us make many allowances for our fellow-athletes as it were. Avoidance is always possible, as I have said, without suspicion or hatred.

	22. I do my own duty; other things do not distract me. For they are either inanimate or irrational, or such as have gone astray and know not the road.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	23. Conduct thyself with magnanimity and freedom towards irrational creatures and, generally, towards circumstances and objective things, for thou hast reason and they have none. But men have reason, therefore treat them as fellow creatures. And in all cases call upon the Gods, and do not concern thyself with the question, [c dimgray]How long shall I do this?[/c] Three hours are enough so spent.

	24. Death reduced to the same condition Alexander the Macedonian and his muleteer, for either they were taken back into the same Seminal Reason[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] of the Universe or scattered alike into the atoms.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]

	thine? Wouldst thou not go on gently to enumerate each letter? So recollect that in life too every duty is the sum of separate items.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Of these thou must take heed, and carry through methodically what is set before thee, in no wise troubled or shewing counter-irritation against those who are irritated with thee.

	27. How intolerant it is not to permit men to cherish an impulse towards what is in their eyes congenial and advantageous! Yet in a sense thou withholdest from them the right to do this, when thou resentest their wrong-doing. For they are undoubtedly drawn to what they deem congenial and advantageous.

	Do all things as a disciple of Antoninus.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Think of his constancy in every act rationally undertaken, his invariable equability, his piety, his serenity of countenance, his sweetness of disposition, his contempt for the bubble of fame, and his zeal for getting a true grasp of affairs. How he would never on any account dismiss a thing until he had first thoroughly scrutinized and clearly conceived it; how he put up with those who found fault with him unfairly, finding no fault with them in return; how he was never in a hurry; how he gave no ear to slander,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and with what nicety he tested dispositions and acts; was no imputer of blame, and no craven, not a suspicious man, nor a sophist, what little sufficed him whether for lodging or bed, dress, food, or attendance; how fond he was of work, and how long-suffering; how he would remain the whole day at the same occupation,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] owing to his spare diet[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] not even requiring to relieve nature except at the customary time; and how loyal he was to his friends and always the same; and his forbearance towards those who openly opposed his views, and his pleasure when anyone pointed out something better[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]; and how god-fearing he was and yet not given to superstition.

	again, look at these realities as thou didst at those thy dreams.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	32. I consist of body and soul.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] To the body indeed all things are indifferent, for it cannot concern itself with them. But to the mind[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] only those things are indifferent which are not its own activities; and all those things that are its own activities are in its own power. Howbeit, of these it is only concerned with the present; for as to its activities in the past and the future, these two rank at once among things indifferent.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	33. For hand or foot to feel pain is no violation of nature, so long as the foot does its own appointed work, and the hand its own. Similarly pain for a man, as man, is no unnatural thing so long as he does a man’s appointed work. But, if not unnatural, then is it not an evil either.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	34. The pleasures of the brigand, the pathic, the parricide, the tyrant[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]—just think what they are!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	35. Dost thou not see how the mechanic craftsman, though to some extent willing to humour the non-expert, yet holds fast none the less to the principles of his handicraft, and cannot endure to depart from them. Is it not strange that the architect and the physician should hold the rationale of their respective arts in higher reverence than a man his own reason, which he has in common with the Gods?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	36. Asia, Europe, corners of the Universe: the whole Ocean a drop in the Universe: Athos but a little clod therein: all the present a point in Eternity:—everything on a tiny scale, so easily changed, so quickly vanished.

	All things come from that one source, from that ruling Reason of the Universe,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] either under a primary impulse from it or by way of consequence. And therefore the gape of the lion’s jaws[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and poison and all noxious things, such as thorns and mire, are but after-results of the grand and the beautiful. Look not then on these as alien to that which thou dost reverence, but turn thy thoughts to the one source of all things.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	37. He, who sees what now is, hath seen all that ever hath been from times everlasting, and that shall be to eternity[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]; for all things are of one lineage and one likeness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	38. Meditate often on the intimate union and mutual interdependence of all things in the Universe. For in a manner all things are mutually intertwined, and thus all things have a liking for one another. For these things are consequent one on another by reason of their contracting and expanding[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] motion, the sympathy[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] that breathes through them, and the unity of all substance.

	40. Every implement, tool, or vessel is well if it do the work for which it is made, and yet in their case the maker is not at hand. But in the things which owe their organic unity to Nature, the Power that made is within them and abides there. Wherefore also must thou reverence it the more, and

If thou regardest anything not in thine own choice as good or evil for thyself, it is inevitable that, on the incidence of such an evil or the miscarriage of such a good, thou shouldst upbraid the Gods,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] aye, and hate men as the actual or supposed cause of the one or the other; and in fact many are the wrongdoings we commit by setting a value on such things.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] But if we discriminate as good and evil only the things in our power, there is no occasion left for accusing the Gods[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] or taking the stand of an enemy towards men.

	42. We are all fellow-workers towards the fulfilment of one object, some of us knowingly and intelligently, others blindly; just as Heraclitus, I think, says that [c dimgray]even when they sleep men are workers[/c] and fellow-agents in all that goes on in the world.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] One is a co-agent in this, another in that, and in abundant measure also he that murmurs and seeks to hinder or disannul what occurs. For the Universe had need of such men also. It remains then for thee to decide with whom thou art ranging thyself.

	44. If the Gods have taken counsel about me and the things to befall me, doubtless they have taken good counsel. For it is not easy even to imagine a God without wisdom. And what motive could they have impelling them to do me evil? For what advantage could thereby accrue to them or to the Universe which is their special care? But if the Gods have taken no counsel for me individually, yet they have in any case done so for the interests of the Universe, and I am bound to welcome and make the best of[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] those things also that befall as a necessary corollary to those interests. But if so be they take counsel about nothing at all—an impious belief—in good sooth let us have no more of sacrifices and prayers and oaths, nor do any other of these things every one of which is a recognition of the Gods as if they were at our side and dwelling amongst us—but if so be, I say, they do not take counsel about any of our concerns, it is still in my power to take counsel about myself, and it is for me to consider my own interest.

But further careful observation will shew thee that, as a general rule, what is to the interest of one man is also to the interest of other men.

	and many another such, of man’s perishable and transitory life itself. About all these reflect that they have long since been in their graves. What terrible thing then is this for them? What pray for those whose very names are unknown? One thing on earth is worth much—to live out our lives in truth and justice, and in charity with liars and unjust men.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	48. When thou wouldst cheer thine heart, think upon the good qualities of thy associates[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]; as for instance, this one’s energy, that one’s modesty, the generosity of a third, and some other trait of a fourth. For nothing is so cheering as the images of the virtues mirrored in the characters of those who live with us, and presenting themselves in as great a throng as possible. Have these images then ever before thine eyes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	49. Thou art not aggrieved, art thou, at being so many pounds in weight and not three hundred? Then why be aggrieved if thou hast only so many years to live and no more? For as thou art contented with the amount of matter allotted thee, so be content also with the time.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	50. Try persuasion first, but even though men would say thee nay, act when the principles of justice so direct. Should any one however withstand thee by force, take refuge in being well-content and unhurt, and utilize the obstacle for the display of some other virtue. Recollect that the impulse thou hadst was conditioned[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] by circumstances,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and thine aim was not to do impossibilities. What then was it?

	8. Be not disquieted about the future. If thou must come thither, thou wilt come armed with the same reason which thou appliest now to the present.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	9. All things are mutually intertwined,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and the tie is sacred, and scarcely anything is alien the one to the other. For all things have been ranged side by side,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and together help to order one ordered Universe. For there is both one Universe, made up of all things, and one God immanent in all things, and one Substance, and one Law, one Reason common to all intelligent creatures,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and one Truth: if indeed there is also one perfecting of living creatures that have the same origin and share the same reason.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	10. A very little while and all that is material is lost to sight in the Substance of the Universe,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] a little while and all Cause is taken back into the Reason of the Universe, a little while and the remembrance of everything is encairned in Eternity.

	11. To the rational creature the same act is at once according to nature and according to reason.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	12. Upright, or made upright.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	13. The principle which obtains where limbs and body unite to form one organism, holds good also for rational things with their separate individualities, constituted as they are to work in conjunction. But the perception of this shall come more home to thee, if thou sayest to thyself, I am a [c dimgray]limb[/c] of the organized body of rational things. But if \[using the letter [c dimgray]R[/c]\] thou sayest thou art but a [c dimgray]part,[/c][c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] not yet dost thou love mankind from the heart, nor yet does well-doing delight thee for its own sake.[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] Thou

	14. Let any external thing, that will, be incident to whatever is able to feel this incidence. For that which feels can, if it please, complain.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] But I, if I do not consider what has befallen me to be an evil,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] am still unhurt.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	16. The ruling Reason is never the disturber of its own peace, never, for instance, hurries itself into lust. But if another can cause it fear or pain, let it do so. For it will not let its own assumptions lead it into such aberrations.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Let the body take thought for itself, if it may, that it suffer no hurt and, if it do so suffer, let it proclaim the fact.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] But the soul that has the faculty of fear, the faculty of pain, and alone can assume that these exist, can never suffer; for it is not given to making any such admission.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]

	O Imagination?[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] A vaunt, in God’s name, as thou earnest, for I desire thee not! But thou art come according to thine ancient wont. I bear thee no malice; only depart from me!

	18. Does a man shrink from change? Why, what can come into being save by change? What be nearer or dearer to the Nature of the Universe? Canst thou take a hot bath unless the wood for the furnace suffer a change? Couldst thou be fed, if thy food suffered no change, and can any of the needs of life be provided for apart from change? Seest thou not that a personal change is similar, and similarly necessary to the Nature of the Universe?

	19. Through the universal Substance as through a rushing torrent[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] all bodies pass on their way, united with the Whole in nature and activity, as our members are with one another.

	How many a Chrysippus,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] how many a Socrates, how many an Epictetus[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] hath Time already devoured! Whatsoever man thou hast to do with and whatsoever thing, let the same thought strike thee.

The Nature of the Whole out of the Substance of the Whole,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] as out of wax, moulds at one time a horse, and breaking up the mould kneads the material up again into a tree, then into a man, and then into something else; and every one of these subsists but for a moment.

An angry scowl on the face is beyond measure unnatural, and when it is often seen there, all comeliness begins at once to die away, and in the end is so utterly extinguished that it can never be rekindled at all.

	33.Of Pain: [c dimgray]When unbearable it destroys us, when lasting, it is bearable,[/c][c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and the mind safeguards its own calm by withdrawing itself, and the ruling Reason takes no hurt.

	34. Of Glory: Look at the minds of its votaries, their characteristics, ambitions, antipathies.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] Remember too that, as the sands of the sea drifting one upon the other bury the earlier deposits, so in life the earlier things are very soon hidden under what comes after.

	35. \[From Plato.\][c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] [c dimgray]Dost thou think that the life of man can seem any great matter to him who has true grandeur of soul and a comprehensive outlook on all Time and all Substance? “It cannot seem so,” said he. Will such a man then deem death a terrible thing?

But, my good sir, see whether nobility and goodness do not mean something other than to save and be saved; for surely a man worthy of the name must waive aside the question of the duration of life however extended, and must not cling basely to life, but leaving these things in the hands of God pin his faith to the women’s adage, ‘his destiny no man can flee,’ and thereafter consider in what way he may best live for such lime as he has to live.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	54. At all times and in all places it rests with thee both to be content with thy present lot as a worshipper of the Gods, and to deal righteously with thy present neighbours, and to labour lovingly at thy present thoughts, that nothing unverified should steal into them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	55. Look not about thee at the ruling Reason of others, but look with straight eyes at this, [c dimgray]To what is Nature guiding thee[/c]?—both the Nature of the Universe, by means of what befalls thee and thy nature by means of the acts thou hast to do. But everyone must do what follows from his own constitution; and all other things have been constituted for the sake of rational beings—just as in every other case the lower are for the sake of the higher[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]—but the rational for their own sake.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Social obligation then is the leading feature in the constitution of man and, coming second to it, an uncompromising resistance to bodily inclinations. For it is the privilege of a rational and intelligent motion to isolate itself, and never to be overcome by the motions of sense or desire; for either kind is animal-like. But the motion of the Intelligence claims ever to have the pre-eminence and never to be mastered by them. And rightly so, for it is its nature to put all those to its own use. Thirdly, the rational constitution is free from precipitancy and cannot be misled. Let the ruling Reason then, clinging to these characteristics, accomplish a straight course and then it comes into its own.

	57. Love only what befalls thee and is spun for thee by fate. For what can be more befitting for thee?

	58. In every contingency keep before thine eyes those who, when these same things befell them, were straightway aggrieved, estranged,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] rebellious. Where are they now? Nowhere! What then? Wouldst thou too be like them? Why not leave those alien deflections to what deflects and is deflected by them, and devote thyself wholly to the question how to turn these contingencies to the best advantage? For then wilt thou make a noble use of them, and they shall be thy raw material. Only in thought and will take heed to be beautiful to thyself in all that thou doest. And remember, in rejecting the one and using the other, that the thing which matters is the aim of the action.

But all this must be secured without conscious effort.

	64. Whenever thou art in pain, have this reflection ready, that this is nothing to be ashamed of, nor can it make worse the mind that holds the helm. For it cannot impair it in so far as it is rational or in so far as it is social. In most pains, however, call to thy rescue even Epicurus when he says that a pain is  never unbearable[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] or interminable, so that thou remember its limitations and add nothing to it in imagination.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] Recollect this too that many of our every-day discomforts are really pain in disguise, such as drowsiness,[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] a high temperature, want of appetite.

The Gods—and they are immortal—do not take it amiss that for a time so long they must inevitably and always put up with worthless men who are what they are and so many[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]; nay they even care for them in all manner of ways. But thou, though destined to die so soon, criest off, and that too though thou art one of the worthless ones thyself.

	that thou art no longer able to have lived thy life wholly, or even from thy youth up, as a philosopher. Thou canst clearly perceive, and many others can see it too, that thou art far from Philosophy. So then thy life is a chaos,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and no longer is it easy for thee to win the credit of being a philosopher; and the facts of thy life too war against it. If then thine eyes have verily seen where the truth lies, care no more what men shall think of thee, but be content if the rest of thy life, whether long or short, be lived as thy nature wills. Make sure then what that will is, and let nothing else draw thee aside. For past experience tells thee in how much thou hast gone astray, nor anywhere lighted upon the true life; no, not in the subtleties of logic,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] or in wealth or fame or enjoyment, or [c dimgray]anywhere.[/c] Where then is it to be found? In doing that which is the quest of man’s nature. How then shall a man do this? By having axioms as the source of his impulses and actions. What axioms? On the nature of Good and Evil, shewing that nothing is for a man’s good save what makes him just, temperate, manly, free; nor any

	3. What are Alexander and Gaius and Pompeius to Diogenes and Heraclitus[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and Socrates?

Secondly, look steadfastly at the thing, and see it as it is and, remembering withal that thou must be a good man, and what the Nature of man calls for, do this without swerving, and speak as seemeth to thee most just, only be it graciously, modestly, and without feigning.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	7. Every nature is content with itself when it speeds well on its way; and a rational nature speeds well on its way, when in its impressions it gives assent to nothing that is false or obscure, and directs its impulses towards none but social acts, and limits its inclinations and its aversions only to things that are in its power, and welcomes all that the Universal Nature allots it. For it is a part of that, as the nature of the leaf is of the plant-nature; with the difference however, that in the case of the plant the nature of the leaf is part of a nature void both of sentience and reason, and liable to be thwarted, while a man’s nature is part of a nature unthwartable and intelligent and just, if indeed it divides up equally and in due measure to every one his quotas of time, substance, cause, activity, circumstance. And consider, not whether thou shalt find one thing in every case equal to one thing, but whether, collectively, the whole of this equal to the aggregate of that.

	16. Remember that neither a change of mind nor a willingness to be set right by others[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] is inconsistent with true freedom of will. For thine alone is the active effort that effects its purpose in accordance with thy impulse and judgment, aye and thy intelligence also.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	17. If the choice rests with thee, why do the thing? if with another, whom dost thou blame? Atoms or Gods? To do either would be crazy folly. No one is to blame. For if thou canst, set the offender right. Failing that, at least set the thing itself right. If that too be impracticable, what purpose is served by imputing blame? For without a purpose nothing should be done.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	18. That which dies is not cast out of the Universe. As it remains here, it also suffers change here and is dissolved into its own constituents, which are the elements of the Universe and thy own. Yes, and they too suffer change and murmur not.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	19. Every thing, be it a horse, be it a vine, has come into being for some end. Why wonder? Helios himself will say: [c dimgray]I exist to do some work;[/c] and so of all the other Gods. For what then dost thou exist? For pleasure? Surely it is not to be thought of.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	20. Nature has included in its aim in every case the ceasing to be no less than the beginning and the duration, just as the man who tosses up his ball.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] But what good does the ball gain while tossed upwards, or harm as it comes down, or finally when it reaches the ground? Or what good accrues to the bubble while it coheres, or harm in its bursting? And the same holds good with the lamp-flame.

	26. It brings gladness to a man to do a man’s true work. And a man’s true work is to shew goodwill to his own kind, to disdain the motions of the senses, to diagnose specious impressions, to take a comprehensive view of the Nature of the Universe and all that is done at her bidding.

	28.

	34. Thou hast seen a hand cut off or a foot, or a head severed from the trunk, and lying at some distance from the rest of the body. Just so does the man treat himself, as far as he may, who wills not what befalls and severs himself from mankind or acts unsocially. Say thou hast been torn away in some sort from the unity of Nature; for by the law of thy birth thou wast a part; but now thou hast cut thyself off. Yet here comes in that exquisite provision, that thou canst return again to thy unity.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] To no other part has God granted this, to come together again, when once separated and cleft asunder. Aye, behold His goodness, wherewith He hath glorified man! For He hath let it rest with a man that he be never rent away from the Whole, and if he do rend himself away, to return again and grow on to the rest and take up his position again as part.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	35. Just as the Nature of rational things has given each rational being almost all his other powers, so also have we received this one from it; that, as this Nature moulds to its purpose whatever interference or opposition it meets, and gives it a place in the destined order of things, and makes it a part of itself, so also can the rational creature convert every hindrance into material for itself[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and utilize it for its own purposes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	36. Let not the mental picture of life as a whole confound thee. Fill not thy thoughts with what and how many ills may conceivably await thee, but in every present case ask thyself: [c dimgray]What is there in this experience so crushing, so insupportable[/c]? Thou wilt blush

	41. To the animal nature a thwarting of sense-perception
	is an evil, as is also to the same nature the thwarting of impulse. There is similarly some other thing that can thwart the constitution of plants and is an evil to them. Thus then the thwarting of intelligence is an evil to the intelligent nature. Transfer the application of all this to thyself. Does pain, does pleasure take hold of thee? The senses shall look to it. Wast thou impelled to a thing and wast thwarted? If thy impulse counts on an unconditional fulfilment, failure at once becomes an evil to thee as a rational creature. But accept the universal limitation, and thou hast so far received no hurt nor even been thwarted.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Indeed no one else is in a way to thwart the inner purposes of the mind. For it no fire can touch, nor steel, nor tyrant, nor obloquy,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] nor any thing soever: [c dimgray]a sphere[/c][c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] [c dimgray]once formed continues round and true.[/c]

And yet [c dimgray]they[/c] have space for the disposal of their fragments; while the Universal Nature has nothing outside herself; but the marvel of her craftsmanship is that, though she is limited to herself, she transmutes into her own substance all that within her seems to be perishing and decrepit and useless, and again from these very things produces other new ones; whereby she shews that she neither wants any substance outside herself nor needs a corner where she may cast her decaying matter.

There the ray comes to a standstill, neither slipping off nor sinking down. Such then should be the diffusion and circumfusion of the mind, never a diffusing away but extension, and it should never make a violent or uncontrollable impact against any obstacle it meets with, no, nor collapse, but stand firm and illuminate what receives it. For that which conducts it not on its way will deprive itself wilfully of its beams.

	1. Injustice is impiety. For in that the Nature of the Universe has fashioned rational creatures for the sake of one another[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] with a view to mutual benefit based upon worth, but by no means for harm, the transgressor of her will acts with obvious impiety against the most venerable of Deities.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And the liar too acts impiously with respect to the same Goddess. For the Nature of the Universe is the Nature of the things that are. And the things that are have an intimate connexion with all the things that have ever been. Moreover this Nature is named Truth, and is the primary cause of all that is true. The willing liar then is impious in so far as his deceit is a wrong-doing; and the unwilling liar too, for he is out of tune with the Nature of the Whole, and an element of disorder by being in conflict with the Nature of an orderly Universe; for he is in conflict who allows himself, as far as his conduct goes, to be carried into opposition to what is true. And whereas he had previously been endowed by nature with the means of distinguishing false from true, by neglecting to use them he has lost the power.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	Again he acts impiously who seeks after pleasure as a good thing and eschews pain as an evil. For

	such a man must inevitably find frequent fault with the Universal Nature[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] as unfair in its apportionments to the worthless and the worthy, since the worthless are often lapped in pleasures and possess the things that make for pleasure, while the worthy meet with pain and the things that make for pain. Moreover he that dreads pain will some day be in dread of something that must be in the world. And there we have impiety at once. And he that hunts after pleasures will not hold his hand from injustice. And this is palpable impiety.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But those, who are of one mind with Nature and would walk in her ways, must hold a neutral attitude[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] towards those things towards which the Universal Nature is neutral—for she would not be the Maker of both were she not neutral towards both. So he clearly acts with impiety who is not himself neutral towards pain and pleasure, death and life, good report and ill report, things which the Nature of the Universe treats with neutrality. And by the Universal Nature treating these with neutrality I mean that all things happen neutrally in a chain of sequence[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] to things that come into being and to their after products[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] by some primeval impulse of Providence,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] in accordance with which She was impelled by some primal impulse to this making of an ordered Universe, when She had conceived certain principles for all that was to be, and allocated the powers generative of substances and changes and successions such as we see.

	all dissimulation and luxury and arrogance; failing that, however, the ‘next best course’ is to breathe out his life when his gorge has risen at these things. Or is it thy choice to throw in thy lot with vice, and does not even thy taste of it yet persuade thee to fly from the pestilence? For the corruption of the mind is a pest far worse than any such miasma and vitiation of the air which we breathe around us. The latter is a pestilence for living creatures and affects their life, the former for human beings and affects their humanity.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. Despise not death,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] but welcome it, for Nature wills it like all else. For dissolution is but one of the processes of Nature,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] associated with thy life’s various seasons, such as to be young, to be old, to wax to our prime and to reach it, to grow teeth and beard and gray hairs, to beget, conceive and bring forth. A man then that has reasoned the matter out should not take up towards death the attitude of indifference, eagerness, or scorn, but await it as one of the processes of Nature.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Look for the hour when thy soul shall emerge from this its sheath, as now thou awaitest the moment when the child she carries shall come forth from thy wife’s womb.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But if thou desirest a commonplace solace too that will appeal to the heart, nothing will enable thee to meet death with equanimity better than to observe the environment thou art leaving and the sort of characters with whom thy soul shall no longer be

	9. All that share in a common element have an affinity for their own kind. The trend of all that is earthy is to earth; fluids all run together; it is the same with the aerial; so that only interposing obstacles and force can keep them apart. Fire indeed has a tendency to rise by reason of the elemental fire, but is so quick to be kindled in sympathy with all fire here below that every sort of matter, a whit drier than usual, is easily kindled owing to its having fewer constituents calculated to offer resistance to its kindling. So then all that shares in the Universal Intelligent Nature has as strong an affinity towards what is akin, aye even a stronger. For the measure of its superiority to all other things is the measure of its readiness to blend and coalesce with that which is akin to it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At any rate to begin with among irrational creatures we find swarms and herds and bird-colonies and, as it were, love-associations.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] For already at that stage there are souls, and the bond of affinity shews itself in the higher form to a degree of intensity not found in plants or stones or timber. But among rational creatures are found political communities and friendships and households and gatherings, and in wars treaties and armistices. But in things still higher a sort of unity in separation even exists, as in the stars. Thus the ascent to the higher form is able to effect a sympathetic connexion[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] even among things which are separate.

	See then what actually happens at the present time; for at the present time it is only the intelligent creatures that have forgotten their mutual affinity and attraction, and here alone there is no sign of like flowing to like. Yet flee as they will, they are nevertheless caught in the toils, for Nature will have her way. Watch closely and thou wilt see ’tis so.

	22. Speed to the ruling Reason of thyself, and of the Universe, and of thy neighbour: of thine own, that thou mayest make it just; of that of the Universe, that thou mayest therewithal remember of what thou art a part; of thy neighbour, that thou mayest learn whether it was ignorance with him or understanding, and reflect at the same time that it is akin to thee.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	23. As thou thyself art a part perfective of a civic organism, let also thine every act be a part perfective of civic life. Every act of thine then that has no relation direct or indirect to this social end, tears thy life asunder and destroys its unity, and creates a schism, just as in a commonwealth does the man who, as far as in him lies, stands aloof from such a concord of his fellows.

	24. Children’s squabbles and make-believe, and little souls bearing up corpses[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]—the Invocation of the Dead[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] might strike one as a more vivid reality!

	25. Go straight to that which makes a thing what it is, its formative cause,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] and, isolating it from the material, regard it so. Then mark off the utmost time for which the individual object so qualified is calculated to subsist.

	27. When men blame or hate thee or give utterance to some such feelings against thee, turn to their souls, enter into them, and see what sort of men they are. Thou wilt perceive that thou needest not be concerned as to what they think of thee. Yet must thou feel kindly towards them, for Nature made them dear to thee.

	28. The same, upwards, downwards,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] from cycle to cycle are the revolutions of the Universe. And either the Universal Mind feels an impulse to act in each separate case—and if this be so, accept its impulsion—or it felt this impulse[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] once for all, and all subsequent things follow by way of consequence; and what matters which it be, for if you like to put it so the world is all atoms \[or indivisible\].[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] But as to the Whole, if God—all is well; if haphazard—be not thou also haphazard.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]

	Presently the earth will cover us all. It too will anon be changed, and the resulting product will go on from change to change, and so for ever and ever.

	that busy themselves with civic matters and flatter themselves that they act therein as philosophers! Drivellers all! What then, O Man? Do what Nature asks of thee now. Make the effort if it be given thee to do so and look not about to see if any shall know it.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Dream not of Utopias, but be content if the least thing go forward, and count the outcome of the matter in hand as a small thing.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] For who can alter another’s conviction? Failing a change of conviction, we merely get men pretending to be persuaded and chafing like slaves under coercion. Go to now and tell me of Alexander and Philip and Demetrius of Phalerum. Whether they realized the will of Nature and schooled themselves thereto, is their concern. But if they played the tragedy-hero,
	no one has condemned me to copy them. Simple and modest is the work of Philosophy: lead me not astray into pomposity and pride.

Reflect too on the life lived long ago by other men, and the life that shall be lived after thee, and is now being lived in barbarous countries; and how many have never even heard thy name, and how many will very soon forget it, and how many who now perhaps acclaim, will very soon blame thee, and that neither memory nor fame nor anything else whatever is worth reckoning.

Thou wilt at once set thy feet in a large room by embracing the whole Universe in thy mind and including in thy purview time everlasting, and by observing the rapid change in every part of everything, and the shortness of the span between birth and dissolution, and that the yawning immensity before birth is only matched by the infinity after our dissolution.

Again, marble but nodules of earth, and gold and silver but dross, garments merely hair-tufts, and purple only blood. And so with everything else. The soul too another like thing and liable to change from this to that.

	37. Have done with this miserable way of life, this grumbling, this apism! Why fret? What is the novelty here? What amazes thee? The Cause? Look fairly at it. What then, the Material?

But if they have power, why not rather pray that they should give thee freedom from fear of any of these things and from lust for any of these things and from grief at any of these things \[rather\] than that they should grant this or refuse that. For obviously if they can assist men at all, they can assist them in this. But perhaps thou wilt say:[c dimgray]The Gods have put this in my power.[/c] Then is it not better to use what is in thy power like a free man than to concern thyself with what is not in thy power like a slave and an abject? And who told thee that the Gods do not co-operate with us[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] even in the things that are in our power? Begin at any rate with prayers for such things and thou wilt see. One prays: How may I lie with that woman![c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Thou: [c dimgray]How may I not lust to lie with her![/c]Another: [c dimgray]How may I be quit of that man![/c] Thou: [c dimgray]How may I not wish to be quit of him![/c] Another: [c dimgray]How may I not lose my little child![/c] Thou:

Have the same reflection ready for the rogue, the deceiver, or any other wrongdoer whatever. For the remembrance that this class of men cannot but exist will bring with it kindlier feelings towards individuals of the class. Right useful too is it to bethink thee at once of this: [c dimgray]What virtue has Nature given man as a foil to the wrong-doing in question?[/c] For as an antidote against the unfeeling man she has given gentleness,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and against another man some other resource.

	Where is the harm or the strangeness in the boor acting—like a boor? See whether thou art not thyself the more to blame in not expecting that he would act thus wrongly. For thy reason too could have given thee means for concluding that this would most likely be the case. Nevertheless all this is forgotten, and thou art surprised at his wrongdoing.

	But above all, when thou findest fault with a man for faithlessness and ingratitude,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] turn thy thoughts to thyself. For evidently the fault is thine own, whether thou hadst faith that a man with such a character would keep faith with thee, or if in bestowing a kindness thou didst not bestow it absolutely and as from the very doing of it having at once received the full complete fruit.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]

	For when thou hast done a kindness, what more wouldst thou have? Is not this enough that thou hast done something in accordance with thy nature? Seekest thou a recompense for it? As though the eye should claim a guerdon for seeing, or the feet for walking! For just as these latter were made for their special work, and by carrying this out according to their individual constitution they come fully into their own, so also man, formed as he is by nature for benefiting others, when he has acted as benefactor or as co-factor in any other way for the general weal, has done what he was constituted for, and has what is his.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]

	2. Observe what thy nature asks of thee, as one controlled by Nature alone, then do this and with a good grace, if thy nature as a living creature is not to be made worse thereby. Next must thou observe what thy nature as a living creature asks of thee. And this must thou wholly accept, if thy nature as a rational living creature be not made worse thereby. Now the rational is indisputably also the civic. Comply with these rules then and be not needlessly busy about anything.

All that befalls either so befalls as thou art fitted by nature to bear it or as thou art not fitted.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] If the former, take it not amiss, but bear it as thou art fitted to do. If the latter, take not that amiss either, for when it has destroyed thee, it will itself perish. Howbeit be assured that thou art fitted by nature to bear everything which it rests with thine own opinion about it to render bearable and tolerable, according as thou thinkest it thy interest or thy duty to do so.

	For bearing this in mind, as I am a part, I shall not be displeased with anything allotted me from the Whole. For what is advantageous to the whole can in no wise be injurious to the part[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] For the Whole contains nothing that is not advantageous to itself; and all natures have this in common, but the Universal Nature is endowed with the additional attribute of never being forced by any external cause to engender anything hurtful to itself.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As long then as I remember that I am a part of such a whole, I shall be well pleased with all that happens; and in so far as I am in intimate connexion with the parts that are akin to myself, I shall be guilty of no unsocial act, but I shall devote my attention rather to the parts that are akin to myself,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and direct every impulse of mine to the common interest and withhold it from the reverse of this. That being done, life must needs flow smoothly, as thou mayst see the life flow smoothly of a citizen who goes steadily on in a course of action beneficial to his fellow-citizens and cheerfully accepts whatever is assigned him by the State.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	7. The parts of the Whole—all that Nature has comprised in the Universe—must inevitably perish, taking “perish” to mean “be changed.” But if this process is by nature for them both evil and inevitable, the Whole could never do its work satisfactorily, its parts ever going as they do from change to change and being constituted to perish in diverse ways. Did Nature herself set her hand to bringing evil upon parts of herself and rendering them not only liable to fall into evil but of necessity fallen into it,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]

	or was she not aware that such was the case? Both alternatives are incredible.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But supposing that we even put Nature as an agent out of the question and explain that these things are “naturally” so, even then it would be absurd to assert that the parts of the whole are naturally subject to change, and at the same time to be astonished at a thing or take it amiss as though it befell contrary to nature, and that though things dissolve into the very constituents out of which they are composed. For either there is a scattering of the elements[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] out of which I have been built up, or a transmutation of the solid into the earthy and of the spiritual[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] into the aerial; so that these too are taken back into the Reason of the Universe, whether cycle by cycle it be consumed with fire[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] or renew itself by everlasting permutations.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Aye and so then do not be under the impression that the solid and the spiritual date from the moment of birth. For it was but yesterday or the day before that all this took in its increment from the food eaten and the air breathed. It is then this, that it took in, which changes, not the product of thy mother’s womb. But granted that thou art ever so closely bound up[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] with that by thy individuality, this, I take it, has no bearing upon the present argument.

	sympathetic of .heart, great of heart, take heed thou be not new-named. And if thou shouldst forfeit these titles, e’en make haste to get back to them. And bear in mind that [c dimgray]wise of heart[/c] was meant to signify for thee a discerning consideration of every object and a thoroughness of thought; [c dimgray]sympathetic of heart,[/c] a willing acceptance of all that the Universal Nature allots thee; [c dimgray]great of heart[/c] an uplifting of our mental part above the motions smooth or rough of the flesh, above the love of empty fame, the fear of death, and all other like things. Only keep thyself entitled to these appellations, not itching to receive them from others, and thou wilt be a new man and enter on a new life. For to be still such as thou hast been till now, and to submit to the rendings and defilements of such a life, is worthy of a man that shews beyond measure a dull senselessness and a clinging to life, and is on a level with the wild-beast fighters that are half-devoured in the arena, who, though a mass of wounds and gore, beg to be kept till the next day, only to be thrown again, torn as they are, to the same teeth and talons.

	Take ship then on these few attributions, and if thou canst abide therein, so abide as one who has migrated to some Isles of the Blest. But if thou feelest thyself adrift, and canst not win thy way, betake thyself with a good heart to some nook where thou shalt prevail, or even depart altogether from life,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] not in wrath but in simplicity, independence, and modesty, having at least done this

	11. Make thy own a scientific system of enquiry into the mutual change of all things, and pay diligent heed to this branch of study and exercise thyself in it For nothing is so conducive to greatness of mind. Let a man do this and he divests himself of his body and, realizing that he must almost at once relinquish all these things and depart from among men, he gives himself up wholly to just dealing in all his actions, and to the Universal Nature in all that befalls him. What others may say or think about him or do against him he does not even let enter his mind, being well satisfied with these two things—justice in all present acts and contentment with his present lot.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] And he gives up all engrossing cares and ambitions, and has no other wish than to achieve the straight course through the Law and, by achieving it, to be a follower of God.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	12. What need of surmise when it lies with thee to decide what should be done, and if thou canst see thy course, to take it with a good grace and not turn aside; but if thou canst not see it, to hold back and take counsel of the best counsellors; and if any other obstacles arise therein, to go forward as thy present means shall allow with careful deliberation holding to what is clearly just? For to succeed in this is the best thing of all, since in fact to fail in this would be the only failure.

	Leisurely without being lethargic and cheerful as well as composed shall he be who follows Reason in everything.

	good man, but let anyone that shall form any such an idea of thee be as one that maketh a lie. All this rests with thee. For who is there to hinder thee from being good and sincere[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]? Resolve then to live no longer if thou be not such.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] For neither doth Reason in that case insist that thou shouldest.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	33. Taking our ‘material’ into account, what can be said or done in the soundest way? Be it what it may, it rests with thee to do or say it. And let us have no pretence that thou art being hindered.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Never shalt thou cease murmuring until it be so with thee that the utilizing, in a manner consistent with the constitution of man, of the material presented to thee and cast in thy way shall be to thee what indulgence is to the sensual. For everything must be accounted enjoyment that it is in a man’s power to put into practice in accordance with his own nature; and it is everywhere in his power.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A cylinder we know has no power given it of individual motion everywhere, nor has fire or water or any other thing controlled by Nature or by an irrational soul. For the interposing and impeding obstacles are many. But Intelligence and Reason make their way through every impediment just as their nature or their will prompts them. Setting before thine eyes this ease wherewith the Reason can force its way through every obstacle, as fire upwards, as a stone downwards, as a cylinder down a slope,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] look for nothing beyond. For other hindrances either concern that veritable corpse, the body,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] or, apart from imagination and the surrender of Reason herself, cannot crush us or work any harm at all.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]

	Else indeed would their victim at once become bad.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In fact in the case of all other organisms, if any evil happen to any of them, the victim itself becomes the worse for it. But a man so circumstanced becomes, if I may so say, better and more praiseworthy by putting such contingencies to a right use.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] In fine, remember that nothing that harms not the city can harm him whom Nature has made a citizen[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]; nor yet does that harm a city which harms not law. But not one of the so-called mischances harms law. What does not harm law, then, does no harm to citizen or city.

And the sound hearing and smell should be equipped for all that is to be heard or smelled. And the sound digestion should act towards all nutriment as a mill towards the grist which it was formed to grind. So should the sound mind be ready for all that befalls.

	Howbeit go away with no less kindliness towards them on this account, but maintaining thy true characteristics be friendly and goodnatured and gracious; nor again as though wrenched apart, but rather should thy withdrawal from them be as that gentle slipping away of soul from body which we see when a man makes a peaceful end. For it was Nature that knit and kneaded thee with them, and now she parts the tie. I am parted as from kinsfolk, not dragged forcibly away, but going unresistingly. For this severance too is a process of Nature.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	37. In every act of another habituate thyself as far as may be to put to thyself the question: [c dimgray]What end has the man in view?[/c][c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] But begin with thyself, cross-examine thyself first.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	38. Bear in mind that what pulls the strings is that Hidden Thing within us: [c dimgray]that[/c] makes our speech, [c dimgray]that[/c] our life, [c dimgray]that,[/c] one may say, makes the man. Never in thy mental picture of it include the vessel that overlies it[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] nor these organs that are appurtenances thereof. They are like the workman’s adze, only differing from it in being naturally attached to the body. Since indeed, severed from the Cause that bids them move and bids them stay, these parts are as useless as is the shuttle of the weaver, the pen of the writer, and the whip of the charioteer.

	1. The properties of the Rational Soul are these; it sees itself, dissects itself, moulds itself to its own will,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] itself reaps its own fruits[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]—whereas the fruits of the vegetable kingdom and the corresponding produce of animals are reaped by others,—it wins to its own goal wherever the bounds of life be set. In dancing and acting and such-like arts, if any break occurs, the whole action is rendered imperfect; but the rational soul in every part and wheresoever taken[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] shews the work set before it fulfilled and all-sufficient for itself, so that it can say: [c dimgray]I have to the full what is my own[/c].
	[m1]\ [/m]
	More than this, it goeth about the whole Universe and the void surrounding it and traces its plan, and stretches forth into the infinitude of Time, and comprehends the cyclical Regeneration[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] of all things, and takes stock of it, and discerns that our children will see nothing fresh,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] just as our fathers too never saw anything more than we.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] So that in a manner the man of forty years, if he have a grain of sense, in view of this sameness has seen all that has been

	and shall be. Again a property of the Rational Soul is the love of our neighbour, and truthfulness, and modesty, and to prize nothing above itself[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]—a characteristic also of Law. In this way then the Reason that is right reason and the Reason that is justice are one.

	2. Thou wilt think but meanly of charming song and dance and the pancratium,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] if thou analyze the melodious utterance into its several notes and in the case of each ask thyself: [c dimgray]Has this the mastery over me?[/c] For thou wilt recoil from such a confession.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] So too with the dance, if thou do the like for each movement and posture. The same holds good of the pancratium. In fine, virtue and its sphere of action excepted, remember to turn to the component parts,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] and by analyzing them come to despise them. Bring the same practice to bear on the whole of life also.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	3. What a soul is that which is ready to be released from the body at any requisite moment, and be quenched[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] or dissipated or hold together! But the readiness must spring from a man’s inner judgment, and not be the result of mere opposition \[as is the case with the Christians\].[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] It must be associated with deliberation and dignity and, if others too are to be convinced, with nothing like stage-heroics.

	6. Originally tragedies were brought on to remind us of real events, and that such things naturally occur, and that on life’s greater stage you must not be vexed at things, which on the stage you find so attractive. For it is seen that these things must be gone through, and they too have to endure them, who cry [c dimgray]Ah, Kithaeron![/c][c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Aye, and the dramatic writers contain some serviceable sayings, for example this more especially:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray]Though both my sons and me the gods have spurned,[/c]
	[c dimgray]For this too there is reason;[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	and again:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray]It nought availeth to be wroth with things;[/c][c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]
	and this:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray]Our lives are reaped like the ripe ears of corn;[/c][c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]
	and how many more like them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And after Tragedy the old Comedy was put on the stage, exercising an educative freedom of speech, and by its very directness of utterance giving us no unserviceable warning against unbridled arrogance. In somewhat similar vein Diogenes[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] also took up this rôle. After this, consider for what purpose the Middle Comedy was introduced, and subsequently the New, which little by little degenerated into ingenious mimicry. For that some serviceable

	8. A branch cut off from its neighbour branch[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] cannot but be cut off from the whole plant. In the very same way a man severed from one man has fallen away from the fellowship of all men. Now a branch is cut off by others, but a man separates himself[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] from his neighbour by his own agency in hating him or turning his back upon him; and is unaware that he has thereby sundered himself from the whole civic community.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] But mark the gift of Zeus who established the law of fellowship. For it is in our power to grow again to the neighbour branch, and again become perfective of the whole. But such a schism constantly repeated makes it difficult for the seceding part to unite again and resume its former condition. And in general the branch that from the first has shared in the growth of the tree and lived with its life is not like that which has been cut off and afterwards grafted on to it, as the gardeners are apt to tell you. Be of one bush, but not of one mind.

	aside from sound action, so let them not wrest thee from a kindly attitude towards them[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]; but keep a watch over thyself in both directions alike, not only in steadfastness[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] of judgment and action but also in gentleness towards those who endeavour to stand in thy path or be in some other way a thorn in thy side. For in fact it is a sign of weakness to be wroth with them, no less than to shrink from action and be terrified into surrender. For they that do the one or the other are alike deserters of their post,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] the one as a coward, the other as estranged from a natural kinsman and friend.

	10. [c dimgray]‘Nature in no case cometh short of art.’[/c] For indeed the arts are copiers of various natures. If this be so, the most consummate and comprehensive Nature of all cannot be outdone by the inventive skill of art. And in every art the lower things are done for the sake of the higher[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]; and this must hold good of the Universal Nature also. Aye and thence is the origin of Justice, and in justice all the other virtues have their root,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] since justice will not be maintained if we either put a value on things indifferent, or are easily duped and prone to slip and prone to change.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	11. If therefore the things, the following after and eschewing of which disturb thee, come not to thee, but thou in a manner dost thyself seek them out, at all events keep thy judgment at rest about them and they will remain quiescent, and thou shalt not be seen following after or eschewing them.

	12. The soul is ‘a sphere truly shaped,’[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] when it neither projects itself towards anything outside nor shrinks together inwardly, neither expands nor contracts,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] but irradiates a light whereby it sees the reality of all things and the reality that is in itself.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	13. What if a man think scorn of me? That will be his affair. But it will be mine not to be found doing or saying anything worthy of scorn. What if he hate me? That will be his affair.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] But I will be kindly and goodnatured to everyone, and ready to shew even my enemy where he has seen amiss, not by way of rebuke[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] nor with a parade of forbearance, but genuinely and chivalrously like the famous Phocion,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] unless indeed he was speaking ironically. For such should be the inner springs of a man’s heart[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] that the Gods see him not wrathfully disposed at any thing or counting it a hardship. Why, what evil can happen to thee if thou thyself now doest what is congenial to thy nature, and welcomest what the Universal Nature now deems well-timed, thou who art a man intensely eager that what is for the common interest should by one means or another be brought about?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	14. Thinking scorn of one another, they yet fawn on one another, and eager to outdo their rivals they grovel one to another.

	15. How corrupt is the man, how counterfeit, who proclaims aloud: [c dimgray]I have elected to deal straightforwardly with thee![/c] Man, what art thou at? There is no need to give this out. The fact will instantly declare itself. It ought to be written on the fore-

	head. There is a ring in the voice that betrays it at once, it flashes out at once from the eyes, just as the loved one can read at a glance every secret in his lover’s looks. The simple and good man should in fact be like a man who has a strong smell about him, so that, as soon as ever he comes near, his neighbour is, will-he nill-he, aware of it. A calculated simplicity is a stiletto.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] There is nothing more hateful than the friendship of the wolf for the lamb. Eschew that above all things. The good man, the kindly, the genuine, betrays these characteristics in his eyes and there is no hiding it.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	16. Vested in the soul is the power of living ever the noblest of lives, let a man but be indifferent towards things indifferent. And he will be indifferent, if he examine every one of these things both in its component parts[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and as a whole, and bear in mind that none of them is the cause in us of any opinion about itself, nor obtrudes itself on us. [c dimgray]They[/c] remain quiescent,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] and it is we who father these judgments about them and as it were inscribe them on our minds, though it lies with us not to inscribe them and, if they chance to steal in undetected, to erase them at once.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] Bear in mind too that we shall have but a little while to attend to such things and presently life will be at an end. But why complain of the perversity of things? If they are as Nature wills, delight in them and let them be no hardship to thee. If they contravene Nature, seek then what is in accord with thy nature and speed towards that, even though it bring no fame.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] For it is pardonable for every man to seek his own good.

	17. Think whence each thing has come, of what it is built up,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] into what it changes, what it will be when changed, and that it cannot take any harm.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	18. [c dimgray]Firstly[/c]: Consider thy relation[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] to mankind and that we came into the world for the sake of one another[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]; and taking another point of view, that I have come into it to be set over men, as a ram over a flock or a bull over a herd.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] Start at the beginning from this premiss: If not atoms,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] then an all-controlling Nature. If the latter, then the lower are for the sake of the higher and the higher for one another.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Secondly[/c]: What sort of men they are at board and in bed and elsewhere.[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] Above all how they are the self-made slaves of their principles, and how they pride themselves on the very acts in question.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Thirdly[/c]: That if they are acting rightly in this, there is no call for us to be angry. If not rightly, it is obviously against their will and through ignorance.[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] For it is against his will that every soul is deprived, as of truth, so too of the power of dealing with each man as is his due. At any rate, such men resent being called unjust, unfeeling, avaricious, and in a word doers of wrong to their neighbours.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Fourthly[/c]: That thou too doest many a wrong thing thyself and art much as others are,[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] and if thou dost refrain from certain wrong-doings, yet hast thou a disposition inclinable thereto[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] even supposing that through cowardice or a regard for thy good name or some such base consideration thou dost not actually commit them.

	[c dimgray]Fifthly[/c]: That thou hast not even proved that they are doing wrong, for many things are done even ‘by way of policy.’[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] Speaking generally a man must know many things before he can pronounce an adequate opinion on the acts of another.

	[c dimgray]Sixthly[/c]: When thou art above measure angry or even out of patience, bethink thee that man’s life is momentary, and in a little while we shall all have been laid out.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Seventhly[/c]: That in reality it is not the acts men do that vex us—for they belong to the domain of [c dimgray]their[/c] ruling Reason—but the opinions we form of those acts.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Eradicate these, be ready to discard thy conclusion that the act in question is a calamity, and thine anger is at an end.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] How then eradicate these opinions? By realizing that no act of another debases us. For unless that alone which debases is an evil, thou too must perforce do many a wrong thing and become a brigand[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] or any sort of man.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Eighthly[/c]: Bethink thee how much more grievous are the consequences of our anger and vexation at such actions than are the acts themselves which arouse that anger and vexation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Ninthly[/c]: That kindness is irresistible,[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] be it but sincere and no mock smile or a mask assumed. For what can the most unconscionable of men do to thee, if thou persist in being kindly to him, and when a chance is given exhort him mildly and, at the very time when he is trying to do thee harm, quietly teach him a better way [c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] thus: [c dimgray]Nay, my child, we have been made for other things.

	 no wise harmed, but thou art harming thyself,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] my child. Shew him delicately and without any personal reference that this is so, and that even honey-bees do not act thus nor any creatures of gregarious instincts. But thou must do this not in irony[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] or by way of rebuke, but with kindly affection and without any bitterness at heart, not as from a master’s chair, nor yet to impress the bystanders, but as if he were indeed alone even though others are present.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Bethink thee then of these nine heads, taking them as a gift from the Muses, and begin at last to be a [c dimgray]man[/c] while life is thine. But beware of flattering[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] men no less than being angry with them.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] For both these are non-social and conducive of harm. In temptations to anger a precept ready to thy hand is this: to be wroth is not manly, but a mild and gentle disposition, as it is more human, so it is more masculine. Such a man, and not he who gives way to anger and discontent, is endowed with strength and sinews and manly courage. For the nearer such a mind attains to a passive calm,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] the nearer is the man to strength. As grief is a weakness, so also is anger. In both it is a case of a wound and a surrender.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But take if thou wilt as a tenth gift from Apollo, the Leader of the Muses, this, that to expect the bad not to do wrong is worthy of a madman; for that is to wish for impossibilities.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] But to acquiesce in their wronging others, while expecting them to refrain from wronging thee, is unfeeling and despotic.[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]

	19. Against four perversions of the ruling Reason thou shouldest above all keep unceasing watch, and, once detected, wholly abjure them,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] saying in each case to thyself: [c dimgray]This thought is not necessary[/c];[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] [c dimgray]this is destructive of human fellowship; this could be no genuine utterance from the heart[/c].—And not to speak from the heart, what is it but a contradiction in terms?—The fourth case is that of self-reproach,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] for that is an admission that the divine part of thee has been worsted by and acknowledges its inferiority to the body, the baser and mortal partner, and to its gross notions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	20. Thy soul and all the fiery part that is blended with thee, though by Nature ascensive, yet in submission to the system of the Universe are held fast here in thy compound personality. And the entire earthy part too in thee and the humid, although naturally descensive, are yet upraised and take up a station not their natural one. Thus indeed we find the elements also in subjection to the Whole and, when set anywhere, remaining there under constraint until the signal sound for their release again therefrom.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Is it not then a paradox that the intelligent part alone of thee should be rebellious and quarrel with its station? Yet is no constraint laid upon it but only so much as is in accordance with its nature. Howbeit
	it does not comply and takes a contrary course. For every motion towards acts of injustice and licentiousness, towards anger and grief and fear, but betokens one who cuts himself adrift from Nature, Aye

	1. All those things, which thou prayest to attain by a roundabout way, thou canst have at once if thou deny them not to thyself[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]; that is to say, if thou leave all the Past to itself and entrust the Future to Providence,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and but direct the Present in the way of piety and justice: piety, that thou mayest love thy lot, for Nature brought it to thee and thee to it; justice, that thou mayest speak the truth freely and without finesse, and have an eye to law and the due worth of things[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] in all that thou doest; and let nothing stand in thy way, not the wickedness of others, nor thine own opinion, nor what men say, nor even the sensations of the flesh that has grown around thee[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]; for the part affected will see to that.

	2. God sees the Ruling Parts of all men stripped of material vessels and husks and sloughs. For only with the Intellectual Part of Himself is He in touch with those emanations only which have welled forth and been drawn off from Himself into them. But if thou also wilt accustom thyself to do this, thou wilt free thyself from the most of thy distracting care.

	4. Often have I marvelled how each one of us loves himself above all men, yet sets less store by his own opinion of himself than by that of everyone else. At any rate, if a God or some wise teacher should come to a man and charge him to admit no thought or design into his mind that he could not utter aloud as soon as conceived,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] he could not endure this ordinance, for a single day. So it is clear that we pay more deference to the opinion our neighbours will have of us than to our own.

	5. How can the Gods, after disposing all things well and with good will towards men, ever have overlooked this one thing, that some of mankind, and they especially good men, who have had as it were the closest commerce with the Divine, and by devout conduct and acts of worship have been in the most intimate fellowship with it, should when once dead have no second existence but be wholly extinguished?[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] But if indeed this be haply so, doubt not that they would have ordained it otherwise, had it needed to be otherwise. For had it been just, it would also have been feasible, and had it been in conformity with Nature, Nature would have brought it about.

	Therefore from its not being so, if indeed it is not so, be assured that it ought not to have been so. For even thyself canst see that in this presumptuous enquiry of thine thou art reasoning with God.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] But we should not thus be arguing with the Gods were they not infinitely good and just. But in that case they could not have overlooked anything being wrongly and irrationally neglected in their thorough Ordering of the Universe.

	6. Practise that also wherein thou hast no expectation of success. For even the left hand, which for every other function is inefficient by reason of a want of practice, has yet a firmer grip of the bridle than the right. For it has had practice in this.

	7. Reflect on the condition of body and soul befitting a man when overtaken by death, on the shortness of life,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] on the yawning gulf[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] of the past and of the time to come, on the impotence of all matter.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	8. Look at the principles of causation stripped of their husks; at the objective of actions; at what pain is, what pleasure, what death, what fame. See who is to blame for a man’s inner unrest; how no one can be thwarted by another[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]; that nothing is but what thinking makes it.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]

	[m1]\ [/m]
	Note that he who would not have the wicked do wrong is as one who would not have the fig-tree secrete acrid juice[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] in its fruit, would not have babies cry, or the horse neigh, or have any other things be that must be. Why, what else can be expected from such a disposition? If then it chafes thee, cure the disposition.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	17. If not meet, do it not: if not true, say it not. For let thine impulse be in thy own power.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	18. Ever look to the whole of a thing, what exactly that is which produces the impression on thee, and unfold it, analyzing it into its causes, its matter, its objective,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and into its life-span within which it must needs cease to be.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	19. Become conscious at last that thou hast in thyself something better and more god-like than that which causes the bodily passions and turns thee into a mere marionette.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] What is my mind now occupied with[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]? Fear? Suspicion? Concupiscence[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]? Some other like thing?

	20. Firstly, eschew action that is aimless and has no objective. Secondly, take as the only goal of conduct what is to the common interest.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]

	21. Bethink thee that thou wilt very soon be no one and nowhere, and so with all that thou now seest and all who are now living. For by Nature’s law all things must change, be transformed, and perish, that other things may in their turn come into being.[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]

	23. Any single form of activity, be it what it may, ceasing in its own due season, suffers no ill because it hath ceased, nor does the agent suffer in that it hath ceased to act.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Similarly then if life, that sum total of all our acts, cease in its own good time, it suffers no ill from this very fact, nor is he in an ill plight who has brought this chain of acts to an end in its own due time. The due season and the terminus are fixed by Nature, at times even by our individual nature, as when in old age, but in any case by the Universal Nature, the constant change of whose parts keeps the whole Universe ever youthful[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] and in its prime. All that is advantageous to the Whole is ever fair and in its bloom. The ending of life then is not only no evil to the individual—for it brings him no disgrace,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] if in fact it be both outside our choice and not inimical to the general weal—but a good, since it is timely for the Universe, bears its share in it and is borne along with it.[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] For then is he, who is borne along on the same path as God, and borne in his judgment towards the same things, indeed a man god-borne.[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]

	24. Thou must have these three rules ready for use. [c dimgray]Firstly[/c], not to do anything, that thou doest, aimlessly,[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] or otherwise than as Justice herself would have acted; and to realize that all that befalls thee from without is due either to Chance or to Providence,

	29. Salvation in life depends on our seeing everything in its entirety and and its reality, in its Matter and its Cause[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]: on our doing what is just and speaking what is true with all our soul. What remains but to get delight of life by dovetailing one good act[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] on to another so as not to leave the smallest gap between?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	30. There is one Light of the Sun, even though its continuity be broken by walls, mountains,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and countless other things. There is one common Substance, even though it be broken up into countless bodies individually characterized. There is one Soul, though it be broken up among countless natures and with individual limitations. There is one Intelligent Soul, though it seem to be divided. Of the things mentioned, however, all the other parts, such as Breath, are the material Substratum of things,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] devoid of sensation and the ties of mutual affinity—yet even they are knit together by the faculty of intelligence and the gravitation which draws them together. But the mind is peculiarly impelled towards what is akin to it, and coalesces with it, and there is no break in the feeling of social fellowship.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	31. What dost thou ask for? Continued existence? But what of sensation? Of desire? Of growth? Or again of coming to an end? Of the use of speech? The exercise of thought? Which of these, thinkest thou, is a thing to long for? But if these things are each and all of no account, address thyself to a final endeavour to follow Reason and to follow God.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] But it militates against this to prize such things, and to grieve if death comes to deprive us of them.

	The Speeches of Marcus
	Introduction
	Marcus learnt from Rusticus to “eschew rhetoric and fine language”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and thanked the Gods that “he had not made more progress in his rhetorical studies,”[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] but the Greek in which he clothed his [c dimgray]Thoughts[/c] shews that he had made some progress in them, and Dio says he was
	“practised in the principles of rhetoric.”[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Only three speeches, purporting to be by Marcus, have come down to us. It is not certain how far we can accept them as authentic. The first is reported by Dio Cassius, who was twenty at the time of its delivery, and as he lived at Rome, and afterwards held high office in the state, he had ample sources of information. He expressly states that Marcus read this address to the soldiers on the rebellion of Cassius, and being written it was more likely to have been preserved verbatim. It cannot be denied that the speech has touches characteristic of Marcus, but of course these might have been purposely introduced by a skilful forger. On the other hand the style is rather rhetorical and artificial and more in keeping with Dio’s known proclivities. Still there is a dignity and restraint, not altogether unworthy of the occasion, noticeable throughout. Unfortunately it only comes to us in the epitome of Xiphilinus, and we do not know how far he has curtailed it, and it certainly seems

	too short for such an occasion. In any case it must have been delivered in Latin.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The last remark applies also to the dying speech of Marcus as given by Herodian, another contemporary authority, but one who was fond of composing suitable speeches for his characters when what they had actually said was not recoverable. The shortness of this speech may be said to be in its favour, as the Emperor was in the last stages of his illness. The opening words are perhaps too plaintive and personal, but the remainder is natural and appropriate. The last few words of such a ruler and friend must have impressed his hearers and may well have been taken down at the time. Still it is strange that there is no hint of this speech in the description of the last scene given by Capitolinus.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The third speech, from the “Life of Avidius Cassius”
	by Gallicanus, is much less likely to be genuine. That particular piece of work is full of suspected material, and Marius Maximus, from whom this speech is probably taken, though a contemporary, is not a trustworthy authority, while the diction and absurd rhetoric of the missive, for it was a speech sent to the Senate and not delivered in it, are decidedly against its genuineness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Note
	As the Speeches and Sayings cannot definitely be attributed to Marcus Aurelius it was thought advisable to print them in smaller type in order to distinguish them from his authentic work.

	<h2>[c dimgray]Speech to the Army on the news of the Revolt of Cassius[/c],
	175 a.d.</h2>
	Marcus, learning of the revolt from Verus, the Governor of Cappadocia, kept the news secret for a time, but as the soldiers were both greatly perturbed by the rumour and were freely discussing it, he called them together and read the following speech:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“It is not, 0 fellow soldiers, to give way to resentment or lamentations that I am come before you. For what avails it to be wroth with the Divinity that can do whatever pleaseth Him? Still, perhaps, they that are undeservedly unfortunate cannot but bewail their lot; and that is the case with me now. For it is surely a terrible thing for us to be engaged in wars upon wars; surely it is shocking to be involved even in civil strife, and surely it is more than terrible and more than shocking that there is no faith to be found among men, and that I have been plotted against by one whom I held most dear and, although I had done no wrong and committed no transgression, have been forced into a conflict against my will. For what rectitude shall be held safe, what friendship be any longer deemed secure, seeing that this has befallen me? Has not Faith utterly perished, and good Hope perished with it? Yet I had counted it a slight thing, had the danger been mine alone—for assuredly I was not born immortal—but now that there has been a defection, or rather a revolt, in the state, and the war comes home to all of us equally, I would gladly, had it been possible, have invited Cassius to argue the question out before you or before the Senate, and willingly without a contest have made way for him in the supreme power, had that seemed expedient for the common weal. For it is only in the public interest that I continue to incur toil and danger, and have spent so much time here beyond the bounds of Italy, an old man as I now am

	“But since Cassius would never agree to meet me for this purpose—for what faith could he have in me who kept so ill his faith to me?—you, my fellow soldiers, must in any case be of good cheer. For never, I take it, have Cilicians and Syrians and Jews and Egyptians been a match for you, and never will be, no, not though their muster was as many thousand times more numerous than yours as it is now less. Nor need even Cassius himself, ever so good a commander though he is reputed to be, and credited with many successful campaigns, be held of any great account at the present crisis. For an eagle at the head of daws makes no formidable foe, nor a lion at the head of fawns, and as for the Arabian war and the great Parthian war, it was you, not Cassius, who brought them to a successful end. Moreover, even if he has won distinction by his Parthian campaigns, you too have Verus, who has won not less but even far more victories, and made greater acquisitions than he.

	“But perhaps even now, learning that I am alive, he has repented of his action; for surely it was only because he believed me dead, that he acted thus. But if he still maintain his opposition, yet when he learns that we are indeed marching against him, he will doubtless take a different view both from dread of you and from reverence for me. I at any rate, fellow soldiers, have but one fear—for I will tell you the whole truth—that either he should take his own life from very shame of coming into our presence, or that another should slay him, learning both that I shall come and that I am actually setting out against him. For great is the prize of war and of victory—a prize such as no one among men has ever won—of which I shall be deprived. And what is that? To forgive a man who has done wrong, to be still a friend to one who has trodden friendship underfoot, to continue faithful to one who has broken faith. What I say may perhaps seem to you incredible, but you must not disbelieve it;

	for, I take it, all that is good has not vanished utterly from among men, but there still remains among us a vestige of pristine virtue. But if any be incredulous, the greater even on that account is my desire that he should with his own eyes see actually done that which no man would believe could be done. For this would be the only gain I could get from my present troubles, if I were able to bring the matter to an honourable conclusion, and show to all the world that even civil war can be dealt with on right principles.”[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]

	[b][c dimgray]From a Speech of Marcus Antoninus (sent to the Senate[/c]).[/b]
	“In return, then, for your congratulations on our victory, Conscript Fathers, you have as consul my son-in-law Pompeianus, whose mature years should long ago have been rewarded with a consulship had not other brave men had prior claims for recognition from the state. Now with regard to the rebellion of Cassius, I beg and beseech you, Conscript Fathers, to lay aside all thoughts of severity and safeguard my or rather your humanity and clemency, and let no single person be put to death by the Senate. Let no Senator be punished, the blood of no man of noble birth be spilt; let the exiles return, the proscribed recover their goods. Would that I could recall the condemned also from the Shades! For revenge for his own wrongs never sits well on an emperor; the more it is deserved, the more vindictive it seems. So you must pardon the children of Avidius Cassius, and his son-in-law, and his wife. But why do I say “pardon,” whereas [c dimgray]they[/c] have done no wrong? Let them live, then, in security, knowing that they five under Marcus. Let them live on their patrimony proportionately divided; let them enjoy their gold, their silver, their raiment;

Nor is this any great clemency, O Conscript Fathers, that the children and wives of the proscribed should be pardoned: but what I ask of you is that you should shield all accomplices of Cassius among the Senators or Knights from death, proscription, apprehension, degradation, hatred, and in fact from all injury, and grant this glory to my reign, that in a rebellion against the throne he only should prove to have been slain who fell in the revolt.”

	“That you should be grieved at seeing me in this state is not surprising, for it is natural to mankind to pity the misfortunes of their kinsfolk, and the calamities which fall under our own eyes call forth greater compassion. But I think that something even more will be forthcoming from you to me; for the consciousness of my feelings towards you has led me to hope for a recompense of goodwill from you. But now the time is well-timed both for me to learn that I have not lavished love and esteem upon you in vain for all these years, and for you by snowing your gratitude to prove that you are not unmindful of the benefits you have received. You see here my son, whose bringing-up has been in your own hands, just embarking upon the age of manhood and, like a ship amid storm and breakers, in need of those who shall guide the helm, lest in his want of experience of the right course

	he should be dashed upon the rock of evil habits. Be ye therefore to him many fathers in the place of me, his one father, taking care of him and giving him the best counsel. For neither can any wealth, however abundant, suffice for the incontinence of a tyranny, nor a bodyguard be strong enough to protect the ruler, unless he has first of all the good-will of the governed. For those rulers complete a long course of sovranty without danger who instil into the hearts of their subjects not fear by their cruelty, but love by their goodness. For it is not those who serve as slaves under compulsion, but those who are obedient from persuasion, that are above suspicion, and continue doing and being done by without any cloak of flattery, and never show restiveness unless driven to it by violence and outrage. And it is difficult to check and put a just limit to our desires when Power is their minister. By giving my son then such advice, and bringing to his memory what he now hears with his own ears, you will render him both for yourselves and all mankind the best of kings, and you will do my memory the greatest of services, and thus alone be enabled to make it immortal.”

	[b]The Sayings of Marcus[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	Nothing lets us into the secret of a man’s character better than little anecdotes about him, and even seemingly trivial sayings uttered by him without any thoughts of a listening posterity. Unfortunately few such reminiscences of Marcus are extant, but the little that remains will be found to throw some light on a character which it has become too much the fashion to accuse of feebleness, criminal complaisance and inefficiency on the one hand, and on the other of harshness and cruelty. No support is given here to either of these mutually destructive views of a personality that was a striking combination of sweetness and gravity,’[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] of mildness and tenacity, of justice and mercy. We see a truly Teligious man who lived up to his creed,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] a tempered Stoicism.

	[b](6)[/b]
	So averse from all bloodshed was his disposition that, though at the people’s request he allowed a lion trained to devour men to be introduced into the arena, yet he not only refused to look at it himself or to enfranchize its trainer, in spite of a persistent demonstration of the audience against him, but even had it proclaimed that [c dimgray]the man had done nothing to deserve freedom[/c].[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]

	Herodes was driven frantic by this calamity[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and came up to the Emperor’s seat of judgment no longer in his right mind and in love with death. For coming forward he set himself to rail at the Emperor, and without veiling his meaning or keeping his anger in hand, as might have been expected from one who was practised in such rhetorical devices, but in defiant and unbridled language he gave vent to his passion, saying “This is all that comes of my friendship with Lucius,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] whom you sent to me, that in judging me you gratify your wife and three-year old child.”[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] But when Bassaeus,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] who had been invested with the power of capital punishment, threatened him with death, Herodes said, “My fine fellow, an old man has little more to fear.” Saying this he left the court without availing himself of his full time for speaking.

	he did not frown, or so much as turn his eyes, as even an arbitrator might have done, but turning to the Athenians said: [c dimgray]Make your plea, men of Athens, even though Herodes is not for allowing you to do so[/c]. And as he listened to their case, at many points he was secretly grieved, but when the complaint of the Athenian Assembly was being read to him, in which they openly attacked Herodes for trying to win over the Governors of Greece with many honeyed words, and somewhere or other even cried out, “O bitter honey!” and again, “Happy they that perish in the pestilence!” he was so deeply moved by what he heard, that he was brought to tears in the sight of all. But as the case of the Athenians comprised an accusation against his freedmen as well as against Herodes, Marcus diverted his anger on to the freedmen, punishing them however as leniently as possible—for that is how he himself characterizes his sentence,—but to Alcimedon alone he remitted the punishment, alleging that his calamity in respect of his children was punishment enough.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] In a way then thus worthy of a philosopher did Marcus act on this occasion.

	When the head of Cassius was brought to him, Antoninus shewed no exultation or pride, but even lamented that [c dimgray]he had been robbed of an opportunity for compassion, for he had wished to take him alive, he said, that he might reproach him with the benefits he had done him, and then spare his life[/c]. Lastly when one said that Antoninus was to blame for his clemency toward his enemy and his enemy’s children and relations and all whom he had found to be accomplices in the usurpation, the man who had imputed the blame going on to say, “What if he had been successful? “Marcus is said to have answered, [c dimgray]My worship of the Gods has not been such, my life is not such, that he could be successful[/c].

His opinion of Galba was similar, for he remarked that  in an Emperor avarice[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] was the most hateful of faults. In a word, rebels had never been able to overcome either Augustus or Trajan or Hadrian or his own father, for many as they were, they had been crushed against the wish or without the knowledge of the reigning Emperor. Antoninus himself, however, besought the Senate [c dimgray]not to proceed with severity against accomplices in the rebellion[/c], asking at the same time that [c dimgray]no Senator should in his reign be punished with death[/c]; and this won for him the greatest love.

	[b](16)[/b]
	It is no flatterer’s praise but the truest and most just to call Aristides the founder of Smyrna. For he made so moving a lament to Marcus over the utter destruction of this city by earthquakes and openings in the ground, that over the rest of the mournful tale the Emperor sighed repeatedly, but at the “breezes blowing over a city of desolation” he even let tears fall upon the writing, and granted the restoration of the city in accordance with the suggestions of Aristides. It chanced also that Aristides had already made the acquaintance of Marcus in Ionia, for when they were attending the lectures of the Athenian Damianus, the Emperor who had already been three days in Smyrna, not yet knowing Aristides personally, requested the Quintilii[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] to see that the man should not be passed over unnoticed in the imperial levée. They said

And Aristides said, “A professional problem, O King, occupied me, and the mind, when so engaged, must not be detached from the prosecution of its enquiry.” The Emperor, charmed by the man’s character, his extreme naïveté and studiousness, said, [c dimgray]When shall I hear you[/c]?

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]For this anecdote [c dimgray]cp.[/c] Dio, 71. 1, § 2: λέγεται καὶ αὐτοκράτωρ

	177–8, before the last departure to the war. At this

	[b](19)[/b]
	Of this Lucius[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] another surprising story is told. The Emperor Marcus was an eager disciple of Sextus the Boeotian philosopher,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] being often in his company and frequenting his house. Lucius, who had just come to Rome, asked the Emperor, whom he met on his way, where he was going to and on what errand, and Marcus answered,  It is good even for an old man to learn;[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] I am now on my way to Sextus the philosopher to learn what I do not yet know. And Lucius, raising his hand to heaven, said, “O Zeus, the king of the Romans in his old age takes up his tablets and goes to school. But my king Alexander died before he was thirty-two.”

	[b](20)[/b]
	When he began to sicken, he sent for his son, and at first besought him not to neglect the relics of the war,[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]The Emperor, if he said these words, can hardly be acquitted of some affectation, as he had a very large fortune in his own right, inherited from his mother and also through Faustina.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]A philosopher friend of Herodes Attious.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]Sextus was grandson of Plutarch and a teacher of Marcus; see Capit. iii. 2, and Marcus himself (i. 9 and note), from which we see what he learnt “in his old age.” He also “shewed off” his philosophy before Sextus; see Themistius, [c dimgray]Orat.[/c] xi. 145b.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]In this he was in the good company of our own great Alfred, [c dimgray]cp.[/c] also Seneca, [c dimgray]Ep.[/c] 76: tamdiu discendum est, quamdiu nescias; Solon, [c dimgray]Fragm.[/c] 8. Bergk, γηράσκων δ᾿ αἰεὶ πολλὰ διδασκόμενος.

Then he abstained from food and drink,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] wishing to die, and aggravated the disease. On the sixth day he called for his friends, and mocking earthly things, but setting death at naught, he said to them, [c dimgray]Why weep for me and not rather think on the pestilence and the death that awaits all[/c]?

	The Sayings of Marcus

	[b](22)[/b]
	When the Emperor Marcus said to Herodes, “What do you think of Polemon?” he, fixing his eyes, answered, “Hark! on my ears there is falling the thunder of galloping chargers,” signifying thereby the measured beat and resonance of his words . . .
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Smyrna, being engaged in a dispute about the Shrines and the privileges attached to them, had chosen as their advocate Polemon, now come to the end of his life. But when just about to start on his journey to defend their rights he died, and the city fell into the hands of other advocates; but when these were putting their case badly in the Emperor’s court, the latter, turning to the envoys from Smyrna, said, “Was not Polemon appointed your advocate in this contest?” “Yea,” they said, “if you mean the Sophist.” “Perhaps, then,” said the Emperor, “he had composed some speech in behalf of your rights, as was likely, since he was about to contend before me and for such important issues.” “Possibly so, O King,” said they, “but not to our knowledge.” The Emperor then adjourned the case till the speech could be brought over; and when it had been read in court the Emperor gave his verdict in accordance with it; and Smyrna went away having gained the primacy, and asserting that Polemon had come to life again for their sake.

	Note on the Attitude of Marcus Towards the Christians
	with
	His Edict Addressed to the Common Assembly of Asia
	[c dimgray]Marcus and the Christians.[/c]
	(i. 6, iii. 16, vii. 68, viii. 48. 51, xi. 3.)
	Nothing has done the good name of Marcus so much harm as his supposed uncompromising attitude towards the Christians, and in this connexion great emphasis has been laid upon a passage in the present book where the Christians, according to our accepted text, are mentioned. It will be worth while to examine this and certain other passages in the book and see if they throw any light on Marcus’ real sentiments towards the Christians.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Taking xi. 3 first, we note that παράταξις, which is persistently translated [c dimgray]obstinacy[/c] to bring it into line with Pliny’s [c dimgray]obstinatio[/c], does not mean obstinacy at all, but [c dimgray]opposition[/c].[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] This is clear from the use of the word and its verb elsewhere by Marcus. In iii. 3 it is used in its primary sense of armies opposite one another on the field of battle. The only passage where the verb occurs (viii. 48) is very instructive. “Remember,” he says, “that the ruling Reason shows itself unconquerable when, concentrated in itself, it is content with itself, so
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Since this was written I find that M. A. P. Lemercier ([c dimgray]Les Pemées de Marc-Aurèle[/c], Introd. p. viii. note 2) quotes with approval E. Havet’s similar interpretation. Suidas glosses παράταξις with πόλεμος ἐμπαράσκευος.

	[c darkmagenta][b]The Sayings of Marcus[/b][/c]
	it do nothing that it doth not will, even if it refuse from mere unreasoning opposition (κἂν ἀλόγως παρατάξηται).” Here the word is used in exactly the same connexion as in xi. 3, and by no means in a sense entirely condemnatory. It seems to me quite possible that the Emperor may have had the Christians in mind here as well as in xi. 3. Conduct such as that of the Christians was precisely what Marcus is never tired of recommending, viz., not under any compulsion to transgress the demands of the ruling Reason,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and if it were found impossible to act up to the standard of right set by the conscience (τὸ ἔνδον ἱδρύμενον) owing to external causes, then to depart cheerfully from life. It appears to me that Marcus in both these passages is really approving of the resistance.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Again the actual mention of the Christians here requires to be considered. The word itself was taboo with the pagan stylists as a barbarism. Even when they are apparently alluding to Christians, such writers as Epictetus, Dio Chrysostom, Plutarch, Aristides, Apuleius, Dio Cassius, Philostratus, do not use the term—much as an Arnold or a Pater would hesitate to use the word “Salvationist.” We do not find it in Fronto’s extant works nor Galen’s. Lucian, however, employed it in the [c dimgray]Alexander[/c] and the [c dimgray]Peregrinus[/c], if (which some deny) these works are by him. Marcus would no doubt have used the word, as Trajan, Pliny and Hadrian did, in rescripts and official documents, but it is a question whether his literary purism and the example of his favourite Epictetus would have allowed him to employ it in a Greek philosophical treatise. When we look at the clause, Χριστιανοί, as here inserted, we see that it is outside the construction, and in fact ungrammatical. It is in the very form of a marginal note,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] and has every appearance of being a gloss foisted into the text. But even if the words be omitted, Marcus may still have had the
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]He says (viii. 41) that ‘nothing can overbear this Reason, not steel, nor tyrant, nor obloquy.’
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]I see Lemercier holds the same view.

	[c darkmagenta][b]The Sayings of Marcus[/b][/c]
	Christians in mind when he wrote the passage, which only condemns an eagerness to meet death without real justification and without due dignity.[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There are other expressions in this book which seem to glance at a body of men who must have been often in Marcus’s thoughts. For instance, when he speaks (vii. 68) of those who “can live out their lives in the utmost peace of mind, [c dimgray]even though all the world cry out against them what they choose, and the beasts tear them limb from limb[/c]” he cannot be thinking of criminals in the ordinary sense of the word, for it is evident that innocent people are meant, and if so, what innocent people received such treatment? It is not at all impossible—I think it highly probable—that Marcus looked upon the Christians as misguided enthusiasts, who had to be punished as the law then stood,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] but whom he no more than Hadrian and Pius[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] wished to punish. Again (vii. 51) he quotes the indignant cry of whom but the Christians? [c dimgray]They kill us, they cut us limb from limb, they execrate us[/c]! Adding the comment: [c dimgray]How does that prevent you from being pure, sane, sober, just[/c]? In yet another place (iii. 16), in words that point still more conclusively to the Christians, he acknowledges that to own the Intelligence as ruler and guide to what is a clear duty is found also among “[c dimgray]those who do not believe in Gods, and those who will not stand by[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]This is not much more than what Clem. Alex, says, [c dimgray]Stromata[/c], iv. 4. There were some egregious cases of voluntary martyrdom in Spain under the Moslems (see the present writer’s [c dimgray]Christianity and Islam in Spain[/c], pp. 37 ff.). See also the conduct of Callistus, afterwards Bishop of Rome. Hippolytus, [c dimgray]Refut. Haer.[/c] ix. 12. Nor were philosophers exempt from the reproach of dying [c dimgray]iactationis causa[/c] (see [c dimgray]Digest[/c], xxvii. 3. 6. 7).
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]This was the view of Rusticus, his’ domestic philosopher.’ (See [c dimgray]Acts of Justin Martyr.[/c])
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]This is clear from the joint letter of Marcus and Pius to the Larissaeans, Thessalonicans, Athenians, and all the Greeks against mob-violence towards the Christians; see Melito in Eusebius, iv. 26, § 10).

	[c dimgray]their country, and those who do their deeds behind closed doors[/c],” Now all these three were the stock charges against Christians, and who can doubt they are hinted at here? Lastly there is the reference to exorcism (i. 6),[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] in which Marcus says that Diognetus taught him to disbelieve.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As a matter of fact, Marcus has been condemned as a persecutor of the Christians on purely circumstantial and quite insufficient grounds. The general testimony of contemporary Christian writers is against the supposition. So is the known character of Marcus. His distinguishing characteristic, in which he excelled all recorded rulers, was humanity. His φιλανθρωπία is mentioned by Galen, Dio, Philostratus, Athenagoras (twice), Melito, and Aristides (eleven times); and his [c dimgray]humanitas[/c] by the eminent jurist Callistratus.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] As soon could Alexander have turned his back in the day of battle as Marcus shown cruelty to his subjects, however lowly. “Never,” says Marcus in the eighth book of his self-communings, “have I willingly injured another” and Themistius ([c dimgray]Orat.[/c] 15) records how, when penned in by his enemies in a new Caudine Forks, he raised his hands to Heaven and cried, “With this hand wherewith I have shed no blood, I appeal to Thee and beseech the Giver of life.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He had a passion for justice, and was most scrupulous in his observance of law, as Papinian, the greatest of jurists, has told us. That he should have encouraged mob-violence against unoffending persons, ordered the torture of innocent women and boys, and violated the rights of citizenship in his insensate fury, is as inconceivable as that St. Louis should have broken the Christian law or become a Mohammedan. That some Christians suffered for their religion in the reign of Marcus is most

	probable, though there is perhaps no single martyrdom attributed to this period of which the date[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] is certain beyond cavil. That there was in any sense a general persecution of the Christians at this time is contrary to all the facts. There were numbers of them in Rome itself, with a Bishop at their head. There were actually Christians in the Emperor’s household and probably ([c dimgray]e.g.[/c] Apollonius) in the Senate itself. Of all these Roman Christians we only hear of Justin and his six companions being martyred, one of them being a slave of the Emperor. Other Christian slaves in the royal household survived him. If he wished to put down Christianity, why did he not begin with his own palace and with Rome?[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So far from persecuting them, we know that as subordinate ruler with Pius[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] he was responsible for the letter to the Greek cities forbidding outrages against the Christians. The letter to the Common Assembly of Asia, given below, if authentic, emanated from him in conjunction with Pius or from him alone. Its genuineness in the main has been upheld by Harnack, and is certainly capable of defence.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Dr. Abbott has given plausible reasons for doubting the date of the Lyons martyrdom, and some ([c dimgray]e.g.[/c] Havet) deny the authenticity of the letter in Eusebius.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]The famous caricature of the Christian religion found in the pages’ quarters in the Palatine (see Lanciani, [c dimgray]Ancient Rome[/c] 122) dates from this reign.

	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]This portion of the edict seems too favourable to the Christians for even Marcus to have promulgated.

	[b]Marcus as Letter-writer[/b]
	Perhaps the more interesting part of the Fronto correspondence is that which contains the letters of Marcus and Pius. But we cannot fairly judge of their epistolary style from these alone. Philostratus says[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] that “in his opinion the best letter writers for style were .... of kings the deified Marcus in the letters he wrote himself, for the firmness (τὸ ἐδραῖον) of his character was reflected in his writing by his choice of language; and of orators Herodes the Athenian, though by his over-atticism and prolixity[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] he often oversteps the bounds proper to the epistolary style.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Marcus was a prolific letter-writer. According to Capitolinus[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] he defended himself against calumny by letters. To his friends he sometimes, as we see below, wrote three times in one day. On one occasion he tells us that he had dictated thirty letters,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] but these were probably official correspondence. Nearly 200 of his imperial rescripts are extant, which though interesting would be out of place here. Many are in

	In answer to Ulpius Eurycles,[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] [c dimgray]curator[/c] of Ephesus, asking what should be done with old decayed statues of preceding emperors in the Ephesian senate house, we find the interesting pronouncement, “There must be no re-working of the material into likenesses of us. For as we are not in other respects solicitous of honours for ourselves, much less should we permit those of others to be transferred to us. As many of the statues as are in good preservation should be kept under their original names, but with respect to those that are too battered to be identified, perhaps their titles can be recovered from inscriptions on their bases or from records that may exist in the possession of the Council, so that our progenitors may rather receive a renewal of their honour than

	[m1]\ [/m]
	There are, besides, two or three inscriptions and one papyrus, all much mutilated,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] recording letters or rescripts of Marcus, one in 163 to Pontius Laelianus, consul of that year. It contains a rare word γλωσσόκομον, rejected by Phrynichus.[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Besides the above there are extant only two letters or parts of letters that are certainly genuine. Following these are two letters from Christian sources, the letter to Euxenianus Publio with respect to Abercius, bishop of Hieropolis, and the letter to the Senate purporting to give a report of the “Miraculous Victory” over the Quadi. The fact of the victory with the unexpected salvation of the Roman army is certain, but the heathen writers attribute it to the prayers of the emperor or the incantations of an Egyptian [c dimgray]magus[/c].
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After these two letters come ten short epistles, or parts of such, which would be of considerable interest if their authenticity were established. Till comparatively lately they were accepted unquestion-ingly, and afforded material for charges against Marcus. They are all found in the [c dimgray]Scnptores Historiae Augustae[/c], a late compilation of the fourth Century, intended as a supplement to Suetonius’s [c dimgray]Lives of the Caesars[/c], and attributed to various authors.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But in spite of Renan and Waddington and Naber and others, who have quoted them as evidence, they cannot be regarded as genuine. They contain several

	later words, and their style is rhetorical and unworthy of the subjects treated. The puerile playing upon words, [c dimgray]Avidius[/c] ... [c dimgray]avidus[/c], etc. betrays their artificial character. Writing of Cassius, the general who conducted the Parthian war to a successful conclusion and afterwards in 175 rebelled against Marcus, the latter is represented as quoting γνῶμαι from Suetonius instead of giving his own opinions. Moreover facts mentioned in the letters are at variance with what is known from other sources. For instance, Marcus was not in or near Rome in 175, as required by the Faustina correspondence; nor was Pompeianus, his son-law, consul in 176; nor was Lucius ever spoken of as grandson of Pius, but always as his son and the brother of Marcus; nor could Fadilla in 175 be alluded to as [c dimgray]puella virgo[/c], for by that time she would have been twenty-five and almost certainly married.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is also incredible that Avidius Cassius should have contemplated revolt, and so openly as to arouse definite suspicions in the mind of Verus, so long before the actual outbreak. We know from Fronto’s letters[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] that Verus and Cassius were on excellent terms as late as 165, and Fronto’s own letter[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] to him shews the estimation in which he was then held. When Cassius revolted, Marcus felt it deeply as the defection of a friend.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Equally rhetorical and fictitious is a letter said to be from Cassius to his son-in-law:[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] “Marcus is assuredly an excellent man, but while he covets a reputation for clemency, he lets those live whose lives he does not approve. Where is Lucius Cassius, whose name I bear in vain?

	Where the great Marcus Cato the Censor? Where all the discipline of our ancestors? Marcus Antoninus philosophizes and enquires about first principles and about the soul and about what is honourable and just, and has no thought for the State[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]..... You have heard of the [c dimgray]praefectus praetorio[/c][c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] [c dimgray]of[/c] our philosopher, who was a beggarly pauper three days before he was appointed, but has suddenly become rich—whence, pray, if not from the vitals of the State and the property of the provincials?[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] Well, let them be rich, let them be opulent: they will serve to fill the public treasury.” By a commonplace of the rhetorical schools Cassius in another passage is made to liken himself to Catiline and Marcus to the [c dimgray]dialogista[/c] (Cicero).[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	However there are some touches in the correspondence which are true to character, such as the words attributed to Lucius, “I do not hate the man,” which are in keeping with his well-known [c dimgray]bonitas[/c], and the “Perish my children” of Marcus, which he might well have said. But he is not likely to have quoted Suetonius or Horace, to the latter of whom he took a dislike[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] in his younger days. The fabricator of the letters was perhaps Aemilius Parthenianus, a writer of the third or fourth century.

	Wishing to make trial whether Marcus was angry with him owing to what had occurred at the trial,[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] he sent him a letter not containing excuses but a complaint, for he said that “he wondered for what reason Marcus no longer wrote to him, though in times past he wrote so often that on one occasion three letter-carriers reached him on a single day, one treading on the heels of another.”

	Having had experience of your sagacity in your works themselves, and especially in those which you carried out by order of our authority in respect to Smyrna in alleviating the calamity that befell the Smyrniotes owing to the earthquake[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] there, I have been pleased, as was natural, and praise you for your diligence in carrying out these duties. For I have been apprized of everything exactly as if I had been present. For everything has been clearly recounted to me by the report sent from you, and by him who presented it, and by Caecilius the procurator. But with respect to the present matter, it has come to the knowledge of our power that a certain Abercius,[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] bishop of Hieropolis, is living in your jurisdiction, a

	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]The [c dimgray]Acta[/c] of Abercius (Migne’s [c dimgray]Patrol Graec[/c]. cxv. p. 1211) state that the bishop reached Rome while Marcus was away fighting the barbarians.

As a reward he asked for a bath to be made for the hot-springs at Hieropolis, and that 3,000 bushels of corn should be given yearly to that his native city.

	The Letter[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] of the Emperor Marcus to the Senate in which he testifies that the Christians were the Cause of the Victory of the Romans

	1. The Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Germanicus Parthicus Sarmaticus[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] to the People of the Romans and the Sacred Senate, greeting:

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]Marcus in his [c dimgray]Thoughts[/c] professes disbelief in exorcism (i. 6). This is only one proof out of many that this letter is a Christian forgery. Christian tradition was strongly in favour of Marcus. Baronius early in the seventeenth century had in his possession a letter purporting to be from Abercius to M. Aurelius, which he intended to publish, but lost.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c]Found at the end of Justin’s second [c dimgray]Apology[/c].
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c]This title does not seem to have been assumed till 175. The “miraculous victory” took place, as generally held, in 174.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c]Though this letter is certainly spurious, yet there must have been a report to the senate by Marcus on the remarkable victory gained over the Quadi, of which both Christian and heathen writers make mention. The latter attributed the victory to the prayers or merits of the emperor, the Christians to the intercessions of the soldiers of their religion in the [c dimgray]Legio fulminata[/c], called from their success [c dimgray]fulminatrix[/c]. It is curious, however, that this legion (twelfth) is not mentioned here. The commander was probably Pertinax (see [c dimgray]Chronicon Paschale[/c]), not Pompeianus, the son-in-law of Marcus. The word δράκοντες (serpents, [c dimgray]i.e[/c]. standards of cohorts) is also used by Lucian, [c dimgray]Quom. Hist[/c]. 29. It here stands for the name of the barbarian regiments or divisions (Drungi). For the victory see Claudian [c dimgray]De tert. Consulatu[/c] 93.

Our scouts informed us when they had come near us, and Pompeianus, our commander, shewed us what we also saw for ourselves—for I had been suddenly surrounded by a huge and savage multitude while having with me a composite and moderate force drawn from the First legion and the Tenth (both the Twin and the Fretensian)—that there were masses of men in a miscellaneous host numbering 977,000.

	2. When, therefore, I compared myself and my numbers with the immense hordes of the barbarian enemy, I took refuge in prayer to the Gods of our fathers. But being disregarded by them, and looking at the straits to which my force was reduced, I called upon those whom we name Christians—and by enquiry I found out the greatness of their numbers—going so far as to inveigh against them, which I ought not to have done, for I afterwards learnt their power.

It is likely, then, that they whom we suppose to be godless have a selfacting God entrenched in their conscience. For casting themselves on the ground they prayed, not for me alone, but also for the whole army, that He would relieve our present drought and famine. For we had taken no water for five days, as there was none to be had, for we were in the very heart of Germany and far within their frontiers.

	Laudanda est Albini constantia, qui graviter deficientes exercitus tenuit, quom ad Avidium Cassium confugerent. Et nisi hic fuisset, omnes fecissent. Habemus igitur virum dignum consulatu, quem sufficiam in locum Cassii Papirii, qui mihi exanimis prope iam nuntiatus est. Quod interim a te publicari nolo, ne aut ad ipsum Papirium aut ad eius adfectus perveniat, nosque videamur in locum viventis consulem subrogasse.

	seen service, is of austere life and serious character. I think that his appointment will be of advantage to the army; that it will not be disadvantageous, I am sure. I have granted him double allowances, a simple military robe, but four times the pay of his rank. Exhort him to shew himself a pattern to the State for he is assured a reward equal to his deserts.

	[b]From a Letter about Albinus written by Marcus During the Rebellion of Avidius Cassius[/b]
	? 175–176 a.d.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The loyalty of Albinus is worthy of all praise in that he kept to their allegiance troops that were seriously disaffected, when they were ready to go over to Cassius. And had he not been on the spot, the defection would have been general. In him then we have a man worthy of the consulship, and I will appoint him in the room of Cassius Papirius, who, as I have just been told, is dying. But I would rather not have this appointment made public at present, that it may not get to the ears of Papirius himself or his relations, lest we seem to have elected a consul to take the place of one who is still alive.

And so I have sent a letter to be read to the troops, in which I have given him the command of three hundred Armenians and a hundred Sarmatians and a thousand regulars. It is your part to shew that the man has reached this rank, which my grandfather Hadrian and my great-grandfather Trajan reserved for the most tried soldiers, not by partiality, which is abhorrent to our principles, but by merit.

	Verus was verity itself when he wrote to me of Cassius that he coveted the empire. For I suppose you have heard what news messengers brought of him yesterday. So come to Albanum[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] that by the Gods’ goodwill we may deal with the situation, and do not be alarmed.

	I will come myself as you suggest to Albanum to-morrow. But in the meantime I urge you, as you love your children, take the severest measures against these rebels. For the morale of generals and soldiers is thoroughly bad, and unless you crush them they will crush us.

	Mater mea Faustina patrem tuum Pium \[eiusdem\] in defectione Celsi cohortata est ut pietatem primum circa suos servaret, sic circa alienos. Non enim pius est imperator, qui non cogitat uxorem et filios. Commodus noster vides in qua aetate sit; Pompeianus gener et senior est et peregrinus. Vide quid agas de Avidio Cassio et de eius consciis. Noli parcere hominibus qui tibi non pepercerunt, et nec mihi nec filiis nostris parcerent, si vicissent. Ipsa iter tuum mox consequar. Quia Fadilla nostra aegrotabat, in Formianum venire non potui. Sed si te Formiis invenire non potuero, adsequar Capuam, quae civitas et meam et filiorum nostrorum aegritudinem poterit adiuvare. Soteridam medicum in Formianum ut dimittas rogo. Ego autem Pisitheo nihil credo, qui puellae virgini curationem nescit adhibere. Signatas mihi litteras Calpurnius dedit, ad quas rescribam, si tardavero, per Caecilium senem spadonem, hominem ut scis fidelem. Cui verbo mandabo quid uxor Avidii Cassii et filii et gener de te iactare dicantur.

	My mother Faustina exhorted your father Pius, on the revolt of \[the same\] Celsus, that he should shew loyalty in the first place to his own family and then to others. For an Emperor cannot be called [c dimgray]Pius[/c] who does not think of wife and children. You see how young our Commodus is: Pompeianus, our son-in-law,[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] is both aged and a provincial. See how you deal with Avidius Cassius and his accomplices. Spare not men who have not spared you, and would have spared neither me nor your children, had they succeeded. I will myself soon follow you on your journey. As our Fadilla[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] was ill, I could not come to the Formian Villa.[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] But if I cannot find you at Formiae, I will go on to Capua, a place which is likely to benefit my health and our childrens’. I beseech you send Soteridas the physician to the Formian Villa. I have no faith in Pisitheus, who does not know how to cure our little maid.[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] Calpurnius gave me the sealed letter to which I will send an answer. If I fail to get it off at once, by Caecilius the old eunuch, a man, as you know, to be relied on, I will entrust him with an oral message of what the wife of Avidius Cassius and his children and son-in-law are reported to say about you.

	[b]Addendum[/b]
	A rescript of some length and not without interest, though much mutilated in the last half, has been omitted as not being strictly a letter. It was sent in 162 or 163 from Marcus and Verus conjointly to the logister or “curator” of the Senate of Ephesus in answer to three questions which he had put. After being reproved for applying direct to the Emperor instead of through the proper channels, he was told about the obsolete statues of the emperors in the Senate house of Ephesus, as to which he had asked, whether they, if unidentified, should be altered to represent the reigning Emperor and re-dedicated, that this should of course on no account be done, since the Emperors had not in other cases shown any hankering for honours, much less a wish to take honours from others.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The other matter referred to by Eurycles concerned a certain Saturninus, a slave or servant of the Senate, and the management of the public money.
