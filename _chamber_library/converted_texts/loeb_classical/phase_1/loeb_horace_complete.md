	[b]1[c dimgray]Dedication to Maecenas[/c][/b]
	Maecenas, descended from royal lineage, my protection, my fame and my joy, there are some who enjoy raising Olympic dust with their chariots (the turning post just cleared by their scorching wheels, and the palm of glory, exalt them to heaven as lords of the earth); one man is delighted if the mob of fickle citizens strive to elevate him to the three great offices;[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] another if he has stored in his own barn every grain that is swept from the threshing floors of Libya. If a man takes pleasure in tilling his father’s fields with a hoe, you will never tempt him away, even on Attalus’ terms, to become a terrified sailor cleaving the Sea of Myrto in a Cyprian bark. When a gale from Africa fights with the Icarian waves, the frightened trader recommends an easy life on a farm near his home town; a little later he repairs his shattered fleet, for he cannot learn to put up with modest means. One man does not refuse cups of old Massic, and is prepared to take a slice out of the working day, stretched out at length beneath a leafy arbutus or at

	the gentle source of a sacred stream. Many enjoy camp life: the braying of horns and trumpets, and the battles so abhorred by mothers. The huntsman, without a thought for his young wife, stays out beneath the freezing sky if a deer has been sighted by the faithful hounds, or a Marsian boar has broken through the fine-spun net. As for me, the ivy crown, the reward of poetic brows, puts me in the company of the gods above; the cool grove and the light-footed bands of Nymphs and Satyrs set me apart from the crowd, provided Euterpe does not cease to pipe and Polyhymnia does not refuse to tune the Lesbian lyre. But if you rank me among the lyric bards of Greece, I shall soar aloft and strike the stars with my head.

	Enough fearsome snow and hail has the father now poured upon the earth; he has terrified the city by striking the sacred citadel with his fiery hand, and terrified the people for fear the disastrous age of Pyrrha should return, who cried aghast at unheard-of marvels, when Proteus drove all his seals to visit the high mountains, and the race of fish became lodged in the tops of elm trees, which before had been the home of doves, and panic-stricken deer swam in the all-engulfing flood.

	Sharp winter is loosening its grip as spring and the West Wind bring a welcome change; winches drag down the dry hulls; no longer now do the livestock enjoy the stall or the ploughman his fire; and the meadows are no longer white with hoar frost. Now Cytherean Venus leads the dancers as the moon hangs overhead, and the lovely Graces, hand in hand with the Nymphs, beat the ground with one foot after the other, while glowing Vulcan goes to inspect the heavy forges of the Cyclopes.

Once you reach there, you will not throw dice to decide who directs the party, nor will you gaze in admiration at the boyish Lycidas, who now makes all the young men burn with passion and before long will kindle the desires of the girls.

	[b]15[c dimgray]The prophecy of Nereus[/c][/b]
	When the herdsman was carrying Helen across the sea with Ida’s ships (she was his hostess, he a traitor), Nereus checked the swift winds, imposing on them an unwelcome calm, so that he might utter the dire doom that lay ahead: “It is under an evil omen that you take home a woman whom Greece will reclaim with many a warrior, having sworn an oath to wreck your marriage and with it the ancient kingdom of Priam. Alas, alas! What grievous sweat is in store for horses and men alike! What countless deaths you are bringing to the people of Dardanus! Already Pallas is getting ready her helmet, shield, and chariot, and whetting her fury. In vain will you act the hero under Venus’ protection, comb your hair, and play the ladies’ favourite

In the end, alas, you will still get your adulterous hair dirty in the dust. Look round! There is Laertes’ son, who spells ruin for your people; there is Nestor of Pylos. You are hard pressed by dauntless warriors: Teucer of Salamis and Sthenelus, who is skilled in hand-to-hand fighting and no mean driver if he is called on to command a team of horses. You will also come to know Meriones. And see, the ferocious son of Tydeus, a better man than his father, is mad to track you down. Like a deer, which, on sighting a wolf on the far side of the valley, forgets about the grass, you will run timidly away from him, gasping for breath; this was something you did not promise to your woman!

	They say that when Prometheus was compelled to add an element cut from every animal to our primordial clay, he also put into the human heart the violence of a raging lion. It was anger that laid Thyestes low in dire destruction; anger too is the chief reason why lofty cities have been utterly levelled, and arrogant armies have gouged their walls with a hostile ploughshare. Control your emotions. I too, in my sweet youth, was afflicted with a hot temper which drove me in a passion to write impetuous invectives.

	Often, by way of a change, swift Faunus comes from Lycaeus to my delightful Lucretilis and unfailingly protects my goats from the blazing summer heat and rainy winds. The wives of the malodorous spouse wander unharmed through the safe woodland in search of concealed arbutus leaves and thyme; the kidlings, Tyndaris, have no fear of green snakes or Mars’ wolves, when the valleys and smooth rocks on the slopes of Ustica echo to his sweet pipe. The gods watch over me; the gods are pleased with my devotion and my Muse. Here in your honour Plenty will flow to the full, rich with her horn that pours out the glories of the countryside.

	Here in my secluded valley you will escape the heat of the Dog,[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c] and with Teian lyre sing of Penelope and glass-green Circe, who were lovesick for the same man. Here in the shade you will drink cups of innocuous Lesbian; the son of Semele Thyone[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c] will not combine with Mars to stir up a fight; and you will not have to worry in case the lustful Cyrus, in a fit of jealous suspicion, lay his wild hands on one who is ill-equipped to stand up to him, tearing the garland you have on your head and also your unoffending dress.

	Varus, you should plant no tree in preference to the god-given vine around the genial soil of Tibur and the walls of Catilus;[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c] for the gods have ordained that everything should be hard for the abstemious, and there is no other way to dispel the worries that gnaw the heart. After wine, who rattles on about the hardships of war or poverty? Who does not rather talk of you, Bacchus, and you, lovely Venus?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Yet no one must abuse by excess the gifts of the moderate God of Freedom.[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c] That is the lesson of the drunken brawl over unmixed wine between the Centaurs and Lapiths that ended in a battle. That is the lesson of Euhius[c dimgray][sup]39[/sup][/c] who came down heavily on the Sithonians when, in their eagerness for sex, they drew too fine a line between right and wrong. As for me, I shall never shake you, fair Bassareus,[c dimgray][sup]40[/sup][/c] against your will, nor shall I rudely expose to the daylight things that are hidden under multicoloured leaves.[c dimgray][sup]41[/sup][/c] Silence the wild tambourines and the Berecyntian pipe;[c dimgray][sup]42[/sup][/c] they are attended by blind Self-love, and Glory that holds her empty head far too high, and Trust of the sort that lavishly gives away secrets and is more utterly transparent than glass.

Put me on a lifeless plain where no tree is refreshed by summer breezes, a part of the world oppressed by fog and sullen skies, set me beneath the chariot of the sun where it comes too close to the earth in a land forbidding houses—I shall still love my Lalage with her sweet laughter and her sweet talk.

	you could play more charmingly than Thracian Orpheus the lyre that was once heeded by the trees? Would blood return to the empty wraith once Mercury, who is never soft-hearted enough to open the gates of death in response to prayers, has driven it with his dreaded staff to join the dusky herd? It is hard. But endurance can make lighter what no one is allowed to put right.

	[b]25[c dimgray]Lydia’s charms are fading[/c][/b]
	More sparingly do the lustful lads rattle your closed shutters with volleys of pebbles, depriving you of rest; and the door that of old would, most obligingly, move its hinges hugs the threshold. Less and less often now do you hear “Lydia, are you sleeping, while I your slave am wasting away through the long night?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Your turn will come. When you are an old woman, a thing of no account in a deserted alley, you will weep over your arrogant lechers, while the Thracian wind riots ever more boisterously as the moonless nights draw near; and all the time, burning love, and lust of the kind that maddens the mothers of horses, will rage round your wounded heart; yes, and you will bemoan the fact that happy young males take their pleasure with green ivy rather than dull myrtle; as for withered leaves—they commit them to the East Wind, the henchman of Winter.

	As a friend of the Muses, I shall fling gloom and fear to the turbulent winds to carry them into the Cretan sea; I am singularly indifferent about what king of a frozen region under the Bear is causing alarm, what it is that’s frightening Tiridates. You, sweet Lady of Pipla, who take pleasure in fresh springs, weave sunny flowers, weave them into a garland for my dear Lamia. Without you all my tributes are worthless. To sanctify Lamia with new strings and the quill of Lesbos:[c dimgray][sup]48[/sup][/c] that is a fitting task for you and your sisters.

	Tankards were meant for joy; only Thracians use them as weapons. Away with that barbarous behaviour, and protect Bacchus, who is a respectable deity, from bloody brawls! Where there is wine and lamplight a Persian dagger is utterly out of place. Quieten down this unholy row, my friends, and stay where you are, reclining on your elbow. Do you want me to drink my share of dry Falernian? Well then, let Megylla’s brother from Opus tell us what wound and what arrow have caused the blissful death that he dies.

	You’re reluctant to agree, are you? Well, I shan’t drink on any other terms. Whatever beauty queen has you under her thumb, there’s no need to blush for the ardour she incites—you always fall for the more respectable type. Whatever your plight, come, whisper it in my ear; it’s safe there...Ah! You poor fellow! What a Charybdis you’re caught in! My boy, you deserve a better flame.

	But one common night awaits us all, and the road to death can be trodden only once.

	O goddess, you who reign over your favourite Antium,[c dimgray][sup]66[/sup][/c] ready at hand to raise mortal flesh from the lowest level or to turn an arrogant triumph into a funeral cortege, your support is sought with anxious prayers by the poor tenant farmer, and, as you are mistress of the deep, by whoever provokes the Carpathian Sea in a Bithynian boat; you are dreaded by the rough Dacian and the retreating Scythians,[c dimgray][sup]67[/sup][/c] by cities and peoples (including warlike Latium), by the mothers of foreign princes, and by purple-clad tyrants, afraid that with a violent kick you will topple the standing pillar, and the massed people will arouse the reluctant “to arms! to arms!” and smash their domination.

	For what purpose do the tall pine and white poplar like to form a welcoming shade with their branches? Why does the hurrying water go to the trouble of bustling along its winding course? This is just the place.

	You will leave the woodland pastures that you have bought up, and your town house, and your villa washed by the yellow Tiber; yes, you will leave them, and your heir will take possession of the wealth you have built so high. It makes no difference whether you live beneath the sky as a rich man descended from ancient Inachus, or a poor man of humblest family; you are still a victim of pitiless Orcus. We are all driven to the same pen; for all alike is the lot shaken in the urn; sooner or later, out it will come, and put us aboard the skiff for eternal exile.

	Why, Venus herself laughs at this, yes, laughs; so do the guileless Nymphs and savage Cupid who is forever sharpening his burning arrows on a bloody whetstone. Moreover, a whole generation of young males is growing up to provide you with new slaves, while their predecessors do not leave the house of their unholy mistress, in spite of their frequent threats. You are the one who is dreaded by mothers for your effect on their young steers, by old men, too, who are anxious for their money,[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c] and by virgin brides, unhappy for fear your scent may make their new husbands dally.

You, however, never cease to pursue your lost Mystes with tearful verses; your love does not subside when the evening star rises or when it flees before the on-rushing sun.

	You will keep your life on a straighter course, Licinius, if you neither push continually out to sea, nor, while cautiously avoiding the storms, hug the dangerous shore too closely. The man who cherishes the golden mean maintains a safe position: he escapes the squalor of a tumbledown house and also escapes, because of his moderation, the resentment caused by a mansion. It is more often the tall pine that is shaken by the wind; the collapse is more devastating when high towers fall, and it is the mountain peaks that are struck by lightning. In adversity the well-prepared mind hopes for the opposite situation, is on guard against it in prosperity. Jupiter brings round the ugly winters; he also removes them. If things are bad now, they will not always be so: at times Apollo wakens the slumbering Muse with his lyre; he does not always keep his bow

What wonder, when, entranced by those songs, the hundred-headed beast[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c] relaxes his black ears, and the snakes entwined in the Furies’ hair sink to rest?

Husband and wife are driven out, carrying in their arms their family gods and ragged children. Yet no hall awaits its rich owner more surely than the inevitable terminus of grasping Orcus.

The Colchian shall come to know me, and the Dacian who pretends not to fear the Marsian cohorts, and, furthest of all, the Geloni; the Spaniard will become educated by reading my works, and so will he who drinks the Rhone.

	Provided she shows her courage by rejecting the gold that is undiscovered (and all the better when concealed in the earth) rather than by pressing it into human uses with a hand that greedily snatches at everything holy, then, whatever limit contains the world, let her reach it with her arms, eager to see those places where fires riot unchecked and those where mists and rain showers never lift.

	But on this condition only do I reveal their destiny to the warrior citizens of Rome: they must not, out of excessive piety or confidence in their power, attempt to restore the buildings of ancestral Troy.[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] If the fortune of Troy is born again, that will be under an evil omen, and it will end in mournful disaster as it did before. I, Jove’s wife and sister, will lead the hosts that hurl it to defeat. If, under Phoebus’ direction, her wall were to rise again in solid brass three times, three times would it be destroyed and razed to the ground by my Argives; three times would the captive wife weep for her husband and children.”

	This will never do for a cheerful lyre. Where are you going, Muse? Don’t be so headstrong. Stop reporting the talk of the gods, and diminishing momentous matters with your trivial ditties.

	Because Jove thunders in heaven we have always believed that he is king there; Augustus will be deemed a god on earth when the Britons and the deadly Persians have been added to our empire. Can it be that Crassus’ soldiers have remained alive in disgraceful wedlock with barbarian wives,[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c] and that (alas for the change in our senate and in our national character!) they have grown old in the army of the enemy whose daughters they have married, under the power of a Parthian king—Marsian and Apulian, forgetting shields,[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] name, toga, and undying Vesta,[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c] while Jupiter’s temple and the city of Rome are still standing?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It was this that the far-seeing mind of Regulus had sought to prevent when he rejected humiliating terms and a precedent involving disaster for future generations if the young captives were not left to die without pity. “I have seen our standards nailed up in Punic temples,” he said, “and weapons that were stripped from our soldiers without bloodshed.

Once wool has been doctored with dye it never recovers the colour it has lost; likewise, once true manliness is gone, it refuses to be put back into men who have become worse. If a doe fights when disentangled from the close-meshed nets, then he will be brave who has trusted himself to a deceitful enemy, and he will crush the Carthaginians in another battle who has felt without protest the thongs pinning his arms, and has quailed at the thought of death. The fellow whom we are now considering, not knowing how he could save his life, confused war with peace. Ah, the shame of it! Ah, mighty Carthage raised all the higher by Italy’s ignominious ruins!”

And yet he knew what the barbarous torturer was preparing for him; but he parted the kinsmen who blocked his path and the citizens who tried to prevent his return, just as if, after deciding a case in court, he were now leaving the long-drawn-out business of his clients and making his way to the Venafran countryside or Lacedaemonian Tarentum.

	Though guiltless, you will continue to pay for the sins of your forefathers, Roman, until you repair the crumbling temples and shrines of the gods,[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c] and the statues that are begrimed with black smoke. It is because you hold yourselves inferior to the gods that you rule. For every beginning seek their approval; to them attribute its outcome. Because they have been neglected, the gods have inflicted many a woe on sorrowing Westland. Twice already Monaeses and the troops of Pacorus have broken our unsanctioned attacks, and they beam with pleasure at having added solid plunder to their paltry necklaces. Occupied with internecine feuds, the capital has been almost destroyed by the Ethiopian[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c] and the Dacian, the former a menace with her fleet, the latter superior at shooting arrows.

	Generations prolific in sin first defiled marriage, the family, and the home. From this source is derived the disaster which has engulfed our fatherland and its folk. The girl who has just reached puberty enjoys taking lessons in Ionian dancing, and is trained in the arts that go with it; even at this stage she contemplates illicit love affairs with total absorption. In due course, when her husband is in his cups, she looks for younger lovers; but she does not select some man to whom she may hurriedly give forbidden pleasures when the lamp has been removed; on the contrary,

	hostess’ go-between cunningly tempts him with a thousand ploys, telling him that Chloe is sighing, consumed, poor lady, with the same passion as your own; he recalls how a deceitful woman,[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c] by making false accusations, induced the gullible Proetus to hurry up and murder Bellerophon, who was too chaste for his own good; he tells how Peleus was almost consigned to Tartarus when, in his self-restraint, he tried to evade Magnesian Hippolyte; he cleverly adduces other cases, too, that encourage sin—all in vain; for Gyges is deafer to what he says than the rocks of Icarus, and his virtue is still unimpaired.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But you—make sure that your neighbour Enipeus does not please you more than he ought, even though no one else on the grass of Mars[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c] is seen to be so skilful at maneuvering his horse, and nobody can swim so swiftly down the Tuscan river.[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c] When dusk falls, lock up your house; at the music of his plaintive pipe, don’t look down into the street; and though he calls you hard-hearted again and again, remain unyielding.

	Are you, learned as you are in the discourses of both languages,[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c] wondering about this? Well, I vowed to the God of Freedom[c dimgray][sup]33[/sup][/c] a delicious meal, including a white goat, on the occasion when I was almost sent to my grave by the blow of a tree. As the year comes round, this festal day will remove the cork, with its seal of pitch, from a jar that was first taught to drink the smoke in Tullus’ consulship.[c dimgray][sup]34[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So quaff a hundred ladles, Maecenas, in honour of your friend’s escape, and keep the lamp burning until daylight. Away with all shouting and quarrelling. Cast aside your worries for the capital and its citizens.[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c] The Dacian Cotiso’s army has fallen, our enemy, the Medes, are torn apart by a war that brings grief only to themselves. The Cantabrian, our ancient foe from the coast of Spain, is our slave, tamed and in fetters at long last; now the Scythians have unstrung their bows and prepare to withdraw from their plains.[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c] Don’t worry in case the people are in any trouble; you are a private citizen, so try not to be overanxious; gladly accept the gifts of the present hour, and let serious things go hang.

	[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c]The events in Dacia, Parthia, Spain, and Scythia took place between 29 and 26; so the date of Horace’s celebration is 1 March, 25 b.c.

	As long as I was dear to you, and no favored rival put his arms around your white neck, I lived a richer life than the king of Persia.

	“As long as you had no other flame, and Lydia did not take second place to Chloe, I, Lydia, was a great celebrity and lived a more famous life than Rome’s Ilia.”

	Thracian Chloe now rules me; she can sing sweet songs and play the lyre delightfully. I shan’t be afraid to die for her, if the fates spare my darling and let her live.

	“Calais, the son of Ornytus from Thurii, kindles in me the flame that he feels himself. I’m prepared to die for him twice over, if the fates spare the boy and let him live.”

	Even if you drank the faraway Don, Lyce, and were married to a savage husband, you would still have too much pity to expose me, lying prostrate at your cruel doorway, to the North Winds of your fellow countrymen. Do you not hear how the door rattles, how the trees that grow in your handsome courtyard howl in the gale, while Jupiter is freezing the fallen snow with his cloudless power?

	No more of your haughtiness (Venus doesn’t like it); otherwise the rope may run back as the wheel spins.[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c] Your Etruscan father did not beget you to be a Penelope, spurning all her suitors.[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c] Though you remain unbending in spite of your lovers’ gifts, their appeals, their pallor tinged with yellow,[c dimgray][sup]39[/sup][/c] and in spite of the fact that your husband is smitten by a Pierian mistress, yet at least please spare those who beg for mercy … You are no more pliant than the rigid oak, no more soft-hearted than Moorish snakes. This body of mine will not endure for ever your doorstep and the rain from heaven!

	time when you had no voice and gave no pleasure; now you are welcome at the tables of the rich and the temples of the gods. So come, sing a song to catch Lyde’s obstinate ear. Like a three-year-old filly which frisks and prances in the wide meadows, she shies away from being touched, knows nothing about marriage, and is not yet ripe for an ardent mate.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You have the power to lead tigers and forest trees in your train, and to check swift-flowing streams; Cerberus, grim guardian of the vast hall, surrendered to your charms, even though his head, like the Furies’, is armed with a hundred snakes, and stinking breath and gore issue from his three muzzles each with its tongue. Why even Ixion and Tityus, in spite of themselves, had smiles on their faces; and their pitchers stood dry for a little while as you soothed the daughters of Danaus with delightful music.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Let Lyde hear about the virgins’ crime and their well-known punishment: the urn that was never full because the water leaked away right at the bottom, and the fate which, however delayed, lies in wait for sin even in the depths of Orcus. Those unholy ones (yes, unholy, for what more heinous crime could they have committed?) had the heart to murder their bridegrooms with cold steel. The only one of their number worthy of the marriage torch was magnificently deceitful towards her scheming father, a girl who won everlasting fame.[c dimgray][sup]40[/sup][/c]

	As money grows, it is attended by worry and a craving for more. I have had a horror, quite rightly, of raising my head to an eminence that could be seen from far and wide, Maecenas, glory of the Knights. The more a person denies himself, the more he will receive from the gods. Destitute myself, I want to join the camp of those who desire nothing; a deserter, I am eager to abandon the side of the rich, and thus acquire more credit for being master of the wealth I reject than were I said to hide away in my barns everything that the tireless Apulian reaps, a pauper surrounded by great riches.

	A stream of clear water, a few acres of woodland, a harvest that never lets me down—this is a more fortunate lot, though the glittering lord of fertile Africa is not aware of it. Although Calabrian bees do not bring me honey, and Bacchus does not mellow for me in a Laestrygonian jar,[c dimgray][sup]49[/sup][/c] and I do not have thick fleeces growing in the pastures of Gaul,

The whole flock gambols in the grassy meadow when your day comes round on the fifth of December. The village in festive mood is on holiday in the fields along with the oxen, which are also resting. The wolf wanders among the lambs, and they feel no fear. The forest sheds its woodland leaves in your honour. The digger enjoys beating with his feet in triple time his old enemy, the earth.

	The Scythian plainsmen whose wagons carry their roaming houses in their accustomed way, lead better lives. So do the grim Getae, whose unallotted acres produce crops and corn for all, without charge. They don’t go in for cultivation for more than one year; and when a man has done his stint of work, he is relieved by a successor who has an equal assignment.

	There a woman is kind to her motherless stepchildren and does them no harm; no wife tyrannises over her husband on the strength of her dowry, nor does she place her trust in some sleek adulterer. Their only dowry, and a big one it is, is the upright character they have received from their parents, and the chastity that goes with an unbreakable compact and shies away from someone else’s husband. To sin is utterly forbidden—or else the penalty is death.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Whoever wants to get rid of unholy bloodshed and the madness of civic strife, if he aspires to having Father of Cities inscribed on his statues, oh let him have the courage to curb lawless license. He will be a famous man in future generations; for (shame on us!) we reject virtue when it is alive; then, when it’s removed from our sight, we long to have it back, jealous creatures that we are. What is the point of dismal lamentations if guilt is not checked by punishment? What use are laws, vain as they are without morals, if neither that part of the world which is walled in by blazing heat, nor that quarter which lies next to the North Wind, where the snow is packed hard on the ground, keeps the trader away; if our clever sailors overcome

	If we sincerely repent of our crimes, let us deposit precious stones, jewels, and useless gold, the source of our chief affliction, in the Capitoline temple to which the shouts of approving citizens summon us, or else into the nearest sea. The basic causes of sinful greed must be rubbed out, and minds that are too soft must be hardened in rougher pursuits. The freeborn boy is so green that he doesn’t know how to hold his seat on a horse and is afraid of hunting; he is more skilled at games, whether you ask him to play with a Greek hoop or, if you prefer it, with the dice that are forbidden by law, while his father’s deceitful word of honour defrauds friend, partner, and guest in his eagerness to hand on money to his worthless heir. There’s no doubt about it: shameless wealth continues to grow; yet there is always something missing, making the fortune incomplete.

As soon as she set foot on mighty Crete with its hundred cities, “Father,” she said, “alas for the name of daughter which I have forfeited, and filial devotion overcome by madness! Where have I been, and where have I come to? One death is too light for the sin that girls commit.

Everything else flows away like a river that now glides peacefully in the middle of its channel down to the Etruscan Sea, now rolls along eroded boulders, uprooted trees, livestock and houses all mixed together amid the roar of the mountains and neighbouring woods, when a wild flood enrages its quiet streams. That man will be master of himself and live a happy life who as each day ends can say “I have lived.” Tomorrow let our Father cover the sky in dark cloud or bright sunshine, he will not cancel whatever is past, nor will he render null and void what the flying hour has once carried away. Fortune, revelling in her cruel business, and determined to play her high-handed game, switches her fickle favours, kind now to me, now to someone else. I praise her while she stays, but if she shakes her swift wings, I return her presents, wrap myself in my virtue,[c dimgray][sup]80[/sup][/c] and go in search of honest Poverty, though she brings no dowry.

(I have deferred inquiry as to the origin of the immemorial custom whereby their right hand is armed with an Amazonian axe; nor, indeed, is it permitted to know everything.) But their hordes, which had long been victorious far and wide, were vanquished by the young general’s tactics, and found to their cost what could be done by a mind and character duly nurtured under a divinely favoured roof, and by the fatherly devotion of Augustus to the youthful Neros.[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c]

	The brave are born from the brave and good. Their sires’ valour comes out in young bulls and horses; ferocious eagles do not father timid doves. But training develops innate powers, and the inculcation of what is right strengthens the heart. When sound principles cease to be observed, even the wellborn are disgraced by sin. What you, Rome, owe to the Neros is attested by the river Metaurus, by the overthrow of Hasdrubal, and by that glorious day which, driving the dark clouds away from

That people which, even after Troy’s conflagration and though tossed on Tuscan seas, still valiantly carried its sacred symbols, children, and elderly fathers to the cities of Ausonia, is like an oak buffeted by a hard two-headed axe on Mt Algidus where dark leaves grow thick; in spite of losses, in spite of bloody deaths, it draws strength and courage from the steel itself. Not more persistently did the Hydra grow stronger, the more its body was hacked, to oppose Hercules who chafed at being bested; no greater monster ever came forth from Colchis or Echion’s Thebes.

	You may imagine that these words will perish which I, born by the far-echoing Aufidus, speak to be wedded to the strings of the lyre by an art never before displayed to the public. Yet if Maeonian Homer holds first place, it does not follow that the Muses of Pindar and of Ceos[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c] are forgotten, or those of Alcaeus and Stesichorus, respectively aggressive and august; nor has time eclipsed the fun that Anacreon once enjoyed; and that love still breathes and that passion still lives which the Aeolian girl[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c] confided to the strings of her lyre.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Spartan Helen was not the only one to be set on fire as she gazed at her lover’s neat hair, his gold-embroidered clothes, his royal finery, and his entourage. Nor was Teucer the first to shoot arrows from a Cretan bow. Not once alone was an Ilium besieged, nor did the mighty Idomeneus or Sthenelus alone fight battles worthy to be recounted by the Muses. Nor were fierce Hector and doughty Deiphobus the first to sustain serious wounds in defence of virtuous wife and children. Many a brave man lived before Agamemnon; but all lie buried unwept and unknown in the long night, because they lack a sacred bard. In the grave

	Telephus, the young man whom you are after, belongs to a higher class; he is in the clutches of a girl who is both rich and voluptuous, and he [c dimgray]likes[/c] the fetters that hold him so fast. Phaethon, who was shot down in flames, frightens off dreams of avarice, and the winged Pegasus, who disdained the weight of his earthly rider, Bellerophon,[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c] provides a weighty moral: you should always strive for what is appropriate to yourself; you should avoid an unequal partner, regarding it as wrong to direct your hopes beyond what is permissible.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	The season, Vergil, has brought thirst; but if you are keen to drink the God of Freedom’s juices, pressed at Cales, then you, the client of young nobles, will earn your wine with spikenard.

Shortly after, the elder Nero[c dimgray][sup]36[/sup][/c] fought a bloody battle and, under your happy auspices, routed the savage Raeti. It was a sight to see how, in Mars’ contest, he crushed with utter destruction hearts that were determined to die in freedom. Much like the South Wind as it whips up the wild waves when the Pleiades’ group shines through the torn clouds, he never tired of harassing the squadrons of the foe, and sending his snorting steed through the hottest fires of battle. As the bull-formed Aufidus,[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c] which skirts the kingdom of Apulian Daunus, rolls along, when he goes on the rampage before spreading a terrifying flood over the cultivated farmlands, so Claudius with a huge onslaught broke up the steel-clad lines of the savages, and mowing down front and rear alike littered the ground, gaining victory without loss—and the troops, tactics, and divine assistance were all supplied by you.

May Mother Earth, who is fertile in crops and livestock, present Ceres with a crown of corn; may Jove’s wholesome showers and breezes nourish all that she brings forth.

	If Rome is indeed your creation, if the squadrons that settled the Etruscan shore came from Troy—a remnant bidden to change their home and city in a voyage that brought salvation, for whom the righteous Aeneas, a Trojan survivor, built unscathed through the blazing city a road to freedom,[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] destined, as he was, to give them more than they had left behind—then, o ye gods, give sound character to a young generation enabling them to learn; give rest to the old ensuring their contentment; and to the people of Romulus as a whole give wealth and children and every blessing. What the glorious descendant of Anchises and Venus[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] asks of you with white oxen, may he obtain; may he be victorious in battle over his foes yet merciful once they are down.

Or shall I face these hardships, determined to endure them with the spirit that men ought to show, if they are not weaklings? I [c dimgray]will[/c] endure them, and will follow you with a stout heart across the Alpine peaks and the hostile Caucasus or to the farthest nook of the West. Should you ask how I, who am all too lacking in toughness and pugnacity, can assist your efforts with mine, the answer is that I shall be less apprehensive by your side.

	Do you notice how, as you stride along the Sacred Way in your nine-foot toga, people walking this way and that turn their faces towards you in the most undisguised indignation? “This fellow was flogged with the magistrates’ whip until the crier was weary. Now he ploughs a thousand acres of Falernian land, wears down the Appian Way with his ponies, and sits in the front seats as an important knight, treating Otho’s law with contempt.[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] What’s the point of sending so many ships’ bows beaked with heavy rams against a rabble of brigands and slaves,[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] when this, yes this fellow, is a senior officer?”

	the boy stood there, stripped of everything that showed his age and class, a childish figure that could have softened even the unholy heart of a Thracian. But Canidia, her untidy hair entwined with little snakes, orders wild fig trees to be brought, uprooted from tombs; orders funereal cypresses and eggs smeared with the blood of a hideous toad, the feathers of a nocturnal screech owl, and herbs imported from Iolcos and Hiberia where poisons grow in abundance, and bones snatched from the jaws of a starving bitch—all to be burned in the flames of Colchis.[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] But Sagana, with her dress hitched up, ready for action, sprinkled water from Lake Avernus all through the house, her spiky hair on end like a sea urchin or a charging boar. Veia, inhibited by no sense of guilt, dug a hole in the ground with an iron mattock, grunting with exertion, so that the boy might be buried up to his face (as a swimmer’s body floats with its chin just clear of the water), and suffer a slow death gazing at food that was changed two or three times in the course of the long day. Their intention was that, when his eyeballs had finally rotted away from staring at the forbidden food, his dried-up marrow and liver should be cut out and used as a love charm. Folia from Rimini, with her masculine lusts, did not fail to be present (according to idle Naples and every town in the neighbourhood). She charms

	At this the boy, no longer hoping as before to soften those unholy hags with pathetic appeals, but unsure how to break his silence, finally hurled curses worthy of Thyestes: “Magic poisons have no power to alter right and wrong or to change the vengeance that overtakes men. I shall pursue you with curses; no sacrificial victim can bring release from a terrible malediction. More than that, when I have been forced to die and have breathed my last, I shall haunt you by night as a Fury; my ghost will attack your faces with its hooklike claws—such a power belongs to the spirits of the dead; and I shall squat on your tormented heart, banishing sleep and bringing you terror. In every street, from every side, the crowd will pelt you with stones until they have battered you to death, you filthy hags. Then the wolves and vultures of the Esquiline will scatter your unburied limbs, and my parents, who will, alas, outlive me, will not fail to relish that sight.”

The man may reach Crete, famous for her hundred cities,[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c] though the winds are not in his favour, or he is making for the Syrtes that are buffeted by the South Wind, or else he is carried along over an uncertain sea. Bring larger cups, boy, and pour us Chian or Lesbian wine, or rather Caecuban so that it may check our seasickness. It’s a joy to get rid of our worry and fear for Caesar’s cause with the sweet Loosener’s help.

I hate to recall those parties at which my listlessness and silence and the sighs fetched from the depths of my heart betrayed the man in love. “To think that a poor man’s genuine qualities are powerless against money!”—that was the complaint I would make to you in tears, when I was becoming heated with a fiery wine, and the shameless god drew out my secrets from their hiding place. “But if a liberating rage boiled up in my heart, enabling me to scatter to the winds these thankless remedies that do nothing to heal my wound, my shame would be banished and I would no longer compete with people who are not my equals!” When I had sternly commended this course of action in your presence, you urged me to go home. Instead I made my way with faltering steps to the door that was, alas, utterly unsympathetic, and the threshold that was, alas, so hard that I bruised my hips and pelvis against it to no avail. Now I am enthralled by my passion for Lyciscus, who prides himself on being more softly compliant than any slip of a woman. Neither the frank advice of my friends nor their stern condemnation is able to rescue me. That can be done only by another flame—either a pretty girl or a well-formed boy who ties back his long hair in a knot.

Or again, castigating me for my distaste in cruel words, she says “You’re not so feeble with Inachia as you are with me. You can manage her three times a night; with me you’re too limp for a single session. Damn that woman Lesbia who, when I was looking for a bull, directed me to a passive creature like yourself!

Ah, Neaera, you’ll have good reason to regret my manly spirit!

Let this be our preferred decision (following the precedent of the Phocaean community[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c] which, after swearing a solemn oath, abandoned their lands and ancestral gods, leaving their shrines to be occupied by boars and savage wolves): to go wherever our legs will carry us, wherever the South Wind or the wild Southwester summon us over the waves. Is that your decision? Or does anyone have a better proposal? The omens are favourable; so why don’t we go on board at once? But let us swear this oath: when rocks float up to the surface from the sea’s bed, only then will it be no sin to return. Let us not be loth to put about and sail home, when the Po washes the Matine hilltops or the towering Apennines run into the sea, when a strange affection causes unnatural unions in an unheard-of lust, making tigers eager to couple with deer, and the dove take the kite as a lover; when cattle become trustful, losing their fear of tawny lions, and the goat, no longer shaggy, happily takes to the salt sea. After swearing these oaths and any others that will cut off the prospect of a sweet return, let us be off—the whole community, or at least that part which is superior to the unteachable masses.

	flowers without pruning, where the olive branch never fails to bud, and the dark fig adorns its native tree, where honey oozes from the hollow oak, and the water comes leaping lightly down from the high hills with splashing feet. There the goats come uncalled to the milking pail, and the friendly flock brings home its bulging udders. In the evening no bear comes growling around the sheepfold, nor does the ground swell high with vipers. And we, lucky people that we are, will have still more to marvel at: how there is no wet East Wind to scour the ploughed land with its drenching showers; nor are the fertile seeds scorched in the dry soil; for the king of the gods moderates each extreme. No infections harm the livestock, and the flocks do not swelter under the merciless heat of any star.The craft of pine never strove to reach here, rowed by the Argo’s crew; the shameless Colchian[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c] never set foot here; no sailors of Sidon turned their yardarms in this direction, nor did Ulysses’ toiling comrades. No plague infects the herd, no star’s furious heat scorches the flock. Jove set these shores apart for the righteous race when he debased the golden age with bronze. First with bronze, then with iron, he hardened the generations of men. A blessed escape is offered to their righteous members if they heed me as their seer.

	All right, all right! I yield to the power of your magic, and I humbly beseech you by the kingdom of Proserpine, by the divinity of Diana that must not be provoked, and by those books of spells that can dislodge the stars and call them down from the sky, leave off your awful incantations, Canidia, I beg you, and let the swift wheel that you have set in motion run back, back.

	Telephus prevailed on Nereus’ son,[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c] when in his pride he had marshalled his Mysian troops against him and had attacked him with sharp spears. After the king came out from the city walls and cast himself down, so pathetically, at the feet of the stubborn Achilles,[c dimgray][sup]31[/sup][/c] the Trojan mothers were able to lament the man-slaying Hector who had been consigned to the wild dogs and birds of prey. With Circe’s permission the oarsmen of the much-enduring Ulysses stripped from their limbs the skins that were rough with pigs’ bristles; whereupon their sanity and voice returned, and the former dignity was restored to their faces. You have punished me enough and more than enough, you who are so much loved by sailors and hawkers. My youth and modest complexion have vanished,[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c] leaving my bones covered with yellow skin, while my hair has been turned white by your perfumes. No peace gives me respite

	[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c]Telephus, king of the Mysians, attacked Achilles, whose mother was the Nereid Thetis. He was wounded by Achilles, but the latter was persuaded to heal his wound with the rust of the spear.
	[c dimgray][sup]31[/sup][/c]Priam came out from Troy to recover the body of Hector from Achilles; it was then given decent burial.

Well then, I give in; I believe, poor wretch, what I once denied: that Sabellian spells can make the heart dissolve, and Marsian chants can cause a head to split open. What more do you want? O land and sea, I am burning more fiercely than Hercules, when he was smeared with the inky blood of Nessus,[c dimgray][sup]33[/sup][/c] and the Sicilian fires that never die in boiling Etna. Do you intend to blaze away, a veritable factory of Colchian poisons, until I am reduced to dry ashes and blown away by the wind? How will I end up? What compensation do I owe? Tell me; I shall faithfully pay whatever penalty you demand. I am willing to make atonement with a hundred bullocks, if you so wish; or, if you like, to proclaim on my lying harp: “O chaste and respectable lady, you will walk among the constellations as a golden star.”Though they were incensed at the libelling of Helen, Castor and his mighty brother were won over by prayer and restored to the bard the eyesight they had taken from him.[c dimgray][sup]34[/sup][/c] You, too (for you can if you wish), release me from my madness; you are [c dimgray]not[/c] tarnished by the squalor of your ancestors; you are [c dimgray]not[/c] an old crone who cunningly disturbs the recently buried ashes in the paupers’ ceme­tery;

	[b]I[/b]
	[b]The Race For Wealth And Position[/b]
	The opening Satire serves as a dedication of the whole book to Maecenas, and deals with a conspicuous feature of social life in the Augustan age.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Everybody, says Horace, is discontented with his lot and envies his neighbour. Yet, if some god were to give men a chance to change places, they would all refuse. The cause of this restlessness is the longing for wealth. Men will assure you that the only reason why they, toil unceasingly is that they may secure a competence and then retire. They claim to be like the ant, which provides so wisely for the future; but the ant enjoys its store when winter comes, whereas the money-seeking man never ceases from his labours, so long as there is one richer than himself (1-40).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And yet what is the use of large possessions? If a man has enough, more wealth will prove a burden and a peril. The miser claims that the wealthier he is the more highly will men think of him. I will not argue the point, says Horace, but will leave him to his self-esteem. He is like Tantalus, tortured with thirst though the waters are so near. Your avaricious man suffers all the pain, and enjoys none of the pleasure that money can buy. There is indeed
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 2[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Satires[/b]
	no more certain cause of misery than avarice. Yet one must not run to the other extreme, but should observe the golden mean (41-107).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	To return to the starting-point: everybody is trying to outstrip his neighbour in the race for wealth. People are never satisfied, and therefore we seldom see a man who is ready to quit the banquet of life like a guest who has had enough (108-119).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But enough of this preaching, or you will think that I have rifled the papers of Crispinus (120, 121).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Palmer thinks that this Satire “was probably the last composed of those in the first book,” and Morris speaks of its “maturity of style and treatment.” Campbell, however, points out “distinct signs of immaturity,” such as the Lucretian echo in 11.23-26, a passage which “smacks of the novice in satire-writing” ([c dimgray]cf[/c]. Lucr. i. 936 ff.), the weakness of 1.108, and the “lame conclusion” in 11.120, 121 ([c dimgray]Horace[/c], p. 165). Lejay thinks that our author composed the discussion of [c dimgray]avaritia[/c] (28-117) first, and later, when dedicating his book to Maecenas, added the beginning and the end. This is a very plausible view.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A minute analysis of this Satire is given by Charles Knapp in the [c dimgray]Transactions of the American Philological Association[/c], xlv. pp. 91 ff.

	How comes it, Maecenas, that no man living is content with the lot which either his choice has given him, or chance has thrown in his way, but each has praise for those who follow other paths? “O happy traders!” cries the soldier, as he feels the weight of years, his frame now shattered with hard service. On the other hand, when southern gales toss the ship, the trader cries: “A soldier’s life is better. Do you ask why? There is the battle clash, and in a moment of time comes speedy death or joyous victory.” One learned in law and statutes has praise for the farmer, when towards cockcrow a client comes knocking at his door.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] The man yonder, who has given surety and is dragged into town from the country cries that they only are happy who live in town. The other instances of this kind—so many are they—could tire out the chatterbox Fabius. To be brief with you, hear the conclusion to which I am coming. If some god were to say:[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The reference is not so much to the professional lawyer as to the influential citizen, whose humble clients come at daybreak to ask for advice. Such a citizen would commonly have had a good legal training. With him is contrasted a countryman, who is a defendant in some case and must, therefore, come to the city against his will.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Horace imagines a dramatic scene where a god appears [c dimgray]ex machina. Cf[/c]. [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. ii. 7.24; [c dimgray]Ars Poetica[/c], 191.

Yet she, soon as Aquarius saddens the upturned year,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] stirs out no more but uses the store she gathered beforehand, wise creature that she is; while as for you, neither burning heat, nor winter, fire, sea, sword, can turn you aside from gain—nothing stops you, until no second man be richer than yourself.

Suppose your threshing-floor has threshed out a hundred thousand bushels of grain; your stomach will not on that account hold more than mine: ’tis as if in the slave-gang you by chance should carry the heavy bread-bag on your shoulder, yet you would receive no more than the slave who carries nothing.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]49[/sup][/c]Or, tell me, what odds does it make to the man who lives within Nature’s bounds, whether he ploughs a hundred acres or a thousand? “But what a pleasure to take from a large heap!” So long as you let us take just as much from our little one, why praise your granaries above our bins? It is as if you needed no more than a jug or a cup of water, and were to say, “I’d rather have taken the quantity from a broad river than from this tiny brook.” So it comes about that when any find pleasure in undue abundance, raging Aufidus sweeps them away, bank and all; while the man who craves only so much as he needs, neither draws water thick with mud, nor loses his life in the flood.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

You sleep with open mouth on money-bags piled up from all sides, and must perforce keep hands off as if they were hallowed, or take delight in them as if painted pictures. Don’t you know what money is for, what end it serves? You may buy bread, greens, a measure of wine, and such other things as would mean pain to our human nature, if withheld. What, to lie awake half-dead with fear, to be in terror night and day of wicked thieves, of fire, of slaves, who may rob you and run away—is this so pleasant? In such blessings I could wish ever to be poorest of the poor.

Can you wonder, when you put money above all else, that nobody pays you the love you do not earn? Or, when Nature gives you kinsfolk without trouble, if you sought to hold and keep their love, would it be as fruitless a waste of effort, as if one were to train an ass to race upon the Campus [c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] obedient to the rein?

	[b]The Folly Of Running To Extremes[/b]
	Men seldom keep the golden mean, but run from one extreme to another. Especially may this be illustrated by victims of sensual indulgence and by people guilty of adultery, a vice which has become a shocking feature of the age.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This immature and forbidding sketch, coarse and sensational in tone, and doubtless one of Horace’s earliest efforts, is closely associated with the Lucilian type of satire. It abounds in personalities, freely handled, and Horace himself (in [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. i. 4.92) cites it later as an illustration of the kind of writing which had aroused enmity against the author. Even Maecenas, if we are to believe the scholiasts, is thinly disguised in the Maltinus of 1.25.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In his introduction to this Satire, Lejay has shown how dependent it ultimately is “upon the erotic literature of the Hellenistic period as expressed in the popular Cynic philosophy, in the New Comedy, and in the [c dimgray]Anthology[/c]” (Fiske, p. 251). There is a striking parallel between it and a poem on love in the [c dimgray]Oxyrhynchus Papyri[/c] by the Cynic Cercidas of Megalopolis, who lived in the latter part of the third century b.c. See Chapter I. of Powell and Barber’s [c dimgray]New Chapters in the History of Greek Literature[/c] (Oxford, 1921).

	Satire II
	The flute-girls’ guilds, the drug-quacks, beggars, actresses, buffoons, and all that breed, are in grief and mourning at the death of the singer Tigellius. He was, they say, so generous. On the other hand, here’s one who, fearing to be called a prodigal, would grudge a poor friend the wherewithal to banish cold and hunger’s pangs. Should you ask another why, in his thankless gluttony, he recklessly strips the noble estate of his sire and grandsire, buying up every dainty with borrowed money, he answers that it is because he would not like to be thought mean and of poor spirit. He is praised by some, blamed by others. Fufidius, rich in lands, rich in moneys laid out at usury, fears the repute of a worthless prodigal; five times the interest he slices away from the principal,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and the nearer a man is to ruin, the harder he presses him; he aims to get notes-of-hand from youths who have just donned the toga of manhood, and have stern fathers. “Great Jove!” who does not cry as soon as he hears it? “but surely he spends on himself in proportion to his gains?” You would hardly believe
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The usual rate was one per cent a month, twelve per cent a year, but Fufidius charged five times that rate, and took it in advance as in discounting, so that the sum actually received by the borrower was only forty per cent of the amount borrowed.

There is no middle course. Some men would deal only with women whose ankles are hidden by a robe with low-hanging flounce;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] another is found only with such as live in a foul brothel. When from such a place a man he knew was coming forth, “A blessing on thy well-doing i” runs Cato’s revered utterance; “for when shameful passion has Swelled the veins,’tis well that young men come down hither, rather than tamper with other men’s wives.” “I should not care to be praised on that count,” says Cupiennius, an admirer of white-robed lechery.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

Yet he, if he wished to be good and generous, so far as his means and reason would direct, and so far as one might be liberal in moderation, would give a sum sufficient, not such as would mean for him shame and ruin. But no; because of this one thing he hugs himself, admires and plumes himself, because, says he, “I meddle with no matron.” Just as was once said by Marsaeus, Origo’s well-known lover, who gave his paternal home and farm to an actress: “Never may I have dealings with other men’s wives!” But you have with actresses and with courtesans, through whom your name loses more than does your estate. Or is it enough for you to avoid the rôle,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] but not the thing, which in any case works harm?

	his passion’s behalf; “What wouldst thou? Do I ever, when my rage is at its worst, ask you for a dame clad in a stola,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] the offspring of a great consul?” What would he answer? “The girl is a noble father’s child.” But how much better—how utterly at variance with this—is the course that nature, rich in her own resources, prompts, if you would only manage wisely, and not confound what is to be avoided with what is to be desired! Do you think it makes no difference, whether your trouble is due to your own fault or to circumstances? Wherefore, that you may have no reason to repent, cease to court matrons, for thence one may derive pain and misery, rather than reap enjoyment in the reality. Though this may not be your opinion, Cerinthus, yet not softer or finer are a woman’s limbs amidst snowy pearls and green emeralds—nay, often the advantage is with the strumpet. She, moreover, presents her wares without disguise; what she has for sale she openly displays; and if she has some charm, she does not boastfully show it off, while carefully concealing all unsightliness. This is the way with the rich when they buy horses; they inspect them covered, so that if a beautiful shape, as often, is supported by a tender hoof, it may not take in the buyer, as he gapes at the comely haunches, the small head, the stately neck. In this they act wisely.

	but there are thin hips, a long nose, a short waist and a long foot. In a matron one can see only her face, for unless she be a Catia, her long robe conceals all else. But if you seek forbidden charms that are invested with a rampart—for this it is that drives you crazy—many obstacles will then be in your way—attendants, the sedan, hairdressers, parasites, the robe dropping to the ankles, and, covered with a wrap, a thousand things which hinder you from a clear view. In the other—no obstacle. In her Coan silk[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] you may see her, almost as if naked, so that she may not have a poor leg, an unsightly foot; you may measure her whole form with your eye. Or would you rather have a trick played upon you and your money extorted before the wares are shown? The gallant sings how[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] “the huntsman pursues the hare mid the deep snow, but declines to touch it when thus outstretched,” and adds: “My love is like unto this, for it passes over what is served to all, and chases flying game.” Do you suppose that with verses such as these, sorrow and passion and the burden of care can be lifted from your breast?

The Greek runs thus:

I should not, for the pleasures I love are those easy to attain. “By and by,” “Nay more,” “If my husband goes out”—a woman who speaks thus is for the Galli,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] says Philodemus; for himself he asks for one who is neither high-priced nor slow to come when bidden. She must be fair and straight, and only so far arranged that she will not wish to seem taller or fairer than nature allows. When she and I embrace, she is to me an Ilia or an Egeria[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]: I give her any name. No fears have I in her company, that a husband may rush back from the country, the door burst open, the dog bark, the house ring through and through with the din and clatter of his knocking; that the woman, white as a sheet, will leap away, the maid in league with her cry out in terror, she fearing for her limbs, her guilty mistress for her dowry, and I for myself. With clothes dishevelled and bare of foot, I must run off, dreading disaster in purse or person or at least repute.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires I[/b][/c]
	[b]III[/b]
	[b]On Mutual Forbearance[/b]
	The connexion between this satire and the preceding one is indicated at the outset, for the musician Tigellius is again introduced as a person who well illustrates the foibles and inconsistencies of a large class of people. But, says Horace, some one may ask me, “Have you yourself no faults?” Yes, I have, though they may not be as bad as his. I trust I am not like Maenius, who laid bare the faults of others, but overlooked his own. Self-satisfaction of this sort well deserves to be satirized. A man should examine himself and search out his own faults before criticizing others (1-37).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Think how blind is the lover to the defects of his beloved, or how tenderly a fond father treats his child’s deformities. Even so we should be indulgent to the weaknesses of our friends. On the contrary, we often look upon real virtues as faults, calling for example modest behaviour stupidity, and simplicity boorishness. We must exercise mutual forbearance and also discriminate between failings, for a mere impropriety is not as serious as a heinous crime (38-95).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In fact the Stoic paradox that all offences are equal, “omnia peccata paria esse” (Cicero, [c dimgray]De finibus[/c],
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 30[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires I[/b][/c]
	iv. 19.55), besides being repugnant to common sense, is historically unsound, our social ethics being the result of a process of evolution. Yet your Stoic would punish all offences alike, if he were a king (96-124).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“If he were a king,” did I say? Why, according to another of his paradoxes, the Stoic is already a king, even as he is rich and handsome and everything else that is good. “Yes,” he would explain, “I am a king potentially, even as Hermogenes is a singer, though he does not open his lips.” “Well,” replies Horace,” I cannot see that your crown wins you esteem or saves you from ill-treatment. For myself, not being a philosopher, I will remain a private citizen, and live on terms of mutual forbearance with others” (124-142).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In striking contrast with Satire II., this one is kindly and genial in tone, and it would seem that the author was disarming criticism by his assurance that he was not disposed to be over-censorious, as we learn from 11.63 ff. Horace has now become acquainted with Maecenas, and this improvement in his worldly prospects may to some extent account for the change of tone, and the doffing of the severity of Lucilian invective.

	All singers have this fault: if asked to sing among their friends they are never so inclined; if unasked, they never leave off. That son of Sardinia, Tigellius, was of this sort. If Caesar, who might have forced him to comply, should beg him by his father’s friendship and his own, he could make no headway. If the man took the fancy, then from the egg-course to the fruit[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] he would keep chanting “Io Bacche!”[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] now with highest voice and now with one responding in lowest pitch to the tetrachord.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] There was nothing consistent in the fellow. Often he would run as if fleeing from a foe; very often he would stalk as slowly as some bearer of Juno’s holy offerings.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Often he would keep two hundred slaves, often only ten. Now he would talk of kings and tetrarchs, everything grand, and now he’d say, “Give me a three-legged table, a shell of clean salt, and a coat that, however coarse, can keep out the cold.” Suppose you had given a million[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] to this thrifty gentleman, contented with so little; in a week there was nothing in his pockets. All night, till dawn, he would stay awake; all day would snore. Never was a creature so inconsistent.

	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c]Now someone may say to me: “What about yourself? Have you no faults?” Why yes, but not the same, and perhaps lesser ones. When Maenius once was carping at Novius behind his back, “Look out, sir,” said someone, “do you not know yourself? Or do you think you impose on us, as one we do not know?” “I take no note of myself,” said Maenius. Such self-love is foolish and shameless, and deserves to be censured.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c]When you look over your own sins, your eyes are rheumy and daubed with ointment; why, when you view the failings of your friends, are you as keen of sight as an eagle or as a serpent of Epidaurus[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]? But, on the other hand, the result for you is that they, too, in turn peer into [c dimgray]your[/c] faults.

He might awake a smile because his hair is cut in country style, his toga sits ill, and his loose shoe will hardly stay on his foot.”[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] But he’s a good man, none better; but he’s your friend; but under that uncouth frame are hidden great gifts. In a word, give yourself a shaking and see whether nature, or haply some bad habit, has not at some time sown in you the seeds of folly; for in neglected fields there springs up bracken, which you must burn.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]38[/sup][/c]Let us turn first to this fact, that the lover, in his blindness, fails to see his lady’s unsightly blemishes, nay is even charmed with them, as was Balbinus with Hagna’s wen. I could wish that we made the like mistake in friendship and that to such an error our ethics had given an honourable name. At any

	rate, we should deal with a friend as a father with his child, and not be disgusted at some blemish. If a boy squints, his father calls him “Blinky”; if his son is sadly puny, like misbegotten Sisyphus of former days, he styles him “Chickabiddy.” One with crooked legs he fondly calls “Cruikshank,” and one that can hardly stand on twisted ankles, “Curly-legs.”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Is a friend somewhat close? Let us call him thrifty. Does another fail in tact and show off a bit too much? He wants his friends to think him agreeable. Or is he somewhat bluff and too outspoken? Let him pass for frank and fearless. Hotheaded is he? Let him be counted a man of spirit. This, I take it, is how to make friends, and to keep them when made. But we turn virtues themselves upside down, and want to soil a clean vessel. Does there live among us an honest soul, a truly modest fellow? We nickname him slow and stupid. Does another shun every snare and offer no exposed side to malice, seeing that we live in that kind of a world where keen envy and slanders are so rife? Instead of his good sense and prudence we speak of his craftiness and insincerity. Is one somewhat simple and such as often I have freely shown myself to you, Maecenas, interrupting you perhaps while reading or thinking with some annoying chatter?” He is quite devoid of social tact,”[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] we say. Ah, how

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The pet names used, viz. [c dimgray]paetus, pullus, varus, scaurus[/c], are all adjectives denoting a less objectionable form of the defect referred to, but they were also [c dimgray]cognomina[/c] in well-known family names. “Paetus” is associated with the Aelii and Papirii, “Pullus” with the Fabii and the lunii, “Varus” with the Quintilii, and “Scaurus” with the Aemilii and Aurelii. For the passage as a whole we may compare Plato, [c dimgray]Rep[/c]. v. 474 D, Lucretius, iv. 1160 ff., Ovid, [c dimgray]Ars Am[/c]. ii. 657; and among modern writers, Molière, [c dimgray]Misanthrope[/c], Act ii.

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The expression [c dimgray]communis sensus[/c] does not mean precisely the same as the phrase we have derived from it, viz. “common sense.” It is rather social sense, a sense of propriety in dealing with our fellows, or what the French call [c dimgray]savoir faire[/c].

	lightly do we set up an unjust law to our own harm; For no living wight is without faults: the best is he who is burdened with the least. My kindly friend must, as is fair, weigh my virtues against my faults, if he wishes to gain my love, and must turn the scales in their favour as being the more numerous—if only my virtues are the more numerous. On that condition he shall be weighed in the same scale. One who expects his friend not to be offended by his own warts will pardon the other’s pimples. It is but fair that one who craves indulgence for failings should grant it in return.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]76[/sup][/c] In fine, since the fault of anger, and all the other faults that cleave to fools[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] cannot be wholly cut away, why does not Reason use her own weights and measures, and visit offences with punishment suited to each? If one were to crucify a slave who, when bidden to take away a dish, has greedily licked up the half-eaten fish and its sauce, now cold, sane men would call him more insane than Labeo.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] How much madder and grosser a sin is this: a friend has committed a slight offence, which you would be thought ungracious not to pardon; you hate him bitterly and shun him, as Ruso is shunned by his debtor, who, poor wretch, if at the coming of the sad Kalends he cannot scrape up from some quarter either interest or principal, must offer his throat like a prisoner of war and listen to his captor’s dreary histories![c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] What if in his cups my friend has wet the couch or knocked off the table a bowl once

	fingered by Evander,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] is he for such offence, ot because when hungry he snatched up first a pullet served on my side of the dish, to be less pleasing in my eyes? What shall I do if he commits a theft, or betrays a trust, or disowns his bond? Those whose creed is that all sins are much on a par[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] are at a loss when they come to face facts.

	[c dimgray][sup]99[/sup][/c]When living creatures[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] crawled forth upon primeval earth, dumb, shapeless beasts, they fought for their acorns and lairs with nails and fists, then with clubs, and so on step by step with the weapons which need had later forged, until they found words and names[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] wherewith to give meaning to their cries and feelings. Thenceforth they began to cease from war, to build towns, and to frame laws that none should thieve or rob or commit adultery. For before Helen’s day a wench was the most dreadful cause of war, but deaths unknown to fame were theirs whom, snatching fickle love in wild-beast fashion, a man stronger in might struck down, like the bull in a herd. If you will but turn over the annals and records of the world, you must needs confess that justice was born of the fear of injustice[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] Between right and wrong Nature can draw no such distinction as between things gainful and harmful, what is to be sought and what is to be shunned; nor will Reason ever prove this, that the sin is one and the

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The sixth Stoic Paradox according to Cicero, is “solum sapientem esse divitem.” The Stoics held that the truly wise man or philosopher was perfect: he was therefore rich, as well as beautiful, accomplished, and a king among men.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires I[/b][/c]
	[b]IV[/b]
	[b]A Defence Of Satire[/b]
	The writers of Old Attic Comedy assailed the vicious with the utmost freedom. In Roman literature, Lucilius shows the same spirit and boldness, but his metrical forms are different, and his verse is uncouth. He was careless and verbose, more interested in the quantity than in the quality of his work (1-13).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Similar in this last respect is Crispinus, who challenges the poet to a scribbling contest, but Horace declines to compete with such poetasters, even as he refuses to emulate the self-satisfied Fannius by reading his verses in public, because this kind of writing is not popular. Men do not like to have their weaknesses exposed. “Give such a poet a wide berth,” they cry (14-38).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“Listen to my defence,” says Horace. “In the first place, a man who composes verses as I do, verses that are really more like conversation, should not be called a poet. The true poet has imaginative power and lofty utterance. This is why the question has been raised whether comedy is poetry, for even in its most spirited passages, as rendered on the stage, we are really dealing with pure conversation, such as would be suitable to similar scenes in daily life” (38-56).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“So it is with the verses of Lucilius and my own. Take away the metrical element, change the word-order, and you have plain prose. But the question whether satire is poetry must be postponed. At present let us consider the question of its unpopularity” (56-65).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 46[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires I[/b][/c]
	“You look upon me as an informer, but even if you are a rogue I am no informer. My friends will acquit me of such a charge. I am not writing for the general public, and my object is not to give pain. Yet it is my habit to observe the conduct of others, and to profit thereby, for I was trained to do so by my father, and have always continued the practice. To be sure, I jot down my thoughts, but what of that? Nowadays everybody writes, and you, my critic, willy-nilly, will take to writing yourself” (65-143).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	On the appearance of his first [c dimgray]Satires[/c] (and it is to be noticed that the carefully chosen subjunctive [c dimgray]habeat[/c] in 1.71 does not preclude their publication), the poet’s critics had accused Horace of being a malevolent scandal-monger. They also contrasted him unfavourably with Lucilius, who in his open warfare used the weapons of Old Comedy, was familiar with the Greek moralists and philosophers, and had the pen of a ready writer. In his reply, Horace maintains that his own satire is not personal, but rather social and general in its application. He does not indulge in the invective of Old Comedy, but rather follows the New in spirit as well as in style. His teacher in morals, if not a great philosopher ([c dimgray]cf[/c]. [c dimgray]sapiens[/c], 1, 115), was a representative of the fine, old-fashioned Roman virtues, even his own father. As for the copiousness of Lucilius, that was his predecessor’s chief fault, which he himself would carefully avoid.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This is one of the early Satires, and in view of the citation in 1.92 is to be associated closely with the Second. As there is no reference to Maecenas, it was probably composed before the poet’s introduction to the statesman in 38 b.c.

	Eupolis and Cratinus and Aristophanes, true poets,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and the other good men to whom Old Comedy belongs, if there was anyone deserving to be drawn as a rogue and thief, as a rake or cut-throat, or as scandalous in any other way, set their mark upon him with great freedom. It is on these that Lucilius wholly hangs; these he has followed, changing only metre and rhythm. Witty he was, and of keen-scented nostrils, but harsh in framing his verse. Herein lay his fault: often in an hour, as though a great exploit, he would dictate two hundred lines while standing, as they say, on one foot.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] In his muddy stream there was much that you would like to remove. He was wordy, and too lazy to put up with the trouble of writing—of writing correctly, I mean; for as to quantity, I let that pass. See, Crispinus challenges me at long odds[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]: “Take your tablets, please; I’ll take mine. Let a place be fixed for us, and time and judges; let us see which can write the most.” The gods be praised for fashioning me of meagre wit and lowly spirit, of rare and scanty speech! But do you, for such is your taste, be like the air shut up in goat-skin bellows, and ever puffing away until the fire softens the iron.

Choose anyone from amid a crowd: he is suffering either from avarice or some wretched ambition. One is mad with love for somebody’s wife, another for boys. Here is one whose fancy the sheen of silver catches; Albius[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] dotes on bronzes; another trades his wares from the rising sun to regions warmed by his evening rays; nay, through perils he rushes headlong, like dust gathered up by a whirlwind, fearful lest he lose aught of his total, or fail to add to his wealth. All of these dread verses and detest the poet: “He carries hay on his horns,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] give him a wide berth. Provided he can raise a laugh for himself, he will spare not a single friend, and whatever he has once scribbled on his sheets he will rejoice to have all know, all the slaves and old dames as they come home from bakehouse and pond.”[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Fannius, a petty poet, brought his writings (kept in [c dimgray]capsae[/c] or cylindrical boxes), together with his portrait, into prominence, but in what way he did so is now unknown. Probably he presented them to private libraries. At this time the only public library in Rome was the one founded by Asinius Pollio in 38 b.c, and the only living writer whose works were admitted to it was Varro.

	akin to prose. If one has gifts inborn, if one has a soul divine and tongue of noble utterance, to such give the honour of that name. Hence some have questioned whether Comedy is or is not poetry; for neither in diction nor in matter has it the fire and force of inspiration, and, save that it differs from prose-talk in its regular beat, it is mere prose. “But,” you say, “there is the father storming in passion because his spendthrift son, madly in love with a wanton mistress, rejects a wife with large dower, and in drunken fit reels abroad—sad scandal—with torches in broad daylight.” Would Pomponius hear a lecture less stern than this, were his father alive?[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] And so ’tis not enough to write out a line of simple words such that, should you break it up, any father whatever would rage in the same fashion as the father in the play. Take from the verses which I am writing now, or which Lucilius wrote in former days, their regular beat and rhythm—change the order of the words, transposing the first and the last—and it would not be like breaking up:

Often on each of the three couches you may see four at dinner,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] among whom one loves to bespatter in any way everyone present except the host who provides the water, and later him as well, when he has well drunk and the truth ful god of free speech[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] unlocks the heart’s secrets

Your philosopher will give you theories for shunning or seeking this or that: enough for me, if I can uphold the rule our fathers have handed down, and if, so long as you need a guardian, I can keep your health and name from harm. When years have brought strength to body, and mind, you will swim without the cork.” With words like these would he mould my boyhood; and whether he were advising me to do something, “You have an example for so doing,” he would say, and point to one of the special judges;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] or were forbidding me, “Can you doubt whether this is dishonourable and disadvantageous or not, when so and so stands in the blaze of ill repute?” As a neighbour’s funeral scares gluttons when sick, and makes them, through fear of death, careful of themselves, so the tender mind is oft deterred from vice by another’s shame.

	[b]V[/b]
	[b]A Journey To Brundisium[/b]
	This Satire is modelled upon one by Lucilius, who in his third book had described a journey from Rome to Capua and thence to the Sicilian straits.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Horace’s journey was associated with an embassy on which Maecenas and others were sent in 38 b.c. by Octavian, to make terms with Marcus Antonius, who, notwithstanding the so-called treaty of Brundisium, made between the rivals of two years earlier, was again somewhat estranged.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The travellers left Rome by the Appian Way, and made a night-journey from Appii Forum to Anxur by canal-boat through the Pomptine marshes. From Capua their road took them over the Apennines into the Apulian hill-country of Horace’s birth, whence they passed on to Italy’s eastern coast, reaching Brundisium in fifteen days. The journey had been pursued in a leisurely fashion, for if necessary it might have been covered in less than half that time.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Although the mission of Maecenas was a political one, Horace steers clear of political gossip. The account reads like a compilation of scanty notes from a diary, and yet leaves a delightful impression about the personal relations of men distinguished in literature and statesmanship. Some of the character­istics
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 62[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires I[/b][/c]
	of the sketch are doubtless due to Horace’s adherence to the satiric type. Thus the encounter of the two buffoons (51-69) is a dramatic scene, treated in a mock-heroic fashion, where the comparison made between Sarmentus and a unicorn recalls the Lucilian description of a rhinoceros with a projecting tooth,
	[m1]\ [/m]

	dente adverso eminulo hic est
	rinoceros
	(117 f. ed. Marx.)
	[m1]\ [/m]
	while the four disfiguring lines (82-85) are parallel to a similar incident recorded by Lucilius. This close dependence of Horace upon Lucilius throughout is clearly shown both by Lejay, in his introduction to this Satire, and by Fiske in his [c dimgray]Lucilius and Horace[/c], pp. 306 ff.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Professor Tenney Frank, in [c dimgray]Classical Philology[/c], xv. (1920) p. 393, has made the plausible suggestion that Heliodorus, the [c dimgray]rhetor, Graecorum longe doctissimus[/c], of 11.2 and 3, is really Apollodorus, who was chosen by Julius Caesar to be the teacher of Octavian, and who is called by Wilamowitz “the founder of the classical school of Augustan poetry.” The name Apollodorus cannot be used in hexameters, and Helios would be an easy substitution for Apollo. This scholar would have been a not unworthy member of the distinguished literary group who accompanied Maecenas to Brundisium.

	Leaving mighty Rome, I found shelter in a modest inn at Aricia, having for companion Heliodorus the rhetorician, far most learned of all Greeks. Next came Appii Forum,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] crammed with boatmen and stingy tavern-keepers. This stretch[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] we lazily cut in two, though smarter travellers make it in a single day: the Appian Way is less tiring, if taken slowly.

Burning charcoal is carried before him, probably in case some ceremonial sacrifice is seen to be appropriate on the occasion of this visit of Maecenas.

Next, at Capua, our mules lay aside their saddle-bags at an early hour. Maecenas goes off to ball-playing, Virgil and I to sleep, for such play is hard on the sore-eyed and the dyspeptic. Another stage, and we are taken in at the well-stocked villa of Cocceius, lying above the inns of Caudium.

	[c dimgray][sup]51[/sup][/c]Now, O Muse, recount in brief the contest of Sarmentus the jester and Messius Cicirrus, and the lineage of the two who engaged in the fray.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Messius was of famous stock, an Oscan; the mistress of Sarmentus is still living: from such ancestry sprung,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] they entered the lists. And first Sarmentus: “You, I say, are like a wild horse.” We laugh, and Messius himself, “I grant you,” and tosses his head. “Oh!’ says Sarmentus, “if only the horn had not been cut out of your forehead, what would you do, when you can threaten, thus dehorned?” Now an unsightly scar had disfigured the left side of his bristly brow. With many a joke on his Campanian disease[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and on his face, he begged him to dance the Cyclops shepherd-dance: he would need neither mask nor

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The [c dimgray]villula[/c] was probably a small house built for the convenience of persons travelling on public business, where officers were stationed whose duty it was to provide ordinary necessaries. For these officers Horace uses a Greek word ([c dimgray]parochi[/c] from παρέχειν), the regular Latin word, according to Porphyrio, being [c dimgray]copiarii[/c].
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]In mock-heroic style Horace describes a battle of wit between two buffoons, one of whom, Sarmentus, is a freedman of Maecenas, while the other, Cicirrus, or “game-cock,” is of the native Oscan stock of Samnium.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The scholiast on Juvenal, [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. v. 3, tells us that a certain Sarmentus had been a slave, who on the proscription and death of his master Favonius had been bought by Maecenas and set free. If the Sarmentus of this scene is the same man, the [c dimgray]domina[/c] is the widow of Favonius.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]The scholiast in Cruquius explains this of warts, which left scars when removed.

Then Gnatia, built under the wrath of the waternymphs,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] brought us laughter and mirth in its effort to convince us that frankincense melts without fire at the temple’s threshold. Apella, the Jew,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] may believe it, not I; for I “have learned that the gods lead a care-free life,”[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and if Nature works any marvel, the gods do not send it down from their heavenly home aloft when in surly mood[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]!

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]This implies that Gnatia had no springs. Pliny ([c dimgray]N.H[/c]. ii. 111) mentions the miracle of wood, placed on a sacred stone, taking fire spontaneously. The stone would seem to have been at the entrance of a temple.

	[b]VI[/b]
	[b]On Social And Political Amition[/b]
	This Satire, addressed to the poet’s patron, is mainly autobiographical. Horace, now an intimate friend of Maecenas, has become an object of suspicion and envy to many people whose social and political aspirations were unsatisfied. He therefore disclaims such ambition for himself, sets forth the principles upon which Maecenas chooses his friends, and pays a noble tribute to his own father, to whom he is indebted for all that he is, both in character and education. Himself the son of a freedman, he has no wish to change places with a man of patrician birth. As it is, he lives a simple and care-free life, and is far more happy than if he had the burden of noble ancestry on his shoulders.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As this interesting Satire contains no allusion to the Sabine farm, it was probably composed before 33 b.c., the year when Maecenas presented him with the estate. In its subject and treatment it is to be grouped with the third, fourth, and tenth Satires. It is at once a defence of Maecenas, who did not look down upon men of lowly birth, and of the poet himself, who is not ashamed of his humble origin, but is proud of his freedman father, who had given him the intellectual and moral training which won for him a place in the circle of his patron.

	Though of all the Lydians that are settled in Tuscan lands none is of nobler birth than you,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and though grandsires of yours, on your mother’s and father’s side alike, commanded mighty legions in days of old, yet you, Maecenas, do not, like most of the world, curl up your nose at men of unknown birth, men like myself, a freedman’s son.

What good was it to you, Tillius, to assume the stripe once doffed and become a tribune?[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Envy fastened on you afresh, but would be less, were you in a private station. For as soon as any man is so crazy as to bind the black thongs half way up his leg,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and to drop the broad stripe down his breast, at once he hears: “What fellow is this? What was his father?” Just as, if one should suffer from the same malady as Barrus, and long to be thought handsome, then wherever he went he would make the girls eager to ask about details—what his face was like, his ankle, his foot, his teeth, his hair: so he who takes it upon himself to look after his fellow-citizens and the city, the empire and Italy and the temples of the gods, compels all the world to take an interest, and to ask who was his father, and whether he is dishonoured through an unknown mother. “Do you, the son of a Syrus, a Dama, a Dionysius,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] dare to fling from the rock[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] or to hand over to Cadmus citizens of Rome?” “But,” you say, “Novius, my colleague, sits one row

Fortunate I could not call myself as having won your friendship by some chance; for’twas no case of luck throwing you in my way; that best of men, Virgil, some time ago, and after him Varius, told you what manner of man I was. On coming into your presence I said a few faltering words, for speechless shame stopped me from saying more. My tale was not that I was a famous father’s son, not that I rode about my estate on a Saturian[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] steed: I told you what I was. As is your way, you answered little and I withdrew; then, nine months later, you sent for me again and bade me join your friends. I count it a great honour that I pleased you, who discern between fair and foul, not by a father’s fame, but by blamelessness of life and heart.

	even as you might find fault with moles spotted over a comely person—if no one will justly lay to my charge avarice or meanness or lewdness; if, to venture on self-praise, my life is free from stain and guilt and I am loved by my friends—I owe this to my father, who, though poor with a starveling farm, would not send me to the school of Flavius, to which grand boys used to go, sons of grand centurions, with slate and satchel slung over the left arm, each carrying his eightpence on the Ides[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] — nay, he boldly took his boy off to Rome, to be taught those studies that any knight or senator would have his own offspring taught. Anyone who saw my clothes and attendant slaves—as is the way in a great city[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—would have thought that such expense was met from ancestral wealth. He himself, a guardian true and tried, went with me among all my teachers. Need I say more? He kept me chaste—and that is virtue’s first grace— free not only from every deed of shame, but from all scandal. He had no fear that some day, if I should follow a small trade as crier or like himself as tax-collector, somebody would count this to his discredit. Nor should I have made complaint, but, as it is, for this I owe him praise and thanks the more.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]89[/sup][/c]Never while in my senses could I be ashamed of such a father, and so I will not defend myself, as would a goodly number, who say it is no fault of theirs that they have not free-born and famous parents. Far different from this is what I say and what I think:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The pupils paid their small school fee on the Ides of each month. The reading [c dimgray]octonis[/c] would imply that the school-year lasted eight months.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]I take this to mean that on going to Rome Horace’s father did as the Romans did. At Venusia Horace would have gone unattended, carrying his own books. Some, however, take the words [c dimgray]in magno ut populo[/c] with [c dimgray]vidisset[/c], [c dimgray]i[/c].[c dimgray]e[/c]. “had anyone noticed—so far as one could notice such things in a great throng.”

For at once I should have to enlarge my means, to welcome more callers, to take one or two in my company so as not to go abroad or into the country alone; I should have to keep more pages and ponies, and take a train of wagons. To-day, if I will, I may go on a bob-tailed mule even to Tarentum, the saddle-bag’s weight galling his loins, and the rider his withers. No one will taunt me with meanness as he does you, praetor Tillius,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] when on the Tibur road five slaves follow you, carrying a commode and case of wine.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]A statue of the Satyr Marsyas stood in the Forum near the praetor’s tribunal. The usurer Novius had his table near by and so gives the poet an opportunity to put his own interpretation on the attitude or facial expression of Marsyas, who, after defeat in a musical contest with Apollo, was flayed alive. Extant copies of Myron’s Marsyas show him with right hand uplifted and a face expressive of pain.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The [c dimgray]trigo[/c] was a game of ball in which [c dimgray]three[/c] players took part. The phrase [c dimgray]lusum trigonem[/c] means properly “the playing of ball,” and implies a transitive use [c dimgray]of ludere[/c] ([c dimgray]cf[/c]. “post decisa negotia,” [c dimgray]Ep[/c]. i. 7.59; also [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. ii. 3.248).

	The incident recorded here occurred, probably in 43 b.c., at Clazomenae in Asia Minor, when Brutus, as propraetor of the Province, was holding court, and Horace was serving as tribune in his army. The poem gives us a single scene, a battle of wit between two litigants, Rupilius Rex, of Praeneste, a man proscribed by Antony and Octavius, and Persius, a half-Greek, half-Roman merchant of Clazomenae. The main point of the story is found in Persius’ pun on the name Rex (king), which he cleverly links up with the propraetor and the propraetor’s most famous ancestor. The latter had driven out of Rome the ancient Tarquin kings, and Brutus himself had slain Caesar.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This little poem, similar, perhaps, to the farcical and dramatic scenes of early [c dimgray]Satura[/c], is probably the first of Horace’s [c dimgray]Sermones[/c], and must have been composed before the battle of Philippi (42 b.c), and the tragic death of Brutus.

	[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c]Persius sets forth his case: all the assembly laugh. He praises Brutus, he praises his staff.

On he rushed like some winter torrent, whither the axe is seldom borne.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Then, in answer to his full flood of wit, the man of Praeneste flings back abuse, the very essence of the vineyard, like some vine-dresser, tough and invincible, to whom the wayfarer has often had to yield, when loudly hooting at him “Cuckoo!”[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c]But the Greek Persius, now soused with Italian vinegar, cries out: “By the great gods, I implore you, O Brutus, since it is in your line to take off “kings,” why not behead this Rex?[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] This, believe me, is a task meet for you.”

	[b]How Priapus Put Witches to Rout[/b]
	Horace lays the scene of this incident in that part of the Esquiline which lay outside the famous [c dimgray]Agger[/c], or Mound of Servius, on the north-east side of Rome. In this district there had long been a burial-place, used especially for criminals and paupers, where, among the tombs, witches practised their weird and infernal rites. Here, however, Maecenas, co-operating with Augustus in the work of city improvement, had laid out beautiful gardens, in which he later built himself a palace with a conspicuous tower.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The incident must be supposed to have occurred before the transformation from a squalid and repulsive site had been completed. A wooden statue, however, of Priapus, the god of gardens, had already been set up.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The gruesome story of the witches’ incantations comes to a ridiculous end when the wood of the statue cracked, and the noise of the explosion drove the hags away in terror.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Satire is closely connected in subject with Epodes 5 and 17. Virgil’s eighth Eclogue may also be compared, as well as the three [c dimgray]Priapea[/c] to be found among the minor poems attributed to Virgil.

	Once I was a fig-wood stem, a worthless log, when the carpenter, doubtful whether to make a stool or a Priapus, chose that I be a god.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] A god, then, I became, of thieves and birds the special terror[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; for thieves my right hand keeps in check, and this red stake, protruding from unsightly groin; while for the mischievous birds, a reed set on my head affrights them and keeps them from lighting in the new park.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Hither in other days a slave would pay to have carried on a cheap bier the carcasses of his fellows, cast out from their narrow cells. Here was the common burial-place fixed for pauper folk, for Pantolabus the parasite, and spendthrift Nomentanus.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Here a pillar assigned a thousand feet frontage and three hundred of depth, and provided that the graveyard should pass to no heirs.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] To-day one may live on a wholesome Esquiline, and stroll on the sunny Rampart[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] where of late one sadly looked out on ground ghastly with bleaching bones.

	’tis not so much the thieves and beasts wont to infest the place that cause me care and trouble, as the witches who with spells and drugs vex human souls: these in no wise can I bring to naught or stop from gathering bones and harmful herbs, as soon as the roving Moon has uplifted her beauteous face.

	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c]My own eyes have seen Canidia walk with black robe tucked up, her feet bare, her hair dishevelled, shrieking with the elder Sagana. Their sallow hue had made the two hideous to behold. Then they began to dig up the earth with their nails, and to tear a black lamb to pieces with their teeth; the blood was all poured into a trench, that there-from they might draw the sprites, souls that would give them answers.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] One image there was of wool, and one of wax, the woollen one the larger, to curb and punish the smaller; the waxen stood in suppliant guise, as if awaiting death in slavish fashion. One witch calls on Hecate, the other on fell Tisiphone. You might see serpents and hell-hounds roaming about, and the blushing Moon, that she might not witness such deeds, biding behind the tall tombs. Nay, if I lie in aught, may my head be defiled by ravens’ white ordure, and may Julius and the weakling Pediatia and the thief Voranus come to water and befoul me! Why tell each detail—how in converse with Sagana the shades made echoes sad and shrill, how the two stealthily buried in the ground a wolf’s beard and the tooth of a spotted snake,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] how the fire blazed higher from the image of wax, and how as witness I shuddered at the words and deeds

	[b]An Unwelcome Companion[/b]
	While taking a morning stroll, Horace is joined by a mere acquaintance, who insists on accompanying him, hoping through closer intimacy to secure an introduction to Maecenas. The poet vainly endeavours to shake him off, and it is only when the man’s adversary in a lawsuit appears on the scene— a genuine [c dimgray]deus ex machina[/c]—that Horace is rescued from his unhappy position.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The delightful humour, the skilful dramatic treatment of the theme, and the poet’s well-established position in Maecenas’s circle which is assumed, indicate that this is one of the latest Satires, in point of composition, in the first book. It may be compared with the sixth Satire, in which Horace gives an account of his introduction to Maecenas.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires I[/b][/c]
	[b]X[/b]
	[b]On Satire[/b]
	Horace resumes a discussion of the main subject of his fourth Satire, which had brought down considerable censure upon him from the critics, who upheld the excellence of early Latin poetry, and to these he now makes reply.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He reminds them that, while he had found fault with Lucilius’s verse, he had also credited it with great satiric power. In this he was quite consistent, for one may admire good mimes without holding them to be good poems. You may make people laugh, but you must also have a terse style and a proper mixture of the grave and the gay, such as is seen in the robust writers of Old Attic Comedy, whom Hermogenes and his school never read. But Lucilius is admired for his skill in blending Greek and Latin. “Nonsense!” cries Horace, “such a mixture is a serious blemish, and no more acceptable in poetry than in oratory” (1-30).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet here confesses that at one time he had thought of writing in Greek instead of Latin, but realized in time that this would be like carrying faggots to the forest (31-35).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So while Bibaculus essays something grand and lofty, Horace is less ambitious and turns to a more modest field. If we survey contemporary literature, comedy is pre-empted by Fundanius; Pollio has won
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 112[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires I[/b][/c]
	fame in tragedy and Varius in the epic; Virgil is simple and charming in his pastorals. Satire alone was open to Horace, for Varro Atacinus and others had tried it and failed, while Horace has met with success, however short he may come of the first in the field (36-49).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is true that Horace had criticized Lucilius, just as Lucilius had pointed out defects in Accius and Ennius. His verse [c dimgray]is[/c] faulty—his stream is muddy, he lacks finish, he wrote too freely. If we were to compare him with a writer who is carving out a new species of verse quite untouched by the Greeks, we might attribute to him some polish, but the fact remains that had he lived in the Augustan age, he would have filed away his roughnesses, and learned “the last and greatest art, the art to blot” (50-71).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A writer should aim at pleasing, not the multitude, but a small circle of good critics. If he wins their approval, he may bid the cheap teachers of the lecture-room go hang! (72-91).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	With this statement of his conviction, Horace puts the finishing touch to his First Book (92).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In this satire Horace is a spokesman for the chief writers of the Augustan era, setting forth some of their ideals in contrast with the ignorance and vulgarity of popular scribblers, as represented by men like Tigellius. Among the requisites of good satire Horace speaks of the appropriate use of humour, together with the qualities of brevity, clearness, purity of diction and smoothness of composition, all of which are characteristic of the so-called plain style, or [c dimgray]genus tenue[/c], of poetry as of oratory. (For a full discussion see papers by Hendrickson and Ullman; also Fiske, [c dimgray]Lucilius and Horace[/c], pp. 336 ff.)

	\[Lucilius, how faulty you are I will prove clearly by the witness of Cato, your own advocate, who is setting to work to remove faults from your ill-wrought verses. This task is done so much more gently by him, as he is a better man, of much finer taste than the other, who as a boy was ofttimes gently entreated by the lash and moist ropes, so that later he might give aid to the poets of old against our present daintiness, when he had become the most learned of pedagogic knights.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c]To be sure I did say[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] that the verses of Lucilius run on with halting foot. Who is a partisan of Lucilius so in-and-out of season as not to confess this? And yet on the self-same page the self-same poet is praised because he rubbed the city down with much salt.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]Yet, while granting this virtue, I would not also allow him every other; for on those terms I should also have to admire the mimes of Laberius as pretty poems.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Hence it is not enough to make your

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The first eight lines are regarded as spurious, and the only reason for reproducing them is that they are given in many mss., though not in the best. The Cato referred to is Valerius Cato, a poet and critic of the late Republic, but who the [c dimgray]grammaticorum equitum doctissimus[/c] was is not known. It is surely impossible “by reaching back over the relative clause intervening” to refer these words to Cato, as does Hendrickson, who upholds the genuineness of these verses.

	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Mimes were dramatic scenes from low life, largely farcical and grotesque in character. Laberius, a Roman knight, who was compelled by Julius Caesar to act in his own mimes, was no longer living when Horace wrote.

	hearer grin with laughter—though even in that there is some merit. You need terseness, that the thought may run on, and not become entangled in verbiage that weighs upon wearied ears. You also need a style now grave, often gay, in keeping with the rôle, now of orator or poet, at times of the wit, who holds his strength in check and husbands it with wisdom. Jesting oft cuts hard knots more forcefully and effectively than gravity. Thereby those great men who wrote Old Comedy won success; therein we should imitate them—writers whom the fop Hermogenes has never read, nor that ape,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] whose skill lies solely in droning Calvus and Catullus.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

These words are not, as commonly believed, said in depreciation of Calvus and Catullus, for there was no opposition toward them on the part of the Augustan poets. See Rand, “Catullus and the Augustans,” [c dimgray]Harv. St[/c]. xvii. p. 28, and Ullman, “Horace, Catullus, and Tigellius,” [c dimgray]C.P.[/c] x. pp. 270 ff.

In the words following, [c dimgray]-ne[/c] should not be regarded as interrogative. It is an affirmative particle, as Priscian held it to be. Nothing is known about Pitholeon, but Bentley plausibly supposed he was the same as Pitholaus, who assailed Julius Caesar in verse (Suet. [c dimgray]Jul[/c]. 75).

	[c dimgray][sup]50[/sup][/c]But I did say his stream runs muddy, and often carries more that you would rather remove than leave behind. Come, pray, do you, a scholar, criticize nothing in the great Homer? Does your genial Lucilius find nothing to change in the tragedies of Accius? Does he not laugh at the verses of Ennius as lacking in dignity, though he speaks of himself as no greater than those he has blamed? And as we read the writings of Lucilius, what forbids us, too, to raise the question whether it was his own genius, or whether it was the harsh nature of his themes that denied him verses more finished and easier in their flow than if one were to put his thoughts into six feet[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and, content with this alone, were proud of having written two hundred lines before and two hundred after supping? Such was the gift of Tuscan Cassius,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] more headstrong than a rushing river, whose own books and cases, so ’tis told us, made his funeral pile.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]64[/sup][/c]Grant, say I, that Lucilius was genial and witty[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]: grant that he was also more polished than you would expect one to be who was creating a new style quite untouched by the Greeks,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and more polished than the crowd of older poets: yet, had he fallen by fate upon this our day, he would smooth away much of his work, would prune off all that trailed beyond the proper limit, and as he wrought his verse he would oft scratch his head and gnaw his nails to the quick.

	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]In this paragraph Horace contrasts writers of low literary standards, represented by Tigellius, with members of the three circles of Maecenas, Pollio and Messalla. He himself, like Virgil, belongs to the circle of Maecenas. Tibullus, a member of Messalla’s circle, is perhaps at this time too young to be named. (See Ullman, [c dimgray]C.P[/c]. x.

	[b]Satires[/b]
	[b]Book II[/b]
	[b] I[/b]
	[b]Horace’S Parting Shot At His Critics[/b]
	This Satire continues the subject of the fourth and tenth Satires of the First Book. That book had aroused much criticism, which the poet meets in this prologue to his Second Book.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Satire assumes the form of an imaginary dialogue between Horace and C. Trebatius Testa, a famous lawyer of Cicero’s time, whose legal advice on the subject of satiric writing Horace is professedly anxious to secure. Trebatius advises him to give up writing altogether, or if that is impossible, to take up epic poetry (1-12).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“I have no gift for the epic,” says Horace, “and yet I must write, and must write satire, even as Lucilius used to do. I belong to a frontier stock but am armed for defence, not offence, using the pen when attacked as naturally as the bull its horns” (13-60).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]trebatius.[/b][/c]
	Then you will come to grief. Some of your great friends will freeze you to death.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]horace.[/b][/c]
	Did those of Lucilius desert him, when he attacked great and small? Nay, he lived on intimate terms with Scipio and Laelius, and though
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 124[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires II[/b][/c]
	I fall short of him in social rank and ability, yet I, too, have illustrious friends (60-79).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]tre.[/b][/c]
	But let me remind you of the law. You are forbidden to write bad—that is, libellous— verses against anyone.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]hor.[/b][/c]
	Of course not. But what if they are good, like mine, and win Caesar’s approval?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]tre.[/b][/c]
	Then such a charge will be laughed out of court (79-86).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In view of [c dimgray]Caesaris invicti[/c] of 1.11, it would seem that this Satire was written after the Battle of Actium, and therefore shortly before the publication of this Second Book in 30 b.c. Horace is now thirty-five years of age and has won recognition and an assured position in Roman literature. He no longer finds it necessary to defend his satire very seriously, but, as Lejay, in his introduction to this Satire, has clearly shown, “the legal conditions under which satire could be produced in the Augustan age formed a very real restriction upon the freedom of speech traditional in satire. . . . There is a touch of serious anxiety beneath the jest upon the [c dimgray]mala[/c] and [c dimgray]bona carmina[/c] with which the Satire closes” (Fiske, [c dimgray]Lucilius and Horace[/c], p. 370).

	There are some critics who think that I am too savage in my satire and strain the work beyond lawful bounds. The other half of them hold that all I have composed is “nerveless,” and that verses as good as mine could be turned out a thousand a day. Give me advice, Trebatius. What am I to do?

My own delight is to shut up words in feet, as did Lucilius, a better man than either of us. He in olden days would trust his secrets to his books, as if to faithful friends, never turning elsewhere for recourse, whether things went well with him or ill. So it comes that the old poet’s whole life is open to view, as if painted on a votive tablet.

Yet he laid hold upon the leaders of the people, and upon the people in their tribes, kindly in fact only to Virtue and her friends. Nay, when virtuous Scipio and the wise and gentle Laelius withdrew into privacy from the throng and theatre of life, they would turn to folly, and flinging off restraint would indulge with him in sport while their dish of herbs was on the boil. Such as I am, however far beneath Lucilius in rank and native gifts, yet Envy, in spite of herself, will ever admit that I have lived with the great, and, while trying to strike her tooth on something soft, will dash upon what is solid. But maybe you, learned Trebatius, disagree.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires II[/b][/c]
	[b]II[/b]
	[b]A Discourse On Plain Living[/b]
	Horace puts the discourse in the mouth of Ofellus, an old neighbour of the poet’s, and a representative of the simplicity and other sturdy qualities of the Apulian farmers. As a whole, however, the Satire is mainly a collection of commonplaces taken from the teachings of the various philosophic schools, though the theme and even the mode of handling it were probably suggested by Lucilius. It stands midway between dialogue and monologue, and perhaps indicates that the author is still experimenting in regard to the form. It is probably the first one of this book in the order of composition.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The argument is as follows: Learn from me, or rather from my authority, Ofellus—a plain but shrewd countryman—the value of simple living. Let us learn the lesson before we break our fast.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A man never despises frugal fare after heavy exercise, because the pleasure of eating lies, not in costly food, but in oneself. The most tempting dainties lose their flavour for the man who has no appetite. People foolishly prefer a peacock to a pullet, simply because it has a fine tail and costs more money. So, too, a three-pound mullet is admired, while a big pike is scorned. The former
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 134[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires II[/b][/c]
	is an unnatural rarity, the latter is common, and the well-fed stomach scorns things common. Some day we shall find roast gulls in fashion (1-52).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Plain living is not the same as mean living, and you must not avoid one fault merely to fall into another. There is a happy mean between stinginess and extravagance (53-69).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A simple fare means health of body, a good digestion, sound and refreshing sleep, mental vigour. It allows one to indulge himself occasionally, as when the holidays come, or in times of ill-health, or when old age arrives. In the good old days dainties were reserved for hospitality (70-93).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A luxurious life leads to disgrace and ruin. “That may be true of others,” says one, “but I can well afford to be extravagant.” Then why not use your money for better ends? And what about the changes and chances of life? Which of the two will meet them best, the man accustomed to every comfort, or the one who is content with little (94-111)?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I knew Ofellus in my boyhood, when he was the well-to-do owner of the land on which he now pays rent. In those days he lived the same simple life that he does now, and when misfortunes came, he faced them bravely and in true philosophic fashion (113-136).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Kiessling has pointed out how closely this Satire reproduces some ideas found in the well-known letter of Epicurus to Menoecus (Diog. Laert. x. 131), but Lejay has also called attention to striking parallels in Cicero’s philosophical writings. Even the phrase [c dimgray]tenuis victus[/c] (1.53) is Ciceronian ([c dimgray]cf[/c]. [c dimgray]Tusc[/c]. [c dimgray]Disp[/c]. iii. 49.5; v. 26.89, etc.). “Cicéron,” says Lejay (p. 380), “est peut-être encore plus complètement l’inspiration des grandes lignes de la satire.”

	Satire II
	What and how great, my friends, is the virtue of frugal living—now this is no talk of mine, but is the teaching of Ofellus, a peasant, a philosopher unschooled and of rough mother-wit—learn, I say, not amid the tables’ shining dishes, when the eye is dazed by senseless splendour, and the mind, turning to vanities, rejects the better part; but here, before we dine, let us discuss the point together. “Why so?” I will tell you, if I can.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c]Every judge who has been bribed weighs truth badly. After hunting the hare or wearily dismounting from an unbroken horse, or else, if Roman army-exercises[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] are fatiguing to one used to Greek ways, it may be the swift ball takes your fancy, where the excitement pleasantly beguiles the hard toil, or it may be the discus (by all means hurl the discus through the yielding air)—well, when toil has knocked the daintiness out of you; when you are thirsty and hungry, despise, if you can, plain food; refuse to drink any mead, unless the honey is from Hymettus, and the wine from Falernum.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] The butler is out; the sea, dark and stormy, protects its fish; bread and salt will suffice to appease your growling belly. Whence or how do you think this comes about? The chiefest pleasure lies, not in the costly savour, but in

Do you eat the feathers you so admire? Does the bird look as fine when cooked? Yet, though in their meat they are on a par, to think that you crave the one rather than the other, duped by the difference in appearance! Very well. But what sense tells you whether this pike gasping here was caught in the Tiber or in the sea, whether in the eddies between the bridges[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] or just at the mouth of the Tuscan[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] river? You foolish fellow, you praise a three-pound mullet, which you must needs cut up into single portions.’Tis the look, I see, that takes you. Why then detest a very long pike? It is, of course, because nature has made the pike large, and the mullet light of weight. Only a stomach that seldom feels hunger scorns things common.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]70[/sup][/c]Now learn what and how great are the blessings that simple living brings in its train. First of all, good health. For how harmful to a man a variety of dishes is, you may realize, if you recall that plain fare which agreed with you in other days. But as soon as you mix boiled and roast, shell-fish and thrushes, the sweet will turn to bile, and the thick phlegm will cause intestine feud. Do you see how pale rises each guest from his “puzzle feast”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]?

Yet at times he will be able to pass over to better cheer, whether the revolving year brings some holiday, or he wants to renew a shrunken frame, and when, as time advances, the frailty of age looks for more indulgent treatment. But as for you, if ill-health come, or enfeebling age, what will you bring to add to that indulgence which, while young and hale, you thus forestall?

Why is any worthy man in want, while you are rich? Why are the ancient temples of the gods in ruin? Why, shameless man, do you not measure out something from that great heap for your dear country? You alone, of course, will always find things go well. Oh, what a laughing-stock you will be some day for your enemies!

	sturdy tenant-farmer, and this is his story: “I was not the man to eat on a working day, without good reason, anything more than greens and the shank of a smoked ham, and if after long absence a friend came to see me, or if in rainy weather, when I could not work, a neighbour paid me a visit—a welcome guest—we fared well, not with fish sent for from town, but with a pullet or a kid; by and by raisins and nuts and split figs set off our dessert. Then we had a game of drinking, with a forfeit to rule the feast,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and Ceres, to whom we made our prayer—“so might she rise on lofty stalk!”—smoothed out with wine the worries of a wrinkled brow. Let Fortune storm and stir fresh turmoils; how much will she take off from this? How much less sleek have I been, or you, my lads, since this new landlord came? Nature, in truth, makes neither him nor me nor anyone else lord of the soil as his own. He drove us out, and he will be driven out by villainy, or by ignorance of the quirks of the law, or in the last resort by an heir of longer life. To-day the land bears the name of Umbrenus; of late it had that of Ofellus; to no one will it belong for good, but for use it will pass, now to me and now to another.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Live, then, as brave men, and with brave hearts confront the strokes of fate.”

	[b]The Follies Of Mankind[/b]
	According to the Stoics, everyone save the wise man is mad; πᾶς ἄϕρων μαίνεται. Horace makes this paradox his text and assails the follies of the world.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Satire takes the form of a dialogue between the poet and Damasippus. Horace is at his newly acquired Sabine farm, to which he has retired to avoid the excitement of the Saturnalia in Rome. Damasippus, of whom we hear in Cicero’s Epistles, is a bankrupt speculator and dealer in works of art, who, having fallen into the depths of despair, had been rescued by the Stoic sage Stertinius, was converted by him to philosophy, and so made into the wise man he has now become. He reports a long discourse of Stertinius upon the text, “all men, save only the wise, are mad” (1-81).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The sermon of Stertinius may be divided into four parts, dealing with avarice (82-157), ambition (158-223), self-indulgence (225-280), and superstition (281-295), all of which are phases of madness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The avaricious are the largest class of madmen. They believe poverty to be the greatest possible disgrace, and suppose that wealth can confer every blessing (91-97). Avarice, as well as its opposite,

	prodigality, are illustrated by the story of the two sons of Servius Oppidius (168-178).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The ambitious are mad. Agamemnon, slaying his daughter for the sake of power and position, was just as mad as Ajax, who slew sheep under the delusion that they were his enemies (193-213).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The madness of self-indulgence is illustrated by the spendthrift Nomentanus, who wastes the fortune he has inherited (224-238); by the son of Aesopus, who swallows the precious pearl of his mistress which he has dissolved in vinegar (239-241); by the sons of Arrius, who breakfast on costly nightingales (243-246); and especially by the follies of lovers, who are often as crazy as would be a grown-up man if he indulged in the sports of children (247-254). Better for them to follow the example of Polemon, who listened to the voice of reason and cast away the tokens of his malady (254-257). The love passion may even lead to bloodshed, as we saw the other day when Marius murdered his mistress and took his own life (275-280).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The madness of superstition is illustrated by the old freedman who prayed for immortality, and by the mother whose sick son recovers only to be killed through her foolish vow (281-295).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“And what,” asks Horace, as Damasippus brings this long sermon of Stertinius to a close, “is my madness? I think I am sane.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]damasippus.[/b][/c]
	So Agave thought, when she was carrying in her hands the head of her unfortunate son.

	[c darkmagenta][b]hor.[/b][/c]
	You greater madman, spare the lesser! (296-326).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This is not only the longest, but also the best constructed of Horace’s Satires. Notwithstanding the long discourse which makes up the main body of the poem, the dialogue-form serves as a framework for the whole, and allows the poet to employ a light, humorous vein in both beginning and end, where he turns the laugh against himself. Note that while the writer’s main aim throughout is to portray striking forms of human folly, a second one is to ridicule the airs and manners of the Stoic preachers of the day. The Satire was probably written in 33 b.c., because in 1.185 there is a reference to the curule aedileship of Agrippa, held in that year and distinguished by magnificence of display.

In vain you blame the pen; and the innocent wall, begotten when gods and poets were angry, must suffer.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Yet you had the look of one who threatened great and glorious things, if once you were care-free and your country cottage welcomed you under its warm roof. What was the use of packing Plato[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] with Menander, and of taking out of town Eupolis and Archilochus, such weighty comrades? Think you to lay Envy low by deserting Virtue?

	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]Though Orelli supposed that Plato the philosopher is here meant, it seems certain that Horace is speaking of Plato the poet, leader of the so-called Middle Attic Comedy. Thus he would take with him to the country representatives of Old (Eupolis), Middle, and New (Menander) Comedy, as well as the great iambic poet, Archilochus.

	Ever since the wreck of all my fortunes at the Central Arcade,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] I have looked after other people’s business, after being flung overboard from my own. There was a time when my hobby[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] was to look out for the bronze in which shrewd old Sisyphus had washed his feet, and to see what work of art was crude in the carving, what was too rough in the casting. As an expert, I valued this or that statue at a hundred thousand. As to gardens and fine houses, I was the one man that knew how to buy them at a bargain; hence the crowded streets gave me the nickname of “Mercury’s pet.”[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	My good sir, don’t deceive yourself; you, too, are mad, and so, I may say, are all fools, if there is any truth in the preaching of Stertinius, from whom I took down these wondrous lessons that I learned, the very day that he consoled me, and bade me grow a wise man’s beard, and go home from the Fabrician bridge,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] no longer sad.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]64[/sup][/c]“Damasippus is mad in buying old statues; the creditor of Damasippus, is he sound of mind? Be it so! But if I say to you, ‘Take this sum which you need never return to me,’ will you be a madman if you take it? Or will you be more senseless if you spurn the booty which propitious Mercury offers? ‘Write out ten bonds drawn up by Nerius.’[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] That’s not enough; add a hundred of the cunning Cicuta—add a thousand fetters! yet your scoundrelly Proteus will slip out from all these ties. When you drag him to court, he will laugh at your expense;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] he will turn into a boar, then into a bird, then into a stone, or, if he likes, a tree. If it be the mark of a madman to manage an estate badly, but of a sane man to manage well, then much more addled, believe me, is the brain of a Perellius, who dictates the bond, which you can never pay.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Fufius played the part of the sleeping heroine in the [c dimgray]Ilione[/c] of Pacuvius, but when the ghost of her murdered son (a part taken by Catienus) called upon her, he was so sound asleep that he did not hear, though the audience, taking up the actor’s words, joined in the appeal.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]These words are addressed to the creditor, who is shown to be more foolish than the borrower, for whatever notes or bonds are involved in the transaction, they prove to be worthless in the end. With [c dimgray]decem[/c] understand [c dimgray]tabulas[/c], Nerius being, like Cicuta and Perellius, a money-lender. They are all supposed to be uncommonly shrewd. Many prefer to supply [c dimgray]sestertia[/c] with [c dimgray]decem[/c], taking Nerius to be a banker who pays out money on an order from the creditor.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Horace’s phrase [c dimgray]malis ridentem alienis[/c], “laugh with alien jaws,” is an echo of Homer’s γναθμοῖσι γελοίων ἀλλοτρίοισιν ([c dimgray]Od[/c]. xx. 347), which, however, referred to forced, unnatural laughter.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]Stertinius now assumes that he is addressing a class, and therefore bids his hearers prepare for a formal discourse, such as Stoic teachers frequently delivered.

The heirs of Staberius had to engrave upon his tomb the sum of his estate: should they fail to do so, they were bound to provide for the people a hundred pairs of gladiators,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] with such a feast as Arrius would direct, and as much corn as Africa reaps. ‘Whether I am right or wrong in willing this,’ he wrote, ‘don’t play the uncle[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] with me.’ That, I take it, is what Staberius in his wisdom foresaw. ‘Well,’ you ask, ‘what was his intent when he willed that his heirs should carve on stone the sum of his estate?’ All his life long he thought poverty a monstrous evil, and shunned nothing more earnestly, so that, if haply he had died less rich by a single penny, so far would he have thought himself the worse man. For all things—worth, repute, honour, things divine and human—are slaves to the beauty of wealth, and he who has made his ‘pile’ will be famous, brave and just. ‘And wise too?’ Yes, wise, and a king and anything else he pleases.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] His riches, as though won by worth, would bring him, he hoped, great renown.

You’re not doing this at Argos, nor killing a mother with a sword, as mad Orestes did.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Or do you suppose he went mad after killing his parent, and was not spurred to frenzy by the wicked Furies before he warmed his sharp steel in his mother’s throat? Nay, from the moment that Orestes was held to be of unsafe mind, he did nothing whatever that you can condemn. He did not dare to attack with the sword Pylades or his sister Electra. He merely threw ill words at both, calling her a Fury, and him by some other name which his gleaming choler prompted.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

But his physician, a man of very quick wit and a loyal friend, revives him by this device. He has a table brought in and bags of coin poured out, and bids many draw near to count it. Thus he brings the man to, and adds, ‘Unless you guard your wealth, your greedy heir will be off with it forthwith.’ ‘What, while I’m alive?’ ‘Well, if you mean to live, wake up.

Ajax, when he slays harmless lambs, is insane. When [c dimgray]you[/c] purposely commit a crime for empty glory, are you sound of mind, and is your heart, when swollen with pride, free from fault? Suppose one chose to carry about in a litter a pretty lamb, and, treating it as a daughter, provided it with clothes, maids, gold, called it ‘Goldie’ or ‘Teenie,’ and planned to have it wed a gallant husband: the praetor by injunction would take from him all control, and the care of him would pass to his sane relations. Well, if a man offers up his daughter, as if she were a dumb lamb, is he sound of mind? Say not so. Thus, where there is perverse folly, there is the height of madness.

In love inhere these evils—first war, then peace: things almost as fickle as the weather, shifting about by blind chance, and if one were to try to reduce them to fixed rule for himself, he would no more set them right than if he aimed at going mad by fixed rule and method.’ Why, when you pick the pips from Picenian apples,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and are glad if by chance you have hit the vaulted roof, are you master of yourself?

All this crowd[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] also Chrysippus will place in the prolific family of Menenius. ‘O Jupiter, who givest and takest away sore afflictions,’ cries the mother of a child that for five long months has been ill abed, ‘if the quartan chills leave my child, then on the morning of the day on which thou appointest a fast,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] he shall stand naked in the Tiber.’ Should chance or the doctor raise the sick lad up from his peril, his crazy mother will kill him by planting him on the cold bank and bringing back his fever.

	[b]The Art of Good Living[/b]
	“Where is the man that can live without dining?” In the Rome of the Augustan Age cookery seems to have held the place it had occupied in Greece in the degenerate days of the Middle and New Attic Comedy, when, as Mahaffy says,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] “it was no mere trade, but a natural gift, a special art, a school of higher philosophy.” This false importance given to the subject is gently satirized by Horace, who represents himself as meeting one Catius, just as the latter is hurrying home to arrange his notes upon a wonderful lecture on gastronomy, which he has just heard, and of which Horace induces him to repeat the main points. Horace professes profound admiration for so much learning, and begs his friend to take him to hear the lecturer himself, who must be what Epicurus was to Lucretius, the fountain-head of wisdom in regard to right living.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There has been much speculation, both as to who Catius was or represents and as to the main purport of this Satire. Among the [c dimgray]Saturae[/c] of Ennius there was one with the formidable title [c dimgray]Heduphagetica[/c], which dealt with gastronomical matters and was based on the ‘Hδυπάθεια of Archestratus of Gela. It is clear

	from his fragments that Lucilius handled the same topic, and we find among the titles of Varro’s [c dimgray]Menippean Satires[/c] that of Περὶ ἐδεσμάτων. It is probable therefore that Horace is simply trying his hand upon a traditional satiric theme.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But it is possible that the Satire has a greater significance than this. In the preceding Satire Horace deals in his own humorous fashion with the Stoics; in this he seems to be playing with the Epicureans. In the concluding verses the reference to Lucretius is unmistakable, while scattered through the Satire are philosophical terms, such as [c dimgray]natura[/c] (7, 21, 45, 64), [c dimgray]praecepta[/c] (11), [c dimgray]ratio[/c] (36), and [c dimgray]ingenium[/c] (47), which are conspicuous in Lucretius’s great poem. Palmer can see no reference to Epicureanism here, because Horace was himself an Epicurean, but Horace was never firmly wedded to any school. He was a free lance,
	[m1]\ [/m]

	nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri
	([c dimgray]Epist[/c]. i. 1.14),
	and even if he was an orthodox Epicurean, what was there to prevent his satirizing those of the school whose idea of the [c dimgray]vita beata[/c] was to have good things to eat and drink? Even Metrodorus, intimate friend of Epicurus, is reported to have said that “it is our business, not to seek crowns by saving the Greeks, but to enjoy ourselves in good eating and drinking” (Plutarch, [c dimgray]Adv. Col[/c]. 1125 d).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As to Catius, the scholiasts tell us that he was an Epicurean and (like Lucretius) the author of a [c dimgray]De rerum natura[/c], but in commenting on 1.47 they also refer to another Catius who had written a book on the baker’s art. There is a Catius, an Insubrian and an
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 184[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires II[/b][/c]
	Epicurean, spoken of by Cicero as lately dead ([c dimgray]Ad fam[/c]. xv. 16; [c dimgray]cf[/c]. Quintilian, x. 1.124), and it is highly probable that for this dramatic purpose Horace here introduces a person of an earlier generation in much the same way in which he uses Trebatius in the first, and Damasippus in the third, Satires of this book.

	If you set Massic wine beneath a cloudless sky, all its coarseness will be toned down by the night air, and the scent, unfriendly to the nerves, will pass off; but the same wine, when strained through linen, is spoiled, losing its full flavour. Surrentine wine a knowing man mixes with lees of Falernian, and carefully collects the sediment with pigeons’ eggs, for the yolk sinks to the bottom, carrying with it all foreign matter.

	Apples from Tibur yield to the Picenian in flavour, but in look are finer. The Venuculan grape suits the preserving jar; the Alban you had better dry in the smoke.

It is a monstrous sin to spend three thousand on the fish market, and then to cramp those sprawling fishes in a narrow dish.

	[b]The Art of Legacy-Hunting[/b]
	The practice of seeking legacies, especially from those who had no family connexions, seems to have been common in Rome at the beginning of the Imperial period. Horace, therefore, in true satiric fashion, undertakes to lay down rules for the guidance of those who may need advice in playing the game.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Satire takes the form of a dialogue, and is a burlesque continuation of a famous scene in the Eleventh Odyssey (90-149), where Odysseus (Ulysses), in the lower world, learns from the Theban seer Tiresias that he will return to his home in Ithaca, but only when reduced to poverty. The hero, therefore, desires to ascertain how he may again enrich himself, and the seer instructs him in the lucrative ways of fortune-hunting;
	[m1]\ [/m]
	From the obvious reference to Actium in [c dimgray]tellure marique magnus[/c] (1.63) we infer that the Satire was not composed before 30 b.c. The skilful parody of epic style shows Horace’s satiric power at its best, and it is well to recall the fact that the travestying of heroic themes is traditional in both satire and comedy. The [c dimgray]Amphitryo[/c] of Plautus, based on some play of the New Attic Comedy, is a good example. Both Lucilius and Varro made use of parody, and it is

	a prominent feature of the prose satire of Lucian, upon which many modern satires have been modelled, such as Disraeli’s [c dimgray]Ixion in Heaven[/c] and [c dimgray]The Infernal Marriage[/c], and Bangs’s [c dimgray]Houseboat on the Styx[/c]. Lucian’s resemblances to Horace, which, according to Lejay, are due to a direct knowledge of the Roman poet on the part of Lucian, may really be the result of their common indebtedness to Menippus of Gadara ([c dimgray]cf[/c]. Fiske, [c dimgray]Lucilius and Horace[/c], p. 401). Sellar describes the poem before us as “the most trenchant of all the Satires” of Horace, who doubtless conceived the utmost contempt for the fortune-hunters of his day. No analysis is necessary.

I will let anyone pluck out my eyes sooner than have him scorn you or rob you of a nutshell.

Then shall the son-in-law thus proceed: to his father-in-law he shall give the tablets of his will, and pray him to read them. After many a refusal at length Nasica shall take them, and read them to himself, and shall find that nothing is left to him and his but—to whine.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]70[/sup][/c]Here’s another hint I give you. If it so chance that some crafty dame or freedman sways an old dotard, make common cause with them. Praise them, that they may praise you behind your back. This too helps; but far better is it to storm the citadel itself. Will the idiot write poor verses? Praise them. Is he a libertine?

	Yes, for the young suitors who came were sparing of their gifts; their thoughts were not so much on loving as on eating. So it is your Penelope is virtuous; but if just once she gets from one old man a taste of gain in partnership with you, then she will be like the hound, which can never be frightened away from the greasy hide.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

Nasica probably owed money to Coranus, and gave him his daughter in marriage, hoping that the son-in-law would by will free him from his debt. This would seem to imply that the son-in-law was older than the father-in-law.

	[b]Town And Country Life[/b]
	This famous Satire, which has been so happily imitated by Pope, contrasts the annoyances and discomforts of life in Rome with the peace and happiness enjoyed by the poet on his beloved Sabine farm.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is probably owing to its peculiarly personal tone that for this Satire Horace does not set up a dialogue framework, but reverts to the monologue form of the First Book, although a large portion of the poem, viz. the fable of the Town and the Country Mouse, is put into the mouth of another speaker.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Kiessling has pointed out how the hours of morning (1-23) and of evening (60-76), as spent in the country, suggest the two side-pictures of a triptych, which enclose the central and larger picture, that of a day passed in Rome (23-59). The contrast thus presented between the peacefulness of rural life and the restlessness of city life is then summed up in the delightful allegory with which the Satire concludes (79-117). Nothing could be more artistic than such an arrangement.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Besides being one of the most charming of Horace’s compositions, this Satire is important for settling some of the chronology of Horace’s life. Thus 1.38

	seems to refer to the time which included the Battle of Actium and succeeding events, when Maecenas, in the absence of Octavian, had full control in Rome and Italy. The mention of the Dacians in 1.53 reminds us that these people wavered between Octavian and Antony and that Crassus was sent against them in 30 b.c. Again, the assignment of lands to the veterans, referred to in 1.55, is doubtless the reward promised for services at Actium. In this connexion some of the soldiers mutinied in the winter of 31 b.c. The Satire therefore was composed late in 31 b.c. or early in 30 b.c, and it follows from 11.40 ff. that Horace entered the circle of Maecenas in 39 or 38 b.c. The Sabine farm was given to the poet some six years later.

	This is what I prayed for![c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—a piece of land not so very large, where there would be a garden, and near the house a spring of ever-flowing water, and up above these a bit of woodland. More and better than this have the gods done for me. I am content. Nothing more do I ask, O son of Maia,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] save that thou make these blessings last my life long. If I have neither made my substance larger by evil ways, nor mean to make it smaller by excesses or neglect; if I offer up no such foolish prayers as these: “O if there could be added that near corner, which now spoils the shape of my little farm! O that some lucky strike would disclose to me a pot of money, like the man who, having found a treasure-trove, bought and ploughed the self-same ground he used to work on hire, enriched by favour of Hercules” !—if what I have gives me comfort and content, then thus I pray to thee: make fat the flocks I own, and all else save my wit, and, as thou art wont, still be my chief guardian!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c]So, now that from the city I have taken myself off to my castle in the hills, to what should I sooner give renown in the Satires of my prosaic Muse? Here no wretched place-hunting worries me to death, nor the leaden scirocco, nor sickly autumn, that brings gain to hateful Libitina.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]In the opening words Horace gives utterance to a feeling of deep satisfaction as he contemplates the scene before him in the morning sunshine. His former prayer has been realized. Hence the past tense of [c dimgray]erat[/c].
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Mercury was god of luck and gain; Hercules the god of treasure-trove (see 11.12, 13 below).
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The old Italian goddess Libitina, sometimes identified with Persephone, presided over funerals.

Whoever comes my way asks my opinion: “My good sir, you must know—you come so much closer to the gods: you haven’t heard any news about the Dacians, have you?” “None whatever.” “How you will always mock at us!” But heaven confound me, if I have heard a word! “Well, is it in the three-cornered isle,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] or on Italian soil, that Caesar means to give the soldiers their promised lands?” When I swear I know nothing, they marvel at me as, forsooth, the man of all men remarkably and profoundly reticent.

Roughly he fared, frugal of his store, yet could open his thrifty soul in acts of hospitality. In short, he grudged not his hoard of vetch or long oats, but bringing in his mouth a dried raisin and nibbled bits of bacon he served them, being eager by varying the fare to overcome the daintiness of a guest, who, with squeamish tooth, would barely touch each morsel. Meanwhile, outstretched on fresh straw, the master of the house himself ate spelt and darnel, leaving the titbits to his friend.

Inasmuch as all creatures that live on earth have mortal souls, and for neither great nor small is there escape from death, therefore, good sir, while you may, live happy amid joys; live mindful ever of how brief your time is! “These words struck home with the rustic, who lightly leaped forth from his house. Then both pursue the journey as planned, eager to creep under the city walls by night.

	[c dimgray][sup]100[/sup][/c] And now night was holding the mid space of heaven, when the two set foot in a wealthy palace, where covers dyed in scarlet glittered on ivory couches, and many courses remained over from a great dinner of the evening before, in baskets piled up hard by. So when the town mouse has the rustic stretched out on purple covers, he himself bustles about in waiter-style, serving course after course, and doing all the duties of the home-bred slave, first tasting everything he serves. The other, lying at ease, enjoys his changed lot, and amid the good cheer is playing the happy guest, when of a sudden a terrible banging of the doors tumbled them both from their couches. In panic they run the length of the hall, and still more terror-stricken were they, as the lofty palace rang with the barking of Molossian hounds. Then says the rustic: “No use have I for such a life, and so farewell: my wood and hole, secure from alarms, will solace me with homely vetch.”

	[b]Only The Wise Are Free[/b]
	The scene is laid in Rome during the Saturnalia, when slaves were treated with great indulgence (1.4 and [c dimgray]Sat.[/c] ii. 3.5). Davus, the slave of Horace, is therefore permitted to speak his mind freely to his master (1-5).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He remarks that some men are consistent in their vices, others waver between vice and virtue. Horace is an inconsistent man. He praises the good old times, but would not go back to them if he could. In town he pines for the country, in the country he longs for the town. If not invited out, he pretends to be glad, but if an invitation from Maecenas comes at a late hour, off he runs in great excitement, leaving his expectant parasites in the lurch, and proving that he is no better than they (6-42).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“What,” asks Davus, “if you, the master, be found to be a greater fool than I, your slave?” Such an audacious remark provokes Horace’s wrath, but Davus is allowed to report the lessons of wisdom, which a servant of Crispinus had overheard at the door of his master’s lecture-room, and had passed on to him (42-45).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The so-called master, victim of his passions, pursues intrigues, stoops to mean devices to gain his

	ends, runs all sorts of risks, and sacrifices character and everything else that he has. He is a real slave, whom no manumission can free, and his Davus is but his fellow-slave. He is a mere puppet, worked by wires that others pull (46-82).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Who, then, is free? Only the wise man, who is complete master of himself. He who is subject to passion is never that (83-94).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Again, the so-called master is not above his slave in other faults. The latter wastes time gazing on crude posters, the former is crazy over some great artist’s paintings. The slave likes pasties and gets a thrashing, the master loves grand suppers and suffers from indigestion. The slave swaps the brush he has stolen for a bunch of grapes, the master sells off his estates to fill his belly. Why, this master cannot bear his own company. He is a runaway and vagabond, ever seeking, though in vain, to baffle care (95-115).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This is too much for the angered master, who threatens to send his slave out to his Sabine farm (116-118).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This Satire is a close companion of the third, and deals with another Stoic paradox, viz. that only the philosopher is free, ὅτι μόνος ὁ σοϕὸς ἐλεύθερος. Both Satires have the Saturnalia—a time of free speech—as their setting, and are much alike in substance, both dealing with the follies of mankind, and handling the theme in a very similar dramatic fashion. Here the Stoic teacher Crispinus corresponds to Stertinius. The slave Davus, who finds that, being wise, he is free, takes the place of the social outcast Damasippus, who discovered that he was no more mad than other men. In both Satires Horace is the auditor of the
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 222[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires II[/b][/c]
	sermon, the lessons of which he must apply to himself. In both he feigns an outburst of anger.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Though Horace thus allows his own name to be used, the dialogue is really between [c dimgray]any[/c] slave and [c dimgray]any[/c] master. It is true that, to heighten the humour of the scene, he introduces, at the beginning and perhaps at the end of the criticism of the master (so 11. 22-35; 111-115), some of the atmosphere of reality, but so far as the main features of the master’s portrait are concerned, it would be more correct to regard the slave Davus, the preacher of wisdom, as the Horace of real life. That the poet is not describing himself with any consistency is clear from 11.102, ff., where he is accused of gluttony, whereas we know that he was very abstemious ([c dimgray]cf. Sat.[/c] i. 5.7-9). The seeming self-accusation as to serious offences, therefore, we may put down to dramatic necessity or to comic exaggeration.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The dialogue form is maintained throughout, though during the delivery of Crispinus’s lecture it is held in suspense.

	Some men persist in their love of vice and stick to their purpose; the greater number waver, now aiming at the right, at times giving way to evil.

	smell. I am weak, lazy, and, if you like to add, a toper. But you, since you are just the same and maybe worse, would you presume to assail me, as though you were a better man, and would you throw over your own vices a cloak of seemly words?” What if you are found to be a greater fool than even I, who cost you five hundred drachmas?[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Don’t try to scare me by your looks. Hold back your hand and temper, while I set forth the lessons taught me by the porter of Crispinus.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]46[/sup][/c]You are the slave of another man’s wife; Davus of a poor harlot. Which of us commits a sin more deserving of the cross? When vehement nature drives me, she who satisfies my passion sends me away neither disgraced nor anxious lest some richer or more handsome man possess her. You, when you have cast aside your badges, the ring of knighthood and your Roman dress, and step forth, no longer a judge,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] but a low Dama, with a cape hiding your perfumed head, are you not what you pretend to be? Full of fear, you are let into the house, and you tremble with a terror that clashes with your passions. What matters it, whether you go off in bondage,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] to be scourged and slain with the sword, or whether, shut up in a shameful chest, where the maid, conscious of her mistress’s sin, has stowed you away, you touch your crouching head with your knees? Has not the husband of the erring matron a just power over both? Over the seducer a still juster? Yet she
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Roughly equivalent to £20, or $100, a low price for a slave.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Davus is a σπερμολόγος, “a picker up of learning’s crumbs,” and he has picked them up, not from the Stoic Crispinus himself, but at second-hand from his door-keeper, who would be in a position to catch some scraps of the lectures delivered in the school-room.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The term [c dimgray]iudex[/c] implies a citizen of good standing. See note on [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. i. 4.123. That Horace could claim equestrian rank, and was even a “potential senator,” is maintained by Lily Ross Taylor in an article on “Horace’s Equestrian Career” in [c dimgray]A.J.P[/c]. xlvi. (1925) pp. 161 ff. So, too, Haight, [c dimgray]Horace[/c], etc. p. 38.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]The word [c dimgray]auctoratus[/c] is technical, being applicable to one who sold himself as a gladiator.

No, you will seek occasion so as again to be in terror, again to face ruin, O you slave many times over! But what beast, having once burst its bonds and escaped, perversely returns to them again? “I am no adulterer,” you say. And, in faith, I am no thief either, when I wisely pass by your silver plate. Take away the risk, set aside restraint, and Nature will spring forward, to roam at will.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Are you my master, you, a slave to the dominion of so many men and things—you, whom the praetor’s rod, though placed on your head three or four times over,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] never frees from base terror? And over and above what I have said, add something of no less weight: whether one who obeys a slave is an underslave,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] as the custom of your class names him, or a fellow-slave, what am I in respect of you? Why, you, who lord it over me, are the wretched slave of another master, and you are moved like a wooden puppet by wires that others pull.

A woman asks of you five talents, worries you, shuts her door in your face, drenches you in cold water, then—calls you back. Rescue your neck from the yoke of shame; come, say, “I am free, am free.” You cannot; for you have a master, and no gentle one, plaguing your soul, pricking your weary side with the sharp spur, and driving you on against your will.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires II[/b][/c]
	[b]VIII[/b]
	[b]A Fiasco of a Dinner-Party[/b]
	The poet describes a dinner at which Maecenas was the guest of honour. Three men of letters were also in the company—Fundanius, Viscus, and Varius. The rest of the guests are undistinguished, and are probably imaginary characters who could not be identified. Porcius, for instance, true to his name, eats like a pig. Balatro is a buffoon, and Nomentanus is one of the traditional characters of satire. Moreover, the host, Nasidienus Rufus, is otherwise quite unknown.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	These facts warrant us in acquitting Fundanius (and therefore the author who introduced him) on the charge of extremely bad taste in heaping ridicule on a host whose hospitality had been accepted. Horace, in fact, adopts a principle, which is illustrated in the previous Satire, of securing a certain amount of verisimilitude through the use of known facts, and of drawing on his imagination for the rest of his material. The Satire is directed, partly against the ostentation and vulgarity sometimes displayed by wealth, and partly against the curious and affected erudition of pronounced epicures. In this latter respect it resembles the fourth Satire of this book.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 236[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Satires II[/b][/c]
	The party was arranged according to the following plan:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	"1. Fundanius; 2. Viscus; 3. Varius; 4. Balatro; 5. Vibidius; 6. Maecenas; 7. Nomentanus; 8. Nasidienus; 9. Porcius." [s]LCL194-p237-f1.png[/s]
	Fiske has shown that Lucilius was “the first to establish the traditions of the δεῖπνον in Latin Satire,” and that in this Eighth Satire Horace keeps in fairly close touch with the twentieth book of Lucilius, where a banquet given by the [c dimgray]praeco[/c] Granius was reported to the satirist by L. Licinius Crassus ([c dimgray]Lucilius and Horace[/c], pp. 408 ff.). But, as Lucilius wrote at least five satires on banquets, it is not surprising to find that Lejay (p. 580) regards his fifth book as the chief model followed here by Horace.

	Tell me, if you don’t mind, what was the first dish to appease an angry appetite?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]fun.[/b][/c]
	First there was a wild boar.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] It was caught when a gentle south wind was blowing, as the father of the feast kept telling us. Around it were pungent turnips, lettuces, radishes—such things as whet a jaded appetite—skirret, fish-pickle, and Coan lees. When these were removed, a high-girt slave with purple napkin wiped well the maple-wood table, while a second swept up the scraps and anything that could offend the guests. Then, like an Attic maid[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] bearing Ceres’ sacred emblems, there came forward dusky Hydaspes with Caecuban wine, and Alcon with Chian, unmixed with brine.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Then said our host: “If Alban is more to your taste, Maecenas, or Falernian, we have both.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]A dinner-party usually began at the ninth hour (about 3 p.m.), but an ultra-extravagant one might begin even earlier.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The boar with relishes here formed the [c dimgray]gustatio[/c], and is another sign of extravagant luxury; [c dimgray]cf[/c]. Pliny viii. 210, “in principio (cenae) bini ternique mandantur apri.” More commonly it would appear as the [c dimgray]pièce de résistance[/c]. See note on [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. ii. 4.11.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c][c dimgray]i[/c].[c dimgray]e[/c]. like a κανηϕόρος in the rites of Demeter; [c dimgray]cf[/c]. [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. i. 3.9.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]The Caecuban was one of the finest Italian, as Chian was one of the best Greek, wines. The host’s Chian being very good, he did not do what was often done—add sea-water to give it a tang. Columella (xii. 21.37) gives directions as to the proportions to be used. The phrase [c dimgray]maris expers[/c] corresponds to τεθαλαττωμένον in Athenaeus i. p. 32.

	Myself at the top, then next to me Viscus of Thurii, and below, if I remember, Varius. Then Vibidius and Servilius Balatro, the “shades”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] that Maecenas had brought with him. Above our host was Nomentanus; below him, Porcius, who made us laugh by swallowing whole cheese-cakes at a mouthful. Nomentanus was there to see that if anything perchance escaped our notice, he might point it out with his forefinger; for the rest of the folk[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—we, I mean—eat fowl, oysters, and fish, which had a flavour far different from any we knew, as, for instance, was made clear at once, after he had handed me the livers of a plaice and a turbot, a dish I had never tasted before. After this he informed me that the honey-apples were red because picked in the light of a waning moon. What difference that makes you would learn better from himself.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c]Then said Vibidius to Balatro: “Unless we drink him bankrupt, we shall die unavenged,” and he calls for larger cups. Then did paleness overspread the face of the host, who dreaded nothing so much as hard drinkers, either because they chaff one too freely or because fiery wines dull the delicate palate. Vibidius and Balatro tilt whole decanters of wine into Allifan goblets.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] All followed suit, save the guests on the lowest couch, who did no harm to the flagons.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The [c dimgray]cetera turba[/c] are the uninitiated guests as contrasted with the knowing Nomentanus. The subject of [c dimgray]porrexerat[/c] is not the host, as commonly supposed, but Nomentanus, who is doing the work assigned him.

Upon this the master: “This,” said he, “was caught before spawning; if taken later, its flesh would have been poorer. The ingredients of the sauce are these: oil from Venafrum of the first pressing, roe from the juices of the Spanish mackerel, wine five years old, but produced this side of the sea,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] poured in while it is on the boil—after boiling, Chian suits better than anything else—white pepper, and vinegar made from the fermenting of Lesbian vintage. I was the first to point out that one should boil in the sauce green rockets and bitter elecampane; Curtillus would use sea-urchins, unwashed, inasmuch as the yield of the sea-shellfish itself is better than a briny pickle.”

What would have been the end, had not Nomentanus, the philosopher, thus rallied his friend: “Ah, Fortune, what god is more cruel toward us than thou! How thou dost ever delight to make sport of the life of man!” Varius could scarce smother a laugh with his napkin. Balatro, who sneers at everything, said: “These are the terms of life, and therefore the meed of fame will never equal your labour.

Then follow servants, bearing on a huge charger the limbs of a crane sprinkled with much salt and meal, and the liver of a white goose fattened on rich figs, and hares’ limbs torn off, as being more dainty than if eaten with the loins.

	[b]Epistles[/b]
	[b]To Maecenas[/b]
	The First Epistle, which serves as an introduction to the First Book, and is addressed to the poet’s patron, Maecenas, professes to explain why Horace has given up the writing of lyric poetry. He is now too old for such folly, and his mind has turned to another field.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“Why,” he asks, “should you wish the gladiator, who has earned his discharge, to return to his former training-school? A warning voice within bids me loose the old steed before he stumble at the end of his course. And so I give up my verses with other toys, and turn all my thoughts to philosophy, following no special school but letting myself be borne along as the breeze may set, now behaving as a true Stoic, being all for action, and now relapsing into the passiveness of a Cyrenaic (1-19).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“With impatience do I await the day when I may devote myself to the serious problems of life; meanwhile I must guide and comfort myself with what little knowledge I possess. A cure for all diseases of the soul may be found in the charms and spells of philosophy, if the patient will but submit to treatment (20-40).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“The first step in virtue and wisdom is to eschew
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 248[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Epistles[/b]
	vice and folly. Men are anxious to avoid poverty and ought to be quite as eager to escape from evil desires, especially as the prize offered is so much greater (41-51).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“True, the world takes a different view, but the children who sing ‘You’ll be king, if you do right’ should teach us how much better than riches is the power to stand erect and free and to fling defiance at Fortune (52-69).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“If I were asked why I do not go along with the world and share its opinions, I should recall the fable of the fox declining the lion’s invitation to enter his den, because the footprints point in only one direction. The man who once gives in to popular opinion becomes the victim of a hydra. Cutting off one head does no good. Men are capricious, and even the same man changes his views from hour to hour (70-93).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“I am as bad as others, but though you are quick to notice some carelessness in my dress or appearance, you fail to observe my graver inconsistencies of life and thought (94-105).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“In short, the Stoics are right: only the sage can be perfect, and even he may suffer from a cold!”

	[b]Epistle I[/b]
	You, of whom my earliest Muse has told,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of whom my last shall tell—you Maecenas, seek to shut me up again in my old school, though well tested in the fray, and already presented with the foil.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] My years, my mind, are not the same. Veianius hangs up his arms at Hercules’ door, then lies hidden in the country, that he may not have to plead with the crowd again and again from the arena’s edge.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Some one there is who is always dinning in my well-rinsed ear: “Be wise in time, and turn loose the ageing horse, lest at the last he stumble amid jeers and burst his wind.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] So now I lay aside my verses and all other toys. What is right and seemly is my study and pursuit, and to that am I wholly given. I am putting by and setting in order the stores on which I may some day draw. Do you ask, perchance, who is my chief, in what home I take shelter? I am not bound, over[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The first Satire, the first Epode, and the first Ode are all addressed to Maecenas.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Horace compares himself to an old gladiator, who has often won approval, and received the wooden foil which was a symbol of discharge from the school of gladiators.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The defeated combatant would beg for his life. Veianius, after his discharge, yielded to no inducements to return to the arena.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]Horace, still using terms applicable to a gladiator, who took an oath to the master of his training-school, is speaking of the acceptance of the formula of some school of philosophy.

	[c dimgray][sup]41[/sup][/c] To flee vice is the beginning of virtue, and to have got rid of folly is the beginning of wisdom. You see with what anxious thought and peril of life you strive to avoid those ills you deem the greatest, a slender fortune and the shame of failure at the polls. Ardent trader that you are, you rush to the furthest Indies, fleeing poverty through sea, through rocks, through flame[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]: but that you may cease to care for the things which you foolishly admire and crave, will you not learn and listen and trust one wiser than yourself? What wrestler in the village games and at the cross-ways would scorn being crowned at the great Olympic games, who had the hope, who had the surety of victory’s palm without the dust?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]52[/sup][/c] Of less worth than gold is silver, than virtue gold. “O citizens, citizens, money you first must seek; virtue after pelf.” This rule the Janus arcade proclaims from top to bottom[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; this is the lesson the old as well as the young are singing, “with slate and satchel slung over the left arm.”[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] You have sense, you have morals, eloquence and honour, but there are six or seven thousands short of the four hundred[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]; you will be in the crowd. Yet boys at play cry; “You’ll be king, if you do right.”[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] Be this our wall of bronze, to have no guilt at heart, no wrongdoing to turn us pale.

	[c dimgray][sup]62[/sup][/c] Tell me, pray, which is better, the Roscian law[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] or the children’s jingle which offers a kingdom to those who “do right” — a jingle once trolled by the manly Curii and Camilli? Does he advise you better, who bids you “make money, money by fair means if you can, if not, by any means money,” and all that you may have a nearer view of the doleful plays of Pupius; or he who, an ever present help. urges and fits you to stand free and erect, and defy scornful Fortune?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]70[/sup][/c] But if the people of Rome should ask me, perchance, why I do not use the same judgements even as I walk in the same colonnades[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] as they, why I do not follow or eschew what they love or hate, I should reply as once upon a time the prudent fox made answer to the sick lion: “Because those foot-prints frighten me;. they all lead toward your den, and none lead back.” You are a many-headed monster-thing. For what am I to follow or whom? Some men rejoice to farm state-revenues; some with titbits and fruits hunt miserly widows,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and net old men to stock their preserves;[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] with many their money grows with interest unobserved.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But let it be that men are swayed by different aims and hobbies; can the same persons persist for one hour in liking the same things? “No bay in the world outshines lovely Baiae.” If so the rich man has said, lake and sea suffer from the eager owner’s fancy; but if a morbid whim has given him the

With what knot can I hold this face-changing Proteus? What of the poor man? Have your laugh! He changes his garret, his bed, his baths, his barber.

You think my madness is the usual thing, and neither laugh at me nor deem that I need a physician or a guardian assigned by the court,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] though you are keeper of my fortunes, and flare up at an ill-pared nail of the friend who hangs upon you and looks to you in all.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles I[/b][/c]
	[b]II[/b]
	[b]To Lollius Maximus[/b]
	The poem is addressed to a young man who is studying rhetoric in Rome, and who, if he is the same Lollius as is addressed in Epistle i. 18, had already served in the Cantabrian war of 25-24 b.c. Horace seeks to interest him in moral philosophy through Homer, whom the ancients perused, as we are told to read the [c dimgray]Apocrypha[/c], “for examples of life and instruction of manners.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet has been reading Homer afresh while in Praeneste, and pronounces him a wiser teacher than all the philosophers. The [c dimgray]Iliad[/c] pictures for us the follies of princes and the sufferings of the people. The [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] shows us the value of courage and self-control. Ulysses is the truly wise man, in contrast with whom the worthless suitors of Penelope or the idle youth at the court of Alcinous are but ciphers, the undistinguished mass of mankind, mere consumers of earth’s products (1-31),
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And such ciphers are we. Surely it is time for us to wake up to the importance of right living and devote ourselves to study and virtue. To put off the day of reform is to be like the clown who waits for the stream to run dry (32-43).
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles I[/b][/c]
	bring health, either of body or of mind. We must clean the inside of the platter and make our hearts sound (44-54).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And so, in a Polonius strain, Horace gives a variety of moral maxims. In this quest of wisdom, the middle-aged poet must pursue his own quiet way, and the youthful Lollius must not expect him to be either too indifferent or too enthusiastic (55-71).

	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles I[/b][/c]
	Epistle II
	While you, Lollius Maximus, declaim[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] at Rome, I have been reading afresh at Praeneste the writer of the Trojan War; who tells us what is fair, what is foul, what is helpful, what not, more plainly and better than Chrysippus or Crantor. Why I have come to think so, let me tell you, unless there is something else to take your attention.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] The story in which it is told how, because of Paris’s love Greece clashed in tedious war with a foreign land, embraces the passions of foolish kings and peoples. Antenor moves to cut away the cause of the war.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] What of Paris? To reign in safety and to live in happiness—nothing, he says, can force him.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Nestor is eager to settle the strife between the sons of Peleus and of Atreus. Love fires one, but anger both in common. Whatever folly the kings commit, the Achaeans pay the penalty. With faction, craft, crime, lust and wrath, within and without the walls of Troy all goes wrong.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] Again, of the power of worth and wisdom he has set before us an instructive pattern in Ulysses,

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c][c dimgray]Cf[/c]. [c dimgray]Iliad[/c], vii. 350, where Antenor urges that the Trojans restore Helen to the Atridae.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]This is, of course, ironical. If we read [c dimgray]quod Paris[/c], [c dimgray]ut[/c] with Bentley, it would go with [c dimgray]cogi[/c], so that, without any irony, Paris would say that he could not be forced into doing that, viz. giving up Helen, in order to reign in safety.

	that tamer of Troy, who looked with discerning eyes upon the cities and manners of many men, and while for self and comrades he strove for a return across the broad seas, many hardships he endured, but could never be o’erwhelmed in the waves of adversity.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] You know the Sirens’ songs and Circe’s cups; if, along with his comrades, he had drunk of these in folly and greed, he would have become the shapeless and witless vassal of a harlot mistress—would have lived as an unclean dog or a sow that loves the mire. We are but ciphers, born to consume earth’s fruits, Penelope’s good-for-naught suitors, young courtiers of Alcinous, unduly busy in keeping their skins sleek, whose pride it was to sleep till midday and to lull care to rest to the sound of the cithern.

Nay, just as, if you won’t take up running in health, you’ll have to do it when dropsical; so, if you don’t call for a book and a light before daybreak, if you don’t devote your mind to honourable studies and pursuits, envy or passion will keep you awake in torment. Why indeed are you in a hurry to remove things which hurt the eye, while if aught is eating into your soul, you put off the time for cure till next year? Well begun is half done; dare to be wise; begin! He who puts off the hour of right living is like the bumpkin waiting for the river to run out: yet on it glides, and on it will glide, rolling its flood forever.

	plough: but he, to whose lot sufficient falls, should covet nothing more. No house or land, no pile of bronze or gold, has ever freed the owner’s sick body of fevers, or his sick mind of cares. The possessor must be sound in health, if he thinks of enjoying the stores he has gathered. To one with fears or cravings, house and fortune give as much pleasure as painted panels to sore eyes, warm wraps to the gout, or citherns to ears that suffer from secreted matter. Unless the vessel is clean, whatever you pour in turns sour.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]55[/sup][/c] Scorn pleasures; pleasure bought with pain is harmful. The covetous is ever in want: aim at a fixed limit for your desires. The envious man grows lean when his neighbour waxes fat; than envy Sicilian tyrants[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] invented no worse torture. He who curbs not his anger will wish that undone which vexation and wrath prompted, as he made haste with violence to gratify his unsated hatred. Anger is short-lived madness. Rule your passion, for unless it obeys, it gives commands. Check it with bridle— check it, I pray you, with chains.

The jar will long keep the fragrance of what it was once steeped in when new.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] But if you lag behind, or with vigour push on ahead, I neither wait for the slow nor press after those who hurry on before.

	The Julius Florus, to whom this Epistle is addressed, and to whom Epistle ii. 2 is later dedicated, was one of a number of young literary men who accompanied Tiberius to the East in 20 b.c., when the prince was sent by Augustus to place Tigranes on the throne of Armenia after the murder of Artaxias. Horace, now forty-five years old, makes kindly inquiries about his younger literary friends, and urges Florus, whatever field of letters he is cultivating, not to neglect philosophy.

And yourself— what do you venture on? About what beds of thyme are you busily flitting? No small gift is yours: not untilled is the field, or rough-grown and unsightly. Whether you sharpen your tongue for pleading, or essay to give advice on civil law, or build charming verse, you will win the first prize of the victor’s ivy.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] But could you but lay aside your cares—those cold compresses[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]—you would rise to where heavenly wisdom would lead. This task, this pursuit let us speed, small and great alike, if we would live dear to our country, and dear to ourselves.

Or does your friendship, like a wound ill-stitched, close vainly and tear open once more?

	[b]IV[/b]
	[b]To Albius Tibullus[/b]
	Albius Tibullus, the elegiac poet, who died the same year as Virgil, 19 b.c., when still quite young, had returned from a campaign in Aquitania in 27 b.c., and then perhaps read for the first time the [c dimgray]Satires[/c] of Horace. As the first verse of this Epistle refers only to the [c dimgray]Satires[/c] and not to the [c dimgray]Odes[/c], this short letter seems to have been written before 23 b.c., when the [c dimgray]Odes[/c] (Books i.-iii.) were published.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Tibullus seems to have been of a sensitive and somewhat melancholy disposition, like the English poet, Thomas Gray. Horace here tries to divert him, and concludes with an invitation to visit him, a prosperous Epicurean, at his Sabine farm.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The commonly accepted view that the Albius here addressed by Horace is the poet Tibullus has been rejected by Cruquius, Baehrens and, more recently, by Professor J. P. Postgate ([c dimgray]Selections from Tibullus[/c], 1903, p. 179). The identity of Albius and Tibullus is upheld by Professor B. L. Ullman in an article on “Horace and Tibullus” in the [c dimgray]American Journal of Philology[/c], xxxiii. (1912) pp. 149 ff., to which Professor Postgate replies briefly in the same volume, pp. 450 ff. Ullman also holds that Tibullus is the [c dimgray]Albi filius[/c] of [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. i. 4.109, written when Tibullus was about sixteen years of age.

	[b]To Torquatus[/b]
	Horace here invites to a simple dinner, on the eve of the birthday of Augustus, a member of the wealthy family of the Manlii Torquati, probably the same as the one to whom the seventh ode of the Fourth Book is later addressed. Torquatus is asked to bring some guests.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As to the hour set for the dinner Porphyrio explains [c dimgray]supremo sole[/c] (1.3) as meaning [c dimgray]hora sexta[/c], [c dimgray]i[/c].[c dimgray]e[/c]. midday, and Professor A. J. Bell favours this interpretation ([c dimgray]Classical Review[/c], xxix. (1915) p. 200. But Horace’s simple dinner is quite unlike the extravagant one given by Nasidienus, which began [c dimgray]de medio die[/c] ([c dimgray]Sat[/c]. ii. 8.3), and people who have spent a hot September in Rome will not think it likely that the sensitive poet would have invited his guests to come at high noon in that unpleasant month. As to the last two lines Torquatus is presumably a busy lawyer, and some of his clients might have to wait till late in the day in order to consult him. If so, this would be another reason why Horace would not expect his friend to come before evening. Maecenas, also a busy man, dined [c dimgray]sub lumina prima[/c] ([c dimgray]Sat[/c]. ii. 7. 33).

	Epistle V
	If you can recline at my table on couches made by Archias,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and are not afraid of “a dinner of herbs” only, from a modest dish, I shall expect you, Torquatus, at my house at sunset. You will drink wine that was bottled in Taurus’s second consulate[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] between marshy Minturnae and Petrinum near Sinuessa. If you have aught better, bid it be sent, or submit to orders. Long has my hearth been bright, and the furniture made neat for you. Dismiss airy hopes and the struggle for wealth, and Moschus’s cause.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] To-morrow, the festal day of Caesar’s birth,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] gives excuse for sleeping late; without penalty shall we be free to prolong the summer night in genial converse.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] Why is fortune mine, if I may not use it? He who, from regard to his heir, pinches and spares overmuch is next door to a madman. I shall begin the drinking and the scattering of flowers, and shall suffer you, if you will, to think me reckless. What a miracle cannot the wine-cup work![c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] It unlocks
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Archias was a maker of unpretentious furniture. According to Porphyrio his couches were small ones. See note on 1.29.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]26 b.c. At that time the wine had been poured from the large [c dimgray]dolium[/c] into the smaller [c dimgray]amphorae[/c].
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]According to the Scholiasts, Moschus, a rhetorician from Pergamum, was accused of poisoning, and defended by Torquatus as well as by Asinius Pollio.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]September 23. September is one of the warmest months in Rome.
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]In [c dimgray]dissignare[/c] the original idea of [c dimgray]sealing[/c] seems to be  negatived by the prefix [c dimgray]dis-[/c], and to “unseal” (a verb appropriately used in the present connexion) signifies (according to Porphyrio) to “open,” [c dimgray]i[/c].[c dimgray]e[/c]. reveal something. Hence it is used of any strange effect. [c dimgray]Cf[/c].

	[c darkmagenta][b]HORACE, Epistles[/b][/c]

	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles I[/b][/c]
	[b]VI[/b]
	[b]To Numicius[/b]
	Nothing is known about the person to whom this letter is addressed, but the ideas expressed in it have made it one of the most famous of Horace’s epistles.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The key-note is struck in the opening phrase, [c dimgray]nil admirari[/c], a rendering of the τὸ μηδὲν θαυμάζειν of Pythagoras, or of ἡ ἀθαυμαστία of philosophers in general (Strabo, i. 3.21). This ἀθαυμαστία, identical with the ἀθαμβία of Democritus (Cic. [c dimgray]De fin[/c]. v. 29.87), the ἀταραξία; of the Epicureans, and the ἀπάθεια of the Stoics, is a philosophic calm, a composure of mind and feeling, a freedom from exciting emotions, which ancient philosophy often regarded as the [c dimgray]summum bonum[/c] and which Tennyson defines so well in his [c dimgray]Lucretius[/c]:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	O thou,
	Passionless bride, divine Tranquillity,
	Yearn’d after by the wisest of the wise,
	Who fail to find thee, being as thou art
	Without one pleasure and without one pain.
	This “wise indifference,” says Horace, is perhaps the only clue to happiness. If men can gaze unmoved on the wonders of the firmament, they can surely look calmly upon things of less moment, such
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 284[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles I[/b][/c]
	as wealth and honours, neither craving their rewards nor fearing their loss. “Nothing in excess” should be one’s rule even in the pursuit of Virtue. And bear in mind that, however much you may long for treasures of art, for fame and wealth, death must be the end of all (1-27).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You think I am wrong? If you are ill, you take medicine; if you want to “live well,” and know that Virtue alone can give you that boon, follow her at all costs. If, on the contrary, you think Virtue a mere name, then make haste to get rioh. Be not like the Cappadocian king, who was so poor, but rather be like Lucullus, who didn’t know how wealthy he was (28-48).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If you have set your heart on office and honours, stoop to all the tricks of the politicians (49-55). If “living well” means for you good eating (56-64) or love and pleasure (65, 66), then think of nothing else.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Such are my views. Have you anything better to offer? (67, 68).

	“Marvel at nothing”—that is perhaps the one and only thing, Numicius, that can make a man happy and keep him so. Yon sun, the stars and seasons that pass in fixed courses—some can gaze upon these with no strain of fear: what think you of the gifts of earth, or what of the sea’s, which makes rich far distant Arabs and Indians—what of the shows, the plaudits and the favours of the friendly Roman —in what wise, with what feelings and eyes think you they should be viewed?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] And he who fears their opposites “marvels” in much the same way as the man who desires: in either case’tis the excitement that annoys, the momentsome unexpected appearance startles either. Whether a man feel joy or grief, desire or fear, what matters it if, when he has seen aught better or worse than he expected, his eyes are fast riveted, and mind and body are benumbed? Let the wise man bear the name of madman, the just of unjust, should he pursue Virtue herself beyond due bounds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] Go now, gaze with rapture on silver plate, antique marble, bronzes and works of art; “marvel” at gems and Tyrian dyes; rejoice that a thousand eyes survey you as you speak; in your diligence get you to the Forum early, to your home late, lest Mutus reap more grain from the lands of his wife’s dower, and (oh the shame, for he sprang from meaner

When Agrippa’s colonnade, when Appius’s way[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] has looked upon your well-known form, still it remains for you to go where Numa and Ancus have gone down before.

Of course a wife and dowry, credit and friends, birth and beauty, are the gift of Queen Cash, and the goddesses Persuasion and Venus grace the man who is well-to-do. The Cappadocian king[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] is rich in slaves, but lacks coin: be not like him. Lucullus,’tis said, was asked if he could lend a hundred cloaks for the stage. “How can I so many?” he answers, “yet I’ll look and send as many as I have.” A little later he writes: “I have five thousand cloaks at home; take some or all.” Poor is the house where there’s not much to spare, much that escapes the master and profits his

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The scholiasts explain [c dimgray]pondera[/c] as the term applied to the high stepping-stones used for crossing the streets as may be seen in Pompeii. Horace, therefore, is picturing the ambitious politicians as hurrying over these to greet a voter on the other side of the street. Other interpretations, such as that [c dimgray]pondera[/c] means the weights on a shop-counter, are pure conjectures.

	[b]To Maecenas[/b]
	Maecenas has apparently reproached Horace for staying in the country longer than he had said he would, when he himself had to remain in Rome, and perhaps he had reminded the poet of his obligations to his patron.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Horace makes a manly and dignified reply. He assures his patron that he is not ungrateful for past benefits, but he must consider his health, and he refuses to surrender his personal independence. If that is demanded, he is willing to give up everything that Maecenas has conferred upon him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The poet’s attitude is illustrated by several stories, the last of which—the tale of Philippus and his client, Volteius Mena—takes up half of the poem. Of this Swift has made a very humorous use in his “Address to the Earl of Oxford.”

	Epistle VII
	Only a week[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] was I to stay in the country—such was my promise—but, false to my word, I am missed the whole of August. And yet, if you would have me live sound and in good health, the indulgence which you grant me when ill you will grant me when I fear to become ill, while the first figs and the heat adorn the undertaker with his black attendants, while every father and fond mother turns pale with fear for the children, and while diligence in courtesies[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and the Forum’s petty business bring on fevers and unseal wills. But if winter shall strew the Alban fields with snow, your poet will go down to the sea, will be careful of himself and, huddled up, will take to his reading: you, dear friend, he will—if you permit—revisit along with the zephyrs and the first swallow.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c]’Twas not in the way a Calabrian host invites you to eat his pears that you have made me rich. “Eat some, pray.” “I’ve had enough.” “Well, take away all you please.” “No, thanks.” “Your tiny tots will love the little gifts you take them.” “I’m as much obliged for your offer as if you sent me away loaded down.” “As you please; you’ll be leaving them for the swine to gobble up to-day.”

	The foolish prodigal gives away what he despises and dislikes: the field thus sown has always yielded, and always will yield, a crop of ingratitude. Your good and wise man claims to be ready to help the worthy, and yet he knows well how coins and counters[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] differ. Worthy I, too, will show myself, as the glory of your good deed demands. But if you will never suffer me to leave you, you must give me back strength of lung, and black locks on a narrow brow[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; you must give back a pleasant prattle, give back graceful laughter and laments amid our cups o’er saucy Cinara’s flight.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c] Once it chanced that a pinched little fox[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] had crept through a narrow chink into a bin of corn, and when well fed was trying with stuffed stomach to get out again, but in vain. To him quoth a weasel hard by: “If you wish to escape from there, you must go back lean to the narrow gap which you entered when lean.” If challenged by this fable, I give up all. I neither praise the poor man’s sleep, when I am fed full on capons, nor would I barter my ease and my freedom for all the wealth of Araby. Often have you praised my modesty, and have been called “king”[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and “father” to your face, nor do I stint my words behind your back. Try me, whether I can restore your gifts, and cheerfully too. ’Twas no poor answer of Telemachus, son of enduring Ulysses[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]: “Ithaca is no land meet for steeds, for
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]

	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Bentley’s conjecture [c dimgray]nitedula[/c], “shrew-mouse,” has been widely accepted, because in real life the fox does not eat grain. But the traditional text must be retained.

	it has no level courses outspread, nor is it lavish of much herbage. Son of Atreus, I will leave you your gifts, as being more meet for you.” Small things befit small folk; my own delight to-day is not queenly Rome, but quiet Tibur or peaceful Tarentum.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]46[/sup][/c] Philippus, the famous pleader, a man of vigour and courage, was returning home from work about two o’clock. Being now somewhat on in years, he was grumbling at the Carinae being too far from the Forum, when (so the story goes) he caught sight of a man close-shaven, sitting in a barber’s empty booth, and with pocket-knife quietly cleaning his nails for himself. “Demetrius” (this lad was not slow to catch his master’s orders), “go, ask, and bring me word, where that man’s from, who he is, and what’s his standing, who is his father, or who his patron.” He goes, and comes back with the tale that his name is Volteius Mena, a crier at auctions, of modest fortune and blameless record, known to work hard and idle in season, to make money and spend it, taking pleasure in his humble friends and a home of his own and, when business is over, in the games and in the field of Mars.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] “I’d like to hear from his own lips all you tell me. Bid him come to supper.” Mena cannot really believe it; he marvels in thoughtful silence. To be brief, “No, thank you,” he answers. “Would he refuse me?” “He does, the rascal, and either slights or dreads you.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]65[/sup][/c] Next morning Philippus comes on Volteius selling cheap odds and ends to the common folk in tunics[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and is first to give a greeting. The other makes work and the ties of his trade an excuse to

	Philippus for not having come to his house that morning,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in fine for not seeing him first. “You’re to take it that I’ve pardoned you only if you sup with me to-day.” “As you please.” “You will come then after three o’clock. Now go, set to and add to your wealth!” On coming to supper, he chatted about anything and everything, and then at last was sent off to bed.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]73[/sup][/c] When he had often been seen to run like a fish to the hidden hook, in the morning a client and now a constant guest, he was invited to come as companion, when the Latin games were proclaimed,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] to a country estate near Rome. Mounted behind the ponies, he is ever praising the Sabine soil and climate. Philippus notes and smiles, and what with looking for his own relief and amusement from any source, and what with giving him seven thousand sesterces, and offering him a loan of seven thousand more, he persuades him to buy a little farm. He does so. Not to hold you too long with a rambling tale, our spruce cit becomes a rustic and chatters about nothing but furrows and vineyards, makes ready his elms, nearly kills himself over his hobbies, and grows old with his passion for getting. But when he has lost his sheep by theft and his goats by disease, when his crops have fooled his hopes and his ox is worn to death with ploughing, fretting over his losses, in the middle of the night he seizes his nag and in a rage makes straight for the house of Philippus. He, soon as he saw him, rough and unshorn, “Volteius,” cries he, “you seem to me too hard-worked and over-strained.” “Egad! my patron,” said he, “you would call me miserable wretch, if you could give me my true name.

	To Celsus Albinovanus greetings and good wishes! This message bear, O Muse, at my request, to the comrade and secretary of Nero. If he ask you how I fare, tell him that despite many fine promises I live a life neither wise nor pleasant; not because hail has beaten down my vines and heat blighted my olives, nor because my herds are sickening on distant pastures; but because, less sound in mind than in all my body, I will listen to nothing, will learn nothing, to relieve my sickness; quarrel with my faithful physicians, and angrily ask my friends why they are eager to rescue me from fatal lethargy; because I follow after what has hurt me, avoid what I believe will help me, and am fickle as the wind, at Rome loving Tibur, at Tibur Rome.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then ask him how his own health is, how in estate and person he is faring, how he stands in favour with prince and staff. If he says “Well,” first wish him joy; then by and by remember to drop this warning in the dear fellow’s ears: “As you bear your fortune, Celsus, so we shall bear with you.”

	Epistle IX
	Only Septimius of course understands how much, Claudius, you make of me. For when he begs and by prayer forces me—mark you!—to an endeavour to commend and present him to you, as one worthy of the mind and household of Nero, the lover of virtue—when he deems that I fill the place of a closer friend, he sees and knows what I can do more fully than myself. To be sure I gave him many reasons for letting me go excused; but I feared that I might be thought to have made out my influence too small, falsely hiding my real power and seeking favour for myself alone. So to avoid the reproach of a graver fault, I have stooped to win the reward of town-bred impudence. But if you approve of my thus doffing modesty at the bidding of a friend, enrol him in your circle and believe him brave and good.

	[b]To Aristius Fusgus[/b]
	According to the scholiasts, Aristius Fuscus, to whom this letter is addressed, was a dramatic writer and a scholar. He appears in the list of Horace’s literary friends given in [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. i. 10.83, figures in an amusing rôle in [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. i. 9.61 ff., and is best known as the man to whom the famous [c dimgray]Integer vitae[/c] ode ([c dimgray]Carm[/c]. i. 22) is dedicated.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Epistle is a rhapsody upon the simplicity and charm of country life addressed to a cultivated man of the town. In the country Horace is perfectly content, save for the fact that his friend is elsewhere.

One whom Fortune’s smiles have delighted overmuch, will reel under the shock of change. If you set your heart on aught, you will be loth to lay it down.

So he who through fear of poverty forfeits liberty, which is better than mines of wealth, will in his avarice carry a master, and be a slave for ever, not knowing how to live on little. When a man’s fortune will not fit him, ’tis as ofttimes with a shoe—if too big for the foot, it will trip him; if too small, will chafe.

	What did you think of Chios, my Bullatius, and of famous Lesbos? What of charming Samos? What of Sardis, royal home of Croesus? What of Smyrna and Colophon? Whether above or below their fame, do they all seem poor beside the Campus and Tiber’s stream? Or is your heart set upon one of the cities of Attalus?[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Or do you extol Lebedus, because sick of sea and roads?

	Horace introduces Grosphus to Iccius, and in doing so takes occasion to rally his friend on his discontent.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Iccius, whom in one of his [c dimgray]Odes[/c] (i. 29) Horace rallies for deserting philosophy to take part in a military expedition to Arabia Felix, has now, some five years later, become the [c dimgray]procurator[/c] or “agent,” who had charge of Agrippa’s estates in Sicily. Apparently he had written to Horace, grumbling because he was not an independent landowner, to which Horace replies that the agent of a large estate is able to live on the produce very comfortably, inasmuch as it is all at his disposal, though he is not the actual owner. Then in a somewhat ironical vein (12-20), Horace congratulates his friend on being able, amid all his business cares, to study the physics of Empedocles and the dialectic of the Stoics.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The letter closes with some bits of news, preceded by the request to show some courtesy to Pompeius Grosphus, whom we have also encountered in the [c dimgray]Odes[/c] (ii. 16), where he is spoken of as a wealthy proprietor in Sicily.

	If, Iccius, you are enjoying as you should the Sicilian products which you collect for Agrippa, Jupiter himself could not give you greater abundance. Away with complaints; for he is not poor, who has enough of things to use. If stomach, lungs, and feet are all in health, the wealth of kings can give you nothing more. If haply you hold aloof from what is within your reach, and live on nettles and other greens, you will go on living in the same way, though Fortune’s stream suddenly flood you with gold: either because money cannot change your nature, or because you count all else below the one thing, virtue.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c] Yet, that you may not be ignorant how the world wags in Rome, the Cantabrian has fallen before the valour of Agrippa, the Armenian before that of Claudius Nero.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]According to the scholiast, fish are here mentioned as costly fare in contrast to a simple diet. In [c dimgray]trucidas[/c], however, Horace makes a humorous allusion to the Pythagoreans, whom Empedocles followed in regard to the doctrine of transmigration of souls, for he asserted that he himself had once been a fish (εἰν ἁλὶ ἔλλοπος ἰχθύς, Fr. 11 Müll.). To eat a fish, therefore, might mean murder. This ban on living things was extended even to vegetables, [c dimgray]Cf[/c]. [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. ii. 6.63 above, and Juvenal’s well-known verse porrum et caepe nefas violare et frangere morsu (15.9), with Mayor’s note.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The Cantabrians were conquered by Agrippa in 19 b.c., shortly after Armenia had submitted to Tiberius. In connexion with the latter event, Phraates, the Parthian king, restored the Roman standards taken long before from Crassus at Carrhae.

	Horace is sending Augustus a copy of his poems, probably the [c dimgray]Odes[/c], Books i., ii., iii., which were published in 23 b.c. The volume is carried to court by a messenger, one Vinius, whose cognomen is presumably Asina (1.8), though the usual form of the name is Asellus.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Instead of writing a formal note to the Emperor to accompany the gift, Horace indulges in the fiction of sending a letter of instructions to the messenger, in which he humorously expresses his anxiety about the reception of the poems.

	Put forth your strength over hills, streams, and fens; when once you have achieved your purpose and reached your journey’s end, you are to keep your burden so placed as not, for instance, to carry the little packet of books under your armpit, even as a bumpkin carries a lamb, as tipsy Pyrria a ball of stolen wool,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] as a poor tribesman his slippers and felt cap, when asked out to dinner.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] And mind you don’t tell all the world that you have sweated in carrying verses that may win a hold on the eyes and ears of Caesar.

	[b]To The Bailiff Of His Farm[/b]
	This epistle is professedly addressed to the slave, whom the poet had promoted from low rank in his town establishment to the position of bailiff or superintendent of his small country estate. The slave now hankers after city life, while the master, detained in Rome by a friend’s bereavement, longs for the country, which he has always preferred. The difference between the two is due to their tastes. The slave still clings to his follies; the master has learned wisdom with advancing years.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The theme is essentially the same as in Epistles viii. and x. of this book, while the setting of the letter is in marked contrast with [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. ii. 7, where it is the slave who lectures the master.

	Bailiff of my woods and of the little farm which makes me myself again—while you disdain it, though the home of five households and wont to send to Varia their five honest heads[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—let us have a match to see whether I more stoutly root out thorns from the mind or you from the land, and whether Horace or his farm is in a better state.

I call him happy who lives in the country; you him who dwells in the city. One who likes another’s lot, of course dislikes his own. Each is foolish and unfairly blames the undeserving place; what is at fault is the mind, which never escapes from itself.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] You, as a common drudge, used to sigh in secret for the country; now as a bailiff you long for the town, its games and baths: as for me, you know that I’m consistent with myself, and depart in gloom, whenever hateful business drags me to Rome. Our tastes are not the same: therein lies the difference between you and me. What you hold to be desert and inhospitable wilds, he who shares my views calls

And yet[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] you toil over fields long untouched by the hoe, you care for the ox after he is unyoked, and you fill him up with fodder you have stripped; when you are dead tired, the brook brings fresh work, for if rain has fallen, it must be taught by many a mounded dam to spare the sunny meadow.

One whom fine-spun clothes became, and shining locks, one who, as you know, though empty-handed, found favour with greedy Cinara, and in midday hours would drink the clear Falernian, now takes pleasure in a simple meal, and a nap on the grass beside the stream: nor is it shameful to have once been foolish, but not to cut folly short. Where you live, no one with eye askance detracts from[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] my comforts, or poisons them with the bite of secret hate. As I move sods and stones the neighbours laugh. You would rather be munching rations with the slaves in town; it is their number you fain would join: my sharp-witted groom envies you the use of fuel, flock, and garden. The ox longs for the horse’s trappings: the horse, when lazy, longs to plough. What I shall advise is that each contentedly practise the trade he understands.

	[b]To Vala[/b]
	Ordered by his physician to take the cold-water cure, Horace writes to his friend Vala for information about two seaside places, Velia and Salernum, especially as to the climate, people, drinking water, game, and fish. As such an interest in personal luxuries may seem quite inconsistent with doctrines he has often preached, Horace humorously admits that he is like the well-known Maenius, who would loudly proclaim the blessings of a simple life, but, if he had the chance, would indulge his appetite to the full.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The opening paragraph (1-25) is loosely framed, with lengthy parentheses, giving an air of careless freedom of style, after the fashion of conversation in real life. Numonius Vala, who had a country house in southern Italy, belonged to a family of some distinction in Lucania, as is evidenced by coins and inscriptions.

	What’s the winter like, my Vala, at Velia, what’s the climate at Salernum, what sort of people live there, what kind of road is it—for Antonius Musa makes Baiae useless to me, and yet[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] puts me in ill favour there, now that in midwinter I drench myself in cold water. Of course the town murmurs at its myrtle-groves being deserted, and its sulphur baths despised, so famous for driving a lingering disorder from the sinews, and takes offence at invalids who dare to plunge head and stomach under the showers from Clusium’s springs, or who repair to Gabii and its cold country-side. I must change my resort, and drive my horse past the familiar lodgings. “Where are you going? I’m not bound for Cumae or Baiae”; so will the rider say as he tugs in anger at the left rein—but the horse’s ear is in its bridled mouth[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—which town has the better supply of food, do they drink rain-water from tanks, or have they spring-water, welling forth all the year—(for that region’s wines I put out of court: in my country home I can stand and suffer anything; but when I go to the seaside I need something generous and mellow, to drive care away, to flow with rich hope into veins and heart, to find me a flow of words, and to give me the grace of youth with the ladies of Lucania)—

	which country rears more hares, which, more boars, which one’s seas give more hiding to fish and seaurchins, so that I may return home from there a fat Phaeacian[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—all this you must write us, and we must credit you in full.

	[c dimgray][sup]26[/sup][/c] Maenius gallantly used up all his mother and father had left him, then came into note as a city wit, a parasite at large, with no fixed fold, a man who when dinnerless knew not friend apart from foe, but would savagely trump up scandal against anybody, the market’s ruin, a cyclone and abyss[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—and so, whatever he gained, he gave to his greedy maw. This fellow, whenever he got little or nothing from those who applauded or feared his wicked wit, would sup on plates of tripe and cheap lamb, enough to satisfy three bears, so as actually to proclaim that prodigals should have their bellies branded with white-hot iron—he, a Bestius reformed![c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Yet the same man, if he ever got hold of some larger booty, would turn it into smoke and ashes, and then, “In faith, I don’t wonder,” he would say, “if some devour their substance, since there is nothing better than a fat thrush, nothing finer than a large sow’s paunch.”

	[c dimgray][sup]42[/sup][/c] Such a man, in truth, am I.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles I[/b][/c]
	[b]XVI[/b]
	[b]To Quinctius[/b]
	The Quinctius addressed may be Quinctius Hirpinus of [c dimgray]Odes[/c] ii. 11. He is evidently a prominent man (1.18), who is perhaps in public office (11.33. 34), but nothing definite is known about him. The Epistle is the poet’s commentary on the second Stoic paradox, ὅτι αὐτάρκης ἡ ἀρετὴ πρὸς εὐδαιμονίαν (Cic. [c dimgray]Parad[/c]. 2).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	To save you the trouble of asking about the products of my estate, my dear Quinctius, let me describe it to you. It lies in a valley among the hills, gets plenty of sun, has a good climate, grows an abundance of wild fruit and foliage, and possesses a copious spring of fresh water. In this charming retreat I enjoy good health even in the worst season of the year (1-16).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And now about yourself. Are you really the good and happy man that people think you are? Remember that popular applause is fickle, and often insincere, and that those who give titles can also take them away (17-40).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Well, who is the “good” man? The world will answer that it is he who keeps the laws, whose word is a bond and whose testimony is trusted, but those who live near him may know better. Such a man,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 348[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles I[/b][/c]
	eager to [c dimgray]seem[/c] good, but not to [c dimgray]be[/c] good, may be no better than the slave, who refrains from stealing merely from fear of being found out (40-62).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The man who has set his heart on money is a creature of desires and fears. He is a deserter from the cause of Virtue. You might treat him as a prisoner or put him to death, yet he may make a useful slave (63-72).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	No, the truly good and wise man will be as fearless and independent as Dionysus in the play, for no misfortunes—not death itself—can daunt him (73-79).

	Lest you, my good Quinctius, should have to ask me about my farm, whether it supports its master with plough-land, or makes him rich with olives, whether with apples or with meadows or vine-clad elms,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] I will describe for you in rambling style the nature and lie of the land.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] There are hills, quite unbroken, were they not cleft by one shady valley,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] yet such that the rising sun looks on its right side, and when departing in his flying car warms the left. The climate would win your praise. What if you knew that the bushes bear a rich crop of ruddy cornels and plums, that oak and ilex gladden the cattle with plenteous fruitage, and their lord with plenteous shade? You would say that Tarentum with its verdure was brought nearer home. A spring, too, fit to give its name to a river, so that not cooler nor purer is Hebrus winding through Thrace, flows with healing for sickly heads and sickly stomachs. This retreat, so sweet—yes, believe me, so bewitching—keeps me, my friend, in sound health in September’s heat.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Ancient husbandry was chiefly concerned with five products, viz. grain, oil, fruit, cattle, and wine.

Kiessling prefers the rival reading [c dimgray]si dissocientur[/c], with [c dimgray]temperiem laudes[/c] the main clause in a conditional sentence, meaning: “if you picture a mass of hills broken by a valley, you may imagine how pleasant the climate is.”

	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] And you—you live the true life, if you take care to be what people call you. All we in Rome have long talked of you as happy; but I fear, as touching yourself, that you may give more credit to others than to your own judgement, or that you may think someone other than the wise and good man can be happy; or that, if over and over men say you are in sound and good health, you may, toward the dinner-hour, disguise the hidden fever, until a trembling falls upon your greasy hands.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Fools, through false shame, hide the unhealed sore.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c] Suppose a man were to speak of wars fought by you on land and sea, and with words like these flatter your attentive ears:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	May He, to whom both thou and Rome are dear,
	Keep secret still, which is the fuller truth,
	The love of Rome for thee, or thine for her!
	you would see in them the praises of Augustus.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] When you suffer yourself to be called wise and flawless, do you answer, pray tell me, in your own name? “To be sure, I like to be called a good man and wise, even as you do.” But they who gave you this title to-day will, if they so please, take it away to-morrow; even as, if they bestow the lictor’s rods on one unworthy, they will likewise wrest them from him. “Put that down, ’tis ours,” they say. I do so, and sadly withdraw. If the same people were to cry after me “Thief!”, call me “Profligate,” insist that I strangled my father, ought I to be stung by such lying charges, and change colour? Whom does false honour delight, whom does lying calumny affright, save the man who is full of flaws and needs the doctor?

If a slave were to say to me, “I never stole or ran away”: my reply would be, “You have your reward; you are not flogged.” “I never killed anyone.” “You’ll hang on no cross to feed crows.” “I am good and honest.” Our Sabine friend[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] shakes his head and says, “No, no!” For the wolf is wary and dreads the pit, the hawk the suspected snare, the pike the covered hook.

Suppose there’s a hope of escaping detection; you will make no difference between sacred and profane. For when from a thousand bushels of beans you steal one, my loss in that case is less, but not your sin. This “good man,” for forum and tribunal the cynosure of every eye, whenever with swine or ox he makes atonement to the gods, cries with loud voice “Father Janus,” with loud voice “Apollo,” then moves his lips, fearing to be heard: “Fair Laverna,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] grant me to escape detection; grant me to pass as just and upright, shroud my sins in night, my lies in clouds!”

	the copper fastened there,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] I do not see: for he who covets will also have fears; further, he who lives in fear, will never, to my mind, be free.

When you can sell a captive,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] don’t kill him: he will make a useful slave.

	The subject of this and the following Epistle is personal independence, as illustrated in the relations of patron and [c dimgray]protégé[/c]. Horace’s own happy connexion with Maecenas, which he sets forth so admirably in [c dimgray]Epist[/c]. i. 7, furnished him with an experience which possibly led others to seek his advice as to their conduct toward men of high station. As to Scaeva, however, nothing is known about him, and it is quite possible that there was no such person in real life, but that the name was chosen to fit an assumed character, it being the same as σκαιός, “awkward” or “[c dimgray]gauche[/c].”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After disclaiming any peculiar right to give advice on such a subject (1-5), and assuring Scaeva that if he really wants to live a quiet, comfortable life, he should retire from Rome altogether (6-10), Horace proceeds in reality to defend himself against the attacks made on him as a sycophant of the great. He therefore contrasts the conduct of the Cyrenaic Aristippus, who had plenty of [c dimgray]savoir faire[/c] and could adapt himself to any circumstances, with the less sensible behaviour of Diogenes, the boorish Cynic, who courted the common people and knew how to live only amid sordid surroundings (13-32). To

	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles I[/b][/c]
	gain distinction in life oneself is the highest ambition, but it is also no mean achievement to win favour with the great. He who succeeds in doing so is a true man and plays a manly part (33-42).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Here the tone abruptly changes, and in the last twenty lines (43-62) Horace lays down rules which the young aspirant for favour is supposed to follow. In this part the poet is far from serious, but, after his fashion, is indulging in good-natured irony.

	Even though, Scaeva, you look after your own interests quite wisely by yourself, though you know on what terms, in fine, one should handle greater folk, yet learn the views of your humble friend, who still needs some teaching. It is as if a blind man sought to show the way; yet see whether even I have aught to say, which you may care to make your own.

For this is the way, as the story goes, that he dodged the snapping cynic: “I

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]According to the Epicurean precept, λάθε βιώσας.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]This remark is made by Diogenes the Cynic. The story referred to is found in Diogenes Laertius, ii. 8.68. The Cynic was cleaning vegetables for dinner, when Aristippus passed by. Said the former: “if you had learned to put up with this, you would not be courting princes.” To this gibe Aristippus replied, “and you, if you knew how to consort with men, would not be cleaning greens.”

I do service that I may have a horse to ride and be fed by a prince: you sue for paltry doles; but you become inferior to the giver, though you pose as needing no man.” To Aristippus every form of life was fitting, every condition and circumstance; he aimed at higher things, but as a rule was content with what he had. On the other hand, take the man whom endurance clothes with its double rags[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]: I shall marvel if a changed mode of life befit him. The one will not wait for a purple mantle; he will put on anything and walk through the most crowded streets, and in no inelegant fashion will play either part. The other will shun a cloak woven at Miletus as worse than a dog or a snake, and will die of cold if you do not give him back his rags. Give them back and let him live his uncouth life.

It makes a difference whether you take modestly or snatch greedily. And yet this[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] was the head and front of all. “My sister has no dower, my poor mother is a beggar, my farm is neither salable nor able to support us.” He who so speaks, cries aloud, “Give us food.” His neighbour chimes in with “me too.” So the gift will be divided and the morsel split.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] But if the crow could feed in quiet, he would have more meat, and much less wrangling and envy.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

And he who has once been fooled does not care to lift up at the crossings a beggar with a broken leg, though many a tear flow down his cheeks, though he swear by holy Osiris and cry: “Believe me, I’m in earnest; cruel men, lift up the lame!” “Look for a stranger,” the neighbours bawl back till they are hoarse.

	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles I[/b][/c]
	[b]XVIII[/b]
	[b]To Lollius[/b]
	A true friend, Lollius, never plays the parasite, yet on the other hand never shows his independence by rudeness or by insistence upon trifles (1-20).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As [c dimgray]protégé[/c], you must not try to emulate your patron in his ostentation or other weaknesses, for you will merely earn his contempt or hatred. Neither should you pry into his secrets, though if he entrust any to you you must keep them faithfully (21-38).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Do not emphasize your own tastes in contrast with your patron’s. If he wishes to go a-hunting, put your books aside, even as Amphion gave up the lyre to humour Zethus. The sport will whet your appetite; it is a national pastime and you have always been a good athlete and soldier. You have been cheered on the Campus Martius, and crowds have witnessed your mimic reproduction of the Battle of Actium (39-66).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Be discreet in your criticism of others; covet not your patron’s slaves; be careful to introduce only people who will not humiliate you later, but should you make a mistake, don’t fail to acknowledge it, so that, if necessary, you may be able to defend those who really deserve your aid. Remember that some day you yourself may be bitten by the tooth of
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 366[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles I[/b][/c]
	slander. A [c dimgray]protégé[/c], you see, must be ever watchful of his conduct. He must fall in with his patron’s moods and at all times show a cheery face (67-95).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Above all, you must study the words of the wise and learn the secret of a tranquil life. That is what [c dimgray]I[/c] have found in my peaceful country home, where I pray the gods for the blessings of life, for the means of living, and for a goodly supply of books. The [c dimgray]aequus animus[/c] I will see to myself (96-112).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This Epistle is addressed to the Lollius whom we have already met in the second Epistle of this book. Yet the main theme of the letter is the same as that already treated in the seventeenth, viz. the manner in which a person should conduct himself in his intercourse with the great. Lollius, however, is not what Scaeva is conceived to have been, poor and of lowly station. He has an ancestral estate, large enough to be the scene of an historical pageant, and he was probably the son of the Lollius who was Consul in 21 b.c. ([c dimgray]cf[/c]. [c dimgray]Epist[/c]. i. 20.28).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is commonly supposed that the young Lollius is thinking of attaching himself to a man of great prominence in the state, with whom he would be on terms of confidential intimacy (11.37 f.; 68 ff.), and that he has consulted Horace, who has himself been so successful with a patron. But most commentators take the letter too seriously. It is a satire and the poet is in a playful mood (see [c dimgray]e.g[/c]. 11.72 ff.). So, under the guise of a Professor of Social Philosophy, he gives his young friend a lecture in Stoic fashion on his favourite theme [c dimgray]bene vivere[/c], which here may be taken to mean “How to get on in the world.”

	If I know you well, my Lollius, most outspoken of men, you will shrink from appearing in the guise of a parasite[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] when you have professed the friend. As matron and mistress will differ in temper and tone, so will the friend be distinct from the faithless parasite. There is a vice the opposite of this—perhaps a greater one—a clownish rudeness, awkward and offensive, which commends itself by scraped skin and black teeth, while fain to pass for simple candour and pure virtue. Virtue is a mean between vices,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] remote from both extremes. The one man, over-prone to servility, a jester of the lowest couch,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] so reveres the rich man’s nod, so echoes his speeches, and picks up his words as they fall, that you would think a schoolboy was repeating his lessons to a stern master or a mime-player acting a second part.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] The other man wrangles often about goat’s wool,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and donning his armour fights for trifles: “To think, forsooth, that I should not find credence first, or that I should not blurt out strongly what I really think!

	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] The man whom ruinous passion or desperate gambling strips bare, whom vanity dresses up and perfumes beyond his means, who is possessed by an insatiate hunger and thirst for money, by the shame and dread of poverty, his rich friend, though often ten times as well equipped with vices, hates and abhors; or if he does not hate him schools him and like a fond mother would have him wiser and more virtuous than himself. He says to him what is pretty nearly true: “My wealth—don’t try to rival me—allows of folly: your means are but trifling. A narrow toga befits a client of sense; cease to vie with me.” Eutrapelus, if he wished to injure someone, would give him costly clothes: “for now,” said he, “the happy fellow will, together with his fine tunics, put on new plans and hopes, will sleep till dawn, will postpone honest business for a wanton, will swell his debts, and at last will become a gladiator, or the hired driver of a greengrocer’s nag.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]37[/sup][/c] You will never pry into your patron’s secrets, and if one is entrusted to you, you will keep it, though wine or anger puts you on the rack. Again, you will neither praise your own tastes, nor find fault with those of others, nor when your friend would go a-hunting, will you be penning poems.’Twas so that the brotherly bond between the twins Amphion and Zethus parted asunder, till the lyre, on which the stern one looked askance, was hushed.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Amphion, ’tis thought, yielded to his brother’s mood: do you yield to your great friend’s gentle biddings;

	[c dimgray][sup]67[/sup][/c] To continue my advice, if you need advice in aught—think often of what you say, and of whom, and to whom you say it. Avoid a questioner, for he is also a tattler. Open ears will not keep secrets loyally, and the word once let slip flies beyond recall. Let no maid or boy within your worshipful friend’s marble threshold inflame your heart, lest the owner of the pretty boy or dear girl make you happy with a present so trifling or torment you if disobliging. What sort of a person you introduce, consider again and again, lest by and by the other’s failings strike you with shame. At times we err and present someone unworthy: therefore, if taken in, forbear to defend him whose own fault drags him down, in order that, if charges assail one you know thoroughly, you may watch over and protect the man who relies on your championship. For when he is nibbled at with Theon’s tooth[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of slander, don’t you feel that a little later the peril will pass to yourself? ’Tis your own safety that’s at stake, when your neighbour’s wall is in flames, and fires neglected are wont to gather strength.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]86[/sup][/c] Those who have never tried think it pleasant to court a friend in power; one who has tried dreads it. While your barque is on the deep, see to it lest the breeze shift and bear you back. The grave dislike the gay, the merry the grave, the quick the staid, the lazy the stirring man of action: drinkers \[who quaff Falernian in midnight hours\][c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] hate the man who declines the proffered cups, however much you swear that you dread fevers at night.

	[b]To Maecenas[/b]
	Writing shortly before the publication of this book, in 20 b.c., Horace replies to the adverse criticism which had been levelled against his [c dimgray]Epodes[/c] and [c dimgray]Odes[/c] (Books i.-iii.). These, it was claimed, lacked originality and were mere imitations of Greek exemplars. Horace therefore contrasts the rude and servile imitation, to which he has himself been subjected, with his own generous use of noble models, according to rules followed by the great Greek poets themselves (1-34).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But the real reason why Horace has been assailed lies in the fact that the poet has not tried to please the general public or his offended critics. He refuses to resort to the usual methods of winning approval, and is therefore supposed to be arrogant. This is a charge which he declines to face (35-49).

	Epistle XIX
	If you follow old Cratinus,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] my learned Maecenas, no poems can please long, nor live, which are written by water-drinkers. From the moment Liber enlisted brain-sick poets among his Satyrs and Fauns, the sweet Muses, as a rule, have had a scent of wine about them in the morning. Homer, by his praises of wine, is convicted as a winebibber.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Even Father Ennius never sprang forth to tell of arms save after much drinking.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] “To the sober I shall assign the Forum and Libo’s Well[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]; the stern I shall debar from song.” Ever since I put forth this edict,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] poets have never ceased to vie in wine-drinking by night, to reek of it by day. What, if a man were to ape Cato with grim and savage look, with bare feet and the cut of a scanty gown, would he thus set before us Cato’s virtue and morals? In coping with Timagenes, his tongue brought ruin to Iarbitas[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]; so keen was his aim and effort to be deemed a man of

	[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]The precise meaning of [c dimgray]rupit[/c] is uncertain. Porphyrio takes it literally, as if the attempt to rival the eloquence of Timagenes (a rhetorician of the day) made Iarbitas “burst asunder.” More probably the word has the general sense of “ruined.”

	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] I was the first to plant free footsteps on a virgin soil; I walked not where others trod. Who trusts himself will lead and rule the swarm. I was the first to show to Latium the iambics[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] of Paros, following the rhythms and spirit of Archilochus, not the themes or the words that hounded Lycambes. And lest you should crown me with a scantier wreath because I feared to change the measures and form of verse, see how manlike[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Sappho moulds her Muse by the rhythm of Archilochus; how Alcaeus moulds his, though in his themes and arrangement he differs, looking for no father-in-law to besmear with deadly verses, and weaving no halter for his bride[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] with defaming rhyme. Him, never before sung by other lips, I, the lyrist of Latium, have made known.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] It is my joy that I bring things untold before, and am read by the eyes and held in the hands of the gently born.

	[b]Book II[/b]
	[b]I[/b]
	[b]To Augustus[/b]
	In his [c dimgray]Life of Horace[/c], Suetonius tells us that the poet composed this Epistle for Augustus after the emperor, on reading certain of his [c dimgray]Sermones[/c], had complained because none of them were addressed to him: “Augustus scripta quidem eius usque adeo probavit . . . ut . . . post sermones vero quosdam lectos nullam sui mentionem habitam ita sit questus: ‘irasci me tibi scito, quod non in plerisque eiusmodi scriptis mecum potissimum loquaris. An vereris ne apud posteros infame tibi sit, quod videaris familiaris nobis esse?’ Expressitque eclogam ad se cuius initium est [c dimgray]cum tot sustineas[/c],”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] etc. It is quite improbable that the [c dimgray]sermones[/c] here referred to are either the [c dimgray]Satires[/c], which were published sixteen years earlier, or the First Book of [c dimgray]Epistles[/c], published some
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]“Augustus appreciated his writings so highly that, after reading some of his [c dimgray]Sermones[/c] and finding no mention therein of himself, he sent him this complaint: ‘Know that I am angry with you, because in your several writings of this type you do not address me—me above all. Is it your fear that posterity may deem it to your discredit, that you seem to be intimate with me?’ And so he wrung from the poet the selection addressed to him, beginning [c dimgray]cum tot sustineas[/c].”

	six years before They must be the [c dimgray]Epistles[/c] addressed to Floras (ii. 2), and to the Pisones ([c dimgray]Ars Poetica[/c]), the present Epistle, therefore, being the latest of the three in composition.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Burdened as you are, O Caesar, with cares of State, you must not be approached by me in a long discourse (1-4).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Unlike the demigods of story, whose benefits to mankind were recognized only after death, your great services to the world are acknowledged in your lifetime (5-17), but this principle is not elsewhere applied by the Romans to contemporary merit, for they admire only what is ancient, and defend their attitude on the ground that the best works of the Greeks were their earliest (18-33). But how can a line be drawn strictly between ancient and modern (34-49)?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Take a list of the older poets, and note how secure they are in the reputation assigned them by the critics. Ennius, for example, their “second Homer,” cares little whether the promises of his Pythagorean dreams are fulfilled. Naevius is as familiar to us as if he were a recent writer. So with Pacuvius and Accius in tragedy; Afranius, Plautus, Caecilius, and Terence in comedy (50-62).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This admiration should be more discriminating, for these early writers are far from perfect and often call for our indulgence rather than our approval. It is really envy of contemporary merit that accounts for this undue praise of the old writers and a depreciation of the new (63-89).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	How different was the attitude of the Greeks toward novelty! Once rid of war, they turned like children from one amusement to another—athletics,

	sculpture, painting, music, and tragedy, but in Rome we have been more serious, devoting ourselves to practical affairs, and only now, in these late days, turning to the writing of verses, as I am doing myself (90-117).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This craze is not without its advantages. Poets are free from many vices. They promote the education of the young and serve the cause of religion (118-138). Let us look at the history of dramatic poetry. Beginning with rude Fescennine verses, whose scurrility had to be checked by law, it came under the refining influence of Greek art, which led to the almost complete elimination of the earlier rusticity (139-160). For tragedy the Romans have a natural aptitude, but they lack the finishing touch. Comedy is supposed to involve less labour, but for that very reason failure can not be so easily excused. Plautus, for instance, is careless and slipshod, being more anxious to fill his purse than to write good plays (161-176). The dramatic writer depends for success upon his audience, and therefore I renounce the stage. The masses call for bears and boxers, and even the educated care more for what delights the restless eye than for good drama. If Democritus were alive to-day, he would laugh, not at the scene on the stage, but at the audience, who applaud the actor before he utters a word, simply because of his fine clothes (177-207)! Yet don’t suppose that I undervalue an art which I cannot handle, for to me a great dramatic poet, who can move my soul with his airy creations, is a wondrous magician (208-213).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I pray you, O Caesar, to bestow a share of your patronage on those who write, not for spectators; but for readers (214-218).

	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles II[/b][/c]
	We poets, I know, often behave foolishly. We are tactless, over-sensitive to criticism, and expect too much consideration. But, after all, great merits call for great poets to celebrate them. Alexander was a good judge of painting and sculpture, but in poetry his taste was Boeotian, for he paid the wretched Choerilus for his poor verses. You, on the contrary, have chosen Virgil and Varius to sing your exploits, and you know that no sculptor reproduces the features of heroes more faithfully than the poet does their souls (219-250). If I could do so, I should much prefer to sing your exploits, but you are worthy of a greater poet, and I will not run the risk of bringing discredit upon you as well as upon myself. I should no more like to have a poor waxen portrait of myself offered for sale than to be sung in uncouth verses which sooner or later must come to an ignoble end, and provide wrapping material in a grocer’s shop (250-270)!

	Seeing that you alone carry the weight of so many great charges, guarding our Italian state with arms, gracing her with morals,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and reforming her with laws, I should sin against the public weal if with long talk, O Caesar, I were to delay your busy hours.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]5[/c]Romulus, father Liber, Pollux and Castor, who, after mighty deeds, were welcomed into the temples of the gods, so long as they had care for earth and human kind, settling fierce wars, assigning lands, and founding towns, lamented that the goodwill hoped for matched not their deserts. He[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] who crushed the fell Hydra and laid low with fated toil the monsters of story found that Envy is quelled only by death that comes at last. For a man scorches with his brilliance who outweighs merits lowlier than his own, yet he, too, will win affection when his light is quenched. Upon you, however, while still among us, we bestow honours betimes, set up altars[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] to swear by in your name, and confess that nought like you will hereafter arise or has arisen ere now.

	above Greek leaders, judges all other things by a wholly different rule and method, and scorns and detests all save what it sees has passed from earth and lived its days. So strong is its bias toward things ancient, that the Tables[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] forbidding transgression, which the ten men enacted, treaties in which our kings made equal terms with Gabii[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] or the sturdy Sabines, the Pontiffs’ records,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] the mouldy scrolls of seers[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]—these, it tells us over and over, were spoken by the Muses on the Alban mount.

	[c dimgray]34[/c]If poems are like wine which time improves, I should like to know what is the year that gives to writings fresh value. A writer who dropped off a hundred years ago, is he to be reckoned among the perfect and ancient, or among the worthless and modern? Let some limit banish disputes. “He is ancient,” you say, “and good, who completes a hundred years.” “What of one who passed away a month or a year short of that, in what class is he to be reckoned? The ancient poets, or those whom to-day and to-morrow must treat with scorn? “He

	[c dimgray]50[/c]Ennius,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] the wise and valiant, the second Homer (as the critics style him), seems to care but little what becomes of his promises and Pythagorean dreams.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Is not Naevius in our hands, and clinging to our minds, almost as of yesterday?[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] So holy a thing is every ancient poem. As often as the question is raised, which is the better of the two, Pacuvius gains fame as the learned old writer, Accius as the lofty one. The gown[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] of Afranius, ’tis said, was of Menander’s fit; Plautus hurries along[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] like his model, Epicharmus of Sicily.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Horace makes use of the logical puzzle known as [c dimgray]sorites[/c] (σωρός, a heap). How many grains of sand make a heap or pile? The addition of no one grain will make that a heap which was not a heap before. He also seems to have asked how many hairs make a tail. See Plutarch’s story of the two horses in his [c dimgray]Sertorius[/c].
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Horace is giving a summary of the conventional literary opinions of his day as to the old writers. Ennius is called [c dimgray]sapiens[/c] because of his philosophical poems, and [c dimgray]fortis[/c], because in his [c dimgray]Annales[/c] he recounted the [c dimgray]fortia facta patrum[/c]. As to [c dimgray]alter Homerus[/c], this exaggerated phrase was used of him by Lucilius (ed. Marx, frag. 1189).
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Ennius tells us that Homer, appearing to him in a dream, informed him that his soul now dwelt in Ennius’s  body. This doctrine of transmigration of souls was taught by Pythagoras.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]Naevius died in 199 b.c. He wrote both tragedies and comedies, as well as an epic, the [c dimgray]Bellum Punicum[/c] (this in Saturnian metre). Of the other writers named here, Pacuvius and Accius were tragic poets; the rest comic poets. For Livius see note [c dimgray]a[/c] overleaf.
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]Horace mentions the [c dimgray]toga[/c] of Afranius, because that writer’s plays were called [c dimgray]togatae[/c], being comedies based on Italic characters and customs, in contrast with the [c dimgray]palliatae[/c], which were Greek throughout.
	[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]The verb [c dimgray]properare[/c] implies rapidity of movement, which we are to associate with Epicharmus, the great writer of Sicilian comedy. This was “essentially burlesque” (Jevons, [c dimgray]Hist[/c]. [c dimgray]of Greek Lit[/c]. p. 240).

	mighty Rome learns by heart; these she views, when packed in her narrow theatre; these she counts as her muster-roll of poets from the days of Livius[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] the writer to our own.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]88[/c]At times the public see straight; sometimes they make mistakes. If they admire the ancient poets and cry them up so as to put nothing above them, nothing on their level, they are wrong. If they hold that sometimes their diction is too quaint, and ofttimes too harsh, if they admit that much of it is flat, then they have taste, they take my side, and give a verdict with Jove’s assent. Mark you! I am not crying down the poems of Livius—I would not doom to destruction verses which I remember Orbilius of the rod dictated to me as a boy: but that they should be held faultless, and beautiful, and well-nigh perfect, amazes me. Among them, it may be a pleasing phrase shines forth, or one or two lines are somewhat better turned—then these unfairly carry off and sell the whole poem.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]76[/c]I am impatient that any work is censured, not because it is thought to be coarse or inelegant in style, but because it is modern, and that what is claimed for the ancients should be, not indulgence, but honour and rewards. If I were to question whether a play of Atta’s keeps its legs[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] or not amidst the saffron and flowers,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] nearly all our elders would cry out that modesty is dead, when I attempt to blame what stately Aesopus and learned Roscius once acted; either because they think nothing can be right save what has pleased themselves, or
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Livius Andronicus, earliest of Latin writers, brought out two plays, a tragedy and a comedy, in 240 b.c. He died in 204 b.c.

	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The stage was perfumed with saffron-water. In [c dimgray]flores[/c] Porphyrio finds a reference to a play of Atta’s called [c dimgray]Matertera[/c], in which a great number of flowers were enumerated. Atta, a writer of [c dimgray]togatae[/c], died in 78 b.c. He was, therefore, not very ancient, though his fragments show many archaisms.

	because they hold it a shame to yield to their juniors, and to confess in their old age that what they learned in beardless youth should be destroyed. Indeed, whoever cries up Numa’s Salian hymn,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and would alone seem to understand what he knows as little of as I do, that man does not favour and applaud the genius of the dead, but assails ours to-day, spitefully hating us and everything of ours.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]90[/c]But if novelty had been as offensive to the Greeks as it is to us, what in these days would be ancient? What would the public have to read and thumb, each according to his taste?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]93[/c]From the day she dropped her wars,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Greece took to trifling, and amid fairer fortunes drifted into folly: she was all aglow with passion, now for athletes, now for horses; she raved over workers in marble or ivory or bronze; with eyes and soul she hung enraptured on the painted panel; her joy was now in flautists, and now in actors of tragedy. Like a baby-girl playing at its nurse s feet, what she wanted in impatience, she soon, when satisfied, cast off. What likes and dislikes are there that you would not think easily changed? Such was the effect of happy times of peace and prosperous gales.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]103[/c]At Rome it was long a pleasure and habit to be up at dawn with open doors, to set forth the law for clients, to pay out to sound debtors money under bonds, to give ear to one’s elders and to tell one’s juniors how an estate might be increased and ruinous
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The hymns of the Salii, a priesthood of Mars instituted by Numa, were almost unintelligible to the priests them–selves in the days of Quintilian; “Saliorum carmina vix sacerdotibus suis satis intellecta” (Quint, i. 6.40).
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Probably a reference to the Persian wars, which were wed by a wonderful literary and artistic epoch in Athens.

	indulgence curbed. The fickle public has changed its taste and is fired throughout with a scribbling craze; sons and grave sires sup crowned with leaves and dictate their lines.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] I myself, who declare that I write no verses, prove to be more of a liar than the Parthians: before sunrise I wake, and call for pen, paper, and writing-case. A man who knows nothing of a ship fears to handle one; no one dares to give southernwood to the sick unless he has learnt its use; doctors undertake a doctor’s work; carpenters handle carpenters’ tools: but, skilled or unskilled, we scribble poetry, all alike.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]118[/c]And yet this craze, this mild madness, has its merits. How great these are, now consider. Seldom is the poet’s heart set on gain: verses he loves; this is his one passion. Money losses, runaway slaves, fires—he laughs at all. To cheat partner or youthful ward he never plans. His food is pulse and coarse bread. Though a poor soldier, and slow in the field, he serves the State, if you grant that even by small things are great ends helped. The poet fashions the tender, lisping lips of child-hood; even then he turns the ear from unseemly words; presently, too, he moulds the heart by kindly precepts, correcting roughness and envy and anger. He tells of noble deeds, equips the rising age with famous examples, and to the helpless and sick at heart brings comfort. Whence, in company with chaste boys, would the unwedded maid learn the suppliant hymn, had the Muse not given them a bard? Their chorus asks for aid and feels the presence of the gods, calls for showers from heaven, winning favour with the prayer he has taught, averts disease, drives away dreaded dangers, gains peace

	[c dimgray]139[/c]The farmers[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] of old, a sturdy folk with simple wealth, when, after harvesting the grain, they sought relief at holiday time for the body, as well as for the soul, which bore its toils in hope of the end, together with slaves and faithful wife, partners of their labours, used to propitiate Earth with swine, Silvanus with milk, and with flowers and wine the Genius[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] who is ever mindful of the shortness of life. Through this custom came into use the Fescennine licence, which in alternate verse poured forth rustic taunts[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and the freedom, welcomed each returning year, was innocently gay, till jest, now growing cruel, turned to open frenzy, and stalked amid the homes of honest folk, fearless in its threatening. Stung to the quick were they who were bitten by a tooth that drew blood; even those untouched felt concern for the common cause, and at last a law[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] was carried with a penalty, forbidding the portrayal of any in abusive strain. Men changed their tune, and terror of the cudgel led them back to goodly and gracious forms of speech.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]In ll. 131-132, Horace is thinking chiefly of the chorus of boys and girls who sang the [c dimgray]Carmen Saeculare[/c] in 17 b.c.; in ll. 134-137, he sets forth the function of the chorus, especially in association with religious ceremonies.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]This account of the development of a Latin drama from a rustic origin may be compared with Virgil’s sketch of the rise of the drama in [c dimgray]Georg[/c]. ii. 385 ff., and with the outline given by Livy in Book vii. 2.

	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]These Fescennine verses, the earliest form of Italian drama, survived in later times in the abusive songs sung at weddings and in triumphal processions. They were so named either from the town of Fescennium in Etruria, or from the fact that a symbol of life ([c dimgray]fascinum[/c]) was often carried in procession in order to ward off the evil eye. Such a phallic symbol was in common use among the Greeks, and it is a well-known fact that the germ of Greek comedy is to be found in the phallic songs sung in the Dionysiac festivities.

	Thus the stream of that rude Saturnian measure[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] ran dry and good taste banished the offensive poison; yet for many a year lived on, and still live on, traces of our rustic past. For not till late did the Roman turn his wit to Greek writings, and in the peaceful days after the Punic wars he began to ask what service Sophocles could render, and Thespis and Aeschylus. He also made essay, whether he could reproduce[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] in worthy style, and took pride in his success, being gifted with spirit and vigour; for he has some tragic inspiration, and is happy in his ventures, but in ignorance, deeming it disgraceful, hesitates to blot.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]168[/c]’Tis thought that Comedy, drawing its themes from daily life, calls for less labour; but in truth it carries a heavier burden, as the indulgence allowed is less. See how Plautus plays the part of the youthful lover, how he plays that of the close father, or of the tricky pander; what a Dossennus[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] he is among his greedy parasites; with what a loose sock[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] he scours the scene. Yes, he is eager to drop a coin into his pocket and, that done, he cares not whether his play fall or stand square on its feet.[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]This ancient Italian metre, now generally believed to be based on accent instead of quantity, was used by Naevius in his epic on the Punic War, and is illustrated by numerous inscriptions. With the introduction of Greek literature into Rome, it gave way to the hexameter and other Greek metrical forms.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The word [c dimgray]vertere[/c] means not merely to “translate,” but rather to “transfer,” [c dimgray]i[/c].[c dimgray]e[/c]. from the Greek to the Roman stage.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c][c dimgray]i[/c].[c dimgray]e[/c]. as Pope says of Dryden, he lacks “the last and greatest art, the art to blot.”
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]Dossennus, the sly villain, was one of the stock characters in the Atellan farce of the Oscans. The [c dimgray]nomen[/c] of Plautus, viz. [c dimgray]Maccius[/c], is plausibly derived from another of these stock characters, [c dimgray]i[/c].[c dimgray]e[/c]. Maccus, the buffoon.
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]The [c dimgray]soccus[/c], or low slipper worn by the actors, represents Comedy, as the [c dimgray]cothurnus[/c], or high buskin, stands for Tragedy.
	[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]Horace, wedded to classical standards, could not appreciate Plautus fairly. Thus he here imputes to him a sordid motive for characteristics which were probably due to the influence of native forms of drama. See the translator’s edition of the [c dimgray]Andria[/c] of Terence (Introduction, p. xxviii).

	[c dimgray]182[/c]Often even the bold poet is frightened and put to rout, when those who are stronger in number, but weaker in worth and rank, unlearned and stupid and ready to fight it out if the knights dispute with them, call in the middle of a play for a bear or for boxers: ’tis in such things the rabble delights. But nowadays all the pleasure even of the knights has passed from the ear to the vain delights of the wandering[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] eye. For four hours or more the curtains are kept down,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] while troops of horse and files of foot sweep by: anon are dragged in kings, once fortune’s favourites, their hands bound behind them: with hurry and scurry come chariots, carriages, wains, and ships; and borne in triumph are spoils of ivory, spoils of Corinthian bronze. Were Democritus[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] still on earth, he would laugh; whether it were some hybrid monster—a panther crossed with a camel[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] —or a white elephant, that drew the eyes of the crowd—he would gaze more intently on the people than on the play itself, as giving him more by far worth looking at. But for the authors—he would suppose that they were telling their tale to a deaf ass.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] For what voices have ever prevailed to drown the din with which our theatres resound? One might think it was the roaring of the Garganian forest or of the

And lest, perchance, you may think that I begrudge praise when others are handling well what I decline to try myself, methinks that poet is able to walk a tight rope, who with airy nothings wrings my heart, inflames, soothes, fills it with vain alarms like a magician, and sets me down now at Thebes, now at Athens.

	’tis worth inquiring what manner of ministrants attend on Merit,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] tried at home and in the field, and never to be entrusted to an unworthy poet. Well-pleasing to the great king Alexander was that poor Choerilus, who could thank his uncouth and misbegotten verses for the philips[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—good royal coin—that he received; but as ink when handled leaves mark and stain, so ofttimes with unseemly verse poets put a blot on bright exploits. That same king who lavishly paid so dearly for a poem so foolish, by an edict forbade anyone save Apelles to paint him, or any other than Lysippus to model bronze in copying the features of brave Alexander. But call that judgement, so nice for viewing works of art, to books and to these gifts of the Muses, and you’d swear that he’d been born in Boeotia’s heavy air.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But Virgil and Varius, those poets whom you love, discredit not your judgement of them nor the gifts which, to the giver’s great renown, they have received; and features are seen with no more truth, when moulded in statues of bronze, than are the manners and minds of famous heroes, when set forth in the poet’s work. And for myself, I should not prefer my “chats,” that crawl along the ground[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] to the story of great exploits, the tale of distant lands and rivers, of forts on mountain tops, of barbaric realms, of the ending of wars under your auspices throughout the world, of bars that close on Janus,

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c][c dimgray]Virtus[/c], the sum total of a great man’s merits, is here personified, and poets are spoken of as the priests in her temple.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The [c dimgray]Philippi[/c] were gold coins which bore the image of Philip of Macedon, and circulated freely throughout the Greek world. Choerilus was an epic poet of Iasos in Caria, mentioned again in [c dimgray]Ars Poetica[/c], 357.

Nay, zeal is foolish to worry those it loves, above all when it commends itself by numbers and by art; for men more quickly learn and more gladly recall what, they deride than what they approve and esteem. Not for me attentions that are burdensome, and I want neither to be displayed anywhere in wax,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] with my features misshaped, nor to be praised in verses ill-wrought, lest I have to blush at the stupid gift, and then, along with my poet, outstretched in a closed chest, be carried into the street where they sell frankincense and perfumes and pepper and everything else that is wrapped in sheets of useless paper.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	If one were to offer a slave for sale, and declare his defects, the purchaser would have no right to complain of these later. So you, Floras, must not grumble at my not writing to you, for I warned you before you started that I never answer letters. And then, over and above this, you complain of my breaking my word, when you receive from me no poems (1-25).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Let me remind you of the story of a certain soldier of Lucullus. One night he had all his savings stolen. Upon this he rushed off furiously to storm a castle, and won thereby both glory and a rich reward. But later, when his general invited him to repeat the exploit, he declined, and advised the officer to send somebody who had lost his purse. I am like that soldier. I lost everything at Philippi, and took to poetry to make a living, but now that I have a competence I should be mad if I did not prefer ease to writing (26-54).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But there are other reasons why I do not write. Time is stealing from me my poetical power, as it has already taken from me my youth. After all, too, tastes vary, and while you are asking for Odes, others call for Epodes or Satires. Besides, how can

	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles II[/b][/c]
	you expect a man to write amid all the distractions of Rome? The poet must live in seclusion, and then he becomes quite unfit for active life. If this is true of Athens, how much more so is it of noisy Rome? How then can I deign to write poetry here? (55-86).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“Deign,” did I say? Why, the only way to win success here as a poet is to join some mutual admiration club, and for my part I am no longer suing for favour—I am no longer writing, and I can decline to listen to the recitations of others (87-105).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Poor poets, however much derided, are well satisfied with themselves. But the writing of good poetry is a very serious matter, and demands a fine taste and careful discrimination in the choice of language. The result will seem easy, but that ease is the product of much labour. Perhaps it is better to be one of those self-complacent writers than to be ever finding fault with oneself. The man at Argos learned what a misfortune it is to be robbed of one’s illusions (106-140).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The truth is, it is time for a man of my years to throw aside mere toys like poetry and take up the serious business of life, that of philosophy. So, beginning with the elements, I repeat to myself the wise precepts that I have picked up. Avarice, for example, is as much a disease as dropsy. For the latter you consult a doctor, and when the course prescribed brings no relief, you change the treatment or the doctor. Should not avarice be dealt with in like manner? (141-154).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If wealth could make you wise, you ought to devote yourself wholly to it. And yet what comes from all this struggle to make money? Ownership brings no more satisfaction than the right to use and enjoy,
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 422[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Epistles II[/b][/c]
	and even the law recognizes the fact that this [c dimgray]usucapio[/c] is the same in the end as [c dimgray]dominium[/c] or ownership. As a matter of fact, there is no such thing as out and out ownership, or ownership in perpetuity, for Death prevents that (155-179).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In any case, wealth takes many forms, and some care nothing for what others value so highly. Why this is so, I cannot say, but for my part I hold that life’s pleasures are to be enjoyed in moderation. Let me but be free from squalor, and I shall be just as happy sailing on life’s sea in a small as in a large ship (180-204).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But avarice is not the only evil that may assail the heart, and the wise man will free himself from all disturbing passions and fears. If one cannot live well, he should give way to those who can. When a man has had his share in the banquet of life, it is time to withdraw (205-216).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Florus of this Epistle is the Julius Florus to whom [c dimgray]Epist[/c]. i. 3 is also addressed. He is still in the suite of Tiberius, and as there is a great similarity of tone between this Epistle and the first of the First Book, it is likely that it was written shortly after the publication of that book in 20 b.c. At any rate, in view of the writer’s renunciation of lyric poetry in this Epistle, it can hardly have been written in the years when the [c dimgray]Carmen Saeculare[/c] and the Fourth Book of [c dimgray]Odes[/c] came into being (17-13 b.c.).

	Epistle II
	My Florus, loyal friend of great and good Nero,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] suppose someone by chance should wish to sell you a slave, born at Tibur or Gabii,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and should deal with you thus: “Here’s a handsome boy, comely from top to toe; you may take him, to have and to hold, for eight thousand sesterces; home-bred he is, apt for service at his owner’s beck, knows a bit of Greek learning, and can master any art; the clay is soft—you will mould it to what you will; moreover, he will sing for you over your cups in a sweet if artless fashion. Too many promises lessen confidence, when a seller who wants to shove off his wares praises them unduly. I am under no constraint; I have slender means, but am not in debt. None of the slave-dealers would give you such a bargain; not everyone would easily get the like from me. Once he played truant, and hid himself, as boys will do, under the stairs, fearing the hanging strap.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Give me the sum asked, if his running off, duly noted, does not trouble you”: the seller, I take it, would get his price without fear of penalty.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] You bought him with your eyes open—fault and all; the condition was told you; do you still pursue

	[c dimgray]26[/c]A soldier of Lucullus,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] by dint of many toils, had laid by savings, but one night, when weary and slumbering, had lost all down to the last penny. After this, furious as a wolf, angry with himself and his foe alike, and fiercely showing hungry teeth, he dislodged, they say, a royal garrison from a strongly fortified site, rich in vast treasure. Winning fame thereby, he was decorated with gifts of honour, and received, over and above, twenty thousand sesterces in coin. Soon after this it chanced that the commander, wishing to storm some fort, began to urge the man with words that might have given spirit even to a coward: “Go, sir, whither your valour calls you. Go, good luck to you!—to win big rewards for your merits. Why stand still?” On this the shrewd fellow, rustic though he was, replied: “Yes, he will go—go where you wish—he who has lost his wallet.”

Soon as Philippi gave me discharge[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] therefrom, brought low with wings clipped and beggared of paternal home and estate, barefaced poverty drove me to writing verses. But now that I have sufficient store, what doses of hemlock could ever suffice to cleanse my blood, if I were not to think it better to slumber[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] than to scribble verses?

	[c dimgray]55[/c]The years, as they pass, plunder us of all joys, one by one. They have stripped me of mirth, love, feasting, play; they are striving to wrest from me my poems.

Would you wish me, amid noises by night and noises by day, to sing and pursue the minstrels’ narrow pathway? A gifted man, that has chosen for home sequestered Athens, that has given seven years to his studies and grown grey over his books and meditations, when he walks abroad is often more mute than a statue and makes the people shake with laughter: and [c dimgray]here[/c],[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] amid the waves of life, amid the tempests of the town, am I to deign[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] to weave together words which shall awake the music of the lyre?

	you have time, follow, and draw close to hear what each has to offer, and with what he weaves for himself a chaplet. We belabour each other, and with tit for tat use up our foe, like Samnites, in a long-drawn bout, till the first lamps are lighted.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] By his vote I come off an Alcaeus. What is he by mine? What, but a Callimachus! If he seems to claim more, he becomes a Mimnermus, and is glorified with the title of his choice.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Much do I endure, to soothe the fretful tribe of bards, so long as I am scribbling, and humbly suing for public favour; but now that my studies are ended and my wits recovered, I would, without fear of requital, stop up my open ears when they recite.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]106[/c]Those who write poor verses are a jest; yet they rejoice in the writing and revere themselves; and, should you say nothing, they themselves praise whatever they have produced—happy souls! But the man whose aim is to have wrought a poem true to Art’s rules, when he takes his tablets, will take also the spirit of an honest censor.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] He will have the courage, if words fall short in dignity, lack weight, or be deemed unworthy of rank, to remove them from their place, albeit they are loth to withdraw, and still linger within Vesta’s precincts.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] Terms long
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The two poets, indulging in mutual compliments, and inflicting their compositions on each other, are humorously compared to a pair of those heavy-armed gladiators known as Samnites, who would engage in a wearisome, though harmless fight, till night put an end to the contest.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]It is commonly supposed that in this whole scene the second poet referred to by Horace is Propertius, the elegiac writer ([c dimgray]cf[/c]. 1.91) who called himself “the Roman Callimachus.” Callimachus, an Alexandrian poet of the third cent. b.c., was commonly held to be the greatest of Greek elegists. For Mimnermus [c dimgray]cf[/c]. [c dimgray]Epist[/c]. i. 6.65. He lived in the latter half of the seventh cent. b.c., and was the first to make elegy a vehicle for love-sentiment.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Horace means that if he does not write, he need not listen. Others prefer to connect [c dimgray]impune[/c] with [c dimgray]legentibus[/c]. The others recite without fear of his retaliating.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]These lines were used by Dr. Johnson as the motto for his Dictionary.
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]The allusion is obscure. Vesta perhaps stands for the most sacred traditions of Rome, so that the words rejected by the poet still remain in common use. Keller thinks that Horace uses a quotation from Ennius or some other early poet.

	lost in darkness the good poet will unearth for the people’s use and bring into the light—picturesque terms which, though once spoken by a Cato and a Cethegus of old.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] now lie low through unseemly neglect and dreary age. New ones he will adopt which Use has fathered and brought forth.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Strong and clear, and truly like a crystal river, he will pour forth wealth and bless Latium with richness of speech; he will prune down rankness of growth, smooth with wholesome refinement what is rough, sweep away what lacks force—wear the look of being at play, and yet be on the rack, like a dancer who plays now a Satyr, and now a clownish Cyclops.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray]126[/c]I should prefer to be thought a foolish and clumsy scribbler, if only my failings please, or at least escape me, rather than be wise and unhappy[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Once at Argos there was a man of some rank, who used to fancy that he was listening to wonderful tragic actors, while he sat happy and applauded in the empty theatre—a man who would correctly perform all other duties of life, a most worthy neighbour, an amiable host, kind to his wife, one that could excuse his slaves, and not get frantic if the seal of a flask were broken, one that could avoid a precipice or an open well. This man was cured by his kinsmen’s help and care, but when with strong hellebore he had driven out the malady and its bile, and had come to himself again, he cried: “Egad! you have killed me, my friends, not saved me; for thus you have robbed me of a pleasure and taken away perforce the dearest illusion of my heart.”

	[c dimgray]141[/c]In truth it is profitable to cast aside toys and to learn wisdom; to leave to lads the sport that fits their age, and not to search out words that will fit the music of the Latin lyre, but to master the rhythms and measures of a genuine life. There-fore I talk thus to myself and silently recall these precepts:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If no amount of water could quench your thirst, you would tell your story to the doctor: seeing that the more you get, the more you want, do you not dare to make confession to any man? If your wound were not relieved by the root or herb prescribed, you would give up being treated with the root or herb that did you no good: you had perhaps been told that perverse folly flees from him to whom the gods had given wealth; but though you are no wiser since you became richer, do you still follow the same counsellors?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]155[/c]But surely if wealth could make you wise, if less wedded to desires and fears, you would blush if there lived upon earth a greater miser than you. If that is a man’s own which he buys with bronze and balance,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] there are some things, if you trust the lawyers, which use[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] conveys; the farm which gives you food is yours, and the bailiff of Orbius, when he harrows the corn-land which is shortly to give you grain, feels you to be his master. You give your coin; you receive grapes, poultry, eggs, a jar of wine: in that way, mark you! you are buying bit by bit the farm once purchased for three hundred thousand sesterces, or perhaps even more. What does it matter, whether you live on what was paid out lately or

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]A reference to the common mode of conveying ownership in property, viz. by a symbolic sale, in which a balance, held by a third party, was struck by the purchaser with a copper coin.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c][c dimgray]Usucapio[/c], legal possession, uninterrupted and continued for a certain time, resulted in ownership ([c dimgray]dominium[/c]). But perhaps Horace jocularly refers to matrimony, where in certain cases [c dimgray]manus[/c] might result from [c dimgray]usus[/c]. So Polluck, [c dimgray]C[/c].[c dimgray]R[/c]. xxxi.

The man who once bought a farm at Aricia or Veii bought the greens for his dinner, though he thinks otherwise; he bought the logs with which he boils the kettle in the chill of nightfall.

	[c darkmagenta][b]HORACE, Ars Poetica[/b][/c]

	[c darkmagenta][b]Ars Poetica[/b][/c]
	[b]ARS POETICAor EPISTLE TO THE PISOS[/b]
	This, the longest of Horace’s poems, is found in nearly all mss. under the title [c dimgray]Ars Poetica,[/c] which is also the name assigned to it by Quintilian and used by the commentator Porphyrio. Yet the composition is a letter rather than a formal treatise, and it is hard to believe that Horace himself is responsible for the conventional title. It has the discursive and occasionally personal tone of an Epistle, whereas it lacks the completeness, precision, and logical order of a well-constructed treatise. It must therefore be judged by the same standards as the other [c dimgray]Epistles[/c] and [c dimgray]Sermones,[/c] and must be regarded as an expression of more or less random reflections, suggested by special circumstances, upon an art which peculiarly concerned one or more of the persons addressed. These are a father and two sons of the Piso family, but nobody knows with certainty what particular Pisos—and there are many on record—they are.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Though the writer touches upon various kinds of poetry, yet as fully one-third of the whole poem is concerned with the drama, it is a plausible inference that one at least of the Pisos — presumably the elder son (1. 366)—was about to write a play, perhaps one with an Homeric background (11. 128, 129), and
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 442[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Ars Poetica[/b][/c]
	possibly one conforming to the rules of the Greek satyric drama (11. 220 ff.). Thus the special interests of the Pisos may have determined Horace’s choice of topics.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The following is a brief outline of the main subjects handled in the letter:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	([c dimgray]a[/c]) A poem demands unity, to be secured by harmony and proportion, as well as a wise choice of subject and good diction. Metre and style must be appropriate to theme and to character. A good model will always be found in Homer (11. 1-152).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	([c dimgray]b[/c]) Dramatic poetry calls for special care—as to character drawing, propriety of representation, length of a play, number of actors, use of the chorus and its music, special features for the satyric type, verseforms, and employment of Greek models (11. 153-294).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	([c dimgray]c[/c]) A poet’s qualifications include common sense, knowledge of character, adherence to high ideals, combination of the [c dimgray]dulce[/c] with the [c dimgray]utile,[/c] intellectual superiority, appreciation of the noble history and lofty mission of poetry, and above all a willingness to listen to and profit by impartial criticism (11. 295-476).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The following is a more detailed analysis:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In poetry as in painting there must be unity and simplicity (1-23). We poets must guard against extremes, and while avoiding one error must not fall into its opposite (24-31). A good sculptor pays careful attention to details, but at the same time makes sure that his work as a whole is successful (32-37).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A writer should confine himself to subjects within his power. He will then be at no loss for words and will follow a correct order, which will enable him to

	[c darkmagenta][b]Ars Poetica[/b][/c]
	say the right thing at the right moment (38-45). As to diction, he must be careful in his choice of language. He can, by means of a skilful combination, give a fresh tone to familiar terms, and he may even coin words in moderation as the old poets used to do. Like all other mortal things, words change and pass out of existence, for they are subject to the caprice of fashion (46-72).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The metres most fitting for the several types of verse were established by the great Greek poets, and we must follow them (73-85). So with the tone and style of the various kinds. In the drama, for example, the tragic and the comic are distinct, though occasionally they will overlap (86-98), for above all things a play must appeal to the feelings of an audience, and the language must be adapted to the characters impersonated. Where there is lack of such agreement, everybody will laugh in scorn (99-118).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Either follow tradition or invent a consistent story. Achilles, Medea, Orestes, and so on must be portrayed as they are known to us in Greek literature, while new characters must be handled with a consistency of their own (119-127). It is hard to deal with general notions, such as anger, greed, and cowardice, so as to individualize them for yourself and you, my friend Piso, are quite right to dramatize some Homeric theme, where the characters introduced have well-known traits, rather than attempt something distinctly original. And yet, even in such public property as the Homeric epics you may win private rights by handling your material in an original fashion. Make a simple beginning, like that of the [c dimgray]Odyssey,[/c] where the sequel becomes clearer and
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 444[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Ars Poetica[/b][/c]
	increases in brilliancy. Homer indulges in no lengthy introduction, but hurries on with his narrative, omits what he cannot adorn, and never loses the thread of his story (128-152).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If you want your play to succeed, you must study the “ strange, eventful history ” of human life, and note the characteristics of the several ages of man, so that the different periods may not be confused (153-178). Events may be set forth in action or, less preferably, in narrative. The latter method, however, must be used in the case of revolting and incredible incidents (179-188).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A play should be in five acts. The [c dimgray]deus ex machina[/c] should be employed only rarely, and there should never be more than three characters on the stage at one time (189-192). The Chorus should take a real part in the action; it should not sing anything irrelevant, and should promote the cause of morality and religion (193-201). As to the music, the flute was once a simple instrument, which accompanied the chorus, and was not expected to fill large theatres as nowadays. With the growth of wealth and luxury in the state, and the consequent deterioration in the taste and character of the audience, the music became more florid and sensational, the diction more artificial, and the sentiments more obscure and oracular (202-219).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The satyric drama, with its chorus of goat-footed fauns, which was devised for spectators in their lighter moods, naturally assumed a gay and frolicsome tone as compared with the serious tragedy from which it sprang, but this does not warrant a writer in permitting his gods and heroes to use vulgar speech, or on the other hand in allowing them to

	[c darkmagenta][b]Ars Poetica[/b][/c]
	indulge in ranting. There should be a happy mean between the language of tragedy and that of comedy. I would aim at a familiar style, so that anyone might think it easy to write in that fashion, but on trying would find out his mistake. The rustic fauns must not talk like city wits, nor yet use such coarse language that they will give offence to the better part of an audience (220-250).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As to metre, the iambic is strictly a rapid measure, so that a senarius is counted as a trimeter. But the older poets admitted the spondee so freely, that it obscured the rhythm and made it heavy. In fact, it is not every critic that can detect unmusical verses, and too much freedom has been allowed our native poets. Shall I presume on this or shall I write with caution? If I follow the latter course, I may avoid criticism, but I shall not win praise. The proper course is to study Greek models night and day. He who is conversant with them will see that our fathers’ admiration for the rhythms, as well as the wit, of Plautus, was uncalled for (251-274).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Thespis, we are told, invented Tragedy, and Aeschylus perfected it. Old Attic Comedy, too, won no little renown until its licence had to be checked by law and its chorus was silenced (275-284). Our Roman poets, besides following the Greeks, were bold enough to invent forms of a national drama, and might have rivalled their masters, had they taken more pains. I beg you, my friends, to condemn every poem which has not been subjected to the finishing touch (285-294).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The idea that genius is allied to madness is carried so far that many would-be poets are slovenly in appearance and neglect their health. It is not worth
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 446[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Ars Poetica[/b][/c]
	while to compose poetry at the expense of your wits, [c dimgray]so,[/c] refraining from writing myself, I will teach the art to others, even as a whetstone can sharpen knives, though it cannot cut (295-308).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The first essential is wisdom. This you can cultivate by study of the philosophers, and when you have first learned from them valuable lessons of life, you should apply yourself to life itself, and then your personages will speak like real living beings. Sometimes striking passages and characters properly portrayed commend a mediocre play better than do verses which lack substance, mere trifles, however melodious (309-322).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Greeks had genius, eloquence, and ambition; the Romans are too practical, even in their elementary schooling. How can we expect a people thus trained to develop poets? Poetry aims at both instruction and pleasure. In your didactic passages, be not long-winded; in your fiction, avoid extravagance. Combine the [c dimgray]utile[/c] with the [c dimgray]dulce,[/c] for only thus will you produce a book that will sell, and enjoy a wide and lasting fame (323-346).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Absolute perfection, however, is not to be expected, and we must allow for slight defects. When I come across a good line in a poor poem, I am surprised and amused; I am merely grieved if Homer now and then nods (347-360). The critic must bear in mind that poetry is like painting. In each case the aim in view is to be considered. A miniature should bear close inspection; a wall-painting is to be seen from a distance. One thing which may be tolerated in other fields, but which in the sphere of poetry, whose aim is to give pleasure, is never allowed, is mediocrity. Like the athlete, therefore, the poet

	needs training—a truth overlooked by many. But you are too sensible to make a mistake here. You will write only when Minerva is auspicious, and what you write you will submit to a good critic. Even then you will be in no haste to publish (361-390).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Remember the glorious history of poetry, which— as the stories of Orpheus and Amphion show—has from the very infancy of the race promoted the cause of civilization. Then, from Homer on, it has inspired valour, has taught wisdom, has won the favour of princes, and has afforded relief after toil. Never need you be ashamed of the Muse (391-407).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The question has been asked whether it is natural ability or teaching that makes the poet. Both are necessary. However much people may boast of their gifts, ability without training will accomplish no more in writing than in running a race or in flute-playing (408-418).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is easy for a rich poet to buy applause. Flatterers are like hired mourners at a funeral, who feel no grief, however much they may weep. So be not deceived, but take a lesson from those kings, who, acting on the adage [c dimgray]in vino veritas,[/c] make men disclose the truth by plying them with wine (419-437).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Quintilius Varus was a frank and sincere critic, and if you would not take his advice he would leave you to your self-conceit. No honest man, for fear of giving offence, will conceal his friend’s faults from him, for those faults may lead to serious consequences (438-452).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And think of the danger of a crazy poet roaming at large. First, there is danger for himself, for if, as he goes about with upturned gaze, he fall into a ditch, nobody will pull him out. Indeed, he may
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 448[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Ars Poetica[/b][/c]
	have gone in on purpose, like Empedocles, who, thinking himself divine, once leaped into burning Aetna. And secondly, there is danger for others, for if he is so stark, staring mad as to be ever making verses, he will become a public scourge, and if he catches some poor wretch he will fasten on him like a leech, and make him listen to his recitations until he has bored him to death (453-476) !
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The sketch of a crazy poet with which the poem closes corresponds to that of the crazy painter with which it opens. Both painter and poet are used to impress upon readers the lesson that in poetry as in other arts the main principle to be followed is propriety. This idea of literary propriety, which runs through the whole epistle, is illustrated in many ways, and may be said to give the [c dimgray]Ars Poetica[/c] an artistic unity. (So Roy Kenneth Hack, “ The Doctrine of Literary Forms ” in [c dimgray]Harvard Studies in Classical Philology,[/c] vol. xxvii., 1916.)

	The Art of Poetry
	If a painter chose to join a human head to the neck of a horse, and to spread feathers of many a hue over limbs picked up now here now there, so that what at the top is a lovely woman ends below in a black and ugly fish, could you, my friends, if favoured with a private view, refrain from laughing? Believe me, dear Pisos, quite like such pictures would be a book, whose idle fancies shall be shaped like a sick man’s dreams, so that neither head nor foot can be assigned to a single shape. “Painters and poets,” you say, “have always had an equal right in hazarding anything.” We know it: this licence we poets claim and in our tum we grant the like; but not so far that savage should mate with tame, or serpents couple with birds, lambs with tigers.

	[c dimgray][sup]46[/sup][/c]Moreover, with a nice taste and care in weaving words together, you will express yourself most happily, if a skilful setting makes a familiar word new. If haply one must betoken abstruse things by novel terms, you will have a chance to fashion words never heard of by the kilted[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Cethegi, and licence will be granted, if used with modesty; while, words, though new and of recent make, will win acceptance, if they spring from a Greek fount and are drawn therefrom but sparingly.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Why indeed shall Romans grant this licence to Caecilius and Plautus, and refuse it to Virgil and Varius? And why should I be grudged the right of adding, if I can, my little fund, when the tongue of Cato and of Ennius has enriched our mother-speech and brought to light new terms for things? It has ever been, and ever will be, permitted to issue words stamped with the mint-mark of the day. As forests change their leaves with each year’s decline, and the earliest drop [c dimgray]off[/c][c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]: so with words the old race dies, and, like the young of human kind, the new-born bloom and thrive. We are doomed to death—we and all things ours; whether Neptune, welcomed within the land, protects our fleets from northern gales—a truly royal work—or a marsh, long a waste where oars

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Horace finds three illustrations of human achievement in certain engineering works planned by Julius Caesar or Augustus. These were: (1) the building of the Julian Harbour on the Campanian coast, where, under Agrippa, Lakes Avernus and Lucrinus were connected by a deep channel, and the sandy strip between the Lucrine Lake and the sea was pierced so as to admit ships from the Tuscan Sea; [c dimgray]cf[/c]. Virgil, [c dimgray]Georgics[/c], ii. 161 ff.; (2) the draining of the Pomptine marshes, planned by Julius Caesar and perhaps executed by Augustus; (3) the straightening of the Tiber’s course so as to protect Rome from floods.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c][c dimgray]Cf[/c]. [c dimgray]Epistles[/c] ii. 2. 119.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The dactylic hexameter.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]The elegiac couplet, made up of a hexameter and a pentameter (hence [c dimgray]impariter iunctis[/c]), was commonly used in inscriptions associated with votive offerings and expressed in the form of epigrams. The earliest elegiacs, however, were probably laments, such as those written by Archilochus on the loss of friends at sea.
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]The iambic trimeter was the measure used in dialogue, both in comedies and tragedies. For Archilochus see [c dimgray]Epist[/c]. i. 19. 23 ff.
	[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]Greek lyric poetry embraced hymns to the gods and heroes, odes commemorating victories in the games, love poems, and drinking-songs. For Pindaric themes [c dimgray]cf. Odes[/c], iv. 2. 10-24.
	[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c]From here on Horace deals especially with dramatic poetry. Tone and style, diction and metre should all accord.

	why am I hailed as poet? Why through false shame do I prefer to be ignorant rather than to learn? A theme for Comedy refuses to be set forth in verses of Tragedy; likewise the feast of Thyestes scorns to be told in strains of daily life that well nigh befit the comic sock. Let each style keep the becoming place allotted it. Yet at times even Comedy raises her voice, and an angry Chremes storms in swelling tones; so, too, in Tragedy Telephus and Peleus often grieve in the language of prose, when, in poverty and exile, either hero throws aside his bombast[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and Brobdingnagian[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] words, should he want his lament to touch the spectator’s heart.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]99[/sup][/c]Not enough is it for poems to have beauty: they must have charm, and lead the hearer’s soul where they will.” As men’s faces smile on those who smile, so they respond to those who weep. If you would have me weep, you must first feel grief yourself: then, O Telephus or Peleus, will your misfortunes hurt me: if the words you utter are ill suited, I shall laugh or fall asleep. Sad tones befit the face of sorrow; blustering accents that of anger; jests become the merry, solemn words the grave. For Nature first shapes us within to meet every change of fortune: she brings joy or impels to anger, or bows us to the ground and tortures us under a load of grief; then, with the tongue for interpreter, she proclaims the emotions of the soul. If the speaker’s words sound discordant with his fortunes, the Romans, in boxes and pit alike, will raise a loud guffaw. Vast difference will it make, whether a god be speaking or a hero, a ripe old man or one still in

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The Assyrian would be effeminate, as compared with the Colchian, but both would be barbarians. The Theban Creon is a headstrong tyrant, while the Argive Agamemnon shows reserve and dignity.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]In the [c dimgray]Iliad[/c] Achilles was first scorned by Agamemnon but in the sequel (Book IX, the embassy) highly honoured. Bentley conjectured that [c dimgray]honoratum[/c] was a corruption of [c dimgray]Homereum[/c], “the Achilles of Homer,” but we are dealing with a not uncommon use of the participle. So Elmore in [c dimgray]C[/c].[c dimgray]R[/c]. xxxiii. (1919) p. 102; [c dimgray]cf[/c]. [c dimgray]Sat[/c]. i. 6. 126.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]By [c dimgray]publica materies[/c] Horace means Homer and the epic field in general. A poet may make this his own by originality in the handling. Commentators are divided as to whether [c dimgray]communia[/c] (1. 128) is identical with [c dimgray]publica materies[/c] or not. The language is in the domain of law and as [c dimgray]res communes[/c], things common to all mankind, as the air and sea, differ from [c dimgray]res publicae[/c], things which belong to all citizens of a state, as its roads and theatres, so here [c dimgray]communia[/c] covers a larger field than [c dimgray]publica[/c], and denotes characteristics which are common among mankind. These may be compared to the general truths (τὰ καθόλου) of Aristotle ([c dimgray]Poet[/c], ix.), as distinguished from particular ones (ἕκαστον). In Horace it is obvious that [c dimgray]communia[/c] does not apply to [c dimgray]lliacum carmen[/c], which does, however, come under the [c dimgray]publica materies[/c] of the poet.

	into a passion and as lightly puts it aside, and changes every hour. The beardless youth, freed at last from his tutor, finds joy in horses and hounds and the grass of the sunny Campus,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] soft as wax for moulding to evil, peevish with his counsellors, slow to make needful provision, lavish of money, spirited, of strong desires, but swift to change his fancies. With altered aims, the age and spirit of the man seeks wealth and friends, becomes a slave to ambition, and is fearful of having done what soon it will be eager to change. Many ills encompass an old man, whether because he seeks gain, and then miserably holds aloof from his store and fears to use it, or because, in all that he does, he lacks fire and courage, is dilatory and slow to form hopes,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] is sluggish and greedy of a longer life, peevish, surly, given to praising the days he spent as a boy, and to reproving and condemning the young. Many blessings do the advancing years bring with them; many, as they retire, they take away. So, lest haply we assign a youth the part of age, or a boy that of manhood, we shall ever linger over traits that are joined and fitted to the age.

It is, however, in view of Horace’s [c dimgray]spes longa[/c] ([c dimgray]Odes[/c], i. 4. 15; i. 11. 6) taken by some as “far-reaching in hope,” the hope requiring a long time for fulfilment. Wickham suggests “patient in hope,” but the quality is here one of the [c dimgray]incommoda[/c] of age, not one of its blessings. The phrase is explanatory of [c dimgray]dilator[/c], even as [c dimgray]avidus futuri[/c] explains [c dimgray]iners[/c], for unlike the youth, who is absorbed in the present, the old man fails to act promptly, because his heart is in the future, however brief that is to be.

	could you expect of an unlettered throng just freed from toil, rustic mixed up with city folk, vulgar with nobly-born? So to the early art the flute-player added movement and display, and, strutting o’er the stage, trailed a robe in train. So, too, to the sober lyre new tones were given, and an impetuous style brought in an unwonted diction; and the thought, full of wise saws and prophetic of the future, was attuned to the oracles of Delphi.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

But it will be fitting so to seek favour for your laughing, bantering Satyrs, so to pass from grave to gay, that no god, no hero, who shall be brought upon the stage, and whom we have just beheld in royal gold and purple, shall shift with vulgar speech into dingy hovels, or, while shunning the ground, catch at clouds and emptiness. Tragedy, scorning to babble trivial verses, will, like a matron bidden to dance on festal days, take her place in the saucy Satyrs’ circle with some little shame.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Horace seems to speak flippantly of the style of choruses in Greek tragedy. He assumes that as the music became more florid, both speech and thought also lost their simplicity, the former becoming dithyrambic, the latter oracular and obscure. It is probable, however, that he has in view the post-classical drama.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Tragedy or “goat-song” was supposed to take its name from the prize of a goat. It was so called, however, because the singers were satyrs, dressed in goat-skins. Satyric drama, the subject of this passage, is closely connected with tragedy, and must not be handled as comedy. It came as a fourth play after a tragic trilogy. Horace treats this form as if it had developed out of tragedy, whereas in fact tragedy is an offshoot from it (see [c dimgray]e.g[/c]. Barnett, [c dimgray]The Greek Drama[/c], p. 11). As for a Satyric drama in Latin, little is known about it, but Pomponius, according to Porphyrio on 1. 221, wrote three [c dimgray]Satyrica[/c], viz. [c dimgray]Atalanta, Sisyphus[/c], and [c dimgray]Ariadne[/c].

In the “noble”[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] trimeters of Accius this [c dimgray]iambus[/c] appears but seldom; and on the verses which Ennius hurled ponderously upon the stage it lays the shameful charge either of hasty and too careless work or of ignorance of the art. Not every critic discerns unmusical verses, and so undeserved indulgence has been granted our Roman poets. Am I therefore to run loose and write without restraint? Or, supposing that all will see my faults, shall I seek safety and take care to keep within hope of pardon? At the best I have escaped censure, I have earned no praise. For yourselves, handle Greek models by night, handle them by day. Yet your forefathers, you say, praised both the measures and the wit of Plautus.

	[c dimgray][sup]285[/sup][/c]Our own poets have left no style untried, nor has least honour been earned when they have dared to leave the footsteps of the Greeks and sing of deeds at home, whether they have put native tragedies or native comedies upon the stage.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Nor would Latium be more supreme in valour and glory of arms than in letters, were it not that her poets, one and all, cannot brook the toil and tedium of the file.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]309[/sup][/c]Of good writing the source and fount is wisdom. Your matter the Socratic pages can set forth, and when matter is in hand words will not be loath to follow. He who has learned what he owes his country and his friends, what love is due a parent, a brother, and a guest, what is imposed on senator and judge, what is the function of a general sent to war, he surely knows how to give each character his fitting part. I would advise one who has learned the imitative art to look to life and manners for a model, and draw from thence living words.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] At times a play marked by attractive passages[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and characters fitly sketched, though lacking in charm, though without force and art, gives the people more delight and holds them better than verses void of thought, and sonorous trifles.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]323[/sup][/c]To the Greeks the Muse gave native wit, to the Greeks she gave speech in well-rounded phrase[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]; they craved naught but glory. Our Romans, by many a long sum, learn in childhood to divide the [c dimgray]as[/c] into a hundred parts. “Let the son of Albinus answer.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] If from five-twelfths one ounce be taken, what remains? You might have told me by now.” “A third.” “Good! you will be able to look after your means. An ounce is added; what’s the result?” “A half.” When once this canker, this lust of petty
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]I take [c dimgray]doctum[/c] as a repetition of [c dimgray]qui didicit[/c] (1.312). The drama is an imitation of life, and the would-be dramatist who has first learned about life from his studies should next tum to real life and make his own observations.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Some take [c dimgray]locis[/c] as equivalent to [c dimgray]sententiis[/c], moral reflections or commonplaces, which may be used anywhere.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c][c dimgray]Ore rotundo[/c] is here used of style, not utterance.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]This is a school-lesson in arithmetic. The Romans used a duodecimal system (their [c dimgray]as[/c] being divided into twelve ounces), and the children learn to reduce figures to decimals ([c dimgray]in partes centum[/c]).

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]333[/sup][/c]Poets aim either to benefit, or to amuse, or to utter words at once both pleasing and helpful to life. Whenever you instruct, be brief, so that what is quickly said the mind may readily grasp and faithfully hold: every word in excess flows away from the full mind. Fictions meant to please should be close to the real, so that your play must not ask for belief in anything it chooses, nor from the Ogress’s[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] belly, after dinner, draw forth a living child. The centuries of the elders chase from the stage what is profitless; the proud Ramnes disdain poems[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] devoid of charms. He has won every vote who has blended profit and pleasure, at once delighting and instructing the reader. That is the book to make money for the Sosii[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]; this the one to cross the sea and extend to a distant day its author’s fame.

	[c dimgray][sup]347[/sup][/c]Yet faults there are which we can gladly pardon; for the string does not always yield the sound which hand and heart intend, but when you call for a flat often returns you a sharp; nor will the bow always hit whatever mark it threatens, But when the beauties in a poem are more in number, I shall not take offence at a few blots which a careless hand has let drop, or human frailty has failed to avert. What, then, is the truth? As a copying clerk is without excuse if, however much warned, he always makes the same mistake, and a harper is laughed at who always blunders on the same string:

	so the poet who often defaults, becomes, methinks, another Choerilus, whose one or two good lines cause laughter and surprise; and yet I also feel aggrieved, whenever good Homer “nods,”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but when a work is long, a drowsy mood may well creep over it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]361[/sup][/c]A poem is like a picture: one strikes your fancy more, the nearer you stand; another, the farther away. This courts the shade, that will wish to be seen in the light, and dreads not the critic insight of the judge. This pleased but once; that, though ten times called for, will always please.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]366[/sup][/c]O you elder youth, though wise yourself and trained to right judgement by a father’s voice, take to heart and remember this saying, that only some things rightly brook the medium and the bearable. A lawyer and pleader of middling rank falls short of the merit of eloquent Messalla, and knows not as much as Aulus Cascellius, yet he has a value. But that poets be of middling rank, neither men nor gods nor booksellers ever brooked. As at pleasant banquets an orchestra out of tune, an unguent that is thick, and poppy-seeds served with Sardinian honey,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] give offence, because the feast might have gone on without them: so a poem, whose birth and creation are for the soul’s delight, if in aught it falls short of the top, sinks to the bottom. He who cannot play a game, shuns the weapons of the Campus,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and, if unskilled in ball or quoit or hoop, remains aloof, lest the crowded circle break out in righteous laughter. Yet the man who knows not how dares to frame verses. Why not? He is free, even free-born, nay, is rated at the fortune of a knight, and stands clear from every blemish.

Yet if ever you do write anything, let it enter the ears of some critical Maecius,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and your father’s, and my own; then put your parchment in the closet and keep it back till the ninth year.

	[c dimgray][sup]391[/sup][/c]While men still roamed the woods, Orpheus, the holy prophet of the gods, made them shrink from bloodshed and brutal living; hence the fable, that he tamed tigers and ravening lions; hence too the fable that Amphion, builder of Thebes’s citadel, moved stones by the sound of his lyre, and led them whither he would by his supplicating spell. In days of yore, this was wisdom, to draw a line between public and private rights, between things sacred and things common, to check vagrant union, to give rules for wedded life, to build towns, and grave laws on tables of wood[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]; and so honour and fame fell to bards and their songs, as divine.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] After these Homer won his renown, and Tyrtaeus[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] with his verses fired manly hearts for battles of Mars. In song oracles were given, and the way of life was shown[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c]; the favour of kings was sought in Pierian strains,[c dimgray][sup]h[/sup][/c] and mirth was found to close toil’s long spell.[c dimgray][sup]i[/sup][/c] So you need not blush for the Muse skilled in the lyre, and for Apollo, god of song.

	[c dimgray][sup]408[/sup][/c]Often it is asked whether a praiseworthy poem be due to Nature or to art. For my part, I do not see of what avail is either study, when not enriched by Nature’s vein, or native wit, if untrained; so truly does each claim the other’s aid, and make with it a friendly league. He who in the race-course craves to reach the longed-for goal, has borne much and done much as a boy, has sweated and shivered, has kept aloof from wine and women. The flautist who plays at the Pythian games, has first learned his lessons and been in awe of a master. To-day ’tis enough to say: “I fashion wondrous poems: the devil take the hindmost![c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] ’Tis unseemly for me to be left behind, and to confess that I really do not know what I have never learned.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray][sup]419[/sup][/c]Like the crier, who gathers a crowd to the auction of his wares, so the poet bids flatterers flock to the call of gain, if he is rich in lands, and rich in moneys put out at interest. But if he be one who can fitly serve a dainty dinner, and be surety for a poor man of little credit, or can rescue one entangled in gloomy suits-at-law, I shall wonder if the happy fellow will be able to distinguish between a false and a true friend. And you, if you have given or mean to give a present to anyone, do not bring him, in the fulness of his joy, to hear verses you have written. For he will call out “Fine! good! perfect!” He will change colour over them; he will even distil the dew from his friendly eyes, he will dance and thump the ground with his foot. As hired mourners at a funeral say and do almost more than those who grieve at heart, so the man who mocks is more moved than the true admirer. Kings, we are told, ply with many a bumper and test with

	[c dimgray][sup]438[/sup][/c]If you ever read aught to Quintilius,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] he would say: “Pray correct this and this.” If, after two or three vain trials, you said you could not do better, he would bid you blot it out, and return the ill-shaped verses to the anvil. If you preferred defending your mistake to amending it, he would waste not a word more, would spend no fruitless toil, to prevent your loving yourself and your work alone without a rival. An honest and sensible man will censure lifeless lines, he will find fault with harsh ones; if they are graceless, he will draw his pen across and smear them with a black stroke; he will cut away pretentious ornament; he will force you to flood the obscure with light, will convict the doubtful phrase, will mark what should be changed, will prove an Aristarchus.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] He will not say, “Why should I give offence to a friend about trifles?” These trifles will bring that friend into serious trouble, if once he has been laughed down and given an unlucky reception.

	then if, like a fowler with his eyes upon blackbirds, he fall into a well[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] or pit, despite his far-reaching cry, “Help, O fellow-citizens!” not a soul will care to pull him out. And if one should care to lend aid and let down a rope, “How do you know,” I’ll say, “but that he threw himself in on purpose, and does not wish to be saved?” and I’ll tell the tale of the Sicilian poet’s end. Empedocles, eager to be thought a god immortal, coolly leapt into burning Aetna. Let poets have the right and power to destroy themselves. Who saves a man against his will does the same as murder him. Not for the first time has he done this, nor if he is pulled out will he at once become a human being and lay aside his craving for a notable death. Nor is it very clear how he comes to be a verse-monger. Has he defiled ancestral ashes or in sacrilege disturbed a hallowed plot[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]? At any rate he is mad, and, like a bear, if he has had strength to break the confining bars of his cage, he puts learned and unlearned alike to flight by the scourge of his recitals. If he catches a man, he holds him fast and reads him to death—a leech that will not let go the skin, till gorged with blood.
