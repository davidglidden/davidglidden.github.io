	[b]To Demonicus[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The author of the Greek “hypothesis” to this discourse,
	preserved in two of the mss., mentions a
	tradition that Hipponicus, the father of Demonicus
	and friend of Isocrates, was a Cyprian.[c dimgray]a[/c] If this is
	true, then [c dimgray]To Demonicus[/c], like [c dimgray]To Nicocles, Nicocles
	or the Cyprians[/c], and [c dimgray]Evagoras[/c], is a result of Isocrates’
	associations with the island of Cyprus, and may be
	grouped with his “Cyprian” orations. In any case
	it seems to belong to the same period as the discourses
	written for Nicocles, the young Cyprian king:
	374–372 b.c.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The “hypothesis” dates, however, from the fourth
	century a.d., and its authority is, therefore, open to
	question; all that we know with certainty is what we
	can infer from the discourse itself: that Demonicus
	lived in a monarchy, that he was young, and that his
	father, Hipponicus, recently dead, was a man of note,
	of exemplary character, and a friend of Isocrates.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The [c dimgray]Address to Demonicus[/c] is classed with the two
	following discourses as a treatise on practical ethics,
	being made up of precepts on the proper conduct of
	life.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] These fall roughly into three main divisions:
	(1) man in his relation to the gods; (2) in his relation

	to men, including society in general, especially
	parents and friends; (3) in relation to himself—the
	harmonious development of his own character.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Yet the treatise lacks unity in that these precepts
	are rather loosely put together in the manner of the
	“gnomic” literature of the time, the body of the
	discourse being in fact a string of detached maxims[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	in which the author’s personal admonitions are
	mingled with maxims drawn from other sources,
	mainly from Theognis and the other gnomic poets,
	the sayings of the “Seven Sages,” and the homely
	preachings of Socrates.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But there is lacking not only unity of form but
	unity of spirit. Shrewd advice for getting on in this
	workaday world is imperfectly harmonized with an
	occasional note of exalted idealism—a discord which
	is characteristic of the “practical philosophy;” of
	Isocrates.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The authenticity of the discourse has been challenged,
	in modern times notably by Benseler, but
	on insufficient grounds.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]This looseness of composition is found also in [c dimgray]To Nicocles[/c],
	as Isocrates himself points out in [c dimgray]Antid.[/c] 68.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]In [c dimgray]To Nicocles[/c] Isocrates acknowledges that his material
	has been drawn from many sources. See 40, 41.

	[b]The Orations of Isocrates[/b]
	[b]I . to Demonicus[/b]
	In many respects, Demonicus, we shall find that
	much disparity exists between the principles of good
	men and the notions of the base; but most of all by
	far have they parted company in the quality of their
	friendships.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] The base honour their friends only
	when they are present; the good cherish theirs
	even when they are far away; and while it takes
	only a short time to break up the intimacies of the
	base, not all eternity can blot out the friendships
	of good men. So then, since I deem it fitting that
	those who strive for distinction and are ambitious for
	education should emulate the good and not the bad,
	I have dispatched to you this discourse as a gift, in
	proof of my good will toward you and in token of
	my friendship for Hipponicus; for it is fitting that
	a son should inherit his father’s friendships even as
	he inherits his estate. I see, moreover, that fortune
	is on our side and that the present circumstances are
	in league with us; for you are eager for education
	and I profess to educate; you are ripe for philosophy[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	and I direct students of philosophy.

	Now those who compose hortatory discourses
	addressed to their own friends are, no doubt, engaged
	in a laudable employment; yet they do not occupy
	themselves with the most vital part of philosophy.
	Those, on the contrary, who point out to the young,
	not by what means they may cultivate skill in
	oratory, but how they may win repute as men of
	sound character, are rendering a greater service[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] to
	their hearers in that, while the former exhort them
	to proficiency in speech, the latter improve their
	moral conduct.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Therefore, I have not invented a hortatory[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] exercise,
	but have written a moral treatise; and I am
	going to counsel you on the objects to which young
	men should aspire and from what actions they should
	abstain, and with what sort of men they should
	associate and how they should regulate their own
	lives. For only those who have travelled this road
	in life have been able in the true sense to attain to
	virtue—that possession which is the grandest and
	the most enduring in the world. For beauty is spent
	by time or withered by disease; wealth ministers to
	vice rather than to nobility of soul, affording means
	for indolent living and luring the young to pleasure;
	strength, in company with wisdom, is, indeed, an
	advantage, but without wisdom it harms more than
	it helps its possessors, and while it sets off the
	bodies of those who cultivate it, yet it obscures the
	care of the soul.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] But virtue, when it grows up with

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Hermogenes, Περὶ μεθόδου δεινότητος, 25, refers to this
	introduction as an example of inoffensive self-laudation in
	the orators.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]For Isocrates’ insistence on right conduct as the end of
	education see Introduction, p. xxv.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]This discourse is really hortatory in the general sense of
	that word, but Isocrates distinguishes it from hortatory
	(“protreptic”) discourses of the sophists, which were
	lectures to stimulate interest in whatever kind of learning
	they professed to teach, commonly oratory.

	us in our hearts without alloy, is the one possession
	which abides with us in old age; it is better than
	riches and more serviceable than high birth; it
	makes possible what is for others impossible; it
	supports with fortitude that which is fearful to the
	multitude; and it considers sloth a disgrace and toil
	an honour. This it is easy to learn from the labours
	of Heracles and the exploits of Theseus, whose
	excellence of character has impressed upon their

	Nay, if you will but recall also your father’s principles,
	you will have from your own house a noble
	illustration of what I am telling you. For he did
	not belittle virtue nor pass his life in indolence; on
	the contrary, he trained his body by toil, and by his
	spirit he withstood dangers. Nor did he love wealth
	inordinately; but, although he enjoyed the good
	things at his hand as became a mortal, yet he cared
	for his possessions as if he had been immortal.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	Neither did he order his existence sordidly, but was
	a lover of beauty, munificent in his manner of life,
	and generous to his friends; and he prized more
	those who were devoted to him than those who were
	his kin by blood; for he considered that in the matter
	of companionship nature is a much better guide than
	convention, character than kinship, and freedom of
	choice than compulsion.

	recount all his activities. On another occasion I
	shall set them forth in detail;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] for the present,
	however, I have produced a sample of the nature of
	Hipponicus, after whom you should pattern your life
	as after an ensample, regarding his conduct as your
	law, and striving to imitate and emulate your father’s
	virtue; for it were a shame, when painters represent
	the beautiful among animals, for children not to
	imitate the noble among their ancestors. Nay, you
	must consider that no athlete is so in duty bound to
	train against his competitors as are you to take
	thought how you may vie with your father in his
	ways of life. But it is not possible for the mind to
	be so disposed unless one is fraught with many noble
	maxims; for, as it is the nature of the body to be
	developed by appropriate exercises, it is the nature
	of the soul to be developed by moral precepts.
	Wherefore I shall endeavour to set before you concisely
	by what practices I think you can make the

	repute in the eyes of all other men.

	First of all, then, show devotion to the gods,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] not
	merely by doing sacrifice, but also by keeping your
	vows; for the former is but evidence of a material
	prosperity, whereas the latter is proof of a noble
	character. Do honour to the divine power at all
	times, but especially on occasions of public worship;
	for thus you will have the reputation both of sacrificing
	to the gods and of abiding by the laws.

	Conduct yourself toward your parents as you
	would have your children conduct themselves toward

	Train your body, not by the exercises which
	conduce to strength, but by those which conduce
	to health. In this you will succeed if you cease
	your exertions while you still have energy to exert
	yourself.

	Be not fond of violent mirth, nor harbour presumption
	of speech; for the one is folly, the other
	madness.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Whatever is shameful to do you must not consider
	it honourable even to mention. Accustom yourself
	to be, not of a stern, but of a thoughtful, mien; for
	through the former you will be thought self-willed,
	through the latter, intelligent. Consider that no
	adornment so becomes you as modesty, justice, and
	self-control; for these are the virtues by which, as
	all men are agreed, the character of the young is held
	in restraint.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Never hope to conceal any shameful thing which
	you have done; for even if you do conceal it from
	others, your own heart will know.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Fear the gods, honour your parents, respect your
	friends, obey the laws.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pursue the enjoyments which are of good repute;
	for pleasure attended by honour is the best thing in
	the world, but pleasure without honour is the worst.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Guard yourself against accusations, even if they
	are false; for the multitude are ignorant of the
	truth and look only to reputation. In all things
	resolve to act as though the whole world would see
	what you do; for even if you conceal your deeds
	for the moment, later you will be found out. But
	most of all will you have the respect of men, if you
	are seen to avoid doing things which you would
	blame others for doing.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	If you love knowledge, you will be a master of
	knowledge.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] What you have come to know, preserve
	by exercise; what you have not learned, seek
	to add to your knowledge; for it is as reprehensible
	to hear a profitable saying and not grasp it as to be
	offered a good gift by one’s friends and not accept
	it. Spend your leisure time in cultivating an ear
	attentive to discourse, for in this way you will find
	that you learn with ease what others have found
	out with difficulty. Believe that many precepts are
	better than much wealth; for wealth quickly fails
	us, but precepts abide through all time; for wisdom
	alone of all possessions is imperishable. Do not
	hesitate to travel a long road[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] to those who profess
	to offer some useful instruction; for it were a shame,
	when merchants cross vast seas in order to increase
	their store of wealth, that the young should not
	endure even journeys by land to improve their
	understanding.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Be courteous in your manner, and cordial in your
	address. It is the part of courtesy to greet those
	whom you meet; and of cordiality to enter into
	friendly talk with them. Be pleasant to all, but
	cultivate the best; thus you will avoid the dislike
	of the former and have the friendship of the latter.
	Avoid frequent conversations with the same persons,
	and long conversations on the same subject; for
	there is satiety in all things.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	Train yourself in self-imposed toils, that you may
	be able to endure those which others impose upon
	you.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Practise self-control in all the things by
	which it is shameful for the soul to be controlled,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	namely, gain, temper, pleasure, and pain. You will
	attain such self-control if you regard as gainful those
	things which will increase your reputation and not
	those which will increase your wealth; if you manage
	your temper towards those who offend against you
	as you would expect others to do if you offended
	against them; if you govern your pleasures on the
	principle that it is shameful to rule over one’s servants
	and yet be a slave to one’s desires; and if,
	when you are in trouble, you contemplate the misfortunes
	of others and remind yourself that you are
	human.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Guard more faithfully the secret which is confided
	to you than the money which is entrusted to your
	care; for good men ought to show that they hold their
	honour more trustworthy than an oath. Consider that
	you owe it to yourself no less to mistrust bad men
	than to put your trust in the good. On matters which
	you would keep secret, speak to no one save when
	it is equally expedient for you who speak and for
	those who hear that the facts should not be published.
	Never allow yourself to be put under oath
	save for one of two reasons—in order to clear yourself
	of disgraceful charges or to save your friends from
	great dangers. In matters of money, swear by none
	of the gods, not even when you intend to swear a
	true oath; for you will be suspected on the one
	hand of perjury, on the other of greed.

	him to treat you as he has treated them. Be slow[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	to give your friendship, but when you have given it,
	strive to make it lasting; for it is as reprehensible
	to make many changes in one’s associates as to have
	no friend at all. Neither test your friends to your
	own injury nor be willing to forgo a test of your
	companions. You can manage this if you pretend
	to be in want when really you lack nothing. Confide
	in them about matters which require no secrecy as
	if they were secrets; for if you fail you will not
	injure yourself, and if you succeed you will have a
	better knowledge of their character. Prove your
	friends by means of the misfortunes of life and of
	their fellowship in your perils; for as we try gold in
	the fire, so we come to know our friends when we
	are in misfortune.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] You will best serve your friends
	if you do not wait for them to ask your help, but go
	of your own accord at the crucial moment to lend
	them aid. Consider it equally disgraceful to be outdone
	by your enemies in doing injury and to be
	surpassed by your friends in doing kindness.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Admit
	to your companionship, not those alone who show
	distress at your reverses, but those also who show no
	envy at your good fortune; for there are many who
	sympathize with their friends in adversity, but envy
	them in prosperity.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Mention your absent friends
	to those who are with you, so that they may think
	you do not forget them, in their turn, when they are
	absent.

	In matters of dress, resolve to be a man of taste,
	but not a fop. The man of taste is marked by
	elegance, the fop by excess.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Set not your heart on the excessive acquisition of
	goods, but on a moderate enjoyment of what you
	have. Despise those who strain after riches, but are
	not able to use what they have; they are in like
	case with a man who, being but a wretched horseman,
	gets him a fine mount. Try to make of money
	a thing to use as well as to possess; it is a thing of
	use to those who understand how to enjoy it, and
	a mere possession to those who are able only to
	acquire it. Prize the substance you have for two
	reasons—that you may have the means to meet a
	heavy loss and that you may go to the aid of a
	worthy friend when he is in distress; but for your
	life in general, cherish your possessions not in excess
	but in moderation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Be content with your present lot, but seek a better one.

	Taunt no man with his misfortune; for fate is
	common to all and the future is a thing unseen.

	Bestow your favours on the good; for a goodly
	treasury is a store of gratitude laid up in the heart
	of an honest man. If you benefit bad men, you will
	have the same reward as those who feed stray dogs;
	for these snarl alike at those who give them food
	and at the passing stranger; and just so base men
	wrong alike those who help and those who harm
	them.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	in friends who will risk your displeasure for the
	highest good.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Be affable in your relations with those who approach
	you, and never haughty; for the pride of the
	arrogant even slaves can hardly endure, whereas
	when men are affable all are glad to bear with their
	ways. But to be affable, you must not be quarrelsome,
	nor hard to please, nor always determined to
	have your way; you must not oppose harshly the
	angry moods of your associates, even if they happen to
	be angry without reason, but rather give way to them
	when they are in the heat of passion and rebuke
	them when their anger has cooled; you must avoid
	being serious when the occasion is one for mirth, or
	taking pleasure in mirth when the occasion is serious
	(for what is unseasonable is always offensive); you
	must not bestow your favours ungraciously as do the
	majority who, when they must oblige their friends,
	do it offensively; and you must not be given to
	fault-finding, which is irksome, nor be censorious,
	which is exasperating.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If possible avoid drinking-parties altogether,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but
	if ever occasion arises when you must be present,
	rise and take your leave before you become intoxicated;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	for when the mind is impaired by wine
	it is like chariots which have lost their drivers; for
	just as these plunge along in wild disorder when they
	miss the hands which should guide them, so the soul
	stumbles again and again when the intellect is

	Consider culture to be a good so far superior to

	derives gain from the practice of vice, boorishness[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	When you desire to make a friend of anyone, say

	deliberation, but be prompt to carry out your resolves.
	Consider that as the best thing which we
	have from the gods is good fortune, so the best
	thing which we have in ourselves is good judgement.
	When there is anything of which you are ashamed
	to speak openly, but about which you wish to confer
	with some of your friends, speak as though it were
	another’s affair; thus you will get at their opinion,
	and will not betray your own case. Whenever you
	purpose to consult with any one about your affairs,
	first observe how he has managed his own; for he

	good things which come to you, but grieve in moderation
	over the evils which befall you, and in either case
	do not expose your heart to others;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] for it were strange
	to hide away one’s treasure in the house, and yet
	walk about laying bare one’s feelings to the world.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Be more careful in guarding against censure than
	against danger; for the wicked may well dread the
	end of life, but good men should dread ignominy
	during life. Strive by all means to live in security,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	but if ever it falls to your lot to face the dangers of
	battle, seek to preserve your life, but with honour
	and not with disgrace; for death is the sentence
	which fate has passed on all mankind, but to die
	nobly is the special honour which nature has reserved
	for the good.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Do not be surprised that many things which I
	have said do not apply to you at your present age.
	For I also have not overlooked this fact, but I have
	deliberately chosen to employ this one treatise, not
	only to convey to you advice for your life now, but
	also to leave with you precepts for the years to
	come; for you will then readily perceive the application
	of my precepts, but you will not easily find a
	man who will give you friendly counsel. In order,
	therefore, that you may not seek the rest from
	another source, but that you may draw from this as
	from a treasure-house, I thought that I ought not
	to omit any of the counsels which I have to give you.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And I shall be most grateful to the gods if I am
	not disappointed in the opinion which I have of you.
	For, while we find that the great majority of other
	men seek the society of those friends who join them
	in their follies and not of those who admonish them,
	just as they prefer the most pleasant to the most

	wholesome food,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] you, I think, are minded otherwise,
	as I judge from the industry you display in
	your general education. For when one sets for
	himself the highest standard of conduct, it is probable
	that in his relation to others he will approve only
	of those who exhort him to virtue. But most of all
	would you be spurred on to strive for noble deeds if
	you should realize that it is from them most of all
	that we also derive pleasure in the true sense. For
	while the result of indolence and love of surfeit is
	that pain follows on the heels of pleasure,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] on the
	other hand, devoted toil in the pursuit of virtue, and
	self-control in the ordering of one’s life always yield
	delights that are pure and more abiding. In the
	former case we experience pain following upon
	pleasure, in the latter we enjoy pleasure after pain.
	In all our tasks we are not so much mindful of the
	beginning as we are sensible of the end; for we do
	most things in life not for themselves; it is rather
	for the sake of what results from them that we carry
	on our labours.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Bear in mind that while the base may be pardoned
	for acting without principle, since it is on such a
	foundation that from the first their lives have
	been built, yet the good may not neglect virtue
	without subjecting themselves to rebukes from many
	quarters; for all men despise less those who do
	wrong than those who have claimed to be respectable
	and yet are in fact no better than the common
	run; and rightly, too, for when we condemn those
	who deceive us in words alone, how, pray, can we
	deny the baseness of those who in their whole lives

	belie their promise?[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] We should be right in judging
	that such men not only sin against themselves,
	but are traitors to fortune as well; for fortune
	places in their hands wealth and reputation and
	friends, but they, for their part, make themselves
	unworthy of the blessings which lie within their
	grasp.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And if a mortal may make conjecture of the
	thoughts of the gods, I think that they also have
	revealed very clearly in their treatment of their
	nearest kin how they are disposed to the good and
	base among men. For Zeus, who, as the myths
	relate and all men believe, was the father of Heracles
	and Tantalus, made the one immortal because of his
	virtue, and inflicted on the other the severest punishments
	because of his evil character.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	With these examples before you, you should aspire
	to nobility of character, and not only abide by what
	I have said, but acquaint yourself with the best
	things in the poets as well, and learn from the other
	wise men also any useful lessons they have taught.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	For just as we see the bee settling on all the flowers,
	and sipping the best from each, so also those who
	aspire to culture ought not to leave anything untasted,
	but should gather useful knowledge from
	every source.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] For hardly even with these pains
	can they overcome the defects of nature.

	[b]To Nicocles[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The “Cyprian” orations—[c dimgray]ToNicocles, Nicocles or
	the Cyprians[/c], and especially [c dimgray]Evagoras[/c]—reveal a degree
	of familiarity with the state of affairs in the island
	of Cyprus under the reign of Evagoras which argues
	a first-hand knowledge and even a personal acquaintance
	with the royal house. It may well be that
	Isocrates was introduced to Evagoras and his family
	through the good offices of the Athenian general,
	Conon, or the latter’s son, Timotheus, who had been
	an admiring student under Isocrates.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The relations between Evagoras and Athens were
	close and cordial. He had joined forces with Conon
	at the battle of Cnidus, 394 b.c.; and, in recognition of
	his services, the Athenians elected him to citizenship
	and set up his statue in the Ceramicus side by side
	with that of Conon. Isocrates eulogized him warmly
	in his [c dimgray]Evagoras[/c] and elsewhere, with obvious sincerity
	and probably with justice. Traditionally descended
	from Teucer, the Salaminian hero, Evagoras founded
	the kingdom of New Salamis in Cyprus and made it
	an outpost of Hellenism, which he held vigorously
	against the barbarians of the island and of the
	neighbouring continent, encouraging in the meantime
	the friendliest intercourse between his kingdom
	and the Hellenic world, especially Athens.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	He died in 374 b.c., and was succeeded by his son,
	Nicocles. It was probably shortly after this that
	Isocrates presented to the young king this compendium
	of advice on how a ruler should conduct
	himself toward his subjects. The discourse is written
	in the somewhat formal tone of a master to a pupil,
	and it is probable that Nicocles had been a member
	of Isocrates’ school.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] At any rate it is clear that
	Nicocles appreciated the orator and made him
	handsome presents.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This discourse, like that addressed to Demonicus,
	is an ethical dissertation in which precepts of worldly
	wisdom are imperfectly blended with lofty sentiments,
	all somewhat loosely put together under
	different heads.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Isocrates was no doubt criticized for the sympathy
	with monarchy which he here seems to betray; for
	in the [c dimgray]Antidosis[/c] he defends himself by saying that he
	expressed himself to Nicocles “as a free man and
	an Athenian should, not paying court to his wealth
	nor to his power, but pleading the cause of his
	subjects.”[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	When men make it a habit, Nicocles, to bring to you
	who are rulers of kingdoms articles of dress or of
	bronze or of wrought gold,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] or other such valuables
	of which they themselves have need and you have
	plenty, it seems to me all too evident that they
	are not engaged in giving but in bargaining, and
	that they are much more skilful in disposing of their
	wares than those who are professedly in trade. For
	my part, I should think that this would be the finest
	and the most serviceable present and the most

	For when men are in private life, many things
	contribute to their education: first and foremost,
	the absence of luxury among them, and the necessity

	may reasonably be expected to become better men.
	Kings, however, have no such help; on the contrary,
	they, who more than other men should be thoroughly
	trained, live all their lives, from the time when they
	are placed in authority, without admonition; for the
	great majority of people do not come in contact with
	them, and those who are of their society consort
	with them to gain their favour. Indeed, although
	they are placed in authority over vast wealth and
	mighty affairs, they have brought it about because
	of their misuse of these advantages that many debate
	whether it were best to choose the life of men in
	private station who are reasonably prosperous, or
	the life of princes. For when men look at their
	honours, their wealth, and their powers, they all
	think that those who are in the position of kings are
	the equals of the gods; but when they reflect on
	their fears and their dangers, and when, as they
	review the history of monarchs, they see instances
	where they have been slain by those from whom
	they least deserved that fate, other instances where
	they have been constrained to sin against those
	nearest and dearest to them, and still others where
	they have experienced both of these calamities, then
	they reverse their judgement and conclude that it is
	better to live in any fashion whatsoever than, at the
	price of such misfortunes, to rule over all Asia. And
	the cause of this inconsistency and confusion is that
	men believe that the office of king is, like that of
	priest,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] one which any man can fill, whereas it is the
	most important of human functions and demands
	the greatest wisdom.

	the business of those who are at the time associated
	with a king to advise him how he may handle it in
	the best way possible, and how he may both preserve
	what is good and prevent disaster; but as regards a
	king’s conduct in general, I shall attempt to set forth
	the objects at which he should aim and the pursuits
	to which he should devote himself. Whether the
	gift when finished shall be worthy of the design, it
	is hard to tell at the beginning; for many writings
	both in verse and in prose, while still in the minds
	of their composers, have aroused high expectations;
	but when completed and shown to the world have
	won a repute far inferior to their promise. And yet
	the mere attempt is well worth while—to seek a field
	that has been neglected by others and lay down
	principles for monarchs; for those who educate men
	in private stations benefit them alone, but if one can
	turn those who rule over the multitude toward a life
	of virtue, he will help both classes, both those who
	hold positions of authority and their subjects; for
	he will give to kings a greater security in office and
	to the people a milder government.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	First, then, we must consider what is the function
	of kings; for if we can properly encompass the
	essence of the whole matter in a general principle[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	we shall, with this before us, speak to better purpose
	about its parts. I think that all would agree that it
	is a king’s business to relieve the state when it is in
	distress, to maintain it in prosperity, and to make it
	great when it is small; for it is with these ends in
	view that the other duties which present themselves
	day by day must be performed. And surely this

	much is clear, that those who are able to do all this,
	and who pronounce on matters of so great moment,
	must not be indolent nor careless, but must see to it
	that they are superior to all others in intelligence;
	for it is evident that they will reign well or ill according
	to the manner in which they equip their own
	minds.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Therefore, no athlete is so called upon to
	train his body as is a king to train his soul;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] for
	not all the public festivals in the world offer a prize
	comparable to those for which you who are kings
	strive every day of your lives.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This thought you must lay to heart, and see to it
	that in proportion as you are above the others in
	rank so shall you surpass them in virtue; and do not
	hold the view that while diligence is of use in all
	other matters it is of no avail to make us better and
	wiser; and do not deem us, the human kind, so unfortunate
	that, although in dealing with wild beasts
	we have discovered arts by which we tame their
	spirits and increase their worth, yet in our own case
	we are powerless to help ourselves in the pursuit of
	virtue.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] On the contrary, be convinced that education
	and diligence are in the highest degree potent
	to improve our nature, and associate yourself with
	the wisest of those who are about you and send for
	the wisest men from abroad whenever this is possible.
	And do not imagine that you can afford to be
	ignorant of any one either of the famous poets or of
	the sages; rather you should listen to the poets and

	assumed that one must be who is to perform properly
	the duties of a king, and to govern the state as he

	on matters about which there is mutual dispute, do
	not render decisions which exhibit favouritism or
	inconsistency, but let your verdicts on the same
	issues be always the same; for it is both right and
	expedient that the judgements of kings on questions
	of justice should be invariable, like wisely ordained
	laws. Manage the city as you would your ancestral
	estate: in the matter of its appointments, splendidly
	and royally; in the matter of its revenues, strictly,
	in order that you may possess the good opinion of
	your people and at the same time have sufficient
	means. Display magnificence, not in any of the
	extravagant outlays which straightway vanish, but
	in the ways which I have mentioned, and in the
	beauty of the objects which you possess, and in the
	benefits which you bestow upon your friends; for
	such expenditures will not be lost to you while you
	live, and you will leave to those who follow you a
	heritage worth more than what you have spent.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In the worship of the gods, follow the example of
	your ancestors, but believe that the noblest sacrifice
	and the greatest devotion is to show yourself in the
	highest degree a good and just man; for such
	men have greater hope of enjoying a blessing from

	Deal with weaker states as you would expect stronger

	everything you say or do, but those who criticize

	who have good judgement, in order that when you
	are in doubt you may have friends who will help you
	to decide. Distinguish between those who artfully
	flatter and those who loyally serve you, that the base
	may not fare better than the good. Listen to what
	men say about each other and try to discern at the

	example to the rest, realizing that the manners of
	the whole state are copied from its rulers.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Let it
	be a sign to you that you rule wisely if you see all
	your subjects growing more prosperous and more
	temperate because of your oversight. Consider it
	more important to leave to your children a good
	name than great riches; for riches endure for a day,
	a good name for all time; a good name may bring

	sumptuous in your dress and personal adornment,

	and that those who are intimate with you may form
	the same opinion from your strength of soul.

	Keep watch always on your words and actions,
	that you may fall into as few mistakes as possible.
	For while it is best to grasp your opportunities at

	to discern, choose to fall short rather than to overreach
	them;[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] for the happy mean is to be found
	in defect rather than in excess. Try to combine
	courtesy with dignity; for dignity is in keeping with
	the position of a king and courtesy is becoming in
	his social intercourse. Yet no admonition is so difficult
	to carry out as this; for you will find that for

	while those who desire to be courteous appear to
	lower themselves; yet you should cultivate both
	these qualities and try to avoid the danger that
	attaches to each. Whenever you desire to gain a
	thorough understanding of such things as it is fitting
	that kings should know, pursue them by practice as
	well as by study; for study will show you the way,
	but training yourself in the actual doing of things
	will give you power to deal with affairs.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Reflect on the fortunes and accidents which befall
	both common men and kings, for if you are mindful
	of the past you will plan better for the future.
	Consider that where there are common men who are
	ready to lay down their lives[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] that they may be
	praised after they are dead, it is shameful for kings
	not to have the courage to pursue a course of conduct
	from which they will gain renown during their
	lives. Prefer to leave behind you as a memorial
	images of your character rather than of your body.
	Put forth every effort to preserve your own and your
	state’s security, but if you are compelled to risk
	your life, choose to die with honour rather than
	to live in shame.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] In all your actions remember that
	you are a king, and take care never to do anything
	which is beneath the dignity of your station.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Do not suffer your life to be at once wholly blotted
	out, but since you were allotted a perishable body,
	seek to leave behind an imperishable memorial of
	your soul.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Make it your practice to talk of things
	that are good and honourable, that your thoughts
	may through habit come to be like your words.
	Whatever seems to you upon careful thought to be
	the best course, put this into effect. If there are

	counsel. Regard as wise men, not those who dispute
	subtly about trifling matters, but those who speak
	well on the great issues;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and not those who, being
	themselves in sorry straits, hold forth to others the

	are some who have uttered one or another of these
	precepts, some who have heard them, some who
	have observed other people put them into practice,
	and some who are carrying them out in their own

	we should not seek novelties, for in these discourses
	it is not possible to say what is paradoxical or
	incredible or outside the circle of accepted belief;

	whether in verse or prose, are the most useful which
	counsel us how to live, yet it is certainly not to them
	that they listen with greatest pleasure; nay, they
	feel about these just as they feel about the people
	who admonish them; for while they praise the latter,
	they choose for associates[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] those who share in, and
	not those who would dissuade them from, their faults.
	As a case in point, one might cite the poetry of
	Hesiod and Theognis and Phocylides;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] for these,
	they say, have proved the best counsellors for human
	conduct; but in spite of what they say, people
	prefer to occupy themselves with each other’s follies
	rather than with the admonitions of these teachers.
	And, again, if one were to make a selection from
	the leading poets of their maxims, as we call them,
	into which they have put their best thought, men
	would show a similar attitude toward them also;
	for they would lend a readier ear to the cheapest
	comedy[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] than to the creations of such finished art.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Yet why should I spend time in giving single
	instances? For if we are willing to survey human
	nature as a whole, we shall find that the majority
	of men do not take pleasure in the food[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] that is
	the most wholesome, nor in the pursuits that are the
	most honourable, nor in the actions that are the
	noblest, nor in the creatures that are the most
	useful, but that they have tastes which are in every
	way contrary to their best interests, while they view
	those who have some regard for their duty as men
	of austere and laborious lives. How, then, can one

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Theognis and Phocylides (middle of sixth century) were

	and we have over a thousand of his verses. Phocylides
	survives in but a few fragments. Hesiod is classed with them because in his epic [c dimgray]The Works and Days[/c] are scattered
	many maxims.

	advise or teach or say anything of profit and yet
	please such people? For, besides what I have said
	of them, they look upon men of wisdom with suspicion,
	while they regard men of no understanding as
	open and sincere; and they so shun the verities of life
	that they do not even know their own interests:
	nay, it irks them to take account of their own business
	and it delights them to discuss the business of
	others; and they would rather be ill in body than
	exert the soul and give thought to anything in the
	line of duty. Observe them when they are in each
	other’s company, and you will find them giving and
	taking abuse; observe them when they are by
	themselves, and you will find them occupied, not
	with plans, but with idle dreams. I am, however,
	speaking now not of all, but of those only who are
	open to the charges I have made.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This much, however, is clear, that those who
	aim to write anything in verse or prose which will
	make a popular appeal should seek out, not the
	most profitable discourses, but those which most
	abound in fictions; for the ear delights in these
	just as the eye delights in games and contests.
	Wherefore we may well admire the poet Homer and
	the first inventors of tragedy, seeing that they, with
	true insight into human nature, have embodied both
	kinds of pleasure in their poetry; for Homer has
	dressed the contests and battles of the demigods in
	myths, while the tragic poets have rendered the
	myths in the form of contests and action, so that
	they are presented, not to our ears alone, but to our
	eyes as well. With such models, then, before us, it
	is evident that those who desire to command the
	attention of their hearers must abstain from admonition

	and advice, and must say the kind of things
	which they see are most pleasing to the crowd.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I have dwelt on these matters because I think
	that you, who are not one of the multitude but a
	king over the multitude, ought not to be of the same
	mind as men at large; you ought not to judge what
	things are worthy or what men are wise by the
	standard of pleasure, but to appraise them in the light
	of conduct that is useful; especially, since the teachers
	of philosophy, however much they debate about
	the proper discipline of the soul (some contending
	that it is through disputation,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] others that it is
	through political discussion, others that it is through
	other means that their disciples are to attain to
	greater wisdom), yet are all agreed on this, that the
	well-educated man must, as the result of his training
	in whatever discipline, show ability to deliberate and
	decide. You should, therefore, avoid what is in controversy
	and test men’s value in the light of what is
	generally agreed upon, if possible taking careful note
	of them when they present their views on particular
	situations; or, if that is not possible, when they
	discuss general questions. And when they are
	altogether lacking in what they ought to know,
	reject them (for it is clear that if one is of no use in
	himself, neither can he make another man wise);
	but when they are intelligent and able to see farther
	than the rest, prize them and cherish them, knowing
	that a good counsellor is the most useful and the
	most princely of all possessions. And believe that
	those contribute most to the greatness of your reign
	who can contribute most to your understanding.

	counsels which I know, and I honour you with these

	[c darkmagenta][b]ISOCRATES, Discourses 3. Nicocles, or the Cyprians[/b][/c]
	[b]Nicocles[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The circulation among the friends of Nicocles of
	the treatise directed to the young king on the duties
	of monarchs[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] no doubt prompted the suggestion
	that a companion piece be written on the duties of
	a king’s subjects. Perhaps the hint came from
	Nicocles himself, who may have thought “that the
	perception of a king’s obligations which the former
	work may have quickened in some Salaminians might
	be usefully compensated by a sense of their own.”[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The fact that the “companion” discourse is put
	in the mouth of Nicocles does not necessarily signify
	that it was intended to be published as Nicocles’ own
	composition, but more probably that Isocrates
	desired, in this way, to put himself in the king’s
	place and state the case for monarchy from the
	royalist point of view.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] We need not, however,
	regard his argument as a specious plea, “written to
	order.”[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Isocrates was not blind to the advantages
	of monarchy, and there was in his mind as the years
	went on a drift of sympathy away from what he

	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Just as Herodotus puts a plea for one-man rule in the
	mouth of Dareius, iii. 82. In Isocrates’ [c dimgray]Archidamus[/c] we
	have a similar attempt to see a situation through another’s
	eyes.

	[m1]\ [/m][b]Nicocles[/b]
	looked upon as the slackness and irresponsibility of
	contemporary democracy towards a more centralized
	and vigorous rule.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] His ideal of government was the
	limited democracy of Solon, the virtues of which he
	regarded as a legacy from the monarchy which it
	succeeded;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and it is significant that the good
	points which he attributes to monarchy in [c dimgray]Nicocles[/c]
	are elsewhere associated by him with the Athenian
	democracy as it was in the good old times before the
	“rule of the best” had given way to the “rule of
	the mob.”[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Indeed it may well be that the idealization
	of monarchy in [c dimgray]Nicocles[/c] has in part the same
	purpose as his idealization of the early democracy of
	Athens in [c dimgray]Areopagiticus,Panegyricus[/c],and [c dimgray]Panathenaicus[/c]—that
	of pointing a contrast to the weaknesses of
	popular government in his own time.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The discourse was written after Nicocles had ruled
	for some time,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] probably between 372 and 365 b.c.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]

	[b]III. Nicocles Or The Cyprians[/b]
	There are people who frown upon eloquence and
	censure men who study philosophy,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] asserting that
	those who engage in such occupations do so, not for
	the sake of virtue, but for their own advantage. Now,
	I should be glad if those who take this position would
	tell me why they blame men who are ambitious to
	speak well, but applaud men who desire to act
	rightly; for if it is the pursuit of one’s own advantage
	which gives them offence, we shall find that more and
	greater advantages are gained from actions than
	from speech. Moreover, it is passing strange if the
	fact has escaped them that we reverence the gods
	and practise justice, and cultivate the other virtues,
	not that we may be worse off than our fellows, but
	that we may pass our days in the enjoyment of as
	many good things as possible. They should not,
	therefore, condemn these means by which one may
	gain advantage[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] without sacrifice of virtue, but
	rather those men who do wrong in their actions or
	who deceive by their speech and put their eloquence
	to unjust uses.

	wealth and strength and courage; for if they are
	really hostile to eloquence because there are men
	who do wrong and speak falsehood, they ought to
	disparage as well all other good things; for there
	will be found also among men who possess these
	some who do wrong and use these advantages to
	the injury of many.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Nevertheless, it is not
	fair to decry strength because there are persons
	who assault people whom they encounter, nor to
	traduce courage because there are those who
	slay men wantonly, nor in general to transfer to
	things the depravity of men, but rather to put
	the blame on the men themselves who misuse the
	good things, and who, by the very powers which
	might help their fellow-countrymen, endeavour to
	do them harm.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But the fact is that since they have not taken the
	trouble to make distinctions after this manner in each
	instance, they are ill-disposed to all eloquence; and
	they have gone so far astray as not to perceive that
	they are hostile to that power which of all the faculties
	that belong to the nature of man is the source of most
	of our blessings. For in the other powers which we
	possess we are in no respect superior to other living
	creatures; nay, we are inferior to many in swiftness
	and in strength and in other resources; but, because
	there has been implanted in us the power to persuade
	each other and to make clear to each other whatever
	we desire, not only have we escaped the life of wild
	beasts, but we have come together and founded cities

	which the power of speech has not helped us to
	establish.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For this it is which has laid down laws
	concerning things just and unjust, and things base
	and honourable; and if it were not for these ordinances
	we should not be able to live with one another.
	It is by this also that we confute the bad and extol
	the good. Through this we educate the ignorant
	and appraise the wise; for the power to speak well
	is taken as the surest index of a sound understanding,
	and discourse which is true and lawful and just is the
	outward image of a good and faithful soul. With
	this faculty we both contend against others on
	matters which are open to dispute and seek light for
	ourselves on things which are unknown; for the
	same arguments which we use in persuading others
	when we speak in public, we employ also when we
	deliberate in our own thoughts; and, while we call
	eloquent those who are able to speak before a crowd,
	we regard as sage those who most skilfully debate
	their problems in their own minds. And, if there is
	need to speak in brief summary of this power, we
	shall find that none of the things which are done with
	intelligence take place without the help of speech,
	but that in all our actions as well as in all our thoughts
	speech is our guide, and is most employed by those
	who have the most wisdom. Therefore, those who
	dare to speak with disrespect of educators and
	teachers of philosophy deserve our opprobrium no
	less than those who profane the sanctuaries of the
	gods.

	however, I regard those as the best and most worthy
	of a king, and most appropriate to me, which give
	directions on good morals and good government;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	and especially those which teach how men in power
	should deal with the people, and how the rank and
	file should be disposed to their rulers. For I observe
	that it is through such discourses that states attain
	the highest prosperity and greatness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	On the former topic, how a ruler should act, you
	have heard Isocrates speak; on the following topic,
	what his subjects must do, I shall attempt to discourse,
	not with any thought of excelling him, but
	because this is the most fitting subject for me to
	discuss with you. For if I did not make clear what
	I desire you to do, I could not reasonably be angry
	with you if you were to mistake my purpose; but
	if, after I have announced my policy beforehand,
	none of my desires are carried out, then I should
	justly blame those who fail to obey me.

	And I believe that I should most effectively exhort
	you and urge you to remember my words and heed

	advice and then, after counting out my precepts,
	make an end, but if, before doing this, I should
	prove to you, first, that you ought to be content
	with our present government, not only from necessity,
	nor because we have lived under it all our lives,
	but because it is the best of all governments; and,
	second, that I hold this office, not illegally nor as a

	Speaking, then, of forms of government (for this
	was the subject I set out to lay before you), I imagine
	that we all believe that it is altogether monstrous[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	that the good and the bad should be thought
	worthy of the same privileges, and that it is of the
	very essence of justice that distinctions should be
	made between them, and that those who are unlike
	should not be treated alike but should fare and be
	rewarded in each case according to their deserts.
	Now oligarchies and democracies seek equality for
	those who share in the administration of them; and
	the doctrine is in high favour in those governments
	that one man should not have the power to get more
	than another—a principle which works in the interest
	of the worthless! Monarchies, on the other
	hand, make the highest award to the best man, the
	next highest to the next best, and in the same
	proportion to the third and the fourth and so on.
	Even if this practice does not obtain everywhere,
	such at least is the intention of the polity. And,
	mark you, monarchies more than other governments
	keep an appraising eye upon the characters and
	actions of men, as everyone will admit Who, then,
	that is of sound mind would not prefer to share in a
	form of government under which his own worth
	shall not pass unnoticed, rather than be lost in the
	hurly-burly of the mob and not be recognized for
	what he is? Furthermore, we should be right in
	pronouncing monarchy also a milder government, in
	proportion as it is easier to give heed to the will of

	Now one might multiply arguments to prove that
	this form of government is more agreeable and mild
	and just than others; yet, even from those I have
	advanced it is easy to see this at a glance. As for
	its other advantages, we can best appreciate how far
	monarchies excel other governments in planning
	and carrying out any course of action required of
	them if we place their most important practices side
	by side and try to review them. In the first place,
	then, men who enter upon office for an annual term
	are retired to private life before they have gained
	any insight into public affairs or any experience in
	handling them; while men who are permanently in
	charge of the same duties, even though they fall
	short of the others in natural ability, at any rate have
	a great advantage over them in experience. In the
	next place, the former neglect many things, because
	each looks to the others to do them; while the
	latter neglect nothing, knowing that whatever is
	done depends upon their own efforts. Then again,
	men who live in oligarchies or democracies are led
	by their mutual rivalries to injure the common-wealth;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	while those who live in monarchies, not
	having anyone to envy, do in all circumstances so
	far as possible what is best. Furthermore, the
	former are dilatory in action,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] for they spend most
	of their time over their private concerns; and when
	they do assemble in council, you will find them more
	often quarrelling[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] with each other than deliberating

	together; while the latter, for whom no councils or
	times of meeting are prescribed, but who apply
	themselves to the state’s business both day and night,
	do not let opportunities pass them by, but act in
	each case at the right moment. Again, the former
	are ill-disposed toward each other and would rather
	have their predecessors and their successors in office
	administer the state as badly as possible, in order
	that they may win for themselves as much credit as
	possible; while the latter, because they are in control
	of affairs throughout their lives, are at all times
	actuated by feelings of good will. But the greatest
	difference is this: men under other governments
	give attention to the affairs of state as if they were

	their own concern;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and the former employ as their

	And not only in matters of ordinary routine and

	And of this one may be assured by facts no less than
	by words; for, in the first place, we all know that the
	empire of the Persians attained its great magnitude,
	not because of the intelligence of the population, but
	because they more than other peoples respect the
	royal office; secondly, that Dionysius,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] the tyrant,
	taking charge of Sicily when the rest of it had
	been devastated by war and when his own country,
	Syracuse, was in a state of siege, not only delivered
	it from the dangers which then threatened, but also
	made it the greatest of Hellenic states; and again,
	we know that while the Carthaginians and the
	Lacedaemonians, who are the best governed peoples
	of the world,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] are ruled by oligarchies at home, yet,
	when they take the field, they are ruled by kings.
	One might also point out that the state[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] which more
	than any other abhors absolute rule meets with disaster
	when it sends out many generals,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and with
	success when it wages war under a single leader.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And, indeed, how could any one show more convincingly
	than through these instances that monarchy
	is the most excellent of governments? For we see
	that those who are permanently ruled by kings have
	the greatest powers; that those who live in well-conducted oligarchies, when it comes to matters
	about which they are most concerned, appoint one
	man, in some cases a general, in others a king, to
	have full powers over their armies in the field; and
	that those who abhor absolute rule, whenever they
	send out many leaders, fail to accomplish a single
	one of their designs. And, if there is need to

	the truth about this matter, and we by our own
	conjecture have simply supposed it to be so, it is
	a proof that we all hold monarchy in the highest
	esteem; for we should never have said that the
	gods live under it if we did not believe it to be far
	superior to all other governments.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now as to polities, while it is not possible either
	to search out or declare every detail in which they
	differ from each other, yet for our present purpose,
	at least, enough has been said. But to show that I
	hold my office by natural right is a story much
	sooner told and less open to dispute. For who does
	not know how Teucer, the founder of our race,
	taking with him the ancestors of the rest of our
	people, came hither over seas and built for them a
	city and portioned out the land; and that, after his
	other descendants had lost the throne, my father,
	Evagoras, won it back again by undergoing the
	greatest dangers, and wrought so great a change
	that Phoenicians no longer rule over Salaminians,
	while they, to whom it belonged in the beginning,
	are to-day in possession of the kingdom?[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now, of the matters which I proposed to discuss,
	it remains for me to speak to you about myself, in
	order that you may realize that I, who rule over
	you, am of such character that, not only on account
	of my ancestors, but of myself also, I might justly
	claim even greater honour than I now enjoy. For
	I think you would all agree that the most sovereign

	of the virtues are temperance and justice, since not
	only do they benefit us in themselves, but, if we
	should be minded to look into the natures, powers,
	and uses of human relations, we would find that
	those which do not partake[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of these qualities are
	the causes of great evils, whereas those which are
	attended by temperance and justice are greatly
	beneficial to the life of man. If, then, any of my
	predecessors have gained renown for these virtues,
	I consider that it is also my right to enjoy the same
	renown.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As to my sense of justice, you can best observe it
	from these facts:[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] When I was established in power
	I found the royal treasury empty, all the revenues
	squandered, the affairs of the state in utter disorder
	and calling for great care, watchfulness, and outlay
	of money; and, although I knew that rulers of the
	other sort in similar straits resort to every shift in
	order to right their own affairs, and that they feel
	constrained to do many things which are against
	their nature, nevertheless I did not fall a victim
	to any of these temptations; nay, I attended so
	devotedly and honourably to my duties that I left
	nothing undone which could contribute to the greatness
	of the state and advance its prosperity; and
	toward the citizens of the state I behaved with such
	mildness that no one has suffered exile or death or
	confiscation of property or any such misfortune during
	my reign. And though Hellas was closed to us

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]We may surmise that the death of the strong and resourceful Evagoras plunged the affairs of Salamis and

	reduced to order by his successor, but we possess no further
	details of this history than those which are here set down.

	were being robbed on every side, I solved most of
	these difficulties, paying to some their claims in
	full, to others in part, asking some to postpone theirs,
	and satisfying others as to their complaints by whatever
	means I could. Furthermore, though the inhabitants
	of the island were hostile to me, and the
	Great King, while outwardly reconciled, was really
	in an ugly mood, I calmed and appeased both parties
	by assisting the King zealously and by treating the
	islanders justly. For I am so far from coveting what
	belongs to others that, while rulers of the other sort,
	when they are stronger than their neighbours by
	ever so little, cut off portions of their territory and
	seek to get the advantage of them, I did not think it
	right to take even the land which was offered to me,
	but prefer rather to hold through just means what
	is my own than to acquire through base means
	territory many times greater than that which I now
	possess. But why need I take the time to speak in
	detail, especially when I can make clear in a word
	the truth about myself? For it will be acknowledged
	that I have never wronged any man; that, on the
	contrary, I have been of service to many more of
	my own citizens and of the Hellenes at large and
	have bestowed upon them both greater gifts than all
	who have ruled before me put together. And surely
	those who pride themselves on justice and who profess
	to be above considerations of money ought to
	be able to speak in such high terms of their own
	conduct.

	resent offences against them, and that wantonness
	in these relations is responsible for the greatest
	evils—many ere now, of princely rank as well as of
	private station, having lost their lives because of it—,
	I so strictly avoided all these grounds of offence
	that, from the time when I became king, no one
	can charge me with having approached any woman
	but my own wife. I was not, of course, unaware
	that those kings also are highly thought of by the
	multitude who are just in their dealings with their
	citizens, even though they provide themselves with
	pleasures from outside their households; but I desired
	both to put myself as far above such suspicions as
	possible and at the same time to set up my conduct
	as a pattern to my people, knowing that the multitude
	are likely to spend their lives in practices in
	which they see their rulers occupied.

	Then again, I considered that it is also the duty of
	kings to be as much better than private citizens as
	they are superior to them in rank; and that those
	kings act contrary to all reason who compel their
	subjects to live decently but are themselves less
	continent than those over whom they rule. Moreover,
	I saw that while the majority of people are
	masters of themselves in other matters, even the
	best are slaves to the passions whose objects are
	boys and women; and therefore I wanted to show
	that I could be strong in those things in which I
	should be superior, not merely to people in general,
	but even to those who pride themselves on their
	virtue. Furthermore, I had no patience with the
	perversity of men who take women in marriage and
	make them partners in all the relations of life, and then
	are not satisfied with the compacts which they have

	made but by their own lawless pleasures bring pain to
	those whom they expect never to cause [c dimgray]them[/c] pain;
	and who, though honest in all other partnerships,
	are without conscience in the partnership of marriage,
	when they ought to cherish this relationship the more
	faithfully inasmuch as it is more intimate and more
	precious than all others. More than that, they are
	unconsciously storing up for themselves feuds and
	factions at home in the royal palace. And yet,
	if kings are to rule well, they must try to preserve
	harmony, not only in the states over which they
	hold dominion, but also in their own households and
	in their places of abode; for all these things are the
	works of temperance and justice. Nor was I of the
	same mind as most kings in regard to the begetting
	of children. I did not think I should have some
	children by a woman of humbler station and others
	by one of higher degree, nor that I should leave
	after me bastard progeny, as well as progeny of
	legitimate birth; but that all my children should be
	able to trace their lineage back through the same
	father and the same mother to Evagoras, my father,

	saw that courage and cleverness and the other

	temperance are the possessions of the good and noble
	alone. I conceived, therefore, that the noblest thing

	that I could do was to be able to excel my fellows in
	those virtues in which the bad have no share, and
	which are the truest and the most abiding and deserve
	the greatest praise. For these reasons, and
	with these thoughts in mind, I was more assiduous
	than anyone else in the practice of temperance, and
	I chose for my pleasures, not those which are found
	in acts which yield no honour, but those which are
	found in the good repute which rewards nobility of
	character. However, we ought not to test all the
	virtues in the same set of conditions, but should test
	justice when a man is in want, temperance when he
	is in power, continence when he is in the prime of
	youth. Now in all these situations no one will deny
	that I have given proof of my nature. When I
	was left by my father without means, I was so
	just in my dealings as to injure not one of my
	citizens; but when I gained the power to do whatever
	I pleased, I proved myself more temperate
	than men in private station; and I showed my self-
	control in both circumstances at an age in which we
	find that the great majority of men most frequently
	go morally astray.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I should probably hesitate to say all this before
	an audience of other people, not that I lack pride
	in what I have accomplished, but because I might
	fail to convince them on the evidence of my words
	alone; you, however, are yourselves my witnesses
	that all I have said is true. Now men who are
	moral by nature deserve our praise and admiration,
	but still more do those deserve it who are
	such in obedience to reason; for those who are
	temperate by chance and not by principle may
	perchance be persuaded to change, but those who,

	besides being so inclined by nature, have formed
	the conviction that virtue is the greatest good in the
	world, will, it is evident, stand firm in this position
	all their lives.

	But the reason why I have spoken at some length

	have discussed is that I might leave you no excuse

	counsel and command.

	I declare it to be the duty of each one of you to
	perform whatever tasks you are assigned with diligence
	and justice; for if you fall short in either of
	these qualities, your conduct must needs suffer by
	that defect. Do not belittle nor despise a single one
	of your appointed tasks, thinking that nothing depends
	upon it; but, knowing that the whole depends
	for its success or failure on each of the parts, be
	careful in everything. Display no less concern in
	my interests than in your own, and do not think that
	the honours enjoyed by those who successfully administer
	my affairs are a small reward. Keep your
	hands off the possessions of others in order that you
	may be more secure in the possession of your own
	estates. You should be such in your dealings with
	others as you expect me to be in my dealings with
	you. Do not strive to gain riches rather than a
	good name, knowing that both among the Hellenes
	and the barbarians as well those who have the
	highest reputation for virtue have at their command
	the greatest number of good things. Consider that
	the making of money unjustly will produce, not
	wealth, but danger. Do not think that getting is
	gain or spending is loss; for neither the one nor the
	other has the same significance at all times, but

	conduct themselves toward you, so you also should
	conduct yourselves toward my rule.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And if you do this, why need I speak at length of
	what the results will be? For if I continue to treat
	you as in time past, and you continue to give me
	your service and support, you will soon see your own
	life advanced, my empire increased, and the state
	made happy and prosperous. You could, therefore,
	well afford, for the sake of blessings so great, to spare
	no effort and even to undergo all manner of toil and
	peril; and yet it lies in your power, without suffering
	any hardship, but merely by being loyal and true, to
	bring all these things to pass.

	[b]Panegyricus[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c] was published at a time[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] when the
	power and influence of Athens were at a low ebb
	and when the Hellenic world generally was in a
	sorry state. The empire which Athens had built
	upon her acknowledged leadership in driving the
	Persians out of Greece had been shattered by the
	Peloponnesian War. The supremacy to which Sparta
	succeeded at the end of that war[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] soon proved a
	selfish tyranny which so stirred up hatred among the
	Greek cities and factions within them as to destroy
	whatever of pan-Hellenic sentiment had been engendered
	by the Persian Wars and to invite the barbarian
	to interfere in the affairs of Hellas.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The crowning shame of this condition of affairs
	was the so-called Peace of Antalcidas (negotiated in
	387 b.c., mainly by Sparta), under the terms of which
	the Greeks submitted themselves formally, for the
	first time in history, to the overlordship of the Persian
	king, accepting him as the arbiter of their disputes
	and as the guardian of the “autonomy” of the Greek
	states in their relations to each other.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But this sacrifice of their pride gained for the
	Hellenes neither the “autonomy” nor the “peace”
	which the treaty guaranteed.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Sparta continued to

	wage war on Greek states[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and to stir up faction
	and bloodshed within them.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] The Athenian fleet no
	longer patrolled the sea, and pirates infested the
	Aegean.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] The several states, exhausted by war and
	civil strife, were unable to support their populations,
	and men sought to escape from poverty and want
	at home by enlisting in foreign service under any
	leader who could hold out to them a prospect of
	pay or pillage. These bands of mercenaries, growing
	in numbers and in recklessness, became a
	positive menace to the security of the home-staying
	population.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is from these intolerable circumstances that
	Isocrates in the [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c] seeks to persuade the
	Greeks to deliver themselves. They cannot, he
	insists, go on with their suicidal wars; the strife
	which is sapping their very life must be brought to
	an end. There is, however, but one way to establish
	concord among the several states and that is to enlist
	their mutual rivalries in a common cause—to carry
	the war from Hellas into Asia and to wrest from the
	barbarians the power and wealth which the Hellenes
	now seek to gain from each other. Concord among
	the Greeks, war upon the barbarians—the complete
	triumph of Hellenism by a final and thorough-going
	conquest of Persia—is the central theme of the
	discourse.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But there is the difficult question of leadership in
	this crusade. Sparta, now the leading state, has
	abused her power and involved Greece in her present
	weakness and humiliation. She must suffer a change
	of heart and join with Athens in the war of deliverance.

	But Athens must regain her lost supremacy;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	she alone, by her past history, has proved not only
	her right but her capacity to unite the Greeks in a
	common cause. The author sketches with sincere
	eloquence the glorious services of Athens to Hellas—Athens,
	the mother of civilization; author of material
	prosperity no less than of the institutions and the
	arts of the cultivated life; beneficent in the exercise
	of the supremacy which of old was conceded to her,
	using her power, not to enslave, but to help the weaker
	states; risking her very existence in the Persian
	Wars for the freedom of all the Hellenes; and always
	without fail the champion of Hellenism against the
	menace of the Persian empire—and rests on this
	record her claim to take the lead in this great
	enterprise.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Isocrates insists that the enterprise is entirely
	practicable. The Persians are an effeminate people
	with no genius or strength for war. They have
	prospered only by the help of the Greeks or by
	playing one Greek power against another; they
	have never succeeded and can never stand against
	a united Hellas. If only the Greeks can be persuaded
	to make common cause against them, their
	advance upon the barbarians “will be more like a
	sacred mission than a military expedition.”

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Isocrates, in tactful recognition of the present position
	of Sparta, speaks in one or two passages of the [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c]
	as if he had in mind a dual leadership; but the discourse
	as a whole (see especially 99) is both a challenge to Athens
	to lead in the expedition (compare [c dimgray]Phil.[/c] 127) and to the
	rest of the Greeks to accept her leadership. Moreover in
	the [c dimgray]Antidosis[/c], 57, 58, Isocrates expressly states that this was
	the purpose of the [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c].

	discourses of Isocrates, and the first and foremost in
	which he devotes his eloquence to his dream of pan-
	Hellenism.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] It betrays the great pains taken in its
	composition by the extreme finish of its style and the
	careful elaborateness of its structure; but throughout
	its involved rhetorical periods there breathes a
	genuine feeling and a lofty tone. It established
	his fame in antiquity, and was recognized then as
	now as his masterpiece.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The title was chosen by Isocrates himself,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] no
	doubt to signify its appropriateness to be delivered
	before a pan-Hellenic gathering at Olympia, where
	Gorgias and Lysias had actually spoken on the same
	theme before him.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] It is, however, certain that it
	was not delivered by Isocrates;[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and, although
	it may have been read aloud on such an occasion
	by another, it was probably written as a political
	pamphlet and circulated among a reading public.

	Many times have I wondered at those who first
	convoked the national assemblies and established
	the athletic games,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] amazed that they should have
	thought the prowess of men’s bodies to be deserving
	of so great bounties, while to those who had toiled in
	private for the public good and trained their own
	minds so as to be able to help also their fellow-men
	they apportioned no reward whatsoever,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] when, in
	all reason, they ought rather to have made provision
	for the latter; for if all the athletes should acquire
	twice the strength which they now possess, the rest
	of the world would be no better off; but let a single
	man attain to wisdom, and all men will reap the
	benefit who are willing to share his insight.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Yet I have not on this account lost heart nor
	chosen to abate my labours; on the contrary, believing
	that I shall have a sufficient reward in the approbation
	which my discourse will itself command, I
	have come before you to give my counsels on the
	war .against the barbarians and on concord among
	ourselves. I am, in truth, not unaware that many of

	festival at Athens. See Gardner and Jevons,
	[c dimgray]Manual of Greek Antiquities,[/c] pp. 269 ff.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]This is not quite exact (see Lysias, [c dimgray]Olympiacus[/c] 2), nor
	consistent with § 45 where he mentions contests of intellect and prizes for them. But the mild interest which these
	evoked served but to emphasize the excess of enthusiasm
	for athletics against which Isocrates here and elsewhere
	protests. [c dimgray]Cf. Antid.[/c] 250 and [c dimgray]Epist.[/c] viii. 5. The complaint
	is older than Isocrates. See Xenophanes, Fr. 19.

	those who have claimed to be sophists[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] have rushed
	upon this theme, but I hope to rise so far superior to
	them that it will seem as if no word had ever been
	spoken by my rivals upon this subject; and, at the
	same time, I have singled out as the highest kind of
	oratory[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] that which deals with the greatest affairs
	and, while best displaying the ability of those who
	speak, brings most profit to those who hear; and
	this oration is of that character. In the next place,
	the moment for action has not yet gone by, and so
	made it now futile to bring up this question; for
	then, and only then, should we cease to speak, when
	the conditions have come to an end and there is
	no longer any need to deliberate about them, or
	when we see that the discussion of them is so complete
	that there is left to others no room to improve
	upon what has been said. But so long as conditions
	go on as before, and what has been said
	about them is inadequate, is it not our duty to scan
	and study this question, the right decision of which
	will deliver us from our mutual warfare, our present
	confusion, and our greatest ills?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Furthermore, if it were possible to present the
	same subject matter in one form and in no other,
	one might have reason to think it gratuitous to weary
	one’s hearers by speaking again in the same manner
	as his predecessors; but since oratory is of such a
	nature that it is possible to discourse on the same
	subject matter in many different ways—to represent
	the great as lowly or invest the little with grandeur,

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]For the meaning of the word “sophist” see General

	since the sophists concerned themselves mainly with exemplifying
	and teaching oratory; but the sophist speaks only on
	the lecture platform; the political orator is called a “rhetor”

	to recount the things of old in a new manner or set
	forth events of recent date in an old fashion[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—it
	follows that one must not shun the subjects upon
	which others have spoken before, but must try to
	speak better than they. For the deeds of the past
	are, indeed, an inheritance common to us all; but
	the ability to make proper use of them at the appropriate
	time, to conceive the right sentiments about
	them in each instance, and to set them forth in
	finished phrase, is the peculiar gift of the wise. And
	it is my opinion that the study[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] of oratory as well as
	the other arts would make the greatest advance if
	we should admire and honour, not those who make
	the first beginnings in their crafts, but those who are

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The author of the treatise [c dimgray]On the Sublime,[/c] xxxviii, quotes
	this passage and condemns Isocrates’ “puerility” in thus
	dwelling on the power of rhetoric when leading up to his
	praise of Athens, and so arousing distrust of his sincerity.
	But the objection loses its force if Isocrates is here using
	what had become a conventionalized statement of the power
	of oratory. This it probably was. \[Plutarch\], [c dimgray]Lives of the Orators[/c]
	838 f, attributes to Isocrates the definition of
	rhetoric as the means of making “small things great and
	great things small.” A similar view is attributed to the
	rhetoricians Tisias and Gorgias in Plato, [c dimgray]Phaedr.[/c] 267 a, who are credited with “making small things appear great and
	great things small, and with presenting new things in an
	old way and old themes in a modern fashion through the
	power of speech.” [c dimgray]Cf[/c]. [c dimgray]Busiris[/c] 4 and [c dimgray]Panath.[/c] 36; also

	they themselves saw clearly the happy mean, while
	the man who knows how to speak elegantly could not
	speak simply and plainly if he chose. Now these
	people deceive no one; clearly they praise those who
	are near their own level. I, for my part, am not
	concerned with such men, but rather with those who
	will not tolerate, but will resent, any carelessness
	of phrase, and will seek to find in my speeches
	a quality which they will not discover in others.
	Addressing myself to these, I shall proceed with my
	theme, after first vaunting a little further my own
	powers. For I observe that the other orators in their
	introductions seek to conciliate their hearers and
	make excuses for the speeches which they are about
	to deliver,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] sometimes alleging that their preparation
	has been on the spur of the moment, sometimes
	urging that it is difficult to find words to match the
	greatness of their theme. But as for myself, if I
	do not speak in a manner worthy of my subject and
	of my reputation and of the time which I have spent[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—not
	merely the hours which have been devoted to
	my speech but also all the years which I have lived—I
	bid you show me no indulgence but hold me up to
	ridicule and scorn; for there is nothing of the sort
	which I do not deserve to suffer, if indeed, being no
	better than the others, I make promises so great.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So much, by way of introduction, as to my personal
	claims. But as to our public interests, the speakers
	who no sooner come before us than they inform us
	that we must compose our enmities against each
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]This is done by \[Lysias\], [c dimgray]Epitaph.[/c] 1, by Hypereides,
	[c dimgray]Epitaph[/c] 2, and by Isocrates himself, [c dimgray]Panath.[/c] 36-38.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]See General Introd. p. xxx.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]This self-confidence is something more than Isocratean vanity. It is a conscious device to enhance the greatness
	of his theme. At the beginning he is exalted by its magnitude;
	at the end, 187, he is cast down by his failure to
	measure up to it. See Havet’s interesting remarks in

	other and turn against the barbarian,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] rehearsing
	the misfortunes which have come upon us from our
	mutual warfare and the advantages which will result
	from a campaign against our natural enemy—these
	men do speak the truth, but they do not start at
	the point from which they could best bring these
	things to pass. For the Hellenes are subject, some
	to us, others to the Lacedaemonians, the polities[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	by which they govern their states having thus
	divided most of them. If any man, therefore, thinks
	that before he brings the leading states into friendly
	relations, the rest will unite in doing any good
	thing, he is all too simple and out of touch with the
	actual conditions. No, the man who does not aim
	merely to make an oratorical display, but desires to
	accomplish something as well, must seek out such
	arguments as will persuade these two states to share
	and share alike with each other, to divide the
	supremacy between them, and to wrest from the
	barbarians the advantages which at the present time
	they desire to seize for themselves at the expense of
	the Hellenes.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now our own city could easily be induced to adopt
	this policy, but at present the Lacedaemonians are
	still hard to persuade; for they have inherited the
	false doctrine that leadership is theirs by ancestral
	right. If, however, one should prove to them that
	this honour belongs to us rather than to them,
	perhaps they might give up splitting hairs about this
	question and pursue their true interests.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So, then, the other speakers also should have
	made this their starting-point and should not have
	given advice on matters about which we agree before

	instructing us on the points about which we disagree.
	I, at all events, am justified by a twofold motive in
	devoting most of my attention to these points: first
	and foremost, in order that some good may come of
	it, and that we may put an end to our mutual
	rivalries and unite in a war against the barbarian;
	and, secondly, if this is impossible, in order that I
	may show who they are that stand in the way of the
	happiness of the Hellenes, and that all may be made
	to see that even as in times past Athens justly held
	the sovereignty of the sea, so now she not unjustly
	lays claim to the hegemony.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For in the first place, if it is the most experienced
	and the most capable who in any field of action deserve
	to be honoured, it is without question our right to
	recover the hegemony which we formerly possessed;
	for no one can point to another state which so far
	excels in warfare on land as our city is superior in
	fighting battles on the sea. But, in the next place,
	if there are any who do not regard this as a fair
	basis of judgement, since the reversals of fortune are
	frequent (for sovereignty never remains in the same
	hands), and who believe that the hegemony, like any
	other prize, should be held by those who first won
	this honour, or else by those who have rendered
	the most service to the Hellenes, I think that these
	also are on our side; for the farther back into the
	past we go in our examination of both these titles
	to leadership, the farther behind shall we leave those
	who dispute our claims. For it is admitted that our
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]This claim was made good two years later when the new
	naval confederacy was formed. See General Introd. p. xxxvii.
	The Greek word “hegemony”—leadership, supremacy—
	is often used in the particular sense of acknowledged
	headship of confederated states, as here.

	city is the oldest[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and the greatest[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] in the world
	and in the eyes of all men the most renowned.
	But noble as is the foundation of our claims, the
	following grounds give us even a clearer title to
	distinction: for we did not become dwellers in this
	land by driving others out of it,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] nor by finding it uninhabited,
	nor by coming together here a motley
	horde composed of many races; but we are of a
	lineage so noble and so pure that throughout our
	history we have continued in possession of the very
	land which gave us birth, since we are sprung from
	its very soil[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and are able to address our city by
	the very names which we apply to our nearest kin;
	for we alone of all the Hellenes have the right to call
	our city at once nurse and fatherland and mother. And
	yet, if men are to have good ground for pride and make
	just claims to leadership and frequently recall their
	ancestral glories, they must show that their race boasts
	an origin as noble as that which I have described.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So great, then, are the gifts which were ours from
	the beginning and which fortune has bestowed upon
	us. But how many good things we have contributed
	to the rest of the world we could estimate to best
	advantage if we should recount the history of our
	city from the beginning and go through all her
	achievements in detail; for we should find that
	not only was she the leader in the hazards of
	war, but that the social order in general in which
	we dwell, with which we share the rights of
	citizenship and through which we are able to
	live, is almost wholly due to her. It is, however,
	necessary to single out from the number of her

	In the first place, the very ground on which we
	might disparage the story, namely that it is ancient,
	would naturally lead us to believe that the events
	actually came to pass; for because many have told
	and all have heard the story which describes them,
	it is reasonable to regard this not, to be sure, as
	recent, yet withal as worthy of our faith. In the
	next place, we are not obliged to take refuge in the
	mere fact that we have received the account and the
	report from remote times; on the contrary, we are
	able to adduce even greater proofs than this regarding
	what took place. For most of the Hellenic cities,
	in memory of our ancient services, send us each year
	the first-fruits of the harvest, and those who neglect
	to do so have often been admonished by the Pythian
	priestess to pay us our due portion of their crops
	and to observe in relation to our city the customs of
	their fathers.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] And about what, I should like to
	know, can we more surely exercise our faith than
	about matters as to which the oracle of Apollo
	speaks with authority, many of the Hellenes are
	agreed, and the words spoken long ago confirm the
	practice of to-day, while present events tally with
	the statements which have come down from the men
	of old? But apart from these considerations, if we
	waive all this and carry our inquiry back to the
	beginning, we shall find that those who first appeared
	upon the earth did not at the outset find the kind of
	life which we enjoy to-day, but that they procured
	it little by little through their own joint efforts.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	Whom, then, must we think the most likely either to
	have received this better life as a gift from the gods

	or to have hit upon it through their own search?
	Would it not be those who are admitted by all
	men to have been the first to exist, to be endowed
	with the greatest capacity for the arts, and to be
	the most devoted in the worship of the gods?
	And surely it is superfluous to attempt to show
	how high is the honour which the authors of such
	great blessings deserve; for no one could find a
	reward great enough to match the magnitude of
	their achievements.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This much, then, I have to say about that service
	to humanity which is the greatest, the earliest, and
	the most universal in its benefits. But at about the
	same time, our city, seeing the barbarians in possession
	of most of the country, while the Hellenes were
	confined within a narrow space and, because of the
	scarcity of the land, were conspiring and making
	raids against each other, and were perishing, some
	through want of daily necessities, others through
	war,—our city, I say, was not content to let these
	things be as they were, but sent out leaders to the
	several states, who, enlisting the neediest of the
	people, and placing themselves at their head, overcame
	the barbarians in war, founded many cities on
	either continent, settled colonies in all the islands,
	and saved both those who followed them and those
	who remained behind; for to the latter they left
	the home country—sufficient for their needs—and
	for the former they provided more land than they
	had owned since they embraced in their conquests
	all the territory which we Hellenes now possess.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	And so they smoothed the way for those also who in
	a later time resolved to send out colonists and imitate
	our city; for these did not have to undergo the
	perils of war in acquiring territory, but could go
	into the country marked out by us and settle there.
	And yet who can show a leadership more ancestral
	than this, which had its origin before most of the
	cities of Hellas were founded, or more serviceable than
	this, which drove the barbarians from their homes and
	advanced the Hellenes to so great prosperity?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Nor did our city, after she had played her part in
	bringing to pass the most important benefits, neglect
	what remained to be done; on the contrary she made
	it but the beginning of her benefactions to find for
	those who were in want that sustenance which men
	must have who are to provide well also for their
	other needs; but considering that an existence limited
	to this alone was not enough to make men desire to
	live, she gave such careful thought to their remaining
	wants as well that of the good things which are now
	at the service of mankind—in so far as we do not have
	them from the gods but owe them to each other—there
	is not one in which our city has had no part, and most
	of them are due to her alone. For, finding the
	Hellenes living without laws and in scattered abodes,
	some oppressed by tyrannies, others perishing through
	anarchy, she delivered them from these evils by
	taking some under her protection and by setting to
	others her own example; for she was the first to lay
	down laws and establish a polity.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] This is apparent
	from the fact that those who in the beginning brought

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The tradition is probably correct that Athens was the
	first city to set her own house in order and so extended her
	influence over Greece. The creation of a civilized state
	out of scattered villages is attributed to King Theseus. See [c dimgray]Helen[/c] 35; [c dimgray]Panath.[/c] 128 ff. In [c dimgray]Panath.[/c] 151-4 Isocrates
	maintains that certain features of the Spartan constitution

	were greatly at a loss where they should dispose of

	Now the founders of our great festivals are justly
	praised for handing down to us a custom by which,
	having proclaimed a truce[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and resolved our pending
	quarrels, we come together in one place, where, as
	we make our prayers and sacrifices in common, we
	are reminded of the kinship which exists among us
	and are made to feel more kindly towards each other
	for the future, reviving our old friendships and
	establishing new ties.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] And neither to common
	men nor to those of superior gifts is the time so
	spent idle and profitless, but in the concourse of the
	Hellenes the latter have the opportunity to display
	their prowess, the former to behold these contending
	against each other in the games; and no one lacks
	zest for the festival, but all find in it that which
	flatters their pride, the spectators when they see the
	athletes exert themselves for their benefit, the
	athletes when they reflect that all the world is come
	to gaze upon them. Since, then, the benefits which
	accrue to us from our assembling together are so
	great, here again our city has not been backward;
	for she affords the most numerous and the most
	admirable spectacles, some passing all bounds in
	outlay of money, some highly reputed for their
	artistic worth, and others excelling in both these
	regards;[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and the multitude of people who visit us

	is so great that, whatever advantage there is in our
	associating together, this also has been compassed
	by our city, Athens. Besides, it is possible to find
	with us as nowhere else the most faithful friendships
	and to enjoy the most varied social intercourse; and,
	furthermore, to see contests not alone of speed and
	strength, but of eloquence and wisdom and of all the
	other arts—and for these the greatest prizes;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] since
	in addition to those which the city herself sets
	up, she prevails upon the rest of the world also to
	offer prizes;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] for the judgements pronounced by us
	command such great approbation that all mankind
	accept them gladly. But apart from these considerations,
	while the assemblages at the other great
	festivals are brought together only at long intervals
	and are soon dispersed, our city throughout all time[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	is a festival for those who visit her.

	Philosophy,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] moreover, which has helped to discover
	and establish all these institutions, which has educated
	us for public affairs and made us gentle towards
	each other, which has distinguished between the
	misfortunes that are due to ignorance and those
	which spring from necessity, and taught us to guard
	against the former and to bear the latter nobly—philosophy,
	I say, was given to the world by our city.

	every year, whereas the Olympic and Pythian games came
	only once in four years, and the Nemean and Isthmian
	games once in two years. Festival followed upon festival
	in Athens, and Isocrates’ statement is almost literally true.

	and that by using this advantage we have risen above
	them in all other respects as well;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] she saw that in

	that in them often the wise fail and the foolish
	succeed, whereas beautiful and artistic speech is

	those who are accounted wise and ignorant present
	the strongest contrast; and she knew, furthermore,

	made manifest most of all by their speech, and that
	this has proved itself to be the surest sign of culture

	speech are not only men of power in their own cities
	but are also held in honour in other states. And so
	far has our city distanced the rest of mankind in

	for praising her conduct in war, let what I have said
	suffice for those who glory in such services. But I
	think that honour is due to our ancestors no less for
	their wars than for their other benefactions; for
	not slight, nor few, nor obscure, but many and dread
	and great, were the struggles they sustained, some
	for their own territories, some for the freedom of the
	rest of the world; for at all times, without ceasing,
	they have offered the city as a common refuge and
	as a champion to the Hellenes whenever oppressed.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	And it is for this very reason that we are sometimes
	charged with adopting a foolish policy in that we are
	accustomed to cultivate the weaker peoples[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—as
	though such charges do not support those who desire
	to sing our praises. For it was not because we failed
	to appreciate how much more advantageous great
	alliances are in point of security that we pursued this
	policy in regard to the weak; no, although we realized
	much more exactly than our rivals the consequences
	of such a course, we nevertheless preferred to stand
	by the weaker even against our interests rather than
	to unite with the stronger in oppressing others for
	our own advantage.

	The character and power of Athens may be judged
	from the appeals which sundry people have in times
	past made to us for our help. Those of recent

	Adrastus, king of Argos, was the leader of the expedition
	known in story as that of the “Seven (chiefs) against

	[c dimgray]Page number 152[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c darkmagenta][b]Panegyricus[/b][/c]
	there came to us the sons of Heracles[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and, a little
	before them, Adrastus, Talaus’s son, king of Argos.
	Adrastus, on his return from the expedition against
	Thebes where he had met with disaster and had not
	by his own efforts been able to recover the bodies of
	those who had fallen under the Cadmean fortress,
	called upon our city to lend aid in a misfortune which
	was of universal concern, and not to suffer that men
	who die in battle be left unburied nor that ancient
	custom and immemorial law[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] be brought to naught.
	The sons of Heracles, on the other hand, came fleeing
	the persecution of Eurystheus, ignoring the other
	states as not capable of succouring them in their
	distress, and looking upon our city as the only one
	great enough to make return for the benefits which
	their father had bestowed upon all mankind.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So from these facts it is easy to see that even
	at that time our city was in the position of a leader;
	for who would venture an appeal for help to those
	who were weaker than themselves, or to those who
	were subject to others, passing by those who had
	greater power, especially in matters not of personal
	but of public interest which none would be likely to
	take in hand but those who claimed to stand first
	among the Hellenes? And, in the next place, the
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Heracles had been during his life a slave to the commands
	of Eurystheus, king of Mycenae. After the death
	of Heracles and his apotheosis, his sons were driven by
	Eurystheus out of the Peloponnesus. In the course of their
	wanderings they found refuge in Athens, where Theseus,
	the king, championed their cause against their oppressor.
	Eurystheus was killed in battle by Hyllus, one of the sons
	of Heracles. See Grote, [c dimgray]Hist.[/c]i. p. 94. Thebes.” They were defeated by the Thebans and were
	not even allowed to recover their dead for burial. Adrastus
	fled to Athens and there was given refuge and aid to avenge
	himself on the Thebans. See Grote, [c dimgray]Hist[/c]. i. p. 277.

	suppliants were manifestly not disappointed in the
	hopes which caused them to take refuge with our
	ancestors; for the Athenians went to war against
	the Thebans in the cause of those who had fallen in
	the battle, and against the power of Eurystheus in
	the cause of the sons of Heracles. Taking the field
	against the Thebans, they compelled them to restore
	the dead to their kindred for burial; and when the
	Peloponnesians, led by Eurystheus, had invaded our
	territory, they marched out against them, conquered
	them in battle, and put an end to their leader’s
	insolence. And though they already commanded
	admiration for their other deeds, these exploits enhanced
	their fame still more; for they did not do
	things by halves, but so completely revolutionized
	the fortunes of either monarch that Adrastus, who
	had seen fit to throw himself on our mercy, went his
	way, having in despite of his foes won all that he had
	asked, while Eurystheus, who had expected to overpower
	us, was himself made captive and compelled
	to sue for mercy; and, although he had throughout
	all his life inflicted his orders and indignities on one
	whose nature transcended that of man, and who,
	being the son of Zeus, possessed, while still a mortal,
	the strength of a god, yet, when Eurystheus offended
	against us, he suffered so complete a reverse that he
	fell into the power of Heracles’ sons and came to a

	Peloponnese, took possession of Argos, Lacedaemon,
	and Messene, settled Sparta, and were established
	as the founders of all the blessings which the Lacedaemonians
	now enjoy. These benefits they should
	have held in grateful remembrance, and should never
	have invaded this land from which they set out and
	acquired so great prosperity, nor have placed in peril
	the city which had imperilled herself for the sons of
	Heracles, nor, while bestowing the kingship upon his
	posterity,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] have yet thought it right that the city
	which was the means of the deliverance of their race
	should be enslaved to their power. But if we have to
	leave out of account considerations of gratitude and
	fairness, and, returning to the main question, state
	the point which is most essential, assuredly it is not
	ancestral custom for immigrants to set themselves
	over the sons of the soil, or the recipients of benefits
	over their benefactors, or refugees over those who
	gave them asylum.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I can make the matter clear in yet briefer
	terms. Of all the Hellenic states, excepting our
	own, Argos and Thebes and Lacedaemon were at
	that time the greatest, as they still are to this day.
	And yet our ancestors were manifestly so superior
	to them all that on behalf of the defeated Argives
	they dictated terms to the Thebans at the moment
	of their greatest pride, and on behalf of the sons of
	Heracles they conquered the Argives and the rest
	of the Peloponnesians in battle, and delivered the
	founders and leaders of Lacedaemon out of all danger
	from Eurystheus. Therefore, as to what state was

	the first power in Hellas, I do not see how anyone
	could produce more convincing evidence.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But it seems to me fitting that I should speak also
	of the city’s achievements against the barbarians,
	the more so since the subject which I have undertaken
	is the question of who should take the lead
	against them. Now if I were to go through the list
	of all our wars, I should speak at undue length;
	therefore I shall confine myself to the most important,
	endeavouring to deal with this topic also in
	the same manner in which I have just dealt with
	the other. Let us single out, then, the races which
	have the strongest instinct for domination and the
	greatest power of aggression—the Scythians and the
	Thracians and the Persians; it so happens that these
	have all had hostile designs upon us and that against
	all these our city has fought decisive wars. And
	yet what ground will be left for our opponents if it
	be shown that those among the Hellenes who are
	powerless to obtain their rights see fit to appeal to
	us for help, and that those among the barbarians who
	purpose to enslave the Hellenes make us the first
	object of their attacks?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now, while the most celebrated of our wars was
	the one against the Persians, yet certainly our deeds
	of old offer evidence no less strong for those who
	dispute over ancestral rights. For while Hellas
	was still insignificant, our territory was invaded by
	the Thracians, led by Eumolpus, son of Poseidon,
	and by the Scythians, led by the Amazons,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] the
	daughters of Ares—not at the same time, but during

	These stood out in the Athenian mind as their first great
	struggle against the barbarians, and generally found a place beside the Persian Wars in pictures of their glorious
	past. [c dimgray]Cf[/c]. [c dimgray]Archid[/c]. 42; [c dimgray]Areop.[/c] 75; [c dimgray]Panath.[/c] 193; \[Lysias\]

	the period when both races were trying to extend
	their dominion over Europe; for though they hated
	the whole Hellenic race, they raised complaints[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	against us in particular, thinking that in this way
	they would wage war against one state only, but
	would at the same time impose their power on all
	the states of Hellas. Of a truth they were not
	successful; nay, in this conflict against our fore-fathers
	alone they were as utterly overwhelmed as
	if they had fought the whole world. How great were
	the disasters which befell them is evident; for the
	tradition respecting them would not have persisted
	for so long a time if what was then done had not
	been without parallel. At any rate, we are told
	regarding the Amazons that of all who came not
	one returned again, while those who had remained
	at home were expelled from power because of the
	disaster here; and we are told regarding the
	Thracians that, whereas at one time they dwelt
	beside us on our very borders, they withdrew so far
	from us in consequence of that expedition that in
	the spaces left between their land and ours many
	nations, races of every kind, and great cities have

	was who, in good time, trained the coming generation
	and turned the masses of the people toward
	virtue, and made of them stern foemen of the
	barbarians. For they did not slight the commonwealth,
	nor seek to profit by it as their own possession,
	nor yet neglect it as the concern of others; but
	were as careful of the public revenues as of their
	private property, yet abstained from them as men

	for himself and leave to his children the greatest

	temerity, nor did they cultivate recklessness in
	themselves, but thought it a more dreadful thing
	to be charged with dishonour by their countrymen
	than to die honourably for their country; and they

	The reason for this was that they gave heed to the
	laws to see that they should be exact and good—not
	so much the laws about private contracts as those
	which have to do with men’s daily habits of life; for
	they understood that for good and true men there
	would be no need of many written laws,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but that
	if they started with a few principles of agreement
	they would readily be of one mind as to both private
	and public affairs. So public-spirited were they
	that even in their party struggles they opposed one
	another, not to see which faction should destroy the
	other and rule over the remnant, but which should
	outstrip the other in doing something good for the
	state; and they organized their political clubs, not
	for personal advantage, but for the benefit of the
	people.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] In the same spirit they governed their
	relations with other states. They treated the
	Hellenes with consideration and not with insolence,
	regarding it as their duty to command them in the
	field but not to tyrannize over them, desiring rather
	to be addressed as leaders than as masters, and rather
	to be greeted as saviours than reviled as destroyers;
	they won the Hellenic cities to themselves by doing
	kindness instead of subverting them by force, keeping
	their word more faithfully than men now keep
	their oaths, and thinking it right to abide by their
	covenants as by the decrees of necessity; they
	exulted less in the exercise of power than they
	gloried in living with self-control, thinking it their
	duty to feel toward the weaker as they expected the

	Because they were inspired by such sentiments,
	and educated the young in such habits of conduct,
	they produced in the persons of those who fought
	against the Asiatic hordes men of so great valour
	that no one, either of the poets or of the sophists,
	has ever been able to speak in a manner worthy of
	their achievements. And I can well excuse them,
	for it is quite as difficult to praise those who have
	excelled the exploits of the rest of the world as to
	praise those who have done no good thing at all;
	for in the case of the latter the speaker has no support
	in deeds, and to describe the former there exist no
	fitting words. For what words can match the measure
	of such men, who so far surpassed the members of
	the expedition against Troy that, whereas the latter
	consumed ten years beleaguering a single city,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] they,
	in a short space of time, completely defeated the
	forces that had been collected from all Asia, and
	not only saved their own countries but liberated

	or hardships or dangers would they have shrunk so
	as to enjoy men’s praise while living—these men
	who were so ready to lay down their lives for the
	sake of the glory they would have when dead? Methinks

	brought about this war in order that men endowed

	deemed worthy of the same honours as are given to

	They first displayed their valour when Darius sent
	his troops; for when the Persians landed in Attica
	the Athenians did not wait for their allies, but, making
	the common war their private cause, they marched
	out with their own forces alone to meet an enemy
	who looked with contempt upon the whole of Hellas—a

	made as great haste as if it had been their own

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]covered twelve hundred stadia
	in marching order: so strenuously did they both
	hasten, the Lacedaemonians to share in the dangers,
	the Athenians to engage the enemy before their
	helpers should arrive. Then came the later expedition,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	which was led by Xerxes in person; he had
	left his royal residence, boldly taken command as
	general in the field, and collected about him all the
	hosts of Asia. What orator, however eager to overshoot
	the mark, has not fallen short of the truth in
	speaking of this king, who rose to such a pitch of
	arrogance that, thinking it a small task to subjugate
	Hellas, and proposing to leave a memorial such as
	would mark a more than human power, did not stop
	until he had devised and compelled the execution of
	a plan whose fame is on the lips of all mankind—a
	plan by which, having bridged the Hellespont and
	channelled Athos, he sailed his ships across the mainland,
	and marched his troops across the main?[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It was against a king who had grown so proud,
	who had carried through such mighty tasks, and who
	had made himself master of so many men, that our
	ancestors and the Lacedaemonians marched forth,
	first dividing the danger: the latter going to Thermopylae
	to oppose the land forces with a thousand[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]
	picked soldiers of their own, supported by a few of
	their allies, with the purpose of checking the Persians

	our ancestors sailed to Artemisium with sixty triremes[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	which they had manned to oppose the whole
	armada of the enemy. And they dared to do these
	things, not so much in contempt of their foes as
	in keen rivalry against each other: the Lacedaemonians
	envying our city its victory at Marathon,
	and seeking to even the score, and fearing, furthermore,
	lest our city should twice in succession be the
	instrument of saving Hellas; while our ancestors,
	on the other hand, desired above all to maintain the
	reputation they had won, and to prove to the world
	that in their former battle they had conquered
	through valour and not through fortune, and in the
	next place to incite the Hellenes to carry on the war
	with their ships, by showing that in fighting on the
	sea no less than on the land valour prevails over
	numbers.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But though they displayed equal courage, they
	did not meet with similar fortunes. The Lacedaemonians
	were utterly destroyed. Although in spirit
	they were victorious, in body they were outworn;
	for it were sacrilege to say that they were defeated,
	since not one of them deigned to leave his post.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	Our ancestors, on the other hand, met and conquered
	the advance squadron of the Persians; and when
	they heard that the enemy were masters of the pass,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]
	they sailed back home and adopted such measures
	for what remained to be done that, however many
	and however glorious had been their previous achievements,
	they outdid themselves still more in the final
	hazards of that war.

	For when all the allies were in a state of dejection,
	and the Peloponnesians were fortifying the Isthmus
	and selfishly seeking their own safety; when the
	other states had submitted to the barbarians and
	were fighting on the Persian side, save only those
	which were overlooked because of their insignificance;
	when twelve hundred ships of war were bearing
	down upon them, and an innumerable army[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] was
	on the point of invading Attica; when no light of
	deliverance could be glimpsed in any quarter, but,
	on the contrary, the Athenians had been abandoned
	by their allies and cheated of their every hope; and
	when it lay in their power not only to escape from
	their present dangers but also to enjoy the signal
	honours which the King held out to them, since he
	conceived that if he could get the support of the
	Athenian fleet he could at once become master of
	the Peloponnesus also, then our ancestors scorned to
	accept his gifts;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] nor did they give way. to anger
	against the Hellenes for having betrayed them and
	rush gladly to make terms with the barbarians;
	nay, by themselves they made ready to battle for

	natural for the weaker states to seek their security
	by every means, it was not possible for those states
	which asserted their right to stand at the head of
	Hellas to avoid the perils of war; on the contrary,
	they believed that just as it is preferable for men
	who are honourable to die nobly rather than to live
	in disgrace, so too it is better for cities which are
	illustrious to be blotted out from the sight of mankind

	It is evident that they were of this mind; for when
	they were not able to marshal themselves against
	both the land and the sea forces at once, they
	took with them the entire population, abandoned
	the city, and sailed to the neighbouring island,
	in order that they might encounter each force in
	turn.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And yet how could men be shown to be braver or
	more devoted to Hellas than our ancestors, who, to
	avoid bringing slavery upon the rest of the Hellenes,
	endured to see their city made desolate, their land
	ravaged, their sanctuaries rifled, their temples
	burned, and all the forces of the enemy closing in
	upon their own country? But in truth even this
	did not satisfy them; they were ready to give battle
	on the sea—they alone against twelve hundred ships
	of war. They were not, indeed, allowed to fight
	alone; for the Peloponnesians, put to shame by our
	courage, and thinking, moreover, that if the Athenians
	should first be destroyed, they could not themselves
	be saved from destruction, and that if the Athenians
	should succeed, their own cities would be brought
	into disrepute, they were constrained to share the
	dangers. Now the clamours that arose during the
	action, and the shoutings and the cheers—things
	which are common to all those who fight on ships—
	I see no reason why I should take time to describe;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	my task is to speak of those matters which are distinctive
	and give claim to leadership, and which
	confirm the arguments which I have already advanced.
	In short, our city was so far superior while
	she stood unharmed that even after she had been
	laid waste she contributed more ships to the battle
	for the deliverance of Hellas than all the others put

	Who then should have the hegemony, when a

	Should it not be they who distinguished themselves

	battle, and in the joint struggles of the Hellenes
	were awarded the prize of valour? Should it not be
	they who abandoned their own country to save the

	the Hellenic cities, and who later delivered them
	from the greatest disasters? Would it not be an
	outrage upon us, if, having taken the largest share

	people of Scione.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] I, however, take the view, in the
	first place, that it is no sign that we ruled badly if
	some of those who were at war with us are shown
	to have been severely disciplined, but that a much
	clearer proof that we administered the affairs of our
	allies wisely is seen in the fact that among the states
	which remained our loyal subjects not one experienced
	these disasters. In the second place, if other
	states had dealt more leniently with the same circumstances,
	they might reasonably censure us; but since
	that is not the case, and it is impossible to control
	so great a multitude of states without disciplining
	those who offend, does it not follow that we deserve
	praise because we acted harshly in the fewest possible
	cases and were yet able to hold our dominion for the
	greatest length of time?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I believe that all men are of the opinion that
	those will prove the best leaders and champions of
	the Hellenes under whom in the past those who
	yielded obedience have fared the best. Well, then,
	it will be found that under our supremacy the private
	households grew most prosperous and that the
	commonwealths also became greatest. For we were
	not jealous of the growing states,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] nor did we engender
	confusion among them by setting up conflicting
	polities side by side, in order that faction

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The Melian episode is dramatically told by Thucydides
	v. 84-116. Because the Melians refused to join the Delian
	Confederacy they were besieged and conquered by the
	Athenians, 416 b.c. The men of military age were put to
	the sword and the women and children sold into slavery.
	Five hundred Athenians were later settled there. Scione
	revolted from the Confederacy in 423 b.c. Reduced to
	subjection in 421 b.c., the people suffered the same fate as
	did the Melians later and their territory was occupied by
	Plataean refugees (Thuc. iv. 120-130). These are blots on
	the record which Isocrates can at best condone. “Even the gods are not thought to be above reproach,” he says in
	the [c dimgray]Panathenaicus[/c], 62-64, where he discusses frankly these
	sins of the Athenian democracy. Xenophon tells us that
	when the Athenians found themselves in like case with
	these conquered peoples after the disaster at Aegospotami
	they bitterly repented them of this injustice, [c dimgray]Hell.[/c] ii. 3.

	up of the spirit of the Athenian hegemony in contrast to
	that of the Spartan supremacy described in 115 ff. [c dimgray]Cf.

	might be arrayed against faction and that both
	might court our favour. On the contrary, we regarded
	harmony among our allies as the common
	boon of all, and therefore we governed all the cities
	under the same laws, deliberating about them in the
	spirit of allies, not of masters; guarding the interests
	of the whole confederacy but leaving each member
	of it free to direct its own affairs; supporting the
	people but making war on despotic powers,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] considering
	it an outrage that the many should be
	subject to the few, that those who were poorer in
	fortune but not inferior in other respects should be
	banished from the offices, that, furthermore, in a
	fatherland which belongs to all in common[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] some
	should hold the place of masters, others of aliens,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	and that men who are citizens by birth[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] should be

	It was because we had these objections, and others

	continued to live under this regime for seventy years,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]
	and, during this time, they experienced no tyrannies,
	they were free from the domination of the barbarians,
	they were untroubled by internal factions. and they

	men to be deeply grateful to us, much rather
	than to reproach us because of our system of
	colonization;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] for we sent our colonies into the
	depopulated states for the protection of their territories
	and not for our own aggrandizement. And
	here is proof of this: We had in proportion to
	the number of our citizens a very small territory,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	but a very great empire; we possessed twice as
	many ships of war as all the rest combined,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and
	these were strong enough to engage double their
	number; at the very borders of Attica lay Euboea,
	which was not only fitted by her situation to command
	the sea, but also surpassed all the islands in her
	general resources,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and Euboea lent itself more
	readily to our control than did our own country;
	besides, while we knew that both among the Hellenes
	and among the barbarians those are regarded most
	highly who have driven their neighbours from their
	homes[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and have so secured for themselves a life
	of affluence and ease, nevertheless, none of these
	considerations tempted us to wrong the people of
	the island; on the contrary, we alone of those who
	have obtained great power suffered ourselves to live
	in more straitened circumstances than those who
	were reproached with being our slaves.[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] And yet,
	had we been disposed to seek our own advantage,
	we should not, I imagine, have set our hearts on the

	in the forces which they then possessed.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And that this state of affairs was due to the valour
	of our ancestors has been clearly shown in t h e fortunes
	of our city; for the very moment when we were
	deprived of our dominion marked the beginning of a
	dominion[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] of ills for the Hellenes. In fact, after the
	disaster which befell us in the Hellespont,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] when our
	rivals took our place as leaders, the barbarians won
	a naval victory,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] became rulers of the sea, occupied
	most of the islands,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] made a landing in Laconia, took
	Cythera by storm, and sailed around the whole

	One may best comprehend how great is the reversal
	in our circumstances if he will read side by side the
	treaties[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] which were made during our leadership and

	will find that in those days we were constantly setting

	and who all but sets up his viceroys in their cities.
	For with this one exception, what else is lacking?
	Was it not he who decided the issue of t h e war, was

	complaints against each other? Do we not address
	him as “The Great King” as though we were the
	captives of his spear? Do we not in our wars against
	each other rest our hopes of salvation on him, who
	would gladly destroy both Athens and Lacedaemon?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Reflecting on these things, we may well be indignant
	at the present state of affairs, and yearn for
	our lost supremacy; and we may well blame the
	Lacedaemonians because, although in the beginning
	they entered upon the war[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] with the avowed intention[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	of freeing the Hellenes, in the end they delivered
	so many of them into bondage, and because they induced
	the Ionians to revolt from Athens, the mother
	city from which the Ionians emigrated and by whose
	influence they were often preserved from destruction,
	and then betrayed them[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] to the barbarians—those
	barbarians in despite of whom they possess their
	lands and against whom they have never ceased to
	war.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At that time the Lacedaemonians were indignant
	because we thought it right by legitimate means to
	extend our dominion over certain peoples,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Now,
	however, they feel no concern, when these peoples
	are reduced to such abject servitude that it is not
	enough that they should be forced to pay tribute and
	see their citadels occupied by their foes, but, in
	addition to these public calamities, must also in their
	own persons submit to greater indignities than those
	which are suffered in our world by purchased slaves[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c];
	for none of us is so cruel to his servants as are the
	barbarians in punishing free men. But the crowning
	misery is that they are compelled to take the field

	For these evils, who else, can we think, is to blame
	but the Lacedaemonians, seeing that they have so
	great power, yet look on with indifference while those
	who have placed themselves under the Lacedaemonian
	alliance are visited with such outrages, and
	while the barbarian builds up his own empire by
	means of the strength of the Hellenes? In former
	days, it is true, they used to expel tyrants and
	bring succour to the people, but now they have so
	far reversed their policy that they make war on
	responsible governments and aid in establishing
	absolute monarchies; they sacked and razed the
	city of Mantinea,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] after peace had been concluded;
	they seized the Cadmea[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] in Thebes; and now[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	they do not permit the very greatest of our cities to
	govern even themselves, but try to compel them to
	submit to slavery or else involve them in the greatest
	disasters? But most monstrous of all it is to see
	a people who arrogate to themselves the right of
	leadership making war every day upon the Hellenes
	and committed for all time to an alliance with the
	barbarians.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And let no one suppose that I am ill-natured,
	because I have recalled these facts to you in rather
	harsh terms, after having stated at the outset that
	I intended to speak on conciliation; for it is not
	with the intention of stigmatizing the city of the
	Lacedaemonians in the eyes of others that I have
	spoken as I have about them, but that I may induce
	the Lacedaemonians themselves, so far as it lies in
	the power of words to do so, to make an end of
	such a policy. It is not, however, possible to turn
	men from their errors, or to inspire in them the
	desire for a different course of action without first
	roundly condemning their present conduct; and a
	distinction must be made between accusation, when
	one denounces with intent to injure, and admonition,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	when one uses like words with intent to benefit;
	for the same words are not to be interpreted in the
	same way unless they are spoken in the same spirit.
	For we have reason to reproach the Lacedaemonians
	for this also, that in the interest of their own city
	they compel their neighbours to live in serfdom,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	but for the common advantage of their allies they
	refuse to bring about a similar condition, although
	it lies in their power to make up their quarrel
	with us and reduce all the barbarians to a state
	of subjection to the whole of Hellas. And yet

	because we continually impoverish our own territory

	by Tiribazus, the most effective troops of his infantry
	have been levied from these parts,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and most of his
	fleet has been brought together from Ionia; and all
	these would much more gladly make common cause
	and plunder Asia than risk their lives fighting against
	each other over trifling issues. But these things we
	take no thought to prevent; instead, we wrangle
	about the islands of the Cyclades, when we have so
	recklessly given over so many cities and such great
	forces to the barbarians. And therefore some of our
	possessions are now his, some will soon be his, and
	others are threatened by his treacherous designs.
	And he has rightly conceived an utter contempt for
	us all; for he has attained what no one of his
	ancestors ever did: Asia has been conceded both
	by us and by the Lacedaemonians to belong to the
	King; and as for the cities of the Hellenes, he has
	taken them so absolutely under his control that he
	either razes them to the ground or builds his fortresses
	within them. And all this has come about by reason
	of our own folly, not because of his power.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And yet there are those who stand in awe of the
	greatness of the King’s power and maintain that he
	is a dangerous enemy,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] dwelling at length on the
	many reversals which he has brought about in the
	affairs of the Hellenes. In my judgement, however,
	those who express such sentiments do not discourage
	but urge on the expedition; for if he is going to be
	hard to make war against when we have composed
	our differences and while he, himself, is still beset by
	dissensions, then verily we should be in utmost dread
	of that time when the conflicting interests of the
	barbarians are settled and are governed by a single
	purpose, while we continue to be, as now, hostile to

	each other. But even though these objectors do in
	fact lend support to my contention, yet, for all that,
	they are mistaken in their views about the power of
	the King; for if they could show that he had ever
	in the past prevailed over both Athens and Lacedaemon
	at once, they would have reason for attempting
	to alarm us now. But if this is not the case, and
	the truth is that when we and the Lacedaemonians
	have been in conflict he has but given support to
	one of the two sides and so rendered the achievements
	of that one side more brilliant, this is no evidence of
	his own power. For in such times of crisis small
	forces have often played a great part in turning the
	scale;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] for example, even for the people of Chios[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	I might make the claim that whichever side they
	have been inclined to support, that side has proved
	stronger on the sea. Nay, it is obviously not fair to
	estimate the power of the King from those exploits
	in which he has joined forces with the one or the
	other of us, but rather from the wars which he,
	unaided, has fought on his own behalf.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Take, first, the case of Egypt: since its revolt
	from the King, what progress has he made against
	its inhabitants? Did he not dispatch to this war[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	the most renowned of the Persians, Abrocomas and
	Tithraustes and Pharnabazus, and did not they, after
	remaining there three years and suffering more disasters
	than they inflicted, finally withdraw in such
	disgrace that the rebels are no longer content with
	their freedom, but are already trying to extend
	their dominion over the neighbouring peoples as
	well? Next, there is his campaign against Evagoras.

	Treaty[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; his is an insular power and he has already
	sustained a disaster to his fleet; he has, at present,
	for the defence of his territory only three thousand
	light-armed troops; yet, humble as is the power of
	Evagoras, the King has not the power to conquer it
	in war, but has already frittered away six years in
	the attempt; and, if we may conjecture the future
	by the past, there is much more likelihood that
	someone else will rise in revolt before Evagoras is
	reduced by the siege—so slothful is the King in his
	enterprises. Again, in the Rhodian War,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] the King
	had the good will of the allies of Lacedaemon
	because of the harshness with which they were
	governed, he availed himself of the help of our
	seamen; and at the head of his forces was Conon,
	who was the most competent of our generals, who
	possessed more than any other the confidence of the
	Hellenes, and who was the most experienced in the
	hazards of war; yet, although the King had such a
	champion to help him in the war, he suffered the
	fleet which bore the brunt of the defence of Asia to
	be bottled up for three years by only an hundred
	ships, and for fifteen months he deprived the soldiers
	of their pay; and the result would have been, had
	it depended upon the King alone, that they would
	have been disbanded more than once; but, thanks

	So no one can say that I am not fair in my use of
	instances, nor that I dwell upon the minor undertakings
	of the King and pass over the most important;
	for I have striven to forestall just such a complaint,
	and have recounted the most glorious of his exploits.
	I do not, however, forget his minor campaigns; I
	do not forget that Dercylidas,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] with a thousand
	heavy-armed troops, extended his power over Aeolis;
	that Draco[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] took possession of Atarneus, and afterwards
	collected an army of three thousand lightarmed
	men, and devastated the plains of Mysia;
	that Thimbron,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] with a force only a little larger,
	crossed over into Lydia and plundered the whole
	country; and that Agesilaus, with the help of the
	army of Cyrus, conquered almost all the territory
	this side of the Halys river.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And assuredly we have no greater reason to fear
	the army which wanders a bout[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] with the King nor the
	valour of the Persians themselves; for they were
	clearly shown by the troops who marched inland[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] with
	Cyrus to be no better than the King’s soldiers who
	live on the coast. I refrain from speaking of all the
	other battles in which the Persians were worsted,

	[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]The famous “ten thousand” led by Clearchus, a Spartan,
	were employed by Cyrus, the younger son of Dareius, against
	his brother Artaxerxes, the Persian king, 401–399. The
	death of Cyrus, due to his rashness in the very moment of
	victory, deprived the rebellion of its leader and left the Greek army stranded in the heart of Asia. Xenophon, who
	has described this expedition in the [c dimgray]Anabasis[/c], led the
	remnant of this army after many months of hardship back
	to the shore of the Black Sea. See Grote, [c dimgray]Hist[/c]. viii. pp. 303 ff.
	The expedition, though unsuccessful in its purpose, was
	regarded as a triumph of courage and a demonstration of
	the superiority of the Greeks over the Persians in warfare.
	The episode is used in [c dimgray]Phil.[/c] 90-93 with the same point as
	here.

	factions, and so were not inclined to throw themselves
	wholeheartedly into the struggle against the
	King’s brother. But after Cyrus had been killed,
	and all the people of Asia had joined forces, even
	under these favourable conditions they made such a
	disgraceful failure of the war as to leave for those
	who are in the habit of vaunting Persian valour not
	a word to say. For they had to deal with only si
	Xthousand Hellenes[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—not picked troops, but men
	who, owing to stress of circumstances, were unable
	to live in their own cities.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] These were, moreover,
	unfamiliar with the country; they had been deserted
	by their allies; they had been betrayed by those
	who made the expedition with them; they had been
	deprived of the general whom they had followed;
	and yet the Persians were so inferior to these men
	that the King, finding himself in difficult straits and
	having no confidence in the force which was under
	his own command, did not scruple to arrest the
	captains of the auxiliaries in violation of the truce,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	hoping by this lawless act to throw their army into
	confusion, and preferring to offend against the gods
	rather than join issue openly with these soldiers.
	But when he failed in this plot—for the soldiers not
	only stood together but bore their misfortune nobly,—then,
	as they set out on their journey home, he
	sent with them Tissaphernes and the Persian cavalry.

	of all the uninhabited regions of that country, and
	deeming it the best possible fortune to fall in with
	as many of the enemy as possible. Let me sum up
	the whole matter: These men did not set out to get
	plunder or to capture a town, but took the field
	against the King himself, and yet they returned in
	greater security than ambassadors who go to him
	on a friendly mission. Therefore it seems to me
	that in every quarter the Persians have clearly
	exposed their degeneracy; for along the coast of Asia
	they have been defeated in many battles, and when
	they crossed to Europe they were duly punished,
	either perishing miserably or saving their lives with
	dishonour; and to crown all, they made themselves
	objects of derision under the very walls of their
	King’s palace.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And none of these things has happened by accident,
	but all of them have been due to natural causes;
	for it is not possible for people who are reared and
	governed as are the Persians, either to have a part in
	any other form of virtue or to set up on the field of
	battle trophies of victory over their foes.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] For how
	could either an able general or a good soldier be
	produced amid such ways of life as theirs? Most of
	their population is a mob without discipline or experience
	of dangers, which has lost all stamina for war
	and has been trained more effectively for servitude
	than are the slaves in our country. Those, on the
	other hand, who stand highest in repute among them
	have never governed their lives by dictates of
	equality or of common interest or of loyalty to the
	state; on the contrary, their whole existence consists
	of insolence toward some, and servility towards
	others—a manner of life than which nothing could be

	more demoralizing to human nature. Because they
	are rich, they pamper their bodies; but because they
	are subject to one man’s power, they keep their souls
	in a state of abject and cringing fear, parading themselves
	at the door of the royal palace, prostrating
	themselves, and in every way schooling themselves
	to humility of spirit, falling on their knees before a
	mortal man, addressing him as a divinity, and thinking
	more lightly of the gods than of men. So it is
	that those of the Persians who come down to the sea,
	whom they term satraps,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] do not dishonour the training
	which they receive at home, but cling steadfastly
	to the same habits: they are faithless to their friends
	and cowardly to their foes; their lives are divided
	between servility on the one hand and arrogance on
	the other; they treat their allies with contempt and
	pay court to their enemies. For example, they
	maintained the army under Agesilaus at their own
	expense for eight months,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] but they deprived the
	soldiers who were fighting in the Persian cause of
	their pay for double that length of time; they distributed
	an hundred talents among the captors of
	Cisthene,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] but treated more outrageously than their
	prisoners of war the troops who supported them in
	the campaign against Cyprus. To put it briefly—and
	not to speak in detail but in general terms,—who
	of those that have fought against them has not
	come off with success, and who of those that have
	fallen under their power has not perished from their
	atrocities? Take the case of Conon,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] who, as commander

	seize him for punishment by death? Take,
	on the other hand, the case of Themistocles,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] who in

	Then why should we cherish the friendship of men

	were of old;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and they did this, not because they

	Again, our fathers condemned many to death[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	for defection to the Medes; in our public assemblies
	even to this day, before any other business is transacted,
	the Athenians call down curses[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] upon any
	citizen who proposes friendly overtures to the
	Persians; and, at the celebration of the Mysteries,
	the Eumolpidae and the Kerykes,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] because of our
	hatred of the Persians, give solemn warning to the
	other barbarians also, even as to men guilty of
	murder, that they are for ever banned from the sacred
	rites.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] So ingrained in our nature is our hostility to
	them that even in the matter of our stories we
	linger most fondly over those which tell of the
	Trojan and the Persian wars,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] because through them
	we learn of our enemies’ misfortunes; and you will find
	that our warfare against the barbarians has inspired our
	hymns, while that against the Hellenes has brought
	forth our dirges;[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] and that the former are sung at
	our festivals, while we recall the latter on occasions
	of sorrow. Moreover, I think that even the poetry
	of Homer has won a greater renown because he has
	nobly glorified the men who fought against the
	barbarians, and that on this account our ancestors
	determined to give his art a place of honour in our

	again, may learn by heart the enmity which stands
	from of old between us and them, and that we,
	admiring the valour of those who were in the
	war against Troy, may conceive a passion for like
	deeds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So it seems to me that the motives which summon
	us to enter upon a war against them are many indeed;
	but chief among them is the present opportunity,
	which we must not throw away; for it is disgraceful
	to neglect a chance when it is present and regret it
	when it is past. Indeed, what further advantage
	could we desire to have on our side when contemplating
	a war against the King beyond those which
	are now at hand? Are not Egypt[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and Cyprus[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	in revolt against him? Have not Phoenicia and
	Syria[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] been devastated because of the war? Has
	not Tyre, on which he set great store, been seized
	by his foes? Of the cities in Cilicia, the greater
	number are held by those who side with us and the
	rest are not difficult to acquire. Lycia[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] no Persian
	has ever subdued. Hecatomnus, the viceroy of
	Caria, has in reality been disaffected for a long time
	now,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and will openly declare himself whenever we
	wish. From Cnidus to Sinope[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] the coast of Asia is
	settled by Hellenes, and these we need not to
	persuade to go to war—all we have to do is not to
	restrain them. With such bases at our command
	for the operation of our forces, and with so widespread
	a war threatening Asia on every side, why,
	then, need we examine too closely what the outcome

	small divisions of the Hellenes, it is not hard to
	foresee what would be their plight if they should be
	forced into a war against our united forces.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But this is how the matter stands: If the barbarian
	strengthens his hold on the cities of the coast
	by stationing in them larger garrisons than he has
	there now, perhaps those of the islands which lie
	near the mainland, as, for example, Rbodes and
	Samos and Chios, might incline to his side; but if
	we get possession of them first, we may expect that
	the populations of Lydia and Phrygia and of the
	rest of the up-country will be in the power of our
	forces operating from those positions. Therefore we
	must be quick and not waste time, in order that
	we may not repeat the experience of our fathers.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	For they, because they took the field later than the
	barbarians and had to abandon some of their allies,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	were compelled to encounter great numbers with a
	small force; whereas, if they had crossed over to the
	continent in time to be first on the ground, having
	with them the whole strength of Hellas, they could
	have subdued each of the nations there in turn. For
	experience has shown that when you go to war with
	people who are gathered together from many places,
	you must not wait until they are upon you, but must
	strike while they are still scattered. Now our
	fathers, having made this mistake at the outset,
	entirely retrieved it only after engaging in the
	most perilous of struggles; but we, if we are wise,
	shall guard against it from the beginning, and endeavour
	to be the first to quarter an army in the
	region of Lydia and Ionia, knowing that the King
	holds sway over the people of the continent, not
	because they are his willing subjects, but because

	have ourselves invented more than those which

	are being put to death contrary to law in their own

	Italy has been laid waste,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] when Sicily has been
	enslaved,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] when such mighty cities have been given
	over to the barbarians,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and when the remaining
	portions of the Hellenic race are in the gravest
	peril.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I am amazed at those who hold power in our
	states,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] if they think that they have occasion to be
	proud when they have never been able either to
	propose or to conceive a remedy for a situation so
	momentous; for they ought, if they had been worthy
	of their present reputation, to have dropped all else,
	and have proposed measures and given counsel about
	our war against the barbarians. Perhaps they might
	have helped us to get something done; but even if
	they had given up before gaining their object, they
	would, at any rate, have left to us their words as
	oracles for the future. But as things are, those who
	are held in highest honour are intent on matters of
	little consequence, and have left it to us, who stand
	aloof from public life,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] to advise on matters of so
	great moment.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Nevertheless, the more faint-hearted our leading
	men happen to be, the more vigorously must the
	rest of us look to the means by which we shall deliver
	ourselves from our present discord. For as matters
	now stand, it is in vain that we make our treaties of
	peace; for we do not settle our wars, but only postpone
	them and wait for the opportune moment when
	we shall have the power to inflict some irreparable
	disaster upon each other.

	designs and pursue that course of action which will
	enable us to dwell in our several cities with greater
	security and to feel greater confidence in each other.
	What I have to say on these points is simple and
	easy: It is not possible for us to cement an enduring
	peace unless we join together in a war against the
	barbarians, nor for the Hellenes to attain to concord
	until we wrest our material advantages from one and
	the same source and wage our wars against one and
	the same enemy.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] When these conditions have been
	realized, and when we have been freed from the
	poverty which afflicts our lives—a thing that breaks
	up friendships, perverts the affections of kindred into
	enmity, and plunges the whole world into war and
	strife[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—then surely we shall enjoy a spirit of concord,
	and the good will which we shall feel towards
	each other will be genuine. For all these reasons,
	we must make it our paramount duty to transfer
	the war with all speed from our boundaries to the
	continent, since the only benefit which we can reap
	from the wars which we have waged against each
	other is by resolving that the experience which
	we have gained from them shall be employed against
	the barbarians.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But is it not well, you may perhaps ask, on
	account of the Treaty,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] to curb ourselves and not be
	over-hasty or make the expedition too soon, seeing
	that the states which have gained their freedom
	through the Treaty feel grateful toward the King,
	because they believe that it was through him that
	they gained their independence, while those states
	which have been delivered over to the barbarians
	complain very bitterly of the Lacedaemonians and
	only less bitterly of the other Hellenes who entered

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]That is, instead of warring among themselves and

	into the peace, because, in their view, they were
	forced by them into slavery? But, I reply, is it not
	our duty to annul this agreement, which has given
	birth to such a sentiment—the sentiment that the
	barbarian cares tenderly for Hellas, and stands guard
	over her peace, while among ourselves are to be
	found those who outrage and evilly entreat her? The
	crowning absurdity of all, however, is the fact that
	among the articles which are written in the agreement
	it is only the worst which we guard and
	observe. For those which guarantee the independence
	of the islands and of the cities in Europe have
	long since been broken and are dead letters on the
	pillars,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] while those which bring shame upon us and
	by which many of our allies have been given over to
	the enemy—these remain intact, and we all regard
	them as binding upon us, though we ought to have
	expunged them and not allowed them to stand a
	single day, looking upon them as commands, and not
	as compacts; for who does not know that a compact
	is something which is fair and impartial to both
	parties, while a command is something which puts one
	side at a disadvantage unjustly? On this ground
	we may justly complain of our envoys who negotiated
	this peace,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] because, although dispatched by the
	Hellenes, they made the Treaty in the interest of
	the barbarians. For they ought, no matter whether
	they took the view that each of the states concerned
	should retain its original territory, or that each should
	extend its sovereignty over all that it had acquired
	by conquest, or that we should each retain control
	over what we held when peace was declared—they
	ought, I say, to have adopted definitely some one of
	these views, applying the principle impartially to all,

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Articles of treaties were commonly inscribed on pillars

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Chiefly Antalcidas of Sparta and Tiribazus, the Persian
	satrap, negotiated the peace. Isocrates complains that the
	treaty was arbitrary—not based on any principle whatsoever.

	and on this basis to have drafted the articles of the
	Treaty. But instead of that, they assigned no
	honour whatsoever to our city or to Lacedaemon,
	while they set up the barbarian as lord of all Asia;
	as if we had gone to war for his sake, or as if the
	rule of the Persians had been long established, and
	we were only just now founding our cities—whereas
	in fact it is they who have only recently attained
	this place of honour, while Athens and Lacedaemon
	have been throughout their entire history a power
	among the Hellenes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I think, however, that I shall show still more
	clearly both the dishonour which we have suffered,
	and the advantage which the King has gained by
	putting the matter in this way: All the world
	which lies beneath the firmament being divided
	into two parts, the one called Asia, the other
	Europe, he has taken half of it by the Treaty,
	as if he were apportioning the earth with Zeus,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	and not making compacts with men. Yes, and
	he has compelled us to engrave this Treaty on
	pillars of stone and place it in our public temples[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—a
	trophy far more glorious for him than those which
	are set up on fields of battle; for the latter are for
	minor deeds and a single success, but this treaty
	stands as a memorial of the entire war and of the
	humiliation of the whole of Hellas.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	These things may well rouse our indignation and
	make us look to the means by which we shall take vengeance
	for the past and set the future right. For verily
	it is shameful for us, who in our private life think
	the barbarians are fit only to be used as household
	slaves, to permit by our public policy so many of our
	allies to be enslaved by them; and it is disgraceful

	for us, when our fathers who engaged in the Trojan
	expedition because of the rape of one woman, all
	shared so deeply in the indignation of the wronged
	that they did not stop waging war until they had laid
	in ruins the city of him who had dared to commit the
	crime,—it is disgraceful for us, I say, now that all
	Hellas is being continually outraged, to take not a
	single step to wreak a common vengeance, although
	we have it in our power to accomplish deeds as lofty
	as our dreams. For this war is the only war which
	is better than peace; it will be more like a sacred
	mission than a military expedition; and it will profit
	equally both those who crave the quiet life and those
	who are eager for war; for it will enable the former
	to reap the fruits of their own possessions in security
	and the latter to win great wealth from the possessions
	of our foes.

	You will find, if you weigh the matter carefully,
	that this undertaking is most desirable for us from
	many points of view. For against whom, pray, ought
	men to wage war who crave no aggrandizement, but
	look to the claims of justice alone? Is it not against
	those who in the past have injured Hellas, and are
	now plotting against her, and have always been so
	disposed towards us? And against whom should we
	expect men to direct their envy who, while not
	wholly lacking in courage, yet curb this feeling with
	prudence? Is it not against those who have compassed
	powers that are too great for man, and yet
	are less deserving than those who are unfortunate
	among us? And against whom should those take

	at the same time intent on their own advantage?

	Furthermore, we shall not even trouble the several

	fewer than those who will be eager to join this army.
	For who, be he young or old, is so indolent that he
	will not desire to have a part in this expedition—an

	gathered together in the cause of the liberty
	of our allies, dispatched by all Greece, and faring

	them—they who will have won the meed of honour
	in such an enterprise? For if those who made war
	against an Alexander[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and took a single city were
	accounted worthy of such praise, what encomiums
	should we expect these men to win who have conquered

	[c darkmagenta][b]ISOCRATES, Discourses 5. To Philip[/b][/c]
	[b]Philip[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The[c dimgray]Address to Philip[/c] was written in 346 b.c., shortly
	after the ten years’ war between Athens and Philip
	over the possession of Amphipolis was concluded
	by the Peace of Philocrates.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Isocrates hailed the
	peace with enthusiasm. He had been actively
	opposed to the war-party in Athens,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] believing that
	the true interests of Athens and of Philip lay in
	mutual friendship. He was, in fact, engaged in
	the composition of a discourse urging this point of
	view and arguing, somewhat paradoxically, that the
	possession of Amphipolis was equally detrimental to
	both parties to the quarrel, when the declaration of
	peace interrupted his labours. This discourse was
	never finished; and, save for the brief digest of it
	with which Isocrates opens his[c dimgray]Address to Philip[/c], was
	never published. The circumstances which inspired
	it having been happily brought to an end, he turned
	his thoughts to the greater question of how the state
	of peace might be made permanent and the curse
	of mutual warfare removed once for all from Hellas.
	He was free to indulge again his dream of pan-Hellenism.

	[m1]\ [/m][b]Philip[/b]
	[c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c] had disabused his mind of the illusion
	that any Greek state could reconcile the Greeks and
	unite them in any cause.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But the career of Philip—his
	personal force, his proved military genius, his
	Hellenic sympathies, and his declared ambition to be
	captain-general of the Greeks in a war against Persia[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—awakened
	in Isocrates the hope that the powerful
	king of Macedonia might accomplish this union and
	lead the Greeks into the promised land. That hope
	had remained unvoiced during the war with Philip;
	but now that hostilities had ceased, Isocrates addressed
	to him a call to action in this greater cause.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The[c dimgray]Address to Philip[/c] is the plea of the[c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c]
	over again, but with this great difference—Athens,
	urged to crown her glorious past with the greater
	glory of leadership in this crusade, is no longer in the
	picture.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	[b]V. To Philip[/b]
	Do not be surprised, Philip, that I am going to
	begin, not with the discourse which is to be addressed
	to you and which is presently to be brought to your
	attention, but with that which I have written about
	Amphipolis.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For I desire to say a few words, by
	way of preface, about this question, in order that I
	may make it clear to you as well as to the rest of the
	world that it was not in a moment of folly that I
	undertook to write my address to you, nor because
	I am under any misapprehension as to the infirmity[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	which now besets me, but that I was led advisedly
	and deliberately to this resolution.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For when I saw that the war in which you and
	our city had become involved over Amphipolis was
	proving the source of many evils, I endeavoured to
	express opinions regarding this city and territory
	which, so far from being the same as those entertained
	by your friends, or by the orators among us,
	were as far as possible removed from their point of
	view. For they were spurring you on to the war by
	seconding your covetousness, while I, on the contrary,
	expressed no opinion whatever on the points in
	controversy, but occupied myself with a plea which
	I conceived to be more than all others conducive to
	peace, maintaining that both you and the Athenians
	were mistaken about the real state of affairs, and

	that you were fighting in support of our interests,
	and our city in support of your power; for it was
	to your advantage, I urged, that we should possess
	the territory of Amphipolis, while it was in no
	possible way to our advantage to acquire it. Yes,
	and I so impressed my hearers by my statement
	of the case that not one of them thought of
	applauding my oratory or the finish and the purity
	of my style, as some are wont to do, but instead they
	marvelled at the truth of my arguments, and were
	convinced that only on certain conditions could you
	and the Athenians be made to cease from your contentious
	rivalry. In the first place, you, for your
	part, will have to be persuaded that the friendship
	of our city would be worth more to you than the
	revenues which you derive from Amphipolis, while
	Athens will have to learn, if she can, the lesson that
	she should avoid planting the kind of colonies[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] which
	have been the ruin, four or five times over, of those
	domiciled in them, and should seek out for colonization
	the regions which are far distant from peoples
	which have a capacity for dominion and near those
	which have been habituated to subjection—such a
	region as, for example, that in which the Lacedaemonians
	established the colony of Cyrene.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] In the
	next place, you will have to realize that by formally
	surrendering this territory to us you would in fact
	still hold it in your power, and would, besides, gain
	our good will, for you would then have as many
	hostages of ours to guarantee our friendship as we
	should send out settlers into the region of your
	influence; while someone will have to make our
	own people see that, if we got possession of Amphipolis,
	we should be compelled to maintain the same

	[m1]\ [/m]
	As I continued to say many things of this tenor,
	those who heard me were inspired with the hope
	that when my discourse should be published you and
	the Athenians would bring the war to an end, and,
	having conquered your pride, would adopt some
	policy for your mutual good. Whether indeed
	they were foolish or sensible in taking this view is
	a question for which they, and not I, may fairly be
	held to account; but in any case, while I was still
	occupied with this endeavour, you and Athens
	anticipated me by making peace before I had completed
	my discourse; and you were wise in doing
	so, for to conclude the peace, no matter how, was
	better than to continue to be oppressed by the evils
	engendered by the war. But although I was in joyful
	accord with the resolutions which were adopted
	regarding the peace, and was convinced that they
	would be beneficial, not only to us, but also to you

	from the barbarians the advantages which they now
	think it proper to get for themselves at the expense
	of the Hellenes. This was, in fact, the course which
	I had already advocated in the [c dimgray]Panegyric[/c] discourse.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Having pondered on these matters and come to
	the conclusion that there could never be found a
	subject nobler than this, of more general appeal, or
	of greater profit to us all, I was moved to write upon
	it a second time. Yet I did not fail to appreciate
	my own deficiencies; I knew that this theme called
	for a man, not of my years, but in the full bloom of
	his vigour and with natural endowments far above
	those of other men; and I realized also that it
	is difficult to deliver two discourses with tolerable
	success upon the same subject, especially when the
	one which was first published was so written that
	even my detractors imitate and admire it more than
	do those who praise it to excess. Nevertheless, disregarding
	all these difficulties, I have become so
	ambitious in my old age that I have determined by
	addressing my discourse to you at the same time to
	set an example to my disciples and make it evident
	to them that to burden our national assemblies with
	oratory and to address all the people who there
	throng together is, in reality, to address no one at
	all;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] that such speeches are quite as ineffectual as
	the legal codes and constitutions[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] drawn up by the
	sophists; and, finally, that those who desire, not to
	chatter empty nonsense, but to further some practical
	purpose, and those who think they have hit upon

	some plan for the common good, must leave it to
	others to harangue at the public festivals, but must
	themselves win over someone to champion their
	cause from among men who are capable not only
	of speech but of action and who occupy a high position
	in the world—if, that is to say, they are to
	command any attention.

	It was with this mind that I chose to address to
	you what I have to say—not that I singled you out
	to curry your favour, although in truth I would give
	much to speak acceptably to you. It was not, however,
	with this in view that I came to my decision,
	but rather because I saw that all the other men of
	high repute were living under the control of polities
	and laws,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] with no power to do anything save what
	was prescribed, and that, furthermore, they were
	sadly unequal to the enterprise which I shall propose;
	while you and you alone had been granted by fortune
	free scope both to send ambassadors to whomsoever
	you desire and to receive them from whomsoever
	you please, and to say whatever you think expedient;
	and that, besides, you, beyond any of the Hellenes,
	were possessed of both wealth and power, which are
	the only things in the world that are adapted at
	once to persuade and to compel; and these aids,
	I think, even the cause which I shall propose to
	you will need to have on its side. For I am going
	to advise you to champion the cause of concord
	among the Hellenes and of a campaign against the
	barbarian; and as persuasion will be helpful in
	dealing with the Hellenes, so compulsion will be useful
	in dealing with the barbarians. This, then, is the

	the discouragements I met with from some of my
	associates; for I think the tale will be somewhat to
	my purpose. When I disclosed to them my intention
	of sending you an address whose aim was, not to
	make a display, nor to extol the wars which you have
	carried on—for others will do this—but to attempt
	to urge you to a course of action which is more in
	keeping with your nature, and more noble and more
	profitable than any which you have hitherto elected
	to follow, they were so dismayed, fearing that because
	of my old age I had parted with my wits, that they
	ventured to take me to task—a thing which up to
	that time they had not been wont to do—insisting
	that I was applying myself to an absurd and exceedingly
	senseless undertaking. “Think of it!” they
	said.“You are about to send an address which is
	intended to offer advice to Philip, a man who, even if
	in the past he regarded himself as second to anyone
	in prudence, cannot now fail, because of the magnitude
	of his fortunes, to think that he is better able
	than all others to advise himself! More than that,
	he has about him the ablest men in Macedonia, who,
	however inexperienced they may be in other matters,
	are likely to know better than you do what is expedient
	for him. Furthermore, you will find that
	there are many Hellenes living in his country, who are
	not unknown to fame or lacking in intelligence, but
	men by sharing whose counsel he has not diminished
	his kingdom but has, on the contrary, accomplished
	deeds which match his dreams. For what is lacking
	to complete his success? Has he not converted the
	Thessalians, whose power formerly extended over
	Macedonia, into an attitude so friendly to him that
	every Thessalian has more confidence in him than in

	that not only would you and Athens be grateful to
	me for what I had said but all Hellas as well.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	My purpose in recounting all this is that if, in
	what I say at the beginning, anything strikes you as
	incredible, or impracticable, or unsuitable for you to
	carry out, you may not be prejudiced and turn away
	from the rest of my discourse, and that you may not
	repeat the experience of my friends, but may wait
	with an open mind until you hear to the end all
	that I have to say. For I think that I shall propose
	something which is in line with both your duty and
	your advantage. And yet I do not fail to realize
	what a great difference there is in persuasiveness
	between discourses which are spoken and those which
	are to be read, and that all men have assumed that
	the former are delivered on subjects which are
	important and urgent, while the latter are composed
	for display and personal gain.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] And this is a natural
	conclusion; for when a discourse is robbed of the

	repeating a table of figures,—in these circumstances
	it is natural, I think, that it should make an indifferent

	and cause it to impress you as a very indifferent
	performance; the more so since I have not adorned
	it with the rhythmic flow and manifold graces of
	style which I myself employed when I was younger[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	and taught by example to others as a means by which
	they might make their oratory more pleasing and
	at the same time more convincing. For I have now
	no longer any capacity for these things because of
	my years; it is enough for me if I can only set before
	you in a simple manner the actual facts. And I
	think it becomes you also to ignore all else and give
	your attention to the facts alone. But you will be in
	the best position to discover with accuracy whether
	there is any truth in what I say if you put aside the
	prejudices[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] which are held against the sophists and
	against speeches which are composed to be read,
	and take them up one by one in your thought and
	scrutinize them, not making it a casual task, nor one
	to be attacked in a spirit of indifference, but with the
	close reasoning and love of knowledge which it is
	common report that you also share.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] For if you will
	conduct your inquiry with these aids instead of
	relying upon the opinion of the masses, you will form
	a sounder judgement about such discourses.

	This, then, completes what I wanted to say by way
	of introduction. I shall now proceed with the
	subject in hand.

	interests, you ought to make an effort to reconcile

	for if you can bring these cities together, you will
	not find it hard to unite the others as well; for all
	the rest are under the protection of the aforesaid
	cities, and fly for refuge, when they are alarmed, to
	one or other of these powers, and they all draw upon

	have conferred upon his descendants the

	insolence, and freed Heracles’ sons from the fears
	by which they were continually beset. Because of
	these services we deserve the gratitude, not only of
	those who then were preserved from destruction,
	but also of those who are now living; for to us
	it is due both that they are alive and that they
	enjoy the blessings which are now theirs, since they
	never could have seen the light of day at all had not
	the sons of Heracles been preserved from death.

	Therefore, seeing that these cities have each and
	all shown such a spirit, no quarrel should ever have
	arisen between you and any one of them. But
	unfortunately we are all prone by nature to do wrong
	more often than right; and so it is fair to charge
	the mistakes of the past to our common weakness.
	Yet for the future you must be on your guard to
	prevent a like occurrence, and must consider what
	service you can render them which will make it
	manifest that you have acted in a manner worthy
	both of yourself and of what these cities have done.
	And the opportunity now serves you; for you would
	only be repaying the debt of gratitude which you
	owed them, but, because so much time has elapsed,
	they will credit you with being first in friendly
	offices. And it is a good thing to have the appearance
	of conferring benefits upon the greatest states
	of Hellas and at the same time to profit yourself
	no less than them. But apart from this, if anything
	unpleasant has arisen between you and any of them,
	you will wipe it out completely; for friendly acts in
	the present crisis will make you forget the wrongs
	which you have done each other in the past. Yes,
	and this also is beyond question, that all men hold
	in fondest memory those benefits which they receive

	in times of trouble. And you see how utterly
	wretched these states have become because of their
	warfare, and how like they are to men engaged
	in a personal encounter; for no one can reconcile
	the parties to a quarrel while their wrath is rising;
	but after they have punished each other badly,
	they need no mediator, but separate of their own
	accord. And that is just what I think these states

	Now perhaps someone will venture to object to
	what I have proposed, saying that I am trying to
	persuade you to set yourself to an impossible task,
	since the Argives could never be friendly to the

	Thebans, and since, in general, those who have been
	accustomed throughout their whole existence to
	press their own selfish interests can never share and
	share alike with each other. Well, I myself do not
	believe that at the time when our city was the first
	power in Hellas, or again when Lacedaemon occupied
	that position, any such result could have been accomplished,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	since the one or the other of these two cities
	could easily have blocked the attempt; but as things
	are now, I am not of the same mind regarding them.

	the same level by their misfortunes, and so I think
	that they would much prefer the mutual advantages
	which would come from a unity of purpose to the
	selfish gains which accrued from their policy in those
	days.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Furthermore, while I grant that no one else

	Peloponnesians were one and all trying to devastate
	Lacedaemon, we alone among the Hellenes formed
	an alliance[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] with the Lacedaemonians and helped
	to save them from destruction.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] So then, seeing that
	such great reversals are wont to occur, and that our
	states care nothing about their former enmities or
	about their oaths or about anything else save what
	they conceive to be expedient for themselves, and
	that expediency is the sole object to which they give
	their affections and devote all their zeal, no man,
	unless obsessed by utter folly, could fail to believe
	that now also they will show the same disposition,
	especially if you take the lead in their reconciliation,
	while selfish interests urge and present ills constrain
	them to this course. I, for my part, believe that,
	with these influences fighting on your side, everything
	will turn out as it should.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I think that you can get most light on the
	question whether these cities are inclined toward
	peace with each other or toward war, if I review,
	not merely in general terms nor yet with excessive
	detail, the principal facts in their present situation.
	And first of all, let us consider the condition of the
	Lacedaemonians.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Lacedaemonians were the leaders of the
	Hellenes,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] not long ago, on both land and sea, and
	yet they suffered so great a reversal of fortune when
	they met defeat at Leuctra that they were deprived
	of their power over the Hellenes, and lost such of
	their warriors as chose to die rather than survive

	defeat at the hands of those over whom they had
	once been masters. Furthermore, they were obliged
	to look on while all the Peloponnesians, who formerly
	had followed the lead of Lacedaemon against the
	rest of the world, united with the Thebans and
	invaded their territory; and against these the
	Lacedaemonians were compelled to risk battle, not
	in the country to save the crops, but in the heart
	of the city,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] before the very seat of their government,
	to save their wives and children—a crisis in
	which defeat meant instant destruction, and victory
	has none the more delivered them from their ills;
	nay, they are now warred upon by their neighbours[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c];
	they are distrusted by all the Peloponnesians[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c];
	they are hated by most of the Hellenes[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]; they are
	harried and plundered day and night by their own
	serfs[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]; and not a day passes that they do not have
	to take the field or fight against some force or other,
	or march to the rescue of their perishing comrades.
	But the worst of their afflictions is that they live in
	continual fear that the Thebans may patch up their
	quarrel with the Phocians[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] and, returning again,[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c]
	ring them about with still greater calamities than
	have befallen them in the past. How, then, can we
	refuse to believe that people so hard pressed would
	gladly see at the head of a movement for peace a
	man who commands confidence and has the power to
	put an end to the wars in which they are involved?

	Now as to the Argives, you will see that in some
	respects they are no better off than the Lacedaemonians,
	while in others their condition is worse;
	for they have been in a state of war with their
	neighbours[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] from the day they founded their city,
	just as have the Lacedaemonians; but there is this
	difference, that the neighbours of the Lacedaemonians
	are weaker than they, while those of the
	Argives are stronger—a condition which all would
	admit to be the greatest of misfortunes. And so
	unsuccessful are they in their warfare that hardly
	a year passes that they are not compelled to
	witness their own territory being ravaged and laid
	waste.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] But what is most deplorable of all is
	that, during the intervals when their enemies
	cease from harrying them, they themselves put
	to death the most eminent and wealthy of their
	citizens;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and they have more pleasure in doing
	this than any other people have in slaying their
	foes. The cause of their living in such disorder
	is none other than the state of war; and if you
	can put a stop to this, you will not only deliver
	them from these evils but you will cause them to
	adopt a better policy with respect to their other
	interests as well.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And as for the condition of the Thebans, surely
	you have not failed to note that also. They won
	a splendid victory[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and covered themselves with
	glory, but because they did not make good use of
	their success they are now in no better case than
	those who have suffered defeat and failure. For

	It would still remain for me to speak about our
	city, had she not come to her senses before the
	others and made peace; but now I need only say
	this: I think that she will join forces with you in
	carrying out your policy, especially if she can be
	made to see that your object is to prepare for the
	campaign against the barbarians.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	That it is not, therefore, impossible for you to bring
	these cities together, I think has become evident
	to you from what I have said. But more than that,
	I believe I can convince you by many examples
	that it will also be easy for you to do this. For if
	it can be shown that other men in the past have
	undertaken enterprises which were not, indeed,
	more noble or more righteous than that which I
	have advised, but of greater magnitude and difficulty,
	and have actually brought them to pass, what ground
	will be left to my opponents to argue that you will
	not accomplish the easier task more quickly than
	other men the harder?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Consider first the exploits of Alcibiades.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Although
	he was exiled from Athens[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and observed
	that the others who had before laboured under this
	misfortune had been cowed[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] because of the greatness
	of the city, yet he did not show the same submissive
	spirit as they; on the contrary, convinced
	that he must attempt to bring about his return by
	force, he deliberately chose to make war upon her.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]
	Now if one should attempt to speak in detail of the
	events of that time, he would find it impossible to
	recount them all exactly, and for the present occasion
	the recital would perhaps prove wearisome. But so

	great was the confusion into which he plunged not
	only Athens but Lacedaemon and all the rest of
	Hellas as well, that we, the Athenians, suffered what
	all the world knows;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] that the rest of the Hellenes
	fell upon such evil days that even now the calamities
	engendered in the several states by reason of that
	war are not yet forgotten;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and that the Lacedaemonians,
	who then appeared to be at the height
	of their fortune, are reduced to their present state
	of misfortune,—all on account of Alcibiades.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] For
	because they were persuaded by him to covet the
	sovereignty of the sea, they lost even their leadership
	on land; so that if one were to assert that they
	became subject to the dominion of their present
	ills[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] when they attempted to seize the dominion
	of the sea, he could not be convicted of falsehood.
	Alcibiades, however, after having caused these great
	calamities, was restored to his city, having won a
	great reputation, though not, indeed, enjoying the
	commendation of all.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The career of Conon,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] not many years later, is a
	counterpart to that of Alcibiades. After his defeat
	in the naval engagement in the Hellespont,[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] for
	which not he but his fellow-commanders were
	responsible, he was too chagrined to return home;
	instead he sailed to Cyprus, where he spent some
	time attending to his private interests.[c dimgray][sup]h[/sup][/c] But learning
	that Agesilaus had crossed over into Asia with

	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Isocrates does not much exaggerate the mischief he
	wrought in Greek affairs generally.

	“dominion”—[c dimgray]cf. Paneg.[/c]119, [c dimgray]Nicocl.[/c] 28, [c dimgray]Peace[/c] 101.
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]At length Alcibiades fell out with Athens’ enemies,
	and began to intrigue in her favour; and so effectively did he work that his services were recognized at home and he
	was welcomed back to take again a leading part in the
	life of Athens, 408 b.c. There appears to have been no
	open opposition to his return. The many who distrusted
	him probably thought him less dangerous at home than in exile.

	a large force[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and was ravaging the country, he was
	so dauntless of spirit that, although he possessed
	no resource whatever save his body and his wits, he
	was yet confident that he could conquer the Lacedaemonians,
	albeit they were the first power in
	Hellas on both land and sea; and, sending word to
	the generals of the Persian king, he promised that
	he would do this. What need is there to tell more
	of the story? For he collected a naval force off
	Rhodes, won a victory over the Lacedaemonians in a
	sea-fight,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] deposed them from their sovereignty, and
	set the Hellenes free.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] And not only did he rebuild
	the walls of his country,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] but he restored Athens to
	the same high repute from which she had fallen.
	And yet who could have expected that a man whose
	own fortunes had fallen so low would completely
	reverse the fortunes of Hellas, degrading some of
	the Hellenic states from places of honour and raising
	others into prominence?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Again, there is the case of Dionysius[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] (for I
	desire you to be convinced by many instances that
	the course of action to which I am urging you is an
	easy one). He was a person of small account among
	the Syracusans in birth,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] in reputation, and in all
	other respects;[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] yet, being inspired by a mad and
	unreasoning passion for monarchy, and having the
	hardihood to do anything which advanced him to
	this goal, he made himself master of Syracuse,
	conquered all the states in Sicily which were of
	Hellenic origin, and surrounded himself with a power

	Then again, Cyrus[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] (that we may take account
	of the barbarians also), notwithstanding the fact
	that as a child he was exposed by his mother on the
	public highway[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and was picked up by a Persian
	woman,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] so completely reversed his fortunes that
	he became master of all Asia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now if Alcibiades in exile, and Conon after a
	disastrous defeat, and Dionysius, a man of no repute,
	and Cyrus, with his pitiable start in life, advanced
	so far and achieved such mighty deeds, how can
	we fail to expect that you, who are sprung from such
	ancestors, who are king of Macedonia and master
	of so many peoples, will effect with ease this union
	which we have discussed?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Consider how worthy a thing it is to undertake,
	above all, deeds of such a character that if you
	succeed you will cause your own reputation to rival
	that of the foremost men of history, while if you
	fall short of your expectations you will at any rate
	win the good will of all the Hellenes—which is a
	better thing to gain than to take by force many
	Hellenic cities;[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] for achievements of the latter kind
	entail envy and hostility and much opprobrium, but
	that which I have urged entails none of these things.
	Nay, if some god were to give you the choice of

	without reserve.

	trouble in their own cities—men who look upon a
	state of peace which is for the good of all as a state
	of war upon their selfish interests. Heedless of all
	other considerations, they keep talking about your
	power, representing that it is being built up, not
	in behalf of Hellas, but against her, that you have
	for a long time been plotting against us all, and that,
	while you are giving it out that you intend to go
	to the rescue of the Messenians,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] if you can settle
	the Phocian question, you really design to subdue
	the Peloponnesus to your rule. The Thessalians,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	they say, and the Thebans, and all those who belong
	to the Amphictyony,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] stand ready to follow your
	lead; while the Argives, the Messenians, the
	Megalopolitans,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and many of the others are prepared
	to join forces with you and wipe out the
	Lacedaemonians; and if you succeed in doing this,
	you will easily be master of the rest of Hellas. By
	speaking this rubbish, by pretending to have exact
	knowledge and by speedily effecting in words the
	overthrow of the whole world, they are convincing
	many people. They convince, most of all, those
	who hunger for the same calamities as do the speech-
	makers; next, those who exercise no judgement
	about their common welfare, but, utterly obtuse in
	their own perceptions, are very grateful to men
	who pretend to feel alarm and fear in their behalf;
	and lastly, those who do not deny that you appear
	to be plotting against the Hellenes, but are of the
	opinion that the purpose with which you are charged
	is a worthy ambition.

	For these latter are so far divorced from intelligence
	that they do not realize that one may apply
	the same words in some cases to a man’s injury, in
	others to his advantage. For example, if at the
	present moment one were to say that the King of
	Asia was plotting against the Hellenes, and had
	made preparations to send an expedition against
	us, he would not be saying anything disparaging of
	him; nay, he would, on the contrary, make us think
	more highly of his courage and his worth. But if,
	on the other hand, one should bring this charge
	against one of the descendants of Heracles, who
	made himself the benefactor of all Hellas, he would
	bring upon him the greatest opprobrium. For who
	would not feel indignation and loathing if a man
	should be found to be plotting against those in
	whose behalf his ancestor elected to live a life
	of perils, and if he made no effort to preserve the
	good will which the latter had bequeathed as a
	legacy to his posterity, but, heedless of these
	examples, set his heart on reprehensible and wicked
	deeds?

	yet it is in the feelings of both these parties that
	you can best see the truth as to your own interests.

	ought not to despise the multitude nor count it a
	little thing to have the respect of the whole world;
	on the contrary, you ought then, and only then, to
	be satisfied that you enjoy a reputation which is
	good and great and worthy of yourself and of your
	forefathers and of the achievements of your line,
	when you have brought the Hellenes to feel toward
	you as you see the Lacedaemonians feel toward
	their kings,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and as your companions feel toward yourself.
	And it is not difficult for you to attain this
	if you determine to show yourself equally friendly
	to all, and cease treating some of the cities as friends
	and others as strangers, and if, furthermore, you
	fix your choice upon the kind of policy by which
	you can make yourself trusted by the Hellenes and
	feared by the barbarians.

	And do not be surprised (as I said in my letter to
	Dionysius after he had made himself master of
	Sicily) that I, who am not a general nor a public
	orator nor in any other position of authority, have
	expressed myself to you more boldly than the
	others. The fact is that nature has placed me more
	at a disadvantage than any of my fellow-citizens for
	a public career:[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] I was not given a strong enough
	voice nor sufficient assurance to enable me to deal
	with the mob, to take abuse, and bandy words with
	the men who haunt the rostrum; but, though some
	will condemn my taste in saying so, I do lay claim
	to sane judgement and good education, and I would
	count myself in comparison with others not among
	the last, but among the foremost. And that is why I
	endeavour in this way, for which my nature and powers
	are suited, to give advice to Athens and to the Hellenes
	at large and to the most distinguished among men.

	Now regarding myself, and regarding the course
	which you should take toward the Hellenes, perhaps
	no more need be said. But as to the expedition
	against Asia, we shall urge upon the cities which
	I have called upon you to reconcile that it is their
	duty to go to war with the barbarians, only when
	we see that they have ceased from discord. For
	the present, I shall address myself to you, not, however,
	with the same confidence as I had at that
	period of my life when I was writing on this same
	subject. For then I challenged my audience to
	visit their ridicule and contempt upon me if I did
	not manifestly treat the question in a way which
	was worthy of the matter in hand and of my reputation
	and of the time which I had devoted to the
	discourse.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But now I dread lest what I say may
	fall far short of every claim I then made; for, apart

	[c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c], which has enriched the other men who
	make philosophy their business,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] has left me quite
	impoverished, because I am neither willing to repeat

	the enterprise which I have proposed whatever occurs
	to me as likely to persuade you to undertake it.
	For even if I fall short in any degree, and am not

	I think that I shall at any rate present an attractive
	sketch for those who have the energy to elaborate
	the details and carry the work to completion.

	Asia.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For one must undertake nothing until he
	finds the Hellenes doing one of two things: either
	actually supporting the undertaking or according it
	their entire approval. It was this which Agesilaus,
	for all that he was looked upon as the most sagacious
	of the Lacedaemonians, disregarded, not because of
	incapacity but because of ambition. For he had two
	aims, which, though laudable, were not consistent,
	and could not be carried out at the same time, since
	he was resolved both to make war against the King
	and to restore his friends to their cities and put them
	in control of affairs.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Naturally the result of his
	efforts in behalf of his friends was that the Hellenes
	were involved in troubles and perils, and, owing to
	the confusion which arose at home, had neither the
	time nor the power to make war upon the barbarians.
	So from the mistakes of inadvertence at that time it
	is easy to draw the lesson that those who would take
	sane counsel must not begin a war against the King
	until someone has composed the quarrels of the
	Hellenes and has cured them of the madness which
	now afflicts them. And this is just what I have
	advised you to do.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	On these points no man of intelligence would
	venture to contradict me. But I think that if any
	of the others should be prompted to advise you in
	favour of the expedition against Asia, they would
	resort to a plea of this kind: that it has been the
	fortune of all who have undertaken a war against
	the King, without exception, to rise from obscurity
	to brilliant distinction, from poverty to wealth, and
	from low estate to be masters of many lands and

	cities. I, however, am not going to urge you on
	such grounds, but by the example of men who were
	looked upon as failures: I mean those who took the
	field with Cyrus and Clearchus.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Every one agrees that these won as complete a
	victory in battle over all the forces of the King as if
	they had come to blows with their womenfolk, but that
	at the very moment when they seemed to be masters
	of the field they failed of success, owing to the impetuosity
	of Cyrus. For he in his exultation rushed in
	pursuit far in advance of the others; and, being caught
	in the midst of the enemy, was killed. But the King,
	notwithstanding that his foes had suffered so severe
	a loss, felt so thorough a contempt for his own forces
	that he invited Clearchus and the other captains to
	a parley, promising to give them great gifts and to
	pay their soldiers their wages in full and to give
	them safe convoy home; then, having lured them
	by such prospects, and having assured them by the
	most solemn pledges known to the Persians, he
	seized them and put them to death, deliberately
	choosing to outrage the gods rather than risk
	a clash with our soldiers, bereft though they now
	were of Cyrus’s aid. And what challenge could
	be nobler or more convincing than this? For it
	is evident that, if it had not been for Cyrus, even
	that army would have overthrown the power of
	the King. But for you it is easy both to guard
	against the disaster which befell at that time and
	to equip yourself with an armament much stronger
	than that which defeated the forces of the King.
	How, then, since you possess both these advantages,
	can you fail to undertake this expedition with all
	confidence?

	And let no one suppose that I desire to conceal
	the fact that I have in some instances expressed
	myself in the same manner as upon a former occasion.
	For, coming to the same thoughts, I have preferred
	not to go through the effort of striving to phrase
	differently what has already been well expressed.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	It is true that if I were making an epideictic speech[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	I should try to avoid scrupulously all such repetitions;
	but now that I am urging my views upon you,
	I should have been foolish if I had spent more time on
	the style than on the subject matter, and if, furthermore,
	seeing that the other orators make free with
	my writings, I alone had abstained from what I have
	said in the past. So, then, I may perhaps be allowed
	to use what is my own, if at any time I am greatly
	pressed and find it suitable, although I would not
	now any more than in times past appropriate anything
	from the writings of other men.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	We may, then, regard these points as settled.
	But next in order I think that I should speak of the
	war-strength which will be available to you as compared
	with that which Clearchus and his followers
	had. First and most important of all, you will have
	the good will of the Hellenes if you choose to abide
	by the advice which I have given you concerning
	them; they, on the other hand, found the Hellenes
	intensely hostile because of the decarchies[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] which
	the Lacedaemonians had set up; for the Hellenes
	thought that, if Cyrus and Clearchus should succeed,
	their yoke would be heavier still, but that if the
	King conquered they would be delivered from their
	present hardships; and this is just what did happen
	to them. Besides, you will find as many soldiers at
	your service as you wish, for such is now the state of

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]This apology is curious, since Greek orators habitually

	affairs in Hellas that it is easier to get together a
	greater and stronger army from among those who
	wander in exile than from those who live under their
	own polities.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But in those days there was no body
	of professional soldiers, and so, being compelled to
	collect mercenaries from the several states, they had
	to spend more money on bounties[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] for their recruiting
	agents than on pay for the troops. And, lastly,
	if we should be inclined to make a careful review of
	the two cases and institute a comparison between you,
	who are to be at the head of the present expedition
	and to decide on every measure, and Clearchus,
	who was in charge of the enterprise of that day, we
	should find that he had never before been in command
	of any force whatever on either land or sea and yet
	attained renown from the misfortune which befell him
	on the continent of Asia; while you, on the contrary,
	have succeeded in so many and such mighty achievements
	that if I were making them the subject of
	a speech before another audience, I should do well
	to recount them, but, since I am addressing myself

	two Kings, the one against whom I am advising you
	to take the field, and the one against whom Clearchus
	made war, in order that you may know the temper
	and the power of each. In the first place, the father[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	of the present King once defeated our city[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and later the city of the Lacedaemonians,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] while this King[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]

	has never overcome anyone of the armies which have
	been violating his territory. Secondly, the former
	took the whole of Asia from the Hellenes by the
	terms of the Treaty[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; while this King is so far from
	exercising dominion over others that he is not in
	control even of the cities which were surrendered to
	him; and such is the state of affairs that there is

	whether they have learned to despise and contemn
	the power of the barbarians.

	Consider, again, the state of affairs in his empire.
	Who could hear the facts and not be spurred to war
	against him? Egypt was, it is true, in revolt[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] even
	when Cyrus made his expedition; but her people
	nevertheless were living in continual fear lest the
	King might some day lead an army in person and
	overcome the natural obstacles which, thanks to the
	Nile, their country presents, and all their military
	defences as well. But now this King has delivered
	them from that dread; for after he had brought
	together and fitted out the largest force he could
	possibly raise and marched against them, he retired
	from Egypt not only defeated, but laughed at and
	scorned as unfit either to be a king or to command
	an army. Furthermore, Cyprus and Phoenicia and
	Cilicia,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and that region from which the barbarians
	used to recruit their fleet, belonged at that time to
	the King, but now they have either revolted from him
	or are so involved in war and its attendant ills that
	none of these peoples is of any use to him; while
	to you, if you desire to make war upon him, they will
	be serviceable. And mark also that Idrieus,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] who

	hostile to the interests of the King than are those
	who are making open war against him; verily he
	would be of all men the most perverse if he did not
	desire the dissolution of that empire which outrages
	his brother,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] which made war upon himself, and which
	at all times has never ceased to plot against him in
	its desire to be master of his person and of all his
	wealth. It is through fear of these things that he
	is now constrained to pay court to the King and to
	send him much tribute every year; but if you should
	cross over to the mainland with an army, he would
	greet you with joy, in the belief that you were come
	to his relief; and you will also induce many of the
	other satraps to throw off the King’s power if you
	promise them “freedom” and scatter broadcast over
	Asia that word which, when sown among the Hellenes,
	has broken up both our empire and that of the

	I might go on and endeavour to speak at greater
	length on how you could carry on the war so as to
	triumph most quickly over the power of the King;
	but as things are, I fear that I might lay myself open
	to criticism if, having had no part in a soldier’s life,
	I should now venture to advise you, whose achievements
	in war are without parallel in number and

	the others to appear as your counsellors—would
	advise the very things which I have urged. I draw
	my inference from their actions while they lived.
	For your father, in dealing with those states which
	I am urging you to cultivate, kept on friendly terms[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	with them all. And the founder of your empire,
	although he aspired higher than did his fellow-citizens[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	and set his heart on a king’s power, was
	not minded to take the same road as others who
	set out to attain a like ambition. For they
	endeavoured to win this honour by engendering
	factions, disorder, and bloodshed in their own cities;
	he, on the other hand, held entirely aloof from
	Hellenic territory, and set his heart upon occupying
	the throne of Macedon. For he knew full well that
	the Hellenes were not accustomed to submit to the
	rule of one man, while the other races were incapable
	of ordering their lives without the control of some
	such power. And so it came about, owing to his
	unique insight in this regard, that his kingship has
	proved to be quite set apart from that of the generality
	of kings: for, because he alone among the Hellenes
	did not claim the right to rule over a people of
	kindred race, he alone was able to escape the perils
	incident to one-man power. For history discovers to
	us the fact that those among the Hellenes who have
	managed to acquire such authority have not only
	been destroyed themselves but have been blotted,
	root and branch, from the face of the earth;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] while
	he, on the contrary, lived a long and happy life
	and left his seed in possession of the same honours
	which he himself had enjoyed.

	Coming now to Heracles, all others who praise
	him harp endlessly on his valour or recount his
	labours; and not one, either of the poets or of the
	historians, will be found to have commemorated his
	other excellences—I mean those which pertain to
	the spirit. I, on the other hand, see here a field
	set apart and entirely unworked—a field not small
	nor barren, but teeming with many a theme for
	praise and with glorious deeds, yet demanding a
	speaker with ability to do them justice. If this
	subject had claimed my attention when I was
	younger, I should have found it easy to prove that
	it was more by his wisdom, his lofty ambition, and
	his justice than by his strength of body that your
	ancestor surpassed all who lived before his day. But
	approaching the subject at my present age, and seeing
	what a wealth of material there is in it to discuss,
	I have felt that my present powers were unequal to
	the task, and I have also realized that my discourse
	would run on to twice the length of that which is
	now before you to be read. For these reasons,
	then, I have refrained from touching upon his other
	exploits and have singled out one only—a story
	which is pertinent and in keeping with what I have
	said before, while being of a length best proportioned
	to the subject now in hand.

	When Heracles saw that Hellas was rife with
	wars and factions and many other afflictions, he first
	brought these troubles to an end and reconciled the
	cities with each other,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and then showed by his
	example to coming generations with whom and
	against whom it was their duty to go to war. For
	he made an expedition against Troy,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] which was

	so far did he excel in generalship those who at a
	later time waged war against this same city, that,
	while they with the combined strength of Hellas
	found it difficult to take Troy after a siege which
	lasted ten years, he, on the other hand, in less than
	as many days, and with a small expedition, easily
	took the city by storm. After this, he put to death
	to a man all the princes[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of the tribes who dwelt
	along the shores of both continents[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; and these he
	could never have destroyed had he not first conquered
	their armies. When he had done these
	things, he set up the Pillars of Heracles, as they
	are called, to be a trophy of victory over the
	barbarians, a monument to his own valour and the
	perils he had surmounted, and to mark the bounds
	of the territory of the Hellenes.

	My purpose in relating all this is that you may
	see that by my words I am exhorting you to a course
	of action which, in the light of their deeds, it is
	manifest that your ancestors chose as the noblest
	of all. Now, while all who are blessed with understanding
	ought to set before themselves the greatest
	of men as their model, and strive to become like
	him, it behoves you above all to do so. For since
	you have no need to follow alien examples but have
	before you one from your own house, have we not
	then the right to expect that you will be spurred
	on by this and inspired by the ambition to make
	yourself like the ancestor of your race? I do not
	mean that you will be able to imitate Heracles in
	all his exploits; for even among the gods there
	are some who could not do that; but in the qualities
	of the spirit, indevotion to humanity, and in
	the good will which he cherished toward the Hellenes,

	you can come close to his purposes. And it lies in
	your power, if you will heed my words, to attain
	whatever glory you yourself desire; for it is easier
	for you to rise from your present station and win
	the noblest fame than it has been to advance from
	the station which you inherited to the fame which
	is now yours.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] And mark that I am summoning
	you to an undertaking in which you will make
	expeditions, not with the barbarians against men
	who have given you no just cause, but with the
	Hellenes against those upon whom it is fitting that
	the descendants of Heracles should wage war.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And do not be surprised if throughout my speech
	I am trying to incline you to a policy of kindness
	to the Hellenes and of gentleness and humanity.
	For harshness is, I observe, grievous both to those
	who exercise it and to those upon whom it falls,
	while gentleness, whether in man or in the other
	animals, bears a good name; nay, in the case of
	the gods also we invoke as the “Heavenly Ones”
	those who bless us with good things, while to those
	who are agents of calamities and punishments we
	apply more hateful epithets; in honour of the
	former, both private persons and states erect temples
	and altars, whereas we honour the latter neither
	in our prayers nor in our sacrifices, but practise
	rites to drive away their evil presence.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Bearing
	ever in mind these truths, you should habitually
	act and strive to the end that all men shall cherish
	even more than they do now such an opinion of
	your character. Indeed, those who crave a greater
	fame than that of other men must map out in their
	thoughts a course of action which, while practicable,

	carry it into effect as opportunity presents a way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	From many considerations you may realize that
	you ought to act in this way, but especially from
	the experiences of Jason.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For he, without having
	achieved anything comparable to what you have
	done, won the highest renown, not from what he
	did, but from what he said; for he kept talking as
	if he intended to cross over to the continent and
	make war upon the King. Now since Jason by use
	of words alone advanced himself so far, what opinion
	must we expect the world will have of you if you
	actually do this thing; above all, if you undertake
	to conquer the whole empire of the King, or, at any
	rate, to wrest from it a vast extent of territory and
	sever from it—to use a current phrase— “Asia from
	Cilicia to Sinope”[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; and if, furthermore, you undertake
	to establish cities in this region, and to settle
	in permanent abodes those who now, for lack of the
	daily necessities of life, are wandering from place
	to place and committing outrages upon whomsoever
	they encounter?[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] If we do not stop these men
	from banding together, by providing sufficient
	livelihood for them, they will grow before we know
	it into so great a multitude as to be a terror no less
	to the Hellenes than to the barbarians. But we
	pay no heed to them; nay, we shut our eyes to the
	fact that a terrible menace which threatens us all
	alike is waxing day by day. It is therefore the duty
	of a man who is high-minded, who is a lover of
	Hellas, who has a broader vision than the rest of
	the world, to employ these bands in a war against

	the barbarians, to strip from that empire all the
	territory which I defined a moment ago, to deliver
	these homeless wanderers from the ills by which
	they are afflicted and which they inflict upon others,
	to collect them into cities, and with these cities to
	fix the boundary of Hellas, making of them buffer
	states to shield us all. For by doing this, you will
	not only make them prosperous, but you will put
	us all on a footing of security. If, however, you
	do not succeed in these objects, this much you will
	at any rate easily accomplish,—the liberation of the

	serviceable in times of danger, but have to send and
	get all these from us,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] we have gone so far in our
	passion to injure ourselves that, whereas it lies in
	our power to possess the wealth of the barbarians in
	security and peace, we continue to wage war upon
	each other over trifles,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and we actually help to
	reduce to subjection those who revolt[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] from the
	authority of the King, and sometimes, unwittingly,
	we ally ourselves with our hereditary foes[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and seek
	to destroy those who are of our own race.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Therefore, since the others are so lacking in spirit,
	I think it is opportune for you to head the war against
	the King; and, while it is only natural for the other
	descendants of Heracles, and for men who are under
	the bonds of their polities and laws, to cleave fondly
	to that state in which they happen to dwell, it is
	your privilege, as one who has been blessed with
	untrammelled freedom,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] to consider all Hellas your

	as ready to brave perils for her sake as for the things
	about which you are personally most concerned.

	Perhaps there are those—men capable of nothing
	else but criticism—who will venture to rebuke me
	because I have chosen to challenge you to the task
	of leading the expedition against the barbarians and
	of taking Hellas under your care, while I have passed
	over my own city. Well, if I were trying to present
	this matter to any others before having broached it

	yoke—I should confess my error. In truth,
	however, it will be found that I turned to Athens first
	of all and endeavoured to win her over to this cause
	with all the earnestness of which my nature is capable,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	but when I perceived that she cared less for what I
	said than for the ravings of the platform orators,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	I gave her up, although I did not abandon my efforts.
	Wherefore I might justly be praised on every hand,
	because throughout my whole life I have constantly
	employed such powers as I possess in warring on the
	barbarians, in condemning those who opposed my
	plan, and in striving to arouse to action whoever I
	think will best be able to benefit the Hellenes in any
	way or to rob the barbarians of their present prosperity.
	Consequently, I am now addressing myself
	to you, although I am not unaware that when I am
	proposing this course many will look at it askance,
	but that when you are actually carrying it out all will
	rejoice in it; for no one has had any part in what
	I have proposed, but when the benefits from it shall
	have been realized in fact, everyone without fail
	will look to have his portion.

	Consider also what a disgrace it is to sit idly by
	and see Asia flourishing more than Europe and the
	barbarians enjoying a greater prosperity[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] than the
	Hellenes; and, what is more, to see those who derive
	their power from Cyrus, who as a child was cast out
	by his mother on the public highway, addressed by
	the title of “The Great King,” while the descendants
	of Heracles, who because of his virtue was exalted by

	Rest assured that I should never have attempted

	you will win a name of surpassing greatness and
	glory. Bear in mind that while we all possess bodies

	and good report and memory which keeps pace with

	that wealth and positions of power often fall into
	the hands of our foes, whereas the good will of our

	have mentioned are possessions to which none can
	fall heir but our own children, and they alone. I

	could not, therefore, respect myself if I failed to
	advance these motives in urging you to make this
	expedition and wage war and brave its perils.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You will best resolve upon this question if you feel
	that you are summoned to this task, not by my words
	only, but by your forefathers, by the cowardice of the
	Persians, and by all who have won great fame and
	attained the rank of demigods because of their
	campaigns against the barbarians, and, most of all,
	by the present opportunity, which finds you in the
	possession of greater power than has any of those
	who dwell in Europe, and finds him against whom
	you are to make war more cordially hated and
	despised by the world at large than was ever any
	king before him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I should have given much to be able to blend into
	one all the speeches I have delivered on this question;
	for the present discourse would then appear more
	worthy of its theme. But, as things are, it devolves
	upon you to search out and consider, from all my
	speeches, the arguments which bear upon and urge
	you to this war; for so you will best resolve upon
	the matter.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now I am not unaware that many of the Hellenes
	look upon the King’s power as invincible.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Yet one
	may well marvel at them if they really believe that
	the power which was subdued to the will of a mere
	barbarian—an ill-bred[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] barbarian at that—and collected
	in the cause of slavery, could not be scattered
	by a man of the blood of Hellas, of ripe experience
	in warfare, in the cause of freedom—and that too
	although they know that while it is in all cases
	difficult to construct a thing, to destroy it is, comparatively,
	an easy task.

	Bear in mind that the men whom the world most
	admires and honours are those who unite in themselves
	the abilities of the statesman and the general.
	When, therefore, you see the renown which even in
	a single city is bestowed on men who possess these
	gifts, what manner of eulogies must you expect to
	hear spoken of you, when among all the Hellenes
	you shall stand forth as a statesman who has worked
	for the good of Hellas, and as a general who has
	overthrown the barbarians? I, for my part, think
	that this will set a limit to human endeavour; for
	no other man will ever be able to do deeds greater
	than these, because among the Hellenes there will
	never be again so great an enterprise as that of
	leading us forward out of our innumerable wars into
	a spirit of concord; nor, among the barbarians, is
	it likely that so great a power will ever be built
	up again if once you shatter that which they now
	possess. Therefore, in generations yet to come, no
	one, no matter how surpassing his genius, will ever
	be in a position to do so great a thing. Yes, and
	speaking of those who lived before your time, I could
	show that their deeds are excelled by the things
	which you have even now accomplished, in no specious
	sense but in very truth; for since you have overthrown
	more nations than any of the Hellenes has
	ever taken cities, it would not be hard for me to
	prove, comparing you with each of them in turn,
	that you have accomplished greater things than they.
	But I have deliberately abstained from this mode of
	comparison, and for two reasons: because some
	writers employ it in season and out of season, and
	also because I am unwilling to represent those whom

	the world regards as demigods as of less worth than
	men who are now living.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Ponder well the fact (to touch upon examples from
	the distant past) that while no man, whether poet or
	writer of prose, would applaud the wealth of Tantalus,
	or the rule of Pelops, or the power of Eurystheus,
	all the world, with one accord, would praise¬—
	next to the unrivalled excellence of Heracles and the
	goodness of Theseus—the men who marched against
	Troy and all others who have proved to be like them.
	And yet we know that the bravest and most famous
	of them held their sway in little villages and petty
	islands; nevertheless they left behind them a name
	which rivals that of the gods and is renowned throughout
	the world. For all the world loves, not those
	who have acquired the greatest power for themselves
	alone, but those who have shown themselves to be
	the greatest benefactors of Hellas.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And you will observe that this is the opinion
	which men hold, not of these heroes only, but of all
	mankind. Thus, no one would praise our city either
	because she was once mistress of the sea, or because
	she extorted such huge sums of money from her
	allies and carried them up into the Acropolis,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] nor
	yet, surely, because she obtained power over many
	cities—power to devastate them, or aggrandize
	them, or manage them according to her pleasure
	(for all these things it was possible for her to do);
	no, all these things have been the source of many
	complaints against her, while because of the battle
	of Marathon, the naval battle at Salamis, and most
	of all because her citizens abandoned their own

	in the field of speech I might prove least irksome
	to my hearers. Indeed, I believe that even your
	past achievements would never have reached such
	magnitude had not one of the gods helped you to
	succeed; and I believe he did so, not that you
	might spend your whole life warring upon the
	barbarians in Europe alone, but that, having been
	trained and having gained experience and come to
	know your own powers in these campaigns, you
	might set your heart upon the course which I have

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The disastrous battle of Leuctra in 371 b.c., followed
	up by three Theban invasions of the Peloponnesus,
	had reduced Sparta to a state of extreme anxiety.
	In 369 b.c., on the first of these invasions, Epaminondas
	had actually entered Sparta itself.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] In addition
	he had called back the fugitive Helots and Messenians,
	and with them had founded the new city of
	Messene.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	During the course of the later invasions, Corinth
	and some of the lesser allies of Sparta became
	restive. They bore the brunt of the Theban inroads,
	and got nothing for their pains. Therefore in 366
	b.c. they made overtures of peace to Thebes. One
	of the conditions which Thebes imposed was that
	the newly colonized city of Messene be recognized
	as independent.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Disposed to comply with this
	demand, the allied states, headed by the Corinthians,
	met in congress at Sparta to urge this course.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The Messenians and the Helots had revolted against
	Sparta during the earthquake of 464 b.c. Messene was
	destroyed and the Messenians who remained on the ground
	were enslaved. See Diodorus xv. 66.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]This was in reality one of the terms of the peace of
	Pelopidas, secured by that Theban statesman in 367 b.c.

	[b]Archidamus[/b]
	Isocrates has chosen for the setting of this speech
	the dramatic moment when Corinth has just presented
	the views of the allies. Archidamus III., son
	of the ruling king Agesilaus, rises in the assembly
	which had met to debate the question of war or
	peace with Thebes, and exhorts the Spartans to die
	rather than abandon Messene, their rightful and
	hereditary possession.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This stirring plea, admirably simulating the martial
	ardour of Spartan youth, was a remarkable performance
	for Isocrates in his ninetieth year. Among
	the ancient critics it excited general admiration
	as a masterpiece of finished composition, and
	animated style,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and as a model of patriotic sentiment
	for citizens the world over.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The purpose for which it was composed is a matter
	of conjecture. The out-and-out pro-Spartan sentiment
	which runs through it does not accord with
	the severe strictures upon Spartan policy which
	Isocrates elsewhere makes. The speech has, there-fore,
	been explained both in ancient and modern
	times as a rhetorical exercise. This it probably
	was, in the sense that the author sought to enter
	sympathetically into Archidamus’s point of view.
	He liked and admired the young prince, as appears
	from his letter to Archidamus, written some years
	later, as well as from the attractive portrait which
	the oration itself presents. It was no doubt written
	partly as a personal compliment and sent to Archidamus
	to make such use of as he saw fit, although
	it is improbable, if not impossible, that it was composed
	for him to deliver. But it was also intended,

	certainly, as a political document, setting forth in
	round terms, not only the feeling of the Spartans
	at this time, but also the Athenian hatred of Thebes
	and sympathy with Sparta which were accentuated
	during the Theban supremacy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In view of the allusions to the peace congress of
	that year, the oration may probably be dated about

	Doubtless some of you are astonished that I, who
	heretofore have observed the customs[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of the state
	more faithfully, I dare say, than any other of my
	generation, have now so completely changed that
	I have come forward, in spite of my youth, to offer
	counsel regarding a subject which even our elders
	hesitate to discuss. The fact is that if any of those
	who are accustomed to address you had spoken in a
	manner worthy of the state, I should strictly have held
	my peace; but now, since I see that they are either
	seconding the demands of the enemy, or opposing
	them but feebly, or have kept silent altogether, I
	have risen to set forth my own views on this subject,
	feeling that it would be disgraceful if by keeping
	the place appropriate to my years I should allow the
	state to pass measures unworthy of itself.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Moreover, I think that although on other matters
	it may be proper for men of my age to keep silent,
	yet on the question of war it is fitting that they
	most of all should give counsel who will also have
	the greatest part in the dangers, especially since the
	power to judge of what ought to be done is an
	endowment common to all of us. For if it were
	established that older men always know what is

	best, while the younger are never correct in their
	views, it would be right to exclude us from giving
	counsel; but since it is not by the number of our
	years that we differ in wisdom from one another,
	but by our natural endowments and by our cultivation
	of them, why should you not make trial of both
	the young and the old, in order that you may be
	in a position to choose from all courses which are
	proposed that which is the most expedient? I am
	amazed at those who think that we are fit to command
	ships of war and to lead armies in the field,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] where
	bad judgement on our part would involve the state
	in many grave disasters, and yet do not think that
	we ought to express our views on matters which
	you are about to decide, wherein if we proved to be
	right we should benefit you all, while if, on the
	other hand, we failed of your assent we should ourselves
	perhaps suffer in reputation, but should not
	in any way impair the commonwealth.

	It is not, I assure you, because I am ambitious to

	about these things, but because I want to urge you
	not to reject any time of life, but to seek among all
	ages for the man who can offer good advice on the
	problems which now confront us; for never since we
	have dwelt in Sparta has any war or any peril come
	upon us in which so much has been at stake as in
	this question which we are now assembled to discuss.
	For while in times past we fought that we might
	have dominion over the other states, now we must
	fight that we ourselves may not be forced to do their
	bidding—which is proof of a free spirit, to preserve
	which no hardship on earth is too great to endure,

	Although I have never been fond of oratory, having
	in fact always thought that those who cultivate the
	power of speech are somewhat lacking in capacity
	for action,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] yet at the moment there is nothing I
	should value more than the ability to speak as I

	First, I think that I ought to explain to you in
	what way we acquired Messene, and for what reasons
	you settled in the Peloponnesus—you who from of
	old are Dorians. And the reason why I shall go
	back to remote times is that you may understand why
	your enemies are trying to rob you of this country,
	which you acquired, no less than Lacedaemon itself,
	with a just title.

	When Heracles had put off this life and from being
	mortal became a god, his sons at first went on divers
	wanderings and faced many perils because of the
	power of their enemies;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] but after the death of
	Eurystheus they fixed their habitation among the
	Dorians. In the third generation thereafter they
	came to Delphi, desiring to consult the oracle about
	certain matters. Apollo, however, made them no
	answer to the questions which they asked, but merely
	bade them seek the country of their fathers. Searching
	into the meaning of the oracle, they found, first,
	that Argos belonged to them by right of their being
	next of kin, for after the death of Eurystheus they
	were the sole survivors of Perseus’ line;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] next, that

	had vanished from among men,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] he gave the

	been robbed of the cattle from Erytheia[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] by Neleus
	and all his sons except Nestor, had taken the country
	captive and slain the offenders, but had committed

	his half-brother Hippocoön and by Hippocoön’s sons.
	See Apollodorus iii. 10. 5.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Heracles slew Hippocoön and his twenty sons and
	restored Tyndareus.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Castor was slain during a foray in Messene. His
	brother, Polydeuces, who according to most accounts was
	a son of Zeus by Leda, while Castor was a son of Tyndareus
	by Leda, refused to accept immortality unless it was shared
	by his brother. Zeus, therefore, granted that the two
	brothers dwell, on alternate days, among the gods and among men. According to others, both were sons of Zeus.
	Hence Isocrates can refer to their kinship with Heracles,

	so far in their wickedness that they plotted against
	and slew Cresphontes, albeit he was the founder of
	their state, the sovereign of their land, a descendant
	of Heracles, and once the leader of their armies.
	His sons, however, escaped the perils which confronted

	statement makes it evident to all that there is no

	and because we fought and conquered those who held
	it; and Messene we received from the same people,
	in the same way, and by taking the advice of the
	same oracle. To be sure, if we are in a mood not to
	defend our title to anything, not even if they demand
	that we abandon Sparta itself, it is idle to
	be concerned about Messene; but if not one of you
	would consent to live if torn from the fatherland,

	Then again you are doubtless well aware that
	possessions, whether private or public, when they
	have remained for a long time in the hands of their

	before the Persians acquired their kingdom[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and
	became masters of the continent, in fact before a
	number of the Hellenic cities were even founded.
	And yet notwithstanding that we hold these titles,
	the Thebans would on the one hand restore Asia as
	his ancestral right to the barbarian,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] who has not yet
	held sway over it for two hundred years, while on
	the other hand they would rob us of Messene, which
	we have held for more than twice that length of

	Perhaps Isocrates is speaking loosely, or perhaps he follows
	another source than Pausanias, who is almost our sole

	Were they restoring those who are truly Messenians,
	they would still be acting unjustly, but at least they
	would have a more plausible pretext for wronging us;
	but as the case stands, it is the Helots whom they are
	trying to settle on our frontier,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] so that the worst
	fate which threatens us is not that we shall be robbed
	of our land contrary to justice, but that we shall see
	our slaves made masters of it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You will perceive still more clearly from what
	follows both that we are now dealt with most
	unfairly and that in the past we held Messene
	justly. For in the many wars which have befallen
	us we have before this at times been forced to make
	peace when we were in much worse case than our
	foes.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] But, although our treaties were concluded
	under circumstances in which it was impossible for us
	to seek any advantage, yet, while there were other
	matters about which differences arose, neither the
	Great King nor the city of Athens ever charged us
	with having acquired Messene unjustly. And yet
	how could we find a more thoroughgoing judgement
	on the justice of our case than this, which was
	rendered by our enemies and made at a time when
	we were beset with misfortunes?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	That oracle, moreover, which all would acknowledge
	to be the most ancient and the most widely
	accepted and the most trustworthy in existence,
	recognized Messene as ours, not only at the time
	when it commanded us to receive the country as a
	gift from the sons of Cresphontes and to go to the
	aid of the wronged, but also later, when the war

	dragged on and both sides sent delegations to
	Delphi, the Messenians appealing for deliverance
	and we inquiring how we could most speedily make
	ourselves masters of their city, the god gave them
	no answer, thus showing that their appeal was unjust,
	while to us he revealed both what sacrifices we
	should perform and to whom we should send for aid.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And yet how could anyone furnish testimony
	more significant or clearer than this? For it has
	been shown, first of all (since nothing prevents our
	restating these points briefly), that we received
	the country from its rightful owners; secondly,
	that we took it by war, precisely as most of the
	cities in those days were founded; further, that
	we drove out those who had grievously sinned
	against the children of Heracles—men who by right
	should have been banished from the sight of all
	mankind; and, finally, it has been shown that the
	length of our tenure, the judgement of our enemies,
	and the oracles of Apollo all confirm our right to
	the possession of Messene. Anyone of these facts
	is enough to refute the assertions of those who
	presume to allege against us either that we now
	refuse to conclude peace because of a desire for
	aggrandizement, or that we then made war on the
	Messenians because we coveted what was not our
	own. I might perhaps say more than this about
	our acquisition of Messene, but I consider what I
	have already said to be sufficient.

	I observe that the wars of the past have in the end
	been decided, not in accordance with the strongest
	forces, but in accordance with justice; and that,
	in general, the life of man is destroyed by vice and
	preserved by virtue. Therefore those should not

	fight better than your foes. According to their
	proposal, on the other hand, you would withdraw
	at once from Messene, and, having first committed
	this wrong against yourselves, you would perhaps
	fail to secure both what is expedient and what is
	just — and everything else which you expect to
	gain. For as yet it is by no means evident that if
	we do as we are bidden we shall henceforth enjoy
	a lasting peace. For I think you are not unaware
	that all men are wont to discuss just terms with
	those who defend their rights, while in the case of
	those who are over-ready to do what they are commanded
	they keep adding more and more to the
	conditions which at first they intended to impose;
	and thus it happens that men of a warlike temper
	obtain a more satisfactory peace than those who
	too readily come to terms.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But lest I should seem to dwell too long on this
	point, I shall abandon all such considerations and
	turn at once to the simplest of my proofs. If no
	people, after meeting with misfortune, ever recovered
	themselves or mastered their enemies, then we
	cannot reasonably hope to win victory in battle;
	but if on many occasions it has happened that
	the stronger power has been vanquished by the
	weaker, and that the besiegers have been destroyed
	by those confined within the walls, what wonder
	if our own circumstances likewise should undergo a
	change?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now in the case of Sparta I can cite no instance
	of this kind, for in times past no nation stronger
	than ourselves ever invaded our territory;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but in
	the case of other states there are many such examples
	which one might use, and especially is this true of

	as a result of dictating to others they lost repute
	with the Hellenes, while by defending themselves

	Similar to this was the career of Amyntas, king

	he at first proposed to quit the country and
	save his life, but hearing someone praise the remark
	made to Dionysius, and, like Dionysius, repenting
	of his decision, Amyntas seized a small fortified

	Seeing, then, that such great reversals have taken
	place, he is a very foolish person who thinks that
	they will fail to occur in our case; nay, we must
	endure for the present and be of good courage with
	regard to the future, knowing that states repair such
	disasters by the aid of good government and experience
	in warfare; and on this point no one would
	dare contradict me when I say that we have greater
	experience in military matters than any other people,
	and that government as it ought to be exists among
	us alone. With these two advantages on our side,
	we cannot fail to prove more successful in our undertakings
	than those who have paid but slight attention
	to either government or war.

	There are those who condemn war and dwell on

	good or bad, but rather it is the use we make of
	circumstances and opportunities which in either

	prosperous should set their hearts on peace, for in
	a state of peace they can preserve their present
	condition for the greatest length of time; those,

	change in their fortunes. But we, I fear, will be
	seen to have pursued exactly the opposite course;
	for when we might have lived at ease, we made
	more wars than were necessary, but now, when we
	have no choice but to risk battle, we desire tranquillity
	and deliberate about our own security.
	And yet those who wish to be free ought to shun
	a peace whose terms are dictated by the enemy as
	being not far removed from slavery, and should make
	treaties only when they have defeated their adversaries,
	or when they have made their forces equal
	to those of the enemy; for the kind of peace which
	each side will obtain will be decided by the manner
	in which they conclude the war.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Bearing these facts in mind, you must not rashly
	commit yourselves to shameful terms, nor let it
	appear that you are more remiss in your deliberations
	about your country than about the rest of the
	world. Let me recall to your minds that formerly,
	if a single Lacedaemonian gave aid to one of our
	allied cities when it was pressed by siege, all men
	would concede that its deliverance was due to
	him. Now the older among you could name the
	greater number of these men, but I, too, can recount
	the most illustrious of them: Pedaritus,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] sailing to
	Chios, saved that city; Brasidas entered Amphipolis
	and, having rallied about him a few of those
	who were under siege, defeated the besiegers[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	in battle in spite of their numbers; Gylippus, by
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Harmost of Chios in 412 b.c., who was successful against
	the Athenians for a time, but was defeated and slain in
	412 b.c. See Thucyd. viii. 55. 3.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Brasidas entered Amphipolis in 422 b.c., and in command
	of 150 hoplites sallied out against Cleon, the Athenian general.
	The greater part of the besieged forces was commanded by
	Clearidas. Brasidas lost his life in the engagement which
	followed, and became after his death a local hero at Amphipolis.
	See Thucyd. v. 8-11.

	against a long season of misfortune? Who would
	not censure us if, while the Messenians withstood
	siege for twenty years in order to retain Messene,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	we should so quickly withdraw from it under a
	treaty and should take no thought of our forefathers,
	but should allow ourselves to be persuaded by words
	to throw away this territory which they acquired
	by dint of struggles and wars?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There are those, however, who care for none of
	these things, but, overlooking all considerations of
	shame, counsel you to follow a course which will bring
	disgrace upon the state. And so anxious are they to
	persuade you to give up Messene that they have
	dared to dwell on the weakness of Sparta and the
	strength of the enemy, and now they challenge us
	who oppose them to say from what quarter we expect
	reinforcements to come, seeing that we exhort you
	to make war.

	For my part, I consider that the strongest and
	surest ally we can have is just dealing, for it is
	probable that the favour of the gods will be with
	those who deal justly—that is, if we may judge the
	future by the past; and in addition to this ally are
	good government and sober habits of life, and a willingness
	to battle to the death against the enemy, and
	the conviction that nothing is so much to be dreaded
	as the reproaches of our fellow-citizens—qualities
	which we possess in larger measure than any other
	people in existence. With these allies I would far
	rather go to war than with multitudes of soldiers,
	for I know that those of our people who first came
	to this country did not prevail over their adversaries
	through numbers, but through the virtues which I

	stand in fear of our enemies because they are
	many, but should much rather take courage when
	we see that we ourselves have borne up under our
	misfortunes as no other people have ever done,
	and that we still remain faithful to the customs and
	ways of life which we established here in the very
	beginning, while the rest of the Hellenes are not able
	to stand even their good fortune, but have become
	completely demoralized, some of them seizing the
	cities of their allies,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] others opposing them in this;
	some disputing with their neighbours about territory,
	others, again, indulging their envy of one another[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	But if I must also speak of aid from the outside,
	I think that many will be disposed to assist us.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] For
	I know, in the first place, that the Athenians, although

	describing Thebes and especially her allies in the
	Peloponnesus.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]See note [c dimgray]a,[/c] p. 352. Xenophon, [c dimgray]Hell.[/c] vii. 1. 32, says that
	the Thebans and Eleans were no less pleased at the defeat of
	their allies, the Arcadians, in the “tearless” battle of 367 b.c.
	than were the Lacedaemonians.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]For Athens see [c dimgray]Peace[/c] 105 and [c dimgray]Philip[/c] 44. Among the
	states in Peloponnesus, Phlius, Heraea, and Orchomenus
	in Arcadia were still true to Sparta. (Xenophon, [c dimgray]Hell.[/c] vii. 2. 1, vi. 5. 22, and vi. 5. 11.) The reference is to Dionysius
	the younger, who began to reign 367–366 b.c. His father
	had given aid to Sparta on various occasions. See Underhill’s
	note on Xenophon, [c dimgray]Hell[/c]. v. 1. 28 (Oxford edition).
	Nectanebos (378–364 b.c.) was king of Egypt at this time.
	Egypt generally supported those who fought against the
	Persians, and now the Theban enemies of Sparta were in
	league with Persia. As to the dynasts of Asia see [c dimgray]Paneg.[/c]
	162 and [c dimgray]Philip[/c] 103. Probably such powerful rulers as
	Mausolus of Caria, who revolted from Persia in 362 b.c., are

	However, so far am I from complying with the
	enemy’s demands that, if none of these hopes should
	be realized and we should fail to obtain help from
	any quarter, but on the contrary some of the Hellenes
	should wrong us and the rest should look on with
	indifference—even so I should not alter my opinion;
	but I would undergo all the hazards which spring
	from war before I would agree to these terms. For
	I should be equally chagrined in either case—if we
	charged our forefathers with having deprived the
	Messenians of their land unjustly, or if, although
	insisting that they acquired it rightly and honourably,
	we made any concession regarding this territory
	contrary to our just rights. Nay, we must follow
	neither course, but must consider how we may carry
	on the war in a manner worthy of Spartans, and
	not prove those who are wont to eulogize our state
	to be liars, but so acquit ourselves that they shall
	seem to have told less than the truth about us.

	hemmed in on every side and be no longer

	to proclaim it boldly; for that which I shall propose

	on the other hand, who are willing and able to fight
	must remain behind, abandon the city and all our
	possessions except what we can carry with us, and
	having seized some stronghold which will be the
	most secure and the most advantageous for carrying
	on the war, harry and plunder our enemies both
	by land and by sea until they cease from laying

	having no other duty but that of war, would resemble
	a mercenary force, but in point of native valour
	and of disciplined habits would be like no army
	that could be levied in all the world—an army,
	moreover, which would have no fixed government,
	but would be able to bivouac in the open fields and
	to range the country at will, readily making itself
	neighbour to any people at its pleasure, and regarding
	every place which offered advantages for waging
	war as its fatherland? For my part, I believe that
	if this proposal were merely put in words and
	scattered broadcast among the Hellenes, our enemies
	would be thrown into utter confusion; and still
	more would this be so if we were put to the necessity
	of carrying it into effect. For what must we suppose
	their feelings will be when they themselves
	suffer injury, but are powerless to inflict injury upon
	us; when they see their own cities reduced to a state
	of siege, while we shall have taken such measures
	that our own city cannot henceforth experience
	a like calamity; and when, furthermore, they perceive
	that it is easy for us to procure food both from
	our existing stores and from the spoils of war, but
	difficult for them, inasmuch as it is one thing to
	provide for an army such as ours and another to
	feed the crowds in cities? But bitterest of all will
	it be for them when they learn that the members
	of our households have all along been living in
	comfort and plenty, whereas they will see their own
	people destitute every day of the necessities of life,
	and will not be able even to alleviate their distress,
	but if they till the soil, they will lose both crop and
	seed, and if they allow it to lie unworked, they will
	be unable to hold out any time at all.

	But perhaps, you will object, they will join forces
	and with their united armies will follow us up and
	prevent us from doing them harm. Yet what better
	thing could we wish than to find close at hand,
	drawn up in line of battle and encamped against us
	face to face on the same difficult ground, an undisciplined
	and motley rabble, serving under many
	leaders? For there would be need of no great
	effort on our part; no, we should quickly force them
	to give battle, choosing the moment propitious for
	ourselves and not for them.

	But the remainder of the day would fail me if I
	undertook to set forth the advantages we should
	gain by such a course. This much, at any rate, is
	clear to all—that we have been superior to all the
	Hellenes, not because of the size of our city or the
	number of its inhabitants,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but because the government
	which we have established is like a military
	camp, well administered and rendering willing obedience
	to its officers.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] If, then, we shall create in reality
	that which it has profited us to imitate, there can
	be no doubt that we shall easily overcome our foes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	We know, moreover, that those who became the
	founders of this city entered the Peloponnesus with

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Sparta was about six miles in circumference. The

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The whole life of a Spartan youth was supervised by
	military officers of one sort or another. Those over twenty
	years of age ate at a common table, or military mess. War
	was the first and only duty of a Spartan citizen, and obedience
	more important even than life.

	I should not so earnestly exhort you to carry on
	the war if I did not see that the peace resulting from
	my proposals will be honourable and enduring, while
	that which would result from the counsel of certain
	men among you will not only be disgraceful, but
	will last no time at all. For if we permit the Helots
	to settle on our borders and allow Messene to
	flourish undisturbed, who does not know that we
	shall be involved in constant turmoils and dangers
	all our lives? Therefore, those who talk about
	“security” are blind to the fact that they
	are providing us with peace for a few days only,
	while contriving a state of war which will never
	end.

	I should like to ask these men in what cause

	cause enough when the enemy make demands that
	are contrary to justice, when they cut off a portion
	of our territory, when they free our slaves and settle
	them in the land which our fathers bequeathed to
	us, yes, and not only rob us of our possessions but
	in addition to all our other miseries involve us in
	disgrace? For my part, I think that in such a
	cause as this we ought to endure, not only war, but
	even exile and death; for it is far better to end
	our lives in the possession of the high reputation
	which we now enjoy than to go on living with the
	infamy which we shall bring upon ourselves if we
	do what we are commanded to do. In a word, if
	I may speak without reserve, it is preferable for us

	to suffer annihilation, rather than derision, at the
	hands of our foes. For men who have lived in such
	high repute and in such pride of spirit must do one
	of two things—either be first among the Hellenes,
	or perish utterly, having done no ignominious deed
	but having brought their lives to an honourable close.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Reflecting upon these things, we must not be
	faint of heart, nor follow the judgements of our
	allies, whom in former times we claimed the right
	to lead, but, having duly weighed the matter for
	ourselves, we should choose, not what is easiest for
	them, but what will be in keeping with Lacedaemon
	and with our achievements in the past. For not
	every people can adopt the same measures in the
	same situation, but each must follow the principles
	which from the very first they have made the foundation
	of their lives. No one, for example, would
	reproach Epidaurians or Corinthians or Phliasians
	if they thought of nothing else than to escape
	destruction and save their own lives; we men of
	Lacedaemon, however, cannot seek our deliverance
	at all costs, but if to “safety” we cannot add
	“with honour,” then for us death with good repute
	is preferable; for those who lay claim to valour
	must make it the supreme object of their lives
	never to be found doing a shameful thing. But
	the cowardice of states is made manifest in deliberations
	like these no less than in the perils of
	war; for the greatest part of what takes place
	on the battle-field is due to fortune, but what is
	resolved upon here is a token of our very spirit.
	Wherefore we should strive for success in the
	measures to be adopted here with an emulation no
	less keen than we show in the lists of war.

	I marvel at those who are willing to die for their
	personal glory, but have not the same feeling for the
	glory of the state, for which we may well suffer
	anything whatsoever to avoid bringing shame upon
	our city, nor should we permit it to abandon the post
	in which it was established by our forefathers. It
	is true that many difficulties and dangers beset us;
	these we must avoid, but first and foremost we
	should be careful that we are never found doing any
	cowardly deed or making any unjust concessions to
	the foe; for it would be shameful if we, who once[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	were thought worthy to rule the Hellenes, should be
	seen carrying out their commands, and should fall
	so far below our forefathers that, while they were
	willing to die in order that they might dictate to
	others,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] we would not dare to hazard a battle in order
	that we might prevent others from dictating to us.

	We may well be ashamed when we think of the
	Olympian and the other national assemblies, where
	every one of us used to be more envied and more
	admired than the athletes who carry off victories in
	the games. But who would dare attend them now,
	when instead of being honoured he would be scorned,
	when instead of being sought out by all because of
	his valour, he would be conspicuous among all for
	his cowardice, and when, more than all this, he would
	see our slaves bringing from the land which our
	fathers bequeathed to us first-fruits of the harvest
	and sacrifices greater than our own, and would hear

	empire (378 b.c.).

	but now have made a treaty with their masters on
	terms of equality? How keenly every one of us
	would smart under these insults no man alive could
	set forth in words.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	These are the things about which we must take
	counsel, and we must not wait to indulge our resentment
	until that will no longer avail us, but must
	consider now how we may prevent such a disaster.
	For it is disgraceful that we, who in former times
	would not allow even free men the right of equal
	speech, are now openly tolerating licence of speech
	on the part of slaves.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For thus we shall give ground
	for the suspicion that in time past we have been
	nothing at all but idle boasters, that by nature we
	are no different from the rest of mankind, and that
	the sternness and dignity of manner which we
	cultivate is not natural, but a mere pose. Let us,
	therefore, give no such occasion to those who are
	wont to speak ill of us, but let us endeavour to
	confute their words by patterning our actions after
	those of our forefathers.

	Remember the men who at Dipaea[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] fought against
	the Arcadians, of whom we are told that, albeit they
	stood arrayed with but a single line of soldiery, they
	raised a trophy over thousands upon thousands; remember
	the three hundred who at Thyrea[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] defeated

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Others translate ἰσηγορίας as [c dimgray]political equality[/c] and
	understand τῶν ἐλευθέρων to refer to the allies of Sparta.
	But the passage is probably better taken as referring to
	the military harshness of the Spartans toward any and all
	with whom they came in contact, as, for instance, when
	Astyochus started to beat a free man for speaking too
	freely (see Thucyd. viii. 84).
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]In 471 b.c. See Herodotus ix. 35, and Pausanias viii. 8. 4.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]In 542 b.c. See Herodotus i. 82, and Pausanias ii. 38. 5.
	Isocrates confuses two contests, one earlier, where three
	hundred Argives fought against three hundred Spartans,
	one later, where both sides matched their full forces.

	be gained, not by repose, but by struggle, and these
	we should strive to win, sparing neither our bodies
	nor our lives nor anything else which we possess.
	For if we succeed, and are able to raise our city again

	remembering that it is a nobler thing to exchange a
	mortal body for immortal glory, and to purchase
	with a life which at best we shall retain for only
	a few years a fame which will abide with our descendants
	throughout all the ages[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—a far nobler
	course than to cling greedily to a little span of life
	and cover ourselves with great disgrace!

	But I think that you would most of all be aroused
	to prosecute the war if in imagination you could see
	your parents and your children standing, as it were,
	beside you, the former exhorting you not to disgrace
	the name of Sparta, nor the laws under which we
	were reared, nor the memory of the battles fought in
	their time; the latter demanding the restoration of
	the country which their forefathers bequeathed to
	them, together with the dominion and the leadership
	among the Hellenes which we ourselves received
	from our fathers. Not a word could we say in answer;
	never could we deny the justice of either plea.

	I do not know what more I need to add, save only
	this much—that while numberless wars and dangers
	have fallen to the lot of Sparta, the enemy have
	never yet raised a trophy over us when a king from
	my house was our leader. And prudent men, when
	they have leaders under whom they win success in
	their battles, should also give heed to them, in preference
	to all others, when they give counsel regarding
	impending wars.

	[b]On the Peace[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	It is questionable whether the title [c dimgray]On the Peace[/c], which is used in most modern editions, following the two manuscripts Γ and Ε[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
	is more appropriate to the matter of the discourse than the title [c dimgray]On the Confederacy[/c],[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] which is given in the other manuscripts and in Aristotle’s [c dimgray]Rhetoric[/c] iii. 17.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In any case, the discourse is only in a very limited sense an argument for a particular treaty of peace to end the wretched Social War which Athens was waging against her former allies, the Chians, the Coans, the Rhodians, and the Byzantines, who had withdrawn from the Second Athenian Confederacy and were now fighting for their independence. The Athenians were themselves weary of the war, and Isocrates seems to assume that some sort of peace is to be patched up.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Eubulus, leader of the peace party, had apparently already drawn up the articles
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]See General Introd. p. xlvi, Isocrates, Vol. I., L.C.L.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]‘Ο ΣΥΜΜΑΧΙΚΟΣ. The word συμμαχία means any alliance, no matter how limited or temporary, but denoted also a voluntary federation of allied states under a recognized leadership, such as the Confederacy of Delos, formed in 478 b.c., and the Second Confederacy or League, formed in 378 b.c., both under the leadership of Athens.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]In fact, he speaks as if the peace were already an accomplished fact. See 15.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 2[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]On the Peace[/b]
	of a treaty[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] conceding independence to the recalcitrant allies, and it only remained for the General Assembly to act upon them. But Isocrates is not interested in this proposed pact; it does not go to the root of the matter, being merely a palliative—an
	expedient to end one war only to make room for another.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] He is seeking a permanent cure for the troubles into which Athens has fallen, and he finds it only in a radical reversal of her policy of aggression.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] He proposes, therefore, that she make a lasting peace “not only with Chios, Cos, Rhodes, and Byzantium, but with all the world.”[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] This is a high-sounding phrase, but he means nothing less. Athens must come to her senses, throw away her dream of empire, and recognize once for all the right of each Hellenic state to be free and independent. Not only that, she must be alert and active in the championship of that right and, by the exercise of moral supremacy, win back the good will of the Hellenes and so regain the leadership which she lost by the exercise of military power.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In urging this, he has in mind the position which Athens once held among the Hellenic states; he is thinking of the Confederacy of Delos as it was in the beginning—a voluntary federation of free states with a common purpose and a chosen leadership—before
	Athens turned it into an empire maintained by force. It is the ideal of the [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c] over again[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]—an ideal more precious now in contrast with the evils of imperialism more clearly seen and more vividly set forth in the light of recent history. When

	he wrote the [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c], he had before him the disasters which overtook, first, the Athenian Empire and, after it, the Empire of Sparta. Since that time, the Theban supremacy, gained at the battle of Leuctra in 371 b.c., had taken the same “mad”
	course and suffered a similar fate.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Moreover, Athens had in the meantime repeated the mistakes which brought about the dissolution of the Confederacy of Delos. The Second Confederacy, formed in 378 b.c., had started out with bright hopes. It seemed that the lessons of former experience had been laid to heart, but these were soon forgotten. The same coercive measures were taken to extend and hold together the League.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Chares, in particular, the leading general of Athens, who had no mind for moral scruples, bullied the allies and treated them as subject states;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and orators—above all Aristophon—were
	not lacking at home to dangle before the people the alluring baits of empire. The results were the revolt of the allies, the Social War, and the state of demoralization in Athens which is described in this discourse and in the [c dimgray]Areopagiticus[/c].
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The hopeful exuberance of the [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c] is absent from the discourse [c dimgray]On the Peace[/c]. There is no suggestion here of a union of all Hellas in a crusade against Persia, although that dream is still in the background of the author’s mind.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Twenty-five years of disconcerting experience have had their effect. It is enough for Isocrates now to urge Athens to set her own house in order and to take the lead in a consistent policy

	of peace, resorting to war only to defend the principle that the states of Hellas have the right to be free. For this purpose it is, he thinks, a waste of time to talk of a new treaty of peace. Athens is already pledged to a treaty[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] which guarantees the independence of the Greek cities and forbids aggression. This part of the Treaty has been and is a dead letter:[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] all that is necessary is to put it into effect. Nothing more clearly than this shows the change in the mind of Isocrates. The covenants of the “Peace of Antalcidas,” which are denounced with bitter eloquence in the [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c],[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] are here termed the “most just and the most expedient”[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] which can be expected under the present circumstances.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This discourse was probably written in 355 b.c. Chios, Cos, Rhodes, and Byzantium revolted from the Athenian Confederacy in 357. The peace which conceded their independence was signed in 355. The internal evidence of the oration indicates that it was composed while the negotiations were pending.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The author of the Greek “hypothesis” states that when the question of peace or war was brought before the General Assembly, Isocrates arose and gave this address. This he infers from the speech itself, which has the form and the atmosphere appropriate to such an occasion. It is certain, however, that Isocrates did not deliver it, and it is likely that he composed it as a political pamphlet to be circulated among a reading public.[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]

	All those who come before you on this platform are accustomed to assert that the subjects upon which they are themselves about to advise you are most important and most worthy of serious consideration by the state.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Nevertheless, if it was ever appropriate to preface the discussion of any other subject with such words, it seems to me fitting also to begin with them in speaking upon the subject now before us. For we are assembled here to deliberate about War and Peace, which exercise the greatest power over the life of man, and regarding which those who are correctly advised must of necessity fare better than the rest of the world. Such, then, is the magnitude of the question which we have come together to decide.

	I observe, however, that you do not hear with equal favour the speakers who address you, but that, while you give your attention to some, in the case of others you do not even suffer their voice to be heard.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] And it is not surprising that you do this; for in the past you have formed the habit of driving all the orators from the platform[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] except those who

	Indeed, you have caused the orators to practise and study, not what will be advantageous to the state, but how they may discourse in a manner pleasing to you. And it is to this kind of discourse that the majority of them have resorted also at the present time, since it has become plain to all that you will be better pleased with those who summon you to war than with those who counsel peace; for the former put into our minds the expectation both of regaining our possessions in the several states and of recovering the power which we formerly enjoyed,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] while the latter hold forth no such hope, insisting rather that we must have peace and not crave great possessions contrary to justice,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] but be content with those we have[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]—and that for the great majority of

	disciplined recalcitrant confederate states by expelling their
	citizens and settling Athenians on their lands. Such settlements
	were called cleruchies. When Athens formed the new naval confederacy in 378 b.c. it was expressly stipulated by her allies and agreed to by Athens that such abuse of power should not be repeated. But the jingoistic orators advocated nothing less than the restoration of the former empire with all its powers and practices.

	mankind is of all things the most difficult. For we are so dependent on our hopes and so insatiate in seizing what seems to be our advantage that not even those who possess the greatest fortunes are willing to rest satisfied with them but are always grasping after more and so risking the loss of what they have. Wherefore we may well be anxious lest on the present occasion also we may be subject to this madness. For some of us appear to me to be over-zealously bent on war, as though having heard, not from haphazard counsellors, but from the gods, that we are destined to succeed in all our campaigns and to prevail easily over our foes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But people of intelligence, when dealing with matters about which they have knowledge, ought not to take counsel—for this is superfluous—but to act as men who are already resolved what to do, whereas, in dealing with matters about which they take counsel, they ought not to think that they have exact knowledge of what the result will be, but to be minded towards these contingencies as men who indeed exercise their best judgement, but are not sure what the future may hold in store.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You, however, do neither the one thing nor the other, but are in the utmost confusion of mind. For you have come together as if it were your business to select the best course from all that are proposed; nevertheless, as though you had clear knowledge of what must be done, you are not willing to listen to any except those who speak for your pleasure. And yet, if you really desired to find out what is advantageous to the state, you ought to give your attention
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]This somewhat wordy passage in which the orator
	becomes the philosopher reflects a fundamental idea of his
	pedagogy: There can be no exact science or knowledge
	of what to do in all contingencies and relations of life; the
	best that we can do is to develop sound, not infallible, judgement in dealing with them. See General Introd. p. xxvii, Isocrates, Vol. I., L.C.L., and [c dimgray]Antid[/c]. 184, note.

	more to those who oppose your views than to those who seek to gratify you, knowing well that of the orators who come before you here, those who say
	what you desire are able to delude you easily—since what is spoken to win favour clouds your vision of what is best—whereas those who advise you without regard to your pleasure can affect you in no such way, since they could not convert you to their way of thinking until they have first made clear what is for your advantage. But, apart from these considerations, how can men wisely pass judgement on the past or take counsel for the future unless they examine and compare the arguments of opposing speakers, themselves giving an unbiased hearing[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] to both sides?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I marvel that the older men no longer recall and that the younger have not been told by anyone that the orators who exhort us to cling fast to peace have never caused us to suffer any misfortune whatsoever, whereas those who lightly espouse war have already plunged us into many great disasters. However, we have no memory for these facts but are always ready, without in the least advancing our own welfare, to man triremes, to levy war-taxes, and to lend aid to the campaigns of others or wage war against them, as chance may determine, as if imperilling the interests, not of our own, but of a foreign state. And the cause of this condition of affairs is that, although you ought to be as much concerned about the business of the commonwealth as about your own, you do not feel the same interest in the one as in the other; on the contrary, whenever you take counsel regarding your private business you seek out as counsellors men who are your superiors in intelligence, but whenever you deliberate on the

So that we may well marvel that anyone can expect a state which employs such counsellors to advance to better things.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I know that it is hazardous to oppose your views[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and that, although this is a free government, there exists no ‘freedom of speech’[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] except that which is enjoyed in this Assembly by the most reckless orators, who care nothing for your welfare, and in the theatre by the comic poets.[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] And, what is most outrageous of all, you show greater favour to those who publish the failings of Athens to the rest of the Hellenes than you show even to those who benefit the city, while you are as ill-disposed to those who rebuke and admonish you[c dimgray][sup]h[/sup][/c] as you are to men who work injury to the state.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The private morals of men like Eubulus, Callistratus
	(see Theopompus in Athenaeus iv. 166 e), and Philocrates
	(see Aeschines, [c dimgray]On the Embassy[/c] 52) apparently left much to
	be desired.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Aristotle ([c dimgray]Constitution of Athens[/c] 34) states that when,
	after the battle of Arginusae, 406 b.c., the Spartans made
	overtures of peace the demagogue Cleophon came before
	the Assembly drunk and prevented the Athenians from
	accepting the terms. With this paragraph should be compared
	[c dimgray]Antid.[/c] 316 and note.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The reference is particularly to Eubulus, who caused
	to be set aside a portion of the public revenues (the “surplus”
	mentioned in 82) as a “theoric” fund to be distributed to
	the people at the public festivals.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]See 128, note.
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c][c dimgray]Cf[/c]. Socrates in Plato, [c dimgray]Apology[/c] 31 e: “No man in the world can preserve his life if he honestly opposes himself to you or to any other people and attempts to prevent many unjust and lawless things from being done by the state.”
	[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]The pride of Athens. See Herod, v. 78; Lur. [c dimgray]Hippol[/c]. 422.
	[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c]The poets of the old comedy exercised an incredible degree of licence in ridiculing everything, divine or human, particularly the foibles of the state. These comedies were given at the festival of Dionysus, when many visitors from other states were in Athens. Aristophanes himself says ([c dimgray]Acharnians[/c] 500 ff.) that he was attacked by Cleon for
	“abusing Athens in the presence of strangers.”

	Nevertheless, in spite of these conditions, I shall not desist from what I had in mind to say. For I have come before you, not to seek your favour nor to solicit your votes, but to make known the views I hold, first, regarding the proposals which have been put before you by the Prytaneis,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and, second, regarding the other interests of the state; for no good will come of the resolutions which have now been made regarding the peace[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] unless we are well advised also with regard to what remains to be done.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I maintain, then, that we should make peace, not only with the Chians, the Rhodians, the Byzantines and the Coans, but with all mankind, and that we should adopt, not the covenants of peace which certain parties[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] have recently drawn up, but those which we have entered into[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] with the king of Persia and with the Lacedaemonians, which ordain that the Hellenes be independent, that the alien garrisons be removed from the several states, and that each people retain its own territory. For we shall not find terms of peace more just than these nor more expedient for our city.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But if I leave off speaking at this point, I know that I shall appear to put Athens at a disadvantage, if, that is to say, the Thebans are to retain possession of Thespiae and Plataeae[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and the other cities[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] which they have seized contrary to their oaths,[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] while we are to retire, under no compulsion to do so, from the territory which we now hold.

	you will only listen to me and give me your attention to the end, I believe that you will all impute extreme folly and madness to those who think that injustice is advantageous and who would hold in subjection by force the cities of others, failing to reckon with the disasters which result from such a policy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	On this point indeed I shall attempt to instruct you throughout my entire speech. But first let us discuss the question of peace and consider what we should desire for ourselves at the present juncture. For if we define this clearly and intelligently, we shall take better counsel in the light of this principle regarding our other interests[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] as well. Let me ask, then, whether we should be satisfied if we could dwell in our city secure from danger, if we could be provided more abundantly with the necessities of life, if we could be of one mind amongst ourselves, and if we could enjoy the high esteem of the Hellenes. I, for my part, hold that, with these blessings assured us, Athens would be completely happy. Now it is the war[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] which has robbed us of all the good things which I have mentioned; for it has made us poorer;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] it has compelled many of us to endure perils; it has given us a bad name among the Hellenes; and it has in every way overwhelmed us with misfortune. But if we make peace and demean ourselves as our common covenants[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] command us to do, then we shall dwell in our city in great security, delivered from wars and perils and the turmoil in which we are now involved amongst ourselves,

	and we shall advance day by day in prosperity, relieved of paying war-taxes, of fitting out triremes, and of discharging the other burdens[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] which are imposed by war, without fear cultivating our lands and sailing the seas and engaging in those other occupations which now, because of the war, have entirely come to an end.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Nay, we shall see our city enjoying twice the revenues[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] which she now receives, and thronged with merchants and foreigners and resident aliens,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] by whom she is now deserted.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And, what is most important of all, we shall have all mankind as our allies—allies who will not have been forced, but rather persuaded, to join with us, who will not welcome our friendship because of our power when we are secure only to abandon us when we are in peril,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] but who will be disposed towards us as those should be who are in very truth allies and friends.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Furthermore, what we are now unable to obtain through war and great outlay of money we shall readily secure for ourselves through peaceful embassies. For do not think that Cersobleptes will wage war with us over the Chersonese, or Philip[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] over Amphipolis,[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] when they see that we do not covet any of the possessions of other peoples. It is true that as things are now they have good reason to be afraid to make Athens a near neighbour to their dominions; for they see that we are not content with what we have but are always reaching out for more.

	If, however, we change our ways and gain a better reputation, they will not only withdraw from our territory but will give us besides territory of their own. For it will be to their advantage to cherish and support the power of Athens and so be secure in the possession of their own kingdoms.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And, mark you, it will be possible for us to cut off from the region of Thrace enough land[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] so that we shall not only have abundance ourselves but shall also be able to furnish adequate means of subsistence to those of the Hellenes who are in need and, because of their poverty, are now wandering from place to place.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] For where Athenodorus[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and Callistratus,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] the one a private, the other an exile, have been able to found cities, surely we could gain possession of many such places if we so desired. And those who claim the right to stand at the head of the Hellenes ought to become leaders of such enterprises much rather than of war and of hireling armies,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] which at the present time are the objects of our ambition.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now as to the promises held out by the ambassadors,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] what I have said is enough, although one might perhaps add many things to what I have said. But I think we should not go forth from this assembly, having merely adopted resolutions in favour of the peace, without also taking counsel how we shall keep it, and not do what we are in the habit of doing—namely,

	disorders after a short interval of time[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—and how we shall devise, not merely a postponement, but some means of permanent deliverance from our present ills. But no such thing can come to pass until you are persuaded that tranquillity is more advantageous and more profitable than meddlesomeness,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] justice than injustice, and attention to one’s own affairs than covetousness of the possessions of others.

	This is a theme on which none of the orators has ever made bold to address you. I, however, shall devote most of my discourse to this very subject. For I observe that happiness is to be found in these ways of life and not in those which we now follow. But anyone who attempts to discourse on a subject out of the common and who desires to bring about a change in your opinions must needs touch upon many matters and speak somewhat at length, now reminding, now rebuking, now commending, and again counselling you. For hardly with all these aids can you be led to a better way of thinking.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For the matter stands thus. It seems to me that, while all men crave their advantage and desire to be better off than the rest, they do not all know the kind of conduct which leads to this end but differ from each other in judgement, some possessing a judgement which is sound and capable of hitting the right course of action,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] others one which completely misses their true advantage.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] And this is the very

	thing which has happened to our city; for we think that, if we sail the sea with many triremes and compel the various states to pay contributions[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and send representatives[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] to Athens, we have accomplished something to the purpose. But in fact, we have been completely misled as to the truth; for of the hopes which we cherished not one has been fulfilled; on the contrary, we have reaped from them hatreds and wars and great expense. And this was to be expected; for in former times as the result of such meddlesomeness we were placed in the utmost peril,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] while as the result of keeping our city in the path of justice and of giving aid to the oppressed and of not coveting the possessions of others we were given the hegemony by the willing consent of the Hellenes[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]—considerations
	which now and for a long time past, without reason and with utter recklessness, we have treated with contempt. For some have gone to such an extreme of folly as to hold the view that, while injustice is reprehensible, it is, nevertheless, profitable and advantageous in our lives day by day, and that, while justice is estimable, it is for all that disadvantageous and more capable of benefiting others than of helping those who practise it.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] They fail to see that nothing in the world can contribute so powerfully to material gain, to good repute, to right action, in a word, to happiness, as virtue and the

	qualities of virtue.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For it is by the good qualities which we have in our souls that we acquire also the other advantages of which we stand in need.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] So that those who have no care for their own state of mind are unwittingly disparaging the means of attaining at the same time to greater wisdom and to greater well-being.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I marvel if anyone thinks that those who practise piety and justice remain constant and steadfast in these virtues because they expect to be worse off than the wicked and not because they consider that both among gods and among men[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] they will have the advantage over others. I, for my part, am persuaded that they and they alone gain advantage in the true sense, while the others gain advantage only in the baser sense of that term. For I observe that those who prefer the way of injustice, thinking it the greatest good fortune to seize something that belongs to others, are in like case with animals which are lured by a bait, at the first deriving pleasure from what they seize, but the moment after finding themselves in desperate straits, while those who live a life of piety and justice pass their days in security for the present and have sweeter hopes for all eternity.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	cannot see clearly what will always be to their advantage, to show to the world that they prefer that which is generally beneficial. On the other hand, they are of all men most afflicted with unreason who concede that justice is a way of life more noble and more pleasing to the gods than injustice but at the same time believe that those who follow it will live in worse case than those who have chosen the way of evil.

	I could wish that, even as to praise virtue is a facile theme, so it were easy to persuade hearers to practise it. But as things are I am afraid that I may be expressing such sentiments to no purpose. For we have been depraved for a long time by men whose only ability is to cheat and delude—men who have held the people in such contempt that whenever they wish to bring about a state of war with any city, these very men who are paid[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] for what they say have the audacity to tell us that we should follow the example of our ancestors and not allow ourselves to be made a laughing-stock nor permit those Hellenes to sail the sea who are unwilling to pay us their contributions. Now I should be glad if they would inform me what ancestors they would have us imitate. Do they mean those who lived at the time of the Persian Wars[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] or those who governed the city before the Decelean War[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]? If they mean the latter then they are simply advising us to run the risk once again of being enslaved[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]; but if they mean those who at Marathon conquered the barbarians, then they are of all men the most brazen, if, that is to say, they

	praise those who governed Athens at that time and in the same breath would persuade us to act in a manner contrary to theirs and to commit blunders so gross that I am at a loss what I should do—whether
	I should speak the truth as on all other occasions or be silent out of fear of making myself odious to you. For while it seems to me the better course to discuss your blunders, I observe that you are more resentful towards those who take you to task than towards those who are the authors of your misfortunes. Nevertheless I should be ashamed if I showed that I am more concerned about my own reputation than about the public safety. It is, therefore, my duty and the duty of all who care about the welfare of the state to choose, not those discourses which are agreeable to you, but those which are profitable for you to hear. And you, for your part, ought to realize, in the first place, that while many treatments of all kinds have been discovered by physicians for the ills of our bodies, there exists no remedy for souls which are ignorant of the truth and filled with base desires other than the kind of discourse[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] which boldly rebukes the sins which they commit, and, in the second place, that it is absurd to submit to the cauteries and cuttings of physicians in order that we may be relieved of greater pains and yet refuse to hear discourses before knowing clearly whether or not they have the power to benefit their hearers.

	I have said these things at the outset because in the rest of my discourse I am going to speak without reserve and with complete frankness. For suppose that a stranger from another part of the world were to come to Athens,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] having had no time to be tainted

For while they waged war without ceasing in behalf of the Hellenes against the barbarians, we removed from their homes those who derive their livelihood from Asia and led them against the Hellenes;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and while they liberated the cities of Hellas[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and lent them their aid and so were adjudged worthy of the hegemony, we seek to enslave these cities[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and pursue a policy the very opposite of theirs and then feel aggrieved that we are not held in like honour with them—we who fall so far short of those who lived in those days both in our deeds and in our thoughts that, whereas they brought themselves to abandon their country[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] for the sake of saving the other Hellenes and fought and conquered the barbarians both on the land and on the sea,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] we do not see fit to run any risk even for our own advantage; on the contrary, although we seek to rule over all men, we are not willing to take the field ourselves,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] and although we undertake to wage war upon, one might almost say, the whole world,[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] we do not train ourselves for war but employ instead vagabonds, deserters, and fugitives who have

	most flagrantly guilty of this crime as our generals[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and we pick out the man who has been able to deprave the greatest number of our citizens and place him in charge of the most important affairs. We are concerned about our polity no less than about the safety of the whole state and we know that our democracy flourishes and endures in times of peace and security while in times of war it has twice already been overthrown,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] but we are hostile to those who desire peace as if suspecting them of favouring oligarchy,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] while we are friendly to those who advocate war as if assured of their devotion to democracy. We are versed beyond all others in discourse and in the conduct of affairs, but we are so devoid of reason that we do not hold the same views about the same question on the same day; on the contrary, the things which we condemn before we enter the assembly are the very things which we vote for when we are in session, and again a little later when we depart to our homes we disapprove of the things which we resolved upon here.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] We pretend that we are the wisest of the Hellenes, but we employ the kind of advisers whom no one could fail to despise, and we place these very same men in control of all our public interests to whom no one would entrust a single one of his private affairs. But, what is most reprehensible of all, we regard those whom all would acknowledge to be the most depraved of our citizens[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]

	money to the orators to advocate a war policy, especially
	to the orator Aristophon, who may be alluded to in 36 and
	in this paragraph. Chares in the field and Aristophon on the

So far are we different from our ancestors that whereas they chose the same men to preside over the city and to be generals in the field,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] since they believed that one who could give the best counsel on this platform would best take counsel with himself when alone, we ourselves do the very opposite; for the men whose counsels we follow in matters of the greatest importance—these we do not see fit to elect as our generals, as if distrusting their intelligence, but men whose counsel no one would seek either on his own business or on that of the state—these we send into the field with unlimited authority,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] as if expecting that they will be wiser abroad than at home and will find it easier to take counsel on questions pertaining to the Hellenes than on those which are proposed for consideration here. I say these things, not with reference to all, but with reference to those only who are open to the charges which I have made. However, the remainder of the day would not suffice me if I should attempt to review all the errors which have crept into our conduct of affairs.

	“How is it, if indeed we are so badly advised, that we are safe and hold a power which is inferior to that of no other city?” I, for my part, would reply to this question that we have in our adversaries men who are no more prudent than ourselves. For example, if the Thebans, after the battle which they won over the Lacedaemonians,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] had contented themselves with liberating the Peloponnesus and making the other Hellenes independent[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and had thenceforth pursued peace, while we continued to make such blunders, then neither could this man have asked such a question nor could we ourselves have failed to realize how much better moderation is than meddlesomeness. But now matters have taken such a turn that the Thebans are saving us and we them, and they are procuring allies for us and we for them.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] So that if we were sensible we should supply each other with money for our general assemblies; for the oftener we meet to deliberate the more do we promote the success of our rivals. But those among us who are able to exercise even a modicum of reason ought not to rest our hopes of safety upon the blunders of our enemies but upon our own management of affairs and upon our own judgement. For the good fortune which results to us from their stupidity might perhaps cease or change to the opposite, whereas that which comes about because of our own efforts will be more certain and more enduring.

	and object, while conceding that I speak the truth and am correct in condemning the things which are taking place, that we have a right to expect of those who seek to admonish us with friendly purpose that they should not only denounce what has been done[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but should also counsel us what to abstain from and what to strive for in order to cease from this way of thinking and from making such blunders, his objection would place me at a loss, not for a true answer and one that would be profitable, but for one that would be acceptable to you. But since I have set out to speak openly I must not shrink from disclosing what I think on these matters also.

	Well then, the qualities which we must possess as a foundation if we are to be happy and prosperous, namely, piety and moderation and justice and virtue in all its phases, I mentioned a moment ago.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] But as to the means by which we may most speedily be taught to attain to such a character, what I am going to say though true will probably seem repellent to you when you have heard it as well as far removed from the opinions held by others. For I, for my part, consider that we shall manage our city to better advantage and be ourselves better men and go forward in. all our undertakings if we stop setting our hearts on the empire of the sea. For it is this which plunged us into our present state of disorder, which overthrew that democratic government[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] under which our ancestors lived and were the happiest of the Hellenes, and which is the cause, one might almost say, of all the ills which we both suffer ourselves and inflict upon the rest of the Hellenes.

	I know, however, that it is difficult for one who attempts to denounce that imperial power which all the world lusts after and has waged many wars to obtain to impress his hearers as saying anything which is not intolerable. Nevertheless, since you have endured the other things which I have said, which, although true, are offensive, I beg you to be patient also with what I shall say upon this subject and not to impute to me the madness of having chosen to discourse to you on matters so contrary to the general opinion without having something true to say about them. Nay, I believe that I shall make it evident to all that we covet an empire which is neither just nor capable of being attained nor advantageous to ourselves.

	Now that it is not just I can show you by lessons which I have learned from yourselves. For when the Lacedaemonians held this power,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] what eloquence did we not expend in denouncing, their rule, contending that it was just for the Hellenes to enjoy independence? What cities of repute did we not call upon to join the alliance[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] which was formed in this cause? How many embassies did we not dispatch to the great King[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] to convince him that it was neither just nor expedient for one state to dominate the Hellenes? Indeed we did not cease waging war and facing perils both by land and sea until the Lacedaemonians were willing to enter into the treaty which guaranteed our independence.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	the weaker,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] even as now we recognize it in the nature of the polity which has been established amongst ourselves. But that we could not, if we would, attain to this empire by conquest I think I shall quickly prove. For when, with the help of ten thousand talents,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] we were not able to retain it, how can we acquire it in our present state of poverty, especially since we are now addicted, not to the ways of life by which we gained it, but to those by which we lost it? Furthermore, that it is not even for the advantage of the state to accept this empire, if it were offered to us, I think you will learn very quickly from what further I have to say. But first I want to say a word by way of leading up to this point, fearing that, on account of my many strictures, I may give the impression to some of you of having chosen to denounce our city.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If I were attempting to discourse in this manner before any others, I should naturally lay myself open to this charge. But now I am addressing myself to you, not with the wish that I may prejudice you in the eyes of others, but with the desire that I may cause you to make an end of such a policy and that Athens and the rest of the Hellenes may form a lasting peace.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But those who admonish and those who denounce cannot avoid using similar words, although their purposes are as opposite as they can be.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] You ought not, therefore, to have the same feeling towards all who use the same language but, while abhorring those who revile you to your harm as inimical to the state, you ought to commend those who admonish
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]That is, we recognized it as valid not only in our
	domestic relations but in our foreign policy.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]A round number. [c dimgray]Cf. Antid.[/c] 234. In 126 he speaks of
	8000. Thucydides (ii. 13. 3) states that 9700 talents was
	the largest amount ever stored on the Acropolis.

	These, then, are the things which I have to say in defence of my harshness both in the words which I have spoken and those which I am about to speak. I will now resume at the place where I left off. For I was on the point of saying that you could best learn that it is not to your advantage to obtain the empire of the sea if you should consider what was the condition of Athens before she acquired this power and what after she obtained it. For if you will examine one condition in contrast with the other you will see how many evils this power has brought upon the city.

	so trusted that most of the states of their own free will placed themselves under their leadership.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But, notwithstanding these advantages, in place of a polity which was admired by all men this power has led us on to a state of licence which no one in the world could commend; in place of our habit of conquering those who took the field against us it has instilled into our citizens such ways that they have not the courage even to go out in front of the walls to meet the enemy;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and in place of the good will which was accorded us by our allies and of the good repute in which we were held by the rest of the Hellenes it brought us into such a degree of odium that Athens barely escaped being enslaved and would have suffered this fate had we not found the Lacedaemonians, who were at war with us from the first, more friendly than those who were formerly our allies[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]—not that we can have any just complaint against the latter for being obdurate towards us; for they were not aggressors but on the defensive, and came to have this feeling after suffering many grievous wrongs at our hands. For who could have brooked the insolence of our fathers? Gathering together from all Hellas men who were the worst of idlers and men who had a part in every form of depravity and manning their triremes with them,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] they made themselves odious to the Hellenes,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] driving into exile the best of the citizens in the other states[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]

	But if I were to make bold to go through in detail what took place in those times I might probably help you to be better advised regarding the present situation, but I should prejudice my own reputation; for you are wont to hate not so much those who are responsible for your mistakes as those who undertake to denounce them. I fear, therefore, since you are of such a mind, that if I attempt to benefit you I may myself reap a poor reward. Nevertheless, I am not going to refrain entirely from saying the things which I had in mind but shall pass over the most severe and, mayhap, the most painful to you and recall to your minds only the facts by which you will recognize the folly of the men who at that time governed the city.

	For so exactly did they gauge[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] the actions by which human beings incur the worst odium that they passed a decree to divide the surplus of the funds derived from the tributes of the allies into talents and to bring it on the stage,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] when the theatre was full, at the festival of Dionysus[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]; and not only was this done but at the same time they led in upon the stage the sons of those who had lost their lives in the war,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] seeking thus to display to our allies,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] on the one hand, the value of their own property[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]

	the division into talents is obscure. Perhaps one talent was
	distributed at each festival.

	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]The state brought them up at public expense until they

	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]It appears that the “tribute” money of the allies during the Confederacy of Delos was brought to Athens by their representatives at the time of the Dionysiac festival. See Aristophanes, [c dimgray]Acharnians[/c] 505, 643. Besides, the festival attracted many unofficial visitors from the other states.

	which was brought in by hirelings,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and to the rest of the Hellenes, on the other, the multitude of the fatherless and the misfortunes which result from this policy of aggression. And in doing this they themselves counted the city happy, while many of the simple-minded deemed it blessed, taking no thought whatsoever for future consequences but admiring and envying the wealth which flowed into the city unjustly and which was soon to destroy also that which justly belonged to it. For they reached such a degree of neglect of their own possessions and of covetousness of the possessions of other states that when the Lacedaemonians had invaded our territory and the fortifications at Decelea[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] had already been built, they manned triremes to send to Sicily[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and were not ashamed to permit their own country to be cut off and plundered[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] by the enemy while dispatching an expedition against a people who had never in any respect offended against us. Nay, they arrived at such a pitch of folly that at a time when they were not masters of their own suburbs[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] they expected to extend their power over Italy and Sicily and Carthage.[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] And so far did they outdo all mankind in recklessness that whereas misfortunes chasten others

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The text clearly means “brought in by paid men.”
	But μισθωτοί may be either paid servants or paid soldiers.
	The former meaning is generally preferred by the editors
	because only in a loose sense could it be said that the tribute
	was brought in by mercenaries; besides, the present tense
	is employed. Nevertheless the reader will think of the
	hirelings mentioned just before (in 79) with whom the
	Athenians manned their triremes and through whom they
	forced the payment of the tribute, and doubtless the author
	so intended.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]This strong position on the slope of Mt. Parnes in Attica was seized and fortified by the Spartans as an outpost from which to raid Athenian territory in 413 b.c.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The original expedition to Sicily was dispatched in 415 b.c. Strong reinforcements were, however, sent at the time Decelea was fortified by the Spartans. See Thuc. vii. 20.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]See 92.
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]Decelea was 14 miles from Athens, but the Athenians kept within their walls, and the Spartans ravaged their territory almost at will. See Thuc. vii. 19 ff.

	and render them more prudent our fathers learned no lessons even from this discipline. And yet they were involved in more and greater disasters in the time of the empire[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] than have ever befallen Athens in all the rest of her history. Two hundred ships which set sail for Egypt perished with their crews,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and a hundred and fifty off the island of Cyprus;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] in the Decelean War[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] they lost ten thousand heavy armed troops of their own and of their allies, and in Sicily forty thousand men and two hundred and forty ships,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and, finally, in the Hellespont two hundred ships.[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] But of the ships which were lost in fleets of ten or five or more and of the men who were slain in armies of a thousand or two thousand who could tell the tale? In a word, it was at that time a matter of regular routine to hold public funerals[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] every year, which many both of our neighbours and of the other Hellenes used to attend, not to grieve with us for the dead, but to rejoice together at our misfortunes. And at last, before they knew it, they had filled the public burial-grounds[c dimgray][sup]h[/sup][/c] with the bodies of their fellow-citizens and the registers of the

	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Thucydides (i. 112) speaks of a fleet of 200 ships of which
	60 were sent to Egypt, the remainder under Cimon laying

	in the loss of men and money, was not disastrous like
	the former.

	papyrus is at least preferable since the loss of 10,000 hoplites
	(unless a hopeless exaggeration) cannot be accounted for if the reading of ΓΕ or that of the other mss. is adopted. See Laistner in [c dimgray]Classical Quarterly[/c] xv. p. 81. At the beginning of the Peloponnesian War (according to Thuc. ii. 13), the Athenian heavy-armed troops numbered 29,000. Later (according to [c dimgray]Against Aristog[/c]., attributed to Demosthenes, 51), the whole body of Athenian citizens numbered but 20,000.
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]Diodorus (xiii. 21) gives the same number of men, but 200 ships, Thucydides gives the number of ships as 209 and the number of men as not less than 40,000, including heavy and light armed troops, crews, etc. See especially vii. 75. 5.

And you may judge of the multitude of the slain from this fact: The families of the most illustrious Athenians and our greatest houses, which survived the civil conflicts under the tyrants[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and the Persian Wars as well, have been, you will find, entirely wiped out[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] under this empire upon which we set our hearts. So that if one desired to go into the question of what befel the rest of our citizens, judging by this instance, it would be seen that we have been changed, one might almost say, into a new people.

	And yet we must not count that state happy which without discrimination recruits from all parts of the world a large number of citizens but rather that state which more than all others preserves the stock of those who in the beginning founded it. And we ought not to emulate those who hold despotic power nor those who have gained a dominion which is greater than is just but rather those who, while worthy of the highest honours, are yet content with the honours which are tendered them by a free people. For no man nor any state could obtain a position more excellent than this or more secure or of greater worth. And it was because they acquired just this position that our ancestors in the time of the Persian Wars did not live in the manner of freebooters, now having more than enough for their needs, again reduced to a state of famine and siege[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and extreme misfortune[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]; on the contrary, while they lived neither in want nor in surfeit of the means of subsistence

	day by day, they prided themselves on the justice of their polity and on their own virtues, and passed their lives more pleasantly than the rest of the world.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But, heedless of these lessons, those who came after them desired, not to rule but to dominate[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—words
	which are thought to have the same meaning, although between them there is the utmost difference. For it is the duty of those who rule to make their subjects happier through their care for their welfare,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] whereas it is a habit of those who dominate to provide pleasures for themselves through the labours and hardships of others. But it is in the nature of things that those who attempt a despot’s course must encounter the disasters which befall despotic power[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and be afflicted by the very things which they inflict upon others. And it is just this which has happened in the case of Athens; for in place of holding the citadels of other states, her people saw the day when the enemy were in possession of the Acropolis[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]; in place of dragging children from their mothers and fathers and taking them as hostages,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] many of her citizens, living in a state of siege, were compelled to educate and support their children with less than was their due; and in place of farming the lands of other states,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] for many years[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] they were denied the opportunity of even setting eyes upon their own fields.

	answer yes, except some utterly abandoned wretch who cared not for sacred matters nor for parents nor for children nor for any other thing save for the term of his own existence? We, however, ought not to emulate the judgement of such men but rather that of those who exercise great forethought and are no less jealous for the reputation of the state than for their own—men who prefer a moderate competence with justice to great wealth unjustly gained. For our ancestors,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] proving themselves to be men of this character, handed on the city to their descendants in a most prosperous condition and left behind them an imperishable memorial of their virtue. And from this we may easily learn a double lesson: that our soil is able to rear better men than the rest of the world[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and that what we call empire, though in reality it is misfortune,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] is of a nature to deprave all who have to do with it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	We have a most convincing proof of this. For imperialism worked the ruin not only of Athens but of the city of the Lacedaemonians also, so that those who are in the habit of praising the virtues of Sparta[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] cannot argue that we managed our affairs badly because of our democratic government whereas if the Lacedaemonians had taken over the empire the results would have been happy both for the rest of the Hellenes and for themselves. For this power revealed its nature much more quickly in their case.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] Indeed it brought it to pass that a polity which over a period of seven hundred years[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] had never, so far as we know,

For in place of the ways of life established among them it filled the citizens with injustice, indolence, lawlessness and avarice and the commonwealth with contempt for its allies, covetousness of the possessions of other states, and indifference to its oaths and covenants. In fact they went so far beyond our ancestors in their crimes against the Hellenes that in addition to the evils which already afflicted the several states they stirred up in them slaughter and strife,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in consequence of which their citizens will cherish for each other a hatred unquenchable. And they became so addicted to war and the perils of war that, whereas in times past they had been more cautious in this regard[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] than the rest of the world, they did not refrain from attacking even their own allies and their own benefactors; on the contrary, although the great King had furnished them with more than five thousand talents[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] for the war against us, and although the Chians[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] had supported them more zealously than any of their other allies by means of their fleet and the Thebans[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] had contributed a great number of troops to their land forces, the Lacedaemonians no sooner gained the supremacy than they straightway plotted against the Thebans,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] dispatched Clearchus with an army against the King,[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] and in the case of the Chians

	[m1]\ [/m]
	However, they were not satisfied with perpetrating these crimes, but about the same time were ravaging the Asiatic coast,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] committing outrages against the islands,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] subverting the free governments in Italy and Sicily, setting up despotisms in their stead,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] overrunning the Peloponnesus and filling it with seditions and wars. For, tell me, against which of the cities of Hellas did they fail to take the field? Which of them did they fail to wrong? Did they not rob the Eleans of part of their territory,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] did they not lay waste the land of the Corinthians,[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] did they not disperse the Mantineans from their homes,[c dimgray][sup]h[/sup][/c] did they not reduce the Phliasians by siege,[c dimgray][sup]i[/sup][/c] and did they not invade the country of the Argives,[c dimgray][sup]j[/sup][/c] never ceasing from their depredations upon the rest of the world and so bringing upon themselves the disaster at Leuctra?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Some maintain that this disaster was the cause of the misfortunes which overtook Sparta, but they do not speak the truth. For it was not because of this that they incurred the hatred of their allies; it was because of their insolence in the time preceding that they were defeated in this battle and fell into peril of losing their own city. We must not attribute the cause to any subsequent misfortunes but to their crimes in the beginning, as the result of which they

So that anyone would be much more in accord with the truth if he should assert that they first became subject to the dominion of their present ills at the moment when they attempted to seize the dominion of the sea,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] since they were seeking to acquire a power which was in no wise like that which they had before possessed. For because of their supremacy on land and of their stern discipline and of the self-control which was cultivated under it, they readily obtained command of the sea, whereas because of the arrogance[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] which was bred in them by that power they speedily lost the supremacy both on land and sea. For they no longer kept the laws which they had inherited from their ancestors nor remained faithful to the ways which they had followed in times past, but conceived that they were licensed to do whatever they pleased and so were plunged into great confusion.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For they did not know that this licence which all the world aspires to attain is a difficult thing to manage, that it turns the heads of those who are enamoured by it, and that it is in its nature like courtesans, who lure their victims to love but destroy those who indulge this passion. And yet it has been shown clearly that it has this effect; for anyone can see that those who have been in the strongest position to do whatever they pleased have been involved in the greatest disasters, ourselves and the Lacedaemonians first of all. For when these states, which in time past had governed themselves with the utmost sobriety and enjoyed the highest esteem,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] attained to this licence and seized the empire, they differed

	in no respect from each other, but, as is natural in the case of those who have been depraved by the same passions and the same malady, they attempted the same deeds and indulged in similar crimes and, finally, fell into like disasters. For we, being hated by our allies and standing in peril of being enslaved, were saved by the Lacedaemonians;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and just so they, when all the rest wanted to destroy them, came to us for refuge and were saved through us.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] And yet how can we praise a dominion which subjects us to so miserable an end? How can we fail to abhor and shun a power which has incited these two cities both to do and to suffer many abominable things?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But, after all, we should not be surprised that in the past all men have failed to see that this power is the cause of so many ills to those who hold it, nor should we wonder that it has been the bone of contention between us and the Lacedaemonians. For you will find that the great majority of mankind go astray in choosing a course of action and, being possessed of more desires for things evil than for things good, take counsel more in the interest of their foes than of themselves. You can observe this in matters of the greatest importance. For when has it ever happened otherwise? Did we not choose to pursue a policy in consequence of which the Lacedaemonians became masters of the Hellenes? Did not they, in their turn, manage their supremacy so badly that not many years later we again got the upper hand and became the arbiters of their safety? Did not the meddlesomeness of the partizans of Athens cause the various states to become partizans of Sparta, and did not the insolence of the partizans

	of Sparta force these same states to become partizans of Athens? Did not the people themselves, because of the depravity of the popular orators, desire the oligarchy which was established under the Four Hundred? And have not we, all of us, because of the madness of the Thirty,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] become greater enthusiasts for democracy than those who occupied Phyle[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]? Indeed in matters of lesser importance and in our every-day life, one could show that the majority take pleasure in the foods and habits which injure both the body and the soul but consider laborious and irksome those from which both sides of our nature would benefit, and that those men are looked upon as austere who remain steadfast in habits which are beneficial.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Since, therefore, in the circumstances in which they live every day and about which they are more directly concerned, men show that they prefer the worse to the better course, how can we be surprised if they lack insight regarding the empire of the sea and make war upon each other to possess a power regarding which they have never reflected in their lives?

	Look at the one-man-rule which is established in various states and observe how many there are who aspire to it and are ready to undergo anything whatsoever to obtain it. And yet what that is dire and difficult is not its portion?[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Is it not true that when men obtain unlimited power they find themselves at once in the coil of so many troubles that they are compelled to make war upon all their citizens, to hate those from whom they have suffered no wrong whatsoever, to suspect their own friends

And yet it is not the least important sign of whether men are possessed of intelligence if they are seen to recognize the same course of conduct in all cases that are comparable.[c dimgray][sup]h[/sup][/c] But you have never given this a thought; on the contrary, while you consider the power of a despot to

	be harsh and harmful not only to others but to those who hold it, you look upon the empire of the sea as the greatest good in the world, when in fact it differs neither in what it does nor in what it suffers from one-man-rule. And you think that the affairs of the Thebans are in a bad way because they oppress their neighbours,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but, although you yourselves are treating your allies no better than the Thebans treat the Boeotians, you believe that your own actions leave nothing to be desired.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If, then, you heed my advice you will stop taking counsel in your utterly haphazard fashion and give your attention to your own and the state’s welfare, pondering and searching into these questions: What is it which caused these two states—Athens and Sparta I mean—to rise, each one of them, from obscure beginnings to be the first power in Hellas and then to fall, after they had attained a power second to none, into peril of being enslaved? What are the reasons that the Thessalians, who inherited very great wealth and possess a very rich and abundant territory,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] have been reduced to poverty, while the Megarians, who had small and insignificant resources[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] to begin with and who possess neither land nor harbours[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] nor mines but are compelled to farm mere rocks, own estates which are the greatest[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] among the Hellenes? Why is it that the Thessalians, with a cavalry of more than three thousand horse and light-armed troops beyond number,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] have their fortresses occupied from time to time by certain

	other states[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] while the Megarians, with only a small force, govern their city as they see fit? And, again, why is it that the Thessalians are always at war with each other while the Megarians, who dwell between the Peloponnesians on the one hand and the Thebans and the Athenians on the other, are continually in a state of peace?[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] If you will go over these and similar questions in your minds, you will discover that arrogance and insolence have been the cause of our misfortunes while sobriety and self-control have been the source of our blessings.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But, while you commend sobriety in individual men and believe that those who practise it enjoy the most secure existence and are the best among your fellow-citizens, you do not think it fit to make the state practise it. And yet it behoves states much more than individuals to cultivate the virtues and to shun vices;[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] for a man who is godless and depraved may die before paying the penalty for his sins, but states, since they are deathless, soon or late must submit to punishment at the hands both of men and of the gods.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	These considerations you should bear in mind and not pay heed to those who gratify you for the moment, while caring nothing for the future, nor to those who profess to love the people, but are in fact the bane of the whole state; since in times past also when men of this character took over the supremacy of the rostrum,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] they led the city on to such a degree

	And indeed what is most astonishing of all in your conduct is that you prefer as leaders of the people, not those who are of the same mind as the men who made Athens great, but those who say and do the same kind of things as the men who destroyed her power; and you do this albeit knowing full well that it is not alone in making the city prosperous that good leaders are superior to the base, but that our democracy itself under the leadership of the former remained unshaken and unchanged for many years,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] whereas under the guidance of these men it has already, within a short period of time,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] been twice overthrown, and that, furthermore, our people who were driven into exile under the despots and in the time of the Thirty were restored to the state, not through the efforts of the sycophants,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] but through those leaders who despised men of that character and were held in the highest respect for their integrity.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

And yet Pericles,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] who was the leader of the people before men of this stamp came into favour, taking over the state when it was less prudent than it had been before it obtained the supremacy, although it was still tolerably well governed, was not bent upon his own enrichment,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] but left an estate which was smaller than that which he received from his father, while he brought up into the Acropolis eight thousand talents,[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] apart from the sacred treasures.

	our people, for whom they pretend to care, are in such straits that not one of our citizens is able to live with pleasure or at ease; on the contrary, Athens is rife with lamentations. For some are driven to rehearse and bewail amongst themselves their poverty and privation while others deplore the multitude of duties enjoined upon them by the state—the liturgies and all the nuisances connected with the symmories and with exchanges of property;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] for these are so annoying that those who have means find life more burdensome than those who are continually in want.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I marvel that you cannot see at once that no class is so inimical to the people as our depraved orators and demagogues. For, as if your other misfortunes were not enough, their chief desire is that you should be in want of your daily necessities, observing that those who are able to manage their affairs from their private incomes are on the side of the commonwealth and of our best counsellors, whereas those who live off the law-courts and the assemblies[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and the doles derived from them are constrained by their need to be subservient to the sycophants and are deeply grateful for the impeachments and the indictments[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and the other sharp practices which are due to the sycophants. Wherefore these men would be most happy to see all of our citizens reduced to the condition

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The burdens of state expense were theoretically carried
	by those best able to bear them. The twelve hundred
	richest citizens were divided in accordance with their wealth
	into twenty classes, called symmories. Special tax levies
	for war purposes were levied upon them in proportion to
	their means. Besides, men of the wealthiest class were
	called upon to perform the “liturgies” at their own expense.
	One of the most burdensome of these was the trierarchy—fitting
	out a battleship for service and maintaining it in fighting trim for one year. If a man called upon to undertake such a burden felt that another could better afford to stand the expense he had the right to demand that he do so or else exchange property with him. See [c dimgray]Antid[/c]. 145, note, and the introduction to that discourse.

	What, then, is the way of escape from our present ills? I have already discussed most of the points which bear upon this question, not in sequence, but as each fell into its opportune place. But perhaps it will help you to hold them in memory if I attempt to bring together and review those which more than others press upon our attention.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The first way by which we can set right and improve the condition of our city is to select as our advisers on affairs of state the kind of men whose advice we should desire on our private affairs, and to stop thinking of the sycophants as friends of democracy and of the good men and true[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] among us as friends of oligarchy,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] realizing that no man is by nature either the one or the other but that all men desire, in each case, to establish that form of government in which they are held in honour. The second way is to be willing to treat our allies just as we would our friends and not to grant them independence in words, while in fact giving them over to our generals to do with as they please,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and not to exercise our leadership as masters but as helpers,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] since we have learned the lesson that while we are stronger than any single state we are weaker than all Hellas.

	nothing is more important, save only to show reverence to the gods, than to have a good name among the Hellenes. For upon those who are so regarded they willingly confer both sovereign power and leadership.

	If, then, you will abide by the advice which I have given you, and if, besides, you will prove yourselves warlike by training and preparing for war but peaceful by doing nothing contrary to justice,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] you will render not only this city but all the Hellenes happy and prosperous. For no other of the states will dare to oppress them; on the contrary, they will hold back and studiously avoid aggression when they see the power of Athens on the alert and ready to go to the aid of the oppressed. But no matter what course the rest may take, our own position will be honourable and advantageous; for if the foremost states resolve to abstain from acts of oppression, we shall have the credit for this blessing; but if, on the other hand, they attempt to oppress others, then all who fear them and suffer evil at their hands will come to us for refuge, with many prayers and supplications, offering us not only the hegemony but their own support. So that we shall not lack for allies to help us to check the oppressors but shall find many ready and willing to join their forces to our own. For what city or what men will not be eager to share our friendship and our alliance when they see that the Athenians are at once the most just and the most powerful of peoples and are at the same time both willing and able to save the other states, while needing no help for themselves?

	better should you expect the affairs of our city to take when we enjoy such good will from the rest of the Hellenes? What wealth will flow into Athens when through her all Hellas is made secure? And who among men will fail to praise those who will have been the authors of blessings so many and so great?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I am not able because of my age[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] to include in my speech all the things which I grasp in my thought, save that it is a noble enterprise for us, in the midst of the injustice and madness of the rest of the world, to be the first to adopt a sane policy and stand forth as the champions of the freedom of the Hellenes, to be acclaimed as their saviours, not their destroyers,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and to become illustrious for our virtues and regain the good repute which our ancestors possessed.

	But I have yet to touch upon the chief consideration of all—that upon which centres everything that I have said and in the light of which we should appraise the actions of the state. For if we really wish to clear away the prejudice in which we are held at the present time, we must cease from the wars which are waged to no purpose and so gain for our city the hegemony for all time; we must abhor all despotic rule and imperial power, reflecting upon the disasters which have sprung from them; and we must emulate and imitate the position held by the kings of Lacedaemon: they, it is true, have less freedom than their private citizens to do wrong,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] yet are much more enviable than those who hold despotic power by force; for those who take the lives of despots are given the highest rewards by their

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	In 355 b.c. ended the deplorable “Social War,” which Athens waged against the most powerful members of her Confederacy in the effort to compel them to remain under her sway. She was not successful: Chios, Cos, Rhodes, and Byzantium were conceded their independence. But there remained still under her influence the many weaker members of her maritime empire; and peace, as usual, brought a sense of great relief and of false security.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This is the very time which Isocrates found opportune for addressing the Athenians on the “public safety.”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] The strength of a state, he warns them, consists, not in the walls which gird a city, but in the quality of its citizenship and in the spirit which animates its polity. In this respect, Athens has no ground whatever for pride or even for complacency; for her life has become, he maintains, unsound at the core. She is far from being now what she was in the days of the old democracy of Solon and of Cleisthenes.

	degeneracy found in Isocrates and in the other orators and philosophers of the fourth century. But even when we make due allowance for exaggeration in the contrasts which are drawn between the
	“golden age” and the present, we do well to reckon with the fact of a change which was not for the better.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Pericles, in the funeral oration recorded by Thucydides, said of the Athenians: “Their bodies they devote to their country as though they belonged to other men: their true self is their mind, which is most truly their own when employed in her service.” That expresses something more than an ideal of the older democracy. How closely the life of the individual was in fact bound up with that of the state is revealed in the common use of the word πολιτεύεσθαι, [c dimgray]to live as a citizen,[/c] instead of the bare term [c dimgray]to live[/c]. But in the fourth century, the Athenians were living more and more their own lives, selfishly pursuing their own business or living off the state rather than for it, and craving increasingly the liberty to “do as they liked.”

	Isocrates’ diagnosis of the trouble and his remedy for it are, no doubt, over-simple. The weakness of Athens he attributes mainly to an excess of “freedom.” Pure democracy is not to his liking—a polity in which election by lot is the last word in the equalization of opportunity and the levelling of all distinctions. He pleads for a return to the restricted democracy of Solon and of Cleisthenes, in which the people possessed the sovereign power to elect their leaders, but only from the best qualified citizens,

	and to hold them strictly to account for their conduct in office—an aristocracy in effect. Specifically, he pleads for the restoration of the old powers of the Council of the Areopagus. That Council had in early times possessed almost unlimited authority. In Solon’s time it was still the greatest power of the state, being entrusted with the guardianship of the laws, with the supervision over the education of youth, with a general censorship over the lives of the citizens, and with final authority to fine or otherwise punish offenders against law, custom, or taste.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	No doubt it irritated many by its conservative influence and sometimes abused its power, but it is noteworthy that it was everywhere and at all times held in high respect. Aeschylus’s tribute to it in the [c dimgray]Eumenides[/c],[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] put in the mouth of Athena, the guardian deity of the state, is an eloquent expression of the common feeling:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	This Court, majestic, incorruptible,
	Instant in anger, over those who sleep,
	The sleepless watcher of my land I set.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	It continued to be held in awe even after Ephialtes, in the interest of a more complete democracy, had shorn it of most of its powers. But from this time on, Isocrates holds, Athenian life declined in the matter of sober living and of willing service to the state—a view in which he is supported by the circumstantial account of Aristotle in his sketch of the development of the Athenian constitution.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	Many of you are wondering, I suppose, what in the world my purpose is[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in coming forward to address you on [c dimgray]the public safety[/c], as if Athens were in danger or her affairs on an uncertain footing, when in fact she possesses more than two hundred ships-of-war, enjoys peace throughout her territory, maintains her empire on the sea,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and has, furthermore, many allies who, in case of any need, will readily come to her aid,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and many more allies who are paying their contributions[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and obeying her commands. With these resources, one might argue that we have every reason to feel secure, as being far removed from danger, while our enemies may well be anxious and take thought for their own safety.

	Now you, I know, following this reasoning, disdain my coming forward, and are confident that with this power you will hold all Hellas under your control. But as for myself, it is because of these very things that I am anxious; for I observe that those cities

	which think they are in the best circumstances are wont to adopt the worst policies, and that those which feel the most secure are most often involved in danger. The cause of this is that nothing of either good or of evil visits mankind unmixed, but that riches and power are attended and followed by folly, and folly in turn by licence;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] whereas poverty and lowliness are attended by sobriety and great moderation; so that it is hard to decide which of these lots one should prefer to bequeath to one’s own children. For we shall find that from a lot which seems to be inferior men’s fortunes generally advance to a better condition,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] whereas from one which appears to be superior they are wont to change to a worse. Of this truth I might cite examples without number from the lives of individual men, since these are subject to the most frequent vicissitudes; but instances which are more important and better known to my hearers may be drawn from the experiences of our city and of the Lacedaemonians. As for the Athenians, after our city had been laid waste by the barbarians, we became, because we were anxious about the future and gave attention to our affairs, the foremost of the Hellenes;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] whereas, when we imagined that our power was invincible, we barely escaped being enslaved.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Likewise the Lacedaemonians, after having set out in ancient times from obscure and humble cities, made themselves, because

	in one place, but rather with those who most nobly and wisely govern their state. For the soul of a state is nothing else than its polity,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] having as much power over it as does the mind over the body; for it is this which deliberates upon all questions, seeking to preserve what is good and to ward off what is disastrous; and it is this which of necessity assimilates to its own nature the laws, the public orators and the private citizens; and all the members of the state must fare well or ill according to the kind of polity under which they live. And yet we are quite indifferent to the fact that our polity has been corrupted, nor do we even consider how we may redeem it. It is true that we sit around in our shops[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] denouncing the present order and complaining that never under a democracy have we been worse governed, but in our actions and in the sentiments which we hold regarding it we show that we are better satisfied with our present democracy than with that which was handed down to us by our forefathers.

	can avert future perils from us and deliver us from our present ills is that we should be willing to restore that earlier democracy which was instituted by Solon, who proved himself above all others the friend of the people, and which was re-established by Cleisthenes, who drove out the tyrants and brought the people back into power—a government than which we could find none more favourable to the populace or more advantageous to the

And how can we escape the fear that if we continue to progress after this fashion we may finally run aground on rocks more perilous than those which at that time loomed before us?

	But in order that you may make a choice and come to a decision between the two constitutions, not from the summary statement you have just heard, but from exact knowledge, it behoves you, for your part, to render yourselves attentive to what I say, while I, for my part, shall try to explain them both to you as briefly as I can.

	For those who directed the state in the time of Solon and Cleisthenes did not establish a polity which in name merely was hailed as the most impartial and the mildest of governments, while in practice showing itself the opposite to those who lived under it, nor one which trained the citizens in such fashion that they looked upon insolence as democracy, lawlessness as liberty, impudence of speech as equality,

	[m1]\ [/m]
	But what contributed most to their good government of the state was that of the two recognized kinds of equality—that which makes the same award to all alike and that which gives to each man his due[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—they did not fail to grasp which was the more serviceable; but, rejecting as unjust that which holds that the good and the bad are worthy of the same honours, and preferring rather that which rewards and punishes every man according to his deserts, they governed the city on this principle, not filling the offices by lot from all the citizens,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] but selecting the best and the ablest for each function of the state; for they believed that the rest of the people would reflect the character of those who were placed in charge of their affairs.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Furthermore they considered that this way of appointing magistrates was also more democratic than the casting of lots, since under the plan of election by lot chance would decide the issue and the partizans of oligarchy would often get the offices; whereas under the plan of selecting the worthiest men, the people would have in their

	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]The method of electing the various magistrates changed
	from time to time, and is much less simple than Isocrates
	here represents it to be. For example, election of the chief magistrates, the archons, by lot (though from a previously selected group) is at least as old as Solon. On the other hand, in Isocrates’ day officers who had supervision over military and financial affairs were elected by “show of hands” in the General Assembly. See Gilbert, [c dimgray]Greek Constitutional Antiquities[/c] (Eng. trans.) pp. 216 ff. It seems clear, however, that after Cleisthenes all classes of citizens, the poor as well as the rich, became eligible to the offices (Plutarch, [c dimgray]Aristides[/c] 22) and that election by lot became increasingly a device to further pure democracy.

	hands the power to choose those who were most attached to the existing constitution.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The reason why this plan was agreeable to the majority and why they did not fight over the offices was because they had been schooled to be industrious and frugal, and not to neglect their own possessions and conspire against the possessions of others, and not to repair their own fortunes out of the public funds,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but rather to help out the commonwealth, should the need arise, from their private resources,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and not to know more accurately the incomes derived from the public offices than those which accrued to them from their own estates. So severely did they abstain from what belonged to the state that it was harder in those days to find men who were willing to hold office[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] than it is now to find men who are not begging for the privilege; for they did not regard a charge over public affairs as a chance for private gain but as a service to the state; neither did they from their first day in office seek to discover whether their predecessors had overlooked any source of profit, but much rather whether they had neglected any business of the state which pressed for settlement.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In a word, our forefathers had resolved that the people, as the supreme master of the state, should appoint the magistrates, call to account those who failed in their duty, and judge in cases of dispute; while those citizens who could afford

	Such was the constitution of their polity, and from this it is easy to see that also in their conduct day by day they never failed to act with propriety and justice; for when people have laid sound foundations for the conduct of the whole state it follows that in the details of their lives they must reflect the character of their government.

	First of all as to their conduct towards the gods—for it is right to begin with them[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]—they were not erratic or irregular in their worship of them or in the celebration of their rites; they did not, for example, drive three hundred oxen in procession to the altar,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] when it entered their heads to do so, while omitting, when the caprice seized them, the sacrifices instituted by their fathers;[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] neither did they observe on a grand scale the festivals imported

	from abroad,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] whenever these were attended by a feast, while contracting with the lowest bidder for the sacrifices demanded by the holiest rites of their religion. For their only care was not to destroy any institution of their fathers and to introduce nothing which was not approved by custom, believing that reverence consists, not in extravagant expenditures, but in disturbing none of the rites which their ancestors had handed on to them. And so also the gifts of the gods were visited upon them, not fitfully or capriciously, but seasonably both for the ploughing of the land and for the ingathering of its fruits.

	In the same manner also they governed their relations with each other. For not only were they of the same mind regarding public affairs, but in their private life as well they showed that degree of consideration for each other which is due from men who are right-minded and partners in a common fatherland. The less well-to-do among the citizens were so far from envying those of greater means that they were as solicitous for the great estates as for their own, considering that the prosperity of the rich was a guarantee of their own well-being. Those who possessed wealth, on the other hand, did not look down upon those in humbler circumstances, but, regarding poverty among their fellow-citizens as their own disgrace, came to the rescue of the distresses of the poor, handing over lands to some at moderate rentals, sending out some to engage in commerce, and furnishing means to others to enter upon various occupations; for they had no fear that they might suffer one of two things—that they might lose their whole investment or recover,

	after much trouble, only a mere fraction of their venture; on the contrary, they felt as secure about the money which was lent out as about that which was stored in their own coffers. For they saw that in cases of contract the judges were not in the habit of indulging their sense of equity[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but were strictly faithful to the laws; and that they did not in trying others seek to make it safe for themselves to disobey the law,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] but were indeed more severe on defaulters than were the injured themselves, since they believed that those who break down confidence in contracts do a greater injury to the poor than to the rich; for if the rich were to stop lending, they would be deprived of only a slight revenue, whereas if the poor should lack the help of their supporters they would be reduced to desperate straits. And so because of this confidence no one tried to conceal his wealth[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] nor hesitated to lend it out, but, on the contrary, the wealthy were better pleased to see men borrowing money than paying it back; for they thus experienced the double satisfaction—which should appeal to all right-minded men—of helping their fellow-citizens and at the same time making their own property productive for themselves. In fine, the result of their dealing honourably with each other was that the ownership of property was secured to those to whom it rightfully belonged, while the enjoyment of property was shared by all the citizens who needed it.

	life as they were in those days, but neglect to explain the reasons why our forefathers managed so well both in their relations with each other and in their government of the state. Well, I have already touched upon that question,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but in spite of that I shall now try to discuss it even more fully and more clearly.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Athenians of that day were not watched over by many preceptors[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] during their boyhood only to be allowed to do what they liked when they attained to manhood;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] on the contrary, they were subjected to greater supervision in the very prime of their vigour than when they were boys. For our forefathers placed such strong emphasis upon sobriety that they put the supervision of decorum in charge of the Council of the Areopagus[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]—a body which was composed exclusively of men who were of noble birth[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and had exemplified in their lives exceptional virtue and sobriety, and which, therefore, naturally excelled all the other councils of Hellas. And we may judge what this institution was at that time even by what happens at the present day; for even
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]In 20–27.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]See Plato ([c dimgray]Protagoras[/c] 325 c ff.) for a picture of the
	education of Athenian boys.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Literally, when they are approved for manhood. At
	the age of eighteen, the Athenian youth submitted himself
	to an examination on his qualifications for citizenship.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]In early times, the Council, according to Aristotle
	([c dimgray]Constitution of Athens[/c] 3), not only had the duty of
	guarding the laws, but was the main factor in the government
	of the city, and punished at its discretion “all who
	misbehaved themselves.” It even selected the magistrates
	for the several offices ([c dimgray]ib.[/c] 8). Under Solon the Council
	kept its most important powers: it superintended the laws
	and guarded the constitution, exercised a censorship over
	the citizens “in the most important matters,” and corrected
	offenders, having plenary authority to inflict punishment
	([c dimgray]ib.[/c]8). Under Cleisthenes its powers declined, but because
	of its wise and patriotic initiative in the Persian Wars it became again the supreme influence of the state ([c dimgray]ib.[/c] 23), and remained so until, under the leadership of Ephialtes, its important powers of supervision and censorship were taken from it and distributed to the Senate of the Five Hundred, the General Assembly, and the Heliastic juries ([c dimgray]ib.[/c] 25).
	[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]The Council was made up of ex-archons, who, after successfully passing an examination at the end of their terms of office to determine their fitness, became members of the Areopagus for life. The archons were at first “selected under qualifications of birth and of wealth.” See Aristotle, [c dimgray]Constitution of Athens[/c] 3. After the “reforms” of Ephialtes, the property qualification was dropped, the only requirement being that of genuine citizenship. See Plutarch, [c dimgray]Aristides.[/c]

	now, when everything connected with the election and the examination of magistrates[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] has fallen into neglect, we shall find that those who in all else that they do are insufferable, yet when they enter the Areopagus hesitate to indulge their true nature, being governed rather by its traditions than by their own evil instincts. So great was the fear which its members inspired in the depraved and such was the memorial of their own virtue and sobriety which they left behind them in the place of their assembly.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Such, then, as I have described, was the nature of the Council which our forefathers charged with the supervision of moral discipline.—a council which considered that those who believed that the best citizens are produced in a state where the laws are prescribed with the greatest exactness[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] were blind to the truth; for in that case there would be no reason why all of the Hellenes should not be on the same level, at any rate in so far as it is easy to borrow written codes from each other. But in fact, they thought, virtue is not advanced by written laws but by the habits of every-day life; for the majority of men tend to assimilate the manners and morals amid which they have been reared. Furthermore, they held that where there is a multitude of specific laws, it is a sign that the state is badly governed;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] for it is in the attempt to build up dikes against the spread of crime that

	They did, however, have to undergo an examination (εὔθυνα)
	on their conduct in office at the end of their term, and a
	further examination (δοκιμασία) before the Council of the
	Areopagus to determine their worthiness to become members
	of that body. See Gilbert, [c dimgray]Greek Constitutional Antiquities[/c] p. 282. What such an examination was like is described by Aristotle, [c dimgray]Constitution of Athens[/c] 55. Perhaps such examinations became largely perfunctory, and this may be the ground of Isocrates’ complaint.

	men in such a state feel constrained to multiply the laws. Those who are rightly governed, on the other hand, do not need to fill their porticoes[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] with written statutes, but only to cherish justice in their souls; for it is not by legislation, but by morals, that states are well directed, since men who are badly reared will venture to transgress even laws which are drawn up with minute exactness, whereas those who are well brought up will be willing to respect even a simple code.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Therefore, being of this mind, our forefathers did not seek to discover first how they should penalize men who were lawless, but how they should produce citizens who would refrain from any punishable act; for they thought that this was their duty, while it was proper for private enemies alone to be zealous in the avenging of crime.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	Now our forefathers exercised care over all the citizens, but most of all over the young.

	However, since it was not possible to direct all into the same occupations, because of differences in their circumstances, they assigned to each one a vocation which was in keeping with his means; for they turned the needier towards farming and trade, knowing

On the other hand, they compelled those who possessed sufficient means to devote themselves to horsemanship,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] athletics,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] hunting,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and philosophy,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] observing that by these pursuits some are enabled to achieve excellence, others to abstain from many vices.

	But when they had laid down these ordinances they were not negligent regarding what remained to be done, but, dividing the city into districts and the country into townships, they kept watch over the life of every citizen,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] haling the disorderly before the Council, which now rebuked, now warned, and again punished them according to their deserts. For they understood that there are two ways both of encouraging men to do wrong and of checking them from evil-doing; for where no watch is kept over such matters and the judgements are not strict, there even honest natures grow corrupt; but where, again, it is not easy for wrong-doers either to escape detection or, when detected, to obtain indulgence, there the impulse to do evil disappears. Understanding this, they restrained the people from wrong-doing in both ways—both by punishment and by watchfulness; for

	so far from failing to detect those who had gone astray, they actually saw in advance who were likely to commit some offence. Therefore the young men did not waste their time in the gambling-dens or with the flute-girls or in the kind of company in which they now spend their days,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but remained steadfastly in the pursuits to which they had been assigned, admiring and emulating those who excelled in these. And so strictly did they avoid the market-place that even when they were at times compelled to pass through it, they were seen to do this with great modesty and sobriety of manner.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] To contradict one’s elders or to be impudent to them[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] was then considered more reprehensible than it is nowadays to sin against one’s parents; and to eat or drink in a tavern was something which no one, not even an honest slave, would venture to do;[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] for they cultivated the manners of a gentleman, not those of a buffoon; and as for those who had a turn for jesting and playing the clown, whom we to-day speak of as clever wits, they were then looked upon as sorry fools.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]

	this spirit of heedlessness and destroyed the power of the Areopagus. For while this Council maintained its authority, Athens was not rife with law-suits,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] or accusations,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] or tax-levies,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] or poverty,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] or war; on the contrary, her citizens lived in accord with each other and at peace with mankind, enjoying the good will of the Hellenes and inspiring fear in the barbarians; for they had saved the Hellenes from destruction and had punished the barbarians so severely that the latter were well content if only they might suffer no further injury.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And so, because of these things, our forefathers lived in such a degree of security that the houses and establishments in the country were finer and more costly than those within the city-walls,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] and many of the people never visited Athens even for the festivals, preferring to remain at home in the enjoyment of their own possessions rather than share in the pleasures dispensed by the state. For even the public festivals, which might otherwise have drawn many to the city, were not conducted with extravagance or ostentation, but with sane moderation, since our people then measured their well-being, not by their processions or by their efforts to outdo each other in fitting out the choruses,[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] or by any such empty shows, but by the sobriety of their government,

	These are the standards by which one should judge whether people are genuinely prosperous and not living in vulgar fashion. For as things now are, who among intelligent men can fail to be chagrined at what goes on, when we see many of our fellow-citizens drawing lots in front of the law-courts to determine whether they themselves shall have the necessaries of life,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] yet thinking it proper to support at their expense any of the Hellenes who will deign to row their ships;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] appearing in the public choruses in garments spangled with gold, yet living through the winter in clothing which I refuse to describe; and showing other contradictions of the same kind in their conduct of affairs, which bring great shame upon the city?

	Nothing of the sort happened when the Areopagus was in power; for it delivered the poor from want by providing them with work and with assistance from the wealthy, the young from excesses by engaging them in occupations and by watching over them, the men in public life from the temptations of greed by imposing punishments and by letting no wrong-doer escape detection, and the older men from despondency by securing to them public honours and the devotion of the young.

	I have now discussed most of the features of the constitution as it once was, and those which I have passed over may readily be judged from those which I have described, since they are of the same character. However, certain people who have heard me discuss this constitution, while praising it most unreservedly and agreeing that our forefathers were fortunate in having governed the state in this fashion, have nevertheless expressed the opinion that you could not be persuaded to adopt it, but that, because you have grown accustomed to the present order, you would prefer to continue a wretched existence under it rather than enjoy a better life under a stricter polity; and they warned me that I even ran the risk, although giving you the very best advice, of being thought an enemy of the people and of seeking to turn the state into an oligarchy.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

I have, however, proposed nothing of the kind, but have been discussing a government whose character is hidden from no one, but evident to all—one which, as you all know, is a heritage from our fathers, which has been the source of numberless blessings both to Athens and to the other states of Hellas, and which was, besides, ordained and established by men who

	would be acknowledged by all the world to have been the best friends of the people[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] among the citizens of Athens; so that it would be of all things most absurd if I, in seeking to introduce such a polity, should be suspected of favouring revolution.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Furthermore, it is easy to judge of my purpose from the fact that in most of the discourses[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] which I have written, you will find that I condemn oligarchies and special privileges, while I commend equal rights and democratic governments—not all of them, but those which are well-ordered, praising them not indiscriminately, but on just and reasonable grounds. For I know that under this constitution our ancestors were far superior to the rest of the world, and that the Lacedaemonians are the best governed of peoples because they are the most democratic;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] for in their selection of magistrates, in their daily life, and in their habits in general, we may see that the principles of equity and equality have greater influence than elsewhere in the world—principles to which oligarchies are hostile, while well-ordered democracies practise them continually.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Moreover, if we will examine into the history of the most illustrious and the greatest of the other states, we shall find that democratic forms of government are more advantageous for them than oligarchies. For if we compare our own government—which is criticized by everyone[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]—not with the old democracy which I have described, but with the rule which was instituted by the Thirty,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] there is no one who would not consider our present democracy

And I desire, even though some will complain that I am straying from my subject, to expound and to explain how much superior this government is to that of the Thirty, in order that I may not be accused of scrutinizing too minutely the mistakes of our democracy, while overlooking the many fine things which it has achieved.

	and who of my own generation does not remember that the democracy so adorned the city with temples and public buildings that even to-day visitors from other lands consider that she is worthy to rule not only over Hellas but over all the world;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] while the Thirty neglected the public buildings, plundered the temples, and sold for destruction for the sum of three talents the dockyards[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] upon which the city had spent not less than a thousand talents? And surely no one could find grounds to praise the mildness[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] of the Thirty as against that of the people’s rule! For when the Thirty took over the city, by vote of the Assembly,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] they put to death fifteen hundred Athenians[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] without a trial and compelled more than five thousand to leave Athens and take refuge in the Piraeus,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] whereas when the exiles overcame them and returned to Athens under arms, these put to death only the chief perpetrators of their wrongs and dealt so generously and so justly by the rest[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] that those who had driven the citizens from their homes fared no worse than those who had returned from exile. But the best and strongest proof of the fairness of the people is that, although those who had remained in the city had borrowed a hundred talents from the Lacedaemonians[c dimgray][sup]h[/sup][/c] with which to prosecute the siege of those who occupied the Piraeus, yet later when an assembly of the people was held to consider the payment of the debt, and

	when many insisted that it was only fair that the claims of the Lacedaemonians should be settled, not by those who had suffered the siege, but by those who had borrowed the money, nevertheless the people voted to pay the debt out of the public treasury.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] And in truth it was because of this spirit that they brought us into such concord with each other and so far advanced the power of the city that the Lacedaemonians, who under the rule of the oligarchy laid their commands upon us almost every day, under the rule of the people came begging and supplicating us not to allow them to be driven from their homes.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] In a word the spirit of the two parties was this: the oligarchies were minded to rule over their fellow-citizens and be subject to their enemies; the people, to rule over the world at large and share the power of the state on equal terms with their fellow-citizens.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I have recounted these things for two reasons: because I wanted to show, in the first place, that I am not in favour of oligarchy or special privilege, but of a just and orderly government of the people, and, in the second place, that even badly constituted democracies are responsible for fewer disasters than are oligarchies, while those which are well-ordered are superior to oligarchies in that they are more just, more impartial, and more agreeable to those who live under them.

	now eulogized democracy in such high terms, I veer about capriciously and criticize and condemn the present order. Well, I reproach men in private life when they succeed in a few things and fail in many, and regard them as falling short of what they ought to be; and, more than that, when men are sprung from noble ancestors and yet are only a little better than those who are distinguished for depravity, and much worse than their fathers, I rebuke them and would counsel them to cease from being what they are. And I am of the same mind also regarding public affairs. For I think that we ought not to be proud or even satisfied should we have shown ourselves more law-regarding than men accursed by the gods and afflicted with madness,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but ought much rather to feel aggrieved and resentful should we prove to be worse than our ancestors; for it is their excellence and not the depravity of the Thirty which we should strive to emulate, especially since it behoves Athenians to be the best among mankind.

	This is not the first time that I have expressed this sentiment; I have done so many times and before many people. For I know that while other regions produce varieties of fruits and trees and animals, each peculiar to its locality and much better than those of other lands, our own country is able to bear and nurture men who are not only the most gifted in the world in the arts and in the powers of action and of speech, but are also above all others in valour and in virtue.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	Amazons and the Thracians and all of the Peloponnesians, and also from the wars which they waged against the Persians, in which, both when they fought alone and when they were aided by the Peloponnesians, whether on land or on the sea, they were victorious over the barbarians and were adjudged the meed of valour;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] for they could not have achieved these things, had they not far surpassed other men in the endowments of nature.

	But let no one think that this eulogy is appropriate to those who compose the present government—far from it; for such words are a tribute to those who show themselves worthy of the valour of their forefathers, but a reproach to those who disgrace their noble origin by their slackness and their cowardice. And this is just what we are doing; for you shall have the truth. For although we were blessed with such a nature at our birth, we have not cherished and preserved it, but have, on the contrary, fallen into folly and confusion and lust after evil ways.

	waging war and living and faring and acting in almost every respect just as we do at the present moment and have done in the past; but if we effect a change of polity, it is evident by the same reasoning that such conditions of life as our ancestors enjoyed will come about for us also; for from the same political institutions there must always spring like or similar ways of life.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But we must take the most significant of these ways and, comparing one with the other, decide which is preferable for us. And first let us consider how the Hellenes and the barbarians felt towards the earlier polity as compared with how they are now disposed towards us; for other peoples contribute not the least part of our well-being when they are properly disposed towards us. Well then, the Hellenes felt such confidence in those who governed the city in those times that most of them of their own accord placed themselves under the power of Athens,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] while the barbarians were so far from meddling in the affairs of the Hellenes that they neither sailed their ships-of-war this side of the Phaselis nor marched their armies beyond the Halys River, refraining, on the contrary, from all aggression.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] To-day, however, circumstances are so completely reversed that the Hellenes regard Athens with hatred and the barbarians hold us in contempt. As to the hatred of us among the Hellenes, you have heard the report of our generals[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] themselves, and what the King thinks of us, he has made plain in the letters which have been dispatched by him.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	Furthermore, under the discipline of the old days the citizens were so schooled in virtue as not to injure each other, but to fight and conquer all who attempted to invade their territory.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] We, however, do the very opposite; for we never let a day go by without bringing trouble on each other, and we have so far neglected the business of war that we do not even deign to attend reviews unless we are paid money for doing so. But the greatest difference lies in the fact that in that day no one of the citizens lacked the necessaries of life nor shamed the city by begging from passers-by, whereas to-day those who are destitute of means outnumber those who possess them.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] And we may well be patient with people in such circumstances if they care nothing for the public welfare, but consider only how they may live from day to day.

	[b]Against the Sophists[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The tract against the sophists was written, as Isocrates himself tells us in the [c dimgray]Antidosis[/c],[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] at the outset of his career as a teacher,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and was no doubt issued as an advertisement of the principles and methods of his school. It breaks off, however, just at the point where he proceeds to a more positive exposition of his “philosophy.”[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] The fragment which has come down to us is mainly an attack upon other systems of education, with barest hints as to his own, and it seems obvious that the purpose of the whole discourse was to set the author sharply apart from the other sophists, with whom he does not wish to be confused.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For a more complete discussion both of his own and other disciplines we must go to the [c dimgray]Antidosis[/c]. Here his criticism is centred upon two classes of sophists, the [c dimgray]Eristics[/c], who devoted themselves to theorizing in the field of ethics, and the sophists of the rhetorical school, who taught oratory as an instrument of practical success. Of these latter he singles out, finally, for special rebuke the authors of “the so-called arts” (of oratory).

	Both classes are called to account because of their impossible pretensions: the former for professing to teach an exact science of happy and successful living and then indulging in captious logomachies which have no relation to life; the latter for professing to teach the science or art of oratory as if it could be acquired by anyone by rote, regardless of native ability or practical experience, as one learns the letters of the alphabet. Furthermore, the authors of the “arts” might have devoted themselves to a worthy oratory whose end is justice, whereas in fact they emphasized only forensic skill, whose object is to defeat justice.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	If all who are engaged in the profession of education were willing to state the facts instead of making greater promises than they can possibly fulfil, they would not be in such bad repute with the lay-public. As it is, however, the teachers who do not scruple to vaunt their powers with utter disregard of the truth have created the impression that those who choose a life of careless indolence are better advised than those who devote themselves to serious study.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Indeed, who can fail to abhor, yes to contemn, those teachers, in the first place, who devote themselves to disputation,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] since they pretend to search for truth, but straightway at the beginning of their professions attempt to deceive us with lies?[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] For I think it is manifest to all that foreknowledge of future events is not vouchsafed to our human nature, but that we are so far removed from this prescience[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Isocrates regards himself as one of the sophists (see
	[c dimgray]Antid.[/c] 220), but sets himself apart from the “common
	herd” of sophists (see [c dimgray]Panath.[/c] 18).
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Captious argumentation in the field of ethics. He is
	not thinking of Socrates, who did not teach for pay, nor of
	Plato’s dialectic, which was not yet famous, but of the
	minor Socratics, especially Antisthenes and Eucleides, who
	taught for money while affecting contempt for it. In general
	he is thinking of such quibblers as are later shown up in
	Plato’s [c dimgray]Euthydemus.[/c] See General Introd. pp. xxi ff.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]Theirs is a cloud morality, not truth to live by on
	earth. [c dimgray]Cf.[/c] 20. See General Introd. p. xxii.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]There is, according to Isocrates, no “science” which can teach us to do under all circumstances the things which will insure our happiness and success. Life is too complicated for that, and no man can foresee exactly the consequences of his acts—“the future is a thing unseen.” All that education can do is to develop a sound judgement (as opposed to knowledge) which will meet the contingencies of life with resourcefulness and, in most cases, with success. This is a fundamental doctrine of his “philosophy” which he emphasizes and echoes again and again in opposition to the professors of a “science of virtue and happiness.” See General Introd. pp. xxvii ff.

	But these professors have gone so far in their lack of scruple that they attempt to persuade our young men that if they will only study under them they will know what to do in life and through this knowledge will become happy and prosperous. More than that, although they set themselves up as masters and dispensers of goods so precious, they are not ashamed of asking for them a price of three or four minae![c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Why, if they were to sell any other commodity for so trifling a fraction of its worth they would not deny their folly; nevertheless, although they set so insignificant a price on the whole stock of virtue and happiness, they pretend to wisdom and assume the right to instruct the rest of the world. Furthermore, although they say that they do not want money and speak contemptuously of wealth as “filthy lucre,” they hold their hands out for a trifling gain and promise to make their disciples all but immortal![c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] But what is most ridiculous of all is that they distrust those from whom they are to get this money—they distrust, that is to say, the very men to whom they are about to deliver the science of just dealing—and they require that the fees advanced by their students be

For it is permissible to those who give any other instruction to be exacting in matters open to dispute, since nothing prevents those who have been made adept in other lines of training from being dishonourable in the matter of contracts. But men who inculcate virtue and sobriety—is it not absurd if they do not trust in their own students before all others?[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] For it is not to be supposed that men who are honourable and just-dealing with others will be dishonest with the very preceptors who have made them what they are.

	When, therefore, the layman puts all these things together and observes that the teachers of wisdom and dispensers of happiness are themselves in great want[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] but exact only a small fee from their students, that they are on the watch for contradictions in words[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] but are blind to inconsistencies in deeds, and that, furthermore, they pretend to have knowledge of the future but are incapable either of saying anything pertinent or of giving any counsel regarding the present, and when he observes that those who follow their judgements are more consistent and more successful[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] than those who profess to have exact knowledge, then he has, I think, good reason to contemn such studies and regard them as stuff and nonsense, and not as a true discipline of the soul.

	But it is not these sophists alone who are open to criticism, but also those who profess to teach political discourse.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For the latter have no interest whatever in the truth,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] but consider that they are masters of an art if they can attract great numbers of students by the smallness of their charges and the magnitude of their professions and get something out of them. For they are themselves so stupid and conceive others to be so dull that, although the speeches which they compose are worse than those which some laymen improvise, nevertheless they promise to make their students such clever orators that they will not overlook any of the possibilities which a subject affords. More than that, they do not attribute any of this power either to the practical experience or to the native ability of the student, but undertake to transmit the science of discourse as simply as they would teach the letters of the alphabet,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] not having taken trouble to examine into the nature of each kind of knowledge, but thinking that because of the extravagance of their promises they themselves will command admiration and the teaching of discourse will be held in higher esteem—oblivious of the fact that the arts are made great, not by those who are without scruple in boasting about them, but by those who are able to discover all of the resources which each art affords.

	But I marvel when I observe these men setting themselves up as instructors of youth who cannot see that they are applying the analogy of an art with hard and fast rules to a creative process. For, excepting these teachers, who does not know that the art of using letters remains fixed and unchanged, so that we continually and invariably use the same letters for the same purposes, while exactly the reverse is true of the art of discourse?[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] For what has been said by one speaker is not equally useful for the speaker who comes after him; on the contrary, he is accounted most skilled in this art who speaks in a manner worthy of his subject and yet is able to discover in it topics which are nowise the same as those used by others. But the greatest proof of the difference between these two arts is that oratory is good only if it has the qualities of fitness for the occasion,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] propriety of style, and originality of treatment, while in the case of letters there is no such need whatsoever. So that those who make use of such analogies ought more justly to pay out than to accept fees, since they attempt to teach others when they are themselves in great need of instruction.

	all intelligent people will agree with me that while many of those who have pursued philosophy have remained in private life,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] others, on the other hand, who have never taken lessons from any one of the sophists have become able orators and statesmen. For ability, whether in speech or in any other activity, is found in those who are well endowed by nature and have been schooled by practical experience.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Formal training makes such men more skilful and more resourceful in discovering the possibilities of a subject; for it teaches them to take from a readier source the topics which they otherwise hit upon in haphazard fashion. But it cannot fully fashion men who are without natural aptitude into good debaters or writers, although it is capable of leading them on to self-improvement and to a greater degree of intelligence on many subjects.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I desire, now that I have gone this far, to speak more clearly on these matters. For I hold that to obtain a knowledge of the elements out of which we make and compose all discourses is not so very difficult if anyone entrusts himself, not to those who make rash promises, but to those who have some knowledge of these things. But to choose from these elements those which should be employed for each subject, to join them together, to arrange them properly, and also, not to miss what the occasion demands but appropriately to adorn the whole speech with striking thoughts and to clothe it in flowing and melodious phrase[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]—these things, I hold, require much study and are the task

	of a vigorous and imaginative mind:[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] for this, the student must not only have the requisite aptitude but he must learn the different kinds of discourse and practise himself in their use; and the teacher, for his part, must so expound the principles of the art with the utmost possible exactness as to leave out nothing that can be taught, and, for the rest, he must in himself set such an example of oratory that the students who have taken form under his instruction and are able to pattern after him will, from the outset, show in their speaking a degree of grace and charm which is not found in others. When all of these requisites are found together, then the devotees of philosophy will achieve complete success; but according as any one of the things which I have mentioned is lacking, to this extent must their disciples of necessity fall below the mark.

	Now as for the sophists who have lately sprung up and have very recently embraced these pretensions,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] even though they flourish at the moment, they will all, I am sure, come round to this position. But there remain to be considered those who lived before our time and did not scruple to write the so-called arts of oratory.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] These must not be dismissed without rebuke, since they professed to teach how to conduct law-suits, picking out the most discredited of terms,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] which the enemies, not the champions, of this discipline might have been expected to employ—and that too although this facility, in so far as it can be taught, is of no greater aid to

But they were much worse than those who dabble in disputation; for although the latter expounded such captious theories that were anyone to cleave to them in practice he would at once be in all manner of trouble, they did, at any rate, make professions of virtue and sobriety in their teaching, whereas the former, although exhorting others to study political discourse, neglected all the good things which this study affords, and became nothing more than professors of meddlesomeness and greed.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And yet those who desire to follow the true precepts of this discipline may, if they will, be helped more speedily towards honesty of character[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] than towards facility in oratory. And let no one suppose that I claim that just living can be taught;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] for, in a word, I hold that there does not exist an art of the kind which can implant sobriety and justice in depraved natures. Nevertheless, I do think that the study of political discourse can help more than any other thing to stimulate and form such qualities of character.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But in order that I may not appear to be breaking down the pretensions of others while myself making greater claims than are within my powers, I believe that the very arguments by which I myself was convinced will make it clear to others also that these things are true.

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The wealthier citizens of Athens were required by law to bear the expense of public services known as “liturgies.”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] One of these was the “trierarchy”—that of fitting out a ship of war. Anyone allotted to such a duty might challenge another to accept the alternative of either undertaking this burden in his stead or of exchanging property with him. Such a challenge was called an “antidosis.” If the challenged party objected, the issue was adjudicated by a court.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It seems clear that Isocrates had undergone such a trial and had been condemned to undertake a trierarchy. The plaintiff had probably prejudiced the case by misrepresenting Isocrates’ wealth, his character, and the influence of his teaching. What Isocrates’ defence was we do not know, but it seems likely that he did not take the trial very seriously until the unfavourable verdict opened his eyes to the fact that he was generally misunderstood. Then he conceived the idea of dissipating this prejudice against him by publishing in the form of a defence in court “a true image of his thought and of his whole life.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At any rate, in the [c dimgray]Antidosis[/c]—a title which he borrows from the actual suit to which he had just

	been subjected—he adopts the fiction of a capital charge brought against him by an informer, named Lysimachus, and of a trial before a court with its accessories.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] The fictitious charge is, roughly, that he is guilty of corrupting his pupils by teaching them to make the worse reason appear the better and so to win their advantage contrary to justice,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] which is the stock complaint against the sophists, and the one which was pressed against Socrates. Indeed, it is clear that Isocrates had the latter’s trial in mind and that he studiously echoes the defence of Socrates as it is recorded by Plato in the [c dimgray]Apology[/c].[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The defence of Isocrates is, however, more discursive than that of Socrates or, indeed, than any defence appropriate to an actual trial, as he himself points out.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] It is, on the negative side, a sharp attack upon the Athenian populace for confusing him with the other sophists and for allowing demagogic politicians to use against him the general prejudice which had accumulated against the sophists as a class; and it is, at the same time, a criticism—not too gracious—of the narrowness or the impracticableness of the teaching of his rivals and of their failure to appreciate at its full value the broad and useful culture for which he himself stood. On its positive side, it is a definition and, to a certain extent, an exposition of the culture or “philosophy”[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] which Isocrates professed. In this respect,

	If the discourse which is now about to be read[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] had been like the speeches which are produced either for the law-courts[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] or for oratorical display,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] I should not, I suppose, have prefaced it by any explanation. Since, however, it is novel and different in character, it is necessary to begin by setting forth the reasons why I chose to write a discourse so unlike any other; for if I neglected to make this clear, my speech would, no doubt, impress many as curious and strange.

	Indeed, I had always thought, until well on in years, that, owing to this choice and to my retired life in general,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] I stood fairly well in the opinion of all the lay public. Then when my career was near its close, having been challenged to an exchange of property on the question of a trierarchy, and subjected to a trial on that issue, I came to realize that even outside of my profession there were those who were not disposed towards me as I had thought; nay, that some had been absolutely misled as to my pursuits and were inclined to listen to my detractors, while others, who were well aware of the nature of my work, were envious, feeling the same towards me as do the sophists, and rejoiced to see people hold false opinions of my character. They betrayed their sentiments at the trial; for, although my opponent made no argument whatever on the merits of the case, and did nothing but decry my “cleverness” of speech[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and indulge in extravagant nonsense about my wealth and the number of my pupils, they imposed the trierarchy upon me.

	by such things nor altogether reckless or even careless about money. But when my eyes were opened, as I have said, to the fact that a greater number than I supposed had mistaken ideas about me, I began to ponder how I could show to them and to posterity the truth about my character, my life, and the education to which I am devoted, and not suffer myself to be condemned on these issues without a trial nor to remain, as I had just been, at the mercy of my habitual calumniators. And as I kept thinking upon it, I came ever to the same conclusion, namely, that the only way in which I could accomplish this was to compose a discourse which would be, as it were, a true image of my thought and of my whole life; for I hoped that this would serve both as the best means of making known the truth about me and, at the same time, as a monument, after my death, more noble than statues of bronze.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

For, I assure you, it has not been an easy nor a simple task, but one of great difficulty; for while some things in my discourse are appropriate to be spoken in a court-room, others are out of place amid such controversies, being frank discussions about philosophy and expositions of its power. There is in it, also, matter which it would be well for young men to hear before they set out to gain knowledge and an education; and there is much, besides, of what I have written in the past, inserted in the present discussion, not without reason nor without fitness, but with due appropriateness to the subject in hand.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now to view as a whole so great an extent of subject matter, to harmonize and bring together so many diverse varieties of discourse, to connect smoothly what follows with what goes before, and to make all parts consonant one with another, was by no means an easy undertaking. Yet I did not desist, in spite of my age, until I had accomplished it, such as it is. It is, at any rate, written with devotion to the truth; its other qualities I leave to the judgement of my hearers. But I urge all who intend to acquaint themselves with my speech, first, to make allowance, as they listen to it, for the fact that it is a mixed discourse, composed with an eye to all these subjects; next, to fix their attention

	These, then, are the things which it was necessary for me to say by way of introduction. I beg you now to listen to my defence, which purports to have been written for a trial, but whose real purpose is to show the truth about myself, to make those who are ignorant about me know the sort of man I am and those who are afflicted with envy suffer a still more painful attack of this malady; for a greater revenge upon them than this I could not hope to obtain.

	I consider that in all the world there are none so depraved and so deserving of the severest punishment as those who have the audacity to charge others with the offences of which they themselves are guilty. And this is the very thing that Lysimachus has done. For this informer, himself delivering a composed speech, has said more in complaint of my compositions than upon all other points; it is as if one were to charge another with breaking into a temple, while showing in his own hands plunder stolen from the gods. I would give much if he really thought that I am as “clever” as he has made me out to be to you, for then he would never have tried to trouble me.

	my powers that he is confident that he with his lies will win against me and the truth. And so maliciously has everything conspired against me, that while others may depend on their power of speech to make an end of calumnies, it is, in my case, just this power of speech which Lysimachus has most calumniated, in order that if I shall appear to speak well, I may show that I am subject to the charges which he has made about my cleverness; while if it turns out that I speak less ably than he has led you to expect, you may think that mine is the weaker cause.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I beg you, then, neither to credit nor to discredit what has been said to you until you have heard to the end what I also have to say, bearing it in mind that there would have been no need of granting to the accused the right of making a defence, had it been possible to reach a just verdict from the arguments of the accuser. At this stage of the case no one here present is in any doubt whether the accuser has spoken well or badly, but it is not yet easy for the jury to decide from what the first speaker has said whether he has based his arguments on the truth; nay, they will be fortunate if they are able to draw a just conclusion from the arguments of both sides.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I do not wonder that men spend more time in denouncing those who attempt to deceive the jury than upon their own defence, nor that they complain that calumny is our greatest bane. What, indeed, could work greater mischief? It causes liars to be looked on with respect, innocent men to be regarded as criminals, and judges to violate their oaths; in a word, it smothers truth, and pouring false ideas

	into our ears, it leaves no man among our citizens secure from an unjust death. You must be on your guard against this and take care that nothing of the sort happens in this case and that you are not yourselves seen to fall into the very faults which you find reprehensible in others. I think you know well enough that time and again in the past Athens has so deeply repented[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] the judgements which have been pronounced in passion and without proof that not long after the events she has become eager to punish her deceivers, and would gladly have seen the victims of calumny in happier circumstances than before.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You should remember this and not trust too hastily the assertions of the accuser nor hear the defendant in uproar and anger.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Ours is a shameful state of inconsistency; for while it is acknowledged that in our life in general we are the most merciful[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and gentle of all the Hellenes, yet in the conduct of our trials here we manifestly give the lie to this reputation. In other states, when they try a man for his life, they cast a portion of the votes for the defendant,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] but with us the accused has not even an equal chance with the sycophants;[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] nay, while

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The outstanding instance is the decree passed by the

	process of law, the Athenian generals who were in command
	at the battle of Arginusae. After the execution of the
	sentence, the people repented of their haste and called to
	account the leading instigators of this irregular procedure.

	we take our solemn oath at the beginning of each year that we will hear impartially both accusers and accused, we depart so far from this in practice, that when the accuser makes his charges we give ear to whatever he may say; but when the accused endeavours to refute them, we sometimes do not endure even to hear his voice.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Those states in which an occasional citizen is put to death without a trial we condemn as unfit to live in, yet are blind to the fact that we are in the same case when we do not hear with equal good will both sides of the contest. But what is most absurd of all is the fact that when one of us is on trial, he denounces the calumniators, but when he sits in judgement upon another, he is no longer of the same mind regarding them. Yet, surely, intelligent men ought to be such when they are judges of others, as they would expect others to be to them in like case, bearing in mind the fact that because of the audacity of the sycophants it is impossible to foresee what man may be placed in peril and be compelled to plead, even as I am now doing, before men who are to decide his fate by their votes.

	Here in the indictment my accuser endeavours to vilify me, charging that I corrupt young men[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] by teaching them to speak and gain their own advantage in the courts contrary to justice, while in his speech he makes me out to be a man whose equal has never been known either among those who hang about the law-courts or among the devotees of philosophy; for he declares that I have had as my pupils not only private persons but orators, generals, kings, and despots;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and that I have received from them and am now receiving enormous sums of money. He has made his accusation in this manner, thinking that his extravagant assertions about me and my wealth and the great number of my pupils would arouse the envy of all his hearers, while my alleged activities in the law-courts would stir up your anger and hate; and when judges are affected by these very passions, they are most severe upon those who are on trial.

	However, in the one charge he has grossly exaggerated the facts and in the other he lies outright, as I think I can easily show. Let me ask you, however, not to pay any attention to what you have heard about me in the past from my would-be slanderers and calumniators, not to credit charges which have been made without proof or trial, and not to be influenced by the suspicions which have been maliciously implanted in you by my enemies, but to judge me to be the kind of man which the accusation and the defence in this trial will show me to be; for if you decide the case on this basis, you will have the credit of judging honourably and in accordance with the law, while I, for my part, shall obtain my complete deserts.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now, in fact, no citizen has ever been harmed either by my “cleverness” or by my writings, and I think the most convincing proof of this is furnished by this trial; for if any man had been wronged by me, even though he might have held his tongue up till now, he would not have neglected the present opportunity, but would have come forward to denounce me or bear witness against me. For when one who has never in his life heard a single disparaging word from me has put me in so great peril, depend upon it, had any suffered injury at my hands, they would now attempt to have their revenge.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For surely it is neither probable nor possible both that I, on the one hand, have wronged many people and that those, on the other hand, who have been visited with misfortune through me are silent and refrain from accusing me; nay, are kinder to me when my life is in peril than those

	If, therefore, I were to agree with my accuser and concede his claim that I am the “cleverest” of men and that I have never had an equal as a writer of the kind of speeches which are offensive to you, it would be much more just to give me credit for being an honest man than to punish me; for when a man has superior talents whether for speech or for action, one cannot fairly charge it to anything but fortune, but when a man makes good and temperate use of the power which nature has given him, as in my own case, all the world ought in justice to commend his character.

So, from what my accuser has himself said, it is easy for you to conclude that I have nothing to do with litigation. Nay, everyone is aware of this also, that there is a superabundance of men who produce speeches for litigants in the courts. Nevertheless you will not find that any one of them, numerous as they are, has ever been thought worthy to have pupils, while I, as my accuser states, have had more than all the rest together who are occupied with philosophy.

	in the courts, I believe that the quickest way to disabuse your mind of this confusion would be to show that people do not study under me what my accuser says they do, and that I am not clever at the kind of oratory which has to do with private disputes. For I think, now that the charge under which I formerly laboured has been disproved, you are anxious to change your attitude and want to hear from me what sort of eloquence it is which has occupied me and given me so great a reputation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Whether, indeed, it is going to profit me to speak the truth, I am not sure; for it is hard to conjecture what is in your thoughts. Yet, for all that, I am going to speak to you absolutely without reserve. For I should blush before my associates, if, after having told them again and again that I should be glad to have everyone of my fellow-citizens know the life I lead and the speeches which I compose, I did not now lay them open before you, but appeared rather to attempt to hide them away. Be assured, therefore, that you shall hear from me the whole truth, and in this spirit give me your attention.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	First of all, then, you should know that there are no fewer branches of composition in prose than in verse. For some men have devoted their lives to researches in the genealogies of the demi-gods; others have made studies in the poets; others have elected to compose histories of wars; while still others have occupied themselves with dialogue,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and are called dialecticians. It would, however, be no slight task to attempt to enumerate all the forms of prose, and I shall take up only that which is pertinent to me, and ignore the rest.

	For there are men who, albeit they are not strangers to the branches which I have mentioned, have chosen rather to write discourses, not for private disputes, but which deal with the world of Hellas, with affairs of state, and are appropriate to be delivered at the Pan-Hellenic assemblies—discourses which, as everyone will agree, are more akin to works composed in rhythm and set to music than to the speeches which are made in court. For they set forth facts in a style more imaginative and more ornate; they employ thoughts which are more lofty and more original, and, besides, they use throughout figures of speech in greater number and of more striking character.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	All men take as much pleasure in listening to this kind of prose as in listening to poetry, and many desire to take lessons in it, believing that those who excel in this field are wiser and better and of more use to the world than men who speak well in court. For they know that while the latter owe to a capacity for intrigue their expertness in forensic debate, the former have drawn from their pursuit of wisdom the eloquence which I have described; that while those who are thought to be adept in court procedure are tolerated only for the day when they are engaged in the trial, the devotees of philosophy are honoured and held in high esteem in every society and at all times; that, furthermore, while the former come to be despised and decried as soon as they are seen two or three times in court, the latter are admired more and more as they become better and more widely known; and, finally, that while clever pleaders are sadly unequal to the higher eloquence, the exponents of the latter could, if they so desired,

	Now you have heard the whole truth about my power, my philosophy, my profession, or whatever you care to call it.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] However, I want to set up for myself a more difficult standard than for other people, and to make a proposition which may seem over-rash for my years.

If, however, I were being tried for some criminal act, I should not have been able to produce the act itself before your eyes but you would have had to conjecture the facts from what I said and pass judgement as best you might.

I cannot, however, present them all in complete form; for the time which has been allowed me is too short.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But just as is done with fruits, I shall try to produce a sample of each kind. For when you have heard a small portion of them you will easily recognize my true character and appreciate the force of all my speeches.

	But I beg those of you who have read many times what you are now about to hear, not to expect new discourses from me on the present occasion nor think me burdensome because I repeat what has long been the talk of Athens. For if I were to repeat my orations in order to display my powers,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] I should reasonably be liable to this complaint; but now that I am on trial and in jeopardy I have no choice but to use my speeches in this fashion. For it would be the height of absurdity if in a case where my accuser denounces me for writing the kind of speeches which both hurt our city and corrupt our youth I used other speeches in my defence, when I can clear my name of the calumnies which are being heaped upon it by producing before you the very discourses of which he complains.

	I ask of you, then, for these reasons to bear with me and to lend me your support. But for the benefit of the others on the jury[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] I shall attempt to proceed with my selections, after a further word of explanation to enable them to follow more easily what is said.

	The discourse which is to be submitted to you first was written at the time when the Lacedaemonians were the first power in Hellas, while our fortunes were at low ebb. In it I summon the Hellenes to make an expedition against the barbarians, and I dispute the right of the Lacedaemonians to take the lead. Developing this theme, I show that Athens has been author of all the advantages which the Hellenes now enjoy. Then, having concluded the account of these benefactions, and desiring to show more convincingly that leadership in the expedition is the right of Athens, I further try to prove that far greater honour is due to her for the perils she has faced in war than for her other benefactions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now I thought that I should be able to go through these passages myself, but I find that my age hampers me and causes me to give out easily. So then, in order that I may not break down utterly while there are still many things which I must say, let the clerk begin at the place marked and read the passage on the hegemony.

	As to the hegemony, then, it is easy enough for you to make up your minds from what has been read to you that it should by right belong to Athens. But, I beg of you, consider well whether I appear to you to corrupt the young by my words, or, on the contrary, to inspire them to a life of valour and of dangers endured for their country; whether I should justly be punished for the words which have been read, or whether, on the contrary, I deserve to have your deepest gratitude for having so glorified Athens and our ancestors and the wars which were

	fought in those days that the orators who had composed discourses on this theme have destroyed them all, being ashamed of their own efforts, while they who to-day are reputed to be clever dare no longer to speak upon this subject, but confess the feebleness of their own powers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But yet, although these things are true, you will find among those who are unable to create or say anything of value, but are past masters in criticizing and prejudicing the works of others, some who will say that all this is spoken “prettily” (for they will be too grudging to say “well”), but that those discourses are better and more profitable which denounce our present mistakes than those which praise our past deeds, and those which counsel us what we ought to do than those which recount ancient history.

	Well, then, in order that I may forestall even this objection, I shall abstain from defending the speech to which you have listened and shall attempt to bring before you a selection of equal length from another oration, in which it will be seen that I have given much attention to all these questions. At the beginning of this oration I speak on the question of making peace with the Chians, the Rhodians, and the Byzantines; and, after I have shown that it is to the advantage of Athens to end the war, I decry our dominion over the Hellenes and our sea-power, showing that it is no whit different, either in its conduct or in its results, from tyranny. I recall also the evils which that power has brought upon Athens, upon the Lacedaemonians, and upon all the others.

	You have heard parts of two discourses; I want now to run through a few topics from a third, in order that it may become even more evident to you that all my writings tend toward virtue and justice. The one which is about to be produced before you is addressed to Nicocles of Cyprus, who at that time was king, and is made up of advice to him as to how to rule over his people. It is not, however, composed in the same style as the extracts which have been read. For in them each part is always in accord and in logical connexion with that which goes before; but in this, on the contrary, I detach one part from another, and breaking up the discourse, as it were, into what we call general heads, I strive to express in a few words each bit of counsel which I have to offer.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But my reason for writing upon this subject was that I thought my advice would be the best means of aiding his understanding and at the same time the readiest means of publishing my own principles. It was with the same motive that I decided to present this discourse to you on the present occasion, not that it is the best written of my works, but that through it you will best see in what spirit I am wont to deal with princes as well as with

	private men; for you will see that I have expressed myself to Nicocles as a free man and an Athenian should, not paying court to his wealth nor to his power, but pleading the cause of his subjects, and striving with all my powers to secure for them the mildest government possible. And since in addressing a king I have spoken for his subjects, surely I would urge upon men who live under a democracy to pay court to the people.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now in the introduction and in the opening words of that discourse I reproach monarchs because they who more than others ought to cultivate their understanding are less educated than men in private station. After discussing this point, I enjoin upon Nicocles not to be easy-going and not to feel that he had taken up the royal office as one takes up the office of a priest, but to put aside his selfish pleasures and give his mind to his affairs. And I try to persuade him also that it ought to be revolting to his mind to see the base ruling over the good and the foolish giving orders to the wise, saying to him that the more vigorously he condemns folly in other men, the more should he cultivate his own understanding.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

For it would be absurd, when I see other men making use of my words, if I alone should refrain from using what I have written in former days, especially now when I have chosen to repeat to you not merely small parts but whole divisions of my speeches.

But I want to say just a word in behalf of each of them and so make it still more manifest that what I then said and what I now say about them is true.

	First of all, tell me what eloquence could be more righteous or more just than one which praises our ancestors in a manner worthy of their excellence and of their achievements? Again, what could be more patriotic or more serviceable to Athens than one which shows that by virtue both of our other benefactions and of our exploits in war we have greater claims to the hegemony than the Lacedaemonians? And, finally, what discourse could have a nobler or a greater theme than one which summons the Hellenes to make an expedition against

	[m1]\ [/m]
	Well, then, in the first speech I have discoursed upon these themes, and in those later quoted upon matters which, though less lofty, are by no means less fruitful or less advantageous to our city. And you will appreciate the power of these discourses if you will read them side by side with others written by orators of recognized ability and service to mankind.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now everyone would admit, I think, that our laws have been the source of very many and very great benefits to the life of humanity.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But our enjoyment of these laws is a boon which, in the very nature of the case, is limited to the affairs of our state and to the engagements which you enter into with each other; whereas, if you would heed my words, you might direct the whole of Hellas with honour and justice and, at the same time, with advantage to Athens. Men of wisdom ought to concern themselves both for the interests of our city and for the interests of Hellas, but should give preference to the broader and worthier cause;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and they ought, furthermore, to appreciate the fact that while any number of men both among the Hellenes and among the barbarians have been able to lay down laws, there are not many who can discourse upon questions of public welfare in a spirit worthy both of Athens and of Hellas.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For these reasons, men who make it their duty to invent discourses of that kind should be held in higher esteem than those who propose and write down laws, inasmuch as they are rarer, have the more difficult task, and must have superior qualities

	of mind. Especially is this true in our day; for, at the time when the human race was beginning to come into existence and to settle together in cities,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] it was natural that their searching should have been for much the same thing; but to-day, on the other hand, when we have advanced to the point where the discourses which have been spoken and the laws which have been laid down are innumerable, and where we single out the oldest among laws and the newest among discourses for our praise, these tasks no longer call for the same understanding; nay, those who have elected to make laws have had at their service a multitude of laws already made (for they have no need to search for new laws, but only to put forth the effort to collect those which are approved in other states, which anyone who so desires can easily do), while those who occupy themselves with oratory, seeing that most subjects have been seized upon and used by others before them, are in the opposite case; for if they repeat the same things which have been said in the past, they will be regarded as shameless babblers, and if they seek for what is new, they will have great difficulty in finding it. That is why I stated that, while both are entitled to your praise, they are the more entitled to it who are able to execute the harder task.

	by all. They, again, are satisfied if through the prestige of their names they can draw a number of pupils into their society; I, you will find, have never invited any person to follow me, but endeavour to persuade the whole state to pursue a policy from which the Athenians will become prosperous themselves, and at the same time deliver the rest of the Hellenes from their present ills.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And yet, when anyone devotes his life to urging all his fellow-countrymen to be nobler and juster leaders of the Hellenes, how is it conceivable that such a man should corrupt his followers? What man possessed of the power to discover discourses of this character would try to search for those that are pernicious and have to do with pernicious things, especially a man who has reaped from his works the rewards which I have had? For the writing and publication of them has won me distinction in many parts of the world and brought me many disciples, no one of whom would have remained with me had they not found in me the very kind of man they expected to find. In fact, although I have had so many pupils, and they have studied with me in some cases three, and in some cases four years, yet not one of them will be found to have uttered a word of complaint about his sojourn with me; on the contrary, when at the last the time would come for them to sail away to their parents or their friends at home, so happy did they feel in their life with me, that they would always take their leave with regret and tears.

Ought you to believe a man who is so unscrupulous and so brazen that, having indicted me for teaching the kind of eloquence which enables people to gain their own advantage contrary to justice, he has not brought before you the slightest evidence of this but has dwelt from the beginning to the end of his speech on the iniquity of corrupting our youth—as if anyone disputed that, or as if it were necessary for him to prove what all men concede, instead of showing simply that I have been guilty of this offence? Why, if anyone were to bring this fellow to trial for kidnapping or stealing or highway robbery, and, instead of proving that he had done any of these things, were to hold forth on the iniquity of each of these crimes, my opponent would reply that his accuser was mad and talked like a fool; yet he has, himself, used just such arguments and thinks that you do not see through him. I, however, believe that even the most simple-minded of people recognize that an accusation, to be convincing and to carry great weight, must not be one which may be employed equally well against the innocent, but one which can be applied only to the guilty. My accuser has made light of this fact, and has made a speech which is in no respect pertinent to the indictment. For he ought both to have produced before you the speeches by which I corrupt my associates and to have named to you the pupils who have been debased by association with me.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] However, he has done neither of these things, but has rejected the most legitimate form of accusation and attempted to lead you astray.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	I had my speeches read to you a moment ago; I shall now bring before you the men who have been associated with me from the time of my youth to the days of my old age, and from your own number I shall present men of my own years to bear witness to the truth of what I say.

	Among the first to begin studying with me were Eunomus, Lysitheides, and Callippus; and following them were Onetor, Anticles, Philonides, Philomelus, and Charmantides.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] All these men were crowned by Athens with chaplets of gold,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] not because they were covetous of other people’s possessions, but because they were honourable men and had spent large sums of their private fortunes upon the city.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Suppose whatever you like as to the nature of my relations with them; for the result, at any rate so far as the present issue is concerned, will be altogether to my advantage. For if you suppose that I was their counsellor and teacher, I should deserve from you greater gratitude than those who are maintained in the Prytaneum in recognition of excellence;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] for each of the latter has furnished to the city his own high qualities alone, whereas I have furnished those of all whom I have just now named to you.

	I am being tried. For if I have had the affection of men who have received rewards in recognition of excellence, but have nothing in common with the sycophant, then how, in all reason, could you judge me to be a corrupter of youth? Verily, I should be the most unfortunate of all men if, when others are esteemed better or worse, as the case may be, from the manner of their lives and from the character of their associates, I alone should be denied this basis of judgement; and if I, who have lived all my life in company with such men, and have kept myself above all criticism up to this point in my career, should be classed with those who from the manner of their lives and the character of their associates have got themselves a bad name. I should like to know what in the world my fate would have been if I had numbered among my associates anyone like my accuser, when, although I hate all his kind and am hated by them, I am yet subjected to this trial.

	Nor, I assure you, can my case be justly injured by the argument which certain of those who are entirely hostile to me may, perhaps, dare to put forth, namely, that I have associated with the men I have mentioned merely to the extent of having been seen conversing with them, whereas I have had as my disciples many of another sort, mischievous characters, whom I am trying to conceal from you. For I have ready at hand a reply which will refute and confound all calumnies of that sort. For I ask this of you: If any of those who have been associated with me have turned out to be good men in their relations to the state, to their friends, and to their own households—I ask you to give them the praise and not to be grateful to me on their account; but

	if, on the other hand, any of them have turned out to be bad—the kind of men who lay information, hale people into court, and covet the property of others—then to let the penalty be visited on me. What proposition could be less invidious or more fair than one which claims no credit for those who are honourable, but offers to submit to punishment for any who have become depraved? And these are no idle words; on the contrary, if anyone can name anyone of that kind to you, I yield the floor[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] for this purpose to my accuser or to anyone else who may desire it—not that there are not persons who would gladly perjure themselves to my harm, but that they would be shown up to you at once, and the injury would fall upon them, not upon me . . .

See § 129 and note. Unable to pay this, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died shortly after. See Grote, [c dimgray]History[/c], vol. xi. pp. 27 ff.

	I must explain that I did not mention Timotheus when I named my other associates because he was in very different case from them. For, in the first place, my accuser has not dared to say anything derogatory of my other friends, while he has laid greater stress upon his arraignment of Timotheus than upon the charges which he has preferred in his indictment. In the next place, my other friends were entrusted with only a few commissions, although in every case they discharged the duties assigned to them in such a manner that they won the honour which I mentioned a moment ago,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] while Timotheus had the responsibility of many affairs of great importance and over a long period of time. It would not, therefore, have been fitting to discuss him and the others in one group, but it was necessary to separate and segregate them as I have done.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You must not think, however, that what I say in behalf of Timotheus is irrelevant to the present case, nor that I am straying beyond the limits of the indictment; for while it is proper for the layman to say what he has to say in defence of his own actions and then take his seat or else to be thought to overdo his case, yet when anyone occupies a position in the eyes of the public as a counsellor and teacher, he must then justify his followers as well as himself, especially if he is being tried on this charge—which is exactly the position in which I have been placed.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now any other man might be satisfied to say that it is not fair that he should share the blame for any mistakes which Timotheus may have made, on the

	ground that he was given no share in the rewards or the honours which were voted to Timotheus, nor was he even thought worthy by any orator of being commended as an adviser of the latter, and that it is only fair that one should either share the good fortunes of another, or have no part in his misfortunes. I, however, should be ashamed to make this plea, and I make you the same proposition regarding Timotheus as I made regarding my other associates. For I ask that if it turns out that Timotheus was a bad man and committed many wrongs against you—I ask to be allowed to share the blame, to pay the penalty, and to suffer whatever is meted out to the guilty; but if, on the other hand, it is shown that he was both a good citizen and a greater general than any other within our knowledge, then I hold that you should praise him and be grateful to him, while as to this indictment against me, you should pass whatever judgement you may deem fair in the light of what I, myself, have done.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The facts, then, about Timotheus I can put most concisely and in the most comprehensive terms by saying that he has taken more cities by storm than any other man has ever done, and I include all generals who have led armies into the field whether from Athens or from the rest of Hellas. And among these cities were some whose capture compelled all the surrounding territory to make terms with Athens; so great was their importance in each case. For who does not know that Corcyra has the best strategic position among the cities in the neighbourhood of the Peloponnese; Samos, among the cities of Ionia; Sestos and Crithôte, among those in the Hellespont;

Indeed, for the voyage of the fleet around the Peloponnese, Athens allowed him only thirteen talents and fifty triremes,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and yet he captured Corcyra, a city with a fleet of eighty triremes, and about the same time he won a naval battle over the Lacedaemonians and forced them to agree to the terms of the present peace—a peace which has so changed the relative positions of Athens and of Lacedaemon that from that day to this we celebrate the peace with sacrifices every year because no other treaty has been so advantageous to our city;[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] while, as for the Lacedaemonians, no man since that time has seen a ship of theirs voyage this side of Malea[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] nor any land force advance beyond the Isthmus, and anyone can see in this fact the cause of their disaster at Leuctra.

	Timotheus, without receiving from you or collecting from your allies any money whatsoever, captured after a siege of ten months with a force of eight thousand light-armed troops and thirty triremes, and he paid all these forces from the spoils of war. And if you can point to any other man who has done a like thing, I stand ready to admit my folly in attempting to praise superlatively one who has done no more than others.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Well, then, from Samos he sailed away and captured Sestos and Crithôte,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] forcing you, who up to that time had been careless of your interests in the Chersonese, to give your attention to that territory. And finally he took Potidaea, upon which Athens had in times past squandered twenty-four hundred talents, and he met the expense from money which he himself provided and from contributions of the Thracians; and, for full measure, he reduced all the Chalcideans to subjection.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	To speak, not in detail, but in summary, he made you masters of twenty-four cities and spent in doing so less than your fathers paid out in the siege of Melos.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I could wish that just as it has been quite easy to recount his exploits, so it were possible to picture briefly the circumstances under which each of them was accomplished—what the situation was in Athens in each case and what the strength of our. foes—, for you would then have been made to appreciate much more highly the worth of his achievements and of the man himself. As it is, the subject is so large that I must leave it untouched.

	But I think you would like to have me explain to you why in the world it is that some of the generals who have a high reputation among you and are thought to be great fighters have not been able to take even a village, while Timotheus, who lacks a robust physique and has not knocked about with itinerant armies but has shared with you the duties of a citizen, has accomplished such great things. What I have to say on this question will no doubt be offensive, but it will not be without profit for you to hear it. Timotheus was superior to all the rest in that he did not hold the same views as you with regard to the affairs of the Hellenes and of your allies and the manner in which they should be directed. For you elect as your generals men who have the most robust bodies[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and who have served in many campaigns with foreign armies, thinking that under their leadership you will have some success. Timotheus, on the other hand, used these men as captains and division-commanders, while he, himself, showed his ability in the very things which it is necessary for a good general to know.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What, then, are the requisites of a good general and what ability do they involve? For they cannot be summed up in a word, but must be explained clearly. First of all is the ability to know against whom and with whose help to make war; for this is the first requisite of good strategy, and if one makes any mistake about this, the result is inevitably a war which is disadvantageous, difficult, and to no purpose. Well, in this kind of sagacity there has never been anyone like him or even comparable with him, as may easily be seen from his deeds themselves. For, although he undertook most of his wars without

	[m1]\ [/m]
	What, then, is the second requisite of a good general? It is the ability to collect an army which is adequate to the war in hand, and to organize and to employ it to good advantage. Now, that Timotheus understood how to employ his forces to good purpose, his achievements themselves have shown; that in the ability to recruit armies which were splendidly equipped and reflected honour upon Athens he excelled all other men, no one even of his enemies would dare to gainsay; and, furthermore, in the power both to bear the privations and hardships of army life, and again to find abundant resources, who of the men who were with him in the field would not pronounce him incomparable? For they know that at the beginning of his campaigns, owing to the fact that he received nothing from Athens, he found himself in great extremities, but that, even with this handicap, he was able to bring his fortunes round to the point where he not only prevailed over our enemies but paid his soldiers in full.

	These are great things and compel our admiration; but the facts which I now give entitle him to even greater praise.

	of Athens; on the contrary, he made it the object of his thought and of his actions to see to it that no one of the cities of Hellas should be afraid of him, but that all should feel secure excepting those which did wrong; for he realized that men who are afraid hate those who inspire this feeling in them, and that it was due to the friendship of the other cities that Athens rose to great power and prosperity, just as it was due to their hatred that she barely escaped the most disastrous fate. Bearing in mind these facts, he used the power of Athens in order to subdue her enemies, and the force of his own character in order to win the good will of the rest of the world, believing that this is a greater and nobler kind of generalship than to conquer many cities many times in battle. So concerned was he that none of the cities should in the slightest degree suspect him of sinister designs that whenever he intended to take his fleet to any of the cities which had been remiss in their contributions,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] he sent word to the authorities and announced his coming beforehand, lest his appearance without warning in front of their ports might plunge them into disquiet and confusion; and if he happened to harbour his fleet in any place, he would never permit his soldiers to plunder and pillage and sack the people’s houses, but took as great precautions to prevent such an occurrence as the owners would take to guard their own possessions; for his mind was not upon winning for himself the good opinion of his soldiers by such licence, but upon winning for Athens the good opinion of the Hellenes. Moreover, when cities had been taken by him in battle, he would treat them with a mildness and a consideration for their rights

	Therefore it was that, because of the reputation which this conduct gave him, many of the cities which had no love for Athens used to welcome him with gates thrown wide; and he, in turn, never set up any disturbance in them, but just as he found them governed when he entered their gates, so he left them when he passed out.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And now to sum up all this: In other times many calamities were wont to be visited upon the Hellenes, but, under his leadership, no one can point to cities devastated, governments overthrown, men murdered or driven into exile, or any other of those ills that are irreparable.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Nay, so complete was the respite from such misfortunes in his day that, so far back as we can remember, he is the only general under whom no complaint was raised against Athens by the other Hellenes. And surely you ought to find your ideal of a good general, not in one who by a single stroke of good fortune has attained, like Lysander,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] a success which it has been the lot of no other man to achieve, but one who, though loaded with many difficult responsibilities of all sorts, has always discharged them with honesty and wisdom. And just this has been the fortune of Timotheus.

	cities and having never lost a single one, was tried for treason, and again when he submitted his reports, and Iphicrates took upon himself the responsibility for the conduct of the campaign and Menestheus accounted for the moneys expended upon it, they, on the one hand, were acquitted, while Timotheus was fined a larger sum than anyone in the past had ever been condemned to pay.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] The fact is, however, that I desire to stand up for Athens also. It is true that if you consider the actions of the city by the standard of pure justice, no one of you can avoid the conclusion that her treatment of Timotheus was cruel and abominable; but if you make allowance for the ignorance which possesses all mankind, for the feelings of envy that are aroused in us, and, furthermore, for the confusion and turmoil in which we live, you will find that nothing of what has been done has come about without a reason nor does the cause lie outside our human weakness, but that Timotheus, also, has been responsible in some degree for the mistaken judgements passed upon these things. For while he was no anti-democrat nor a misanthrope, nor arrogant, nor possessed of any such defect of character, yet because of his proud bearing—an advantage to the office of a general but out of place in dealing with men from day to day—everyone attributed to him the faults which I have named; for he was by nature as inept in courting the favour of men as he was gifted in handling affairs.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]In the campaign against Byzantium, which was aided
	by the Chians and their allies (357 b.c.), a conflict arose
	between Chares and the other commanders of the Athenian
	fleet, Timotheus, Iphicrates, and Menestheus, Iphicrates’
	son. Chares persisted in carrying out a plan of attack which
	had been agreed upon but which the others abandoned on
	account of a storm. Unsupported in this, he was defeated.
	Returning to Athens, he then charged his colleagues with
	treason and corruption. In the trial Iphicrates shouldered the responsibility for the campaign, and Menestheus gave a full accounting for the receipts and expenditures. They were acquitted, while Timotheus, never popular with the demos, was fined 100 talents. See § 101, note. Isocrates’ version of the facts is generally accepted.

	Indeed he has often been advised by me, among others, that while men who are in public life and desire to be in favour must adopt the principle of doing what is most serviceable and noble and of saying what is most true and just, yet they must at the same time not neglect to study and consider well how in everything they say and do they may convince the people of their graciousness and human sympathy; since those who are careless of these matters are thought by their fellow-citizens to be disagreeable and offensive. “You observe,” I would say to him, “the nature of the multitude, how susceptible they are to flattery; that they like those who cultivate their favour better than those who seek their good; and that they prefer those who cheat them with beaming smiles and brotherly love to those who serve them with dignity and reserve. You have paid no attention to these things, but are of the opinion that if you attend honestly to your enterprises abroad, the people at home also will think well of you. But this is not the case, and the very contrary is wont to happen. For if you please the people in Athens, no matter what you do they will not judge your conduct by the facts but will construe it in a light favourable to you; and if you make mistakes, they will overlook them, while if you succeed, they will exalt your success to the high heaven. For good will has this effect upon all men.

	Athens and to Hellas, but he could not lower himself to the level of people who are intolerant of their natural superiors. Sort was that the orators occupied themselves with inventing many false charges against him, and the multitude with drinking them in. I should be glad to refute these slanders, if the occasion permitted me to do so; for I believe that if you could hear me, you would come to loathe the men who have stirred the city to anger against Timotheus and the men who dare to speak evil of him. Now, however, I shall leave this subject and take up again my own defence and the case before us.

	But I am at a loss to know how to proceed with the rest of my speech—what topic to take up first and what next; for the power to speak in any set order has escaped me. Perhaps, therefore, I have no choice but to discuss each point as it happens to occur to me. Accordingly, I am going to lay bare to you the thoughts which have now come into my mind. I have been thinking all along that I ought to put them before you, but I have been advised against doing so. For when I was indicted, I pondered these very matters, as any one of you would have done, and I reviewed my life and my actions, dwelling longest on the things for which I thought I deserved approbation. But one of my associates, hearing me, made bold to urge an objection which was amazing in the extreme; he stated that while my life as I described it was worthy of emulation, yet he himself greatly feared that my story would irritate many of my hearers.

But in you they see a man who has no part in these things,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] who lives in a manner different from the sophists as well as from laymen, and from those who enjoy many possessions as well as from those who live in want.

	It was for these reasons that I chose this manner of life. And if I have refrained from accepting the bounties which are distributed by the city it was because I thought it outrageous if I, who am able to maintain myself from my private resources, should stand in the way of any of those who have been compelled to get their livelihood from the city, and if because of my presence[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] anyone should be deprived of the necessities of existence.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now for this I deserved praise rather than prejudice. But as things are I am utterly at a loss to know what I could do to satisfy men of this stamp. For if I have made it my object all my life not to injure or burden or offend any man, and if by this very course I offend certain people, what could I do to please them? Or what conclusion is left to me other than that I seem to be unfortunate, and that these people appear to be boorish and churlish toward their fellow-citizens?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is, therefore, utter folly to seek to justify myself to those who are not minded like other men but are harder on the innocent than on the guilty; for it is obvious that the more honest a man shows himself to be, the more hopeless will he make his case in their eyes. But to the others[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] I must address myself in reply to the false charge of Lysimachus that I am possessed of enormous wealth, lest this statement, if credited, impose upon me greater public burdens than I could bear.

	Now, generally speaking, you will find that no one of the so-called sophists has accumulated a great amount of money, but that some of them have lived in poor, others in moderate circumstances. The man who in our recollection laid up the most was Gorgias of Leontini.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] He spent his time in Thessaly when the Thessalians were the most prosperous[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] people in Hellas; he lived a long life[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and devoted himself to the making of money; he had no fixed domicile in any city and therefore paid out nothing for public weal nor was he subject to any tax; moreover, he did not marry and beget children, but was free from this, the most unremitting and expensive of burdens; and yet, although he had so great an advantage toward laying up more wealth than any other man, he left at his death only a thousand staters.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] And surely on the subject of each other’s incomes we must not credit people who make charges at haphazard nor think that the earnings of the sophists are equal to those of the actors,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] but should judge men of the same profession in reference to each other and go on the principle that those of the same order of talent in each profession have incomes which are comparable. If, then, you will class me with the sophist who has made more money than any other, and will compare me with him, you will not seem to engage in utterly blind conjectures on such matters, nor shall I be found to have managed badly in providing either for the public welfare or for my own, although, as a matter of fact, I have lived on less than I have expended on my public

	[m1]\ [/m]
	It occurs to me as I am speaking what a change has come over Athens; people nowadays do not look at things in the same way as those who lived in the city in former times. For, when I was a boy, wealth was regarded as a thing so secure as well as admirable that almost every one affected to own more property than he actually possessed, because he wanted to enjoy the standing which it gave.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Now, on the other hand, a man has to be ready to defend himself against being rich as if it were the worst of crimes, and to keep on the alert if he is to avoid disaster; for it has become far more dangerous to be suspected of being well off than to be detected in crime; for criminals are pardoned or let off with slight penalties, while the rich are ruined utterly, and it will be found that the number of men who have been spoiled of their property is greater than those who have been punished for their misdeeds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But why speak of public affairs? For I have myself, in my own affairs, suffered not a little from this change. For when I was beginning to repair my own fortunes after I had lost in the Peloponnesian War the patrimony which remained to me from what my father had spent partly in rendering himself serviceable to the state and partly in educating me with such care that I was more conspicuous then and more distinguished among the youth of my own age and among my fellow-students than I am now among my fellow-citizens[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—when, as I have said, I began

	to attach pupils to myself, I thought that if I could acquire a greater competence and attain a higher position than others who had started in the same profession, I should be acclaimed both for the superiority of my teaching and for the excellence of my conduct. But the result has been the very opposite; for if I had turned out to be worthless and had excelled in nothing, no one would have made trouble for me;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] nay, I might have been a flagrant offender and yet lived secure—from the sycophants, at any rate. But now, instead of the acclaim which I expected, I have been rewarded with trials and perils and envy and calumny. For so much does the Athens of this day rejoice in repressing and humiliating honest men, while giving licence to the depraved to say and do what they please, that Lysimachus, a man who has elected to live by practising intrigue and by preying from day to day on his fellow-citizens, is here in court denouncing me; while I, who have never in my life injured any man, who have kept my hands clean from such spoils, and have provided my advantages from foreigners who feel that I have served them well, am charged with grave offences and placed in very great peril by this trial. And yet all sensible men would do well to pray the gods to endow as many of our people as possible with the power of getting means from abroad in order to make themselves serviceable to the city, even as I have done.

	But, though there are many anomalies in my situation, it would be the crowning absurdity of all if, when the men who have paid me money are so grateful to me that they are still even now devoted to me, you on whom I have spent my means

It would be even more absurd if, whereas Pindar, the poet, was so highly-honoured by our forefathers because of a single line of his in which he praises Athens as “the bulwark of Hellas”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] that he was made “proxenos”[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and given a present of ten thousand drachmas, I, on the other hand, who have glorified Athens and our ancestors with much ampler and nobler encomiums, should not even be privileged to end my days in peace.

	With regard, then, to this as well as to the other charges of my accuser, I consider that the defence which I have made is a sufficient answer. Nevertheless, I am not going to hesitate to confide in you the truth as to how I now feel about the pending trial and how I felt about it at the first. I was very confident that for myself personally I could make out a good case; for I relied upon the character of my life and conduct, and believed that I had no lack of arguments to justify them. But as I observed not only the intolerant feeling toward the teaching of eloquence on the part of those who are churlish toward everyone, but the truculent attitude towards it on the part of my fellow-citizens in general, I began to be afraid that the truth regarding me personally might be overlooked and that I might suffer some harm from the common prejudice against the sophists.

For I knew that the honest men among you—and it is to those that I shall address myself—do not remain fixed in opinions which they have formed unjustly, but are in quest of the truth and are ready to be convinced by those who plead a just cause; and I believed that I should have abundant grounds to show that philosophy has been unjustly slandered, and that it deserves much more to be held in favour than in contempt; and I am still of the same opinion.

	However, it is not surprising that liberal pursuits have sometimes failed of recognition and regard, nor that some people have been utterly misled about them. In fact we find that this happens in regard to ourselves as well as to other things without number. For our city, which is now and has been in the past the author of so many blessings both to our own people and to the other Hellenes, and which abounds in so many charms, has, nevertheless, a most serious drawback. For Athens is so large and the multitude of people living here is so great, that the city does not present to the mind an image easily grasped or sharply defined, but, like a turbid flood, whatever it catches up in its course, whether men or things, in each case it sweeps them along pell-mell, and in some cases it imbues them with a reputation which is the opposite of the true; and exactly that has been the fortune of this system of education.

	reason, nor be as careless when you sit in judgement as you are in your private occupations, but must examine thoroughly each point and search for the truth, mindful of your oaths and of the laws under which you have come together to dispense justice. It is no minor question which is under discussion and on trial here, but the most important in the world. For you are to determine by your votes, not my fate only, but that of a way of life to which many of our youths are devoting their minds.

	I suppose that you are not unaware of the fact that the government of the state is handed on by the older men to the youth of the coming generation; and that since the succession goes on without end, it follows of necessity that as is the education of our youth so from generation to generation will be the fortune of the state. Therefore, you must not let the sycophants have control of a thing so momentous, nor punish those who refuse to pay them money, while permitting those from whom they have received it to do whatever they please. But if philosophy has an influence which tends to corrupt our youth, you ought not merely to punish the occasional offender whom some sycophant hales into court but to banish all who are engaged in teaching it. If, however, it has the opposite effect and helps and improves and makes better men of its devotees, then you should call a halt on those who load this study with abuse; you should strip the sycophants of their rewards, and counsel our young men to occupy themselves with this pursuit above all others.

	charge, if I could have faced this trial in the fullness of my vigour; for in that case I should have felt no misgiving but should have been better able both to protect myself from my accuser and to champion the cause of liberal education. Now, however, I am afraid that, although I have been enabled by this education to speak well enough on other themes, I may find that I have discoursed less ably upon this subject than upon matters which should have concerned me less. And yet I would rather lay down my life this day—for you shall have the truth even though the words be inept[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—after having spoken adequately upon this theme and persuaded you to look upon the study of eloquence in its true light, than live many times my allotted span and see it continue to fare among you as it now does.

	My aspiration, then, is much greater than my power to do the subject justice; but yet I shall try as best I can to explain what is the nature of this education, what is its power, what of the other arts it is akin to, what benefit it is to its devotees, and what claims I make for it. For I think that when you know the truth about this you will be in a better position to deliberate and pronounce judgement upon it. But I beg of you, if I appear to carry on the discussion in a manner far removed from that which is customary here, not to be impatient but to bear with me,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] remembering that when a man is defending himself on a charge unlike any other, he must resort to a kind of pleading which is out of the ordinary.

	In my treatment of the art of discourse, I desire, like the genealogists, to start at the beginning.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] It is acknowledged that the nature of man is compounded of two parts, the physical and the mental, and no one would deny that of these two the mind comes first and is of greater worth; for it is the function of the mind to decide both on personal and on public questions, and of the body to be servant to the judgements of the mind. Since this is so, certain of our ancestors, long before our time, seeing that many arts had been devised for other things, while none had been prescribed for the body and for the mind, invented and bequeathed to us two disciplines, physical training for the body, of which gymnastics is a part, and, for the mind, philosophy, which I am going to explain. These are twin arts—parallel and complementary—by which their masters prepare the mind to become more intelligent and the body to become more serviceable, not separating sharply the two kinds of education, but using similar methods of instruction, exercise, and other forms of discipline.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For when they take their pupils in hand, the physical trainers instruct their followers in the postures which have been devised for bodily contests, while the teachers of philosophy impart all the forms of discourse in which the mind expresses itself. Then, when they have made them familiar and thoroughly

	conversant with these lessons, they set them at exercises, habituate them to work, and require them to combine in practice the particular things which they have learned, in order that they may grasp them more firmly and bring their theories into closer touch with the occasions for applying them—I say “theories,” for no system of knowledge can possibly cover these occasions, since in all cases they elude our science.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Yet those who most apply their minds to them and are able to discern the consequences which for the most part grow out of them, will most often meet these occasions in the right way.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Watching over them and training them in this manner, both the teachers of gymnastic and the teachers of discourse are able to advance their pupils to a point where they are better men and where they are stronger in their thinking or in the use of their bodies. However, neither class of teachers is in possession of a science by which they can make capable athletes or capable orators out of whomsoever they please. They can contribute in some degree to these results, but these powers are never found in their perfection save in those who excel by virtue both of talent and of training.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	I have given you now some impression of what philosophy is.

	they must, first of all, have a natural aptitude for that which they have elected to do; secondly, they must submit to training and master the knowledge of their particular subject, whatever it may be in each case; and, finally, they must become versed and practised in the use and application of their art; for only on these conditions can they become fully competent and pre-eminent in any line of endeavour. In this process, master and pupil each has his place; no one but the pupil can furnish the necessary capacity; no one but the master, the ability to impart knowledge; while both have a part in the exercises of practical application: for the master must painstakingly direct his pupil, and the latter must rigidly follow the master’s instructions.

	Now these observations apply to any and all the arts. If anyone, ignoring the other arts, were to ask me which of these factors has the greatest power in the education of an orator I should answer that natural ability is paramount and comes before all else.

	a superficial and common training, be an orator such as has never, perhaps, been seen among the Hellenes? Again, we know that men who are less generously endowed by nature but excel in experience and practice, not only improve upon themselves, but surpass others who, though highly gifted, have been too negligent of their talents. It follows, therefore, that either one of these factors may produce an able speaker or an able man of affairs, but both of them combined in the same person might produce a man incomparable among his fellows.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	These, then, are my views as to the relative importance of native ability and practice. I cannot, however, make a like claim for education; its powers are not equal nor comparable to theirs. For if one should take lessons in all the principles of oratory and master them with the greatest thoroughness, he might, perhaps, become a more pleasing speaker than most, but let him stand up before the crowd and lack one thing only, namely, assurance, and he would not be able to utter a word.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But let no one of you think that before you I belittle my pretensions, while when I address those who desire to become my pupils I claim every power for my teaching; for it was to avoid just such a charge as this that, when I entered upon my profession, I wrote and published a discourse in which you will find that I attack those who make pretensions which are unwarranted, and set forth my own ideas. Now I am not going to quote from it my criticisms of others; for they are too long for the present occasion; but I shall attempt to repeat to you that part in which I express my own views.

	\[Extract from [c dimgray]Against the Sophists[/c] 14–18. See this Vol. pp. 170–175.\]
	Now this quotation is of a more finished style[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] than what has been said before, but its meaning is the same, and this ought to be taken by you as a convincing proof of my honesty; for you see that I did not brag and make big promises when I was young only to speak modestly for my philosophy now that I have reaped the harvest of my labours and am an old man, but that, on the contrary, I speak in the same terms both when I was at the height of my career and now when I am ready to retire from it, both when I had no thought of danger and now when I stand in jeopardy, and both in addressing those who wanted to become my pupils and now in addressing those who are to vote upon my fate. I do not see, therefore, how the sincerity and honesty of my professions could be more clearly shown.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Let this quotation, then, add its weight to what I have said before. I do not, however, delude myself as to the people who are ill disposed towards my teaching: nothing of what I have said so far is enough to disabuse them of this feeling; and it will take many arguments of all sorts to convert them to a different opinion from that which they now hold. Accordingly I must not leave off expounding and speaking until I shall accomplish one of two things—until I have persuaded them to change their views or have proved that the slanders and charges which they repeat against me are false.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	These charges are of two kinds. Some of them say that the profession of the sophist is nothing but sham and chicane, maintaining that no kind of

	education has ever been discovered which can improve a man’s ability to speak or his capacity for handling affairs, and that those who excel in these respects owe their superiority to natural gifts; while others acknowledge that men who take this training are more able, but complain that they are corrupted and demoralized by it, alleging that when they gain the power to do so, they scheme to get other people’s property.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now there is not a sound or true word in either complaint, as I am very confident that I can prove to everyone. First of all I would have you note, in the case of those who assert that education is a sham, that they quite obviously talk rubbish themselves; for while they ridicule it as powerless to help us—nothing but humbug and chicane—at the same time they demand that my pupils show improvement from the moment they come to me; that when they have been with me a few days, they must be abler and wiser in speech than those who have the advantage over them both in years and in experience; and that when they have been with me no more than a year, they must all be good and finished orators; nor must the indolent be a whit less accomplished than the industrious, nor they who are lacking in ability than those who are blessed with vigorous minds. These are the requirements they set up, and yet they have never heard me make such promises, nor have they ever seen like results in the other arts and disciplines. On the contrary, all knowledge yields itself up to us only after great effort on our part, and we are by no means all equally capable of working out in practice what we learn. Nay, from all our schools only two or three students

	And yet how can we fail to deny intelligence to those who have the effrontery to demand powers which are not found in the recognized arts of this which they declare is not an art and who expect greater advantages to come from an art in which they do not believe than from arts which they regard as thoroughly perfected? Men of intelligence ought not to form contrary judgements about similar things[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] nor refuse to recognize a discipline which accomplishes the same results as most of the arts. For who among you does not know that most of those who have sat under the sophists have not been duped nor affected as these men claim, but that some of them have been turned out competent champions and others able teachers; while those who have preferred to live in private have become more gracious in their social intercourse[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] than before, and keener judges and more prudent counsellors than the great majority? How then is it possible to scorn a discipline which is able to make of those who have taken advantage of it men of that kind?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Furthermore, this also will be agreed to by all men, namely, that in all the arts and crafts we regard those as the most skilled who turn out pupils who all work as far as possible in the same manner. Now it will be seen that this is the case with philosophy. For all who have been under a true and intelligent guide will be found to have a power of speech so similar that it is evident to everyone that

	they have shared the same training. And yet, had not a common habit and a common technique of training been instilled into them, it is inconceivable that they should have taken on this likeness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Again, every one of you could name many of your schoolfellows who when they were boys seemed to be the dullest among their companions, but who, growing older, outstripped them farther in intelligence and in speech than they had lagged behind them when they were boys. From this fact you can best judge what training can do; for it is evident that when they were young they all possessed such mental powers as they were born with, but as they grew to be men, these outstripped the others and changed places with them in intelligence, because their companions lived dissolutely and softly, while they gave heed to their own opportunities and to their own welfare. But when people succeed in making progress through their own diligence alone, how can they fail to improve in a much greater degree both over themselves and over others if they put themselves under a master who is mature, of great experience, and learned not only in what has been handed down to him but in what he has discovered for himself?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But there remain still other reasons why everyone may well be astonished at the ignorance in men who venture so blindly to condemn philosophy. For, in the first place, they know that pains and industry give proficiency in all other activities and arts, yet deny that they have any such power in the training of the intellect; secondly, they admit that no physical weakness is so hopeless that it cannot be improved

	by exercise and effort, but they do not believe that our minds, which are naturally superior to our bodies, can be made more serviceable through education and suitable training; again, they observe that some people possess the art of training horses and dogs and most other animals by which they make them more spirited, gentle or intelligent, as the case may be, yet they do not think that any education has been discovered for training human nature, such as can improve men in any of those respects in which we improve the beasts. Nay, so great is the misfortune which they impute to us all, that while they would acknowledge that it is by our mental powers that every creature is improved and made more useful, yet they have the hardihood to claim that we ourselves, who are endowed with an intelligence through which we render all creatures of greater worth, cannot help each other to advance in excellence.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But most absurd of all, they behold in the shows which are held year after year lions which are more gentle toward their trainers than some people are toward their benefactors, and bears which dance about and wrestle and imitate our skill, and yet they are not able to judge even from these instances the power which education and training have, nor can they see that human nature will respond more promptly than the animals to the benefits of education. In truth, I cannot make up my mind which should astonish us the more—the gentleness which is implanted in the fiercest of wild beasts or the brutishness which resides in the souls of such men.

	too much on questions about which most men are agreed, I fear you may suspect that I have little to say on questions which are in dispute. Therefore I shall leave this subject and turn my attention to a class of people who do not, to be sure, contemn philosophy but condemn it much more bitterly since they attribute the iniquities of those who profess to be sophists,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but in practice are far different, to those whose ways have nothing in common with them. But I am speaking, not in behalf of all those who pretend to be able to educate the young, but in behalf of those only who have justly earned this reputation, and I think that I shall convince you that my accusers have shot very wide of the truth if only you are willing to hear me to the end.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In the first place, then, we must determine what are the objects which make people venture to do evil; for if we define these correctly, you will be better able to make up your minds whether the charges which have been made against us are true or false. Well then, I maintain that everyone does everything which he does for the sake of pleasure or gain or honour; for I observe that no desire springs up in men save for these objects. If this be so, it only remains to consider which of these objects we should attain by corrupting the young.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Do you suppose it would give us pleasure to see or hear that our pupils were bad and in evil repute with their fellow-citizens? And who is so insensate that he would not be distressed to have such things reported about himself? But surely we could not expect to be admired nor to enjoy great honour for

	sending out disciples of that sort; on the contrary, we should be much more despised and hated than those who are charged with other forms of villainy. And, mark you, even if we could shut our eyes to these consequences, we could not gain the most money by directing a training of that character; for, I suppose, all men are aware that a sophist reaps his finest and his largest reward when his pupils prove to be honourable and intelligent and highly esteemed by their fellow-citizens, since pupils of that sort inspire many with the desire to enjoy his teaching, while those who are depraved repel even those who were formerly minded to join his classes. Who, then, could be blind to the more profitable course, when there is so vast a difference between the two?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Perhaps, however, some might venture to reply that many men, because of their incontinence, are not amenable to reason, but neglect their true interests and rush on in the pursuit of pleasure. I grant you that many men in general and some who pretend to be sophists are of this nature. Nevertheless, no one even of their number is so incontinent as to desire his pupils also to show the same lack of control; for he would not be able to share in the pleasures which they might enjoy as the result of their incontinence, while he would bring down upon his own head most of the evil repute which would result from their depravity.

	Again, whom would they corrupt and what manner of people would they get as pupils? For this is worth inquiring into. Would they get those who are already perverse and vicious? And who, pray, would make

	an effort to learn from another what his own nature teaches him? Would they, then, get those who are honest and ambitious to lead a useful life? But no such person would deign to speak with men who are evil in their words and in their deeds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I should like to ask those who disapprove of me what they think about the students who cross the sea from Sicily, from the Pontus, and from other parts of the world in order to enjoy my instruction. Do they think that they voyage to Athens because of the dearth of evil-minded men at home? But anywhere on earth anyone can find no lack of men willing to aid him in depravity and crime. Do they think, then, that they come here in order to become intriguers and sycophants, at great expense to themselves? But, in the first place, people of this mind are much more inclined to lay hold of other people’s property than to part with anything of their own; and, in the next place, who would pay out money to learn depravity, since it is easy to be depraved at no expense whatever, whenever one is so inclined? For there is no need of taking lessons in evil-doing; all that a man has to do is to set his hands to it.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	No, it is evident that these students cross the sea and pay out money and go to all manner of trouble because they think that they themselves will be the better for it and that the teachers here are much more intelligent than those in their own countries. This ought to fill all Athenians with pride and make them appreciate at their worth those who have given to the city this reputation.

Nevertheless, although they know all this about them, they do not refrain from traducing them and saying that they engage in this training in order that they may defeat the ends of justice in the courts and win their own advantage. And yet who that engages in the practice of injustice and of evil-doing would be willing to live more continently than the rest? Whom have these traducers ever seen reserving and treasuring up their depravities for future use instead of indulging from the first the evil instincts present in their nature?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But, apart from these considerations, if it be true that cleverness in speech results in plotting against other people’s property, we should expect all able speakers to be intriguers and sycophants; for the same cause produces in every instance the same effect. In fact, however, you will find that among our public men who are living to-day or who have but lately passed away those who give most study to the art of words are the best of the statesmen who come before you on the rostrum, and, furthermore, that among the ancients it was the greatest and the most illustrious orators who brought to the city most of her blessings.

	First of all was Solon.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For when he was placed at the head of the people, he gave them laws, set their affairs in order, and constituted the government of the city so wisely that even now Athens is well satisfied with the polity which was organized by him. Next, Cleisthenes, after he had been driven from Athens by the tyrants, succeeded by his eloquence in persuading the Amphictyons to lend him money from the treasury of Apollo,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and thus restored the people to power, expelled the tyrants, and established that democracy to which the world of Hellas owes its greatest blessings. After him, Themistocles,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] placed at the head of our forces in the Persian War, counselled our ancestors to abandon the city[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] (and who could have persuaded them to do this but a man of surpassing eloquence?), and so advanced their circumstances that at the price of being homeless for a few days they became for a long period of time the masters of the Hellenes. Finally, Pericles,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] because he was both a good leader of the people and an excellent orator, so adorned the city with temples, monuments, and other objects of beauty, that even to-day visitors who come to Athens think her worthy of ruling not only the Hellenes, but all the world; and, more than this, he stored away in the Acropolis a sum of not less than ten thousand talents.

	art of discourse; nay, so much more did they apply their minds to eloquence than to other things, that Solon was named one of the seven sophists[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and was given the title which is now dishonoured and on trial here; and Pericles studied under two of the sophists, Anaxagoras of Clazomenae[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and Damon,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] the latter in his day reputed to be the wisest among the Athenians. Could one, then, show more clearly than by these examples that the powers of eloquence do not turn men into evil-doers? No, but, on the other hand, those who are evil from their birth, like my accuser, will, I doubt not, continue to the end indulging their depravity both in words and in deeds.

	But I can show you also where you may see, if you desire, the names of our trouble-makers and of the men who are really liable to the charges which these people apply to the sophists. They are published by law on the tablets which the magistrates set up: public offenders and sycophants have their names published by the Thesmothetae; malefactors and their instigators, by the Eleven; and private offenders and authors of unjust complaints, by the Forty.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] In these lists you will find the names of

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The term “sophists” here is equivalent to “wise men”
	(σοφοί). The list of the “Seven Sages” varied, but Solon
	was always included.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]For the relation of Pericles to Anaxagoras see Plutarch,
	[c dimgray]Pericles.[/c]
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]See Plato, [c dimgray]Laches[/c] 180 d.
	[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]When a case was accepted for trial, the appropriate
	court fixed a day for the preliminary hearing, and published
	the charge on white tablets set up in the market place. See Lipsius, [c dimgray]Das attische Recht[/c] p. 820. The “Thesmothetae” (see 38, note) were responsible for bringing to trial mainly offenders against the state, including sycophants. See Lipsius, [c dimgray]Das attische Recht[/c] pp. 374 ff. The “Eleven,” besides being a board for the care of prisons and for the execution of condemned criminals, dealt with malefactors such as robbers, burglars, pickpockets, kidnappers, etc. See Lipsius, [c dimgray]Das attische Recht[/c] p. 78. “The Forty,” four selected by lot from each of the ten tribes, had jurisdiction over the great mass of private litigation, involving mainly property rights (torts), themselves settling without more ado all petty cases involving sums not exceeding ten drachmas. See Lipsius, [c dimgray]Das attische Recht[/c] pp. 81 ff.

	this fellow and his friends recorded many times, but you will not find my name nor that of anyone of my profession published in a single one of them. On the contrary, you will find that we so order our own affairs as to stand in no need of your lawsuits. And yet, when men keep clear of these troubles, when they live decently and have had no part in any disgraceful act, why do you not give them their due of praise instead of subjecting them to trial? For it is evident that the principles which we instil into our students are such as we practise in our own lives.

	Now you will appreciate even more clearly from the things which I am going to say that I am far from being a corrupter of our youth. For if I were guilty of this, Lysimachus would not be the one to be incensed in their behalf, nor anyone of his kind, but you would see the fathers and relatives of my pupils up in arms, framing writs and seeking to bring me to justice.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But instead of that they bring their sons to me and are ready to pay me money, and are rejoiced when they see them spending their days in my society,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] while the sycophants are the men who speak evil of me and hale me into court. And who more than these sycophants would like to see many of our citizens corrupted and depraved, since they know that when they live among such characters they wield great power,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] whereas when they fall into the hands of honourable and intelligent men, they are doomed to destruction? Therefore these men are wise in seeking to do away with all studies which they consider will make men better, and so render them more intolerant of the depravities

	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I now find myself in a curious position; for I am going to be frank even if some will say that I shift my ground too easily. A little while ago I said that many good men had been misled about philosophy, and are consequently harshly disposed toward it. Now, however, I have assumed that the arguments which I have presented are so plain and evident to all that no one, it seems to me, can misapprehend its power or accuse me of corrupting my disciples or have any such feeling as I imputed to them a little while ago. Nevertheless, if I am to speak the truth and say what has now come into my mind, I am of the opinion that while all those who are envious of my success covet the ability to think and speak well, yet they themselves neglect to cultivate it, some because they are indolent, some because they discredit their own powers, and some on other pretexts (and these are legion); but when other men take great pains and show a desire to attain what they themselves covet, then they grow irritated, jealous, perturbed in spirit, and are much in the same state of mind as lovers are. Indeed, how could one more aptly explain their condition? They envy the good fortune of those who are able to use words eloquently; yet they reproach the youth who aspire to win this distinction. There is no one of them who would not pray the gods to bestow the power of eloquence upon himself, first

	of all, and failing that, upon his sons and his own kin; yet when men strive through work and study to accomplish for themselves what these people would like to have as a gift from the gods, they accuse them of going utterly astray. At one moment they make believe to mock at them as dupes and victims; and then again, for no reason at all, they change about and denounce them as adepts in grasping their own advantage. When any danger threatens the city, they seek counsel from those who can speak best upon the question at issue and act upon their advice; but when men devote their efforts to preparing themselves to serve the state in just such crises, they think it proper to traduce them. And they reproach the Thebans and our other enemies for their ignorance;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] yet when men seek by every means to escape from that malady, they never cease maligning them.

	It would be possible to bring together many more contradictions than the above in the views of these people, but that is a task for those who are younger than I and who are free from anxiety about the present occasion. For example, one might put the following questions on this very subject: Suppose the case of men who, having inherited large fortunes from their ancestors, used their wealth, not to render themselves serviceable to the state, but to outrage their fellow-citizens and to dishonour their sons and their wives; would anyone venture to put the blame upon the authors of their wealth instead of demanding that the offenders themselves be punished? Again, suppose the case of men who, having mastered the art of war, did not use their skill against the enemy, but rose up and slew many of their fellow-citizens; or suppose the case of men who, having been trained to perfection in the art of boxing or of the pancration, kept away from the games and fell foul of the passers-by; would anyone withhold praise from their instructors instead of putting to death those who turned their lessons to an evil use?[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	We ought, therefore, to think of the art of discourse just as we think of the other arts, and not to form opposite judgements about similar things, nor show ourselves intolerant toward that power which, of all the faculties which belong to the nature of man, is the source of most of our blessings. For in the other powers which we possess, as I have already said on a former occasion,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] we are in no respect superior to other living creatures; nay, we are inferior to many in swiftness and in strength and in other resources; but, because there has been implanted in us the power to persuade each other and to make clear to each other whatever we desire, not only have we escaped the life of wild beasts, but we have come together and founded cities and made laws and invented arts; and, generally speaking, there is no institution devised by man which the power of speech has not helped us to establish. For this it is which has laid down laws concerning things just and unjust, and things honourable and base; and if it were not for these ordinances we should not be able to live with one another. It is by this also that we confute the bad and extol the good. Through this we educate the ignorant and appraise the wise; for the power to speak well is taken as the surest index of a sound understanding, and discourse which is true and lawful and just is the outward image of a good and faithful soul. With this faculty we both contend against others on matters which are open to dispute and seek light for ourselves on things which are unknown; for the same arguments which we use in persuading others when we speak in public, we employ also when we deliberate in our own thoughts; and, while we call eloquent

	those who are able to speak before a crowd, we regard as sage those who most skilfully debate their problems in their own minds. And, if there is need to speak in brief summary of this power, we shall find that none of the things which are done with intelligence take place without the help of speech, but that in all our actions as well as in all our thoughts speech is our guide, and is most employed by those who have the most wisdom.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	But without reflecting at all on these truths, Lysimachus has dared to attack those who aspire to an accomplishment which is the source of blessings so many and so great. But why should we be surprised at him when even among the professors of disputation[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] there are some who talk no less abusively of the art of speaking on general and useful themes than do the most benighted of men, not that they are ignorant of its power or of the advantage which it quickly gives to those who avail themselves of it, but because they think that by decrying this art they will enhance the standing of their own.

	to each other; and, furthermore, that I may show you clearly that we who are occupied with political discourse and whom they call contentious are more considerate than they; for although they are always saying disparaging things of me, I shall not answer them in kind but shall confine myself to the simple truth.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For I believe that the teachers who are skilled in disputation and those who are occupied with astronomy and geometry and studies of that sort[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] do not injure but, on the contrary, benefit their pupils, not so much as they profess, but more than others give them credit for. Most men see in such studies nothing but empty talk and hair-splitting; for none of these disciplines has any useful application either to private or to public affairs; nay, they are not even remembered for any length of time after they are learned because they do not attend us through life nor do they lend aid in what we do, but are wholly divorced from our necessities. But I am neither of this opinion nor am I far removed from it; rather it seems to me both that those who hold that this training is of no use in practical life are right and that those who speak in praise of it have truth on their side. If there is a contradiction in this statement, it is because these disciplines are different in their nature from the other studies which make up our education; for the other branches avail us only after we have gained a knowledge of them, whereas these studies can be of no benefit to us after we have mastered them unless we have elected to make our living from this source, and only help us while

	we are in the process of learning. For while we are occupied with the subtlety and exactness of astronomy and geometry and are forced to apply our minds to difficult problems, and are, in addition, being habituated to speak and apply ourselves to what is said and shown to us, and not to let our wits go wool-gathering, we gain the power, after being exercised and sharpened on these disciplines, of grasping and learning more easily and more quickly those subjects which are of more importance and of greater value.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] I do not, however, think it proper to apply the term “philosophy” to a training which is no help to us in the present either in our speech or in our actions, but rather I would call it a gymnastic of the mind and a preparation for philosophy. It is, to be sure, a study more advanced than that which boys in school pursue, but it is for the most part the same sort of thing; for they also when they have laboured through their lessons in grammar, music,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and the other branches, are not a whit advanced in their ability to speak and deliberate on affairs, but they have increased their aptitude for mastering greater and more serious studies. I would, therefore, advise young men to spend some time on these disciplines,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] but not to allow their minds to be dried up by these barren subtleties, nor to be stranded on the speculations of the ancient sophists, who maintain, some of them, that the sum of things is made up of infinite elements; Empedocles that it is made up of four, with strife and love operating among them; Ion, of not more than three; Alcmaeon, of only two; Parmenides

	Now I have spoken and advised you enough on these studies for the present. It remains to tell you about “wisdom” and “philosophy.”[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] It is true that if one were pleading a case on any other issue it would be out of place to discuss these words (for they are foreign to all litigation), but it is appropriate for me, since I am being tried on such an issue, and since I hold that what some people call philosophy is not entitled to that name, to define and explain to you what philosophy, properly conceived, really is. My view of this question is, as it happens, very simple. For since it is not in the nature of man to attain a science by the possession of which we can know positively what we should do or what we should say, in the next resort I hold that man to be wise who is able by his powers of conjecture to arrive generally at the best course, and I hold that man to be a philosopher who occupies himself with the studies from which he will most quickly gain that kind of insight.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	or write discourses which are worthy of praise and honour, it is not conceivable that he will support causes which are unjust or petty or devoted to private quarrels, and not rather those which are great and honourable, devoted to the welfare of man and our common good; for if he fails to find causes of this character, he will accomplish nothing to the purpose. In the second place, he will select from all the actions of men which bear upon his subject those examples which are the most illustrious and the most edifying; and, habituating himself to contemplate and appraise such examples, he will feel their influence not only in the preparation of a given discourse but in all the actions of his life.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] It follows, then, that the power to speak well and think right will reward the man who approaches the art of discourse with love of wisdom and love of honour.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Furthermore, mark you, the man who wishes to persuade people will not be negligent as to the matter of character; no, on the contrary, he will apply himself above all to establish a most honourable name among his fellow-citizens; for who does not know that words carry greater conviction when spoken by men of good repute than when spoken by men who live under a cloud, and that the argument which is made by a man’s life is of more weight than that which is furnished by words?[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Therefore, the stronger a man’s desire to persuade his hearers, the more zealously will he strive to be honourable and to have the esteem of his fellow-citizens.

	to the power of good will. In fact, they appreciate this even more thoroughly than others, and they know, furthermore, that probabilities and proofs and all forms of persuasion support only the points in a case to which they are severally applied, whereas an honourable reputation not only lends greater persuasiveness to the words of the man who possesses it, but adds greater lustre to his deeds, and is, therefore, more zealously to be sought after by men of intelligence than anything else in the world.

	I come now to the question of “advantage”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—the most difficult of the points I have raised. If any one is under the impression that people who rob others or falsify accounts or do any evil thing get the advantage, he is wrong in his thinking; for none are at a greater disadvantage throughout their lives than such men; none are found in more difficult straits, none live in greater ignominy; and, in a word, none are more miserable than they. No, you, ought to believe rather that those are better off now and will receive the advantage in the future at the hands of the gods[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] who are the most righteous and the most faithful in their devotions, and that those receive the better portion at the hands of men who are the most conscientious in their dealings with their associates, whether in their homes or in public life, and are themselves esteemed as the noblest among their fellows.

	This is verily the truth, and it is well for us to adopt this way of speaking on the subject, since, as things now are, Athens has in many respects been plunged into such a state of topsy-turvy and confusion that some of our people no longer use words in their proper meaning but wrest them from the

They characterize men who ignore our practical needs and delight in the mental juggling of the ancient sophists as “students of philosophy,” but refuse this name to whose who pursue and practise those studies which will enable us to govern wisely both our own households and the commonwealth—which should be the objects of our toil, of our study, and of our every act.

Could any charge be more unjust than this against our students? For, while in the prime of vigour, when most men of their age are most inclined to indulge their passions, they have disdained a life of pleasure; when they might have saved expense and lived softly, they have elected to pay out money and submit to toil; and, though hardly emerged from boyhood, they have come to appreciate what most of their elders do not know, namely, that if one is to govern his youth rightly and worthily and make the proper start in life, he must give more heed to himself than to his possessions, he must not hasten and seek to rule over others[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] before he has found a master to direct his own thoughts, and he must not take as great pleasure or pride in other advantages

	I marvel at men who felicitate those who are eloquent by nature on being blessed with a noble gift, and yet rail at those who wish to become eloquent, on the ground that they desire an immoral and debasing education. Pray, what that is noble by nature becomes shameful and base when one attains it by effort? We shall find that there is no such thing, but that, on the contrary, we praise, at least in other fields, those who by their own devoted toil are able to acquire some good thing more than we praise those who inherit it from their ancestors. And rightly so; for it is well that in all activities, and most of all in the art of speaking, credit is won, not by gifts of fortune, but by efforts of study. For men who have been gifted with eloquence by nature and by fortune, are governed in what they say by chance, and not by any standard of what is best, whereas those who have gained this power by the study of philosophy and by the exercise of reason never speak without weighing their words, and so are less often in error as to a course of action.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Therefore, it behoves all men to want to have many of their youth engaged in training to become speakers, and you Athenians most of all. For you, yourselves, are pre-eminent and superior to the rest of the world, not in your application to the business of war, nor because you govern yourselves more excellently or preserve the laws handed down to you

	by your ancestors more faithfully than others, but in those qualities by which the nature of man rises above the other animals,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and the race of the Hellenes above the barbarians, namely, in the fact that you have been educated as have been no other people in wisdom and in speech.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] So, then, nothing more absurd could happen than for you to declare by your votes that students who desire to excel their companions in those very qualities in which you excel mankind, are being corrupted, and to visit any misfortune upon them for availing themselves of an education in which you have become the leaders of the world.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For you must not lose sight of the fact that Athens is looked upon as having become a school[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] for the education of all able orators and teachers of oratory. And naturally so; for people observe that she holds forth the greatest prizes for those who have this ability, that she offers the greatest number and variety of fields of exercise to those who have chosen to enter contests of this character and want to train for them, and that, furthermore, everyone obtains here that practical experience which more than any other thing imparts ability to speak; and, in addition to these advantages, they consider that the catholicity and moderation of our speech,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] as well as our flexibility of mind and love of letters, contribute in no small degree to the education of the orator. Therefore they suppose, and not without just reason, that all clever speakers are the disciples of Athens.

	to pronounce a disparaging judgement upon the reputation which you have among the Hellenes even more than I have among you. Manifestly, by such an unjust verdict, you would be passing sentence upon yourselves. It would be as if the Lacedaemonians were to attempt to penalize men for training themselves in preparation for war, or as if the Thessalians[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] saw fit to punish men for practising the art of horsemanship. Take care, therefore, not to do yourselves this wrong and not to lend support to the slanders of the enemies of Athens rather than to the eulogies of her friends.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I think that you are not unaware that while some of the Hellenes are hostile to you, some are extremely friendly, and rest their hopes of security upon you. These say that Athens is the only city, the others being mere villages, and that she deserves to be termed the capital of Hellas both because of her size and because of the resources which she furnishes to the rest of the world, and most of all because of the character of her inhabitants; for no people, they insist, are more kindly or more sociable,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] nor could anyone find any people with whom he could spend all his days in friendlier intercourse. Indeed, so extravagant are they in their praise that they do not even hesitate to say that they would rather suffer injury at the hands of an Athenian gentleman than benefit through the rudeness of people from another city.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There are, on the other hand, those who scoff at this praise, and, dwelling upon the cruel and iniquitous practices of the sycophants, denounce the whole city as savage and insupportable.

	It is, therefore, the duty of intelligent judges to destroy those who heap infamy upon the city and to reward those who are responsible in some degree for the tributes paid to her, more than you reward the athletes who are crowned in the great games, seeing that they win for the city a greater and more fitting glory than any athlete;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] for in contests of the body we have many rivals; but in the training of the mind everyone would concede that we stand first. And men with even a slight ability to reason ought to show the world that they reward those who excel in those activities for which the city is renowned, and they ought not to envy them nor hold an opinion of them which is the opposite of the esteem in which they are held by the rest of the Hellenes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But you have never troubled yourselves to do this; nay, you have so far mistaken your true interests that you are more pleased with those who cause you to be reviled than with those who cause you to be praised, and you think that those who have made many people hate the city are better friends of the demos than those who have inspired good will toward Athens in all with whom they have had to deal.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If, however, you are wise, you will put an end to this confusion, and you will not continue, as now, to take either a hostile or a contemptuous view of philosophy; on the contrary, you will conceive that the cultivation of the mind is the noblest and worthiest of pursuits and you will urge our young men who have sufficient means and who are able to take the time for it to embrace an education and a training of this sort.

	they are willing to work hard and to prepare themselves to be of service to the city, you will make much of them; but when they give themselves to loose living and care for nothing else than to enjoy riotously what their fathers left to them, you will despise them and look upon them as false to the city and to the good name of their ancestors.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	Many ideas crowd into my thoughts, but I do not know how I can make place for them; for it seems to me that while every point which I have in mind would appeal to you if I presented it by itself, yet if I attempted to discuss them all at this time, I should put too great a strain both upon myself and upon my hearers. Indeed I fear that in what I have already said to you I may have fatigued you by speaking at such length. For we are all so insatiable in discourse that while we prize due measure and affirm that there is nothing so precious, yet when we think that we have something of importance to say, we throw moderation to the winds, and go on adding point after point until little by little we involve ourselves

	in utter irrelevancies. Why, at the very moment that I say this and recognize its truth, I desire, nevertheless, to speak to you at greater length! For I am grieved to see the sycophant’s trade faring better than philosophy—the one attacking, the other on the defensive. Who of the men of old could have anticipated that things would come to this pass, in Athens, of all places, where we more than others plume ourselves on our wisdom? Things were not like that in the time of our ancestors; on the contrary, they admired the sophists, as they called them, and envied the good fortune of their disciples, while they blamed the sycophants for most of their ills.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You will find the strongest proof of this in the fact that they saw fit to put Solon, who was the first of the Athenians to receive the title of sophist, at the head of the state, while they applied to the sycophants more stringent laws than to other criminals; for, while they placed the trial of the greatest crimes in the hands of a single one of the courts,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] against the sycophants they instituted indictments before the Thesmothetae, impeachments before the Senate, and plaints before the General Assembly, believing that those who plied this trade exceeded all other forms of villainy; for other criminals, at any rate, try to keep their evil-doing under cover, while these flaunt their brutality, their misanthropy, and their contentiousness before the eyes of all.

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]For example, a charge of deliberate murder could come
	only before the Court of the Areopagus. A charge against
	the sycophants, on the other hand, could be brought before
	the Thesmothetae (see 237, note), who prepared the case
	for trial before a Heliastic Court, in which case the charge
	was termed γραφή (indictment); or before the Senate of the Five Hundred, in which case the charge was called εἰσαγγελία (impeachment); or before the General Assembly, in which case the charge was termed προβολή (plaint). See Lipsius, [c dimgray]Das attische Recht[/c] pp. 176 ff. This was, however, true of so many crimes that the point of Isocrates is rather rhetorical.

	That was the way our ancestors felt about them. But you, so far from punishing the sycophants,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] actually set them up as accusers and legislators for the rest of the people. And yet there is reason for detesting them now more than at that time; for then it was only in matters of ordinary routine and in affairs confined to the city that they damaged their countrymen. In the meantime, however, the city waxed powerful and seized the empire of the Hellenes, and our fathers,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] growing more self-assured than was meet for them, began to look with disfavour on those good men and true who had made Athens great, envying them their power, and to crave instead men who were base-born and full of insolence, thinking that by their bravado and contentiousness they would be able to preserve the rule of the people,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] while because of the meanness of their origin they would not become overweening nor ambitious[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] to overturn the constitution.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And since this change has taken place, what calamity has not been visited upon the city? What great misfortunes have these depraved natures failed to bring to pass through their speech and through their actions? Have they not taunted the most illustrious of the Athenians—the men who were the best able to benefit the city—with oligarchical and

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]The term sycophant is applied here as elsewhere in

	[c dimgray]Areop.[/c] 50: τοῖς ὀλίγῳ πρὸ ἡμῶν), and especially after the
	death of Pericles. Aristotle ([c dimgray]Const. of Athens[/c] 28) states:
	“So long, however, as Pericles was leader of the people,
	things went tolerably well with the State; but when he
	was dead there was a great change for the worse. Then
	for the first time did the people choose a leader who was of
	no reputation among the people of good standing, whereas up to this time men of good standing were always found as leaders of the democracy” (Kenyon’s translation). Aristotle goes on to say that Pericles was followed by such leaders as Cleon, the tanner—insolent demagogues who vied with each other in pandering to the mob.

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The [c dimgray]Panathenaicus[/c] is the last of the “orations” of Isocrates and the last of his extant writings, excepting the brief letter to Philip,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] He began it in his ninety-fourth year,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] apparently not long before the celebration of the Greek Panathenaic Festival in the month Hecatombaeon (July-August), 342 b.c.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] He was moved to undertake this ambitious discourse at such an age partly by an impulse to justify himself against recent criticisms which had wounded his pride,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] but mainly by a desire to publish, probably on the occasion of the approaching Festival,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] a last testimonial to the glory of Athens[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]—her generous pan-Hellenism in days past in contrast to the selfish parochialism of Sparta.[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] He was not, however, able to publish this encomium as a contribution to that celebration. When it was half finished, his work was interrupted by a severe and lasting illness,[c dimgray][sup]h[/sup][/c] and it was not until three years later, when—to use his own words—he “had lived but three years less than a century,” that he was prevailed upon by the importunities of his friends to rise above his weakness and complete the discourse.[c dimgray][sup]i[/sup][/c] The [c dimgray]Panathenaicus[/c] was, therefore, issued

	It is not, then, surprising that the [c dimgray]Panathenaicus[/c] betrays the uncertain grasp of a trembling hand. It is surprising, rather, when we consider that much of the work of Isocrates was done after he had passed his eightieth year, that this discourse is the first to show the effects of old age. The [c dimgray]Peace[/c] and the [c dimgray]Areopagiticus[/c], produced when he was eighty-one, are among the most spirited and forceful of his writings; the [c dimgray]Antidosis[/c], published in the following year, shows a firm grasp in the handling of the subject; the [c dimgray]Philip[/c] and the [c dimgray]Archidamus[/c], both issued in his ninetieth year, bear no marks of senility; on the contrary, the [c dimgray]Archidamus[/c], particularly, reads like the production of a youthful mind.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But the [c dimgray]Panathenaicus[/c] gives evidence of the handicaps under which it was elaborated—that it was written “at a time of life and in a state of health wherein any one else, so far from attempting to compose anything of his own, would not be willing even to listen to a discourse worked out and submitted by another.’’[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At the beginning of the discourse, Isocrates warns his audience that it may appear “more feeble” than his early compositions because of its lack of the adornments of style.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] But it is not in this regard mainly that the [c dimgray]Panathenaicus[/c] is weaker than his other work. In fact it is not lacking in rhetorical devices, although these are less skilfully employed.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] But it is even more deficient in invention, arrangement and force. There is little said in the [c dimgray]Panathenaicus[/c] which is not

	better said in his other writings. The matter dealt with in the introduction—the exposition and defence of his teaching and writing against his detractors—is more effectively covered in the [c dimgray]Antidosis[/c], and the glorification of the past history of Athens—his central theme—suffers by comparison with the treatment of the same subject in the [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c], especially because of its diffuseness and repetition[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and lack of consistency.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	In one respect, the eulogy of the city of his fathers in the [c dimgray]Panathenaicus[/c] takes an original turn: in the sharp contrast drawn between the services of Athens to Greece and the disservices of Sparta.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Indeed this part of the discourse, lavish in its praises of Athens, is equally intemperate in its arraignment of Sparta, This Isocrates, himself, feels at the end. He regrets that in his review of Spartan history he had been offensively unjust,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and desires in some fashion to make amends to a state which now no less than when he wrote the [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c] he does not wish to repel from the cause of pan-Hellenism. But the device to which he resorts—the curious dialogue, if such may be termed the speeches which are exchanged between himself and one of his erstwhile pupils, who not only champions the Spartans but suggests that underneath the apparent abuse heaped upon them in this discourse there lies a hidden meaning which, if elucidated, is flattering to Spartan pride—has been, and will remain, one of the puzzles of literary criticism. There may, perhaps, be some foundation in fact for the “advice”[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] which Isocrates sought from his former pupils and received from that

Or it may be—and this seems more probable—that he invents this fiction of a debate in order to show that he also could see the other side. In any case, this epilogue, if not bordering upon ineptitude, is the least felicitous part of a discourse which throughout falls below the level of his best work.

And yet, although I have been blessed with all these gifts, some in surpassing, others in sufficient measure, I am not content to live on these terms; on the contrary, my old age is so morose and captious and discontented that I have

	But in spite of the fact that myself and these orators are so far apart in our ways of thinking and that I have chosen a field so much more worthy, the majority of people estimate us, not in accordance with our merits, but in a confused and altogether irrational manner. For they find fault with the character of the popular orators and yet put them at the head of affairs and invest them with power over the whole state; and, again, they praise my discourses and yet are envious of me personally for no other reason than because of these very discourses which they receive with favour. So unfortunately do I fare at their hands.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But why wonder at those who are by nature envious of all superior excellence, when certain even of those who regard themselves as superior and who seek to emulate me and imitate my work are more hostile to me than is the general public? And yet where in the world could you find men more reprehensible—for I shall speak my mind even at the risk of appearing to some to discourse with more vehemence and rancour than is becoming to my age—where, I say, could you find men more reprehensible than these, who are not able to put before their students even a fraction of what I have set forth in my teaching but use my discourses as models and make their living from so doing, and yet are so far from being grateful to me on this account that they are not even willing to let me alone but are always saying disparaging things about me?

	them at the wrong places, mutilating them, and in every way spoiling their effect, I paid no heed to the reports which were brought to me, but possessed myself in patience. However, a short time before the Great Panathenaia,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] they stirred me to great indignation. For some of my friends met me and related to me how, as they were sitting together in the Lyceum,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] three or four of the sophists of no repute—men who claim to know everything and are prompt to show their presence everywhere—were discussing the poets, especially the poetry of Hesiod and Homer, saying nothing original about them, but merely chanting their verses and repeating from memory the cleverest things which certain others had said about them in the past.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] It seems that the bystanders applauded their performance, whereupon one of these sophists, the boldest among them, attempted to stir up prejudice against me, saying that I hold all such things in contempt and that I would do away with all the learning and the teaching of others, and that I assert that all men talk mere drivel except those who partake of my instruction. And these aspersions, according to my friends, were effective in turning a number of those present against me.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now I could not possibly convey to you how troubled and disturbed I was on hearing that some accepted these statements as true. For I thought that it was so well known that I was waging war against the false pretenders to wisdom and that I had spoken so moderately, nay so modestly, about my

	own powers that no one could be credited for a moment who asserted that I myself resorted to such pretensions. But in truth it was with good reason that I deplored at the beginning of my speech the misfortune which has attended me all my life in this respect. For this is the cause of the false reports which are spread about me, of the calumny and prejudice which I suffer, and of my failure to attain the reputation which I deserve—either that which should be mine by common consent or that in which I am held by certain of my disciples who have known me through and through. However, this cannot now be changed and I must needs put up with what has already come to pass.

	Many things come to my mind, but I am at a loss just what to do. Should I turn upon my enemies and denounce those who are accustomed always to speak falsely of me and do not scruple to say things which are repugnant to my nature? But if I showed that I took them seriously and wasted many words on men whom no one conceives to be worthy of notice I should justly be regarded as a simpleton. Should I, then, ignore these sophists and defend myself against those of the lay public who are prejudiced against me, attempting to convince them that it is neither just nor fitting for them to feel towards me as they do? But who would not impute great folly to me, if, in dealing with men who are hostile to me for no other reason than that I appear to have discoursed cleverly on certain subjects, I thought that by speaking just as I have spoken in the past I should stop them from taking offence at what I say and should not instead

	[m1]\ [/m]
	But neither would anyone, I am sure, advise me to neglect this subject and, breaking off in the midst of it, to go on and finish the discourse which I elected to write in my desire to prove that our city had been the cause of more blessings to the Hellenes than the city of the Lacedaemonians. For if I should now proceed to do this without bringing what I have written to any conclusion and without joining the beginning of what is to be said to the end of what has been spoken, I should be thought to be no better than those who speak in a random, slovenly, and scattering manner whatever comes into their heads to say. And this I must guard against.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The best course, therefore, that I can take under all these conditions is to set before you what I think about the last attempts[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] to arouse prejudice against me and then proceed to speak on the subject which I had in mind from the first. For I think that if I succeed by my writing in bringing out and making clear what my views are about education and about the poets, I shall stop my enemies from fabricating false charges and speaking utterly at random.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now in fact, so far from scorning the education which was handed down by our ancestors, I even commend that which has been set up in our own day—I mean geometry, astronomy, and the so-called eristic dialogues,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] which our young men delight in

	more than they should, although among the older men not one would not declare them insufferable. Nevertheless, I urge those who are inclined towards these disciplines to work hard and apply themselves to all of them, saying that even if this learning can accomplish no other good, at any rate it keeps the young out of many other things which are harmful. Nay, I hold that for those who are at this age no more helpful or fitting occupation can be found than the pursuit of these studies; but for those who are older and for those who have been admitted to man’s estate I assert that these disciplines are no longer suitable. For I observe that some of those who have become so thoroughly versed in these studies as to instruct others in them fail to use opportunely the knowledge which they possess, while in the other activities of life they are less cultivated[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] than their students—I hesitate to say less cultivated than their servants. I have the same fault to find also with those who are skilled in oratory and those who are distinguished for their writings and in general with all who have superior attainments in the arts, in the sciences, and in specialized skill. For I know that the majority even of these men have not set their own house in order, that they are insupportable in their private intercourse, that they belittle the opinions of their fellow-citizens, and that they are given over to many other grave offences. So that I do not think that even these may be said to partake of the state of culture of which I am speaking.

	Whom, then, do I call educated, since I exclude the arts and sciences and specialties? First, those who

Those who have a character which is in accord, not with one of these things, but with all of them—these, I contend, are wise and complete men, possessed of all the virtues.

	These then are the views which I hold regarding educated men. As to the poetry of Homer and Hesiod and the rest, I would fain speak—for I think that I could silence those who chant their verses and prate about these poets in the Lyceum—but I perceive that I am being carried beyond the due limits which have been assigned to an introduction; and it behoves a man of taste not to indulge his resourcefulness,

But I do not fail to appreciate how great an undertaking this is for me at my time of life; on the contrary, I know full well, and have often said,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] that while it is easy to magnify little things by means of discourse, it is difficult to find terms of praise to match deeds of surpassing magnitude and excellence. Nevertheless, I may not desist on that account from my task, but must carry it through to the end, if indeed I am enabled to live to do so, especially since many considerations impel me to write upon this theme myself: first, is the fact that some are in the habit of recklessly denouncing our city; second, that while some have praised her gracefully, they have lacked appreciation of their theme and treated it inadequately; furthermore, that others have not scrupled rather to glorify her, not in human terms, but so extravagantly as to arouse the hostility of many against them; and, lastly, there is the fact of my

	I have now finished what I wished to say by way of prelude[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] about myself and others, like a chorus, as it were, before the contest. But I think that those who wish to be exact and just in praising any given state ought not to confine themselves alone to the state which they single out, but even as we examine purple and gold and test them by placing them side by side with articles of similar appearance and of the same estimated value, so also in the case of states one should compare, not those which are small with those which are great, nor those which are always subject to others with those which are wont to dominate others, nor those which stand in need of succour with those which are able to give it, but rather those which have similar powers, and have engaged in the same deeds and enjoyed a like freedom of action. For thus one may best arrive at the truth.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If, then, one views Athens in this light and compares her, not with any city chosen at random, but with the city of the Spartans, which most people praise moderately while some[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] extol her as though the demigods had there governed the state, then Athens, in her power, in her deeds and in her benefactions

	Of the ancient struggles which they have undergone in behalf of the Hellenes, I shall speak hereafter.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Now, however, I shall begin with the time when the Lacedaemonians conquered the cities of Achaea[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and divided their territory with the Argives and the Messenians; for it is fitting to begin discussing them at this point.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now our ancestors will be seen to have preserved without ceasing the spirit of concord towards the Hellenes and of hatred towards the barbarians which they inherited from the Trojan War and to have remained steadfast in this policy. First they took the islands of the Cyclades,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] about which there had been much contention during the overlordship of Minos of Crete and which finally were occupied by the Carians,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and, having driven out the latter, refrained from appropriating the lands of these islands for themselves, but instead settled upon them those of the Hellenes who were most lacking in means of subsistence. And after this, they founded many great cities on both continents,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] swept the barbarians back from the sea, and taught the Hellenes in what way they should manage their own countries and against whom they should wage war in order to make Hellas great.

	policy as our ancestors—from waging war on the barbarians and benefiting the Hellenes—that they were not even willing to refrain from aggression, but although they held an alien city and a territory not only adequate but greater than any other city of Hellas possessed, they were not satisfied with what they had; on the contrary, having learned from the actual course of events that while according to law states and territories are deemed to belong to those who have duly and lawfully acquired them, in fact, however, they fall into the hands of those who are most practised in the art of warfare and are able to conquer their enemies in battle—thinking upon these things, they neglected agriculture and the arts and everything else and did not cease laying siege to the cities in the Peloponnesus one by one and doing violence to them until they overthrew them all with the exception of Argos.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And so it resulted from the policy which we pursued that Hellas waxed great, Europe became stronger than Asia, and, furthermore, the Hellenes who were in straitened circumstances received cities and lands, while the barbarians who were wont to be insolent were expelled from their own territory and humbled in their pride; whereas the results of the Spartan policy were that their city alone became strong, dominated all the cities in the Peloponnesus, inspired fear in the other states, and was courted by them for her favour. In justice, however, we should praise the city which has been the author of many blessings to the rest of the world but should reprehend the state which is ever striving to effect its own advantage; and we should cultivate the friendship

	Such was the beginning made by each of these two states. But at a later time, when the Persian War took place[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] (Xerxes, who was then king, having gathered together a fleet of thirteen hundred triremes and a land force numbering five millions in all, including seven hundred thousand fighting men, and led this vast force[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] against the Hellenes), the Spartans, although they were masters of the Peloponnesus, contributed to the sea-fight which determined the issue of the whole war only ten triremes, whereas our ancestors, although they were homeless, having abandoned Athens[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] because the city had not been fortified with walls at that time, furnished not only a greater number of ships, but ships with a greater fighting force, than all the rest combined who fought together in that battle.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Again, the Lacedaemonians contributed to this battle the leadership of Eurybiades, who, had he carried into effect what he intended to do, could have been prevented by nothing in the world from bringing destruction upon the Hellenes, whereas the Athenians furnished Themistocles, who, by the common assent of all, was credited with being responsible for the victorious outcome of that battle as well as for all the other successes which were achieved during that time.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] And the greatest

	proof of this is that those who then fought together took the hegemony away from the Lacedaemonians and conferred it upon our ancestors.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] And yet what more competent or trustworthy judges could one find of what then took place than those who had a part in those very struggles? And what benefaction could one mention greater than that which was able to save all Hellas?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now after these events it came about that each of these cities in turn gained the empire of the sea[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—a power such that whichever state possesses it holds in subjection most of the states of Hellas.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] As to their use of this power in general, I commend neither Athens nor Sparta; for one might find many faults with both. Nevertheless, in this supervision[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] the Athenians surpassed the Lacedaemonians no less than in the deeds which I have just mentioned. For our fathers tried to persuade their allies to establish the very same polity in their cities as they themselves had continually cherished;[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and it is a sign of good will and friendship when any people urge it upon others to use those institutions which they conceive to be beneficial to themselves. The Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, set up in their subject states a polity which resembled neither that which obtained among themselves nor those which have existed anywhere else in the world; nay, they vested in ten men[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] alone the government of each of the states—men of such a character that were one to attempt to denounce them for three or four days without pause he would appear to have covered not a fraction of the wrongs which have been perpetrated

	by them. To attempt to review these wrongs in detail were foolish; they are so many and so grave. Were I a younger man, I might perhaps have found means to characterize all of their crimes in a few words which would have stirred in my hearers an indignation commensurate with the gravity of the things which these men have done; but as it is, no such words occur to me other than those which are on the lips of all men, namely, that they so far outdid all those who lived before their time in lawlessness and greed that they not only ruined themselves and their friends and their own countries but also brought the Lacedaemonians into evil repute with their allies and plunged them into misfortunes so many and so grave as no one could have dreamed would ever be visited upon them.

	You can see at once from this instance best of all how much milder and more moderate we were in our supervision over the affairs of the Hellenes, but you can see it also from what I shall now say. The Spartans remained at the head of Hellas hardly ten years,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] while we held the hegemony without interruption for sixty-five years.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] And yet it is known to all that states which come under the supremacy of others remain loyal for the longest time to those under which they suffer the least degree of oppression. Now both Athens and Lacedaemon incurred the hatred of their subjects and were plunged into war and confusion, but in these circumstances it will be found that our city, although attacked by all the Hellenes and by the barbarians as well, was able to

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Isocrates elsewhere views the Spartan supremacy as
	lasting from the end of the Peloponnesian War, 405–404 b.c.,
	to the battle of Leuctra, 371 b.c. See [c dimgray]Phil.[/c] 47. But later in
	[c dimgray]Phil.[/c] 63–64 he speaks of Conon’s naval victory at the battle
	of Cnidus, 394 b.c., as the end of the Spartan rule, since it
	re-established the maritime influence of Athens. The latter
	is the version followed here. It is reasonable to say that Sparta’s supremacy by sea ceased with the battle of Cnidus and her supremacy by land with Leuctra.

	Again, I must set forth how these two cities demeaned themselves toward the barbarians;[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] for this still remains to be done.

Well then, does not the city which made the nobler and prouder covenants with the Persian king, which brought to pass the most and the greatest injuries to the barbarians and benefits to the Hellenes, which, furthermore, seized from her foes the sea-coast of Asia and much other territory besides and appropriated it to her allies, which put an end to the insolence of the barbarians and the poverty of the Hellenes, and which, besides, waged war in her own

	cause more capably than that city which is famed for her skill in warfare, and extricated herself from her misfortunes more quickly than these same Lacedaemonians-—does not this city, I say, deserve to be praised and honoured more than the state which has been outdistanced by her in all these respects?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This, then, is what I had in mind to say on this occasion in comparing the achievements of Athens and Lacedaemon and the wars which they fought at the same time and against the same adversaries. But I think that, while those who find these words distasteful to listen to will not deny that what I have said is the truth nor, again, will they be able to cite other activities of the Lacedaemonians through which they brought to pass many blessings to the Hellenes, yet they will attempt—as is ever their habit—to denounce our city, to recount the most offensive acts which occurred while she held the empire of the sea, to present in a false light the adjudication of law-suits in Athens for the allies[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and her collection of tribute[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] from them, and above all to dwell on the cruelties suffered at her hands by the Melians and the Scionians and the Toronians,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] thinking by these reproaches to sully the benefactions of Athens which I have just described. Now I, for my part, could not gainsay all the things which might justly be said against our city, nor would I attempt to do so; for I should be ashamed, as I have already said in another place,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] when all other men

	are of the opinion that not even the gods are free from guilt, were I to strain my conscience and attempt to persuade you that our commonwealth has never erred in any instance whatsoever. Nevertheless, I think I shall do one thing, namely, show that the city of the Spartans, in handling situations such as I have mentioned, has been much more harsh and severe than Athens, and that those who seek to promote the reputation of the Spartans by calumniating us are short-sighted in the extreme and are themselves to blame for the bad repute which their own friends[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] incur at our hands. For whenever they make such charges against us, to which the Lacedaemonians are more open than ourselves, we do not find it difficult to cite against Sparta a graver offence in each case than that which has been charged against Athens.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For example, in the present instance, if they bring up the fact that the law-suits of the allies were tried in Athens, is there anyone so slow of wit as not to find the ready retort that the Lacedaemonians have put to death without trial more of the Hellenes[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] than have ever been brought to trial and judgement here since the founding of our city?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And if they make any complaint about our collection of the tribute, we shall be ready with a like rejoinder. For we shall show that our ancestors far more than the Lacedaemonians acted for the advantage of the states which paid them tribute. For, in the first place, these states did this, not because we had so commanded, but because they themselves had so resolved at the very time when they conferred upon us the supremacy by sea. In the next place, they paid their quotas, not to preserve Athens, but to preserve their own democratic polity and their own

And, more than that, they paid these contributions, not from funds which they had treasured up through their own efforts, but from resources which they possessed through our aid.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] In return for these resources, had they reflected in the slightest degree, they should in all fairness have been grateful to us; for we took over their cities in some instances when they had been utterly destroyed, in others when they had been sacked and plundered by the barbarians, and advanced them to such a state of prosperity that although they contributed to us a slight proportion of the wealth which flowed in upon them, their estates were no less prosperous than those of the Peloponnesians who paid no tribute whatsoever.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Furthermore, as to the cities which were laid waste under the rule of each of these states—a matter for which certain men reproach the Athenians alone—we shall show that things much more reprehensible were done by those whom these men are never weary of extolling. For it happened that we offended against islets so small and insignificant that many of the Hellenes do not even know of their existence, whereas the Lacedaemonians laid waste the greatest cities of the Peloponnesus—states which in every way were eminent above the others—and now hold for themselves the wealth of those states which, even supposing that in former times they possessed no merit, deserved the greatest possible rewards from

	the Hellenes because of the expedition against Troy in which they took the foremost place and furnished as its leaders men possessed not only of the virtues in which many of the common run of mankind have a part, but also of those in which no ignoble man may share. For Messene furnished Nestor, the wisest of all who lived in those times; Lacedaemon, Menelaus, who because of his moderation and his justice was the one man to be deemed worthy to become the son-in-law of Zeus;[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and Argos, Agamemnon, who was possessed, not of one or two of the virtues merely, but of all which anyone can name—and these, not in moderate, but in surpassing degree. For we shall find that no one in all the world has ever undertaken deeds more distinctive, more noble, more important, more advantageous to the Hellenes, or deserving of higher praise. These are facts which, when thus barely enumerated, some may not unreasonably question, but when they have been supported in each instance by a few words, all men will acknowledge that I speak the truth.

	However, I am not able to see clearly, but am in doubt, with what words I may proceed without making an error of judgement. For, on the one hand, I am ashamed, after having said so much about the virtue of Agamemnon, to make no mention of the things which he accomplished and so to seem to my hearers no different from men who make empty boasts and say whatever comes into their heads. But I observe, on the other hand, that the discussion of things which

Therefore I fear that I too may subject myself to some such criticism. Nevertheless, I elect to lend support to the man who has experienced the same misadventure as myself and many others and failed of the reputation he deserved, and who has been the author of the greatest services to the world of his time, albeit he is less praised than those who have done nothing worthy of mention.

	For what element of glory did he lack who won a position of such exalted honour that, were all the world to unite on the search for a greater, no greater could be found? For he is the only man who was ever deemed worthy to be the leader of the armies of all Hellas. Whether he was elected by all or obtained this honour by himself, I am not able to say. But however this came about, he left no room for the rest of mankind who have in any wise won distinction since his time to surpass the glory which attaches to his name. And when he obtained this power, he harmed no city of Hellas; nay, so far was he from injuring any one of them that, although he took command of the Hellenes when they were in a state of mutual warfare and confusion and great misfortune, he delivered them from this condition, and, having established concord among them, indifferent to all exploits which are extravagant and spectacular and of no benefit to others, he collected the Hellenes into an army and led them forth against the barbarians.

But although he achieved all this and set this example to the rest of the world, he did not receive the fame which was his due, because of those who delight more in stage-play than in services and in fiction than in truth; nay, albeit he proved himself so great, he has a reputation which is less than that of men who have not ventured even to imitate his example.

For he conceived of his mission in terms so lofty that he was not satisfied with making up his army from all the men in private station whom he desired to have from each of the cities of Hellas, but even persuaded men of the rank of kings, who were accustomed to do in their own states whatsoever they pleased and to give orders to the world at large, to place themselves under his command, to follow him against whomsoever he might lead them, to obey his orders, to abandon their royal manner of living and to share the life of soldiers in the field, and, furthermore, to imperil themselves and wage war, not for their own countries and kingdoms, but ostensibly for Helen, wife of Menelaus, though in reality for Hellas,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] that she might not again suffer such an outrage at the hands of the barbarians nor such as befel her before that time in the seizure of the entire Peloponnesus by Pelops or of Argos by Danaus or of Thebes by Cadmus.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] For what other

	There is, moreover, connected with the above achievement one which, though less significant than those which I have mentioned, is more important and more deserving of mention than those which have been extolled again and again. For he commanded an army which had come together from all the cities of Hellas, a host whose size may be imagined since it contained many of the descendants of the gods and of the direct sons of the gods[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—men who were not of the same temper as the majority of mankind nor on the same plane of thinking, but full of pride and passion and envy and ambition—, and yet he held that army together for ten years, not by great bribes nor by outlays of money, by which means all rulers nowadays maintain their power,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] but by the supremacy of his genius, by his ability to provide from the enemy subsistence for his soldiers, and most of all by his reputation of being better advised in the interest of others than others in their own interest.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But the final achievement by which he crowned all these is no less worthy of admiration. For he will be found to have done nothing unseemly or unworthy of these exploits which I have already described; on the contrary, although he waged war, ostensibly against a single city, but in reality not only against all the peoples who dwelt in Asia but also against many other races of the barbarians, he did not give up fighting nor depart for home before reducing to slavery the city of him who had offended against

	I am well aware of the space which I have given to the praises of Agamemnon’s virtue; I am well aware also that if any of you should go over these one by one, many as they are, to see what might be rejected, no one would venture to subtract a single word, and yet I know that when they are read one after the other, all will criticize me for having said much more than I should. For my part, if I inadvertently prolonged this topic I should be ashamed of being so lacking in perception when discoursing on a subject which no one has even ventured to discuss. But in fact I knew much better than those who will dare to take me to task that many will criticize this excess. I considered, however, that it would be less objectionable to be thought by some to disregard due measure in this part of my discourse than to leave out, in speaking of such a man, any of the merits which belong to him and which it behoves me to mention. I thought also that I should be applauded by the most cultivated of my hearers if I could show that I was more concerned when discoursing on the subject of virtue about doing justice to the theme than about the symmetry of my speech—and that too, knowing well that the lack of due proportion in my speech would detract from my own reputation, while just appreciation of their deeds would enhance the fame of those whose praises I sing. Nevertheless I bade farewell to expediency and chose justice instead. And you will find that I am of this mind not only in what I am now saying but likewise upon all occasions, since it will be seen that I take more pleasure in those of my disciples who are distinguished

For I think that I now see the point from which I strayed. I was speaking in reply to those who reproach us with the misfortunes of the Melians and of villages with like populations, not meaning that we had done no wrong in these instances, but trying to show that those who are the idols of these speakers have laid waste more and greater cities than the Athenians have done, in which connexion I discussed the virtues of Agamemnon and Menelaus and Nestor, saying nothing that was not true, though passing, mayhap, the bounds of moderation. But I did this, supposing that it would be apparent that there could be no greater crime than that of those who dared lay waste the cities which bred and reared such great men, about whom even now one might say many noble things.

	But it is perhaps foolish to linger upon a single point, as if there were any lack, as if there were not, on the contrary, a superabundance of things to say about the cruelty and the harshness of the Lacedaemonians.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For the Lacedaemonians were not satisfied with wronging these cities and men of this character, but treated in the same way those who had set out with them from the same country, joined with them in the same expedition, and shared with them the same perils[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—I mean the Argives and the Messenians. For they determined to plunge these also into the very same misfortunes which had been visited upon their former victims.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] They did not cease laying siege to the Messenians until they had driven them from their territory, and with the same object they are even now making war upon the Argives.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Furthermore, it would be strange if, having spoken of these wrongs, I failed to mention their treatment of the Plataeans. It was on the soil of Plataea that the Lacedaemonians had encamped with us and with the other allies, drawn up for battle against our enemies;[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] there they had offered sacrifices to the deities worshipped by the Plataeans;[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and there we had won freedom, not only for the Hellenes who fought with us, but also for those who were compelled to be on the side of the Persians,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] and we accomplished this with the help of the Plataeans, who alone of the Boeotians fought with us in that war.[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] And yet, after no great interval of time, the

	Little did Athens resemble Sparta in the treatment of these peoples; for, while the Lacedaemonians did not scruple to commit such wrongs both against the benefactors of Hellas and against their own kinsmen,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] our ancestors, on the other hand, gave the surviving Messenians a home in Naupactus[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and adopted the Plataeans who had escaped with their lives as Athenian citizens and shared with them all the privileges which they themselves enjoyed.[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] So that if we had nothing else to say about these two cities, it is easy to judge from these instances what was the character of each and which of the two laid waste more and greater cities.

	character that it is neither honourable nor possible to leave out the kind of facts from which it can be proved that our city has been of greater service to the Hellenes than Lacedaemon, I must not be silent either about the other wrongs which have not yet been told, albeit they have been done among the Hellenes, but must show that our ancestors have been slow pupils[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in wrong-doing, whereas the Lacedaemonians have in some respects been the first to point the way and in others have been the sole offenders.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now most people upbraid both cities because, while pretending that they risked the perils of war against the barbarians for the sake of the Hellenes, they did not in fact allow the various states to be independent and manage their own affairs in whatever way was expedient for each of them, but, on the contrary, divided them up, as if they had taken them captive in war, and reduced them all to slavery, acting no differently than those who rob others of their slaves, on the pretext of liberating them, only to compel them to slave for their new masters.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But it is not the fault of the Athenians that these complaints are made and many others more bitter than these, but rather of those who now in what is being said, as in times past in all that has been done, have been in the opposite camp from us. For no man can show that our ancestors during the countless years of our early history ever attempted to impose our rule over any city great or small, whereas all men know that the Lacedaemonians, from the time when they entered the Peloponnesus, have had no other object in their deeds or in their designs than to impose their rule if possible over all men but, failing that, over the peoples of the Peloponnesus.

	And as to the stirring up of faction and slaughter and revolution in these cities, which certain critics impute both to Athens and to Sparta, you will find that the Lacedaemonians have filled all the states, excepting a very few, with these misfortunes and afflictions,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] whereas no one would dare even to allege that our city, before the disaster which befel her in the Hellespont,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] ever perpetrated such a thing among her allies. But when the Lacedaemonians, after having been in the position of dictators over the Hellenes, were being driven from control of affairs—at that juncture, when the other cities were rent by faction, two or three of our generals (I will not hide the truth from you) mistreated some of them, thinking that if they should imitate the deeds of Spartans they would be better able to control them.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Therefore all may justly charge the Lacedaemonians with having been the instigators and teachers of such deeds, but may with good reason make allowance for us, as for pupils who have been deceived by the false promises of their tutors and disappointed in their expectations.

	I come now finally to those offences which they alone and by themselves committed.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] Who does not know that the Spartans, notwithstanding that they and we harbour in common a feeling of hatred towards the barbarians and their kings, and notwithstanding that the Athenians, although beset by many wars and involved at times in great disasters, their territory

	being often ravaged and cut off by the enemy,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] never once turned their eyes towards friendship and alliance with the barbarians, but continued steadfastly to cherish a stronger hatred against them because of what they plotted against the Hellenes than we feel towards those who now seek to injure Athens—who does not know, I say, that the Spartans, although untroubled by any evil or even by any prospect or fear of evil, advanced to such a pitch of greed that they were not satisfied to hold the supremacy by land, but were so greedy to obtain also the empire of the sea that at one and the same time they were inciting our allies to revolt, undertaking to liberate them from our power, and were negotiating with the Persian king a treaty of friendship and alliance,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] promising to give over to him all the Hellenes who dwelt on the Asiatic coast? And yet, after they had given these pledges both to our allies and to the King and had conquered us in war, they reduced those whom they had sworn to set free to a state of slavery worse than that of the Helots,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and they returned the favour of the King in such wise that they persuaded Cyrus, his younger brother, to dispute the throne with him, and collected an army to support Cyrus, placing Clearchus at its head, and dispatched it against the King.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] But having failed in this treachery and betrayed their purposes to the world and made themselves hated by all mankind, they were plunged into such a state of warfare and confusion as men should expect after having played false with both the Hellenes and the barbarians.

	further about them except that after they had been defeated in the naval battle[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] by the forces of the King and by the leadership of Conon they made a peace[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] of such a character that no one can point out in all history one more shameful, more reprehensible, more derogatory to the Hellenes, or more contradictory to what is said by certain eulogists of the virtue of the Lacedaemonians. For when the King had established them as masters over the Hellenes, they attempted to rob him of his kingdom and of all his good fortune, but when the King defeated them in battle on the sea and humbled them, they gave over to him, not a small contingent of the Hellenes, but all those who dwelt in Asia, explicitly writing into the treaty that he should do with these according to his pleasure; and they were not ashamed of entering into such covenants regarding men by whose help as allies they prevailed over us, became masters of the Hellenes, and expected to subdue the whole of Asia; on the contrary, they inscribed such covenants in their own temples[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and compelled their allies to do the same.

	said, and these arguments I think I shall find ready at hand. For of those who applaud all the actions of the Lacedaemonians, the best and the most discerning will, I think, commend the polity of the Spartans and remain of the same opinion about it as before, but will concede the truth of what I have said about the things which they have done to the Hellenes. Those, however, who are inferior not only to these but to the great majority of men and who could not speak tolerably about any other subject, albeit they are not able to keep silent about the Lacedaemonians, but expect that if they extol them extravagantly they will gain a reputation equal to those who are reputed abler and much better than themselves—these men, when they perceive that all the topics have been covered and find themselves unable to gainsay a single point which I have made, will, I think, turn their attention to the question of polities, comparing the institutions of Sparta and of Athens, and especially their sobriety and discipline with our carelessness and slackness, and will eulogize the Spartans on these grounds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If, however, they attempt anything of the sort, all intelligent men should condemn them as speaking beside the point. For I undertook my subject with the avowed purpose, not of discussing polities, but of proving that our city has been of much greater service to the Hellenes than has the city of the Lacedaemonians.

For I think that I shall prove that in this very matter our city has excelled more than in those which I have already mentioned.

	And let no one suppose that I have said these things with reference to our present polity, which we were forced by circumstances to adopt, but rather with reference to the polity of our ancestors,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] from which our fathers[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] changed over to that which is now in force, not because they condemned the older polity—on the contrary, for the other activities of the state they preferred it as much superior—, but because they considered that for the exercise of supremacy by sea this polity was more expedient by adopting which and wisely administering it they were able to fend off both the plots of the Spartans and the armed forces of all the Peloponnesians, over whom it was of vital import to Athens, especially at that time, to have the upper hand in war. So that no one could justly condemn those who chose our present polity.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] For they were not disappointed in their expectations, nor were they at all blind to both the good and the bad features attached to either form of rule, but, on the contrary, saw clearly that while a land-power is fostered by order and sobriety and discipline and other like qualities,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] a sea-power is not augmented by these but by the crafts which have to

	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]This making a virtue of necessity is inconsistent with Isocrates’ uncompromising attitude toward the excesses of the later democracy in the [c dimgray]Areopagiticus[/c], the [c dimgray]Peace[/c], and even in this discourse. See 145 ff.

	do with the building of ships and by men who are able to row them—men who have lost their own possessions and are accustomed to derive their livelihood from the possessions of others.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Our fathers did not fail to foresee that with the introduction of these elements into the state the order and discipline of the former polity would be relaxed[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and that the good will of our allies would soon undergo a change when the Athenians should compel the Hellenes, to whom they had previously given lands and cities, to pay contributions and tribute to Athens in order that she might have the means to pay the kind of men whom I mentioned a moment ago. Nevertheless, although they were not blind to any of the things which I have mentioned, they considered that it was both advantageous and becoming to a state so great in size and reputation to bear with all difficulties rather than with the rule of the Lacedaemonians. For having the choice between two policies, neither of them ideal, they considered it better to choose to do injury to others rather than to suffer injury themselves and to rule without justice over others rather than, by seeking to escape that reproach, to be subject unjustly to the Lacedaemonians—a course which all sensible men would prefer and desire for themselves,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] albeit a certain few of those who claim to be wise men, were the question put to them, would not accept this view.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	I shall now proceed to speak about the polity which I took for my subject and about our ancestors, going back to the early times when neither the word oligarchy nor the word democracy was as yet in our speech, but when monarchies governed both the barbaric races and all the Hellenic states. I have chosen to begin with a period rather remote for these reasons: first, because I consider that those who lay claim to superior excellence ought from the very beginning of their race to be distinguished above all others,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and, second, because I should be ashamed if, having spoken at undue length of men who, though noble,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] are nowise akin to me, I should not even briefly mention those of our ancestors who most excellently governed our city, since they were as much superior to those who rule with absolute power as the wisest and gentlest of mankind may be said to excel the wildest and the most savage of the beasts.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	For what among crimes that are unparalleled in their wickedness and cruelty shall we not find to have been perpetrated in the other states and especially in those which at the time of which I am speaking were considered the greatest and even now are so reputed? Has there not abounded in them murder of brothers and fathers and guest-friends; matricide and incest and begetting of children by sons with their own mothers; feasting of a father on the flesh

	of his own sons, plotted by those nearest of kin; exposure of infants by parents, and drownings and Windings[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and other iniquities so many in number that no lack of material has ever been felt by those who are wont each year to present in the theatre[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] the miseries which occurred in those days?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I have recounted these atrocities with the desire, not of maligning these states, but of showing not only that nothing of the sort happened among the Athenians—for this would be a proof, not of their superior excellence, but merely that they were not of the same character as those who have proved themselves the most godless of men. However, those who undertake to praise any people in superlative terms must show, not only that they were not depraved, but that they excelled in all the virtues both those who lived at that time and those who are now living—which is the very claim that one may make for our ancestors. For they administered both the affairs of the state and their own affairs as righteously and honourably as was to be expected of men who were descended from the gods,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] who were the first to found a city and to make use of laws,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] who at all times had practised reverence in relation to the gods and justice in relation to mankind, who were neither of mixed origin nor invaders of a foreign territory but were, on the contrary, alone among the Hellenes, sprung from the soil itself,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Most of these horrors are taken from the Argive legend
	of the house of Pelops and the Theban story of the house of
	Labdacus: from the former, Thyestes feasting unwittingly
	upon the flesh of his own sons, served up to him by his
	brother, Atreus; from the latter, Oedipus exposed as a child
	by his parents to perish in the mountains, the slaying of
	Laius, his father, by Oedipus, the marriage of Oedipus to
	his own mother, Jocasta, the death at each other’s hands of
	the sons, Eteocles and Polyneices, who were born of that
	incestuous union, and the blinding of Oedipus.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]These stories furnished largely the themes of the tragic poets.
	[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]According to one story it was from the seeds sown by Hephaestus on the soil of Attica that the Athenians were sprung. See Aeschylus, [c dimgray]Eumenides[/c] 13.

	possessing in this land the nurse of their very existence and cherishing it as fondly as the best of children cherish their fathers and mothers, and who, furthermore, were so beloved of the gods that—what is of all things in the world the most difficult and rare, namely, to find examples of royal houses or houses of absolute rulers remaining in power through four or five generations—this too occurred among our ancestors alone. For Erichthonius, the son of Hephaestus and Earth, took over from Cecrops, who was without male descent, his house and kingdom; and beginning with this time all those who came after him—not a few in number—handed down their possessions and their powers to their sons until the reign of Theseus.

	of the state, he disdained all this and chose the glory which, in consequence of his labours and his struggles, would be remembered for all time in preference to the ease and felicity which, because of his royal power, were at his command for the term of his life. And he did this, not after he had grown old and had taken his pleasure in the good things at hand, but in the prime of his manhood, it is said, he gave over the state to the people to govern,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] while he himself risked his life without ceasing for the benefit of Athens and of the rest of the Hellenes.

	I have now touched upon the nobility of Theseus so far as I could on the present occasion, having formerly with some pains detailed his whole career. But as to those who took over the administration of the state, which he gave over to them, I am at a loss to know by what terms of praise I can adequately extol the genius of those men who, having no experience of governments, did not err in their choice of that polity which all the world would acknowledge to be not only the most impartial and the most just, but also the most profitable to all and the most agreeable to those who lived under it. For they established government by the people, not the kind which operates at haphazard, mistaking licence for liberty and freedom to do what one likes for happiness,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] but the kind which frowns upon such excesses and makes use of the rule of the best. Now the majority count the rule of the best,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] which is the most advantageous of governments (just as they do government based upon a property qualification[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]), among the

	distinct kinds of polity, being mistaken, not because of ignorance, but because they have never taken any interest in the things which should claim their attention. But I, for my part, hold that there are three types of polity and three only: oligarchy, democracy, and monarchy,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and that of the people who live under these all who are wont to place in charge of their offices and of their affairs in general those of their fellow-citizens who are most competent and who will most ably and justly direct the affairs of state—all these, I hold, will govern well, under any type of polity, both in their domestic relations and in their relations to the rest of the world. On the other hand, when men employ in these positions of leadership those of their citizens who are the most brazen and the most depraved and who take no thought for the things which are advantageous to the commonwealth but are ready to go to any extreme to further their personal advantage, the character of their government will correspond to the depravity of the men at the head of their affairs. Again, all who are not of the latter class nor of that which I mentioned previously, but who, when they feel secure, honour before others those who speak for the gratification of the public and, when they are afraid, seek refuge in the best and wisest of their citizens—such men will fare now worse now better as the case may be.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This, then, is the truth regarding the natures and powers of the several polities—a theme which will, I think, furnish to others material for much more extended discussion, although I must not speak
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Plato, [c dimgray]Republic[/c] 544c ff., distinguishes these three types:
	monarchy, which may be either a constitutional or an absolute
	rule; government by the few, which may be either an
	aristocracy or an oligarchy; and democracy. Aristotle,
	[c dimgray]Politics[/c] iii. 6 ff., recognizes three types: monarchy, aristocracy,
	and a republic, and, corresponding to them (aberrations
	from them), three debased forms, tyranny, oligarchy,
	and democracy. Isocrates’ point is that any one of these forms may be an aristocracy; it is the spirit of the constitution which matters (138); that government is best ([c dimgray]i.e[/c]. an aristocracy) where the best men rule.

	further on the general subject but must confine myself to the polity of our ancestors. For I undertook to prove that this has been of greater worth and the source of greater benefits than the polity which obtains in Sparta. And what I say on this head will prove, for those who would gladly hear me discuss an excellent polity, neither burdensome nor untimely but of due measure and in keeping with what I have said before; those, however, who take pleasure, not in the things which have been spoken in deep seriousness, but rather in the orators who rail at each other most of all at the public assemblies, or, if the speakers refrain from this madness, in those who deliver encomiums on the most trivial things[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] or on the most lawless men who have ever lived—to these, I think, what I say will seem much longer than it should be. I, however, have never concerned myself in the least with such auditors, any more than do other sensible men, but rather with those who will keep in mind what I said in preface to my whole discourse and at the same time will not frown upon the length of my speech, even though it extend through thousands upon thousands of words, but will realize that it lies in their power to read and peruse only such portion of it as they themselves desire; and most of all am I concerned with those who, in preference to any other, will gladly listen to a discourse which celebrates the virtues of men and the ways of a well-governed state. For if any should have the wish and the power to pattern their lives upon such examples, they might themselves pass their days in the enjoyment of high repute and render their own countries happy and prosperous.

	Now I have expressed myself as to the kind of auditors I would pray that I might have for what I shall say, but I am afraid that were I given such an audience I might fall far below the subject upon which I am to speak. Nevertheless, in such manner as I can I shall attempt to discourse upon it. The fact, then, that our city was governed in those times better than the rest of the world I would justly credit to her kings, of whom I spoke a moment ago. For it was they who trained the multitude in the ways of virtue and justice and great sobriety and who taught through the manner of their rule the very truth which I shall be seen to have expressed in words after they had expressed it in their deeds, namely, that every polity is the soul of the state, having as much power over it as the mind over the body. For it is this which deliberates on all questions, seeking to preserve what is good and to avoid what is disastrous,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and is the cause of all the things which transpire in states.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Having learned this truth, the people did not forget it on account of the change in the constitution, but rather gave their minds to this one endeavour before all others: to obtain as their leaders men who were in sympathy with democracy, but were possessed of the same character as those who were formerly at the head of the state; and not unwittingly to place in charge of the whole commonwealth men to whom no one would entrust a single detail of his private interests;[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and not to permit men to approach positions of public trust who are notoriously depraved; and not even to suffer men to be heard[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] who lend their own persons to base practices but deem themselves

	would, when by themselves, no matter in what regions of the world or on what enterprise engaged, be of the same way of thinking. And in this they were justified by events. For because they followed this principle they saw their code of laws completely written down in a few days—laws, not like those which are established to-day, nor full of so much confusion and of so many contradictions that no one can distinguish between the useful and the useless, but, in the first place, few in number, though adequate for those who were to use them and easy to comprehend; and, in the next place, just and profitable and consonant with each other; those laws, moreover, which had to do with their common ways of life having been thought out with greater pains than those which had to do with private contracts, as indeed they should be in well regulated states.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

For the men who had been elected to office were required to neglect their own possessions and at the same time to abstain no less from the gratuities which are wont to be given to the offices than from the treasures of the gods.

So that no one of the citizens felt about the offices as they now do, but they then sought to escape from them much more than they now seek to obtain them, and all men were agreed that no truer democracy could be found, nor one more stable or more beneficial to the multitude, than that which gave to the people at the same time exemption from such cares and sovereign power to fill the offices and bring to justice those who offended in them[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—exactly the position which is enjoyed also by the most fortunate among despots.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And the greatest proof that they were even better satisfied with this regime than I say is this: We see the people at war with other polities which fail to please them, overturning them and slaying those at their head, but continuing to enjoy this polity for not less than a thousand years,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] remaining loyal to it from the time when they received it down to the age of Solon and the tyranny of Pisistratus, who, after he had placed himself at the head of the people and done much harm to the city and driven out the best of her citizens as being partizans of oligarchy, brought an end to the rule of the people and set himself up as their master.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	I, however, do not see anything unreasonable in this. I grant that if I were alone in relying on traditions regarding what happened long ago or upon records which have been handed down to us from those times I should with good reason be open to attack. But in fact many men—and men of discernment, too—will be seen to be in the same case with me. But apart from this, were I put to the test and the proof, I could show that all men are possessed of more truth gained through hearing than through seeing and that they have knowledge of greater and nobler deeds which they have heard from others than those which they have witnessed themselves. Nevertheless it is wise for a speaker neither to ignore such false assumptions—for they might perhaps confuse the truth were no one to gainsay them—nor again to spend too much time refuting them, but only enough to indicate to the rest of the audience the arguments by which they might prove that the critics speak beside the mark, and then to go back and proceed with the speech from the point where he left off. And this is what I shall do.

	I have now sufficiently discussed the form of the polity as it was in those days and the length of time during which our people continued to enjoy it. But it remains for me to recount the actions which have resulted from the excellence of their government. For from these it will be possible to see still more clearly that our ancestors not only had a better and sounder polity than the rest of the world but also employed the kind of leaders and advisers which men of intelligence ought to select. Yet I must not go on speaking even on this point, without first prefacing it with a word of explanation. For if, disdaining to take

	notice of the criticisms of people who are able to do nothing but find fault, I were to review one after the other not only the other achievements of our ancestors but also the ways and practices in warfare by which they prevailed over the barbarians and attained to glory among the Hellenes, inevitably some will say that I am really speaking of the ordinances which Lycurgus laid down and the Spartans follow.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I acknowledge that I am going to speak at length of the institutions of Sparta, not taking the view, however, that Lycurgus invented or conceived any of them, but that he imitated as well as he could the government of our ancestors,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] establishing among the Spartans a democracy tempered with aristocracy—even such as existed in Athens—, enacting that the offices, be filled, not by lot, but by election, ordaining that the election of the Elders, who were to supervise all public affairs, should be conducted with the very same care as, they say, our ancestors also exercised with regard to those who were to have seats in the Areopagus, and, furthermore, conferring upon the Elders[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] the very same power which he knew that the Council of the Areopagus also had in Athens.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now that the institutions of Sparta were established after the manner of our own as they were in ancient times may be learned from many sources by those who desire to know the truth. But that skill in warfare is something which the Spartans did not practise earlier than our ancestors or employ to better advantage than they I think I can show so clearly from the struggles and the wars which are

	acknowledged to have taken place in those days that none will be able to contradict what I say—neither those who are blind worshippers of Sparta nor those who at once admire and envy and strive to imitate the ways of Athens.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I am going to begin what I shall say on this topic with a statement which will perhaps be unpleasant for some to hear, although it will not be without profit to have it said. For if anyone were to assert that Athens and Sparta had been the causes both of the greatest benefits and, after the expedition of Xerxes, of the greatest injuries to the Hellenes, without doubt he would be thought by those who know anything about the history of those times to speak the truth. For they contended with the utmost possible bravery against the power of that King, but, having done this, although they ought then to have adopted sound measures also for the tasks which followed upon that achievement, they fell into such a degree, not of folly, but of madness, that they made peace with the man who had led an army against them and who had purposed to annihilate both these cities utterly and to enslave the rest of the Hellenes—with such a man, I repeat, although they could easily have conquered him on both land and sea, they drew up a peace[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] for all time, as though he had been their benefactor, whereas, having grown jealous of each other’s merits and fallen into mutual warfare and rivalry, they did not cease attempting to destroy each other and the rest of the Hellenes until they had placed their common enemy in a position to reduce Athens, through the power of the Lacedaemonians, and again Sparta, through the power of Athens, to a state of the utmost peril.

	although they were so far outstripped in shrewdness by the barbarian, they then experienced no such resentment as the things which they suffered should have provoked nor such as it behoved them to feel; nor at the present time are the greatest of the states of Hellas ashamed to vie with each other in fawning upon the wealth of the King; nay, Argos and Thebes joined forces with him in the conquest of Egypt[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in order that he might be possessed of the greatest possible power to plot against the Hellenes, while we and the Spartans, although allied together, feel more hostile to each other than to those with whom we are each openly at war. And of this we have a not insignificant proof. For in common we deliberate about nothing whatsoever, but independently we each send ambassadors to the King, expecting that the one of these two states to which he inclines in friendship will be invested with the place of advantage among the Hellenes,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] little realizing that those who court his favour he is wont to treat insolently while with those who oppose themselves to him and hold his power in contempt he endeavours by every means to come to terms.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	I have gone into these matters, not without realizing that some will dare to say that I have here used an argument which lies beyond the scope of my subject. I, however, hold that never has an argument been advanced more pertinent than this to the foregoing discussion, neither is there any by which one can show more clearly that our ancestors were wiser in dealing with the greatest questions than were those who governed our city and the city of the Spartans after the war against Xerxes. For it will be seen that these states in the times following that war made

	peace with the barbarians, that they were bent on destroying each other and the other Hellenic states, that at the present time they think themselves worthy to rule over the Hellenes, albeit they are sending ambassadors to the King, courting his friendship and alliance: whereas those who governed Athens before that time did nothing of the sort, but entirely the opposite; for they were as firmly resolved to keep their hands off the states of Hellas as were the devout to abstain from the treasures stored up in the temples of the gods, conceiving that, second only to the war which we carry on in alliance with all mankind against the savagery of the beasts, that war is the most necessary and the most righteous which we wage in alliance with the Hellenes against the barbarians, who are by nature our foes and are eternally plotting against us.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The principle is not of my invention but is deduced from the conduct of our ancestors. For when they saw that the other states were beset by many misfortunes and wars and seditions, while their own city alone was well governed, they did not take the view that those who were wiser and more fortunate than the rest of the world were justified in caring nothing about the others or in permitting those states which shared the same stock[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] with them to be destroyed, but rather that they were bound to take thought and adopt measures to deliver them all from their present misfortunes. Having determined upon this, they endeavoured in the case of the less afflicted states to compose their quarrels by means of embassies and persuasion, but to the states which were more severely rent by factions they dispatched the most highly reputed of their citizens, who advised

	them regarding their present difficulties, and, associating themselves with the people who were unable to gain a livelihood in their own states or who had fallen below the requirements of the laws—a class which is generally destructive to ordered states[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—, they urged these to take the field with them and to seek to improve the conditions of their present life; and when there proved to be many who were inclined and persuaded to take this course, they organized them into an army, conquered the peoples who occupied the islands of the barbarians and who dwelt along the coast of either continent, expelled them all, and settled in their stead those of the Hellenes who stood in greatest need of the necessities of life. And they continued doing this and setting this example to others until they learned that the Spartans, as I have related, had subjected to their power all the cities which are situated in the Peloponnesus.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] After this they were compelled to centre their thoughts upon their own interests.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	What, then, is the good which has resulted from the war which we waged and the trouble which we took in the colonization of the Hellenes? For this is, I think, a question which the majority would very much like to have answered. Well, the result was that the Hellenes found it easier to obtain subsistence and enjoyed a greater degree of concord after they had been relieved of so great a number of the class of people which I have described; that the barbarians were driven forth from their own territory and humbled in their pride; and that those who had brought these conditions to pass gained the fame and the name of having made Hellas twice as strong as she was of old.

	I could not, then, point out a greater service than this, rendered by our ancestors, nor one more generally beneficial to the Hellenes. But I shall, perhaps, be able to show one more particularly related to their conduct of war, and, at the same time, no less admirable and more manifest to all. For who does not himself know or has not heard from the tragic poets[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] at the Dionysia of the misfortunes which befel Adrastus[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] at Thebes, how in his desire to restore to power the son of Oedipus, his own son-in-law, he lost a great number of his Argive soldiers in the battle and saw all of his captains slain, though saving his own life in dishonour, and, when he failed to obtain a truce and was unable to recover the bodies of his dead for burial, he came as a suppliant to Athens, while Theseus still ruled the city, and implored the Athenians not to suffer such men to be deprived of sepulture nor to allow ancient custom and immemorial law to be set at naught—that ordinance which all men respect without fail, not as having been instituted by our human nature, but as having been enjoined by the divine power?[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] When our people heard this plea, they let no time go by but at once dispatched ambassadors to Thebes to advise her people that they be more reverent in their deliberations regarding the recovery of the dead and that they render a decision which would be more lawful than that which they had previously made, and to hint to them also that the Athenians would not countenance their transgression of the common law of all Hellas. Having heard this message, those who were then in authority at Thebes came to a decision which was in harmony neither with the opinion which some people have of them nor with their previous resolution; on

	And let no one suppose that I fail to realize that I am giving a different version of these same events from that which I shall be found to have written in the [c dimgray]Panegyricus.[/c] But I do not think that anyone of those who can grasp the meaning of these events is so obsessed by stupidity and envy as not to commend me and consider me discreet for the manner in which I have treated them then and now.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] On this topic, then, I know that I have written wisely and expediently. But how pre-eminent our city stood in war at that time—for it was with the desire to show this that I discussed what happened at Thebes—is, I consider, clearly revealed to all by the circumstances which compelled the king of the Argives to become a suppliant of Athens and which so disposed the authorities at Thebes towards us that they chose of their own accord to accommodate themselves to the words dispatched to them by Athens more than to the laws ordained by the divine power. For our city would not have been in a position to settle properly any of those questions had she not stood far above the others both in reputation and in power.

	Although I have many noble things to tell of in the conduct of our ancestors, I am debating in my mind in what manner to present them.

	A moment ago I was undecided whether I should first review the wars and battles of the Spartans or our own. Now, however, I elect to speak first of the perils and the battles of the Spartans, in order that I may close the discussion of this subject with struggles more honourable and more righteous. When, then, the Dorians who invaded the Peloponnesus divided into three parts both the cities and the lands which they had taken from their rightful owners, those of them who received Argos and Messene as their portions ordered their affairs very much as did the Hellenes in general. But the third division of them, whom we now call Lacedaemonians, were, according to close students of their history, more embroiled in factional strife than any other people of Hellas. Moreover, the party which looked down upon the multitude, having got the upper hand, did in no wise adopt the same measures regarding the issues of that conflict as the other Hellenes who had gone through a similar experience. For the latter suffered the opposing party to live with them and share in all the privileges of the state, excepting the offices and the honours, whereas the intelligent class among the Spartans held that such men were foolish in thinking that they could live in the same city with those against whom they had committed the greatest wrongs and yet govern the state in security; they themselves did nothing of the sort, but instead set up amongst their own class the only kind of equality and

And having done this, they disposed of the land, of which by right every man should have had an equal share, seizing for themselves—the few—not only the richest but more than any of the Hellenes possess, while to the mass of the people they apportioned only enough of the poorest land so that by working laboriously they could hardly gain their daily bread. Then they divided the multitude into the smallest groups possible and settled them upon many small tracts—groups who in name were spoken of as dwelling in cities, but in reality had less power than the townships with us. And, having despoiled them of all the rights which free men ought to share, they imposed upon them the greatest part in all dangers. For in the campaigns which were conducted by their kings they not only ranged them man for man side by side with themselves, but some they stationed in the first line, and whenever need arose to dispatch a relief-force anywhere and they themselves were afraid of the hardships or the dangers or the length of time involved, they sent them forth to take the brunt of the danger from all the rest.

These, like the Helots, were probably made up mainly of earlier inhabitants conquered by the Spartans. See Gilbert, [c dimgray]Greek Constitutional Antiquities[/c] pp. 30 ff. Isocrates’ picture of the driving out of the Perioeci from participation in the Spartan state as the result of a bitter factional fight seems to rest on a very doubtful tradition.

	make a long story by detailing all the outrages which were visited upon the common people? Why not, rather, mention the greatest of their misfortunes and refuse to be burdened with the rest? For over these people, who have from the beginning suffered evils so dreadful, but in present emergencies are found so useful, the Ephors have the power to put to death without trial as many as they please,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] whereas in the other states of Hellas it is a crime against the gods to stain one’s hands with the blood of even the basest of slaves.

	But the reason I have at some length gone into their domestic policy and the wrongs which they have committed against the common people is, that I may ask those who applaud all the actions of the Spartans whether they applaud these also and whether they look upon those struggles as righteous and honourable which have been carried on against these men. For I, for my part, regard them as having been great and terrible and the source of many injuries to the defeated and of many gains to the victors—gains for whose sake they are at all times continually waging war—but not, no, not as righteous or even as honourable or becoming to men who lay claim to excellence. I speak, not of excellence as that word is used in the arts or in many other activities, but of the excellence which in the hearts of good men and true is engendered in company with righteousness and justice. And it is this kind of excellence which is the subject of my whole discourse. But depreciating this, some men heap praise upon those who have committed more crimes than all others and are not aware that they are betraying their own thoughts

	and showing that they would praise also men who, already possessing more wealth than they need, would not scruple to slay their own brothers and friends and associates so as to obtain their possessions also. For such crimes are parallel to the things which the Spartans have done. And those who applaud the latter cannot escape taking the same view also of the crimes which I have just mentioned.

	I marvel that there are none who regard battles and victories won contrary to justice as more disgraceful and fraught with greater reproaches than defeats which are met without dishonour—and that too, knowing that great, but evil, powers prove often stronger than good men who choose to risk their lives for their country. For such men are much more deserving of our praise than those who, while ready and willing to face death to gain the possessions of others, are yet in no wise different from hireling soldiers. For these are the acts of men depraved, and if men of honest purpose sometimes come off worse in the struggle than men who desire to do injustice, we may attribute this to negligence of the gods. But I might apply this point also to the misfortune which befel the Spartans at Thermopylae, which all who have heard of it praise and admire more than the battles and victories which have been won over adversaries against whom wars ought never to have been waged,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] albeit some are without scruple in extolling such successes, not realizing that nothing is either righteous or honourable which is not said or done with justice.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	But the Spartans have never given a thought to this truth; for they look to no other object than that of securing for themselves as many of the possessions of other peoples as they can. Our ancestors, on the other hand, have shown concern for nothing in the world so much as for a good name among the Hellenes; for they considered that there could be no truer or fairer judgement than that which is rendered by a whole race of people. And they have been manifestly of this mind both in their government of the state in other respects and in the conduct of the greatest affairs. For in the three wars,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] apart from the Trojan war, which were fought by the Hellenes against the barbarians—in all these they placed our city in the forefront of the fighting. Of these wars, one was the struggle against Xerxes,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] in which they were as much superior to the Lacedaemonians in every crisis as were the latter to the rest of the Hellenes. Another was the war connected with the founding of the colonies,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] in which none of the Dorians came to help them, but in which Athens, having been made the leader of those who were lacking in the means of subsistence and of all others who desired to join with her, so completely reversed the state of affairs that, whereas the barbarians had been wont in times past to seize and hold the greatest cities of Hellas, she placed the Hellenes in a position where they were able to do what they had formerly suffered.

In those days there occurred at the same time very many wars and very great perils. I could neither ascertain nor set forth the history of all of them, and I shall pass over the great bulk of the things which were then done, but do not now press upon us to be told, and shall endeavour to inform you as briefly as I can of the enemies who attacked our city, of the battles which deserve to be recalled and recounted, of their leaders, and, furthermore, of the pretexts which they alleged, and of the strength of the peoples who joined in their campaigns.

However, he met with the fate which was his due. For so far did he fail of getting

On the contrary, they escaped all such aberrations and remained steadfast in the character which they had because of the excellence of their government, taking more pride in their state of soul and in the quality of their minds than in the battles which had been fought, and being more admired by the rest of the world because of this self-control and moderation than because of the bravery displayed in their perils.

	Now I observe that the other orators close their discourses with the greatest and most memorable deeds, but, while I commend the wisdom of those who hold and practise this principle, yet I am not in a position to do this same thing, but am compelled to go on with my discourse. The reason why, I shall explain presently, after first saying just a word.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After I had written out my discourse as far as what has been read, I was revising it with three or four youths who are wont to spend their time in my society. And when, on going over what I had written, it seemed to us to be good and to require only an ending, it occurred to me to send for one of those who had studied with me[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but had lived under an oligarchy and had elected to extol the Lacedaemonians. I did this in order that, if any false statement had escaped me, he might detect it and point it out to me. He came, upon being summoned, and, having read through my discourse (for why take up time in relating what happened in the interval?), he took no offence at anything which I had written but, on the contrary, praised the speech in the highest possible terms and expressed views on each part of it which were very similar to those which I held. And yet it was manifest that he was not pleased with what I had said about the Lacedaemonians. And he showed it forthwith; for he made

	bold to say that if the Spartans had done no other service to the Hellenes, at any rate, they deserved the gratitude of all men because they had discovered the best ways of life and not only followed these ways themselves but had taught them to the rest of the world.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This assertion, so brief and so brusque, furnished the reason why I did not close my speech at the point where I was inclined to end it. I thought that it would be shameful and reprehensible on my part to permit one who had been my pupil to make in my presence a statement which was unsound. With this in mind, I asked him whether he had no regard for his present auditors and was not ashamed of having said things which were impious and false and full of many contradictions. “You will realize,” I said, “that your assertion is such as I have declared it to be if you will ask any intelligent men, first what they think are the best ways of life, and next how long a time has passed since the Lacedaemonians settled in the Peloponnesus. For there is no one who, among the ways of life, will not give preference to the practice of reverence in relation to the gods and of justice in relation to mankind and of wisdom in relation to all activities in general, and they will tell you that the Spartans have lived in the Peloponnesus not more than seven hundred years. These things being so, if you speak the truth when you assert that they were the discoverers of the best ways of life, then it must follow that those who lived many generations before the Spartans settled there had no part in them—neither those who made the expedition against Troy nor those who were of the generation of Heracles and Theseus or of Minos, son

	of Zeus, or Rhadamanthus or Aeacus[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] or any of the others who are celebrated in song for the virtues which I have mentioned, but that all of them have in this respect a reputation which is false. But if, on the other hand, you are speaking nonsense, and if it is fitting that men who were descended from gods should have cultivated these virtues more than all others and transmitted them to their successors as well, then you cannot escape being thought mad by all who hear you for being so reckless and unjust and undiscriminating in your praise. Furthermore, if you were praising them without having heard any of my speech, you would no less be speaking drivel, but you would not be manifestly contradicting yourself. But now, since you have commended my discourse, which proves that the Lacedaemonians have committed many outrages both against their own kinsmen and the rest of the Hellenes, how could you then say that those who are open to these charges have been the leaders in the best ways of life?

	“Moreover, this consideration also has escaped you, that the things which have been overlooked, whether in ways of living or in the arts or in all other activities, are not discovered by any and every one, but by men who have superior endowments and are both able to learn the most of what has been discovered before their time and willing more than all others to give their minds to the search for what is new. But in these respects the Lacedaemonians are more backward than the barbarians.

In this practice, those who are caught are punished with fines and blows, while those who have accomplished the greatest number of thefts and have been able to escape detection enjoy a higher esteem among their fellow-youths than the others, and when they attain to manhood, provided they remain true to the ways which they practised in youth, they are in line for the most important offices.

	“If anyone can point out an education which is more cherished by them or by which they set greater store than this, I am willing to grant that there is not a word of truth in what I have said about anything whatsoever. And yet what is there in such conduct that is good or admirable and not, on the contrary, shameful? How can we fail to condemn the folly of those who extol men who have so far departed from our common laws and are in no respect of the same way of thinking as either the Hellenes or the barbarians? For the rest of the world looks upon malefactors and thieves as more depraved than slaves, whereas the Lacedaemonians regard those who stand first in such crimes as the best among their youths and honour them the most. And yet who that is in his right mind would not prefer to die many times rather than be known as seeking through such practices to school himself in virtue?”

	When he heard this, he did not answer arrogantly any of the things which I had said, neither, on the other hand, was he altogether silent, but remarked as follows: “You”—meaning myself—“have spoken as if I applauded all of the ways of Sparta and considered them good. But in fact I think that you are right in condemning the Spartans for the licence practised by their youth and for many other things as well, but wrong in attacking me. For I was troubled on reading your speech by what you had said about the Lacedaemonians, but much more by my own inability to utter a single word in their defence against what you had written, accustomed as I had been at all other times to commend you.

	I could, namely, that for this reason at least, if for no other, they deserved the gratitude of all of us, because they followed the best ways of life. However, I said this, not with any thought of reverence or justice or wisdom—the virtues which you mentioned[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—but having in mind the athletic practices which have been instituted among them, their training in courage, their spirit of concord, and, in a word, their discipline for war. These all men will commend, and will concede that the Spartans practise them most of all.”

	When he had said this, I accepted his explanation, feeling that it did not break down any of the criticisms which I had made but that it covered up, not without tact, nay, with good taste, the crudeness of his previous utterance, and that his defence on the other points showed greater moderation than his former brusque assertion. Nevertheless, though I dismissed that matter, I stated that with reference to these very claims which he made for the Spartans I had an attack which was much more damaging than what I had said on the subject of stealing among their youths. “For by that practice,” I said, “they ruined their own youths, and by these which you have just mentioned, they seek to destroy the Hellenes. And it is easy to see at a glance that this is so; for I think that all men will agree that those men are the basest and deserve the severest punishment who take the discoveries which have been made for our benefit and use them for the injury, not of the barbarians nor of those who wrong them nor of those who invade their territory, but of those who are their nearest kin and share the same blood with them.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] And this is

	what the Spartans have done. And yet with what conscience can we say that they make good use of their warlike practices who have at all times without ceasing sought to destroy those whom it behoved them to save?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“In truth, however, it is not you alone who fail to distinguish those who make good use of things, but, I might almost say, the great majority of the Hellenes. For whenever they see or hear from others that any people devote themselves zealously to what appear to be good practices, they extol them and make many speeches about them, without knowing what will be the effects of this devotion. However, those who desire to form a correct judgement about such people should remain silent and have no opinion about them in the beginning, but when the time comes when they can observe them both speaking and taking action regarding both private and public affairs, then they should take accurate note of what they do in each case; and when men make good use of the things which they have practised, they should praise and honour them, but when they go wrong and do evil they should censure and abhor them and guard themselves against their ways, bearing in mind that things do not of their own nature either help or harm us, but that the manner in which they are used and employed by men is the cause of all the things which befall us.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] One may grasp the truth of this from the following consideration: things which are in themselves always the same and never different are to some helpful and to others harmful. And yet it is not conceivable that each thing should have a nature which itself is contrary to itself and not the same. But, on the other hand, who that can reason correctly will not look upon

	it as natural that the consequences should be by no means the same in the case of those who act rightly and justly and in the case of those who act wilfully and wickedly?

	“This same argument applies also to the matter of concord; for this is not different in its nature from the things which I have discussed; on the contrary, we shall find that it is in some instances the cause of very many blessings, but in others of the greatest evils and misfortunes. And I contend that the concord of the Spartans is of the latter sort. For I shall speak the truth even at the risk of appearing to some to say what is quite contrary to the general opinion. For by being of one mind amongst themselves regarding the outside world they have always striven to set the Hellenes at variance with each other, reducing this practice, as it were, to a fine art; and they have always looked upon the cruellest of evils which befel the other states as of all things in the world the greatest of boons to themselves; for when the states were in such stress, they found it possible to manage them as they pleased. So that no one could justly praise them because of their concord, any more than one could praise pirates or brigands or men given to other forms of injustice. For such men also enjoy concord among themselves[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and thereby seek to destroy all others. But if I appear to some to use a comparison which is not in keeping with the reputation of the Spartans, I discard this and instance the Triballians,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] who, according to what all men say, are of one mind as are no other people on earth, but are bent on destroying not only those who border upon their territory and those who live in their neighbourhood but also all others whom they are able to reach.

	But men who pretend to excellence must not imitate their example but much rather the power of wisdom and of justice and of the other virtues. For these do not work for the benefit of their own natures,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but whomsoever they visit and abide with—these they bless with prosperity and happiness. But the Lacedaemonians do the very opposite: whomsoever they approach they seek to destroy and they are ever striving to appropriate all the good things which belong to the world at large.”

	Having said these things, I silenced the man to whom I had addressed my remarks, albeit he was able and experienced in many things and had been trained in speaking no less than any of those who had been under my instruction. However, the youths who had been present at all this discussion did not form the same judgement as myself, but, while they applauded me both for having spoken more vigorously than they anticipated and for having debated well, they disparaged my opponent, although in fact they judged neither of us correctly but missed the truth as to us both. For he went his way, having grown wiser and feeling chastened in spirit, as is becoming to men of intelligence; he had experienced the force of the inscription at Delphi and come to know both himself and the nature of the Lacedaemonians better than before. I, on the other hand, remained, having perhaps debated effectively, but having because of this very fact shown less understanding, cherishing a greater pride than befits men of my age, and given over to youthful confusion.

	I did not cease until I had dictated to my boy[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] the speech which a short time before I had delivered with pleasure but which a little later was to cause me distress. For when, after three or four days had elapsed, I was reading and going over it, I found that, while I was not troubled about the things which I had said about Athens (for in everything which had reference to her I had written well and justly), yet I was distressed and uncomfortable about what I had said with reference to the Lacedaemonians. For it seemed to me that I had not spoken of them with moderation nor in the same manner as the rest of the world but with contempt and with extreme bitterness and altogether without understanding. The result was that I was often on the point of blotting out or burning what I had written and as often changed my mind when I thought with pity of my old age and of the labour which had been spent upon my discourse.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Since I was in this state of confusion, shifting frequently from one impulse to the other, I decided that the best thing for me to do was to call in those of my former disciples who lived in the city and take counsel with them as to whether my discourse was to be entirely destroyed or to be distributed among those who desired to have it, and to follow their judgement whatever it might be. Having so resolved, I lost no time; they whom I have mentioned were summoned at once; I announced to them beforehand the object of their coming together; the speech was read aloud, was praised and applauded and accorded even such a reception as is given to successful declamations.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	presumably about the discourse which had been read. But the man whom I had sent for at first to obtain his advice (the panegyrist of the Lacedaemonians, to whom I had spoken at greater length than I should), having remained silent in the meantime, turned to me and said that he was in doubt what to do in the present situation, for he desired neither to discredit the words which I had spoken nor was he able to credit them entirely. “For I wonder,” he continued, “whether you were as distressed and uncomfortable about the things which you had said concerning the Lacedaemonians as you allege—for I see nothing in what you have written to indicate such a feeling—and whether you really brought us together because you desired to get our advice about your discourse, since you knew well enough that we always commend whatever you say or do. Men of intelligence are accustomed to take common counsel with others regarding matters about which they are concerned, preferably with those who are wiser than themselves, but, at any rate, with those who will express their own judgement. But you have done the very opposite. Therefore I accept neither of these explanations but am rather of the opinion that you summoned us here and pronounced your encomium on Athens, not ingenuously nor for the reason you stated to us, but because you wanted to test us to see if we were true to the cultivated life, if we remembered what had been said to us under your tutelage, and if we could grasp at once the manner in which your speech was written—that you chose, and chose wisely, to eulogize your own city in order that you might gratify the multitude of your fellow-citizens and that you might win the acclaim of those who are friendly disposed

	towards you. But having so decided, you conceived that if you confined your discourse to Athens alone and repeated the fables about her which fall easily from the lips of everyone, your speech would appear no different from those which had been composed by the other orators (which would cause you extreme humiliation and distress), whereas if you discarded these fables and dealt with her acknowledged achievements, which have brought many blessings to the Hellenes, and compared these with the deeds of the Lacedaemonians, praising the achievements of your ancestors and censuring the things which have been done by the Lacedaemonians, not only would your discourse make a more striking impression upon your hearers but you yourself would lose no ground, and many would admire such a treatment of the theme more than what had been written by the other orators.

Pondering this difficulty, you proceeded to study in what light you could represent each of these two cities in order that you might seem to speak the truth about them both and that you might be able to praise your ancestors, just as you purposed to do, and at the same time to appear to be censuring the Spartans in the eyes of those who have no liking for

	them, while in reality doing nothing of the sort but covertly praising them instead. Seeking such an effect, you found without difficulty arguments of double meaning, which lend themselves no more to the purpose of those who praise than of those who blame, but are capable of being turned both ways and leave room for much disputation—arguments the employment of which, when one contends in court over contracts for his own advantage, is shameful and no slight token of depravity but, when one discourses on the nature of man and of things, is honourable and bespeaks a cultivated mind.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Even such is the discourse which has been read, in which you have represented your ancestors as devoted to peace and lovers of the Hellenes and champions of equality in the government of states, but have painted the Spartans as arrogant and warlike and self-seeking, as indeed they have been conceived by all men to be.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“Such being the nature of each of these two cities, the Athenians are extolled by all men and are credited with being friendly to the masses, while the Spartans are envied and disliked by the majority of men. There are, however, those who praise them and admire them and make bold to say that they have greater advantages than were possessed by your ancestors. For arrogance partakes of dignity—a quality held in high esteem—and men of that character are regarded as more high-minded than those who champion equality, just as those who are warlike are regarded as superior to those who are peaceable. For the latter are neither seekers after what they do not have nor staunch guardians of what they possess, while the former are effective in both respects—both in seizing whatever they covet and in keeping whatever

	they have once made their own. And this is what is done by those who are men in the complete sense.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But the eulogists of Sparta think they have even a stronger plea for self-seeking than what I have said. For they do not consider that men who break contracts and cheat and falsify accounts deserve to be termed self-seeking; for because they are in bad repute with all men they come off worse in all circumstances, whereas the self-seeking of the Spartans and of kings and despots is a gift from heaven which all men crave. It is true that those who hold such power are the objects of abuse and execration; but no man is so constituted by nature that he would not pray to the gods to be granted this power, preferably for himself, but, failing that, for those nearest and dearest to him. And this fact makes it manifest that all men regard it as the greatest good in the world to have the advantage over others.

	all like any other, but which to those who read it casually will appear to be ingenuous and easy to comprehend, though to those who scan it thoroughly and endeavour to see in it what has escaped all others it will reveal itself as difficult and hard to understand, packed with history and philosophy, and filled with all manner of devices and fictions—not the kind of fictions which, used with evil intent, are wont to injure one’s fellow-citizens, but the kind which, used by the cultivated mind, are able to benefit or to delight one’s audience,—you will object, I say, that, whereas you have chosen to do this, yet I have not allowed any of this to stand as you resolved that it should, but that I fail to see that in seeking both to explain the force of your words and to expound your real thoughts I thereby lessen the reputation of the discourse in proportion as I make it more patent and intelligible to its readers; for by implanting understanding in those who are without knowledge I render the discourse naked and strip it of the honour which would otherwise attach to it through those who study hard and are willing to take pains.

	“But, while I acknowledge that my own intelligence is vastly inferior to your own, yet as surely as I appreciate this fact so surely do I know that in times when your city deliberates on matters of the greatest import those who are reputed to be the wisest sometimes miss the expedient course of action, whereas now and then some chance person from the ranks of men who are deemed of no account and are regarded with contempt hits upon the right course and is thought to give the best advice.

As it is, I think that while most of the Lacedaemonians will continue to abide in the ways to which they have been faithful in past times and will pay no more attention to what is written in Athens than to what is said beyond the Pillars of Heracles, yet the most intelligent among them, who possess and admire certain of your writings, will not misapprehend anything of what is said in this discourse if they can find someone who will interpret it to them, and if they can take the time to ponder over it by themselves; on the contrary, they will appreciate the praise given to their own city, which is based on proof, while they will dismiss with contempt the abuse, which is uttered at random with no regard to the facts, and is offensive only in the words employed; and they will think that envy slipped in the calumnies which are found in your treatise, but that you have recorded the exploits and the battles in which they themselves take great pride and because of which they enjoy a high repute with the

	rest of the world, and that you have made these achievements memorable by collecting them all and placing them side by side with each other and so have brought it about that many of the Spartans long to read and peruse your accounts of them, not because they crave to hear of their own deeds, but because they wish to hear how you have dealt with them. And as they think and dwell upon these deeds, they will not fail to recall also those ancient exploits through which you have glorified their ancestors,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but will often talk of them amongst themselves; and first of all they will tell of the time when, being still Dorians, they saw their own cities to be inglorious and insignificant and in need of many things, and, feeling them to be unworthy, took the field against the leading states of the Peloponnesus—against Argos and Lacedaemon and Messene—conquered them in battle and drove the vanquished both from their cities and from their lands, and seized for themselves at that time all the possessions of the enemy and have continued to hold them to this day. And no man can point to a greater or a more marvellous achievement in those times nor to an enterprise more fortunate or more blessed of the gods than that which delivered those who engaged in it from their own poverty and placed them in possession of the prosperity of others.

	thousand men[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] they considered themselves unworthy to live unless they could make themselves masters of all the cities in the Peloponnesus. In this state of mind, they undertook to wage war and did not cease, albeit they were involved in many misadventures and dangers, before they had reduced them all to subjection, except the city of the Argives. But when at length they held the greatest territory and the strongest power in Hellas and a reputation appropriate to men who had achieved such mighty things, they continued no less to pride themselves upon the fact that they could boast of a record unique and glorious: for they, alone of the Hellenes, could say that, albeit so few in number, they had never followed the lead or done the bidding of any one of the populous states, but had throughout been free and independent; and that they themselves in the war against the barbarians had held the place of leadership among all the Hellenes and had attained this honour, not without good reason, but because they had fought more battles than any other people in those times and had never been defeated in any one of them, when a king led them forth to battle, but had been victorious in all. And no one could urge a stronger proof than this of their valour and their hardihood and of their concord amongst themselves, except that which I shall now mention: for of all the other Hellenic states, many as they are, no man could cite or find a single one which has not been involved in the misadventures which are wont to happen to states, whereas in the city of the Spartans no one can

But I do wish to relate my personal experiences in relation to its composition. I entered upon it at the age which I have already stated at the beginning.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] But when I had written half of it, I was attacked by a malady which it is not decorous to name,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] but which is powerful enough to carry off in the course of three or four days not only older people but many in the prime of life. I battled against this disease without respite for three years, and I passed every day of that time with such devotion to my work that those who knew of my industry as well as those who learned of it from them admired me more because of this fortitude than because of the things for which I had formerly been praised. When, however, I had at length given up my work both because of my illness and of my age, certain of those who were in the habit of paying me visits, and who had read again and again the portion of my discourse which I had written, begged and urged me not to leave it half-finished or incomplete, but to work upon it for a short time and to give my thoughts to what remained to be done. They did not speak as men do who perfunctorily acquit themselves of a duty, but praised extravagantly what I had written, saying about it such things that if any

But, although I had this feeling about the things which they made bold to state, I did allow myself to be persuaded (for why make a long story of it?) to occupy myself with the completion of the discourse, at a time when I lacked but three years of having lived a century and when I was in a state of infirmity such that anyone else similarly afflicted, so far from undertaking to write a discourse of his own, would not even be willing to listen to one worked out and submitted by another.

	[b]Evagoras[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The discourse entitled [c dimgray]Evagoras[/c] is the third of the
	“Cyprian” orations. The first of these, [c dimgray]To Nicocles[/c],[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] is addressed to the son of Evagoras, king of Cyprus, who succeeded his father on the throne, and gives the young ruler advice on how a king should conduct himself toward his subjects. The second, [c dimgray]Nicocles or The Cyprians[/c],[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] discusses the duties of a king’s subjects. The third, [c dimgray]Evagoras[/c], is an [c dimgray]encomium[/c] (rhetorical eulogy) and was composed for a festival held by Nicocles in memory of his father Evagoras, king of the Cyprian kingdom of Salamis.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The main facts of the life of Evagoras, his accession to the monarchy and his deeds as ruler, are narrated in Isocrates’ discourse although, in accordance with the rhetorical rules of this form of composition, they are embellished by the author.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Evagoras gained the throne not later than 411 b.c., and died in 374 b.c. Aristotle in the [c dimgray]Politics[/c] (1311 b) states that Evagoras was murdered, but Isocrates is silent with respect to the manner of the death of his hero.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The date of the composition is not known with exactness. No doubt it was delivered not many years

	after the death of Evagoras. Blass[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] dates it about 370 b.c.; Jebb[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] places it as late as 365 b.c. The later date is preferred by Mathieu.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Isocrates himself, at the time of writing the discourse, was advanced in years.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The [c dimgray]Evagoras[/c], like the [c dimgray]Encomium of Helen[/c] and the [c dimgray]Busiris[/c], belongs to the [c dimgray]epideictic[/c] or [c dimgray]display[/c] group of Isocratean compositions and in its style shows the influence of the rhetorician Gorgias,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] but it is unlike these discourses on mythical personages in that it is a sincere panegyric of the murdered king whom Isocrates personally knew and admired. There is, however, much exaggeration in the delineation of the character of the hero. This embellishment was always present in eulogies and was an inevitable characteristic of the rhetorical [c dimgray]funeral oration[/c] as it was developed by the Sophists. In consequence, Isocrates relates only the successes of Evagoras and omits all mention of the reverses of the king.[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c]

	When I saw you, Nicocles,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] honouring the tomb of your father, not only with numerous and beautiful offerings, but also with dances, music, and athletic contests, and, furthermore, with races of horses and triremes, and leaving to others no possibility of surpassing you[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] in such celebrations, I judged that Evagoras (if the dead have any perception of that which takes place in this world),[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] while gladly accepting these offerings and rejoicing in the spectacle of your devotion and princely magnificence in honouring him, would feel far greater gratitude to anyone who could worthily recount his principles in life and his perilous deeds than to all other men; for we shall find that men of ambition and greatness of soul not only are desirous of praise for such things, but prefer a glorious death to life, zealously seeking glory rather than existence,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] and doing all that lies in their power to leave behind a memory of themselves that shall never die.

	can effect nothing of this kind, but is an indication of wealth only; and those who devote themselves to music and letters and to the various contests, some by exhibiting their strength and others their artistic skill, win for themselves greater honour. But the spoken words which should adequately recount the deeds of Evagoras would make his virtues never to be forgotten among all mankind.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now other writers should have praised those who in their own time had proved themselves good men, to the end that those who have the ability to glorify the deeds of their contemporaries, by speaking in the presence of those who knew the facts might have employed the truth concerning them, and also that the younger generation might with greater emulation have striven for virtue, knowing well that they would be praised more highly than those whom they have excelled in merit. But as it is, who would not be disheartened when he sees those who lived in the time of the Trojan War, and even earlier,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] celebrated in song and tragedy, and yet foresees that even if he himself surpass their valorous achievements he will never be thought worthy of such praise? The cause of this is envy, which has this as its only good—it is the greatest evil to those who feel it. For some are so ungenerous by nature that they would listen more gladly to the praise of men of whose existence they are uncertain rather than of those who may have been their own benefactors. Men of intelligence, however, should not let themselves be enslaved by men whose minds are so perverted; on the contrary, they should ignore such as these and accustom their fellows to hear about those whom we are in duty bound to praise,

	especially since we are aware that progress is made, not only in the arts, but in all other activities, not through the agency of those that are satisfied with things as they are, but through those who correct, and have the courage constantly to change, anything which is not as it should be.

	I am fully aware that what I propose to do is difficult—to eulogize in prose the virtues of a man. The best proof is this: Those who devote themselves to philosophy[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] venture to speak on many subjects of every kind, but no one of them has ever attempted to compose a discourse on such a theme.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] And I can make much allowance for them. For to the poets is granted the use of many embellishments of language, since they can represent the gods as associating with men, conversing with and aiding in battle whomsoever they please, and they can treat of these subjects not only in conventional expressions, but in words now exotic, now newly coined, and now in figures of speech, neglecting none, but using every kind with which to embroider their poesy.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Orators, on the contrary, are not permitted the use of such devices; they must use with precision only words in current use and only such ideas as bear upon the actual facts. Besides, the poets compose all their works with metre and rhythm, while the orators do not share in any of these advantages; and these lend such charm that even though the poets may be deficient in style and thoughts, yet by the very spell of their rhythm and harmony

	they bewitch their listeners.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] The power of poetry may be understood from this consideration; if one should retain the words and ideas of poems which are held in high esteem, but do away with the metre, they will appear far inferior to the opinion we now have of them. Nevertheless, although poetry has advantages so great, we must not shrink from the task, but must make the effort and see if it will be possible in prose to eulogize good men in no worse fashion than their encomiasts do who employ song and verse.

	In the first place, with respect to the birth and ancestry of Evagoras,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] even if many are already familiar with the facts, I believe it is fitting that I also should recount them for the sake of the others, that all may know that he proved himself not inferior to the noblest and greatest examples of excellence which were of his inheritance. For it is acknowledged that the noblest of the demigods are the sons of Zeus, and there is no one who would not award first place among these to the Aeacidae; for while in the other families we shall find some of superior and some of inferior worth, yet all the Aeacidae have been most renowned of all their contemporaries. In the first place Aeacus,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] son of Zeus and ancestor of the family of the Teucridae, was so distinguished that when a drought visited the Greeks and many persons had perished, and when the magnitude of the calamity had passed all bounds, the leaders of the cities came as suppliants to him; for they thought that, by reason of his kinship with Zeus and his piety, they would most quickly obtain from

And they say that at his wedding alone, of all the human race who have ever lived, the wedding-song was sung by gods. To each of these two were born sons—to Telamôn Ajax and Teucer, and to Peleus Achilles, and these heroes gave proof of their valour in the clearest and most convincing way; for not alone in their own cities were they pre-eminent, or in the places where they made their homes, but when an expedition was organized by the Greeks against the barbarians,[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] and a great army was assembled on either side and no warrior of repute was absent, Achilles above all distinguished himself in these perils. And Ajax was second to him in valour, and Teucer, who proved himself worthy of their kinship and inferior to none of the other heroes, after he had helped in the capture of Troy, went to Cyprus and founded Salamis,

	So distinguished from the beginning was the heritage transmitted to Evagoras by his ancestors. After the city had been founded in this manner, the rule at first was held by Teucer’s descendants; at a later time, however, there came from Phoenicia a fugitive, who, after he had gained the confidence of the king who then reigned, and had won great power, showed no proper gratitude for the favour shown him; on the contrary, he acted basely toward his host, and being skilled at grasping, he expelled his benefactor and himself seized the throne. But distrustful of the consequences of his measures and wishing to make his position secure, he reduced the city to barbarism, and brought the whole island into subservience to the Great King.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Such was the state of affairs in Salamis, and the descendants of the usurper were in possession of the throne when Evagoras was born. I prefer to say nothing of the portents, the oracles, the visions appearing in dreams, from which the impression might be gained that he was of superhuman birth, not because I disbelieve the reports, but that I may make it clear to all that I am so far from resorting to invention in speaking of his deeds that even of those matters which are in fact true I dismiss such as are known only to the few and of which not all the citizens are cognizant. And I shall begin my account of him with the generally acknowledged facts.

Witnesses could be produced for these assertions: for his modesty—fellow-citizens who were educated with him; for his beauty—all who beheld him; for his strength—all the contests[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in which he vanquished his age-mates. When he attained to manhood not only did all these qualities grow up with him, but to them were also added manly courage, wisdom, and justice, and that too in no ordinary measure, as is the case with some others, but each of these characteristics in extraordinary degree. So surpassing was his excellence of both body and mind, that when the kings of that time looked upon him they were terrified and feared for their throne, thinking that a man of such nature could not possibly pass his life in the status of a private citizen, but whenever they observed his character, they felt such confidence in him that they believed that even if anyone else should dare to injure them, Evagoras would be their champion. And although opinions of him were so at variance, they were mistaken in neither respect; for he neither remained in private life, nor did them injury; on the contrary, the Deity took such thought for him that he should honourably assume the throne, that all the preparations which necessarily involved impiety were made by another, while he preserved for Evagoras those means whereby it was possible for him to gain the rule in accordane with piety and justice.

	of the way. But Evagoras escaped this peril, and having saved himself by fleeing to Soli in Cilicia did not show the same spirit as those who are the victims of like misfortune. For other exiles from royal power are humbled in spirit because of their misfortunes, whereas Evagoras attained to such greatness of soul that, although until that time he had lived as a private citizen, when he was driven into exile he determined to gain the throne. The wandering life of an exile, the dependence upon the help of others in seeking his restoration and the paying of court to his inferiors—all these he scorned; but this he took as his guiding principle, which those who would be god-fearing men must take—to act only in self-defence and never to be the aggressor; and he chose either by success to regain the throne or, failing in that, to die. And so, calling to his side men numbering, according to the highest estimates, about fifty, with these he prepared to effect his return from exile. And from this venture especially the character of Evagoras and his reputation among his associates may be seen; for although he was on the point of sailing with so few companions for the accomplishment of so great a design, and although all the attendant dangers were near at hand, neither did he himself lose heart, nor did any of his companions see fit to shrink from these dangers; nay, as if a god were their leader, they one and all held fast to their promises, and Evagoras, just as if either he had an army superior to that of his adversaries or foresaw the outcome, held to his opinion. This is evident from his acts; for, when he had landed on the island, he did not think it necessary to seize a strong position, make sure of his own safety, and then to wait and see

	if some of the citizens would rally to his aid; but immediately, just as he was, on that very night he broke through a little gate in the wall, and leading his followers through this opening, attacked the palace. The confusion attendant upon such occasions, the fears of his followers, the exhortations of their leader—why need I take the time to describe?[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] When the supporters of the tyrant opposed him and the citizens generally were observers (for they held their peace because they feared either the authority of the one party or the valour of the other), he did not cease from fighting, whether alone against many or with few opposing all the foe, until, having captured the palace, he had taken vengeance upon the enemy and had succoured his friends; furthermore, he restored its ancestral honours to his family[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and established himself as ruler of the city.

	I think that even if I should mention nothing more, but should discontinue my discourse at this point, from what I have said the valour of Evagoras and the greatness of his deeds would be readily manifest: nevertheless, I consider that both will be yet more clearly revealed from what remains to be said. For of all the many sovereigns since time began, none will be found to have won this honour more gloriously than Evagoras. If we were to compare the deeds of Evagoras with those of each one, such an account would perhaps be inappropriate to the occasion, and the time would not suffice for the telling. But if we select the most illustrious of these rulers and examine their exploits in the light of his, our investigation

	Who, then, would not choose the perilous deeds of Evagoras before the fortunes of those who inherited their kingdoms from their fathers? For surely there is no one so mean of spirit that he would prefer to receive that power from his ancestors than first to acquire it, as he did, and then to bequeath it to his children. Furthermore, of the returns to their thrones by princes of ancient times the most renowned are those of which the poets tell us; indeed they not only chronicle for us those which have been most glorious, but also compose new ones of their own invention. Nevertheless, no poet has told the story of any legendary prince who has faced hazards so formidable and yet regained his throne; on the contrary, most of their heroes have been represented as having regained their kingdoms by chance, others as having employed deceit and artifice to overcome their foes. Nay, of those who lived later, perhaps indeed of all, the one hero who was most admired by the greatest number was Cyrus, who deprived the Medes of their kingdom and gained it for the Persians. But while Cyrus with a Persian army conquered the Medes, a deed which many a Greek or a barbarian could easily do, Evagoras manifestly accomplished the greater part of the deeds which have been mentioned through strength of his own mind and body. Again, while it is not at all certain from the expedition of Cyrus that he would have endured the dangers of Evagoras, yet it is obvious to all from the deeds of Evagoras that the latter would have readily attempted the exploits of Cyrus. In addition, while piety and justice characterized

	every act of Evagoras, some of the successes of Cyrus were gained impiously; for the former destroyed his enemies, but Cyrus slew his mother’s father.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Consequently if any should wish to judge, not of the greatness of their successes, but of the essential merit of each, they would justly award greater praise to Evagoras than even to Cyrus. And if there is need to speak concisely, without reservation or fear of arousing ill-feeling, but with the utmost frankness, I would say that no one, whether mortal, demigod, or immortal, will be found to have obtained his throne more nobly, more splendidly, or more piously. Anyone would in the highest degree be confirmed in this belief if, distrusting completely what I have said, he were to set about examining how each gained royal power. For it will be manifest that it is through no desire whatever of grandiloquence, but because of the truth of the matter, that I have spoken thus boldly about Evagoras.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now if he had distinguished himself in unimportant ways only, he would fittingly be thought worthy also of praise of like nature; but as it is, all would admit that of all blessings whether human or divine supreme power is the greatest, the most august, and the object of greatest strife. That man, therefore, who has most gloriously acquired the most glorious of possessions, what poet or what artificer of words[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] could praise in a manner worthy of his deeds?

	Nor again, though he was a man of surpassing merit in these respects, will Evagoras be found deficient in all others, but, in the first place, although

Again, in public affairs he held to the same opinion; for, seeing that those persons who look best after realities are least worried, and that the true freedom from anxiety is to be found, not in inactivity, but in success and patient endurance, he left nothing unexamined; on the contrary, so thoroughly was he cognizant of public affairs and so thorough was his knowledge of each of the citizens, that neither those who conspired against him took him unawares, nor did the good citizens remain unknown to him, but all got their deserts: for he neither punished nor honoured them on the basis of what he heard from others, but from his own knowledge he judged them.

	the laws; and while he was in no need of advisers, yet he sought the counsel of his friends. He yielded often to his intimates, but in everything dominated his enemies; he inspired respect, not by the frownings of his brow, but by the principles of his life—in no thing was he disposed to carelessness or caprice, but observed his agreements in deed as well as word; he was proud, not of successes that were due to Fortune, but of those that came about through his own efforts; his friends he made subject to himself by his benefactions, the rest by his magnanimity he enslaved; he inspired fear, not by venting his wrath upon many, but because in character he far surpassed all others; of his pleasures he was the master and not their servant; by little labour he gained much leisure, but would not, to gain a little respite, leave great labours undone; in general, he fell in no respect short of the qualities which belong to kings, but choosing from each kind of government the best characteristic, he was democratic in his service to the people, statesmanlike in the administration of the city as a whole, an able general in his good counsel in the face of dangers, and princely in his superiority in all these qualities. That these attributes were inherent in Evagoras, and even more than these, it is easy to learn from his deeds themselves.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	Evagoras remedied all these defects and, besides, acquired much additional territory, surrounded it all with new walls and built triremes, and with other construction so increased the city that it was inferior to none of the cities of Greece. And he caused it to become so powerful that many who formerly despised it, now feared it.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] And yet it is not possible that cities should take on such increase unless there are those who govern them by such principles as Evagoras had and as I endeavoured to describe a little before. In consequence I am not afraid of appearing to exaggerate in speaking of the qualities of the man, but rather lest I greatly fall short of doing justice to his deeds. For who could do justice to a man of such natural gifts, a man who not only increased the importance of his own city, but advanced the whole region surrounding the island to a régime of mildness and moderation? Before Evagoras gained the throne the inhabitants were so hostile to strangers and fierce that they considered the best rulers to be those who treated the Greeks in the most cruel- fashion. At present, however, they have undergone so great a change that they strive with one another to see who shall be regarded as most friendly to the Greeks, and the majority of them take their wives from us and from them beget children, and they have greater pleasure in owning Greek possessions and observing Greek institutions than in their own, and more of those who occupy themselves with the liberal arts and with education in general now dwell in these regions than in the communities in which they formerly used to live. And for all these changes, no one could deny that Evagoras is responsible.

	The most convincing proof of the character and uprightness of Evagoras is this—that many of the most reputable Greeks left their own fatherlands and came to Cyprus to dwell, because they considered Evagoras’s rule less burdensome and more equitable than that of their own governments at home.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] To mention all the others by name would be too great a task: but who does not know about Conon, first among the Greeks for his very many glorious deeds, that when his own city had met with ill-fortune,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] he chose out of all the world Evagoras and came to him, believing that for himself Evagoras would provide the most secure asylum and for his country the most speedy assistance. And indeed Conon, although he had been successful in many previous ventures, in no one of them, it is believed, had he planned more wisely than in this; for the result of his visit to Cyprus was that he both conferred and received most benefits. In the first place, no sooner had Evagoras and Conon met one another than they esteemed each other more highly than those who before had been their intimate friends. Again, they not only were in complete harmony all their lives regarding all other matters, but also in matters relating to our own city they held to the same opinion. For when they beheld Athens under the domination of the Lacedaemonians and the victim of a great reversal of fortune, they were filled with grief and indignation, both acting fittingly; for Conon was a native

	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]The Athenian fleet under Conon was defeated by the Spartans at Aegospotami in 405 b.c. After this “ill-fortune” Conon, with eight triremes, took refuge with Evagoras, where he remained until 397 b.c.

	son of Athens, and Evagoras, because of his many generous benefactions, had legally been given citizenship by the Athenians.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] And while they were deliberating how they might free Athens from her misfortunes, the Lacedaemonians themselves soon furnished the opportunity; for, as rulers of the Greeks on land and sea, they became so insatiate that they attempted to ravage Asia[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] also. Conon and Evagoras seized this opportunity, and, as the generals of the Persian king were at a loss to know how to handle the situation, these two advised them to wage war against the Lacedaemonians, not upon land but upon the sea, their opinion being that if the Persians should organize an army on land and with this should gain a victory, the mainland alone would profit, whereas, if they should be victors on the sea, all Hellas would have a share in the victory. And that in fact is what happened: the generals followed this advice, a fleet was assembled, the Lacedaemonians were defeated in a naval battle[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and lost their supremacy, while the Greeks regained their freedom and our city recovered in some measure its old-time glory and became leader of the allies. And although all this was accomplished with Conon as commander, yet Evagoras both made the outcome possible and furnished the greater part of the armament. In gratitude we honoured them with the highest honours and set up their statues[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] where stands the image of Zeus the Saviour, near to it and to one another, a memorial both of the magnitude of their benefactions and of their mutual friendship.

	The king of Persia, however, did not have the same opinion of them; on the contrary, the greater and more illustrious their deeds the more he feared them. Concerning Conon I will give an account elsewhere[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; but that toward Evagoras he entertained this feeling not even the king himself sought to conceal. For he was manifestly more concerned about the war in Cyprus than about any other, and regarded Evagoras as a more powerful and formidable antagonist than Cyrus, who had disputed the throne with him.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] The most convincing proof of this statement is this: when the king heard of the preparations Cyrus was making he viewed him with such contempt that because of his indifference Cyrus almost stood at the doors of his palace before he was aware of him.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] With regard to Evagoras, however, the king had stood in terror of him for so long a time that even while he was receiving benefits from him he had undertaken to make war upon him—a wrongful act, indeed, but his purpose was not altogether unreasonable. For the king well knew that many men, both Greeks and barbarians, starting from low and insignificant beginnings, had overthrown great dynasties, and he was aware too of the lofty ambition of Evagoras and that the growth of both his prestige and of his political activities was not taking place by slow degrees; also that Evagoras had unsurpassed natural ability and that Fortune was fighting with him as an ally. Therefore it was not in anger for the events of the past, but with forebodings for the future, nor yet fearing for Cyprus alone, but for

	[m1]\ [/m]
	But nevertheless, although Evagoras was inferior in all the resources of war, after he had marshalled in opposition to these extraordinarily immense preparations of the king his own determination, he proved himself in these circumstances to be far more worthy of admiration than in all those I have mentioned before. For when his enemies permitted him to be at peace, all he possessed was his own city; but when he was forced to go to war, he proved so valiant, and had so valiant an ally in his son Pnytagoras, that he almost subdued the whole of Cyprus, ravaged Phoenicia, took Tyre by storm, caused Cilicia to revolt from the king, and slew so many of his enemies that many of the Persians, when they mourn over their sorrows, recall the valour of Evagoras.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] And finally he so glutted them with war[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] that the Persian kings, who at other times were not accustomed to make peace with their rebellious subjects until they had become masters of their persons, gladly made peace,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] abandoning this custom and leaving entirely undisturbed the authority of Evagoras. And although the king within three years[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] destroyed the dominion of the Lacedaemonians,[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] who were then at the height of their glory and power, yet after he had waged war against Evagoras for ten years,[c dimgray][sup]g[/sup][/c] he left him lord of all that he had possessed before he entered upon the war.

	thing of all is this: the city which, held by another prince, Evagoras had captured with fifty men, the Great King, with all his vast power, was unable to subdue at all.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In truth, how could one reveal the courage, the wisdom, or the virtues generally of Evagoras more clearly than by pointing to such deeds and perilous enterprises? For he will be shown to have surpassed in his exploits, not only those of other wars, but even those of the war of the heroes which is celebrated in the songs of all men. For they, in company with all Hellas, captured Troy only,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but Evagoras, although he possessed but one city, waged war against all Asia. Consequently, if the number of those who wished to praise him had equalled those who lauded the heroes at Troy, he would have gained far greater renown than they. For whom shall we find of the men of that age—if we disregard the fabulous tales and look at the truth—who has accomplished such feats or has brought about changes so great in political affairs? Evagoras, from private estate, made himself a sovereign; his entire family, which had been driven from political power, he restored again to their appropriate honours; the citizens of barbarian birth he transformed into Hellenes, cravens into warriors, and obscure individuals into men of note; and having taken over a country wholly inhospitable and utterly reduced to savagery, he made it more civilized and gentler; furthermore, when he became hostile to the king, he defended himself so gloriously that the Cyprian War has become memorable for ever; and when he was the ally of the king, he made himself so much more serviceable than the others that, in the opinion of all, the forces he contributed to the naval

	battle at Cnidus were the largest, and as the result of this battle, while the king became master of all Asia, the Lacedaemonians instead of ravaging the continent were compelled to fight for their own land, and the Greeks, in place of servitude, gained independence, and the Athenians increased in power so greatly that those who formerly were their rulers[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] came to offer them the hegemony. Consequently, if anyone should ask me what I regard as the greatest of the achievements of Evagoras, whether the careful military preparations directed against the Lacedaemonians which resulted in the aforesaid successes, or the last war, or the recovery of his throne, or his general administration of affairs, I should be at a great loss what to say in reply; for each achievement to which I happen to direct my attention seems to me the greatest and most admirable.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Therefore, I believe that, if any men of the past have by their merit become immortal, Evagoras also has earned this preferment; and my evidence for that belief is this—that the life he lived on earth has been more blessed by fortune and more favoured by the gods than theirs. For of the demigods the greater number and the most renowned were, we shall find, afflicted by the most grievous misfortunes, but Evagoras continued from the beginning to be not only the most admired, but also the most envied for his blessings. For in what respect did he lack utter felicity? Such ancestors Fortune gave to him as to no other man, unless it has been one sprung from the same stock, and so greatly in body and mind did he excel others that he was worthy to hold sway over

	not only Salamis but the whole of Asia also; and having acquired most gloriously his kingdom he continued in its possession all his life; and though a mortal by birth, he left behind a memory of himself that is immortal, and he lived just so long that he was neither unacquainted with old age, nor afflicted with the infirmities attendant upon that time of life.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] In addition to these blessings, that which seems to be the rarest and most difficult thing to win—to be blessed with many children who are at the same time good—not even this was denied him, but this also fell to his lot. And the greatest blessing was this: of his offspring he left not one who was addressed merely by a private title; on the contrary, one was called king,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] others princes, and others princesses. In view of these facts, if any of the poets have used extravagant expressions in characterizing any man of the past, asserting that he was a god among men, or a mortal divinity, all praise of that kind would be especially in harmony with the noble qualities of Evagoras.

	No doubt I have omitted much that might be said of Evagoras; for I am past my prime of life,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] in which I should have worked out this eulogy with greater finish and diligence. Nevertheless, even at my age, to the best of my ability he has not been left without his encomium.

These I prefer to statues because I know, in the first place, that honourable men pride themselves not so much on bodily beauty as they desire to be honoured for their deeds and their wisdom; in the second place, because I know that images must of necessity remain solely among those in whose cities they were set up, whereas portrayals in words may be published throughout Hellas, and having been spread abroad in the gatherings of enlightened men, are welcomed among those whose approval is more to be desired than that of all others; and finally, while no one can make the bodily nature resemble moulded statues and portraits in painting, yet for those who do not choose to be slothful, but desire to be good men, it is easy to imitate the character of their fellow-men and their thoughts and purposes—those, I mean, that are embodied in the spoken word. For these reasons especially I have undertaken to write this discourse because I believed that for you, for your children, and for all the other descendants of Evagoras, it would be by far the best incentive, if someone should assemble his achievements, give them verbal adornment, and submit them to you for your contemplation and study. For we exhort young men to the study of philosophy[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] by praising others in order that they, emulating those who are eulogized, may desire to adopt the same pursuits, but I appeal to you and yours, using as examples not aliens, but members of your own family, and I counsel you to devote your attention to this,

Although I am aware of these things, none the less I am acting, and shall continue to act, in the same fashion as spectators at the athletic games; for they do not shout encouragement to the runners who have been distanced in the race, but to those who still strive for the victory.

	It is my task, therefore, and that of your other friends, to speak and to write in such fashion as may be likely to incite you to strive eagerly after those things which even now you do in fact desire; and you it behooves not to be negligent, but as at present so in the future to pay heed to yourself and to discipline your mind that you may be worthy of your father and of all your ancestors. For though it is the duty of all to place a high value upon wisdom, yet you kings especially should do so, who have power over very many and weighty affairs. You must not be content if you chance to be already superior to your contemporaries, but you should be chagrined if, endowed as you are by nature, distantly descended from Zeus and in our own time from a man of such distinguished excellence, you shall not far surpass,

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The [c dimgray]Encomium on Helen[/c] is an epideictic, or display, composition on a theme which subsequently became extremely popular in the schools of rhetoric. Although Helen of Sparta was a woman of divine beauty and a Homeric heroine of compelling charm, yet she was condemned and execrated by the poets as the cause of countless woes to the Greeks. Thus Aeschylus characterizes her in [c dimgray]Agamemnon[/c] 689 as ἑλένας, ἑλάνδρος, ἑλέπτολις.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	A vindication of this glorious but shameless woman, whose misconduct in abandoning her husband Menelaüs to elope with Paris to Troy had caused the Trojan War, was a difficult undertaking and was a challenge to the powers of the most accomplished rhetorician. Gorgias of Sicily had attempted the task in his extant [c dimgray]Encomium on Helen[/c], a brilliant [c dimgray]tour de force[/c], but he confesses, at the end of his composition, that his composition was, after all, a παίγνιον, or “sportive essay.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In § 14 of his [c dimgray]Helen[/c], Isocrates praises an individual who has chosen Helen as his theme, but rebukes him for having composed, not a real encomium of his heroine, but a plea in defence of her conduct. This is undoubtedly a reference to the discourse of the Sicilian rhetorician Gorgias, who had been the teacher of Isocrates, since the criticism exactly applies to

	the extant discourse [c dimgray]Helen[/c] attributed to Gorgias. Jebb, [c dimgray]Attic Orators[/c] ii. p. 98, makes the strange assertion that this work does not “bear any distinctive marks of the style of Gorgias.” On the contrary, in my opinion, it fairly bristles with them. For a discussion of this matter and an English translation by Van Hook of this extraordinary discourse by Gorgias see [c dimgray]The Classical Weekly[/c], Feb. 15, 1913. The translation of certain sections of the [c dimgray]Helen[/c] of Gorgias, in which an effort has been made to reproduce in English the effect of the original Greek, is here reprinted, as it may be of interest to the reader:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The Encomium on Helen by Gorgias
	Embellishment to a city is the valour of its citizens; to a person, comeliness; to a soul, wisdom; to a deed, virtue; to discourse, truth. But the opposite to these is lack of embellishment. Now a man, woman, discourse, work, city, deed, if deserving of praise, must be honoured with praise, but if undeserving must be censured. For it is alike aberration and stultification to censure the commendable and commend the censurable.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is the duty of the same individual both to proclaim justice wholly, and to declaim against injustice holily, to confute the detractors of Helen, a woman concerning whom there has been uniform and universal praise of poets and the celebration of her name has been the commemoration of her fame. But I desire by rational calculation to free the lady’s reputation, by disclosing her detractors as prevaricators, and, by revealing the truth, to put an end to error.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	That in nature and nurture the lady was the fairest flower of men and women is not unknown, not even to the few, for her maternity was of Leda, her paternity immortal by generation, but mortal by reputation, Tyndareüs and Zeus, of whom the one was reputed in the being, the other was asserted in the affirming; the former, the greatest of humanity, the latter, the lordliest of divinity. Of such origin, she was endowed with godlike beauty, expressed not suppressed, which inspired in many men many mad moods of love, and

	[c darkmagenta][b]ISOCRATES, Discourses 10. Helen[/b][/c]
	[b]Helen[/b]
	she, one lovely person, assembled many personalities of proud ambition, of whom some possessed opulent riches, others the fair fame of ancient ancestry; others the vigour of native strength, others the power of acquired wisdom; and all came because of amorous contention and ambitious pretention.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Who he was, however, who won Helen and attained his heart’s desire, and why, and how, I will not say, since to give information to the informed conduces to confirmation, but conveys no delectation. Passing over in my present discourse the time now past, I will proceed to the beginning of my intended discussion and will predicate the causes by reason of which it was natural that Helen went to Troy. For either by the disposition of fortune and the ratification of the gods and the determination of necessity she did what she did, or by violence confounded, or by persuasion dumbfounded, or to Love surrendered. If, however, it was against her will, the culpable should not be exculpated. For it is impossible to forestall divine disposals by human proposals. It is a law of nature that the stronger is not subordinated to the weaker, but the weaker is subjugated and dominated by the stronger; the stronger is the leader, while the weaker is the entreater. Divinity surpasses humanity in might, in sight, and in all else. Therefore, if on fortune and the deity we must visit condemnation, the infamy of Helen should find no confirmation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But if by violence she was defeated and unlawfully she was treated and to her injustice was meted, clearly her violator as a terrifier was importunate, while she, translated and violated, was unfortunate. Therefore, the barbarian who verbally, legally, actually attempted the barbarous attempt, should meet with verbal accusation, legal reprobation, and actual condemnation. For Helen, who was violated, and from her fatherland separated, and from her friends segregated, should justly meet with commiseration rather than with defamation. For he was the victor and she was the victim. It is just, therefore, to sympathize with the latter and anathematize the former.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But if it was through persuasion’s reception and the soul’s deception, it is not difficult to defend the situation and forfend the accusation, thus. Persuasion is a powerful potentate, who with frailest, feeblest frame works wonders. For it can
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 56[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Helen[/b]
	put an end to fear and make vexation vanish; it can inspire exultation and increase compassion. I will show how this is so. For I must indicate this to my hearers for them to predicate. All poetry I ordain and proclaim to be composition in metre, the listeners of which are affected by passionate trepidation and compassionate perturbation and likewise tearful lamentation, since through discourse the soul suffers, as if its own, the felicity and infelicity of property and person of others.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Come, let us turn to another consideration. Inspired incantations are provocative of charm and revocative of harm. For the power of song in association with the belief of the soul captures and enraptures and translates the soul with witchery. For there have been discovered arts twain of witchery and sorcery, which are consternation to the heart and perturbation to art.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now, it has been shown that, if Helen was won over by persuasion, she is deserving of commiseration, and not condemnation. The fourth accusation I shall now proceed to answer with a fourth refutation. For if love was the doer of all these deeds, with no difficulty will she be acquitted of the crime attributed to her. The nature of that which we see is not that which we wish it to be, but as it chances to be. For through the vision the soul is also in various ways smitten.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If, then, the eye of Helen, charmed by Alexander’s beauty, gave to her soul excitement and amorous incitement, what wonder? How could one who was weaker, repel and expel him who, being divine, had power divine? If it was physical diversion and psychical perversion, we should not execrate it as reprehensible, but deprecate it as indefensible. For it came to whom it came by fortuitous insinuations, not by judicious resolutions; by erotic compulsions, not by despotic machinations.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	How, then, is it fair to blame Helen who, whether by love captivated, or by word persuaded, or by violence dominated, or by divine necessity subjugated, did what she did, and is completely absolved from blame?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	By this discourse I have freed a woman from evil reputation; I have kept the promise which I made in the beginning; I have essayed to dispose of the injustice of defamation and the folly of allegation; I have prayed to compose a lucubration for Helen’s adulation and my own delectation.

	Isocrates asserts that he will show this writer how this theme ought to have been treated and that he intends to avoid topics previously discussed by others and in this treatise Isocrates makes good his promise to compose a real encomium. The topics, however, which he elaborates can hardly be called original with him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The [c dimgray]Helen[/c] purports to be a serious work and is composed with care. But it is a “show-piece,” a rhetorical exercise, and follows the conventional pattern for an encomium of this nature. To students of rhetoric the [c dimgray]Helen[/c] is of interest, but for the modern reader it, like its companion-piece, [c dimgray]Busiris[/c], must be put among the least important of the compositions of Isocrates.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The praise of Theseus, to which a lengthy discussion ([c dimgray]Helen[/c] 18–38) is devoted is, as Norlin says (Isocrates, Vol. II, p. 418, L.C.L.), an effective element of variety, but because of its disproportionate length it is open to adverse criticism in an encomium of Helen. It is true that in any discourse written for Athenians the praise of their national hero would be pleasing and effective, and for Isocrates the theme was an inviting one. But the orator himself had his qualms. In [c dimgray]Helen[/c] 29 he apologetically states: “I perceive that I am being carried beyond the proper limits of my theme, and I fear that some may think that I am more concerned with Theseus than with the subject which I originally chose.” And in [c dimgray]Panathenaicus[/c] 126 he regretfully says: “I would give much not to have spoken about the virtue and the achievements of Theseus on a former occasion, for it would have been more appropriate to discuss this topic in my discourse about our city.”

	There are some who are much pleased with themselves if, after setting up an absurd and self-contradictory subject, they succeed in discussing it in tolerable fashion; and men have grown old, some asserting that it is impossible to say, or to gainsay, what is false,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] or to speak on both sides of the same questions, others maintaining that courage and wisdom and justice are identical,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and that we possess none of these as natural qualities, but that there is only one sort of knowledge concerned with them all; and still others waste their time in captious disputations that are not only entirely useless, but are sure to make trouble for their disciples.

	For my part, if I observed that this futile affectation had arisen only recently in rhetoric and that these men were priding themselves upon the novelty of their inventions, I should not be surprised at them to such degree; but as it is, who is so backward in learning as not to know that Protagoras and the sophists of his time have left to us compositions of similar character and even far more overwrought than these?

	are, or Zeno,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] who ventured to prove the same things as possible and again as impossible, or Melissus who, although things in nature are infinite in number, made it his task to find proofs that the whole is one! Nevertheless, although these men so clearly have shown that it is easy to contrive false statements on any subject that may be proposed, they still waste time on this commonplace. They ought to give up the use of this claptrap, which pretends to prove things by verbal quibbles, which in fact have long since been refuted, and to pursue the truth, to instruct their pupils in the practical affairs of our government and train to expertness therein, bearing in mind that likely conjecture about useful things is far preferable to exact knowledge of the useless, and that to be a little superior in important things is of greater worth than to be pre-eminent in petty things that are without value for living.

	because, while they condemn those who deceive in cases involving private contracts in business and those who are dishonest in what they say, yet they themselves are guilty of more reprehensible conduct; for the former wrong sundry other persons, but the latter inflict most injury upon their own pupils. And they have caused mendacity to increase to such a degree that now certain men, seeing these persons prospering from such practices, have the effrontery to write that the life of beggars and exiles is more enviable than that of the rest of mankind, and they use this as a proof that, if they can speak ably on ignoble subjects, it follows that in dealing with subjects of real worth they would easily find abundance of arguments. The most ridiculous thing of all, in my opinion, is this, that by these arguments they seek to convince us that they possess knowledge of the science of government, when they might be demonstrating it by actual work in their professed subject; for it is fitting that those who lay claim to learning and profess to be wise men should excel laymen and be better than they, not in fields neglected by everybody else, but where all are rivals. But as it is, their conduct resembles that of an athlete who, although pretending to be the best of all athletes, enters a contest in which no one would condescend to meet him. For what sensible man would undertake to praise misfortunes? No, it is obvious that they take refuge in such topics because of weakness. Such compositions follow one set road and this road is neither difficult to find, nor to learn, nor to imitate. On the other hand, discourses that are of general import, those that are trustworthy, and all of similar nature, are devised and expressed through the medium

	of a variety of forms and occasions of discourse whose opportune use is hard to learn, and their composition is more difficult as it is more arduous to practise dignity than buffoonery and seriousness than levity. The strongest proof is this: no one who has chosen to praise bumble-bees and salt[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and kindred topics has ever been at a loss for words, yet those who have essayed to speak on subjects recognized as good or noble, or of superior moral worth have all fallen far short of the possibilities which these subjects offer. For it does not belong to the same mentality to do justice to both kinds of subjects; on the contrary, while it is easy by eloquence to overdo the trivial themes, it is difficult to reach the heights of greatness of the others[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; and while on famous subjects one rarely finds thoughts which no one has previously uttered, yet on trifling and insignificant topics whatever the speaker may chance to say is entirely original.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This is the reason why, of those who have wished to discuss a subject with eloquence, I praise especially him who chose to write of Helen,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] because he has recalled to memory so remarkable a woman, one who in birth, and in beauty, and in renown far surpassed all others. Nevertheless, even he committed a slight inadvertence—for although he asserts that he has written an encomium of Helen, it turns out that he has actually spoken a defence of her conduct! But the composition in defence does not draw upon the same topics as the encomium, nor indeed does it deal with actions of the same kind, but quite the

	[m1]\ [/m]
	I will take as the beginning of my discourse the beginning of her family. For although Zeus begat very many of the demigods, of this woman alone he condescended to be called father. While he was devoted most of all to the son of Alcmena[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and to the sons of Leda,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] yet his preference for Helen, as compared with Heracles, was so great that, although he conferred upon his son strength of body, which is able to overpower all others by force, yet to her he gave the gift of beauty, which by its nature brings even strength itself into subjection to it. And knowing that all distinction and renown accrue, not from a life of ease, but from wars and perilous combats, and since he wished, not only to exalt their persons to the gods, but also to bequeath to them glory that would be immortal, he gave his son a life of labours and love of perils, and to Helen he granted the gift of nature which drew the admiration of all beholders and which in all men inspired contention.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]

	Helen not as yet in the full bloom of her beauty, but already surpassing other maidens, was so captivated by her loveliness that he, accustomed as he was to subdue others, and although the possessor of a fatherland most great and a kingdom most secure, thought life was not worth living amid the blessings he already had unless he could enjoy intimacy with her. And when he was unable to obtain her from her guardians—for they were awaiting her maturity and the fulfilment of the oracle which the Pythian priestess had given—scorning the royal power of Tyndareüs,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] disdaining the might of Castor and Pollux,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and belittling all the hazards in Lacedaemon, he seized her by force and established her at Aphidna in Attica. So grateful was Theseus to Peirithoüs, his partner in the abduction, that when Peirithoüs wished to woo Persephonê, the daughter of Zeus and Demeter, and summoned him to the descent into Hades to obtain her, when Theseus found that he could not by his warnings dissuade his friend, although the danger was manifest he nevertheless accompanied him, for he was of opinion that he owed this debt[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] of gratitude—to decline no task enjoined by Peirithoüs in return for his help in his own perilous enterprise.

	virtue, yet this hero alone was lacking in naught, but had attained consummate virtue. And it seems to me appropriate to speak of Theseus at still greater length; for I think this will be the strongest assurance for those who wish to praise Helen, if we can show that those who loved and admired her were themselves more deserving of admiration than other men. For contemporary events we should with good reason judge in accordance with our own opinions, but concerning events in times so remote it is fitting that we show our opinion to be in accord with the opinion of those men of wisdom who were at that time living.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The fairest praise that I can award to Theseus is this—that he, a contemporary of Heracles, won a fame which rivalled his. For they not only equipped themselves with similar armour, but followed the same pursuits, performing deeds that were worthy of their common origin. For being in birth the sons of brothers, the one of Zeus, the other of Poseidon, they cherished also kindred ambitions; for they alone of all who have lived before our time made themselves champions of human life. It came to pass that Heracles undertook perilous labours more celebrated and more severe, Theseus those more useful, and to the Greeks of more vital importance. For example, Heracles was ordered by Eurystheus[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] to bring the cattle from Erytheia[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and to obtain the apples of the Hesperides and to fetch Cerberus up from Hades and to perform other labours of that kind, labours which would bring no benefit to mankind, but only danger

	to himself; Theseus, however, being his own master, gave preference to those struggles which would make him a benefactor of either the Greeks at large or of his native land. Thus, the bull let loose by Poseidon which was ravaging the land of Attica, a beast which all men lacked the courage to confront, Theseus singlehanded subdued, and set free the inhabitants of the city from great fear and anxiety. And after this, allying himself with the Lapiths, he took the field against the Centaurs, those creatures of double nature, endowed with surpassing swiftness, strength, and daring, who were sacking, or about to sack, or were threatening, one city after another. These he conquered in battle and straightway put an end to their insolence, and not long thereafter he caused their race to disappear from the sight of men. At about the same time appeared the monster[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] reared in Crete, the offspring of Pasiphaë, daughter of Helius, to whom our city was sending, in accordance with an oracle’s command, tribute of twice seven children. When Theseus saw these being led away, and the entire populace escorting them, to a death savage and foreseen, and being mourned as dead while yet living, he was so incensed that he thought it better to die than to live as ruler of a city that was compelled to pay to the enemy a tribute so lamentable. Having embarked with them for Crete, he subdued this monster, half-man and half-bull, which possessed strength commensurate with its composite origin, and having rescued the children, he restored them to their parents, and thus freed the city

	But I am at a loss how to deal with what remains to be said; for, now that I have taken up the deeds of Theseus and begun to speak of them, I hesitate to stop midway and leave unmentioned the lawlessness of Sciron[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and of Cercyon and of other robbers like them whom he fought and vanquished and thereby delivered the Greeks from many great calamities. But, on the other hand, I perceive that I am being carried beyond the proper limits of my theme and I fear that some may think that I am more concerned with Theseus than with the subject which I originally chose.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] In this dilemma I prefer to omit the greater part of what might be said, out of regard for impatient hearers, and to give as concise an account as I can of the rest, that I may gratify both them and myself and not make a complete surrender to those whose habit it is out of jealousy to find fault with everything that is said.

	His courage Theseus displayed in these perilous exploits which he hazarded alone; his knowledge of war in the battles he fought in company with the whole city; his piety toward the gods in connexion with the supplications of Adrastus and the children of Heracles when, by defeating the Peloponnesians in battle, he saved the lives of the children,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and to Adrastus he restored for burial, despite the Thebans, the bodies of those who had died beneath the walls of the Cadmea[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]; and finally, he revealed

	For he saw that those who seek to rule their fellow-citizens by force are themselves the slaves of others, and that those who keep the lives of their fellow-citizens in peril themselves live in extreme fear, and are forced to make war, on the one hand, with the help of citizens against invaders from abroad, and, on the other hand, with the help of auxiliaries against their fellow citizens; further, he saw them despoiling the temples of the gods, putting to death the best of their fellow-citizens, distrusting those nearest to them, living lives no more free from care than do men who in prison await their death; he saw that, although they are envied for their external blessings, yet in their own hearts they are more miserable than all other men—for what, pray, is more grievous than to live in constant fear lest some bystander kill you, dreading no less your own guards than those who plot against you? Theseus, then, despising all these and considering such men to be not rulers, but pests, of their states, demonstrated that it is easy to exercise the supreme power and at the same time to enjoy as good relations as those who live as citizens on terms of perfect equality. In the first place, the scattered settlements and villages of which the state was composed he united, and made Athens into a city-state[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] so great that from then even to the present day it is the greatest state of Hellas: and after this, when he had established a common fatherland and had set free

	the minds of his fellow-citizens, he instituted for them on equal terms that rivalry of theirs for distinction based on merit, confident that he would stand out as their superior in any case, whether they practised that privilege or neglected it, and he also knew that honours bestowed by high-minded men are sweeter than those that are awarded by slaves.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] And he was so far from doing anything contrary to the will of the citizens that he made the people masters of the government, and they on their part thought it best that he should rule alone, believing that his sole rule was more to be trusted and more equitable than their own democracy. For he did not, as the other rulers did habitually, impose the labours upon the citizens and himself alone enjoy the pleasures; but the dangers he made his own, and the benefits he bestowed upon the people in common. In consequence, Theseus passed his life beloved of his people and not the object of their plots, not preserving his sovereignty by means of alien military force, but protected, as by a bodyguard, by the goodwill of the citizens,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] by virtue of his authority ruling as a king, but by his benefactions as a popular leader; for so equitably and so well did he administer the city that even to this day traces of his clemency may be seen remaining in our institutions.

	As for Helen, daughter of Zeus, who established her power over such excellence and sobriety, should she not be praised and honoured, and regarded as far superior to all the women who have ever lived?

	[m1]\ [/m]
	After the descent of Theseus to Hades, when Helen returned to Lacedaemon, and was now of marriageable age, all the kings and potentates of that time formed of her the same opinion; for although it was possible for them in their own cities to wed women of the first rank, they disdained wedlock at home and went to Sparta to woo Helen. And before it had yet been decided who was to be her husband and all her suitors still had an equal chance, it was so evident to all that Helen would be the object of armed contention that they met together and exchanged solemn pledges of assistance if anyone should attempt to take her away from him who had been adjudged worthy of winning her; for each thought he was providing this alliance for himself. In this their private hope all, it is true, save one man, were disappointed, yet in the general opinion which all had formed concerning her no one was mistaken. For not much later when strife arose among the goddesses for the prize of beauty, and Alexander,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] son of Priam, was appointed judge and when Hera offered him sovereignty over all Asia, Athena victory in war, and Aphrodite Helen as his wife, finding himself unable to make a distinction regarding the charms of their persons, but overwhelmed by the sight of the goddesses, Alexander, compelled to make a choice of their proffered gifts, chose living with Helen before all else. In so doing he did not look to its pleasures—although even this is thought by the wise to be preferable to many things, but nevertheless it was not this he strove for—but because he was eager to

	become a son of Zeus by marriage, considering this a much greater and more glorious honour than sovereignty over Asia, and thinking that while great dominions and sovereignties fall at times even to quite ordinary men, no man would ever in all time to come be considered worthy of such a woman; and furthermore, that he could leave no more glorious heritage to his children than by seeing to it that they should be descendants of Zeus, not only on their father’s side, but also on their mother’s. For he knew that while other blessings bestowed by Fortune soon change hands, nobility of birth abides forever with the same possessors; therefore he foresaw that this choice would be to the advantage of all his race, whereas the other gifts would be enjoyed for the duration of his own life only.

	No sensible person surely could find fault with this reasoning, but some, who have not taken into consideration the antecedent events but look at the sequel alone, have before now reviled Alexander; but the folly of these accusers is easily discerned by all from the calumnies they have uttered. Are they not in a ridiculous state of mind if they think their own judgement is more competent than that which the gods chose as best?[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For surely they did not select any ordinary arbiter to decide a dispute about an issue that had got them into so fierce a quarrel, but obviously they were as anxious to select the most competent judge as they were concerned about the matter itself.

	I am astonished that anyone should think that Alexander was ill-advised in choosing to live with Helen, for whom many demigods were willing to die. Would he not have been a fool if, knowing that the deities themselves were contending for the prize of beauty, he had himself scorned beauty, and had failed to regard as the greatest of gifts that for the possession of which he saw even those goddesses most earnestly striving?

	What man would have rejected marriage with Helen, at whose abduction the Greeks were as incensed as if all Greece had been laid waste, while the barbarians were as filled with pride as if they had conquered us all? It is clear how each party felt about the matter; for although there had been many causes of contention between them before, none of these disturbed their peace, whereas for her they waged so great a war, not only the greatest of all wars in the violence of its passions, but also in the duration of the struggle and in the extent of the preparations the greatest of all time. And although the Trojans might have rid themselves of the misfortunes which encompassed them by surrendering Helen, and the Greeks might have lived in peace for all time by being indifferent to her fate, neither so wished; on the contrary, the Trojans allowed their cities to be laid waste and their land to be ravaged, so as to avoid yielding Helen to the Greeks, and the Greeks chose rather, remaining in a foreign land to grow old there and never to see their

	own again, than, leaving her behind, to return to their fatherland. And they were not acting in this way as eager champions of Alexander or of Menelaus; nay, the Trojans were upholding the cause of Asia, the Greeks of Europe, in the belief that the land in which Helen in person resided would be the more favoured of Fortune.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So great a passion for the hardships of that expedition and for participation in it took possession not only of the Greeks and the barbarians, but also of the gods, that they did not dissuade even their own children from joining in the struggles around Troy[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; nay, Zeus, though foreseeing the fate of Sarpedon,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and Eos that of Memnon, and Poseidon that of Cycnus, and Thetis that of Achilles, nevertheless they all urged them on and sent them forth, thinking it more honourable for them to die fighting for the daughter of Zeus than to live without having taken part in the perils undergone on her account. And why should we be astonished that the gods felt thus concerning their children? For they themselves engaged in a far greater and more terrible struggle than when they fought the Giants; for against those enemies they had fought a battle in concert, but for Helen they fought a war against one another.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	With good reason in truth they came to this decision, and I, for my part, am justified in employing extravagant language in speaking of Helen; for beauty she possessed in the highest degree, and beauty is of all things the most venerated, the most precious, and the most divine. And it is easy to determine its power; for while many things which

	do not have any attributes of courage, wisdom, or justice will be seen to be more highly valued than any one of these attributes, yet of those things which lack beauty we shall find not one that is beloved; on the contrary, all are despised, except in so far as they possess in some degree this outward form, beauty, and it is for this reason that virtue is most highly esteemed, because it is the most beautiful of ways of living. And we may learn how superior beauty is to all other things by observing how we ourselves are affected by each of them severally. For in regard to the other things which we need, we only wish to possess them and our heart’s desire is set on nothing further than this; for beautiful things, however, we have an inborn passion whose strength of desire corresponds to the superiority of the thing sought. And while we are jealous of those who excel us in intelligence or in anything else, unless they win us over by daily benefactions and compel us to be fond of them, yet at first sight we become well-disposed toward those who possess beauty, and to these alone as to the gods we do not fail in our homage; on the contrary, we submit more willingly to be the slaves of such than to rule all others, and we are more grateful to them when they impose many tasks upon us than to those who demand nothing at all. We revile those who fall under the power of anything other than beauty and call them flatterers, but those who are subservient to beauty we regard as lovers of beauty and lovers of service. So strong are our feelings of reverence and solicitude for such a quality, that we hold in greater dishonour those of its possessors who have trafficked in it and ill-used their own youth than those who do violence

	[m1]\ [/m]
	But why need I waste time in citing the opinions of men? Nay, Zeus, lord of all, reveals his power in all else, but deigns to approach beauty in humble guise. For in the likeness of Amphitryon he came to Alcmena, and as a shower of gold he united with Danaë, and in the guise of a swan he took refuge in the bosom of Nemesis, and again in this form he espoused Leda; ever with artifice manifestly, and not with violence, does he pursue beauty in women. And so much greater honour is paid to beauty among the gods than among us that they pardon their own wives when they are vanquished by it; and one could cite many instances of goddesses who succumbed to mortal beauty, and no one of these sought to keep the fact concealed as if it involved disgrace; on the contrary, they desired their adventures to be celebrated in song as glorious deeds rather than to be hushed in silence. The greatest proof of my statements is this: we shall find that more mortals have been made immortal because of their beauty than for all other excellences.

	All these personages Helen surpassed in proportion as she excelled them in the beauty of her person. For not only did she attain immortality but, having won power equalling that of a god, she first raised to divine station her brothers,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] who were already in the grip of Fate, and wishing to make their transformation believed by men, she gave to them honours[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] so

	manifest that they have power to save when they are seen by sailors in peril on the sea, if they but piously invoke them. After this she so amply recompensed Menelaus for the toils and perils which he had undergone because of her, that when all the race of the Pelopidae had perished and were the victims of irremediable disasters, not only did she free him from these misfortunes but, having made him god instead of mortal, she established him as partner of her house and sharer of her throne forever. And I can produce the city of the Spartans, which preserves with especial care its ancient traditions, as witness for the fact; for even to the present day at Therapnê[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in Laconia the people offer holy and traditional sacrifices to them both, not as to heroes, but as to gods.

And some of the Homeridae also relate that Helen appeared to Homer by night and commanded him to compose a poem on those who went on the expedition to Troy, since she wished to make their death more to be envied than the life of the rest of mankind; and they say that while it is partly because of Homer’s art, yet it is chiefly through her that his poem has such charm and has become so famous among all men.

	reward, it is the duty of those who have great wealth to propitiate and to honour her with thank-offerings, sacrifices, and processions, and philosophers should endeavour to speak of her in a manner worthy of her merits; for such are the first-fruits it is fitting that men of cultivation should offer.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Far more has been passed over than has been said. Apart from the arts and philosophic studies and all the other benefits which one might attribute to her and to the Trojan War, we should be justified in considering that it is owing to Helen that we are not the slaves of the barbarians. For we shall find that it was because of her that the Greeks became united in harmonious accord and organized a common expedition against the barbarians, and that it was then for the first time that Europe set up a trophy of victory over Asia; and in consequence, we experienced a change so great that, although in former times any barbarians who were in misfortune presumed to be rulers over the Greek cities (for example, Danaus, an exile from Egypt, occupied Argos, Cadmus of Sidon became king of Thebes, the Carians colonized the islands,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and Pelops, son of Tantalus, became master of all the Peloponnese), yet after that war our race expanded so greatly that it took from the barbarians great cities and much territory. If, therefore, any orators wish to dilate upon these matters and dwell upon them, they will not be at a loss for material apart from what I have said, wherewith to praise Helen; on the contrary, they will discover many new arguments that relate to her.

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The [c dimgray]Busiris[/c], like the [c dimgray]Encomium on Helen[/c], is an epideictic essay of the “display” type, written as an eulogy of a famous personage; in this case, the subject of extravagant praise is Busiris, mythical king of Egypt.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The immediate inspiration for the [c dimgray]Encomium on Helen[/c] was a brilliant paradoxical discourse, or [c dimgray]jeu d’esprit[/c], by a rhetorician who was, in all probability, the Sicilian Gorgias.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] In his [c dimgray]Helen[/c] Isocrates criticizes this rhetorician and shows how the subject should have been treated. In the [c dimgray]Busiris[/c], likewise, the situation is similar. Poly crates,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] who had entered upon the career of a professional rhetorician because of financial need, had composed a defence
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c][c dimgray]Cf.[/c] Introduction to [c dimgray]Helen.[/c]
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]According to the Greek introduction ([c dimgray]hypothesis[/c]) to this composition Polycrates was an Athenian who practised the profession of Sophist at Cyprus. At the time when the [c dimgray]Busiris[/c] was written Polycrates was a beginner in the field of rhetoric. Before 380 b.c. Polycrates had achieved fame at Athens and is mentioned by later writers on rhetoric in company with such noted persons as Antiphon, Thrasymachus, Anaximenes and Isaeus. He is severely criticized, however, by the critics Dionysius of Halicarnassus and Demetrius. Dionysius attacks him as “empty in practical oratory, frigid and vulgar in epideictic (display rhetoric), and lacking in grace” ([c dimgray]Isaeus[/c] ch. 20), and Demetrius deplores his lack of earnestness ([c dimgray]On Style[/c] 120).

	of Busiris. Isocrates, who had never met the writer, having read this composition, addresses Polycrates and, in his customary rather patronizing manner, tells him that his work is seriously faulty in that he has written an accusation rather than a defence, and then proceeds to show him by actual example how the subject should have been handled.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The [c dimgray]Busiris[/c] is not a work of particular merit. Isocrates himself, in the Introduction to his [c dimgray]Panatkenaicus[/c], disparages subjects of this nature as trivial and unworthy, and in [c dimgray]Busiris[/c] § 9 he admits that the topic is not a serious one and does not demand a dignified style. This discourse is a rhetorical exercise, artificial in its nature, composed near the beginning of Isocrates’ professional career in Athens, probably between the years 390-385 b.c.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	I have learned of your fairmindedness, Poly crates, and of the reversal in your life, through information from others; and having myself read certain of the discourses which you have written, I should have been greatly pleased to discuss frankly with you and fully the education with which you have been obliged to occupy yourself. For I believe that when men through no fault of their own are unfortunate and so seek in philosophy a source of gain,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] it is the duty of all who have had a wider experience in that occupation, and have become more thoroughly versed in it, to make this contribution[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] voluntarily for their benefit. But since we have not yet met one another, we shall be able, if we ever do come together, to discuss the other topics at greater length; concerning those suggestions, however, by which at the present time I might be of service to you, I have thought I should advise you by letter, though concealing my views, to the best of my ability, from everyone else. I am well aware, however, that it is instinctive with most persons when admonished, not to look to the benefits they receive but, on the contrary, to listen to what is said with the greater displeasure in proportion to the rigour with which

	Having observed, therefore, that you take especial pride in your [c dimgray]Defence of Busiris[/c] and in your [c dimgray]Accusation of Socrates[/c], I shall try to make it clear to you that in both these discourses you have fallen far short of what the subject demands. For although everyone knows that those who wish to praise a person must attribute to him a larger number of good qualities than he really possesses, and accusers must do the contrary, you have so far fallen short of following these principles of rhetoric that, though you profess to defend Busiris, you have not only failed to absolve him of the calumny with which he is attacked, but have even imputed to him a lawlessness of such enormity that it is impossible for one to invent wickedness more atrocious. For the other writers whose aim was to malign him went only so far in their abuse as to charge him with sacrificing the strangers[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] who came to his country; you, however, accused him of actually devouring his victims. And when your purpose was to accuse Socrates, as if you wished to praise him, you gave Alcibiades to him as a pupil who, as far as anybody observed, never was taught by Socrates,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] but that Alcibiades far excelled all his contemporaries all would agree.

	judging what has been said of them, Socrates would be as grateful to you for your accusation as to any who have been wont to eulogize him; while Busiris, even if he had been most tender-hearted toward his guests, would be so enraged by your account of him that he would abstain from no vengeance whatever! And yet ought not that man to feel shame, rather than pride, who is more loved by those whom he has reviled than by those whom he has praised?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And you have been so careless about committing inconsistencies that you say Busiris emulated the fame of Aeolus and Orpheus, yet you do not show that any of his pursuits was identical with theirs. What, can we compare his deeds with the reported exploits of Aeolus? But Aeolus restored to their native lands strangers who were cast on his shores,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] whereas Busiris, if we are to give credence to your account, sacrificed and ate them! Or, are we to liken his deeds to those of Orpheus? But Orpheus led the dead back from Hades,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] whereas Busiris brought death to the living before their day of destiny. Consequently, I should be glad to know what, in truth, Busiris would have done if he had happened to despise Aeolus and Orpheus, seeing that, while admiring their virtues, all his own deeds are manifestly the opposite of theirs. But the greatest absurdity is this—though you have made a specialty of genealogies, you have dared to say that Busiris emulated those whose fathers even at that time had not yet been born![c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	Of the noble lineage of Busiris who would not find it easy to speak? His father was Poseidon, his mother Libya the daughter of Epaphus[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] the son of Zeus, and she, they say, was the first woman to rule as queen and to give her own name to her country. Although fortune had given him such ancestors, these alone did not satisfy his pride, but he thought he must also leave behind an everlasting monument to his own valour.

	He was not content with his mother’s kingdom, considering it too small for one of his endowment; and when he had conquered many peoples and had acquired supreme power he established his royal seat in Egypt, because he judged that country to be far superior as his place of residence, not only to the lands which then were his, but even to all other countries in the world. For he saw that all other regions are neither seasonably nor conveniently situated in relation to the nature of the universe, but some are deluged by rains and others scorched by heat; Egypt,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] however, having the most admirable situation of the universe,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] was able to produce the most abundant and most varied products, and was defended by the immortal ramparts of the Nile, a river which by its nature provides not only protection

	to the land, but also its means of subsistence in abundance, being impregnable and difficult for foes to conquer, yet convenient for commerce and in many respects serviceable to dwellers within its bounds. For in addition to the advantages I have mentioned, the Nile has bestowed upon the Egyptians a godlike power in respect to the cultivation of the land; for while Zeus is the dispenser[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of rains and droughts to the rest of mankind, of both of these each Egyptian has made himself master on his own account. And to so perfect a state of happiness have the Egyptians come that with respect to the excellence and fertility of their land and the extent of their plains they reap the fruits of a continent, and as regards the disposition of their superfluous products and the importation of what they lack, the river’s possibilities are such that they inhabit an island[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; for the Nile, encircling the land and flowing through its whole extent, has given them abundant means for both.

	So Busiris thus began, as wise men should, by occupying the fairest country and also by finding sustenance sufficient for his subjects. Afterwards, he divided them into classes[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]: some he appointed to priestly services, others he turned to the arts and crafts, and others he forced to practise the arts of war. He judged that, while necessities and superfluous products must be provided by the land and the arts, the safest means of protecting these was practice in warfare and reverence for the gods. Including in all classes the right numbers for the best administration of the commonwealth, he gave orders that the same

	individuals should always engage in the same pursuits, because he knew that those who continually change their occupations never achieve proficiency in even a single one of their tasks, whereas those who apply themselves constantly to the same activities perform each thing they do surpassingly well. Hence we shall find that in the arts the Egyptians surpass those who work at the same skilled occupations elsewhere more than artisans in general excel the laymen; also with respect to the system which enables them to preserve royalty and their political institutions in general, they have been so successful that philosophers[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] who undertake to discuss such topics and have won the greatest reputation prefer above all others the Egyptian form of government, and that the Lacedaemonians, on the other hand, govern their own city in admirable fashion because they imitate certain of the Egyptian customs. For instance, the provision that no citizen fit for military service could leave the country without official authorization, the meals taken in common, and the training of their bodies; furthermore, the fact that lacking none of the necessities of life, they do not neglect the edicts of the State, and that none engage in any other crafts, but that all devote themselves to arms and warfare, all these practices they have taken from Egypt.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] But the Lacedaemonians have made so much worse use of these institutions that all of them, being professional soldiers, claim the right to seize by force the property of everybody else, whereas the Egyptians live as people should who neither neglect their own possessions, nor plot how they may acquire the property of others. The difference in the aims of the two polities may be seen from

	the following: if we should all imitate the sloth and greed of the Lacedaemonians, we should straightway perish through both the lack of the necessities of daily life and civil war; but if we should wish to adopt the laws of the Egyptians which prescribe that some must work and that the rest must protect the property of the workers, we should all possess our own goods and pass our days in happiness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Furthermore, the cultivation of practical wisdom may also reasonably be attributed to Busiris. For example, he saw to it that from the revenues of the sacrifices the priests should acquire affluence, but self-control through the purifications prescribed by the laws, and leisure by exemption from the hazards of fighting and from all work. And the priests, because they enjoyed such conditions of life, discovered for the body the aid which the medical art affords,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] not that which uses dangerous drugs, but drugs of such a nature that they are as harmless as daily food, yet in their effects are so beneficial that all men agree the Egyptians are the healthiest and most long of life among men; and then for the soul they introduced philosophy’s training, a pursuit which has the power, not only to establish laws but also to investigate the nature of the universe. The older men Busiris appointed to have charge of the most important matters, but the younger he persuaded to forgo all pleasures and devote themselves to the study of the stars, to arithmetic, and to geometry; the value of these sciences[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] some praise for their utility in certain ways, while others attempt to demonstrate that they are conducive in the highest measure to the attainment of virtue.

	The piety of the Egyptians and their worship of the gods are especially deserving of praise and admiration. For all persons who have so bedizened themselves as to create the impression that they possess greater wisdom, or some other excellence, than they can rightly claim, certainly do harm to their dupes; but those persons who have so championed the cause of religion that divine rewards and punishments are made to appear more certain than they prove to be, such men, I say, benefit in the greatest measure the lives of men. For actually those who in the beginning inspired in us our fear of the gods, brought it about that we in our relations to one another are not altogether like wild beasts.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] So great, moreover, is the piety and the solemnity with which the Egyptians deal with these matters that not only are the oaths taken in their sanctuaries more binding than is the case elsewhere, but each person believes that he will pay the penalty for his misdeeds immediately and that he will neither escape detection for the present nor will the punishment be deferred to his children’s time. And they have good reason for this belief; for Busiris established for them numerous and varied practices of piety and ordered them by law even to worship and to revere certain animals which among us are regarded with contempt, not because he misapprehended their power, but because he thought that the crowd ought to be habituated to obedience to all the commands of those in authority, and at the same time he wished to test in visible matters how they felt in regard to the invisible. For he judged that those who belittled these instructions would perhaps look with contempt upon the more

	important commands also, but that those who gave strict obedience equally in everything would have given proof of their steadfast piety.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If one were not determined to make haste, one might cite many admirable instances of the piety of the Egyptians, that piety which I am neither the first nor the only one to have observed; on the contrary, many contemporaries and predecessors have remarked it, of whom Pythagoras of Samos is one.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] On a visit to Egypt he became a student of the religion of the people, and was first to bring to the Greeks all philosophy, and more conspicuously than others he seriously interested himself in sacrifices and in ceremonial purity, since he believed that even if he should gain thereby no greater reward from the gods, among men, at any rate, his reputation would be greatly enhanced. And this indeed happened to him. For so greatly did he surpass all others in reputation that all the younger men desired to be his pupils, and their elders were more pleased to see their sons staying in his company than attending to their private affairs. And these reports we cannot disbelieve; for even now persons who profess to be followers of his teaching are more admired when silent than are those who have the greatest renown for eloquence.

	Perhaps, however, you would reply against all I have said, that I am praising the land, the laws, and the piety of the Egyptians, and also their philosophy, but that Busiris was their author, as I have assumed, I am able to offer no proof whatever. If any other person criticized me in that fashion, I should believe that his censure was that of a scholar;

	Busiris, you chose to say that he forced the Nile to break into branches and surround the land,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]and that he sacrificed and ate strangers who came to his country; but you gave no proof that he did these things. And yet is it not ridiculous to demand that others follow a procedure which you yourself have not used in the slightest degree? Nay, your account is far less credible than mine, since I attribute to him no impossible deed, but only laws and political organization, which are the accomplishments of honourable men, whereas you represent him as the author of two astounding acts which no human being would commit, one requiring the cruelty of wild beasts, the other the power of the gods. Further, even if both of us, perchance, are wrong, I, at any rate, have used only such arguments as authors of eulogies must use; you, on the contrary, have employed those which are appropriate to revilers. Consequently, it is obvious that you have gone astray, not only from the truth, but also from the entire pattern which must be employed in eulogy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Apart from these considerations, if your discourse should be put aside and mine carefully examined, no one would justly find fault with it. For if it were manifest that another had done the deeds which I assert were done by him, I acknowledge that I am exceedingly audacious in trying to change men’s views about matters of which all the world has knowledge. But as it is, since the question is open to the judgement of all and one must resort to

	conjecture, who, reasoning from what is probable, would be considered to have a better claim to the authorship of the institutions of Egypt rather than a son of Poseidon, a descendant of Zeus on his mother’s side, the most powerful personage of his time and the most renowned among all other peoples? For surely it is not fitting that any who were in all these respects inferior should, in preference to Busiris, have the credit of being the authors of those great benefactions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Furthermore, it could be easily proved on chronological grounds also that the statements of the detractors of Busiris are false. For the same writers who accuse Busiris of slaying strangers also assert that he died at the hands of Heracles; but all chroniclers agree that Heracles was later by four generations than Perseus, son of Zeus and Danë, and that Busiris lived more than two hundred years earlier than Perseus. And yet what can be more absurd than that one who was desirous of clearing Busiris of the calumny has failed to mention that evidence, so manifest and so conclusive?

	But the fact is that you had no regard for the truth; on the contrary, you followed the calumnies of the poets, who declare that the offspring of the immortals have perpetrated as well as suffered things more atrocious than any perpetrated or suffered by the offspring of the most impious of mortals; aye, the poets have related about the gods themselves tales more outrageous than anyone would dare tell concerning their enemies. For not only have they imputed to them thefts and adulteries, and vassalage among men, but they have fabricated tales of the eating of children, the castrations of fathers, the

	fetterings of mothers, and many other crimes.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For these blasphemies the poets, it is true, did not pay the penalty they deserved, but assuredly they did not escape punishment altogether: some became vagabonds begging for their daily bread; others became blind; another spent all his life in exile from his fatherland and in warring with his kinsmen; and Orpheus, who made a point of rehearsing these tales, died by being torn asunder.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Therefore if we are wise we shall not imitate their tales, nor while passing laws for the punishment of libels against each other, shall we disregard loose-tongued vilification of the gods; on the contrary, we shall be on our guard and consider equally guilty of impiety those who recite and those who believe such lies.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	Now I, for my part, think that not only the gods but also their offspring have no share in any wickedness but themselves are by nature endowed with all the virtues and have become for all mankind guides and teachers of the most honourable conduct. For it is absurd that we should attribute to the gods the responsibility for the happy fortunes of our children, and yet believe them to be indifferent to those of their own. Nay, if any one of us should obtain the power of regulating human nature, he would not allow even his slaves to be vicious; yet we condemn the gods by believing that they permitted their own offspring to be so impious and lawless.

	Poly crates, assume that you will make men better even if they are not related to you, provided that they become your pupils, yet believe that the gods have no care for the virtue of their own children! And yet, according to your own reasoning, the gods are not free from the two most disgraceful faults: for if they do not want their children to be virtuous, they are inferior in character to human beings; but if, on the other hand, they desire it but are at a loss how to effect it, they are more impotent than the sophists!

	Although the subject admits of many arguments for the amplification of my theme of eulogy and defence, I believe it unnecessary to speak at greater length; for my aim in this discourse is not to make a display to impress others, but to show for your benefit how each of these topics should be treated, since the composition which you wrote may justly be considered by anyone to be, not a defence of Busiris, but an admission of all the crimes charged against him. For you do not exonerate him from the charges, but only declare that some others have done the same things, inventing thus a very easy refuge for all criminals. Why, if it is not easy to find a crime which has not yet been committed, and if we should consider that those who have been found guilty of one or another of these crimes have done nothing so very wrong, whenever others are found to have perpetrated the same offences, should we not be providing ready-made pleas in exculpation of all criminals and be granting complete licence for those who are bent on villainy? You would best perceive the inanity of your defence of Busiris if you should imagine yourself in his position. Just suppose this case: if you had been accused of grave and terrible

	crimes and an advocate should defend you in this fashion, what would be your state of mind? I know very well that you would detest him more heartily than your accusers. And yet is it not disgraceful to compose for others a plea in defence of such kind that it would arouse your extreme anger if spoken on your own behalf?

	Again, consider this, and meditate upon it. If one of your pupils should be induced to do those things which you praise, would he not be the most wretched of men who are now alive and, in truth, of all who ever have lived? Is it right, therefore, to compose discourses such that they will do the most good if they succeed in convincing no one among those who hear them?

	But perhaps you will say that you too were not unaware of all this but that you wished to bequeath to men of learning an example of how pleas in defence of shameful charges and difficult causes ought to be made. But I think it has now been made clear to you, even if you were previously in ignorance, that an accused person would sooner gain acquittal by not uttering a word than by pleading his cause in this way.

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	This speech is supposed to be spoken by a citizen of Plataea before the Ecclesia, or Assembly, of Athens. It is an eloquent plea to the Athenians for help against the Thebans, who in 373 b.c. had destroyed Plataea for the second time, and an appeal for aid in the restoration of the devastated town.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Plataea, a small city and district in southern Boeotia, had long been on very friendly terms with Athens. At Marathon the Plataeans, alone of all Greeks ([c dimgray]cf.[/c] § 57), had fought against the Persians by the side of the Athenians.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] In 427 b.c., after a long and desperate siege, Plataea was captured by the Thebans, the city destroyed, the citizens slain, and their territory given to the Thebans.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] The survivors took refuge in Athens and were actually given the rights of citizenship by the Athenians.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In 386 b.c. Plataea was rebuilt by Sparta and the exiled Plataeans in considerable numbers returned. Inevitably they were regarded as allies by Sparta. In 377 or 376 b.c. Plataea was compelled to join the Boeotian Confederacy headed by the Thebans, who were destined to hold the hegemony of Greece for ten years. But the hatred of the Plataeans for the Thebans was so great that Diodorus (xv. 46) says

	that the Plataeans offered their city to Athens. In the year 373 b.c (the date is probable, but not certain) the Thebans surprised the Plataeans, destroyed their town, and annexed their territory. Again, as in 427 b.c., the surviving Plataeans sought refuge at Athens.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The situation of the Plataeans was considered by the Athenian Assembly, but no help was offered and the restoration of their city at that time was not attempted. Years later, in 338 b.c., Philip of Macedon, enemy of Thebes, restored Plataea.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The date of the discourse falls between the capture of Plataea (373 b.c.) and the battle of Leuctra (371 b.c.). Mathieu[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] argues for the beginning of the year 371 b.c. and regards the [c dimgray]Plataicus[/c] as a fictitious discourse, a work of democratic propaganda in favour of Athenian hegemony. Jebb[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] believes that it is a genuine work, written for a real occasion and for actual use.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	Since we Plataeans know, Athenians, that it is your custom not only zealously to come to the rescue of victims of injustice, but also to requite your benefactors with the utmost gratitude, we have come as suppliants to beg you not to remain indifferent to our having been driven from our homes in time of peace by the Thebans. And since many peoples in the past have fled to you for protection and have obtained all they craved, we think it beseems you more than others to show solicitude for our city; for victims of a greater injustice than ourselves, or any who have been plunged into calamities so great, you could not find anywhere, nor any people who for a longer time have maintained toward your city a more loyal friendship.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Furthermore, we have come here to ask you for assistance of such a kind that your granting it will involve you in no danger whatever and yet will cause all the world to regard you as the most scrupulous and most just of all the Greeks.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If we did not observe that the Thebans have schemed to win you over, by fair means or foul, to their contention that they have done us no wrong, we could have finished our plea in a few words. But since we have reached such a state of misfortune that

	we must struggle, not only against them, but also against the ablest of your orators, men whom they have hired with our resources to be their advocates,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] we must explain our cause at greater length.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is difficult indeed not to speak inadequately on the subject of our wrongs. For what eloquence could match our misfortunes, or what orator could adequately denounce the wrongs the Thebans have done? Nevertheless, we must try to the best of our ability to make their transgressions known. And the chief cause of our indignation is that we are so far from being judged worthy of equality with the rest of the Greeks that, although we are at peace[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and although treaties exist, we not only have no share in the liberty which all the rest enjoy, but that we are not considered worthy of even a moderate condition of servitude.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	We therefore beg of you, citizens of Athens, that you listen to our plea in a friendly spirit, reflecting that for us the most preposterous outcome of all would be, if those who have always been hostile to your city shall have regained their freedom through your efforts, but we, even when we supplicate you, should fail to obtain the same treatment as is accorded to your greatest enemies.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As for the events which have occurred in the past, I see no reason why I should speak of them at length. For who does not know that the Thebans have portioned out our land for pasturage and have razed our city to the ground? But it is with respect to their argument, by which they hope to deceive you, that we shall try to inform you.

	At times, you know, they attempt to maintain that they have subjected us to this treatment because we were unwilling to be members of their federation,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But I ask you to consider, first, if on such grounds it is just to inflict penalties so contrary to justice and so cruel; next, if it seems to you consistent with the dignity of the city of the Plataeans, without their consent but under compulsion, to accept such dependence under the Thebans. For my part, I consider that there exists no people more overbearing than those who blot out the cities of each of us and compel us, when we have no use for it, to participate in their form of polity. Besides this, they are clearly inconsistent in their dealings with others and with us. For when they were unable to gain our consent, they should have gone no farther than to compel us to submit to the hegemony of Thebes as they compelled Thespiae and Tanagra; for in that case we should not have suffered irremediable misfortunes. But as it is, they have made it clear that it was not their intention to give us that status; on the contrary, it was our territory they coveted. I wonder to what precedent in the past they will appeal, and what conceivable interpretation of justice they will give, when they admit that they dictate to us in such matters. For if it is to our ancestral customs they look, they ought not to be ruling over our other cities, but far rather to be paying tribute to the Orchomenians[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; for such was the case in ancient times. And if they hold that the treaties are valid, which indeed in justice they should be, how can they avoid admitting that they are guilty of wrong and are violating them?

	For these treaties direct that our cities, the small as well as the large, shall all alike be autonomous.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I imagine that on the subject of the treaties they will not venture to show their impudence, but will resort to the argument that we were taking the side of the Lacedaemonians in the war and that by destroying us they have benefited the entire confederacy.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] In my opinion, however, no complaint and no accusation should have greater validity than the oaths and the treaties. Nevertheless, if any people are to suffer because of their alliance with the Lacedaemonians, it was not the Plataeans who, of all the Greeks, if justice were done, would have been selected; for it was not of our own free will, but under compulsion, that we were subservient to the Lacedaemonians. Why, who could believe that we had reached such a degree of folly as to have valued more highly a people who reduced our fatherland to slavery than the people who had given us a share in their own city?[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] No indeed, but it was difficult for us to attempt a revolt when we had so small a city ourselves and the Lacedaemonians possessed power so great, and when besides a Spartan governor occupied it with a garrison, and also a large army was stationed at Thespiae,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] of such strength that we should have been destroyed by it not only more quickly than by the Thebans, but also with greater right. For it was not fitting that the Thebans in time of peace should harbour a grudge against us for what happened at that time, whereas the Lacedaemonians, if they had been betrayed by us during the war, with good reason would have punished us

What conclusion must we suppose that these others will reach, if they hear that the Thebans have persuaded the Athenian people that none ought to be spared who have been subject to the Lacedaemonians? For it will be clearly evident that the Thebans’ argument has no other meaning; since it is no accusation against our city in particular that has led them to destroy it but, on the contrary, they will be able to bring that same charge also against those others. These are matters which demand your deliberation and concern, lest the overbearing ways of the Thebans shall reconcile those who formerly hated the rule of the Lacedaemonians and cause them to believe that the alliance with them is their own salvation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Remember also that you undertook your most recent war,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] not to secure the freedom of either yourselves or your allies (for you all enjoyed that already), but in behalf of those who were being deprived of their autonomy in violation of the oaths and covenants. But surely it would be the most outrageous thing in the world, if you are going to permit these cities, which you thought ought not to be in servitude to the Lacedaemonians, now to be destroyed by the Thebans—men who are so far from emulating your clemency that it would have been better for us to suffer at the hands of this city that fate which is regarded as the most dreadful of all misfortunes, to be taken prisoners of war, than to have got them as neighbours; for those whose cities were taken by you by storm were straightway

	freed of a Spartan governor and of slavery, and now they have share in a Council and in freedom, whereas, of those who live anywhere near the Thebans, some are no less slaves than those who have been bought with money, and as for the rest, the Thebans will not stop until they have brought them to the condition in which we now are. They accuse the Lacedaemonians because they occupied the Cadmea and established garrisons in their cities, yet they themselves, not sending garrisons, but razing the walls of some and entirely destroying others, think they have committed no atrocity; nay, they have come to such a pitch of shamelessness that while they demand that all their allies should be guardians of the safety of Thebes, yet they arrogate to themselves the right to impose slavery upon everybody else. And yet what man would not detest the greedy spirit of these Thebans, who seek to rule the weaker, but think they must be on terms of equality with the stronger and who begrudge your city the territory ceded by the Oropians,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] yet themselves forcibly seize and portion out territory not their own?

	And not content with their other base misrepresentations, they now say that they pursued this course for the common good of the allies.

	is, having now pillaged our possessions, acting alone, they have come here to give a share of their disrepute to all their allies. And that disrepute, if you are wise, you will shun, since it is far more honourable to compel them to emulate your scrupulousness than that you allow yourselves to be persuaded to share in the lawlessness of these people, whose principles are wholly alien to those of the rest of mankind. For I presume that it is clear to all that it is incumbent upon the wise, in time of war to strive in every way to get the better of the enemy, but when peace is made, to regard nothing as of greater importance than their oaths and their covenants. The Thebans, however, in the former circumstances, in all their embassies would plead the cause of “freedom” and “independence”; but now that they believe they have secured licence for themselves, disregarding everything else, they have the effrontery to speak in defence of their private gain and of their own acts of violence, and they assert that it is to the advantage of their allies that the Thebans should have our country—fools that they are, not to know that no advantage ever accrues to those who unjustly seek greedy gain; on the contrary, many a people that have unjustly coveted the territory of others have with justice brought into the greatest jeopardy their own.

	But one thing the Thebans will not be able to say—that they remain loyal to their associates, though there is reason to fear that we, having recovered our country, will desert to the Lacedaemonians; for you will find, Athenians, that we have twice been besieged[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and forced to surrender because of our friendship for you, while the Thebans often have

	wronged this city. It would be a laborious task to recount their treacheries in the past, but when the Corinthian war broke out because of their overbearing conduct and the Lacedaemonians had marched against them, although the Thebans had been saved by you, they were so far from showing their gratitude for this service that, when you had put an end to the war, they abandoned you and entered into the alliance with the Lacedaemonians. The people of Chios, of Mytilenê, and of Byzantium remained loyal, but the Thebans, although they dwelt in a city of such importance, did not have the fortitude even to remain neutral, but were guilty of such cowardice and baseness as to give their solemn oath to join the Lacedaemonians in attacking you, the saviours of their city. For this they were punished by the gods, and, after the Cadmea was captured, they were forced to take refuge here in Athens. By this they furnished the crowning proof of their perfidy; for when they had again been saved by your power and were restored to their city, they did not remain faithful for a single instant, but immediately sent ambassadors to Lacedaemon, showing themselves ready to be slaves and to alter in no respect their former agreements with Sparta. Why need I speak at greater length? For if the Lacedaemonians had not ordered them to take back their exiles and exclude the murderers, nothing would have hindered them from taking the field as allies of those who had injured them, against you their benefactors.

	have seen fit to demand for themselves forgiveness for their evil deeds willingly committed and so monstrous, yet to us, for acts done under compulsion, they think no mercy ought to be shown, but they, true Thebans as they are, have the effrontery to reproach others for siding with the Lacedaemonians, when they, as we all know, have for the longest time been in servitude to them and have fought more zealously for Spartan domination than for their own security! In what invasion into your country of all that have ever been made have they failed to take part? Who, more consistently than they, have been your enemies and ill-wishers?

	wish to speak on their behalf only this—that Boeotia is now fighting in defence of your country, and that, if you put an end to your friendship with them, you will be acting to the detriment of your allies; for it will be a matter of great consequence if the city of Thebes takes the side of the Lacedaemonians. My opinion is, however, that it is neither profitable to the allies that the weaker should be in servitude to the stronger (in past times, in fact, we went to war to protect the weak), nor that the Thebans will be so mad as to desert the alliance and hand over their city to the Lacedaemonians; this is not because I have confidence in the character of the Thebans, but because I know that they are well aware that one of two fates necessarily awaits them—either resisting, to die and to suffer such cruelties as they have inflicted, or else, going into exile, to be in want and deprived of all their hopes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Well then, are their relations with their fellow-citizens agreeable, some of whom they have put to death and others they have banished and robbed of their property? Or are they on friendly terms with the other Boeotians, whom they not only attempt to rule without warrant of justice, but have also in some instances razed their walls and have dispossessed others of their territory? But assuredly they cannot again take refuge in your city either, Athenians, the city which they will be discovered to have so consistently betrayed. It is inconceivable, therefore, that they will care to get into a quarrel with you over an alien city[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and on that account so rashly and so inevitably to lose their own; on the contrary, in all their dealings with you they will behave in much more seemly fashion, and the more they fear for

	themselves the more they will cultivate your friendship. Indeed they have proved to you how people of such character should be treated by their conduct in the matter of Oropus[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; for when they hoped that they would have licence to do as they pleased they did not treat you as allies, but as ruthlessly wronged you as they would have dared to act against their deadliest enemies. But as soon as you in requital voted to exclude them from the peace,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] they left off their arrogance and came to you in more humble mood than we Plataeans are in now. If, then, some of their orators seek to frighten you, arguing that there is danger of the Thebans’ changing sides and going over to the enemy, you must not credit what they say; for they are constrained by compulsions so peremptory that they would much sooner submit to your government than tolerate the alliance with the Lacedaemonians.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But even if they were likely to act altogether otherwise, not even then, in my opinion, does it become you to have greater regard for the city of the Thebans than for your oaths and treaties, when you remember, first, that it is your ancient tradition to fear, not dangers, but acts of infamy and dishonour; next, that it usually happens that victory in war is not for those who destroy cities by violence, but for those who govern Greece in a more scrupulous and clement manner.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] And this could be proved by numerous instances; but as for those which have occurred in our own time at any rate, who does not know that the Lacedaemonians shattered your power,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] which was thought to be irresistible—although

	at first they possessed slight resources for the war waged at sea, but they won the Greeks over to their side because of that general belief—and that you in turn took the leadership away from them, although you depended on a city without walls and in evil plight,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but possessed Justice as your ally? And that the Persian king was not responsible for this outcome recent years have clearly shown; for when he stood aloof from the conflict, and your situation was desperate, and when almost all the cities were in servitude to the Lacedaemonians, nevertheless you were so superior to them in the war that they were glad to see the conclusion of peace.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Let no one of you, then, be afraid, if Justice is with him, to take such dangers upon himself, nor think that allies will be lacking, if you are willing to aid all who are victims of wrong, and not the Thebans alone; if you now cast your vote against them, you will cause many to desire your friendship. For if you show yourselves ready to war upon all alike in defence of the treaties, who will be so insane as to prefer to join those who try to enslave than to be in company with you who are fighting for their freedom? But if you are not so minded, what reason will you give, if war breaks out again, to justify your demand that the Greeks should join you, if you hold out to them independence and then grant to the Thebans to destroy any city they desire? How can you avoid the charge of acting with inconsistency if, while you do not prevent the Thebans from violating their oaths and treaties, yet you pretend that you

	are making war on the Lacedaemonians on behalf of the same obligations? Or again, if you abandoned your own possessions in your desire to strengthen the alliance as much as possible, yet are about to permit the Thebans to keep the territory of others and act in such fashion as to injure your reputation with all the world?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But this would be the crowning outrage—if you have determined to stand by those who have been the constant allies of the Lacedaemonians when the Lacedaemonians demand of them an action which violates the treaty, and yet shall permit us, who have been your allies for the longest time, and were subservient to the Lacedaemonians under compulsion in the last war only, to become for that reason the most miserable of all mankind. For who could be found to be more unhappy than we are who, in one day deprived of our city, our lands, and our possessions, and being destitute of all necessities alike, have become wanderers and beggars, not knowing whither to turn and, whatever our habitation, finding no happiness there? For if we fall in with the unfortunate, we grieve that we must be compelled, in addition to our own ills, to share in the ills of others; and if we encounter those who fare well, our lot is even harder to bear, not because we envy them their prosperity, but because amid the blessings of our neighbours we see more clearly our own miseries—miseries so great that we spend no day without tears, but spend all our time mourning the loss of our fatherland and bewailing the change in our fortunes.

But our greatest anguish of all is when one sees separated from each other, not only citizens from citizens, but also wives from husbands, daughters from mothers, and every tie of kinship severed; and this has befallen many of our fellow-citizens because of poverty. For the destruction of our communal life has compelled each of us to cherish hopes for himself alone. I presume that you yourselves are not ignorant of the other causes of shame that poverty and exile bring in their train,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and although we in our hearts bear these with greater difficulty than all the rest, yet we forbear to speak of them since we are ashamed to enumerate one by one our own misfortunes.

	restore to us our own. Furthermore, it is not reasonable that, while every individual who is the victim of injustice receives pity at your hands, yet an entire city so lawlessly destroyed should be unable in the slightest degree to win commiseration from you, especially when it has taken refuge with you who in former times incurred neither shame nor infamy when you showed pity for suppliants. For when the Argives came to your ancestors and implored them to take up for burial the bodies of the dead at the foot of the Cadmea,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] your forefathers yielded to their persuasion and compelled the Thebans to adopt measures more conformable to our usage, and thus not only gained renown for themselves in those times, but also bequeathed to your city a glory never to be forgotten for all time to come, and this glory it would be unworthy of you to betray. For it is disgraceful that you should pride yourselves on the glorious deeds of your ancestors and then be found acting concerning your suppliants in a manner the very opposite of theirs.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And yet the entreaties that we have come here to make are of far more weight and are more just; for the Argives came to you as suppliants after they had invaded an alien territory, whereas we have come after having lost our own; they called upon you to take up the bodies of their dead, but we do it for the rescue of the survivors. But it is not an equal or even similar evil that the dead should be denied burial and that the living should be despoiled of their fatherland and all their goods besides: nay, in the former case it is a greater disgrace for those who prevent the burial than for those who suffer the misfortune, but in the latter, to have no refuge, to be

	without a fatherland, daily to suffer hardships and to watch without having the power to succour the suffering of one’s own, why need I say how far this has exceeded all other calamities?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For these reasons we supplicate you one and all, Athenians, to restore to us our land and city, reminding the older men among you how piteous a thing it is that men of their age should be seen in misfortune and in lack of their daily bread; and the younger men we beg and implore to succour their equals in age and not to let them suffer still more evils than those I have described. Alone of the Greeks you Athenians owe us this contribution of succour, to rescue us now that we have been driven from our homes. It is a just request, for our ancestors, we are told, when in the Persian War your fathers had abandoned this land, alone of those who lived outside of the Peloponnesus shared in their perils and thus helped them to save their city.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] It is but just, therefore, that we should receive in return the same benefaction which we first conferred upon you.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	If, however, you have determined to have no regard for our persons, yet it is not in your interest to let our country at any rate be ravaged, a country in which are left the most solemn memorials of your own valour and of that of all the others who fought at your side. For while all other trophies have been erected by one city victorious over another, those were in commemoration of the victory of all Greece pitted against all the power of Asia. Although the Thebans have good reason for destroying these trophies, since memorials of the events of that time bring shame to them, yet it is proper that you should preserve them; for the deeds done there gave you

And it is right that you should remember both the gods and the heroes who haunt that place and not permit the honours due them to be suppressed; for it was after favourable sacrifice to them that you took upon yourselves a battle so decisive that it established the freedom of both the Thebans and all the other Greeks besides. You must also take some thought of your ancestors and not be negligent of the piety due to them. Pray what would be their feelings—if we may assume that the dead yonder possess any perception of what takes place here[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—if they should perceive that, although you are masters, those who saw fit to be the slaves of barbarians had become despots over all the other Greeks and that we, who fought at your side for freedom, alone of the Greeks, have been driven from our homes, and that the graves of their companions in peril do not receive the customary funereal offerings through the lack of those to bring them, and that the Thebans, who were drawn up in battle array with the enemy, hold sway over that land? Remember, too, that you used to bring bitter reproach against the Lacedaemonians because, to gratify the Thebans who were the betrayers of Greece, they destroyed us, its benefactors. Do not, therefore, allow your city to incur these foul accusations and do not prefer the insolence of the Thebans to your own fair fame.

	[b]The Team Of Horses[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	This discourse, one of the six extant forensic speeches of Isocrates, was written for a defendant in an action for damage (δίκη βλάβης) for the sum of five talents. The speaker is the younger Alcibiades, son of the famous Alcibiades, who, on reaching his majority (about 397 b.c.), was sued by Teisias, an Athenian citizen, on the ground that the elder Alcibiades had robbed him of a team of four race-horses.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Alcibiades had entered seven four-horse chariots at the Olympic festival (probably in 416 b.c.). The city of Argos had originally owned one of these teams and the alleged robbery of this team by Alcibiades is the subject of this suit.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Plutarch in his [c dimgray]Life of Alcibiades gives[/c] an account of the affair. He says that Alcibiades had been commissioned by an Athenian citizen named Diomedes to buy a chariot and team of Argos. This team was bought by Alcibiades and was entered at Olympia as his own. The suit followed, and Isocrates, according to Plutarch, wrote a speech for the defence. Slightly different versions are given by the historian Diodorus xiii. 74.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The confusion of names (Diomedes in Diodorus and Plutarch, and Teisias in our speech) is accounted

	for by Blass ([c dimgray]Die attische Beredsamkeit[/c] ii. p. 205) as being an error on the part of Ephorus, the source of Diodorus. It may well be, however, that two individuals, Diomedes and Teisias, had joined in furnishing the money for the purchase of the team and that the suit, which had been delayed until after the death of the elder Alcibiades, was brought by Teisias as the survivor.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The first part of the extant speech, the part which contained the statement of facts and the citation of evidence, is missing. The part which we have is largely a defence by the younger Alcibiades of his father’s life and a eulogy of his character and deeds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Some critics have thought that the speech, because of its nature and style and its extravagant praise of an unpopular and scandalous person, was not written for a genuine occasion in court, but is a mere display-piece, or a model for pupils. This view, however, lacks convincing proof. As for the conjectural date of the speech, Blass gives 397 b.c.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	So then, concerning the team of horses[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—that my father was in possession of them, not by having taken them away from Teisias, but by having purchased them from the Argive state—you have heard both the Argive ambassadors and the others conversant with the facts testify. But in just this same fashion all are accustomed maliciously to accuse me. For they obtain leave to bring actions against me on private complaints, but make their accusations on behalf of the interests of the state, and they spend more time in slandering my father than they do in informing you with respect to their sworn charges; and so great is their contempt of the law that they claim personal satisfaction from me for the wrongs which, as they say, you suffered at my father’s hands. But it is my opinion that charges involving the public interest have nothing to do with private suits; but as Teisias often reproaches me with my father’s banishment, and is more zealous concerning your affairs than he is regarding his own, I must address my defence to these matters. Certainly I should be

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]It should be noted that we have only the second part of

	Now so far as the older men are concerned, a brief statement could have sufficed: for they all know that the same men were responsible for the destruction of the democracy and for my father’s exile; but for the benefit of the younger men, who have lived after the events and have often heard the slanderers, I will begin my exposition from an earlier time.

	Now the persons who first plotted against the democracy and established the Four Hundred,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] inasmuch as my father, although he was repeatedly invited to join them would not do so, seeing that he was a vigorous opponent of their activities and a loyal supporter of the people, judged that they were powerless to upset the established order until he was removed out of their way. And since they knew that in matters pertaining to the gods the city would be most enraged if any man should be shown to be violating the Mysteries,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and that in other matters if any man should dare to attempt the overthrow of the democracy, they combined both these charges and tried to bring an action of impeachment before the senate. They asserted that my father was holding meetings of his political club with a view to revolution, and that these members of the club, when dining together in the house of Pulytion,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] had given a performance of the Mysteries. The city was greatly excited by reason of the gravity of the charges, and a meeting of the Assembly was hastily called at which my father so clearly proved that the

	accusers were lying that the people would have been glad to punish them, and furthermore elected him general for the Sicilian expedition.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Thereupon he sailed away, judging that he had been already cleared of their calumnies; but his accusers, having united the Council and having made the public speakers subservient to themselves, again revived the matter and suborned informers. Why need I say more? They did not cease until they had recalled my father from the expedition and had put to death some of his friends and had banished others from the city. But when he had learned the power of his enemies and the misfortunes of his friends, although he was of opinion that he was being grossly wronged because they would not try him when he was in Athens but were for condemning him in his absence, not even in these circumstances did my father see fit to desert to the enemy; on the contrary, even in exile he was so scrupulous to avoid injuring his city that he went to Argos and remained quietly there. But his enemies reached such a pitch of insolence that they persuaded you to banish him from Greece entirely, to inscribe his name on a column as a traitor, and to send envoys to demand his surrender by the Argives. And he, being at a loss to know what to do in the misfortunes which encompassed him and everywhere hemmed him in, as he saw no other means of safety, was compelled at last to take refuge with the Lacedaemonians.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	These are the actual facts; but such an excess of insolence have my father’s enemies that they accuse him, who was exiled in so illegal a manner as if he had committed outrageous crimes, and try to ruin his reputation by saying that he caused the

And sometimes they pretend to despise him,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] saying that in no respect did he excel his contemporaries; yet at the present time they blame him for all that has happened and say that the Lacedaemonians have learned from him the art of war—they who can teach the rest of the world this accomplishment! As for me, if I had sufficient time, I could easily prove that some of those things he did justly, but that others are unjustly imputed to him. Yet the most shocking thing that could happen would be this—if, while after his exile my father was recompensed, I, because he was exiled, should be penalized.

Wherefore you should reflect how each of you was affected, what thoughts you each had, and what peril each would not have undergone so as to bring his own banishment to an end and to return to his native land, and to be avenged on those who banished him. To what city, or friend, or stranger did you not apply, to entreat them to help you to get back to your country? From what effort did you abstain in your endeavours to be restored? Did you not seize the Piraeus and destroy the crops in the fields and harry the land and set fire to the suburbs and finally assault the walls? And so vehemently did you believe that these actions

	were justifiable that you were more indignant with those of your fellow-exiles who were inactive than with those who had been the authors of your misfortunes. It is not fair, therefore, to censure those who wanted the same things which you desired, nor yet to regard all those men as base who, when they were exiles, sought to return, but much more should you condemn those oligarchs who, remaining in Athens, did deeds which deserved the penalty of exile; nor is it fair that you, in judging what sort of citizen my father was, should begin at the time when he had no part in the city’s affairs; on the contrary, you should look to that earlier time and observe how he served the people before his exile, and call to mind that with two hundred heavy-armed soldiers he caused the most powerful cities in the Peloponnesus to revolt from the Lacedaemonians,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and brought them into alliance with you, and in what perils he involved the Lacedaemonians themselves, and how he behaved as general in Sicily. For these services he is deserving of your gratitude; but for that which happened when he was in misfortune it is those who banished him whom you would justly hold responsible.

	Remember, too, I beg you, the many benefits he conferred upon the city after his return from exile, and, even before that time, the state of affairs here when you received him back: the democracy had been overthrown,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] the citizens were in a state of civil war, the army was disaffected toward the government established here, and both parties had reached such a state of madness that neither had any hope of salvation.

	were making overtures to the Spartan forces in Decelea, judging that it was preferable to hand over their country to its enemies rather than to give a share in the rights of citizenship to those who were fighting for the city. Such was the state of mind of the citizens: the enemy was in control of land and sea; your financial resources were exhausted, while the Persian king was supplying them with funds; furthermore, ninety ships had come from Phoenicia[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] to Aspendus[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and were prepared to aid the Lacedaemonians. By so many misfortunes and such perils was the city beset when the army summoned my father, and he did not treat them with disdain in their plight, nor did he rebuke them for the past, nor did he deliberate about the future; on the contrary, he chose at once to suffer any misfortune with his country rather than to enjoy prosperity with the Lacedaemonians, and he made it manifest to all that he was warring on those who had banished him and not on you, and that his heart was set on a return to Athens and not on her ruin. Having thrown in his lot with you, he persuaded Tissaphernes[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] not to furnish the Lacedaemonians with money, checked the defection of your allies, distributed pay from his own resources to the soldiers, restored political power to the people, reconciled the citizens, and turned back the Phoenician fleet.

	I am aware that I am omitting many of my father’s exploits as your general; I have not recounted them in detail because nearly all of you recall the facts. But my father’s private life they revile with excessive indecency and audacity, and they are not ashamed, now that he is dead, to use a licence of speech concerning him which they would have feared to employ while he lived. Nay, they have come to such a pitch of folly that they think they will win repute with both you and with the world at large if they indulge in the wildest possible abuse of him; as if all did not know that it is in the power of the vilest of men to abuse with insulting words, not only the best of men, but even the gods. Perhaps it is foolish for me to take to heart all that has been said; nevertheless, I desire very much to recount to you my father’s private pursuits, going back a little to make mention of his ancestors, that you may know that from early times our standing and services have been the greatest and most honourable among the citizens of Athens.

And during the forty years[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] of civic discord the Alcmeonidae were hated so much more bitterly than all other Athenians by the tyrants that whenever the tyrants had the upper hand they not only razed their dwellings, but even dug up their tombs[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]; and so completely were the Alcmeonidae trusted by their fellow-exiles that they continued during all that time to be leaders of the people. At last, Alcibiades and Cleisthenes[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]—the former my great-grandfather on my father’s side, the latter my father’s maternal great-grandfather—assuming the leadership of those in exile, restored the people to their country, and drove out the tyrants. And they established that democratic form of government which so effectively trained the citizens in bravery that single-handed they conquered in battle[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] the barbarians who had attacked all Greece; and they won so great renown for justice that the Greeks voluntarily put in their hands the dominion of the sea; and they made Athens so great in her power and her other resources that those who allege that she is the capital of Greece[c dimgray][sup]f[/sup][/c] and habitually apply to her similar exaggerated expressions appear to be speaking the truth.

	as I have shown, so ancient, genuine, and based upon services of the greatest importance, my father inherited from his ancestors. My father himself was left an orphan (for his father[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] died in battle at Coronea[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]) and became the ward of Pericles, whom all would acknowledge to have been the most moderate, the most just, and the wisest of the citizens. For I count this also among his blessings that, being of such origin, he was fostered, reared, and educated under the guardianship of a man of such character. When he was admitted to citizenship, he showed himself not inferior to those whom I have mentioned, nor did he think it fitting that he should lead a life of ease, pluming himself upon the brave deeds of his ancestors; on the contrary, from the beginning he was so fired with ambition that he thought that even their great deeds should be held in remembrance through his own. And first of all, when Phormio[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] led a thousand of the flower of Athenian soldiers to Thrace,[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] my father served with this expedition, and so distinguished himself in the perilous actions of the campaign that he was crowned and received a full suit of armour from his general. Really what is required of the man who is thought worthy of the highest praise? Should he not, when serving with the bravest of the citizens, be thought worthy of the prize of valour, and when leading an army against the best of the Greeks in all the battles show his superiority to them? My father, then, in his youth did win that prize of valour and in later life did achieve the latter.

	After this he married my mother[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; and I believe that in her he also won a glorious prize of valour. For her father was Hipponicus,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] first in wealth of all the Greeks and second in birth to none of the citizens, most honoured and admired of his contemporaries. The richest dowry and fairest reputation went with his daughter’s hand; and although all coveted union with her, and only the greatest thought themselves worthy, it was my father whom Hipponicus chose from among them all and desired to make his son-in-law.

	done, and they were of such excellence that he came out first, second, and third.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Besides this, his generosity in the sacrifices and in the other expenses connected with the festival was so lavish and magnificent that the public funds of all the others[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] were clearly less than the private means of Alcibiades alone. And when he brought his mission to an end he had caused the successes of his predecessors to seem petty in comparison with his own and those who in his own day had been victors to be no longer objects of emulation, and to future breeders of racing-steeds he left behind no possibility of surpassing him. With regard to my father’s services here in Athens as choregus and gymnasiarch and trierarch[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] I am ashamed to speak; for so greatly did he excel in all the other public duties that, although those who have served the state in less splendid fashion sing their own praises therefor, if anyone should on my father’s behalf ask for a vote of thanks even in recognition of services as great as his, he would seem to be talking about petty things.

	a more loyal friend of the people than those who had gained the highest repute, that while, as you will find, the others stirred up sedition for selfish advantage, he was incurring danger on your behalf. For his devotion to the democracy was not that of one who was excluded from the oligarchy, but of one who was invited to join it: indeed, time and again when it was in his power as one of a small group, not only to rule the rest, but even to dominate them, he refused, choosing rather to suffer the city’s unjust penalties rather than to be traitor to our form of government. Of the truth of these statements no one would have convinced you as long as you still continued to be governed as a democracy; but as it was, the civil conflicts which arose clearly showed who were the democrats and who the oligarchs, as well as those who desired neither regime, and those who laid claim to a share in both. In these uprisings your enemies twice exiled my father: on the first occasion, no sooner had they got him out of the way than they abolished the democracy; on the second, hardly had they reduced you to servitude than they condemned him to exile before any other citizen; so exactly did my father’s misfortunes affect the city and he share in her disasters. And yet many of the citizens were ill disposed toward him in the belief that he was plotting a tyranny; they held this opinion, not on the basis of his deeds, but in the thought that all men aspire to this power and that he would have the best chance of attaining it. Wherefore you would justly feel the greater gratitude to him because, while he alone of the citizens was powerful enough to have this charge[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] brought against him, he was of opinion that as regards political

	Because of the multitude of things that might be said on my father’s behalf I am at a loss which of them it is appropriate to mention on the present occasion and which should be omitted.

Well then, when Athens was prosperous, who of the citizens was more prosperous, more admired, or more envied than my father? And when she suffered ill-fortune, who was deprived of brighter hopes, or of greater wealth, or of fairer repute? Pin-ally, when the Thirty Tyrants established their rule, while the others merely suffered exile from Athens, was he not banished from all Greece? Did not the Lacedaemonians and Lysander[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] exert themselves as much to cause his death as to bring about the downfall of your dominion, in the belief that they could not be sure of the city’s loyalty if they demolished her walls[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] unless they should also destroy the man who could rebuild them? Thus it is not only from his services to you, but also from what he suffered on your account, that you may easily recognize his loyalty. For it is self-evident that it was the people he was aiding, that he desired the same form of government as yourselves, that he suffered at the hands of the same persons, that he was unfortunate when the

And yet how could one prove himself to be a baser friend or a viler enemy? And then do you, Teisias, his brother-in-law and a member of the Council in the time of the Thirty Tyrants, have the hardihood to rake up old grudges against those of the other side, and are you not ashamed to be violating the terms of the amnesty which permits you to reside in the city, nor do you even reflect that, whenever the decision shall be made to exact punishment for past crimes, it is you who are menaced by danger more speedy and greater than mine? For surely they will not inflict punishment on me for my father’s acts and at the same time pardon you for the crimes you yourself have committed! No, assuredly it will not be found that your pleas in extenuation are anything like his! For you were not banished from your native land, but on the contrary you were a member of the government: you did not act under compulsion, but you were a willing agent; it was not in self-defence, but on your own initiative, that you were wronging your fellow-citizens, so that it is not fitting that you should be permitted by them even to enter a plea in your defence.

	Teisias, very likely some day at his trial I shall have the opportunity of speaking at greater length. But as for you, men of the jury, I beg you not to abandon me to my enemies nor entangle me in the net of irremediable misfortunes. For even now I have had sufficient experience of evils, since at my birth I was left an orphan through my father’s exile and my mother’s death; and I was not yet four years of age when I was brought into peril of my life owing to my father’s exile; and while still a boy I was banished from the city by the Thirty. And when the men of the Piraeus[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] were restored, and all the rest recovered their possessions, I alone by the influence of my personal enemies was deprived of the land which the people gave us as compensation for the confiscated property.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] And after having already suffered so many misfortunes and having twice lost my property,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] I am now the defendant in an action involving five talents.[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] And although the complaint involves money, the real issue is my right to continue to enjoy citizenship. For although the same penalties are prescribed for all by our laws, yet the legal risk is not the same for all; on the contrary, the wealthy risk a fine, but those who are in straitened circumstances, as is the case with me, are in danger of disfranchisement, and this is a misfortune greater, in my opinion, than exile; for it is a far more wretched fate to live among one’s fellow-citizens deprived of civic rights than to dwell an alien among foreigners. I entreat you, therefore, to aid me and not to suffer me to be despitefully

The facts in the case would of themselves justly win for me your pity, even if I have not the power by my words to evoke it, since pity truly should be felt for those who are unjustly brought to trial, who are fighting for the greatest stakes, whose present condition is not in accordance with their own worth or with that of their ancestors, seeing that they have been deprived of immense wealth and have experienced life’s greatest vicissitudes.

	Although I have many reasons for lamenting my fate, I am especially indignant for these reasons: first, if I must be punished by this man, who should justly be punished by me; second, if I shall lose my civic rights by reason of my father’s victory at Olympia, when I see other men richly rewarded for such a victory[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; and, in addition, if Teisias, a man who never did the city any good, is to remain powerful in the democracy just as he was in the oligarchy, whereas I, who injured neither party, am to be ill-treated by both; and finally, if, while in all other matters your actions are to be the opposite of those of the Thirty, you shall in regard to me show the same spirit as they, and if I, who then lost my fatherland in company with you, shall now be deprived of it by you.

	[b]Trapeziticus[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The discourse [c dimgray]Trapeziticus[/c], or the “Speech pertaining to the Banker” as the title might be fully rendered, is a composition of considerable importance as it gives information about banking in ancient Athens[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and throws light on the relations existing between Athens and the Kingdom of Bosporus. The banker involved in the case is one of the best known to us of his profession in Athens, since information concerning him is found in several of the orations of Demosthenes ([c dimgray]e.g., For Phormio[/c]).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The career of Pasion is of interest. He had been a slave of the bankers Antisthenes and Archestratus, but was given his freedom because of his services and succeeded them in the bank. One of his clients was the father of Demosthenes. Because of services rendered to the state Pasion was given the rights of citizenship by the Athenians.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The [c dimgray]Trapeziticus[/c] was written by Isocrates for a young man, a subject of Satyrus, king of Bosporus (the Crimea of to-day), who accuses the banker Pasion of having appropriated a deposit of money which had been entrusted to him by the complainant. The interesting facts of the case are given in detail by the speaker.

	[m1]\ [/m][b]Trapeziticus[/b]
	The date of the discourse may be placed about the year 393 b.c. for two reasons: the Spartan hegemony of the sea is referred to as in the past (§ 36) and the battle of Cnidus, where the Spartan fleet was defeated by the Athenians under Conon, took place in August, 394 b.c., and Satyrus I of Bosporus is still living, as seen from the reference in § 57 of the speech. According to Diodorus (xiv. 93) Satyrus died in 393 b.c.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The issue of this case, like that of so many other trials of antiquity, is unknown. In any case the business of Pasion, who enjoyed an excellent reputation as a banker in Athens, continued to prosper and at his death, in 370–369 b.c., he left his bank to his freedman Phormio to be carried on.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There is no reason to doubt the authenticity of this discourse; on the contrary, its genuineness is attested by the famous literary critic Dionysius of Halicarnassus in his critical essay on Isocrates (19–20). In fact, Dionysius quotes and criticizes the first twelve sections of the [c dimgray]Trapeziticus[/c] in Chapter 19 of his essay.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]Benseler thought the speech spurious because of the frequency of hiatus.

	This trial, men of the jury, is an important one for me. For I have at stake, not only a large sum of money, but also my reputation—for I risk being thought to covet what justly belongs to another; and that is what gives me the greatest concern. For sufficient property will be left to me even if I am defrauded of this sum; but if I should be thought to be laying claim to so large a sum of money without just cause, I should have an evil reputation as long as I live.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The greatest difficulty of all, men of the jury, is that I have adversaries of the character of the defendants here. For contracts with the managers of banks are entered into without witnesses, and any who are wronged by them are obliged to bring suit against men who have many friends, handle much money, and have a reputation for honesty because of their profession. In spite of these considerations I think I shall make it clear to all that I have been defrauded of my money by Pasion.

	I shall relate the facts to you from the beginning as well as I can. My father, men of the jury, is Sopaeus; all who sail to the Pontus know that his

	relations with Satyrus[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] are so intimate that he is ruler of an extensive territory and has charge of that ruler’s entire forces. Having heard reports both of this state and of the other lands where Greeks live, I desired to travel abroad. And so my father loaded two ships with grain,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] gave me money, and sent me off on a trading expedition and at the same time to see the world.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] Pythodorus, the Phoenician, introduced Pasion to me and I opened an account at his bank. Later on, as a result of slander which reached Satyrus to the effect that my father was plotting against the throne and that I was associating with the exiles, Satyrus arrested my father and sent orders to citizens of Pontus in residence here in Athens to take possession of my money and to bid me to return and, if I refused to obey, to demand of you my extradition. When I found myself in difficulties so embarrassing, men of the jury, I related my troubles to Pasion; for I was on such intimate terms with him that I had the greatest confidence in him, not only in matters of money, but in everything else as well. I thought that, if I should yield control of all my money, I should run the risk, in case my father met with misfortune, after having been deprived of my money both here in Athens and at home, of becoming utterly destitute; and that, if I should acknowledge the existence of money here, yet fail to surrender it at Satyrus’ command, I should create the most serious grounds of complaint against myself and my father in the mind of Satyrus.

	we decided that it would be best to agree to comply with all of Satyrus’ demands and to surrender the money whose existence was known, but with respect to the funds on deposit with Pasion we should not only deny their existence but also make it appear that I had borrowed at interest both from Pasion and from others,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and to do everything which was likely to make them believe that I had no money.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At that time, men of the jury, I thought that Pasion was giving me all this advice because of goodwill toward me; but when I had arranged matters with the representatives of Satyrus, I perceived that he had designs on my property. For when I wished to recover my money and sail to Byzantium, Pasion thought a most favourable opportunity had come his way; for the sum of money on deposit with him was large and of sufficient value to warrant a shameless act, and I, in the presence of many listeners, had denied that I possessed anything, and everybody had seen that money was being demanded of me and that I was acknowledging that I was indebted to others also. Besides this, men of the jury, he was of opinion that if I attempted to remain here, I should be handed over by Athens to Satyrus, and if I should go anywhere else, he would be indifferent to my complaints, and if I should sail to the Pontus, I should be put to death along with my father; it was on the strength of these calculations that Pasion decided to defraud me of my money. And although to me he pretended that for the moment he was short of funds and would not be able to repay me, yet when I, wishing to ascertain exactly the truth, sent Philomelus and Menexenus to him to demand

	my property, he denied to them that he had anything belonging to me. Thus beset on every side by misfortunes so dire, what, think you, was my state of mind? If I kept silent I should be defrauded of my money by Pasion here; if I should make this complaint, I was none the more likely to recover it and I should bring myself and my father into the greatest disrepute with Satyrus. The wisest course, therefore, as I thought, was to keep silent.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After this, men of the jury, messengers arrived with the news that my father had been released and that Satyrus was so repentant of all that had occurred that he had bestowed upon my father pledges of his confidence of the most sweeping kind, and had given him authority even greater than he formerly possessed and had chosen my sister as his son’s wife. When Pasion learned this and understood that I would now bring action openly about my property, he spirited away his slave Cittus, who had knowledge of our financial transactions. And when I went to him and demanded the surrender of Cittus, because I believed that this slave could furnish the clearest proof of my claim, Pasion made the most outrageous charge, that I and Menexenus had bribed and corrupted Cittus as he sat at his banking-table and received six talents of silver from him. And that there might be neither examination nor testimony under torture on these matters, he asserted that it was we who had spirited away the slave and had brought a counter-charge against himself with a demand that this slave, whom we ourselves had spirited away, be produced. And while he was making this plea and protesting and weeping, he dragged me before the Polemarch[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] with a demand

	Witnesses
	You have heard the witnesses, men of the jury; and I, who had already lost part of my money and with regard to the rest was under the most infamous charges, left Athens for the Peloponnesus to investigate for myself. But Menexenus found the slave here in the city, and having seized him demanded that he give testimony under torture[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] about both the deposit and the charge brought by his master. Pasion, however, reached such a pitch of audacity that he secured the release of the slave on the ground that he was a freeman and, utterly devoid of shame and of fear, he claimed as a freeman and prevented the torture of a person who, as he alleged, had been stolen from him by us and had given us all that money. But the crowning impudence of all was this—that when Menexenus compelled Pasion to give security for the slave before the Polemarch, he gave bond for him in the sum of seven talents.

Because of our disagreement the examiners refused to put the slave to torture themselves, but decreed that Pasion should surrender him to me.

	Two days later we met again and solemnly pledged each other to keep the affair secret, a pledge which he failed to keep, as you yourselves will learn as my story proceeds, and he agreed to sail with me to the Pontus and there pay me back the gold, in order that he might settle our contract at as great a distance as possible from Athens, and that no one here might know the nature of our settlement, and also that on his return from the Pontus he might say anything he pleased; but in the event that he should not fulfil these obligations, he proposed to entrust to Satyrus an arbitration on stated terms[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] which would permit Satyrus to condemn Pasion to pay the original sum, and half as much in addition. When he had drawn up this agreement in writing, we brought to the Acropolis Pyron, of Pherae,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] who frequently sailed to the Pontus, and placed the agreement in his custody, stipulating that if we should come to a satisfactory settlement with each other, he should burn the memorandum; otherwise, he was to deliver it to Satyrus.

	Menexenus was so enraged because of the charge which Pasion had brought against him also, that he brought an action for libel against him and demanded the surrender of Cittus, asking that Pasion, if guilty of falsification, should suffer the same penalty which he himself would have incurred for the same acts. And Pasion, men of the jury, begged me to appease Menexenus, saying it would be of no advantage to himself if, after having sailed to the Pontus, he should pay the money in accordance with the terms of the agreement, and then should all the same be made a laughing-stock in Athens; for the slave, if put to the torture, would testify to the truth of everything. I for my part, however, asked him to take any action he pleased as to Menexenus, but to carry out his agreements with me. At that time he was in a humble mood, for he did not know what to do in his plight. For not only was he in a state of fear in regard to the torture and the impending suit, but also with respect to the memorandum, lest Menexenus should obtain possession of it. And being embarrassed and finding no other means of relief, he bribed the slaves of the alien Pyron and falsified the memorandum which Satyrus was to receive in case he did not come to an agreement with me. No sooner had he accomplished this than he became the most impudent of all men and declared that he would not sail with me to the Pontus and that no contract at all existed between us, and he demanded that the memorandum be opened in the presence of witnesses. Why need I say more to you, men of the jury? For it was discovered to have been written in the memorandum that Pasion was released of all claims on my part!

	Well, all the facts in the case I have told you as accurately as I could. But I think, men of the jury, that Pasion will base his defence on the falsified memorandum, and will especially rely on its contents. Do you, therefore, give your attention to me; for I think that from these very contents I shall reveal to you his rascality.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Consider the matter first in this way. When we gave to the alien, Pyron, the agreement by which Pasion, as he claims, is released from my demands, but as I contend, I was to have received back the gold from him, we bade the alien, in case we arrived at an understanding with each other, to burn the memorandum; otherwise, to give it to Satyrus, and that this was stated both of us agree. And yet, men of the jury, what possessed us to stipulate that the memorandum should be given to Satyrus in case of our failure to come to terms, if Pasion had already been freed of my claims and our business had been concluded? On the contrary, it is clear that we had made this agreement because there yet remained matters which Pasion had to settle with me in accordance with the memorandum. In the next place, men of the jury, I can give you the reasons why he agreed to repay me the gold; for when we had been cleared of the false accusations lodged with Satyrus, and Pasion had been unable to spirit away Cittus, who had knowledge of my deposit, he understood that if he should deliver his slave to torture, he would be convicted of an act of rascality, and, on the other hand, if he failed to do so, he would lose his case[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; he wished, therefore,

	[m1]\ [/m]
	Furthermore, men of the jury, this too is easy for all to see—that whereas I, the plaintiff, if I distrusted the sufficiency of my proofs, could drop the prosecution even without entering into any agreement, yet Pasion, on account both of the examination of his slave under torture and the suits lodged with you, could not possibly free himself from his risks when he wished except by gaining the consent of me, the complainant. In consequence, I was not obliged to make an agreement about the dismissal of my charges, but it was necessary for him to do so about the repayment of my money. Besides, it would have been a preposterous state of affairs if, before the memorandum had been drawn up, I should have had so little confidence in my case as not only to drop the charges against Pasion, but also to make an agreement concerning these charges and, after I had drawn up such written proof against myself, should then have desired to bring the case before you. And yet who would plan so foolishly in regard to his own interests? But here is the strongest proof of all that in the agreement Pasion was not absolved from his debt, but on the contrary had agreed to repay the gold: when Menexenus lodged his suit against him, which was before the memorandum had been tampered with, Pasion sent Agyrrhius,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] a friend of both of us, to beg that I either appease Menexenus or annul the agreement

	I had made with himself. And yet, men of the jury, do you think that he would desire the annulment of this agreement, which he could use to convict us of falsehood? At any rate, this was not what he was saying after they had altered the memorandum; on the contrary, in all details he appealed to the agreement and ordered the memorandum to be opened. In proof that Pasion at first was eager for the suppression of the agreement I will produce Agyrrhius himself as witness.

	So then, the fact that we made the agreement, not as Pasion will try to explain, but as I have related to you, I think has been sufficiently established. And it should not occasion surprise, men of the jury, that he falsified the memorandum, not only for the reason that there have been numerous frauds of such nature, but because some of Pasion’s friends have been guilty of conduct far worse. For instance, is there anyone who is ignorant that Pythodorus, called the “shopkeeper,”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] whose words and acts are all in Pasion’s interest, last year opened the voting-urns[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and removed the ballots naming the judges which had been cast by the Council?

Now, men of the jury, when Stratocles was about to sail for Pontus, I, wishing to get as much of my money out of that country as possible, asked Stratocles to leave with me his own gold and on his arrival in Pontus to collect its equivalent from my father there, as I thought it would be highly advantageous not to jeopardize my money by the risks of a voyage, especially as the Lacedaemonians were then masters of the sea. For Pasion, then, I do not think that this is any indication that I had no money here; but for me my dealings with Stratocles will constitute the strongest proof that I had gold on deposit with Pasion. For when Stratocles inquired of me who would repay him in case my father failed to carry out my written instructions, and if, on his return, he should not find me here, I introduced Pasion to him, and Pasion himself agreed to repay him both the principal and

	Perhaps, men of the jury, he will present witnesses to you who will testify that I also denied, in the presence of the agents of Satyrus, that I possessed any money except that which I surrendered to them, and that he himself was laying claim to my money on my own confession that I owed him three hundred drachmas, and also that I had allowed Hippolaïdas, my guest and friend, to borrow from him.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] As for me, men of the jury, since I was involved in the difficulties which I have related to you, deprived of all I had at home and under compulsion to surrender what I had here to the envoys from Pontus, and finding myself without any means unless I could secretly retain in my possession the money on deposit with Pasion, I did, I admit, acknowledge a debt due him of three hundred drachmas and that in other respects I behaved and spoke in a manner which I thought would best persuade them that I possessed nothing. And that these things were done by me, not because of lack of funds, but that the parties in Pontus might believe that to be the case, you will readily learn. I will present to you first those who knew that I had received much money from Pontus; next, those who saw me as a patron of Pasion’s bank, and, besides, the persons from whom

In addition to this, when a special tax was imposed upon us and other men than I were appointed registrars, I contributed more than any other foreigner; and when I was myself chosen registrar, I subscribed the largest contribution, but I pleaded with my fellow-registrars on behalf of Pasion, explaining that it was my money that he was using.

	Pasion himself, moreover—in effect, at least—I will present as corroborating these statements. An information had been laid by a certain party against a trading-ship, upon which I had lent a large sum of money, as belonging to a man of Delos.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] When I disputed this claim and demanded that the ship put to sea, those who make a business of blackmail so influenced the Council that at first I almost was put to death without a trial; finally, however, they were persuaded to accept bondsmen from me. And Philip, who was my father’s guest-friend, was summoned and appeared, but took to flight in alarm at the magnitude of the danger; Pasion, however, furnished for me Archestratus,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] the banker, as surety for seven talents. And yet if he stood to lose but a small sum and had known that I possessed no funds here, surely he would not have become my surety for so large an amount. But it is obvious that Pasion called in the three hundred drachmas as a favour to me, and that he became my surety for seven talents because he judged that the gold on deposit with him was a

	[m1]\ [/m]
	It seems to me, men of the jury, that you would best decide upon the questions at issue if you should call to mind that period and the situation in which our affairs stood when I sent Menexenus and Philomelus to claim the deposit and Pasion for the first time had the hardihood to deny its existence. You will find, in fact, that my father had been arrested and deprived of all his property, and that I was unable, because of the embarrassment in which I found myself, either to remain here or to sail to the Pontus. And yet, which is the more reasonable supposition—that I, involved in misfortunes so great brought unjust charges against Pasion or that he, because of the magnitude of our misfortunes and the large sum of money involved, was tempted to defraud us? But what man ever went so far in chicanery as, with his own life in jeopardy, to plot against the possessions of others?[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] With what hope or with what intent would I have unjustly proceeded against Pasion? Was it my thought that, in fear of my influence, he would forthwith give me money? But neither the one nor the other of us was in such a situation. Or was I of opinion that by bringing the matter to issue in court I should have greater influence with you than Pasion, even contrary to justice—I, who was not even preparing to remain in Athens, since I feared that Satyrus would demand of you my extradition? Or was I going to act so that, without accomplishing anything, I should

	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is also right, men of the jury, that you should note the absurdity and the incredibility of the arguments which Pasion on each occasion undertook to present. For when my situation was. such that, even if he acknowledged that he was defrauding me of my money, I could not have exacted the penalty from him, it is then that he accuses me of trying to make unjust claims; but when I had been declared innocent of the slanderous charges lodged with Satyrus and all thought that he would lose his suit, it is then that he says I renounced all claims against him. And yet how could anything be more illogical than this?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But, you may say, perhaps it is on these matters only, and not on the others, that he obviously contradicts himself in both words and deeds. Yet he is the man who, though he alleged that the slave whom he himself had spirited away had been enslaved by us, yet listed this same person in his property-schedule as a slave along with his other servants, and then when Menexenus demanded that this slave give testimony under torture, Pasion brought about his release on the ground that he was a freeman! Furthermore, while he himself was defrauding me of my deposit, he had the impudence to accuse us of having six talents from his bank. And yet when a man did not hesitate to lie in matters so obvious to everybody, how can he be believed about matters transacted between us two alone?

On his arrival Cittus alleged that he was a freeman, a Milesian by birth, and that Pasion had sent him to furnish information about the money. When Satyrus had heard us both, he did not wish to render a decision concerning contracts made in Athens, especially since Pasion was absent and not likely to comply with his decision; but he believed so strongly that I was being wronged that he called together the shipowners[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and asked them to assist me and not suffer me to be wronged.

	Although, men of the jury, my claims to justice are so many, I think that the strongest proof that Pasion defrauded me of my money is this—that he refused to surrender for torture the slave who knew about the deposit.

For witnesses certainly we do not use in contracts with banks.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] I see that in private and public causes you judge that nothing is more deserving of belief, or truer, than testimony given under torture, and that while you think it possible to suborn witnesses even for acts which

	never occurred at all, yet that testimony under torture clearly shows which party is telling the truth.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Pasion, being aware of this, wished that in this affair you should judge by conjecture rather than know the exact truth. For he certainly would not be able to say that he was likely to be at a disadvantage if torture should be used and that for this reason the surrender of his slave could not reasonably be expected of him. For you all know that if Cittus spoke against his master, he would likely suffer for the remainder of his life in the most cruel manner at the hands of his master, but that if he held firm in his denials, he would be free and have a share of my money which his master had taken. In spite of the fact that he was to have so great an advantage Pasion, conscious of his guilty deeds, submitted to stand suit and to rest under the other charges, all to prevent any testimony under torture being given in this case!
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I therefore ask of you that, keeping these facts in mind, you cast your votes against Pasion and not judge me guilty of a villainy so great, that I, who live in Pontus and possess so large an estate that I am able even to assist others, have come here maliciously to prosecute Pasion and to accuse him of dishonesty in the matter of a deposit made with his bank.

	[c darkmagenta][b]ISOCRATES, Discourses 18. Against Callimachus[/b][/c]
	[b]Against Callimachus[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	Isocrates wrote this forensic speech for a client who was defending himself against an Action for Damages brought by a person named Callimachus. The defendant in reply entered a Special Plea of Exception, or Demurrer, denying the admissibility of the suit. In a case of this kind the positions of plaintiff and defendant were reversed, so that the defendant, contrary to the usual procedure, spoke first.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The facts of the case, related in the speech, are briefly as follows: Patrocles, Archon Basileus (King-Archon) of Athens in 403 b.c. during the brief period when the Ten held power in succession to the Thirty Tyrants, denounced Callimachus for illegally having in his possession a sum of money which belonged to one of the exiled members of the democratic party who had assembled at Piraeus. The case was referred by the Ten to the Council, which decreed that the money should be confiscated. After the citizens at Piraeus had been restored to power in Athens, Callimachus brought successful actions against several defendants: Patrocles was compelled to pay ten minas[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; one Lysimachus two minas; and the defendant compromised the case by the payment of two minas. This last payment was sanctioned by an arbitrator, which action estopped further litigation.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c][c dimgray]Imina[/c] = 100 drachmae, about $18 or £4.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 252[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Against Callimachus[/b]
	In spite of this, Callimachus again brought suit for one hundred minas, whereupon the defendant produced a witness of the previous arbitration. Callimachus, after an interval, brought a new action. The client of Isocrates then appealed to the new law of Archinus. This was a law which Archinus, in an endeavour to bring to an end civic discord and enmities in accordance with the spirit and the terms of the general amnesty which had been declared following the restoration of the democracy, had succeeded in having passed. The law provided that when an action was brought in violation of the Amnesty, the defendant could enter an Exception or Special Plea and this Special Plea should precede a regular trial; further, if either party failed to receive one-fifth of the votes of the tribunal, he was liable to the fine of one-sixth of the sum in litigation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This case occurred soon after the Amnesty of 403 b.c. The trial, for which this speech was written, may be assigned with probability to the year 402 b.c. and early in the career of Isocrates.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The plainness and simplicity of the style of the speech and the detailed argumentation, which reminds the student of the Attic orator Isaeus, are in keeping with the subject, the occasion, and the speaker.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	[b]XVIII. Special Plea Against Callimachus[/b]
	If any others had employed in litigation such a special plea of exception, I should have begun my discourse with the facts themselves; but as the situation is, I am compelled first to speak of the law in accordance with which we have come before the court, that you may cast your votes with an understanding of the issues in our dispute and that no one of you may be surprised that I, although defendant in the case, am speaking prior to the plaintiff.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now after your return to the city from Piraeus,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] you saw that some of the citizens were bent upon bringing malicious prosecutions and were attempting to violate the Amnesty[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; so, wishing to restrain these persons and to show to all others that you had not made these agreements under compulsion, but because you thought them of advantage to the city, you enacted a law, on the motion of Archinus, to the effect that, if any person should commence a lawsuit in violation of the oaths, the defendant should have the power to enter a plea of exception, the magistrates should first submit this question to the tribunal, and that the defendant who had entered the plea should speak first; and further, that the loser should pay a penalty of one-sixth of the sum at stake. The purpose of the penalty was this—that persons who

	had the effrontery to rake up old grudges should not only be convicted of perjury but also, not awaiting the vengeance of the gods, should suffer immediate punishment. I thought, therefore, that it was absurd if, under the existing laws, I was to permit my calumniator to risk only thirty drachmas, while I myself am contesting a suit in which my whole property is at stake.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I intend to prove that Callimachus not only is bringing a suit in violation of the terms of the Amnesty agreement, but that he is also guilty of falsehood in his charges, and furthermore, that we have already resorted to arbitration in the matter at issue. But I wish to relate the facts to you from the beginning; for if you learn that he has suffered no wrong at my hands, I think that you will be more inclined to defend the Amnesty and be more incensed with him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The government of the Ten, who had succeeded the Thirty, was then in control when Patrocles, a friend of mine, was the King-Archon,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and with him one day I happened to be walking. Patrocles, an enemy of Callimachus who is now prosecuting me in this suit, met him as he was carrying a sum of money, laid hold of him, and claimed that this money had been left by Pamphilus and belonged to the government; for Pamphilus was a member of the party of the Piraeus.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Callimachus denied this and as a violent quarrel ensued many others came running up; among them by chance Rhinon, who had become one of the Ten, approached. So Patrocles immediately laid information with him concerning the money and Rhinon led them both before his colleagues.

	and the conduct of certain criminal processes.

	These officials referred the matter to the Council[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; after an adjudication, the money was declared the property of the state. Later, after the return of the citizen-exiles from Piraeus, Callimachus brought a charge against Patrocles and instituted proceedings against him on the ground that he was responsible for his loss. And when he had effected with him a settlement of the matter and had exacted from him ten minas of silver, Callimachus maliciously accused Lysimachus. Having obtained two hundred drachmas from him, he began to make trouble for me. At first he charged me with being the accomplice of the others; in the end, he came to such a pitch of impudence that he accused me as responsible for everything that had been done, and it may be that even now he will have the effrontery to make just such an accusation. In rebuttal, however, I will present to you as witnesses, first, those who were present at the beginning of the affair, who will testify that I did not arrest Callimachus nor did I touch the money; second, Rhinon and his colleagues, who will tell you that it was Patrocles, and not I, who denounced him to them; and finally, the members of the Council, who will attest that Patrocles was the accuser.

And some of his friends came to me and advised me to settle the dispute with him, and not deliberately to risk defamation and great financial loss, even though I had the greatest confidence in my cause; and they went on to say that many decisions rendered in the tribunals were contrary to the expectation of litigants, and that chance rather than justice determined the issue in your courts. Consequently, they asserted, it was in my interest to be freed of serious charges by paying a petty sum, rather than by paying nothing to run the risk of penalties of such gravity. Why need I relate to you all the details? They omitted none of the arguments which are customarily urged in such cases. In any case I was finally prevailed upon (for I will tell you the whole truth) to give him two hundred drachmas. But in order that it might not be in his power to blackmail me again, we committed the arbitration under stated terms[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] to Nicomachus of Batê. . . .[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	court by reason of the previous arbitration, he did not attack my witness—for he knew that, if he did not receive the fifth of the votes cast, he would be assessed a penalty of one-sixth of the amount demanded—but having won over the magistrate, he again brought the same suit, in the belief that he risked only his court deposit-fee. And since I was at a loss how to cope with my difficulties, I judged that it was best to make the hazard equal for us both[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and to come before you. And these are the facts.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I learn that Callimachus not only intends to speak falsely in the matter of his complaint, but will also deny that the arbitration took place, and that he is prepared to go so far as to assert that he never would have entrusted an arbitration to Nicomachus, whom he knew to be an old friend of ours, and further, that it is improbable that he was willing to accept two hundred drachmas instead of ten thousand. You must reflect, however, first, that we were not in dispute in the matter of the arbitration, but we committed it as an arbitration under stated terms, so that it is not at all strange that Callimachus chose Nicomachus as arbiter; it would have been far stranger if, after he had come to an agreement about the matter, he had then made difficulty about the choice of arbiter. In the next place, it is not reasonable to assume that, if ten thousand drachmas had been owing to him, he would have settled for two minas[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; but since his charges were unjust and in the nature of blackmail, it is not astonishing that he was willing to take so little. Furthermore, if, after exorbitant demands, he exacted little, this is no proof in favour of his contention that the arbitration did not take place; on the contrary, it confirms

	all the more our contention that his claim was unjust in the first place. I am astonished that, while he judges himself capable of recognizing that it was not probable that he was willing to take two hundred drachmas instead of the ten thousand, yet believes that I am incapable of discovering, if I had wished to lie, that I ought to have asserted that I had given him more. But this I ask—that in so far as it would have been an indication in his favour that the arbitration did not take place, if he had proved the falsity of the testimony, to that same extent it shall be proof in favour of my contention that I tell the truth concerning the arbitration, inasmuch as it is clearly shown that he did not dare to proceed against my witness.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I think, however, that even if there had been neither arbitration nor witnesses to the actual facts and you were under the necessity of considering the case in the light of the probabilities, not even in this event would you have difficulty in arriving at a just verdict. For if I were so audacious a man as to wrong others, you would with good reason condemn me as doing wrong to him also; but as it is, I shall be found innocent of having harmed any citizen in regard to his property, or of jeopardizing his life, or of having expunged his name from the list of active citizens, or of having inscribed his name on Lysander’s list.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] And yet the wickedness of the Thirty[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] impelled many to act in this way; for they not only did not punish the evil-doers but they even commanded some persons to do wrong. So as for me, not even when they had control of the government, shall I be found guilty of any such misdeed; yet Callimachus says that he was wronged after the

	Thirty had been expelled, the Piraeus had been taken, and when the democracy was in power, and the terms of reconciliation were being discussed. And yet do you think that a man who was well-behaved under the Thirty put off his wrongdoing until that period when even those who had formerly transgressed were repentant? But the most absurd thing of all would be this—that although I never saw fit to avenge myself on anyone of my existing enemies, I was attempting to injure this man with whom I have never had any business dealings at all!

	That I am not responsible for the confiscation of the money of Callimachus I think I have sufficiently proved.

	is so convinced of his own eloquence that he believes he will persuade you to vote in opposition to them? If he saw that the city regretted its past action, his conduct should not occasion surprise; but as a matter of fact you have shown the importance you attach to the covenant, not only in the enactment of the laws, but when Philon of Coelê was indicted for malversation on an embassy, and although he could offer no defence but merely cited the covenant in exoneration, you decided to dismiss his case and not even hold him for trial. And although the city does not think it proper to punish even confessed transgressors, yet this man has the effrontery to bring malicious charges against those who have done no wrong at all. Furthermore, he is certainly not unaware of this either—that Thrasybulus and Anytus, men of the greatest influence in the city, although they have been robbed of large sums or money and know who gave in lists of their goods, nevertheless are not so brazen as to bring suit against them or to bring up old grudges against them; on the contrary, even if, in respect to all other claims, they have greater power than others to accomplish their ends, yet in matters covered by the covenant at least they see fit to put themselves on terms of equality with the other citizens. And it is not these men alone who have accepted this point of view; no, not even one of you has dared to bring such an action. And yet it would be outrageous if you, while honouring your oaths where your own affairs are concerned, shall attempt to violate them in connexion with the calumnious charges of Callimachus, and if, while insisting that private agreements must be held valid by public authority, shall allow anyone who so

And although you were incensed with those who have said that the covenant of Amnesty should be repealed, yet this man, who has the effrontery to transgress it after its official promulgation, you are going to discharge without a penalty! No, should you do so, you would neither be rendering justice nor acting in a manner worthy of yourselves or consistent with your former decisions.

	I beg you, however, to bear in mind that you have come to pass judgement on matters of the highest importance; for you are going to cast your votes on the question of a covenant, and covenants have never been violated to the advantage of either yourselves in relation to the other parties or of others in relation to you; and they have such binding force that almost all the daily activities of Greeks and of barbarians are governed by covenants. For it is through our reliance on them that we visit one another’s lands and procure those things of which we both have need; with the aid of these we make our contracts with each other and put an end to both our private animosities and our common wars.

	It is your duty, I say, for recently, when we had been conquered and had fallen into the power of enemies at home and many wished to destroy the city, we took refuge in the oaths and covenants; and if the Lacedaemonians should dare to violate these, every man of you would be exceedingly indignant. And yet how can one accuse the other party of transgressions of which he is himself guilty? Who would regard us as victims of injustice when suffering injury through a violation of covenants, if even we ourselves were manifestly holding them in slight esteem? What pledges shall we find binding in our relations with other peoples if we so lightly disregard those which we have made among ourselves? This, too, is worthy of our remembrance that, although our forefathers performed many glorious deeds in war, yet not the least of its glory our city has won through these treaties of reconciliation. For whereas many cities might be found which have waged war gloriously, in dealing with civil discord there is none which could be shown to have taken wiser measures than ours. Furthermore, the great majority of all those achievements that have been accomplished by fighting may be attributed to Fortune; but for the moderation we showed towards one another no one could find any other cause than our good judgement. Consequently it is not fitting that we should prove false to this glorious reputation.

	not merely with the sum of money specified in the indictment; for me, it is true, this is the issue, but for you it is that of which I have just spoken; and on this subject no one would be able to speak in fitting fashion nor could he fix an adequate penalty. For this law-suit differs so greatly from other private suits in this respect that, while the latter are of concern to the litigants only, in this private law-suit the common interests of the city are likewise at stake. In trying this case you are bound by two oaths: one is the customary judicial oath which you take in all ordinary cases, and the other is that oath which you swore when you ratified the covenant of Amnesty. If you render an unjust verdict in this case, you will be violating not only the laws of the city, but also the laws common to all men. Consequently, it is not fitting that your votes should be based upon favour, or upon mere equity, nor upon anything else than upon the oaths you took when you made the covenant of Amnesty.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now that it is right, and is expedient and just that you should decide thus concerning the covenant of Amnesty not even Callimachus himself, I think, will gainsay; but he intends, I suppose, to bewail his present poverty and the misfortune which has befallen him, and to say that his fate will be dreadful and cruel if now under the democracy he must pay the assessed fine for the money of which under the oligarchy he was deprived,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and also if then because he possessed property he was forced to go into exile, yet now, at a time when he ought to get satisfaction for wrongs done him, he is to be deprived of his civic rights.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] And he will accuse also those who took part in the revolution, in the hope that in this way especially

	were laid.

	he will arouse you to wrath; for perhaps he has heard it said that whenever you fail to apprehend the guilty, you punish any who cross your path. But I for my part do not think that you are so disposed, and I believe that it is easy to controvert the pleas just suggested. As for his lamentations, it is fitting that you give aid, not to those who try to show that they are the most miserable of men, but to those whose statements concerning the facts to which they have sworn in their affidavits are manifestly the more just. And in regard to the penalty assessed against the loser, if I were responsible for this action, you might reasonably sympathize with him as about to be penalized; but the truth is, it is he who brings in a calumnious accusation and therefore you cannot in justice accept anything he says. In the second place, you should consider this point—that all the exiles who returned to the city from the Peiraeus would be able to use the very same arguments as he; but no one except Callimachus has had the audacity to introduce such a suit. And yet you ought to hate such persons and regard them as bad citizens who, although they have suffered the same misfortunes as the party of the people, think fit to exact exceptional punishments. Furthermore, it is possible for him even now, before he has made trial of your decision, to drop the suit and to be entirely rid of all his troubles. And yet is it not stupid of him to seek to win your pity while in this jeopardy, for which he himself is responsible, and in which he has involved himself, a jeopardy which even now it is possible for him to avoid? And if he does mention events which occurred under the oligarchy, demand of him that, instead of accusing persons whom no

	one will defend,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] he prove that it was I who took his money; for this is the issue upon which you must cast your votes. And demand that he, instead of showing that he has suffered cruel wrongs, prove that it is I who have committed them, I, from whom he seeks to recover what he has lost; since the fact of his evil plight he can readily establish in a suit brought against any other citizen whatever. And yet the accusations which should have great weight with you are not those which may be made even against those who are entirely guiltless, but those only which cannot be brought against any persons except those who have committed an act of injustice. To these allegations, this will perhaps be a sufficient reply and a further rebuttal soon will be possible.

	Also bear in mind, I ask you—even though I may be thought by someone to be repeating myself—that many persons are attentively watching the outcome of this case; not because they are interested in our affairs, but because they believe that the covenant of Amnesty is on trial. Such persons, if your decision is just, you will enable to dwell in the city without fear; otherwise, how do you expect those who remained in the city to feel, if you show that you are angry with all alike who obtained the rights of citizenship? And what will those think who are conscious of even slight error on their part, when they see that not even persons whose conduct as citizens has been decent obtain justice?

May we not rightly fear that, once your oaths have been violated, we shall again be brought to the same state of affairs which compelled us to make the covenant of Amnesty? Certainly you do not need to learn from others how great is the blessing of concord or how great a curse is civil war; for you have experienced both in so extreme a form that you yourselves would be best qualified to instruct all others regarding them.

	But lest it be thought that the reason I am dwelling long on the covenant of Amnesty is merely because it is easy when speaking on that subject to make many just observations, I urge you to remember when you cast your votes only one thing more—that before we entered into those agreements we Athenians were in a state of war, some of us occupying the circle enclosed by the city’s walls, others Piraeus after we had captured it,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and we hated each other more than we did the enemies bequeathed to us by our ancestors. But after we came together and exchanged the solemn pledges, we have lived so uprightly and so like citizens of one country that it seemed as if no misfortune had ever befallen us. At that time all looked upon us as the most foolish and ill-fated of mankind; now, however, we are regarded as the happiest and wisest of the Greeks. Therefore it is incumbent upon us to inflict upon those who dare to violate the covenant, not merely the heavy penalties prescribed by the treaty, but the most extreme, on the ground that these persons are the cause of the greatest evils, especially those who have lived as Callimachus has

For during the ten years[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] when the Lacedaemonians warred upon you uninterruptedly, not for one single day’s service did he present himself to the generals; on the contrary, all through that period he continued to evade service and to keep his property in concealment. But when the Thirty came to power, then it was that he sailed back to Athens. And although he professes to be a friend of the people, yet he was so much more eager than anybody else to participate in the oligarchical government that, even though it meant hardship, he saw fit not to depart, but preferred to be besieged in company with those who had injured him rather than to live as a citizen with you, who likewise had been wronged by them. And he remained as a participant in their government until that day on which you were on the point of attacking the walls of Athens; then he left the city, not because he had come to hate the present regime, but because he was afraid of the danger which threatened, as he later made evident. For when the Lacedaemonians came and the democracy was shut up in the Piraeus,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] again he fled from there and resided among the Boeotians; it is far more fitting, therefore, that his name should be enrolled in the list of the deserters than that he should be called one of the “exiles.” And although he has proved to be a man of such character by his conduct toward the people who occupied the Piraeus, toward those who remained in the city, and toward the whole state, he is not content to be on equal terms with the others, but seeks to be treated better than you, as if either he alone had suffered injury, or was the best of the citizens, or had met with the

The fact is, though, that if I should try to tell of all the others who have been the objects of his plots, of the private law-suits in which he has been involved, of the public suits which he has entered, of the persons with whom he has conspired or against whom he has borne false witness, not even twice as much water[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] as has been allotted me would prove sufficient.

	Cratinus once had a dispute over a farm with the brother-in-law of Callimachus. A personal encounter ensued. Having concealed a female slave, they accused Cratinus of having crushed her head, and asserting that she had died as a result of the wound, they brought suit against him in the court of the Palladium[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] on the charge of murder. Cratinus, learning of their plots, remained quiet for a long time in order that they might not change their plans and concoct another story, but instead might be caught in the very act of committing a crime. When the brother-in-law of Callimachus had made accusation and Callimachus had testified on oath that the woman was actually dead, Cratinus and his friends

	Who, therefore, would be able to condemn his acts as they deserve? Or who would be able to find a more flagrant example of wrongdoing, of malicious prosecution, and of villainy? Some misdeeds, it is true, do not reveal in its entirety the character of the evil-doers, but from acts such as his it is easy to discern the whole life of the culprits. For any man who testifies that the living are dead, from what villainy do you think that he would abstain? What outrageous deed would a man not have the effrontery to commit in his own interest who is so knavish a villain in the interest of others? How is it right to trust this man when he speaks in his own behalf, who is proved guilty of perjury in his testimony on behalf of another? Who was ever more convincingly proved to be a giver of false testimony? You judge all other defendants by what is said of them, but this man’s testimony the jurors themselves saw was false. And after the commission of such crimes he will dare to say that it is we who are lying. Why that would be as if Phrynondas[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] should reproach a

	But against Callimachus it will be possible to bring accusations time and again, for he has contrived his life as a citizen that way; but as for myself, I shall say nothing of all my other contributions to the state, but I will merely remind you of that one, a service for which, if you would do me justice, you would not only be grateful, but you would take it even as evidence bearing upon the case as a whole. Now when the city had lost its ships in the Hellespont[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and was shorn of its power, I so far surpassed the majority of the trierarchs that I was one of the very few who saved their ships: and of these few I alone brought back my ship to the Piraeus and did not resign my duties as trierarch; but when the other trierarchs were glad to be relieved of their duties and were discouraged over the situation, and not only regretted the loss of what they had already spent, but were trying to conceal the remainder and, judging that the commonwealth was completely ruined, were looking out for their private interests, my decision was not the same as theirs; but after persuading my brother to be joint-trierarch with me, we paid the crew out of our own means and proceeded to harass the enemy.

In recognition of these services you voted that we should be honoured with crowns, and that in front of the statues of the eponymous heroes[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] we should be proclaimed as the authors of great blessings. Yet surely men who should now be regarded as friends of the people are not those who, when the people were in power, were eager to participate in affairs, but those who, when the state was suffering misfortune, were willing to brave the first dangers in your behalf, and gratitude is due, not to him who has suffered personal hardships, but to him who has conferred benefits upon you; and in the case of those who have become poor, pity should be felt, not for those who have lost their property, but for those who have spent their fortune for your good. Of these last named it will be found that I have been one; and I should be the most miserable of all men, if, after I have spent much of my fortune for the good of the city, it should be thought that I plot against the property of others, and that I care naught for your poor opinion of me; when it is obvious that I set less store, not merely on my property, but even on my life, than on your good opinion.

And who would not reproach you, if, cajoled by the words of Callimachus, you should find me guilty of such baseness, you who, when you judged us on the strength of our deeds, crowned us for our bravery at a time when it was not so easy as it is now to win that honour?

	It has come to pass that our appeal is the opposite of that which other litigants generally make; for everybody else reminds the recipients of the benefactions they have received, whereas we ask you, the donors, to bear your gifts in mind, that they may serve you as corroboration of all I have said and of our principles of conduct. And it is evident that we showed ourselves worthy of this honour, not for the purpose of plundering the property of others after the oligarchy had been established, but in order that, after the city had been saved, not only all the citizens might keep their own possessions, but also that in the hearts of our fellow-citizens at large there might be a feeling of gratitude to us as a debt to be paid. It is this that we beg of you now, not seeking to have more than is just, but offering proof that we are guilty of no wrongdoing and asking you to abide by the oaths and the covenant of Amnesty. For it would be outrageous if those covenants should be held valid for the exculpation of the evil-doers, but should be made invalid for us, your benefactors! And it is prudent for you to guard well your present

	[b]Aegineticus[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The speech called [c dimgray]Aegineticus[/c] is a [c dimgray]Claim to an Inheritance[/c] (ἐπιδικασία) and is probably the best of the six forensic speeches written by Isocrates in the first period of his literary activity (403–393 b.c.) when he practised the profession of a [c dimgray]logographos[/c], or writer of speeches for litigants.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Thrasylochus, a citizen of the little island of Siphnos in the Aegean Sea, had at his death bequeathed his property to the speaker, his adopted son, to whom he also gave his sister as wife. A half-sister of Thrasylochus disputed the right of the speaker to receive the estate and herself laid claim to the inheritance. This discourse, composed by Isocrates, is the defence of the heir.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The speaker and Thrasylochus, political exiles from their island Siphnos, had settled at Aegina, where the testator died. At Aegina the case was tried; in fact, this is the only extant Greek forensic speech which is concerned with a law-suit outside of Attica.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The speech is composed with great care and may be regarded as a model of its kind. The narrative part of the discourse, in which the history of the family is given, is vividly presented and the defendant’s relations with the testator and his devotion to him are attested by convincing proofs. Cogent arguments are employed to persuade the Aeginetan jury
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Page number 298[/c]
	[m1]\ [/m][b]Aegineticus[/b]
	that the will of Thrasylochus and the claims of the speaker are entirely justified on the basis of law, morality, and religion.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Although the exact date[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of the speech is uncertain, it must be not long after 394 b.c., when the power of Sparta, supporter of oligarchies in the Cyclades, was overthrown at Cnidus. This is shown by the facts of the speech related in §§ 18–20; the aristocrats of Siphnos (including Thrasylochus and the speaker) were driven from their island by democratic exiles.

	I was of opinion, citizens of Aegina, that Thrasylochus had arranged his affairs so prudently that no one would ever come before a court to bring a suit in opposition to the will which he left. But since my adversaries have determined to contest a testament so purposefully drawn, I am compelled to try to obtain my rights from you. My feeling is unlike that of most men. For I see that others are indignant when they are unjustly involved in a law-suit, whereas I am almost grateful to my opponents for bringing me into this trial.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] For if the matter had not been brought before a tribunal you would not have known of my devotion to the deceased, which led to my being made his heir; but when you learn the facts you will all perceive that I might justly have been thought worthy of even a greater reward. The proper course, however, for the woman who is laying claim to the property would have been, not to try to obtain from you the estate left by Thrasylochus, but to show that she also was devoted to him and on that ground thought fit to bring suit for it. But the truth is, she is so far from repenting of her misconduct towards Thrasylochus in his life-time, that now too that he is dead she is trying to annul his

And I am astonished that those who are acting in her behalf think this action is reputable, just because, if they fail to win, they will need to pay no penalty. For my part, I think that it will be a severe penalty, if, having been convicted of making a wrongful claim, they shall thereafter suffer in your esteem. However, you will know the baseness of these men from their very acts when you have heard to the end what they have done; and I shall begin the recital of them at the point from which, in my opinion, you will be able to learn most quickly the matters at issue.

	Thrasyllus, the father of the testator, had inherited nothing from his parents; but having become the guest-friend of Polemaenetus, the soothsayer, he became so intimate with him that Polemaenetus at his death left to him his books on divination and gave him a portion of the property which is now in question. Thrasyllus, with these books as his capital, practised the art of divination. He became an itinerant soothsayer, lived in many cities, and was intimate with several women, some of whom had children whom he never even recognized as legitimate, and, in particular, during this period he lived with the mother of the complainant. When he had acquired a large fortune and yearned for his fatherland, he left this woman and the others as well, and debarking at Siphnos married a sister of my father. Thrasyllus himself was indeed the leading citizen in wealth, but he knew that our family was likewise pre-eminent in lineage and in general standing; and he cherished so warmly my father’s affection for him that at the death of his wife, who was without children, he remarried, taking as wife my father’s

After this he married a woman of Seriphos, belonging to a family of greater consequence than might be expected of a native of their island.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Of this marriage were born Sopolis, Thrasylochus, and a daughter, who is my wife. These were the only legitimate children left by Thrasyllus and he made these his heirs when he died.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Thrasylochus and I, having inherited from our fathers a friendship the intimacy of which I have recently mentioned, made the bond still closer. For during our childhood we were fonder of each other than of our brothers, and we would perform no sacrifice, make no pilgrimage, and celebrate no festival except in one another’s company; and when we reached manhood we never opposed one another in any action undertaken, for we not only shared our private concerns but also held similar sentiments regarding public affairs, and we had the same intimates and guest-friends. And why need I speak further of our intimacy at home?[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] In truth, not even in exile did we care to be apart. Finally, when Thrasylochus was striken with the wasting disease and suffered a long illness—his brother Sopolis had previously died[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and his mother and sister had not yet arrived[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c]—seeing him so completely destitute of companionship I nursed him with such unremitting care and devotion that he thought he could never

	Law
	It was in accordance with this law, citizens of Aegina, that Thrasylochus adopted me as his son, for I was his fellow-citizen and friend, in birth inferior to no one of the Siphnians, and had been reared and educated very much as he himself had been.

	Law
	What argument is left to them, therefore, since they themselves admit that Thrasylochus left the will and that they can cite no law in their favour, whereas all support my case—first, the law which is valid among you who are to adjudge the case, next, the law of Siphnos, the fatherland of the testator, and finally the law of the country of my opponents? And yet from what illegal act do you think these persons would abstain, inasmuch as they seek to persuade you that you should declare this will invalid, although the laws read as you have heard and you have taken oath to cast your votes in conformity with them?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	On the issue itself I consider that I have adduced sufficient proof; but that no one may think that my possession of the inheritance rests upon feeble grounds, or that this woman had been kindly in her behaviour toward Thrasylochus and is being defrauded of his fortune, I wish also to discuss these matters. For I should be ashamed in behalf of the deceased unless you were all convinced that his actions were strictly in accordance, not only with the law, but also with justice. And I believe that proof of this is easy. There was, in truth, this great difference between us—that this woman, who bases her contention on the ground of relationship, never ceased to be at variance with the testator and evilly-disposed toward him and toward Sopolis and their mother, whereas I shall be shown to have been the most deserving of all his friends, not only in my relations with Thrasylochus and his brother, but also with regard to the estate in controversy.

	It would be a long story to tell of the events of long ago; but when Pasinus[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] took Paros, it chanced that my friends had the greatest part of their fortune deposited as a pledge with my guest-friends there; for we thought that this island was by far the safest. When they were at their wits’ end and believed that their property was lost, I sailed thither by night and got their money out at the risk of my life; for the country was occupied by a garrison, and some of the exiles from our island had participated in the seizure of the city, and these, in one day and with their own hands, had slain my father, my uncle, my brother-in-law and, in addition, three cousins. However, I was deterred by none of these risks, but I took ship, thinking I ought to run the risk as much for my friends’ sake as for my own. Afterwards when a general flight from the city[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] ensued, accompanied by such confusion and fear that some persons were indifferent even to the fate of their own relations, I was not content, even in these misfortunes, merely to be able to save the members of my own household, but knowing that Sopolis was absent and Thrasylochus was in feeble health, I helped him to convey from the country his mother, his sister, and all his fortune. And yet who with greater justice should possess this fortune than the person who then helped to save it and now has received it from its legitimate owners?

	I have related the adventures in which I incurred danger indeed, yet suffered no harm; but I have also to speak of friendly services I rendered him which involved me in the greatest misfortunes. For when we had arrived at Melos, and Thrasylochus

And although my mother was afraid because she had heard that Troezen was unhealthy and our guest-friends advised us to remain where we were, nevertheless we decided that we ought to gratify his wish. No sooner had we arrived at Troezen than we were attacked by illnesses of such severity that I barely escaped with my own life, and within thirty days I buried my young sister, fourteen years of age, and my mother not five days thereafter. In what state of mind do you think I was after such a change in my life? I had previously been inexperienced in misfortune and I had only recently suffered exile and living an alien among foreigners, and had lost my fortune; in addition, I saw my mother and my sister driven from their native land and ending their lives in a foreign land among strangers. No one could justly begrudge it me, therefore, if I have received some benefit from the troublesome affairs of Thrasylochus; for it was to gratify him that I went to live in Troezen, where I experienced misfortunes so dire that I shall never be able to forget them.

	Furthermore, there is one thing my opponents cannot say of me—that when Thrasylochus was prosperous I suffered all these woes, but that I abandoned him in his adversity. For it was precisely then that I gave clearer and stronger proof of my devotion to

	him. When, for instance, he settled in Aegina and fell ill of the malady which resulted in his death, I nursed him with a care such as no one else I know of has ever bestowed upon another. Most of the time he was very ill, yet still able to go about; finally he lay for six months bedridden. And no one of his relations saw fit to share with me the drudgery of caring for him; no one even came to see him with the exception of his mother and sister; and they made the task more difficult; for they were ill when they came from Troezen, so that they themselves were in need of care. But although the others were thus indifferent, I did not grow weary nor did I leave the scene, but I nursed him with the help of one slave boy; for no one of the domestics could stand it. For being by nature irascible, he became, because of his malady, still more difficult to handle. It should not occasion surprise, therefore, that these persons would not remain with him, but it is much more a cause for wonder that I was able to hold out in caring for a man sick of such a malady; for he was filled with pus for a long time, and was unable to leave his bed; and his suffering was so great that we did not pass a single day without tears,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but kept up our lamentations both for the hardships we both had to endure, and for our exile and our isolation. And there was no intermission at any time; for it was impossible to leave him or to seem to neglect him—for to me this would have seemed more dreadful than the woes which afflicted us.

	duties involved in my care of the invalid, duties that were very hard, very difficult to endure, most disagreeably toilsome, and exacting an unremitting care. But do you yourselves consider what loss of sleep, what miseries are the inevitable accompaniment of a prolonged nursing of a malady like his. In truth, in my own case, I was reduced to such a condition that all my friends who visited me expressed fear that I too would perish with the dying man and they advised me to take care, saying that the majority of those who had nursed this disease themselves fell victims to it also. My reply to them was this—that I would much prefer to die than to see him perish before his fated day for lack of a friend to nurse him.

	And although my behaviour was as I have described, this woman has had the hardihood to contest with me his fortune, she who never even saw fit to visit him during his long illness, though she had daily information about his condition, and though the journey was easy for her. To think that they will now attempt to “brother” him,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] as if the effect of calling the dead man by a name of closer kinship would not be to make her shortcomings seem worse and more shocking! Why, when he was at the point of death, and when she saw all our fellow-citizens who were in Troezen sailing to Aegina to take part in his funeral, she did not even at that moment come, but was so cruel and heartless in conduct that while she did not see fit to come to his funeral, yet, less than ten days thereafter she arrived to claim the property he had left, as if she were related to his money and not to him! And if she will admit that her hatred for him was so bitter that this conduct was reasonable,

	then Thrasylochus would be considered not to have been ill-advised in preferring to leave his property to his friends rather than to this woman; but if there existed no variance between them and yet she was so neglectful of him and so unkind toward him, surely with greater justice would she be deprived of her own possessions than become heir to his. Bear in mind that, so far as she was concerned, he had no care during his illness, nor when he died was he thought worthy of the customary funeral rites, whereas it was through me that he obtained both. Surely you will justly cast your votes in favour, not of those who claim blood-relationship yet in their conduct have acted like enemies, but with much greater propriety you will side with those who, though having no title of relationship, yet showed themselves, when the deceased was in misfortune, more nearly akin than the nearest relatives.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	My opponents say that they do not doubt that Thrasylochus left the will, but they assert that it is not honourable and proper. And yet, citizens of Aegina, how could anyone have given better or greater evidence of interest in the disposal of his own property? He did not leave his home without heirs and he has shown due gratitude to his friends and, further, he made his mother and his sister possessors, not only of their own property, but of mine also by giving the latter to me as wife and by making me, by adoption, the son of the former. Would he have acted more wisely if he had taken the alternative course—if he had failed to appoint a protector for his mother, and if he had made no mention of me, but had abandoned his sister to chance and permitted the name of his family to perish?

	But perhaps I was unworthy of being adopted as a son by Thrasylochus and of receiving his sister in marriage. All the Siphnians would bear witness, however, that my ancestors were foremost of the citizens there in birth, in wealth, in reputation, and in general standing. For who were thought worthy of higher offices, or made greater contributions, or served as choregi[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] more handsomely, or discharged the other special public services with greater magnificence? What family in Siphnos has furnished more kings?[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] Thrasylochus, therefore, even if I had never spoken to him, would reasonably have wished to give his sister to me just for these reasons; and I, even if I had not possessed any of these advantages, but had been the lowest of the citizens, would justly have been esteemed by him as deserving of the greatest recompenses by reason of the services I had rendered him.

	I believe, moreover, that in making this disposition of his estate he did what was most pleasing to his brother Sopolis also. For Sopolis also hated this woman and regarded her as ill-disposed toward his interests, whereas he valued me above all his friends. He showed this feeling for me in many ways and in particular when our companions in exile determined, with the help of their auxiliary troops, to capture the city. For when he was designated leader with full powers he both chose me as secretary and appointed me treasurer of all funds, and when we were about to engage in battle, he placed me next to himself. And consider how greatly he profited thereby; for when our attack on the city met with ill success,

	and the retreat did not succeed as we desired, and when he was wounded, unable to walk and in a fainting condition, I and my servant carried him off on our shoulders to the ship. Consequently he often said to many persons that I was solely responsible for his coming through alive. Yet what greater benefaction than this could a man receive? Moreover, when he had sailed to Lycia and died there, this woman, a few days after the news of his death, was sacrificing and holding festival, and had no shame before his surviving brother, so little regard did she have for the dead man, but I instituted mourning for him in the custom prescribed for relatives. And it was my character and my affection for the two brothers that moved me to do all this and not any expectation of this trial; for I did not think that both would come to such an unhappy end that by dying without children they were going to oblige us to prove how each one of us had felt and acted toward them.

	How this woman and myself conducted ourselves toward Thrasylochus and Sopolis you have, in the main, heard; but perhaps they will have recourse to the one argument which remains to them—that Thrasyllus, the father of this woman, will feel that he is being dishonoured (if the dead have any perception of happenings in this world)[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] when he sees his daughter being deprived of her fortune and me becoming the heir of what he had acquired.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] But I am of opinion that it is proper for us to speak here, not concerning those who died long ago, but of those

	who recently left their heritage. As to Thrasyllus, he left as possessors of his estate the persons of his choice; and it is only just, then, that to Thrasylochus also the same privilege should be granted by you, and that not this woman, but those whom he designated in his will, should become the successors to the inheritance. However, I do not believe that I need evade the judgement of Thrasyllus. He would be, I think, the most harsh judge of all for her, if he knows how she has treated his children. If you should vote in accordance with the laws, he would be far from taking offence, but he would be far more incensed if he should see the testaments of his children annulled. If, for instance, Thrasylochus had given his property to my family, they would have had reason to lay that up against him; as it is, he adopted me into his own family, so that the plaintiffs have not received less than they gave.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Apart from this, it is reasonable to suppose that Thrasyllus, more than anyone else, was friendly toward those whose claims are based upon a testamentary gift. For he himself learned his art from Polemaenetus the soothsayer, and received his fortune, not through family relationship but through merit; surely, therefore, he would not complain if a man who had acted honourably toward his children should be regarded as deserving of the same reward as himself. You should call to mind also what I said in the beginning. For I pointed out to you that he esteemed relationship with our family so highly that he married the sister and then the cousin of my father.

	If, therefore, you award the inheritance to me, you will stand well with Thrasyllus and with all others who have any proper interest in this matter; but if you permit yourselves to be deceived by the persuasion of this woman, not only will you do injury to me, but also to Thrasylochus, the testator, and to Sopolis, and to their sister, who is now my wife, and their mother, who would be the unhappiest of women if it should not be enough for her to have lost her children, but also must see this additional sorrow, that their wishes are nullified, her family left without an heir, and this woman, as she exults over her misfortunes, making good at law her claim to the property, while I am unable to obtain my just rights, although my treatment of her sons has been such that, if anyone should compare me—I will not say with this woman, but with any who have ever entered their claim to an inheritance on the strength of a testamentary gift—I should be found to have been inferior to none in my conduct toward my friends. And yet men of my kind ought to be honoured and esteemed rather than be robbed of the gifts which others have bestowed upon them. It is expedient, too, that you should uphold the law which permits us to adopt children and to dispose wisely of our property, reflecting that for men who are childless this law takes the place of children; for it is owing to this law that both kinsmen and those who are not related take greater care of each other.

	in speaking, pray consider how strong and how just are the claims with which I have come before you; there is, first, my friendship with those who have left the inheritance, a friendship of ancient origin, handed down from our fathers, and in all that time never broken; second, my many great acts of kindness done for them in their adversity; third, there is a will which my opponents themselves acknowledge; and lastly, the law, which supports the will, a law that in the opinion of all Greeks is regarded as wisely made. Of my statement the best proof is this—although the Greek states differ in opinion about many other enactments, they are of one accord concerning this one. I beg you, therefore, bearing in mind both these considerations and the others I have mentioned, to give a just verdict, and prove yourselves to be for me such judges as you would want to have for yourselves.

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The law-suit which evoked this speech is an Action for Assault. The plaintiff, who calls himself “a poor man and one of the people” (§ 19), brings suit for heavy damages (§ 16) against a rich young citizen named Lochites, who had struck him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The beginning of the speech, in which presumably there would have been a presentation of the facts in the case and a citation of the testimony of witnesses, seems to be lacking. What we possess is a cleverly developed and amplified plea (αὔξησις). The speaker builds up, from a rather unimportant personal indignity (αἰκία) a case of wanton outrage (ὕβρις), or assault and battery, against the young aristocrat. Isocrates furnishes the speaker with a strong appeal to the judges emphasizing the necessity of restraining and punishing violence, especially under the rule of the democracy. The insolence of the aggressor is identified with the spirit and attitude of those oligarchs who twice overthrew the democracy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The approximate date[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] of the speech is ascertainable from internal evidence. In § 11 the accused is said to have been “too young to have belonged to the oligarchy established at that time” (404–403 b.c.). There is also in the same section a reference to the destruction of the walls of Athens which were razed in 404 b.c. and not rebuilt until 393 b.c.

	Well then, that Lochites struck me and was the aggressor all who were present when the event occurred have testified to you. But this offence should not be regarded as similar to other breaches of the law, nor should the penalty imposed for injury to the person be no greater than that which is inflicted for cheating a man of money; for you know that one’s person is of nearest concern to all men, and that it is for the protection of the person that we have established laws, that we fight for freedom, that we have our hearts set on the democratic form of government, and that all the activities of our lives are directed to this end. And so it is reasonable to expect you to punish with the greatest severity those who do wrong to you in respect to that which you prize most dearly.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You will find that our legislators also have had the greatest concern for our persons. For, in the first place, it is for this one kind of misdemeanour only that they have instituted public and private actions that require no preliminary court-deposit,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] with the intent that each of us, according to what may

	happen to be within his power and agreeable to his wish, may be able to exact punishment from those who wrong him. In the next place, in the case of other charges, the culprit may be prosecuted by the injured party only; but where assault and battery is involved, as the public interest is affected, any citizen who so desires may give notice of a public suit to the Thesmothetes[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and appear before your court. And our lawgivers regarded the giving of blows as an offence of such gravity that even for abusive language they made a law to the effect that those who used any of the forbidden opprobrious terms should pay a fine of five hundred drachmas. And yet how severe should the penalty be on behalf of those who have actually suffered bodily injury, when you show yourselves so angry for the protection of those who have merely suffered verbal injury?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It would be astonishing if, while you judge to be worthy of death those who were guilty of battery under the oligarchy, you shall allow to go unpunished those who, under the democracy, are guilty of the same practices. And yet the latter would justly meet with a more severe punishment; for they reveal more conspicuously their real baseness. This is what I mean: if anyone has the effrontery to transgress the law now, when it is not permissible, what would he have done, I ask you, when the government in power actually was grateful to such malefactors?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It may be that Lochites will attempt to belittle the importance of the affair, and ridiculing my accusation will say that I suffered no injury from his blows and that I am unduly exaggerating the gravity of what occurred. My reply to this is, that if no assault and battery had been connected with the affair, I

I observe that you, when you find anyone guilty of the robbery of a temple or of theft, do not assess the fine according to the value of what is stolen, but that you condemn all alike to death, and that you consider it just that those who attempt to commit the same crimes should pay the same penalty.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] You should, therefore, be of the same mind with respect to those who commit battery, and not consider whether they did not maul their victims thoroughly, but whether they transgressed the law, and you should punish them, not merely for the chance outcome of the attack, but for their character as a whole, reflecting that often ere now petty causes have been responsible for great evils, and that, because there are persons who have the effrontery to beat others, there have been cases where men have become so enraged that wounds, death, exile, and the greatest calamities have resulted. That no one of these consequences happened in my case is not due to the defendant; on the contrary, so far as he is concerned they have all taken place, and it was only by the grace of fortune and my character that no irreparable harm has been done.

For we ourselves have twice seen the democracy overthrown[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and twice we have been deprived of freedom, not by those who were guilty of other crimes, but by persons who contemned the laws and were willing to be slaves of the enemy while wantonly outraging their fellow-citizens. Lochites is one of these persons. For even though he was too young to have belonged to the oligarchy established at that time, yet his character at any rate is in harmony with their régime.

But since it is impossible to perceive who such men are before a victim has suffered at their hands, at any rate as soon as their character is recognized, it is the duty of all men to hate them and to regard them as enemies of all mankind.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Remember, too, that while the poor have no share in the danger of loss of property, yet fear of injury to our persons is common to all alike; in consequence, whenever you punish thieves and cheats you benefit only the rich, but whenever you chastise those who commit mayhem, you give aid to yourselves. You should therefore treat trials such as this as of the highest importance; and while in suits involving private contracts you should assess the plaintiff’s damages at only what it is fitting that he should receive, when the case is assault and battery the defendant should be required to pay so large a sum that he will in future refrain from his present unbridled wantonness. If, then, you deprive of their property those who conduct themselves with wanton violence toward their fellow-citizens and regard no fine as severe enough to punish those who do injury to the persons of others and have to pay the penalty with their money, you will then have discharged in full measure the duty of conscientious judges. Indeed in the present case you will thus render the correct

	Let no one of you think, just because he observes that I am a poor man and a man of the people, that the amount I claim should be reduced. For it is unjust that you should reckon the indemnification to be given to plaintiffs who are obscure as of less importance than that which men of distinction are to receive, and that the poor be thought inferior to the rich. For you would be lowering your own civic status if you should reach any such decisions where the many are concerned. Besides, it would be a most shocking state of affairs if in a democratic state we should not all enjoy equal rights; and if, while judging ourselves worthy of holding office, yet we should deprive ourselves of our legal rights; and if in battle we should all be willing to die for our democratic form of government and yet, in our votes as judges, especially favour men of property. No, if you will be advised by me, you will not assume that position toward your own selves. You will not teach the young men to have contempt for the mass of our citizens, nor consider that trials of this character are of no concern to you; on the contrary, each one of you will cast his ballot as if he were judging his own case. In truth, those who dare to transgress the law that protects your persons do injury to all alike.

	[b]Against Euthynus[/b]
	[b]Introduction[/b]
	The discourse [c dimgray]Against Euthynus,[/c][c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] designated in the manuscripts as a plea “Without Witnesses,” is an action brought to recover a deposit (παρακαταθήκης δίκη).
	The speaker is a friend of a certain Nicias who “was in need, the victim of injustice, and lacking in the ability to plead” (§ 1).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	During the rule of the Thirty Tyrants Nicias, because of threats of his enemies, deposited the sum of three talents with the defendant Euthynus. Later, desiring to leave Attica, he asked for the return of his money. Euthynus restored only two talents. At the time Nicias was unable to take any action, except to complain bitterly to friends. After the restoration of the democracy Nicias brought suit.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The date is manifestly soon after the democrats were restored to power, 403 b.c.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The speaker’s proof is made difficult because of the lack of witnesses which were customary in cases of deposit entrusted to private individuals.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] In consequence, the speaker affirms that his case must rest solely on presumptive evidence.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	[m1]\ [/m]

	[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]For a discussion of this speech, see Jebb, [c dimgray]Attic Orators[/c] ii. pp. 221–223 and Blass, [c dimgray]Die attische Beredsamkeit[/c] ii. pp. 219 ff. [c dimgray]Cf.[/c] also Mathieu, [c dimgray]Isocrate[/c] i. pp. 3–5.
	[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]Witnesses were not used, however, in making deposits with bankers ([c dimgray]cf.[/c] beginning of the [c dimgray]Trapeziticus[/c]).

	The authenticity of the speech has been suspected, but on insufficient grounds. It is cited by Aristotle ([c dimgray]Rhet.[/c] ii. 19); by Isocrates himself ([c dimgray]Panegyr.[/c] 188); and Diogenes Laertius (vi. 15) mentions an exercise, in reply to this speech of Isocrates, by Antisthenes. Philostratus ([c dimgray]Vit. Soph.[/c] i. 17) gives the discourse high praise. As the speech is a very early example of his forensic oratory, it is not surprising that it does not conform in style and method to the later epideictic compositions of Isocrates.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	We have evidence that Lysias wrote a speech for Euthynus in reply to Nicias. This discourse, not extant, was undoubtedly the reply of Euthynus in this case.

	[b]XXI. Against Euthynus[/b]
	[b](A Plea without Witnesses)[/b]
	I have no lack of reasons for speaking in behalf of the plaintiff Nicias; for it so happens that he is my friend, that he is in need, that he is the victim of injustice, and that he has no ability as a speaker; for all these reasons, therefore, I am compelled to speak on his behalf.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The circumstances in which the transaction between Nicias and Euthynus came to be made I shall relate to you in as few words as I can. This Nicias, the plaintiff, after the Thirty Tyrants came into power and his enemies threatened to expunge his name from the number of those who were to have the rights of citizenship, and to include him in Lysander’s[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] list, being in fear of the state of affairs, mortgaged his house, sent his slaves outside of Attica, conveyed his furniture to my house, gave in trust three talents of silver to Euthynus, and went to live in the country. Not long after this, desiring to take ship, he asked for the return of his money; Euthynus restored two talents, but denied that he had received the third. At that time Nicias was unable to take any further action, but he went to his friends and with complaints and recriminations told them how he had been treated. And yet he regarded Euthynus so highly and was in such fear of the government that he

	would sooner by far have been defrauded of a small sum and held his peace than have made complaints where no loss was suffered.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Such are the facts. But our cause presents difficulties. For Nicias, both when he was depositing the money and when he tried to get it back, had no one with him, either freeman or slave[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; thus it is impossible either by torture of slaves or by testimony to get at the facts, but it is by circumstantial evidence that we must plead and you must judge which side speaks the truth.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I think that you all know that malicious prosecution is most generally attempted by those who are clever speakers but possess nothing, whereas the defendants lack skill in speaking but are able to pay money. Well, Nicias is better off than Euthynus, but has less ability as a speaker; so that there is no reason why he should have proceeded against Euthynus unjustly. No indeed, but from the very facts in the case anyone can see that it is far more probable that Euthynus received the money and then denied having done so than that Nicias did not entrust it to him and then entered his complaint. For it is self-evident that it is always for the sake of gain that men do wrong. Now those who defraud others are in possession of the fruit of their crimes, but their accusers do not even know if they shall get back anything. Besides, when conditions in the city were unsettled and the courts were suspended, it was useless for Nicias to sue Euthynus and the latter had no cause for fear though guilty of the fraud. It was not surprising, therefore, at a time when those who had borrowed money even in the presence of witnesses denied it, that Euthynus should have

	robbed him of what he had received from him when neither was accompanied by witnesses. And it is not probable that at a time when not even those to whom money was justly owed could recover it, Nicias should have believed that he could obtain anything by an unjust accusation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And again, even if nothing had stood in his way and he could have brought a false accusation against him and wished to do so, it can easily be seen that Nicias would not have proceeded against Euthynus. For those who desire to act in this way do not begin with their friends, but in alliance with them proceed against others and accuse those for whom they have neither respect nor fear, persons whom they see to be rich, but friendless and helpless. Well then, in the case of Euthynus the opposite is true; he is the cousin of Nicias and has greater ability in speech and action, and although he has little money, he has many friends. In consequence, he is the last person whom Nicias would have proceeded against. And, in my opinion, knowing as I do their intimacy, neither would Euthynus ever have acted unjustly toward Nicias if he could have defrauded someone else of so large a sum. But as it was, their transaction was simple.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] It is possible to choose whomever you please from the whole body of citizens for accusation, but you can defraud only the man who has entrusted a deposit with you. Thus Nicias, if he had desired to get money by blackmail, would not have proceeded against Euthynus, but the latter, when he resorted to fraud, had no other victim available.

	oligarchy was in power, in which the situation of the two men was as follows: Nicias, even if he had been accustomed in former times to bring malicious accusations, then would have given up the practice, whereas Euthynus, even if he had never before given a thought to wrongdoing, then would have been tempted to act thus. For his misdeeds were bringing him honours, but Nicias, because of his wealth, was the object of plotting. For you are all aware that, at that time, it was a greater danger to be wealthy than to engage in wrongdoing, for the evil-doers were seizing the property of others, whereas the rich were losing their own. For it was the custom of those in whose hands the control of the city was, not to punish those who were guilty of offences, but to despoil the possessors of property, and they regarded the criminals as loyal and the wealthy as inimical.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Consequently it was not the problem before Nicias how he might get possession of the property of others by bringing malicious accusations, but how he might not be made a victim of wrongdoing, although himself innocent. For while any man who possessed the influence of Euthynus could steal what he had received on deposit and also bring charges against those to whom he had lent nothing, yet those who were in Nicias’ position were compelled to absolve their debtors of just debts and to surrender their own property to blackmailers. Euthynus himself could testify to the truth of what I say; for he knows that Timodemus extorted thirty minas from Nicias, not by demanding the payment of a debt, but by threatening him with summary arrest. And yet is it probable that Nicias went so far in folly that he was bringing malicious charges against others when

	his own life was in jeopardy; that he was plotting to get the goods of others when he was unable to protect his own; that he was making other enemies in addition to those he already had; that he was unjustly accusing persons from whom, even if they confessed the theft, he could not have exacted punishment; and that he was trying to get the better of others at the time when even to have equality with them was beyond his power; and, finally, at the time when he was being forced to pay back what he had not received, he hoped to collect what he had not lent?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Enough has been said concerning these matters. Perhaps Euthynus will repeat what indeed he has already said, that, if he had been trying to defraud Nicias, he never would have returned two-thirds of the deposit, while withholding merely the third part, but that whether he was intent upon acting unjustly or wished to act justly, he would have had the same intention in regard to the whole amount. But you all know, I think, that all men, when they set about committing a crime, at the same time are looking about for a plea in defence; consequently, it should occasion no surprise that Euthynus, in view of this very argument, committed the crime. Besides, I could point out other men also who, after having received money, have restored the major portion of it, but retained a small part, and men who, though guilty of dishonesty in petty contracts, yet in important ones have shown themselves honest; therefore, Euthynus is not the only person, nor yet the first, who has acted so. You must remember that, if you ever countenance such a plea by defendants, you will be establishing a legal provision as to

	the way a fraud should be committed; consequently, in the future, holders of deposits will indeed return a part, but will retain a part for themselves. For it will be to their advantage, if they can use their repayment of some as presumptive proof so that they will not be punished for their stealing the rest.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Consider, also, that it is easy to use on behalf of Nicias arguments similar to those employed in the defence of Euthynus. For instance, when Nicias recovered the two talents, no one was present as his witness; so that, if he wanted to make a malicious accusation and that seemed best to him, it is obvious that he would not have acknowledged the receipt of even the two talents, but would have made the same plea for the entire amount; in that case, Euthynus would now be liable to lose even a larger sum, and at the same time he would not be able to use the presumptive proof on which he now depends.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And, furthermore, no one can point to any culpable motive whatever that led Nicias to enter an accusation against Euthynus, but as to Euthynus, it is easy to see the reasons which induced him to commit a crime in that manner. For when Nicias was in adversity, all his relations and friends had heard him say that he had deposited his money with Euthynus. Euthynus knew, therefore, that many persons were aware that the money was in his keeping, but that no one knew the amount; in consequence he thought that if he diminished the amount he would not be found out, but if he withheld the whole sum, his guilt would be manifest. Therefore, he chose to take enough and have left a plea in his defence rather than to pay nothing back and be left without a possibility of denial.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	[b]General Introduction[/b]
	Nine [c dimgray]Letters[/c] of Isocrates have been preserved. It is true that in his many extant discourses Isocrates himself furnishes more information of a personal nature than is generally the case with writers of antiquity, but his [c dimgray]Letters[/c] serve to amplify what is elsewhere found and give some new facts. In general, however, the [c dimgray]Letters[/c] are “less personal than general in tone and subject-matter, and might be classed with his political writings.”[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The [c dimgray]Letters[/c] are all addressed by Isocrates to rulers and princes. Four were written to kings and warlords in furtherance of his long cherished plan, advocated for thirty-four years, that a strong leader should unite the discordant states of Greece in a common cause, and with a powerful army assembled from all Greece invade Asia and conquer Persia. This idea impelled the educator and publicist to send [c dimgray]Epistle[/c] 1 to Dionysius the Elder, tyrant of Syracuse; [c dimgray]Epistles[/c] 2 and 3 to King Philip of Macedon; and [c dimgray]Epistle[/c] 9 to Archidarnas of Sparta.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Epistle[/c] 4, to Antipater, regent of Macedon, is the most informal and personal of the [c dimgray]Letters[/c] and is a letter of recommendation on behalf of a pupil.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[c dimgray]Epistle[/c] 5 has particular interest in that it is addressed to Alexander, who was, at the time the letter

	was written, a boy of about fourteen years of age, and in all probability had just been placed in the charge of Aristotle as tutor. In this short letter Isocrates refers to the favourable reports which he had heard concerning the young prince and prophesies that “if, as you grow older, you hold fast to your present course, you will surpass the rest in wisdom as far as your father has surpassed all men.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In [c dimgray]Epistles[/c] 6 ([c dimgray]To the Children of Jason[/c], in Thessaly) and 7 ([c dimgray]To Timotheus[/c], ruler of Heracleia on the Euxine), Isocrates assumes his favourite rôle of mentor, and gives counsel to those even of exalted station. [c dimgray]Epistle[/c] 8 ([c dimgray]To the Rulers of the Mytilenaeans[/c]) was written on behalf of the musician Agenor and his family and is a plea to those in authority to permit them to return home from exile.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In their probable chronological order the [c dimgray]Letters[/c] may be placed in the following sequence: [c dimgray]Epistle[/c] 1 (368 b.c.); 6 (359 b.c.); 9 (356 b.c.); 8 (350 b.c.); 7 (345 b.c.); 2 (342 b.c.); 5 (342 b.c.); 4 (340 b.c.); 3 (338 b.c.). Isocrates was 68 years of age at the time of writing the earliest extant letter; the last letter was written just before his death at the great age of 98 years.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In conclusion, a few words should be said about the formerly much-discussed question of the authenticity of these [c dimgray]Letters[/c] which have come down to us with Isocrates designated as their author. Since some letters and documents from antiquity have been proved by modern scholarship to be indubitably spurious,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] there has been a tendency to be sceptical

	Introduction
	The first of the extant [c dimgray]Letters[/c] of Isocrates is addressed to Dionysius the Elder, who was tyrant of Syracuse in Sicily from 405 b.c. to 367 b.c. The letter, as we have it, is incomplete; it is merely the introduction to a communication which was evidently of considerable length. From the general tenor of the beginning of the letter it is obvious that Isocrates went on to a discussion of his favourite theme, namely, the urgent need of a united Greece which would make feasible a common military expedition against Persia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In his [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c] Isocrates had urged Athens to no avail to assume the leadership in this cause and in the [c dimgray]To Philip[/c] (129) he asserts that he had petitioned Athens first of all Greek powers. This letter to Dionysius is evidently an appeal to the Sicilian tyrant to take the lead.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Isocrates wrote this letter in his old age, as he tells us in § 1, and it is later than the [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c] (380 b.c.). § 8 of the letter helps to give the probable date. Isocrates says that the Lacedaemonians are no longer in power (Sparta was defeated at Leuctra in 371 b.c.). In 368 b.c. Dionysius was again waging war with the Carthaginians and at first met with success. This would seem to be the time when the letter was written.

	I know, to be sure, that when men essay to give advice, it is far preferable that they should come in person rather than send a letter, not only because it is easier to discuss the same matters face to face than to give their views by letter, nor yet because all men give greater credence to the spoken rather than to the written word, since they listen to the former as to practical advice and to the latter as to an artistic composition[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; but also, in addition to these reasons, in personal converse, if anything that is said is either not understood or not believed, the one who is presenting the arguments, being present, can come to the rescue in either case; but when written missives are used and any such misconception arises, there is no one to correct it,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] for since the

Nevertheless, since you are to be the judge in this matter, I have great hope that I shall prove to be saying something of value, as I think you will disregard all the difficulties just mentioned and will direct your attention to the matters themselves.

	And yet, certain persons who have been admitted to your presence have attempted to frighten me, saying that while you honour flatterers, you despise those who offer you advice. If I had believed their words, I should have remained quiet; but as it is, no one could persuade me that it is possible that a man should so surpass others in both judgement and action, unless he has become a learner, a listener, and a discoverer, and has drawn to himself and collected from every possible source those means which will enable him to exercise his own intellectual ability.

	It was for these reasons, then, that I have been moved to write you. I intend to speak to you about important matters, matters about which no living person may more fittingly hear than you. And do not think that I am earnestly urging you in this way that you may become a listener to a rhetorical composition; for I am not, as it happens, in a mood to seek glory through rhetorical show-pieces, nor am I unaware that you on your part are sated with such offerings. Furthermore, one thing is evident to all, that while our public festivals offer fitting occasions to those who want to make an oratorical display (for there, in the presence of the greatest numbers, they may spread the fame of their eloquence abroad), yet those who wish to bring some serious thing to pass should address the man who is likely most promptly to accomplish in deed that which the word has

	In truth, it will be seen that not inopportunely I make mention of these matters. For when the Lacedaemonians were in power, it was not easy for you to take upon yourself the responsibility for the affairs in our region, nor to oppose the Lacedaemonians and at the same time fight the Carthaginians. But now, when the Lacedaemonians are in such a plight that they are content if they can remain in possession of their own land, and when our city would gladly join with you as ally in any struggle that you should care to make in behalf of the welfare of Greece, how could there befall a more favourable opportunity than that which now presents itself to you?
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Do not think it strange[c dimgray][sup]d[/sup][/c] that I, who am not an orator who moves public assemblies, nor a leader of armies, nor otherwise a man of power, am undertaking so difficult an affair and am attempting two of the most serious things—to speak on behalf of Greece and at the same time to give counsel to you. For at the beginning of my career I stood aloof from participation in public affairs (the reasons for this would be tedious to relate),[c dimgray][sup]e[/sup][/c] but of that culture

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	In the collection of [c dimgray]Letters[/c]of Isocrates two ([c dimgray]Epistles[/c] 2 and 3) are addressed to Philip.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In [c dimgray]Letter[/c] 2, Isocrates rebukes King Philip of Macedon, recently wounded in fighting barbarians, for his recklessness in unnecessarily assuming personal risks in war. Now Philip was occupied with a Thracian war from 342 to 339 b.c. and it is obvious from the tone of the letter, and the references to the friendly relations between Athens and Philip, that the war between Athens and Macedon, declared in 340 b.c., had not broken out. Furthermore, in § 20 of the letter, the orator refers to recent relations between Philip and the Thessalians which were effected in 342 b.c. In consequence, this letter may be assigned to the year 342 b.c.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	After counselling Philip to greater prudence in warfare, Isocrates appeals for more amicable relations between Macedon and Athens, and suggests that Philip should lead a common Greek expedition against Persia.

	I know that all men are accustomed to be more grateful to those who praise them than to those who give them counsel,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] especially if one offers his advice unbidden. And if I had not on a former occasion[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] given you with most kindly intent such counsel as I believed would lead to a course of action worthy of one in your position, perhaps even now I should not be undertaking to declare my view concerning what has happened to you. But since I then did decide to concern myself with your affairs, in the interests of my own state and of the other Greeks as well, I should be ashamed if, when comparatively unimportant things were the issue, I am known to have offered you advice, yet now I should have nothing to say concerning more urgent matters, particularly since I realize that in the former case your reputation alone was at stake, whereas at present it is your personal safety, which you have been thought to esteem too lightly by all who heard the abusive reproaches directed against you. In truth there is no one who has not condemned you as being more reckless in assuming risks than is becoming to a king, and as caring more for men’s praise of your courage than for the general welfare. For it is equally disgraceful, when your enemies threaten on every side, not to prove

	I think that you would profitably imitate the fashion in which our city-states conduct the business of warfare. They all are accustomed, when they send forth an army, to take measures to secure the safety of the government and of the authority which is to decide what is to be done in the emergency. In consequence, if a single mischance befalls, their power is not also wholly destroyed; on the contrary, they can sustain many misfortunes and again recover their strength. This principle you too should take into consideration, and consider no blessing more important than your safety, in order that you may not only duly make use of the victories which may be yours but also may rectify the mischances that may befall you. You might observe that the Lacedaemonians also are extremely solicitous for the safety of their kings,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and appoint the most distinguished of the citizens as their bodyguards, and that

	for them it is a greater disgrace to suffer the kings to meet death than to throw away their shields. And surely you are not unaware of what happened to Xerxes when he wished to enslave the Greeks and to Cyrus when he laid claim to the kingdom. Thus Xerxes, although he had suffered defeats and calamities of such magnitude the like of which have never been known to befall other kings, because he preserved his life, not only retained his throne and handed it over to his children, but also so administered Asia that it was no less formidable to the Greeks than before. Cyrus, however, after he had conquered all the military might of the king, would have gained mastery of the throne had it not been for his rashness,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] which caused him not only to forfeit that mighty empire, but brought his followers into extreme danger. And I could mention very many men who, becoming commanders of great armies, because they were slain before they need have died, brought destruction at the same time upon countless numbers of their followers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Bearing these examples in mind, you should not honour that courage which accompanies heedless folly and unseasonable ambition, nor, when so many hazards which are inherent in monarchy are at hand, should you devise for yourself still others that bring no glory and belong to the common soldier; nor should you vie with those who wish to escape from an unhappy existence or who rashly incur danger in the hope of a higher wage; nor should you desire such glory as many, both Greeks and barbarians, obtain, but rather that exalted renown which you alone of living men could win. Nor should you be enamoured of such virtues as even ignoble men share,

	omit discussion of the affairs of the city of Athens; on the contrary, I must try to urge you to cultivate friendly relations and intimacy with her. For I think there are many who report to you and tell you not only the most disparaging of the things said of you among us, but also add their own inventions; but it is not reasonable for you to pay any attention to these persons. For you would in fact be acting inconsistently if you should find fault with our people for lending a ready ear to your calumniators, but yourself should be found giving credence to those who practise this art and should not perceive that the more easily influenced by nobodies such persons declare our city to be, the better suited to your ends they prove it. For if those who are powerless to be of any service to Athens can accomplish by words alone what they wish, surely it is right to expect that you, who are able in very deed to confer upon her the greatest benefits, would not fail to gain from us anything whatever.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	To the bitter accusers of our city I think I should place in contrast those who say that the very opposite is true, that is, those who assert that she has done no wrong at all, whether great or small. For my part, I would not make any such claim; for I should be ashamed if, while men in general do not regard even the gods as blameless, I should dare to affirm that our city had never transgressed at all.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Nevertheless, this I can say of Athens—that you could not find a city more useful to all the Greeks and to your enterprises; and to this fact you should give your special attention.

	she bring about many advantages to you, but even if she merely was believed to be on friendly terms with you. For you might then more easily keep in subjection those who are now under your sway, if they should have no refuge, and of the barbarians you could more quickly conquer any you should wish. Yet is there any reason why you should not eagerly grasp at a relationship of goodwill such that you will hold securely not only your present dominion, but also without risk acquire another great one? I marvel that so many who maintain great forces hire mercenary armies and expend so much money on them, although they know that such help has been the cause of greater injury than of salvation to those who relied upon them, and have made no effort to gain the friendship of a city which possesses such power that it has ere now often saved every Hellenic state and indeed all Greece.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] Consider, too, that to many you appear to have been well advised because your treatment of the Thessalians[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] has been just and advantageous to them, although they are a people not easy to handle, but high-spirited and seditious. You should, therefore, endeavour to show yourself equally prudent towards us also, knowing as you do that, while the Thessalians have the territory next to you, it is we who are next to you in strength and influence, and that is what you should seek in every way to win for yourself. For it is a much greater glory to capture the goodwill of cities than their walls[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]; for achievements like the latter not only engender ill-will, but men attribute the credit for them to your armies; yet if you are able to win friend-ships

	You may well believe me in what I have said concerning Athens; for you will find that I have not been accustomed to flatter her in my discourses; on the contrary, more than anyone else I have censured her[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; nor am I highly esteemed by the masses or by those who form their opinions offhand, but, like yourself, I am misunderstood and disliked by them. But we are dissimilar in this, that they are thus disposed toward you because of your power and prosperity, but toward me because I lay claim to a wisdom greater than their own, and they see that more people wish to converse with me than with themselves. I could wish that it were equally easy for us both to dispel the prejudice in which we are held by these; but as it is, you will put an end to it without difficulty if you wish, but I must be content with the standing I now have because of my old age and for many other reasons.

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	This short letter to Philip was written in the autumn of 338 b.c., not long after the Athenian defeat at Chaeronea. Isocrates was ninety-eight years of age, in feeble health, and died shortly thereafter. It is the latest of all his extant writings.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Again the orator urges Philip, with a united Hellas, to undertake a military expedition against Asia and the Persians, a theme dear to his heart and already expounded at length in the [c dimgray]Panegyricus[/c] (380 b.c.) and in his discourse [c dimgray]To Philip[/c] (346 b.c.).
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The authenticity of this letter has been questioned, on insufficient grounds, by some scholars.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] It is accepted by Blass, Jebb, and Mathieu.

	[b]Letter 3. to Philip, II[/b]
	I have discussed with Antipater[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] the course which is expedient for our city and for you, at sufficient length, I am convinced; but I wished to write to you also regarding the action which I think should be taken after the conclusion of peace, and while this advice is similar to that in my discourse,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] it is, however, expressed much more concisely.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At that time, you recall, I counselled you that, after you had reconciled our city with Sparta, Thebes, and Argos, you should bring all the Greeks into concord, as I was of opinion that if you should persuade the principal cities to be favourably inclined to such a course, the others also would quickly follow. At that time, however, the state of affairs was different, and now it has come to pass that the need of persuasion no longer exists; for on account of the battle[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] which has taken place, all are compelled to be prudent and to desire that which they surmise you wish to do and to say, namely, that they must desist from the madness and the spirit of aggrandizement, which they were wont to display in their relations with each other, and must carry the war into Asia. Many inquire of me whether I advised

I reply that I do not know for certain, since before then I had not been acquainted with you, but that I supposed that you had reached a decision in this matter and that I in my speech had fallen in with your desires. On hearing this, all entreated me to encourage you and to exhort you to hold fast to this same resolution, since they believe that no achievement could be more glorious, more useful to the Greeks, or more timely than this will be.

	If I possessed the same vigour which I formerly had and were not utterly spent with years,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] I should not be speaking with you by letter, but in your presence should myself be spurring and summoning you to undertake these tasks. But even as it is, I do exhort you, as best I can, not to put these matters aside until you bring them to a successful conclusion. To have an insatiate desire for anything else in the world is ignoble—for moderation is generally esteemed—but to set the heart upon a glory that is great and honourable, and never to be satiated with it, befits those men who have far excelled all others.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] And that is true of you. Be assured that a glory unsurpassable and worthy of the deeds you have done in the past will be yours when you shall compel the barbarians—all but those who have fought on your side—to be serfs of the Greeks, and when you shall force the king who is now called Great to do whatever you command.

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	This is the most informal and personal of the [c dimgray]Letters[/c] of Isocrates. It is a letter of recommendation to Antipater,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] regent of Macedonia in Philip’s absence, whose acquaintance Isocrates had made in Athens on the several occasions when Antipater had been sent as Macedonian envoy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The letter is written on behalf of a certain Diodotus, a pupil of Isocrates, and for the son of Diodotus, who are not known otherwise. The protection and favour of Antipater are solicited and the good character, frankness, and usefulness of Diodotus are emphasized.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The authenticity of the letter has been challenged, without good reason, on stylistic grounds, because of its informality and the occurrence of a few rare and colloquial words and expressions.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] That the letter is genuine is maintained by Blass, Jebb, Drerup, and Mathieu.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The date is indicated in the first sentence—“now when we are at war with you”—as being soon after the renewal of war between Philip and Athens in 340, or 339 b.c.

	Although it is dangerous for us here in Athens to send a letter to Macedonia, not only now when we are at war with you,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] but even in time of peace, nevertheless I have decided to write to you concerning Diodotus,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] as I think it only right to esteem highly all those who have been my pupils and who have shown themselves worthy disciples, and not the least among them this man both because of his devotion to me and of the general probity of his character. I wish that if possible I might have been the means of his introduction to you; since, however, he has already met you through the kindness of others, it remains for me to give my testimony concerning him and to strengthen the acquaintance which he already has with you. For although many men of various countries have been my pupils[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and some of these are of great repute, and while of all the others some have proved to be distinguished for eloquence alone, and others in intellect and in practical affairs, and still others have indeed been men of sobriety of life and cultivated tastes, but for general usefulness in the practical affairs of life utterly devoid of natural ability, yet Diodotus has been endowed with

	a nature so well balanced that in all the attributes I have named he is quite perfect.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	All this I should not dare to say of him if I did not possess the most precise knowledge of him gained by experience, and if I were not anticipating that you would gain the same, partly through your own association with him and partly from the testimony of his acquaintances, of whom there is no one who would not agree, unless he be exceedingly envious, that Diodotus is inferior to none in eloquence and counsel, and that he is very honest, temperate, and self-controlled in respect to money; nay more, to spend the day with and to live with he is a most charming and agreeable[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] companion. In addition to these good qualities he possesses frankness in the highest degree, not that outspokenness which is objectionable, but that which would rightly be regarded as the surest indication of devotion to his friends. This is the sort of frankness which princes, if they have worthy and fitting greatness of soul, honour as being useful, while those whose natural gifts are weaker than the powers they possess take such frankness ill, as if it forced them to act in some degree contrary to their desires—ignorant as they are that those who dare to speak out most fearlessly in opposition to measures in which expediency is the issue are the very persons who can provide them with more power than others to accomplish what they wish. For it stands to reason that it is because of those who always and by choice speak to please that not only monarchies cannot endure—since monarchies are liable to numerous inevitable dangers—but even constitutional governments as well, though they enjoy greater security: whereas it is owing to those

	who speak with absolute frankness in favour of what is best that many things are preserved even of those which seemed doomed to destruction. For these reasons it is indeed fitting that in the courts of all monarchs those who declare the truth should be held in greater esteem than those who, though they aim to gratify in all they say, yet say naught that merits gratitude; in fact, however, the former find less favour with some princes.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	This experience Diodotus has met with in his relations with some of the potentates of Asia, to whom he had often been of service, not only in offering counsel, but also in venturing upon dangerous deeds; because of his frankness of speech in matters involving their best interests he has been both deprived of honours he had at home and cheated of many hopes elsewhere, and the flattery of men of no consequence had greater weight than his own good services. That, then, is the reason why Diodotus, although from time to time he entertained the thought of presenting himself to you, hesitated to do so, not because he believed that all his superiors were alike, but because the difficulties which he had experienced with these rulers caused him to be rather faint-hearted with reference also to the hopes he placed in you. That feeling was, I fancy, like that of some persons who have been at sea, who when they have once experienced a tempest, no longer with confidence embark upon a voyage, even though they know that one may often meet with a fair sailing. Nevertheless, now that he has met you, he is taking the right course. For I reason that this will be to his advantage, chiefly conjecturing so on the strength of that kindliness which you have been

	But I think that Diodotus himself will best induce you to take an interest in him. His son also I have advised to espouse your cause and by putting himself in your hands as a pupil, to try to advance himself. When I gave him this advice he declared that while he craved your friendship, yet he felt toward that very much as he does toward the athletic contests in which crowns are awarded to the victors; victory in them he would gladly win, but to enter the lists to gain them he would not dare, because he had not acquired the strength that would deserve the crowns. Similarly, while he longed to obtain the honours it is yours to bestow, yet he did not expect to attain them; for he is appalled not only by his own inexperience but also by the splendour of your position; furthermore, he believes that his poor body, not being sound but somewhat defective, will impede him in many activities.

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	This brief letter to Alexander accompanied one[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] sent to his father Philip, who was in Thrace or the Chersonese, in 342 b.c. Alexander at this time was a boy of fourteen and, in all probability, had just been placed under Aristotle as instructor. This affords Isocrates opportunity again to express his disapproval of [c dimgray]eristic[/c],[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and to affirm the great value of rhetorical training as he himself taught it.

	But this branch of learning, I am told, you are not content with, but you choose rather the training which rhetoric gives, which is of use in the practical affairs of everyday life and aids us when we deliberate concerning public affairs. By means of this study you will come to know how at the present time to form reasonably sound opinions about the future, how not ineptly to instruct your subject peoples what each should do, how to form correct judgements about the right and the just and their opposites and, besides, to reward and chastise each class as it deserves. You act wisely, therefore, in devoting yourself to these studies; for you give hope to your father and to all the world that if, as you grow older, you hold fast to this course, you will as far surpass your fellow-men in wisdom as your father has surpassed all mankind.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	Jason, tyrant of Pherae in Thessaly, was assassinated in 370 b.c.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and was succeeded by his brothers Polydorus and Polyphron. But deeds of violence continued. Polyphron, having murdered his brother, was himself slain by Alexander, son of Polydorus. Alexander, however, was murdered (359 b.c.) at the instigation of his wife Thebê (daughter of Jason) by her half-brothers.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It is to Thebê and her half-brother Tisiphonus (the children of Jason), who had assumed the power, that this letter was written, in 359 b.c.,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] urging them to a moderate course in governing their state.

	One of our envoys who were sent to you has brought me word that you, summoning him apart from the others, asked whether I could be persuaded to go abroad and reside with you. And I for the sake of my friendship with Jason and Polyalces would gladly come to you; for I think such an association would benefit us all. Many things hinder me, however, especially my inability to travel and that it is unseemly that men of my age should dwell in a foreign land; next, because all who heard of my residence abroad would justly despise me if, having chosen to pass my former life in tranquillity, I should undertake in old age to spend my life abroad, when it would be reasonable for me, even if I had been accustomed to live somewhere else, now to hasten home, since the end of my life is now so near at hand. Moreover, I have fears for Athens, since the truth must be told; for I see that alliances made with her are soon dissolved. So, if anything of that kind should happen between Athens and you, even if I could escape the ensuing accusations and dangers, which would be difficult, yet I should be ashamed if I should be thought by any either to be neglectful of you on account of my city, or on your account to be indifferent to the interests of Athens.

	how I could please both sides. Such, then, are the reasons why I cannot do as I wish.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But I do not think that I should write to you about my own affairs only and be indifferent to yours; on the contrary, just as I would have done had I come to you, I will now try to discuss these same matters to the best of my ability. And pray do not entertain any such notion as that I have written this letter, not on account of your friendship, but for the purpose of making a rhetorical display. For I have not become so demented as not to know that I could not write anything better than my previously published discourses, being now so far past my prime, and that if I produce anything much inferior in merit, I should find my present reputation grievously impaired. Besides, if I were intent upon producing a composition for display instead of having your interest at heart, I should not have chosen of all available subjects that one which is difficult to treat passably well, but I should have found other themes, much nobler and more logical. But the truth is that never at any time have I prided myself on the compositions of the former kind, but rather upon the latter, which most people have disregarded, nor have I undertaken my present theme with that intention, but because I see that your troubles are many and serious and wish to give you my own opinion concerning them. And I think that for the giving of counsel I am in my prime—for men of my age are trained by experience, which enables them to perceive more clearly than the younger men the best course of action—but
	to speak upon any proposed subject with grace, elegance, and finish is no longer to be expected

	at my age[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; indeed, I shall be content if I discuss these matters in a not altogether negligent fashion.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Do not be surprised if I am found saying something which you have heard before; for one statement I may perhaps chance upon unwittingly, another I may consciously employ, if it is pertinent to the discussion. Certainly I should be foolish if, although I see others using my thoughts, I alone should refrain from employing what I have previously said.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] This is the reason, then, for these introductory words, that the very first precept I shall present is one of those most often repeated. I am accustomed, that is, to tell the students in my school of rhetoric[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] that the first question to be considered is—what is the object to be accomplished by the discourse as a whole and by its parts? And when we have discovered this and the matter has been accurately determined, I say that we must seek the rhetorical elements whereby that which we have set out to do may be elaborated and fulfilled. And this procedure I prescribe with reference to discourse, yet it is a principle applicable not only to all other matters, but also to your own affairs. For nothing can be intelligently accomplished unless first, with full forethought, you reason and deliberate how you ought to direct your own future, what mode of life you should choose, what kind of repute you should set your heart upon, and which kind of honours you should be contented with—those freely granted by your fellow-citizens
	or those wrung from them against their will; and when these principles have been determined,

	then and only then should your daily actions be considered, in order that they may be in conformity with the original plan. If in this way you seriously search and study, you will take mental aim, as at a mark, at what is expedient for you, and will be the more likely to hit it. And if you have no such plan, but attempt to act in casual fashion, inevitably you will go astray in your purposes and fail in many undertakings.

	Perhaps some one of those who choose to live planlessly
	may attempt to disparage such reasoning and ask that I give my advice forthwith with regard to what has just been said. Hence I must not shrink from declaring my honest opinion about it. To me the life of a private citizen seems preferable and better than that of a king, and I regard the honours received under constitutional governments as more gratifying than those under monarchies.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] It is of these honours I shall endeavour to speak. And yet I am not unaware that I shall have many adversaries, especially among those who are in your circle, because these persons especially, I think, urge you to despotic power; for they do not examine from all sides the real nature of the question, but in many ways deceive themselves. For it is the powers, the profits, and the pleasures that they see in royalty and expect to enjoy them, whereas they fail to observe the disturbances, the fears, and the misfortunes which befall rulers and their friends. Instead they suffer from the same delusion as do men who set their hands to the most disgraceful and lawless deeds. These in fact are

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	This letter is written to Timotheüs, who was ruler of Heracleia on the Euxine Sea. Clearchus, the father of Timotheüs, had been a pupil of Isocrates and was generally esteemed for his kindliness and humanity.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] But when he returned to Heracleia, and became tyrant, in 364 b.c., he ruled for twelve years with great cruelty. At his death, in 353 b.c., he was succeeded by his brother Satyrus, as regent, who, after holding power for some seven years, gave up the throne to Timotheüs, son of Clearchus, who reigned from about 346 to 338 b.c. The government under Timotheüs was milder and more democratic, and Isocrates writes to congratulate him on this wise policy, to renew old ties of friendship, and to give him, in typical fashion, good advice for his future conduct. The bearer of the letter, Autocrator, a friend of Isocrates, is recommended to the good graces of the king.

	The date of the letter is evidently about 345 b.c. and its authenticity is not open to question.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	Of the friendly relations which exist between your family and me I think you have heard from many sources, and I congratulate you as I receive word, first that you are making use of the princely power you now possess in better and wiser fashion than your father,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] and also, that you choose rather to win good repute than to amass great wealth. In making this your purpose you give no slight indication of virtue, but the very greatest; so that, if you are faithful to your present reputation, you will not lack those who will praise both your wisdom and this choice. I think that the reports which have been noised abroad about your father will also contribute a great deal of credibility to the general opinion of your good judgement and superiority to all others; for most men are wont to praise and honour, not so much the sons of fathers who are of good repute, as those born of harsh and cruel fathers, provided that they show themselves to be similar in no respect to their parents. For any boon which comes to men contrary to reason always gives them greater pleasure than those which duly come to pass in accordance with their expectation.

	in what fashion, with the aid of whom, and by employing what counsellors you are to repair your city’s misfortunes, to spur your citizens on to their labours and to temperate conduct, and to cause them to live more happily and more confidently than in the past; for this is the duty of good and wise kings. Some, disdaining these obligations, look to nothing else save how they may themselves lead lives of the greatest licentiousness and may mistreat and pillage by taxation the best and wealthiest and most sagacious of their subjects, being ill aware that wise men who hold that high office should not, at the cost of injury to all the rest, provide pleasures for themselves, but rather should by their own watchful care make their subjects happier[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; nor should they, while being harshly and cruelly disposed toward all, yet be careless of their own safety; on the contrary, their conduct of affairs should be so gentle and so in accordance with the law that no one will venture to plot against them; yet they should rigorously guard their persons as if everybody wished to kill them. For if they should adopt this policy, they would themselves be free from danger and at the same time be highly esteemed by all; blessings greater than these it would be difficult to discover. I have been thinking, as I write, how happily everything has fallen out for you. The wealth which could only have been acquired forcibly and despotically and at the cost of much hatred, has been left to you by your father, but to use it honourably and for the good of mankind has devolved upon you[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]; and to this task you should devote yourself with great diligence.

	These, then, are my views; but this is the application: If your heart is set upon money and greater power and dangers too, through which these possessions are acquired, you must summon other advisers; but if you already have enough of these and wish virtue, fair reputation, and the goodwill of your subjects in general, you should heed my words and emulate those rulers who govern their states well and should endeavour to surpass them.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I hear that Cleommis, who in Methymna holds this royal power, is noble and wise in all his actions, and that so far from putting any of his subjects to death, or exiling them, or confiscating their property, or injuring them in any other respect, he provides great security for his fellow-citizens, and restores the exiles, returning to those who come back their lost possessions, and in each case recompenses the purchasers the price they had paid. In addition, he gives arms to all the citizens, thinking that none will try to revolt from him; but even if any should dare it, he believes that his death after having shown such generosity to the citizens would be preferable to continued existence after becoming the author of the greatest evils to his city.

	I should have discussed these matters with you at greater length, and perhaps also in a more attractive style, were I not under the stern necessity of writing the letter in haste. As it is, I will counsel you at a later time if my old age does not prevent; for the present I will speak concerning our personal relations.

For all those reasons I would have you use him well and in a manner profitable to us both, and that it may become evident that his needs are being realized in some measure through my efforts. And do not marvel that I am so ready to write to you, though I never made any request of your father Clearchus. For almost all who have sailed hither from your court say that you resemble my best pupils. But as for Clearchus when he visited us, all who met him agreed that he was at that time the most liberal, kindly, and humane of the members of my school; but when he gained his power he seemed to change in disposition so greatly that all who had previously known him marvelled. For these reasons I was estranged from him; but you I esteem and I should highly value your friendly disposition toward myself. And you yourself will soon make it clear if you reciprocate my regard; for you will be considerate of Autocrator, and send me a letter renewing our former friendship and hospitality.

	In this letter Isocrates addresses the oligarchic government of Mytilenê in Lesbos, which had overthrown the democracy not long before. Since the oligarchs had shown unexpected clemency and moderation[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] the orator, on the insistent request of his grandsons, begs for the restoration from exile of the distinguished musician Agenor, their teacher, and his family.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The authenticity of [c dimgray]Letter[/c] 8 is unquestioned. The date appears to be 350 b.c., as may be determined from § 8, where Isocrates says that “if Conon and Timotheüs were still living and Diophantus had returned from Asia” they would support his plea. Timotheüs, son of Conon, had died in 354 b.c., and Diophantus the Athenian was serving the king of Egypt against Artaxerxes Ochus in 351–350 b.c.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	[b]Letter 8. To the Rulers of the Mytilenaeans[/b]
	The sons of Aphareus,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] my grandsons, who were instructed in music by Agenor,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] have asked me to write to you and beg that, since you have restored some of the other exiles, you will also allow Agenor, his father, and his brothers to return home. When I told them that I feared I should appear ridiculous and meddlesome in seeking so great a favour from men with whom I have never before spoken or been acquainted, they, upon hearing my reply, were all the more insistent. And when they could obtain nothing of what they hoped, they clearly showed to all that they were displeased and sorely disappointed. So when I saw that they were unduly distressed I finally promised to write the letter and send it to you. That I may not justly seem foolish and irksome I make this explanation.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I think you have been well advised both in becoming reconciled to your fellow-citizens and, while trying to reduce the number of exiles, in increasing that of the participants in public life and also in imitating

	Athens[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in handling the sedition. You are especially deserving of praise because you are restoring their property to the exiles who return; for thus you show and make clear to all that you had expelled them, not because you coveted the property of others, but because you feared for the welfare of the city. Nevertheless, even if you had adopted none of the measures, and had received back no one of the exiles, the restoration of these individuals is to your advantage, I think; for it is disgraceful that while your city is universally acknowledged to be most devoted to music and the most notable artists in that field have been born among you,[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] yet he who is the foremost authority of living men in that branch of culture is an exile from such a city; and that while all other Greeks confer citizenship upon men who are distinguished in any of the noble pursuits, even though they are foreigners, yet you suffer those who are both famous among the other Greeks and share in your own racial origin to live abroad in exile. I marvel that so many cities judge those who excel in the athletic contests to be worthy of greater rewards than those who, by painstaking thought and endeavour, discover some useful thing,[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] and that they do not see at a glance that while the faculties of strength and speed naturally perish with the body, yet the arts and sciences abide for eternity, giving benefit to those who cultivate them.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	But perhaps someone may object, saying that those who wish to obtain a favour should not merely praise the thing, but should also show that they themselves would be justly entitled to that for which they petition. But here is the situation. It is true that I have abstained from political activity and from practising oratory: for my voice was inadequate and I lacked assurance.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] I have not been altogether useless, however, and without repute; on the contrary, you will find that I have been the counsellor and coadjutor of those who have chosen to speak well of you and of our other allies, and that I have myself composed more discourses on behalf of the freedom and independence of the Greeks[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] than all those together who have worn smooth the floor of our platforms. For this you would justly be grateful to me in the highest degree; for you constantly and earnestly desire such a settled policy. And I think that, if Conon and Timotheüs were still alive, and Diophantus[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c] had returned from Asia, they would have supported me most enthusiastically, since they would wish that I might obtain all I request. On this topic I do not know what more I need say; for there is no one among you so young or so forgetful as not to know the benefactions of those great men.

	Do not wonder that I have written this letter with considerable warmth and at some length; for I desire to accomplish two things: not only to do our children a favour, but also to make it clear to them that even if they do not become orators in the Assembly or generals, but merely imitate my manner of life, they will not lead neglected lives among the Greeks. One thing more—if it should seem best to you to grant any of these requests, let Agenor and his brothers understand that it is owing in some measure to me that they are obtaining what they desire.

	[b]Introduction[/b]
	Archidamus III succeeded his father Agesilaus as one of the kings of Sparta. Isocrates had previously written for him, probably in 366 b.c., his Sixth Oration, [c dimgray]Archidamus,[/c] a deliberative speech. He now addresses him in this letter, which, like [c dimgray]Letters[/c] 1 and 6, lacks a conclusion and was, therefore, probably only a preface to a longer discourse on his favourite topic[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]—that Archidamus should lead a united Hellas against Persia.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The date of this letter (356 b.c.) is furnished by Isocrates himself. In § 16 he says that he is eighty years of age. Despite the writer’s statement that he is “altogether worn out,” the communication, although it seems to show signs of hasty composition, is full of life and vigour.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] The evil plight at this time of Hellas as a whole, and of the Greeks dwelling along the seaboard of Asia, is vividly depicted.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The arguments adduced by some scholars to cast doubt upon the authenticity of this letter are without validity.[c dimgray][sup]c[/sup][/c]

	[b]Letter 9. To Archidamus[/b]
	Since I know, Archidamus,[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] that many persons are eager to sing the praises of you, your father, and your family, I have chosen to leave to them that topic, since it would be a very easy one to treat. I myself, however, intend to exhort you to feats of generalship and military campaigns which are in no respect similar to those which are impending now, but, on the contrary, are such as will make you the author of great benefits, not only to your own state, but also to all the Greek world. This is the choice of subject I have made, although I am not unaware which of the two discourses is the easier to deal with; nay, I know perfectly well that to discover actions which are noble, great, and advantageous is difficult and given to few men, whereas to praise your virtues I should have found an easy task. For there would have been no need of deriving from my own resources all that was to be said about them, but in your own past achievements I should have found topics for treatment so many and of such a kind that the eulogies pronounced upon other men would not have rivalled in the slightest degree the praise that I should have lavished upon you. For how could anyone have surpassed in nobility of birth the descendants of Heracles[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c] and Zeus—and all men know that to your family alone confessedly

	belongs this honour—or in valour the founders of the Dorian cities in the Peloponnese who occupied that land, or in the multitude of the perilous deeds and the trophies erected as a result of your leadership and rule? Who would lack material if he wished to recount in full the tale of the courage of your entire state, and of its moderation, and its constitution established by your ancestors? How long a story would be needed to tell of your father’s wisdom, of his handling of affairs in adversity, and of that battle in Sparta[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] in which you, leading a few against many, exposed yourself to danger, and, surpassing all, proved to be the author of your city’s salvation—a deed than which no man could point to one more glorious! For neither capture of cities nor slaughter of a multitude of the enemy is so great and so sublime as the saving of one’s fatherland from perils so dire—and no ordinary fatherland, but one so greatly distinguished for its valour. Any man who should relate these achievements, not in polished style, but simply, and without stylistic embellishment, merely telling the tale of them and speaking in random fashion, could not fail to win renown.

	Now I might have spoken passably about even these matters, since I knew, in the first place, that it is easier to treat copiously in cursory fashion occurrences of the past than intelligently to discuss the future and, in the second place, that all men are more grateful to those who praise them than to those who advise them[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]—for the former they approve

	as being well-disposed, but the latter, if the advice comes unbidden, they look upon as officious—nevertheless, although I was already fully aware of all these considerations, I have refrained from topics which would surely be flattering and now I propose to speak of such matters as no one else would dare to discuss, because I believe that those who make pretensions to fairness and practical wisdom should choose, not the easiest subjects, but the most arduous, nor yet those which are the sweetest to the ears of the listeners, but such as will avail to benefit, not only their own states, but also all the other Greeks.

These armies do damage to only a small part of the domain of the king of Persia, but every Hellenic city they enter they utterly destroy, killing some, driving others into exile, and robbing still others of their possessions[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c]; furthermore, they treat with indignity children and women, and not only dishonour the most beautiful women, but from the others they strip off the clothing which they wear on their persons, so that those who even when fully clothed were not to be seen by strangers, are beheld naked by many men; and some women, clad in rags, are seen wandering in destitution from lack of the bare necessities of life.[c dimgray][sup]b[/sup][/c]

	With regard to this unhappy situation, which has now obtained for a long time, not one of the cities which lays claim to the leadership of the Hellenes has shown indignation, nor has any of its leading men been wroth, except your father. For Agesilaüs alone of all whom we know unceasingly to the end longed to liberate the Greeks and to wage war against the barbarians. Nevertheless, even he erred in one respect. And do not be surprised if I, in my communication to you, mention matters in which his judgement was at fault; for I am accustomed always to speak with the utmost frankness and I should prefer to be disliked for having justly censured than to win favour through having given unmerited praise. My view, then, is as follows: Agesilaus, who had won distinction in all other fields, and had shown himself to be in the highest degree self-controlled, just, and statesmanlike, conceived two strong desires, each of them taken by itself seeming admirable, but being

	incompatible and incapable of achievement at the same time. For he wished not only to wage war on the Persian king but also to restore to their respective cities his friends who were in exile and to establish them as masters of affairs.[c dimgray][sup]a[/sup][/c] The result, therefore, of his exertions on behalf of his friends was that the Greeks were involved in misfortunes and in fighting, and on account of the confusion which prevailed here had not the leisure nor yet the strength to wage war against the barbarians. So, in consequence of the conditions which were at that time not recognized, it is easy to perceive that men of good counsel should not wage war against the king of Persia until someone shall have first reconciled the Greeks with each other and have made us cease from our madness and contentiousness. On these topics I have spoken before and now I intend to discuss them.

	And yet certain persons who, although they have no share at all in learning, yet profess to be able to teach everybody else, and although they dare to find fault with my efforts, yet are eager to imitate them, will perhaps call it madness for me to concern myself with the misfortunes of Greece, as if Greece would be either better or worse off as a result of words of mine! Justly, however, would all men condemn these persons as guilty of great cowardice and meanness of spirit, for while they make pretence to serious intellectual interests, they pride themselves on petty things and consistently show malice and envy against those who have the ability to give counsel concerning matters of the greatest importance. These men, then, in their endeavour to give aid and comfort to their own weaknesses and indolence,

	will perhaps speak in such fashion. I for my part, however, pride myself so greatly on my ability that, even though I am now eighty years of age and altogether worn out, I think it is especially fitting to speak my mind on these matters, and also that I have been well advised in directing my appeal to you, and that it may well be that from my counsel some of the necessary measures will be taken.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And I believe that if the rest of the Greek world also should be called upon to choose from all mankind both the man who by his eloquence would best be able to summon the Greeks to the expedition against the barbarians, and also the leader who would be likely most quickly to bring to fulfilment the measures recognized as expedient, they would choose no others but you and me. Yet surely we should be acting disgracefully, should we not, if we should neglect these duties in which our honour is involved, should all men regard us as worthy of them? My part, it is true, is the smaller; for to declare what one thinks is usually not so very difficult. But for you it is fitting, giving attention to all that I have said, to deliberate upon the question whether you should shrink from the conduct of the affairs of Hellas—you,
	whose noble lineage I have a little while ago described, leader of the Lacedaemonians, addressed by the name King, and a man who enjoys the greatest renown of all the Hellenes—or, disdaining the matters you now have in hand, you should put your hand to greater undertakings.

	I for my part say that, disregarding everything else, you should give your attention to these two tasks—to rid the Hellenes from their wars and from all the other miseries with which they are now
