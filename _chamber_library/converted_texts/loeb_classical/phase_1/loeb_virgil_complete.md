	The evidence of the capital manuscripts [c dimgray]GMPR,[/c] supported by Quintilian, Servius, and others, leaves no doubt that Virgil entitled his first publication [c dimgray]Bucolica[/c] (= [c dimgray]Pastorals[/c]). But pastorals they all are not. The fourth is a political epithalamium; the sixth, the song of Silenus, treats more of cosmology than of shepherding; while the last depicts the grief of the poet Gallus when he was jilted by his mistress. Possibly finding difficulty in giving a label applicable to each item the ancient commentators agreed on the broader and less precise term [c dimgray]Eclogae[/c] (= [c dimgray]Selections[/c]), a term evidently in use for varied pieces, and this title has stuck.

	You, Tityrus, lie under the canopy of a spreading beech, wooing the woodland Muse on slender reed, but we are leaving our country’s bounds and sweet fields. We are outcasts from our country; you, Tityrus, at ease beneath the shade, teach the woods to re-echo “fair Amaryllis.”
	[m1]\ [/m]

	tityrus
	[m1]\ [/m]
	O Meliboeus, it is a god who gave us this peace—for a god he shall ever be to me; often shall a tender lamb from our folds stain his altar. Of his grace my kine roam, as you see, and I, their master, play what I will on my rustic pipe.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	meliboeus
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Well, I grudge you not—rather I marvel; such unrest is there on all sides in the land. See, heartsick, I myself am driving my goats along, and here, Tityrus, is one I scarce can lead. For here just now amid the thick hazels, after hard travail, she dropped twins, the hope of the flock, alas! on the naked flint. Often, I mind, this mishap was foretold me, had not my wits been dull, by the oaks struck from heaven. But still tell me, Tityrus, who is this god of yours?

	The city which they call Rome, Meliboeus, I, foolish one! thought was like this of ours, whither we shepherds are wont to drive the tender younglings of our flocks. Thus I knew puppies were like dogs, and kids like their dams; thus I used to compare great things with small. But this one has reared her head as high among all other cities as cypresses oft do among the bending osiers.

	Freedom, who, though late, yet cast her eyes upon me in my sloth, when my beard began to whiten as it fell beneath the scissors. Yet she did cast her eyes on me, and came after a long time—after Amaryllis began her sway and Galatea left me. For—yes, I must confess—while Galatea ruled me, I had neither hope of freedom nor thought of savings. Though many a victim left my stalls, and many a rich cheese was pressed for the thankless town, never would my hand come home money-laden.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	meliboeus
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I used to wonder, Amaryllis, why so sadly you called on the gods, and for whom you let the apples hang on their native trees. Tityrus was gone from home. The very pines, Tityrus, the very springs, the very orchards here were calling for you!

	What was I to do? I could not quit my slavery nor elsewhere find my gods so ready to aid. Here, Meliboeus, I saw

	Fortunate senex, ergo tua rura manebunt,

	Happy old man! So these lands will still be yours, and large enough for you, though bare stones cover all, and the marsh chokes your pastures with slimy rushes. Still, no strange herbage shall try your breeding ewes, no baneful infection from a neighbour’s flock shall harm them. Happy old man! Here, amid familiar streams and sacred springs, you shall enjoy the cooling shade. On this side, as of old, on your neighbour’s border, the hedge whose willow blossoms are sipped by Hybla’s bees shall often with its gentle hum soothe you to slumber; on that, under the towering rock, the woodman’s song shall fill the air; while still the cooing wood pigeons, your pets, and the turtle dove shall cease not their moaning from the elm tops.

	Sooner, then, shall the nimble stag graze in air, and the seas leave their fish bare on the strand—sooner, each wandering over the other’s frontiers, shall the Parthian in exile drink the Arar, and Germany the Tigris, than that look of his shall fade from my heart.

Nor am I so unsightly; on the shore the other day I looked at myself, when, by grace of the winds, the sea was at peace and still.

Nor would you be sorry to have chafed your lip with a reed; to learn this same art, what did not Amyntas do?

My own hands will gather quinces, pale with tender down, and chestnuts, which my Amaryllis loved. Waxen plums I will add—this fruit, too, shall have its honour. You too, O laurels, I will pluck, and you, their neighbour myrtle, for so placed you blend sweet fragrance.

Let Pallas dwell by herself in the cities she has built; but let my chief delight be the woods! The grim lioness follows the wolf, the wolf himself the goat, the wanton goat the flowering clover, and Corydon follows you, Alexis. Each is led by his liking. See, the bullocks drag home by the yoke the hanging plough, and the retiring sun doubles the lengthening shadows. Yet love still burns in me; for what bound can be set to love?

	Nay, why not at least set about plaiting some thing your need calls for, with twigs and pliant rushes? You will find another Alexis, if this one scorns you.”

	Tell me, Damoetas, who owns the flock? Is it Meliboeus?
	[m1]\ [/m]

	No, but Aegon. Aegon the other day turned it over to me.
	[m1]\ [/m]

	menalcas
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Poor sheep, unlucky all the time! While your master fondles Neaera, and is afraid that she prefers me to him, this hired keeper milks his ewes twice an hour, and the flock are robbed of their strength and the lambs of their milk.

	What can owners do, when thieves are so daring? Didn’t I see you, rascal, trapping Damon’s goat, while his mongrel barked madly? And when I shouted: “Where is that fellow off to? Tityrus, mind your flock!” you were skulking behind the rushes.

	But for you, child, the earth untilled will pour forth its first pretty gifts, gadding ivy with foxglove everywhere, and the Egyptian bean blended with the laughing briar; unbidden it will pour forth for you a cradle of smiling flowers. Unbidden, the goats will bring home their udders swollen with milk, and the cattle will not fear huge lions. The serpent, too, will perish, and perish will the plant that hides its poison; Assyrian spice will spring up on every soil.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But as soon as you can read of the glories of heroes and your father’s deeds, and can know what valour is, slowly will the plains yellow with the waving corn, on wild brambles the purple grape will hang, and the stubborn oak distil dewy honey.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Yet will a few traces of old-time sin live on, to bid men tempt the sea in ships, girdle towns with walls, and cleave the earth with furrows. A second Tiphys will then arise, and a second Argo to carry chosen heroes; a second war will be fought, and great Achilles be sent again to Troy.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Next, when now the strength of years has made you a man, even the trader will quit the sea, nor will the ship of pine exchange wares; every land will bear all fruits. Earth will not suffer the harrow, nor the vine the pruning hook; the sturdy ploughman, too, will now loose his oxen from the yoke. No more will wool be taught to put on varied hues, but of himself the ram in the meadows will change his fleece, now to sweetly blushing purple, now to a saffron

	“Daphnis it was that taught men to yoke Armenian tigers beneath the car, to lead on the dances of Bacchus and entwine in soft leaves the tough spears. As the vine gives glory to its trees, as the grape to the vines, as the bull to the herd, as the corn to rich fields, you alone give glory to your people. Since the Fates bore you off, even Pales has left our fields, and even Apollo. Often in the furrows, to which we entrusted the big barley grains, luckless darnel springs up and barren oat straws. Instead of the soft violet, instead of the gleaming narcissus, the thistle rises up and the sharp-spiked thorn. Strew the turf with leaves, shepherds, curtain the springs with shade—such honours Daphnis charges you to pay him. And build a tomb, and on the tomb place, too, this verse: ‘Daphnis was I amid the woods, known from here even to the stars. Fair was my flock, but fairer I, their shepherd.’”

	“Daphnis, in radiant beauty, marvels at Heaven’s unfamiliar threshold, and beneath his feet beholds the clouds and the stars. Therefore frolic glee seizes the woods and all the countryside, and Pan, and the shepherds, and the Dryad maids. The wolf plans no ambush for the flock, and nets no snare for the stag; kindly Daphnis loves peace. The very mountains, with woods unshorn, joyously fling their voices starward; the very rocks, the very groves ring out the song: ‘A god is he, a god, Menalcas!’ Be kind and gracious to your own! Lo here are four altars—two, see, for you, Daphnis; two for Phoebus! Two cups, foaming with fresh milk, will I year by year set up for you, and two bowls of rich olive oil; and, for my chief care, making the feast merry with wine—in winter, before the hearth; in harvest time, in the shade—I will pour from goblets the fresh nectar of Chian wine. Damoetas and Lyctian Aegon shall sing for me, and Alphesiboeus mimic the dancing Satyrs.

	“These rites shall be yours for ever, both when we pay our yearly vows to the Nymphs, and when we purify our fields. So long as the boar loves the mountaintops, and the fish the streams; so long as the bees feed on thyme and the cicadas on dew—so long shall your honour, name, and glory abide. As to Bacchus and Ceres, so to you, year after year, shall the husbandmen pay their vows; you, too, shall hold them to their vows.”

	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] the Cynthian plucked my ear and warned me: “A shepherd, Tityrus, should feed sheep that are fat, but sing a lay fine-spun.” And now—bards in plenty will you find eager to sing your praises, Varus, and build the story of grim war—now will I woo the rustic Muse on slender reed. Unbidden strains I sing not; still if any there be to read even these my lays—any whom love of the theme has won—’tis of you, Varus, our tamarisks shall sing, of you all our groves.

	Proceed, Pierian maids! The lads Chromis and Mnasyllos saw Silenus lying asleep in a cave, his veins swollen, as ever, with the wine of yesterday. Hard by lay the garlands, just fallen from his head, and his heavy tankard was hanging by its well-worn handle. Falling on him—for oft the aged one had cheated both of a promised song—they cast him into fetters made from his own garlands. Aegle joins their company and seconds the timid pair—Aegle, fairest of the Naiads—and, as now his eyes open, paints his face and brows with crimson mulberries. Smiling at the trick, he cries: “Why fetter me? Loose me, lads; enough that you have shown your power. Hear the songs you crave; you shall have your songs, she another kind of reward.” Therewith the sage begins. Then indeed you might see Fauns and fierce beasts sporting in measured dance, and unbending oaks nodding their crests. Not so does the rock of Parnassus rejoice in Phoebus; not so do Rhodope and Ismarus marvel at their Orpheus.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	For he sang how, through the vast void, the seeds of earth, and air, and sea, and liquid fire withal were gathered together; how from these elements all nascent things, yes all, and even the young globe of the world grew together; how the earth began to harden, to shut off the Sea god in the deep, and little by little to assume the shapes of things; how next the lands are astounded at the new sun shining and how rains fall as the clouds are lifted higher, when first woods begin to arise and here and there living creatures move over mountains that know them not.

	Then he tells of the stones that Pyrrha threw, of Saturn’s reign, of Caucasian eagles, and the theft of Prometheus. To these he adds the tale of the spring where Hylas was left, and how the seamen called on him, till the whole shore echoed “Hylas! Hylas!” Now he consoles
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] Pasiphaë—happy one, if herds had never been!—with her passion for the snowy bull. Ah, unhappy girl, what a madness has gripped you! The daughters of Proetus filled the fields with feigned lowings, yet not one was led by so foul a love for beasts, though each had feared to find the yoke on her neck and often looked for horns on her smooth brow. Ah! unhappy girl, now you roam the hills; he, pillowing his snowy side on soft hyacinths, under a dark ilex chews the pale grass, or courts some heifer in the populous herd. “Close,
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] Nymphs, Nymphs of Dicte, close now the forest glades, if so, perchance, the bull’s truant footsteps may meet my eyes; it may be that, tempted by a green meadow or following the herd, he will be led home by some cows to our Cretan stalls.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then he sings of the maid who marvelled at the apples of the Hesperides; then he encircles Phaëthon’s sisters in moss of bitter bark, and raises them from the ground as lofty alders. Then he sings of Gallus, wandering by the streams of Permessus—how one of the sisterhood led him to the Aonian hills, and how all the choir of Phoebus rose to do him honour; how Linus, a shepherd of immortal song, his locks crowned with flowers and bitter parsley, cried to him thus: “These reeds—see, take them—the Muses give you—even those they once gave the old Ascraean,

	Why tell how he sang of Scylla, daughter of Nisus, of whom is still told the story that, with howling monsters girt about her white waist, she harried the Ithacan barques, and in the swirling depths, alas! tore asunder the trembling sailors with her sea dogs? Or how he told of Tereus’ changed form, what feast, what gifts Philomela made ready for him, on what wise she sped to the desert, and with what wings, luckless one! she first hovered above her home?

	All the songs that of old Phoebus rehearsed, while happy Eurotas listened and bade his laurels learn by heart—these Silenus sings. The re-echoing valleys fling them again to the stars, till Vesper gave the word to fold the flocks and tell their tale, as he set forth over an unwilling sky.

To this place, while I sheltered my tender myrtles from the frost, my he-goat, the lord of the flock himself, had strayed; and I catch sight of Daphnis. As he in turn saw me, “Quick,” he cries, “come hither, Meliboeus; your goat and kids are safe,

	As you would have your swarms shun the yews of Corsica, and your heifers browse on clover and swell their udders, begin, if you have aught to sing. Me, too, the Pierian maids have made a poet; I, too, have songs; me also the shepherds call a bard, but I trust them not. For as yet, methinks, I sing nothing worthy of a Varius or a Cinna, but cackle as a goose

	That’s what I’m about, Lycidas, silently turning it over in my mind, in case I can recall it. And no mean song it is. “Come to me, Galatea! What pleasure lives in waves? Here is rosy spring; here, by the streams, Earth scatters her flowers of a thousand hues; here the white poplar bends over the cave, and the clinging vines weave shady bowers. Come to me; leave the wild waves to lash the shore.”

	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] of Caesar, seed of Dione, has gone forth—the star to make the fields glad with corn, and the grape deepen its hue on the sunny hills. Graft your pears, Daphnis; your children’s children shall gather the fruits you have sown.”

	Time robs us of all, even of memory; oft as a boy I recall that with song I would lay the long summer days to rest. Now I have forgotten all my songs. Even voice itself now fails Moeris; the wolves have seen Moeris first. Still Menalcas will repeat you your songs, often as you will.

Here put down the kids—we shall reach the town all the same. Or if we fear that night may first bring on rain, we may yet go singing on our way—it makes the road less irksome.

	What groves, what glades were your abode, you virgin Naiads, when Gallus was pining with unrequited love? For no heights of Parnassus or of Pindus, no Aonian Aganippe made you tarry. For him even the laurels, even the tamarisks wept. For him, as he lay beneath a lonely rock, even pine-crowned Maenalus wept, and the crags of cold Lycaeus. The sheep, too, stand around—they think no shame of us, and think you no shame of the flock, heavenly poet; even fair Adonis fed sheep beside the streams. The shepherd came, too; slowly the swineherds came; Menalcas came, dripping, from the winter’s mast.
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c] All ask: “Whence this love of yours?” Apollo came. “Gallus,” he said, “what madness this? Your sweetheart Lycoris has followed another amid snows and amid rugged camps.” Silvanus came, with rustic glories on his brow, waving his fennel flowers and tall lilies. Pan came, Arcady’s god, and we ourselves saw him, crimsoned with vermilion and blood-red elderberries. “Will there be no end?” he cried. “Love recks naught of this: neither is cruel Love sated with tears, nor the grass with the rills, nor bees with the clover, nor goats with leaves.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But sadly Gallus replied: “Yet you, Arcadians, will sing this tale to your mountains; Arcadians only know how to sing. How softly then would my bones repose, if in other days your pipes should tell my love! And oh that I had been one of you, the shepherd of a flock of yours, or the dresser of your ripened grapes!

Here are cold springs, Lycoris, here soft meadows, here woodland; here with you, only the passage of time would wear me away. But now a mad passion for the stern god of war keeps me in arms, amid clashing steel and fronting foes; while you, far from your native soil—O that I could but disbelieve such a tale!—gaze, heartless one, on Alpine snows and the frozen Rhine, apart from me, all alone.

No frosts will stay me from surrounding with my hounds the glades of Parthenius. Already I see myself traversing rocks and echoing groves; it is a joy to shoot the Cretan shaft from my Parthian bow! As if this could heal my frenzy, or as if that god could learn pity for human sorrows! Once more Hamadryads and even songs have lost their charms for me; once more farewell, even ye woods!

	The Greek title (= [c dimgray]Farming[/c]) was not an original one. It had been borne by, among others, a didactic poem of Nicander no longer extant, which Virgil doubtless knew and probably used, as he used his [c dimgray]Theriaca.[/c] But his debt is unlikely to have been great.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Some idea of the meticulous attention to detail shown by Virgil in this, his most finished work, may be gathered from the four references to his patron Maecenas, one in each book: in the first and last the bare vocative of his name is placed in the second verse; in the second and third in the forty-first (perhaps on line 1 of his second page), an unobtrusive and almost perfunctory compliment scarcely on the same plane as his invocation of Octavian in 1.24ff.

	Zephyr’s touch, even then would I have my bull groan over the deep-driven plough, and the share glisten when rubbed by the furrow. That field only answers the covetous farmer’s prayer which twice has felt the sun and twice the frost; from it boundless harvests burst the granaries. And ere our iron cleaves an unknown plain, be it first our care to learn the winds and the wavering moods of the sky, the wonted tillage and nature of the ground, what each clime yields and what each disowns. Here corn, there grapes spring more luxuriantly; elsewhere young trees shoot up, and grasses unbidden. See you not, how Tmolus sends us saffron fragrance, India her ivory, the soft Sabaeans their frankincense; but the naked Chalybes give us iron, Pontus the strong-smelling beaver’s oil, and Epirus the Olympian victories of her mares? From the first, Nature laid these laws and eternal covenants on certain lands, even from the day when Deucalion threw stones into the empty world, whence sprang men, a stony race. Come then, and where the earth’s soil is rich, let your stout oxen upturn it straightway, in the year’s first months, and let the clods lie for dusty summer to bake with her ripening suns; but should the land not be fruitful, it will suffice, on the eve of Arcturus’ rising, to raise it lightly with shallow furrow—in the one case, that weeds may not choke the gladsome corn; in the other, that the scant moisture may not desert the barren sand.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In alternate seasons you will also let your fields lie fallow after reaping, and the plain idly stiffen with scurf; or, beneath another star, sow yellow corn in lands whence you have first carried off the pulse that rejoices in its quivering pods, or the fruits of the slender vetch, or the brittle stalks and rattling tangle of the bitter lupine.

	parches the ground; oats parch it, and poppies, steeped in Lethe’s slumber. Yet by changing crops the toil is light: only be not ashamed to feed fat the dried-out soil with rich dung, and to scatter grimy ashes over the exhausted fields. Thus also, with change of crop, the land finds rest, and meanwhile not thankless is the unploughed earth. Often, too, it has been useful to fire barren fields, and burn the light stubble in crackling flames; whether it be that the earth derives thence hidden strength and rich nutriment, or that in the flame every taint is baked out and the useless moisture sweats from it, or that that heat opens fresh paths and loosens hidden pores, by which the sap may reach the tender blades, or that it rather hardens the soil and narrows the gaping veins, that so the searching showers may not harm, or the blazing sun’s fierce tyranny wither it, or the North Wind’s piercing cold.

	Much service does he do the land who with the mattock breaks up the sluggish clods, and drags over it hurdles of osier; nor is it without reward that golden Ceres looks on him from Olympian heights.

	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] Down it falls, and waking a hoarse murmur amid the smooth stones, slakes the thirsty soil with its gushing stream.

	leaves, hid fire from view, and stayed the wine that once ran everywhere in streams, so that experience, from taking thought, might little by little forge all manner of skills, seeking in ploughed furrows the blade of corn, striking forth the spark hidden in the veins of flint. Then first did rivers feel upon their backs boats of hollowed alder, then the mariner grouped and named the stars, Pleiads and Hyads and Lycaon’s daughter, the radiant Bear. Then was discovered how to catch game with traps, snare birds with lime, and how to encircle vast coverts with hunting dogs. Already one man is lashing a broad stream with his casting net, seeking the bottom, while another trawls through the sea his dripping meshes. Then came unyielding iron and the blade of the rasping saw (for primitive man used wedges to cleave wood until it split), and art followed hard on art. Toil triumphed over every obstacle, unrelenting Toil, and Want that pinches when life is hard.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Ceres was the first to teach men to turn the earth with iron, when the acorns and the arbutes of the sacred wood began to fail, and Dodona withheld her food. Soon, too, on the corn fell trouble, the baneful mildew feeding on the stems, and the lazy thistle bristling in the fields; the crops die, and instead springs up a prickly growth of burs and caltrops, and amid the smiling corn luckless darnel and barren oats hold sway. Therefore, unless your hoe is ever ready to assail the weeds, your voice to terrify the birds, your knife to check the shade over the darkened land, and your prayers to invoke the rain, in vain, poor man, you will gaze on your neighbour’s large store of grain, and you will be shaking oaks in the woods to assuage your hunger.

	I must tell, too, of the hardy farmers’ weapons, without which the crops could be neither sown nor raised. First the share and the curved plough’s heavy frame, the slow-rolling wains of the Mother
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] of Eleusis, sledges and drags, and hoes of cruel weight; further, the common wicker ware of Celeus, arbute hurdles and the mystic fan of Iacchus. All of these you will remember to provide and store away long beforehand, if the glory the divine country gives is to be yours in worthy measure. From the first, even in the woods, an elm, bent by main force, is trained for the stock, and receives the form of the crooked plough. To the stem of this is fitted a pole, eight feet in length, with two mould boards, and a share beam with double back. A light linden, too, is felled beforehand for the yoke, and a tall beech for the handle,
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] to turn the car below from the rear; and the wood is hung above the hearth for the smoke to season.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	I can repeat for you many olden maxims, unless you shrink back and are loath to learn such trivial cares. And chiefly, the threshing floor must be levelled with a heavy roller, kneaded with the hand, and made solid with binding clay, lest weeds spring up, or, crumbling into dust, it gape open, and then divers plagues make mock of you. Often under the ground the tiny mouse sets up a home and builds his storehouses, or sightless moles dig out chambers; in holes may be found the toad, and all the countless pests born of the earth; or the weevil ravages a huge heap of grain, or the ant, fearful of a destitute old age.

Many a sower have I seen treat his seeds, drenching them first with nitre and black oil lees, that the deceitful pods might yield larger produce, and the grains be sodden quickly, however small the fire. I have seen seeds, though picked long and tested with much pains, yet degenerate, if human toil, year after year, culled not the largest by hand. Thus by law of fate all things speed towards the worse and slipping away fall back; even as if one, whose oars can scarce force his skiff against the stream, should by chance slacken his arms, and lo! headlong down the current the channel sweeps it away.

	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] pass from your sight in the morn, and let the Cretan star of the blazing Crown
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c] withdraw ere you commit to the furrows the seeds due, or hasten to trust the year’s hope to a reluctant soil. Many have begun ere Maia’s setting, but the looked-for crop has mocked them with empty straws. Yet if you choose to sow the vetch or homely kidney bean, and scorn not the care of Egyptian lentil, setting Boötes will send you no doubtful signs. Begin, and carry on your sowing to midwinter’s frosts.

	beneath our feet, is seen of black Styx and the shades infernal. Here, with his tortuous coils, the mighty Snake glides forth, river-like, about and between the two Bears—the Bears that shrink from the plunge beneath Ocean’s plain. There, men say, is either the silence of lifeless night, and gloom ever thickening beneath night’s pall; or else Dawn returns from us and brings them back the day, and when on us the rising Sun first breathes with panting steeds, there glowing Vesper is kindling his evening rays. Hence, though the sky be fitful, we can foretell the weather’s changes, hence the harvest tide and sowing time; when it is meet to lash with oars the sea’s faithless calm, when to launch our well-rigged fleet, or in the woods to fell the pine in season. Not in vain do we watch the signs, as they rise and set, and the year, uniform in its four several seasons.

	Whenever a cold shower keeps the farmer indoors, he can prepare at leisure much that ere long in clear weather must needs be hurried. The ploughman hammers out the hard tooth of the blunted share, scoops troughs from trees, or sets a brand upon his flocks and labels upon his corn heaps.
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] Others sharpen stakes and two-pronged forks, or make bands of Amerian willows for the limber vine. Now let the pliant basket be woven of briar twigs, now roast corn by the fire, now grind it on the stone. Even on holy days, the laws of God and man permit you to do certain tasks. No scruples ever forbade us to guide down the rills,

	parched ears. Strip to plough, strip to sow; winter is the farmer’s lazy time. In cold weather farmers chiefly enjoy their gains, and feast together in merry companies. Winter’s cheer calls them, and loosens the weight of care—even as when laden keels have at last reached port, and the merry sailors have crowned the poops with garlands. Still, then is the time to strip the acorns and laurel berries, the olive and blood-red myrtle; the time to set snares for cranes and nets for the stag, and to chase the long-eared hares; the time to smite the does, as you whirl the hempen thongs of a Balearic sling—when the snow lies deep, when the rivers roll down the ice.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Why need I tell of autumn’s changes and stars, and for what our workers must watch, as the day now grows shorter and summer softer, or when spring pours down in showers, as the bearded harvest now bristles in the fields, and the corn on its green stem swells with milk? Often, when the farmer was bringing the reaper into his golden fields and was just beginning to strip the barley from the frail stalk, I have seen all the winds close in conflict, tearing up the heavy corn far and wide from its deepest roots and tossing it on high; so in a black whirlwind did the storm sweep away the light straw and flying stubble. Often, too, there appears in the sky a mighty column of waters, and clouds mustered from on high roll up a murky tempest of black showers: down falls the lofty heaven, and with its deluge of rain washes away the gladsome crops and the labours of oxen. The dykes fill, the deep-channelled rivers swell and roar, and the sea steams in its heaving friths. The Father himself, in the midnight of storm clouds, wields his

At that shock the mighty earth shivers; far flee the beasts and all over the world prostrating terror lays low men’s hearts: he with blazing bolt dashes down Athos or Rhodope or the Ceraunian peaks. The winds redouble; more and more thickens the rain; now woods, now shores wail with the mighty blast. In fear of this, mark the months and signs of heaven; whither Saturn’s cold star withdraws itself and into what circles of the sky strays the Cyllenian fire.

Then lambs are fat and wine is most mellow; then sweet is sleep, and thick are the shadows on the hills. Then let all your country folk worship Ceres; for her wash the honeycomb with milk and soft wine, and three times let the luck-bringing victim pass round the young crops, while the whole choir of your comrades follow exulting, and loudly call Ceres into their homes; nor let any put his sickle to the ripe corn, ere for Ceres he crown his brows with oaken wreath, dance artless measures, and chant her hymns.

Then, too, the wave scarce keeps itself from the curved keel, when the fleet gulls fly back from mid-ocean, wafting their screams shoreward, and when the sea coots sport on dry land, and the heron quits its home in the marsh and soars aloft above the clouds. Often, too, when wind is threatening, you will see stars shoot headlong from the sky and behind them long trails of flame, gleaming white amid night’s blackness; often light chaff and falling leaves fly about and feathers dance as they float on the water’s top. But when it lightens from the region of the grim North, and when the home of the East and West winds thunders, then the ditches overflow and all the fields are flooded, while on the deep every mariner furls his dripping sails. Never has rain brought ill to men unwarned. Either, as it gathers, the skyey cranes flee before it in the valleys’ depths; or the heifer looks up to heaven, and with open nostrils snuffs the breeze, or the twittering swallow flits round the pools, and in the mud the frogs croak their immemorial plaint.

Then the villainous raven with deep tones calls down the rain, and in solitary state stalks along the dry sea sand.

Not now do the halcyons, the pride of Thetis, spread their wings on the shore to catch the warm sun, nor do the uncleanly swine think of tossing straw bundles to pieces with their snouts. But the mists are prone to seek the valleys, and rest on the plain, and the owl, as she watches the sunset from some high peak, vainly plies her evening song. Nisus is seen aloft in the clear sky, and Scylla suffers for the crimson lock. Wherever she flees, cleaving the light air with her wings, lo! savage and ruthless, with loud whirr Nisus follows through the sky; where Nisus mounts skyward, she flees in haste, cleaving the light air with her wings. Then the rooks, with narrowed throat, thrice or four times repeat their soft cries, and oft in their

	high nests, joyous with some strange, unwonted delight, chatter to each other amid the leaves. Glad are they, the rains over, to see once more their little brood and their sweet nests. Not, methinks, that they have wisdom from on high, or from Fate a larger foreknowledge of things to be; but that when the weather and fitful vapours of the sky have turned their course, and Jove, wet with the south winds, thickens what just now was rare, and makes rare what now was thick, the phases of their minds change, and their breasts now conceive impulses, other than they felt when the wind was chasing the clouds. Hence that chorus of the birds in the fields, the gladness of the cattle, and the exulting cries of the rooks.

	But if you pay heed to the swift sun and the moons, as they follow in order, never will tomorrow’s hour cheat you, nor will you be ensnared by a cloudless night. Soon as the moon gathers her returning fires, if she encloses a dark mist within dim horns, a heavy rain is awaiting farmers and seamen. But if over her face she spreads a maiden blush, there will be wind; as wind rises, golden Phoebe ever blushes. But if at her fourth rising—for that is our surest guide—she pass through the sky clear and with un-dimmed horns, then all that day, and the days born of it to the month’s end, shall be free from rain and wind; and the sailors, safe in port, shall pay their vows on the shore to Glaucus, and to Panopea, and to Melicerta, Ino’s son.

Or when at dawn scattered shafts break out amid thick clouds, or when Aurora rises pale, as she leaves Tithonus’ saffron couch, ah! poorly then will the vine leaf guard the ripe grapes, so thick the bristling hail dances rattling on the roofs. This, too, when he has traversed the sky and now is setting, it will profit you more to bear in mind; for often we see fitful hues flit over his face: a dark hue threatens rain, a fiery hue, east winds; but if the spots begin to mingle with glowing fire, then shall you see all nature rioting with wind and storm clouds alike. On such a night let none urge me to travel on the deep, or pluck my cable from the land. Yet if, both when he brings back the day, and when he closes the day he brought, his disc is bright, then vain will be your fear of storm clouds, and you will see the woods sway in the clear north wind.

He and no other warns us when dark uprisings threaten, when treachery and hidden wars are gathering strength. He and no other was moved to pity Rome on the day that Caesar died, when he veiled his radiant face in gloom and darkness, and a godless age feared everlasting night.

How oft before our eyes did Etna deluge the fields of the Cyclopes with a torrent from her burst furnaces, hurling thereon balls of fire and molten rocks. Germany heard the noise of battle sweep across the sky and, event without precedent, the Alps rocked with earthquakes. A voice boomed through the silent groves for all to hear, a deafening voice, and phantoms of unearthly pallor were seen in the falling darkness. Horror beyond words, beasts uttered human speech; rivers stood still, the earth gaped open; in the temples ivory images wept for grief, and beads of sweat covered bronze statues. King of waterways, the Po swept whole forests along in the swirl of his frenzied current, carrying with him over the plain cattle and stalls alike. Nor in that same hour did sinister filaments cease to appear in ominous entrails or blood to flow from wells or our hillside towns to echo all night with the howl of wolves. Never fell more lightning from a cloudless sky; never was comet’s alarming glare so often seen. So it was that Philippi beheld for a second time
	[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c] Roman armies clash in the shock of matching arms; and Heaven above did not demur at Macedon and the broad Balkan plains being twice glutted with the blood of our fellow citizens. Yes, and a time will come when in those lands the farmer, as he cleaves the soil with his curved plough, will find javelins corroded with rusty mould, or with his heavy hoe will strike empty helmets, and marvel at gigantic bones in the upturned graves.

	[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c]Virgil probably meant the [c dimgray]second[/c] battle of Philippi, fought on October 23, 42 b.c., about three weeks after the first (indecisive) engagement. But even in the Augustan age some, Ovid and Manilius, for example, understood him as locating the battle of Pharsalus (48 b.c.) on the same spot (the road distance between each is about 200 miles), and this fiction became a topos with the poets (see Postgate on Lucan 7.872).

For here are right and wrong inverted; so many wars overrun the world, sin walks in so many shapes; respect for the plough is gone; our lands, robbed of the tillers, lie waste, and curved pruning hooks are forged into straight blades. Here Euphrates, there Germany, calls to arms; breaking the covenants which bind them, neighbouring cities draw the sword; the god of unholy strife rages throughout the world, even as when from the starting gates the chariots stream forth and gather speed lap by lap, while the driver, tugging vainly at the reins, is carried along by his steeds, and the car heeds not the curb!

	Firstly, Nature has manifold ways for rearing trees. For some, under no man’s constraint, spring up of their own free will, and far and wide claim the plains and winding rivers; such as the limber osier and lithe broom, the poplar, and the pale willow beds with silvery leafage. But some spring from fallen seed, as tall chestnuts, and the mast tree, monarch of the woodland, that spreads its shade for Jove, and the oaks, deemed by the Greeks oracular. With others a dense undergrowth sprouts from the parent root, as with cherries and elms; the laurel of Parnassus, too, springs up, a tiny plant, beneath its mother’s mighty shade. These are the modes Nature first ordained; these give verdure to every kind of forest trees and shrubs and sacred groves.

	Others there are which Experience has in her course discovered for herself. One man tears away suckers from the mother’s tender frame, and sets them in furrows; another buries in the ground stems, both as cross-cleft shafts and as sharp-pointed stakes. Some trees await the arches of the bent layer, and slips set while yet quick in their own soil; others need no root, and the pruner fears not to take the topmost spray and again entrust it to the earth. When the trunks are cleft—how wondrous the tale!—an olive root thrusts itself from the dry wood. Often, too, we see one tree’s branches turn harmless into another’s, the pear transformed bearing engrafted apples, and stony cornels blushing on the plum.

And you, Maecenas, my pride, my justest title to fame, come and traverse with me the toilsome course I have essayed, and spread your sails to speed over an open sea.

	readily follow any lessons you would have them learn. So, too, the sucker, which springs barren from the bottom of the stem, would do likewise, if set out amid open fields: as it is, the mother tree’s branches and deep leafage overshadow it, robbing it of fruit as it grows, and blasting it in the bearing. Again, the tree which rears itself from chance-dropped seeds rises slowly and will yield its shade to our children of later days; its fruits, too, degenerate, forgetting their olden flavour, and the vine bears sorry clusters, for the birds to pillage.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	On all, be sure, must labour be spent; all must be marshalled into trenches, and tamed with much trouble. But olives answer best from truncheons, vines from layers, Paphian myrtles from the solid stem. From suckers spring sturdy hazels, and the giant ash, the shady tree that crowned Hercules, and the acorns of the Chaonian sire. So, too, rises the lofty palm, and the fir that will see the perils of the deep. But the rough arbutus is grafted with a walnut shoot, and barren planes have oft borne hardy apple boughs; the beech has grown white with the chestnut’s snowy bloom, the ash with the pear’s; and swine have crunched acorns beneath the elm.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Nor is the mode of grafting and of budding the same. For where the buds push out from amid the bark, and burst their tender sheaths, a narrow slit is made just in the knot; in this from an alien tree they insert a bud, and teach it to grow into the sappy bark. Or, again, knotless boles are cut open, and with wedges a path is cleft deep into the core; then fruitful slips are let in, and in a little while, lo! a

	Nor yet can all soils bear all fruits. In rivers grow willows, in rank fens alders, on rocky hills the barren ash. The shores rejoice most in myrtle groves. Lastly, Bacchus loves open hills, and the yew tree the cold of the North Wind. See, too, earth’s farthest bounds, conquered by tillage—the Arabs’ eastern homes, and the painted Gelonians: trees have their allotted climes. India alone bears black ebony; to the Sabaeans alone belongs the frankincense bough. Why should I tell you of the balsams that drip from the fragrant wood, or of the pods of the ever blooming acanthus?

Media bears the tart juices and lingering flavour of the health-giving citron tree, which, if cruel stepdames have ever drugged the cups [c dimgray]mixing herbs and baleful spells,[/c] comes as help most potent, and from the limbs drives the deadly venom. The tree itself is large, and in looks very like a bay; and a bay it were, did it not fling abroad another scent. In no winds fall its leaves; its blossom clings most firmly; with it the Mede treats his mouth’s noisome breath, and cures the asthma of the old.

	But neither Media’s groves, land of wondrous wealth, nor beauteous Ganges, nor Hermus, whose mud is gold, may rival the glories of Italy—not Bactra nor India, no, not all Araby, though its very sand be incense. Never was our country
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] ploughed by fire-snorting bulls for the sowing of the grisly dragon’s teeth; nor have its fields bristled with the helms and serried lances of warriors. But the land was filled with teeming crops and Bacchus’ Massic juice; it is the home of the olive, the home of fattened flocks. Hence comes the war horse which proudly prances over the plain, hence the milk-white herds of the Clitumnus, and the bull, noblest of victims, which, bathed often in its sacred stream, have escorted Roman triumphs to the shrines of the gods. Here spring is perpetual, and summer extends to months other than her own; twice a year the cows calve, twice a year the trees serve us fruit. Here are no ravening tigers or savage brood of lion; no aconite deceives the wretch who picks it, nor yet, sweeping huge coils along the ground, does the scaly snake with his vast train wind himself into a spiral. Count, too, those many stately cities, monument to human toil, and all the towns built by man’s hand on rocky crags with rivers gliding beneath their immemorial walls. Shall I tell of the sea that washes Italy’s shores above and that which breaks on her coasts below?
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] Or tell of her mighty lakes? Of you, Larius, the greatest, or you, Benacus, who swell with a sea’s surge and roar? Shall I tell of her harbours, and the barrier thrown across the Lucrine, and how Ocean clamours aloud in anger, where

First, then, churlish ground and unkindly hills, where there is lean clay, and gravel in the thorny fields, delight in Minerva’s grove of the long-lived olive. A token of this is the oleaster, springing up freely in the same space, and the ground strewn with its wild berries.

	But if your business is rather the keeping of herds and calves, or breeding sheep, or goats that blight the plants, then haste to the glades and distant meads of rich Tarentum, or to such a plain as unhappy Mantua lost, giving food to snowy swans with its grassy stream.

	Land that is black, and rich beneath the share’s pressure and with a crumbly soil—for such a soil we try to rival with our ploughing—is, in the main, best for corn; from no other land will you see more wagons wending homeward behind slow bullocks; or land from which the angry ploughman has carried off the timber, levelling groves that have idled many a year, and tearing up by their deepest roots the olden homes of the birds—these leave their nests and seek the sky, but forthwith the untried plain glistens under the driven ploughshare. For as to the hungry gravel of a hilly country, it scarce serves the bees with lowly spurge and rosemary; and the rough tufa and the chalk that black water snakes have eaten out betoken that no other lands give serpents food so sweet, or furnish such winding coverts.

	if it drinks in moisture and throws it off again at will, if it always clothes itself in the verdure of its own grass, and harms not the steel with scurf and salt rust, that is the one to wreathe your elms in joyous vines, the one to be rich in oil of olive, the one you will find, as you till, to be indulgent to cattle and submissive to the crooked share. Such is the soil rich Capua ploughs, and the coast near the Vesuvian ridge, and Clanius, unkindly to forlorn Acerrae.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now I will tell you how you may distinguish each. If you shall ask whether a soil be light or closer than is the wont—for one is friendly to corn, the other to the vine; the closer to Ceres, all the lightest to Lyaeus—you must first look out a place and bid a pit be sunk deep in the solid ground, then put all the earth back again, and tread the earth level at the top. If it fall short, this farm land will be light, and better suited for the herd and gracious vine; but if it shows that it cannot return to its place, and if there is earth to spare when the pit is filled, the soil is stiff: look for reluctant clods and stiffness of ridge, and have strong oxen break your ground. As for salty land, the kind called bitter (unfruitful it is for crops and mellows not in ploughing; it preserves not for the vine its lineage, or for apples their fame), it will allow this test: pull down from the smoky roof your closewoven wicker baskets and wine strainers: in these let that sorry soil, mixed with fresh spring water, be pressed in to the brim. You will see all the water trickle through and big drops pass between the osiers; but the taste will tell its tale full plainly, and with its bitter flavour will distort the testers’

	soured mouths. Again, richness of soil we learn in this way only: never does it crumble when worked in the hands, but like pitch grows sticky in the fingers when held. A moist soil rears taller grass and is of itself unduly prolific. Ah! not mine be that over-fruitful soil, and may it not show itself too strong when the ears are young! A heavy soil betrays itself silently by its own weight; so does a light one. It is easy for the eye to learn at once a black soil and the hue of any kind. But to detect the villainous cold is hard; only pitch pines or baleful yews and black ivy sometimes reveal its traces.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	These points observed, remember first to bake the ground well, to cut up the huge knolls with trenches, and to expose the upturned clods to the North wind, long before you plant the vine’s gladsome stock. Fields of crumbling soil are the best; to this the winds see, the chill frosts, and the stout delver, who loosens and stirs the acres. But men whose watchful care nothing escapes first seek out like plots—one where the crop may be nursed in infancy for its supporting trees, and one to which it may be moved anon when planted out, lest the nurslings should fail to recognize the mother suddenly changed. Nay, they print on the bark of the trees the quarter of the sky each faced, so as to restore the position in which they stood, the same side bearing the southern heat and the same back turned to the north pole; so strong is habit in tender years.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	First inquire whether it be better to plant the vine on hills or on the plain. If it is rich level ground you lay out, plant close; in close-planted soil not less fertile is the wine god. But if it is a soil of rising mounds and sloping hills, give

As oft, in mighty warfare, when the legion deploys its companies in long array and the column halts on the open plain, when the lines are drawn out, and far and wide all the land ripples with the gleam of steel, not yet is the grim conflict joined, but the war god wanders in doubt between the hosts: so let all your vineyard be meted out in even and uniform paths, not merely that the view may feed an idle fancy, but because only thus will the earth give equal strength to all, and the boughs be able to reach forth into free air.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Perchance you ask also what should be the trenches’ depth. I should venture to entrust a vine even to a shallow furrow, but deeper and far within the earth is sunk the supporting tree, above all the great oak, which strikes its roots down towards the nether pit as far as it lifts its top to the airs of heaven. Hence no winter storms, no blasts or rains, uproot it; unmoved it abides, and many generations, many ages of men it outlives, letting them roll by while it endures. Stout limbs, too, and arms it stretches far, this side and that, itself in the centre upholding a mass of shade.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Let not your vineyards slope towards the setting sun, nor plant the hazel among the vines, nor lop the highest sprays, nor pluck cuttings from the treetop—so strong is their love of the earth—nor hurt young plants with a blunted knife, nor engraft wild trunks of olive. For oft from thoughtless shepherds falls a spark, which, lurking at first unseen under the rich bark, fastens on the trunk, and,

When this befalls, the trees are without virtue in their stock, and when cut down cannot revive or from the earth’s depths resume their olden bloom: the luckless oleaster with bitter leaves alone survives.

	And let no counsellor seem so wise as to persuade you to stir the stiff soil when the North Wind blows. Then winter grips the land with frost, and when the plant is set suffers it not to fasten its frozen root in the earth. The best planting season for vines is when in blushing spring the white bird,
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] the foe of long snakes, is come, or close on autumn’s first cold, while the hot sun does not as yet touch winter with his car, and summer now is waning. Spring it is that clothes the glades and forests with leaves, in spring the soil swells and craves the vital seed. Then does Heaven, sovereign father, descend in fruitful showers into the womb of his joyful consort and, mightily mingling with her mighty frame, gives life to every embryo within. Then secluded thickets echo with melodious birdsong and at the trysting hour the herds renew their loves; the bounteous earth prepares to give birth, and the meadows ungirdle to the Zephyr’s balmy breeze; the tender moisture avails for all. The grass safely dares to face the nascent suns, nor does the vine tendril fear the South Wind’s rising or showers launched from the skies by the blustering North, but puts

	And when their early youth has fresh leaves budding, you must spare their weakness, and while the shoot, speeding through the void with loosened reins, pushes joyously skyward, you must not yet attack the plants themselves with the knife’s edge, but with bent fingers pluck the leaves and pick them here and there. Later, when they have shot up and their stout stems have now clasped the elms, then strip their locks and clip their arms—before they shrink from the knife—then at last set up an iron sway and check the flowing branches.

	You must also weave hedges, and keep out all cattle, chiefly while the leafage is tender and knows naught of trials, for besides unfeeling winters and the sun’s tyranny, ever do wild buffaloes and pestering roes make sport of it; sheep and greedy heifers feed upon it. No cold, stiff with hoar frost, no summer heat, brooding heavily over parched crags, has done it such harm as the flocks and the venom of their sharp tooth, and the scar impressed on the deepgnawed stem. For no other crime is it that a goat is slain to Bacchus at every altar, and the olden plays

	and laughter unrestrained, and put on hideous masks of hollow cork, and call on you, Bacchus, in joyous songs, and to you hang waving amulets from the tall pine. Hence every vineyard ripens in generous increase; fullness comes to hollow valleys and deep glades, and every spot towards which the god has turned his comely face. Duly, then, in our country’s songs we will chant for Bacchus the praise he claims, bringing him cakes and dishes; the doomed hegoat, led by the horn, shall stand at the altar, and the rich flesh we will roast on spits of hazel.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There is, too, this other task of dressing the vines whereon never is enough care taken; for thrice or four times each year must all your soil be split open, and the clods broken unceasingly with hoe reversed, and all the grove lightened of its foliage. The farmer’s toil returns, moving in a circle, as the year rolls back upon itself over its own footsteps. And already, whenever the vineyard has shed her autumn leafage, and the North Wind has shaken their glory from the woods—already then the keen farmer extends his care to the coming year, and pursues the vine he had left, lopping it with Saturn’s crooked knife and pruning it into shape. Be the first to dig the ground, first to bear away and fire the prunings, first to carry the poles under cover: be the last to reap. Twice the shade thickens on the vines; twice weeds cover the vineyard with thronging briars. Heavy is either toil: “Give praise to large estates, farm a small one.”
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] Further, rough shoots of broom must be cut amid the woods, and river rushes on the banks, and the care of the wild willow bed keeps you at work. Now the

	Olives, on the other hand, need no tending; they look not for the crooked knife or gripping mattock, when once they have laid hold of the fields and braved the breeze. Earth of herself, when opened with the hoe’s curved fang, yields moisture enough for the plants, and teeming fruits, when opened by the plough. After this mode nurture the plump olive, favoured of Peace.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Fruit trees, too, so soon as they feel their stems firm, and come to their strength, swiftly push forth skyward with inborn force, needing no help from us. No less, meanwhile, does every wood grow heavy with fruit, and the birds’ wild haunts blush with crimson berries. Cattle browse on the cytisus, the high wood yields pine brands, the fires of night are fed and pour forth light. [c dimgray]And can men be slow to plant and bestow care?[/c] Why need I pursue greater themes?
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c] The willows and lowly broom—they either yield leafage for the sheep or shade for the shepherd, a fence for the crops and food for honey. And what joy it is to gaze on Cytorus waving with boxwood, and on groves of Narycian pitch! What joy to view fields that owe no debt to the harrow, none to the care of man! Even the barren woods on Caucasian peaks, which angry eastern gales ever toss and tear, yield products, each after its kind, yield useful timber, pines for ships, cedars and cypresses for houses.

The willow’s wealth is in its osiers, the elm’s in its leaves, but the myrtle and the cornel, that weapon of war, abound in stout spear shafts; yews are bent into Ituraean bows. So, too, smooth lindens and the box, polished by the lathe, take shape and are hollowed by the sharp steel. So, too, the light alder, launched upon the Po, swims the raging stream; so, too, the bees hive their swarms in the hollow cork-trees, and in the heart of a rotting ilex. What boon of equal note have the gifts of Bacchus yielded? Bacchus has even given occasion of offence. It was he who quelled in death the maddened Centaurs, Rhoetus, and Pholus, and Hylaeus, as he aimed his massive flagon at the Lapiths.

Him no honours the people give can move, no purple worn by despots, no strife which leads brother to betray brother; untroubled is he by Dacian incursion swooping down from a Danube leagued in war, untroubled by Rome’s policies spelling doom to kingdoms; if he has not felt pity for the poor, he has never envied the rich.

	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and you, woods and streams of Lycaeus. Other themes, which else had charmed with song some idle fancy, are now all trite. Who knows not pitiless Eurystheus, or the altars of detested Busiris? Who has not told of the boy Hylas, of Latona’s Delos, of Hippodame, and Pelops, famed for ivory shoulder, and fearless with his steeds? I must essay a path whereby I, too, may rise from earth and fly victorious on the lips of men. I first, if life but remain, will return to my country, bringing the Muses with me in triumph from the Aonian peak; first I will bring back to you, Mantua, the palms of Idumaea, and on the green plain will set up a temple in marble beside the water, where great Mincius wanders in lazy windings and fringes his banks with slender reeds.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] In the midst I will have Caesar, and he shall possess the shrine. In his honour I, a victor resplendent in Tyrian purple, will drive a hundred four-horse chariots beside the stream. For me all Greece will leave Alpheus
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and the groves of Molorcus,
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] to compete in the foot race and with the brutal boxing glove. My

	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] and the arms of conquering Quirites; there, too, the Nile in flood and billowing with war, and lofty columns clad with the bronze prows of hostile fleets. I will add Asia’s vanquished cities, the routed Niphates,

	Whether a man aspires to the prize of Olympia’s palm and breeds horses, or rears bullocks, strong for the plough, let his chief care be to choose the mould of the dams. The best-formed cow is fierce looking, her head ugly, her neck thick, and her dewlaps hanging down from chin to legs. Moreover, her long flank has no limit; all points are large, even the feet; and under the crooked horns are shaggy ears. Nor should I dislike one marked with white spots, or impatient of the yoke, at times fierce with the horn, and more like a bull in face; tall throughout, and as she steps sweeping her footprints with the tail’s tip. The age to bear motherhood and lawful wedlock ends before the tenth year, and begins after the fourth; the rest of their life is neither fit for breeding nor strong for the plough. Meantime, while lusty youth still abides in the herds, let loose the males; be first to send your cattle to mate, and supply stock after stock by breeding. Life’s fairest days are ever the first to flee for hapless mortals; on creep diseases, and gloomy age, and suffering; and stern death’s ruthlessness sweeps us away. Ever will there be some cows whose mould you would wish to change; ever, I pray, renew them, and, lest too late you regret your losses, keep in advance, and year by year choose new stock for the herd.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Likewise for your breed of horses is the same choice needed. Only, upon those whom you mean to rear for the hope of the race, be sure to spend special pains, even from their early youth. From the first, the foal of a noble breed steps higher in the fields and brings down his feet lightly. Boldly he leads the way, braves threatening rivers, entrusts

	himself to an untried bridge, and starts not at idle sounds. His neck is high, his head clean-cut, his belly short, his back plump, and his gallant chest is rich in muscles. Good colours are bay and grey; the worst, white and dun. Again, should he but hear afar the clash of arms, he cannot keep his place; he pricks up his ears, quivers in his limbs, and snorting rolls beneath his nostrils the gathered fire. His mane is thick and, as he tosses it, falls back on his right shoulder. A double ridge runs along his loins; his hoof scoops out the ground, and the solid horn gives it a deep ring. Such was Cyllarus, tamed by the reins of Amyclaean Pollux, and those whose fame Greek poets recount, the two steeds of Mars,
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] and the pair of the great Achilles.
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] Such, too, was Saturn himself, when at his wife’s

	Yet even such a steed do you shut up in the stalls when he begins to fail, worn with disease or burdened with years; and pity not his inglorious old age, though oft he has driven the foe in flight and claims Epirus or valiant Mycenae for his birthplace, and traces his line to Neptune himself for founder.
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] The aged stallion is cold to passion, and he vainly struggles with a thankless task; when he comes to the fray his ardour is futile—as when a great fire rages in the stubble, but there is no strength in it.

	and the stock of their sires, the grief each shows at defeat or the pride in victory. See you not, when in headlong contest the chariots have seized upon the plain, and stream in a torrent from the barrier, when the young drivers’ hopes are high, and throbbing fear drains each bounding heart? On they press with circling lash, bending forward to slacken rein; fiercely flies the glowing wheel. Now sinking low, now raised aloft, they seem to be borne through empty air and to soar skyward. No rest, no stay is there; but a cloud of yellow sand mounts aloft, and they are wet with the foam and the breath of those in pursuit: so strong is their love of renown, so dear is triumph. Erichthonius first dared to couple four steeds to the car, and to stand victorious over the flying wheels. The Thessalian Lapiths, mounting the horse’s back, gave us the bit and circling course, and taught the horseman, in full armour, to gallop over the earth and round his proud paces. Equal is either task;
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] equally the trainers seek out a young steed, hot of spirit and keen in the race.

	These points noted, they bestir themselves, as the time draws near, and take all heed to fill out with firm flesh him whom they have chosen as leader and assigned as lord of the herd. They cut him flowering grasses, and give fresh water and corn, that he may be more than equal to the seductive toil, and no feeble offspring may repeat the leanness of the sires. But the mares themselves they purposely make spare, and when now the familiar pleasure first prompts them to union, they withhold leafy fodder and debar

Oft, too, they rouse them to the gallop and tire them in the sun, when the floor groans heavily as the corn is threshed, and the empty chaff is tossed to the freshening Zephyr. This they do that by surfeit the usefulness of the fruitful soil be not dulled, or the sluggish furrows clogged, but that it may thirstily seize upon the seed, and store it deep within.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	In turn, care for the sires begins to wane, and that for the dams to take its place. When their months are fulfilled and they roam heavy with young, then let no one suffer them to draw the yokes of heavy wagons, or leap across the pathway, or scour the meadows in swift flight, or stem the swirling current. They feed them in open glades and by the side of brimming rivers, where moss grows and the banks are greenest with grass, where grottoes may shelter them and the shadow of a rock be cast afar. Round the groves of Silarus and the green holm oaks of Alburnus swarms a fly, whose Roman name is [c dimgray]asilus,[/c] but the Greeks have called it in their speech [c dimgray]oestrus.[/c]

	After birth, all care passes to the calves, and at once they brand them with the mark and name of the stock, setting apart those they wish to rear for breeding, to keep sacred for the altar, to set to cleave the soil and turn up the field, rough with its broken clods. The rest of the cattle

	graze in the green pastures; but school while yet calves those that you will shape for the farm’s pursuits and service; enter on the path of training while their youthful spirits are docile, while their age is still pliant. And, first, fasten about their shoulders loose circles of slender osier; then when their free necks are used to servitude, yoke the bullocks in pairs linked from the collars themselves,
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c] and force them to step together. Then let them now draw empty carts often over the land, and print their tracks on the surface of the dust. Later, let the beechen axle creak and strain under its heavy load and a brass-bound pole drag the coupled wheels. Meanwhile you will not feed their unbroken youth on grass alone or poor willow leaves and marshy sedge, but on young corn, plucked by hand; nor will your mother-cows fill the snowy pails, as in our fathers’ days, but will spend all their udders’ wealth on their dear offspring.

	But if your bent is more towards war and proud squadrons, or to glide on wheels by Pisa’s Alphean waters, and in Jupiter’s grove
	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] to drive the flying car, then the steed’s first task is to view the arms of gallant warriors, to bear the trumpet call, to endure the groaning of the dragged wheel, and to hear the jingle of bits in the stall; then more and more to delight in his trainer’s caressing praise, and to love the sound of patting his neck. And this let him venture, soon as he is weaned from his mother, and now and again let him entrust his mouth to soft halters, while still weak and trembling, still ignorant of life. But when three summers

	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] and be as one hard labouring: then, then let him challenge the winds to a race, and, skimming over the open plains, as though free from reins, let him scarce plant his steps on the surface of the sand—as when the gathered North Wind swoops down from Hyperborean coasts, driving on Scythia’s storms and dry clouds, then the deep cornfields and the watery plains quiver under the gentle gusts, the treetops rustle, and long rollers press shoreward; on flies the wind, sweeping in his flight the fields and seas alike. Such a horse will either sweat towards the Elean goal, over the vast courses of the plain, and fling from his mouth bloody foam, or will bear more nobly with docile neck the Belgian car. Then at last, when the colts are now broken, let their bodies wax plump with coarse mash; for ere the breaking they will raise their mettle too high, and when caught will scorn to submit to the pliant lash, or obey the cruel curb.

	But no care so strengthens their powers as to keep from them desire and the stings of secret passion, whether one’s choice is to deal with cattle or with horses. Therefore men banish the bull to lonely pastures afar, beyond a mountain barrier and across broad rivers, or keep him well mewed beside full mangers. For the sight of the female slowly inflames and wastes his strength, nor, look you, does she, with her soft enchantments, suffer him to remember woods or pastures; oft she drives her proud lovers to settle their mutual contest with clash of horns.

	Sila’s great forest, a lovely heifer: the bulls in alternate onset join battle with mighty force; many a wound they deal, black gore bathes their frames, amid mighty bellowing the levelled horns are driven against the butting foe; the woods and the sky, from end to end, re-echo. Nor is it the rivals’ wont to herd together, but the vanquished one departs, and dwells an exile in unknown scenes afar. Much does he bewail his shame, and the blows of his haughty conqueror, and much the love he has lost unavenged—then, with a wistful glance at his stall, he has quitted his ancestral realm. Therefore with all heed he trains his powers, and on an unstrewn couch, among flinty rocks, lies through the night, with prickly leaves and pointed sedge for fare. Anon he tests himself, and, learning to throw wrath into his horns, charges a tree’s trunk; he lashes the winds with blows, and paws the sand in prelude for the fray. Soon, when his power is mustered and his strength renewed, he advances the colours, and dashes headlong on his unmindful foe: as, when a wave begins to whiten in mid-sea, from the farther deep it arches its curve, and, rolling shoreward, roars thundering along the reefs, and, huge as a very mountain, falls prone, while from below the water boils up in eddies, and tosses black sand aloft.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Every single race on earth, man and beast, the tribes of the sea, cattle and birds brilliant of hue, rush into fires of passion: all feel the same Love. At no other season does the lioness forget her cubs, or prowl over the plains more fierce; never does the shapeless bear spread death and havoc so widely through the forest; then savage is the boar,

	then most fell the tigress. Ah! it is ill faring then in Libya’s lonely fields! See you not how a trembling thrills through the steed’s whole frame, if the scent has but brought him the familiar breezes? No longer now can the rider’s rein or the cruel lash stay his course, nor rocks and hollow cliffs, nay, nor opposing rivers, that tear up mountains and hurl them down the wave. On rushes the great Sabine boar; he whets his tusks, his foot paws the ground in front, he rubs his sides against a tree, and on either flank hardens his shoulders against wounds. What of the youth, in whose marrow fierce Love fans the mighty flame? Lo! in the turmoil of bursting storms, late in the black night, he swims the straits. Above him thunders Heaven’s mighty portal, and the billows, dashing on the cliffs, echo the cry; yet neither his hapless parent can call him back, nor thought of the maiden doomed to die on his untimely corpse.

	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] and the fierce tribe of wolves and dogs? What of the battles fought by peaceful stags? But surely the madness of mares surpasses all. Venus herself inspired their frenzy, when the four Potnian steeds tore with their jaws the limbs of Glaucus. Love leads them over Gargarus and over the roaring Ascanius; they scale mountains, they swim rivers. And, soon as the flame has stolen into their craving marrow (chiefly in spring, for in spring the heat returns to their breasts), they all, with faces turned to the Zephyrs, stand on a high cliff, and drink in the gentle breezes. Then oft, without any wedlock, pregnant with the wind (a wondrous tale!) they flee over rocks

	But time meanwhile is flying, flying beyond recall, while we, charmed with love of our theme, linger around each detail!

And well I know how hard it is to win with words a triumph herein, and thus to crown with glory a lowly theme.

From them is a larger progeny, from them a plenteous store of milk; the more the milk pail has foamed from the drained udder, the more richly will flow the streams, when again the teats are pressed. Nor less, meanwhile, do herdsmen clip the beard on the hoary chin of the Cinyphian goat, and shear his hairy bristles, for the need of camps, and as coverings for hapless sailors. Again, they feed in the woods and on the summits of Lycaeus among the prickly briars and the hill-loving brakes; and of themselves they are mindful to return home, leading their kids, and scarce able to overtop the threshold with their teeming udders. Therefore, the less they need man’s care, the more zealously should you screen them from frost and snowy blasts, gladly bringing them their food and provender of twigs, and closing not your hay lofts throughout the winter.

Then, when heaven’s fourth hour has brought thirst to all, and the plaintive cicadas thrill the thickets with song, I will bid the flocks at the side of wells or deep pools drink of the water that runs in oaken channels.

	Why follow for you in song the shepherds of Libya, their pastures, and the settlements where they dwell in scattered huts? Often, day and night, and a whole month through, the flocks feed and roam into the desert stretches, with no shelters; so vast a plain lies outstretched. The African herdsman takes with him his all—his house and home, his arms, his Spartan dog and Cretan quiver
	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c]—even as the valiant Roman, when, arrayed in his country’s arms, he hastes on his march under a cruel load, and, ere the foe awaits him, halts his column and pitches his camp.

	Far otherwise is it where dwell the tribes of Scythia by the waters of Maeotis, where the turbid Danube tosses his yellow sands, and where Rhodope bends back, stretching up to the central pole. There they keep the herds penned up in stalls, and no blade is seen upon the plain, or leaf upon the tree; but far and wide earth lies shapeless under mounds of snow and piles of ice, rising seven cubits high. ’Tis ever winter; ever Northwest blasts, with icy breath. Then, too, never does the Sun scatter the pale mists, either when, borne on his chariot, he climbs high heaven, or when he laves his headlong car in Ocean’s crimson plain. Sudden ice crusts form on the running stream, and anon the water bears on its surface iron-bound wheels—giving

	welcome once to ships, but now to broad wains! Everywhere brass splits, clothes freeze on the back, and with axes they cleave the liquid wine; whole lakes turn into a solid mass, and the rough icicle hardens on the unkempt beard. No less, meanwhile, does the snow fill the sky; the cattle perish, the oxen’s great frames stand sheathed in frost, the deer in crowded herd are numb under the strange mass and above it scarce rise the tips of their horns. These they hunt not by unloosing hounds, or laying nets, or alarming with a scare of the crimson feather,
	[c dimgray][sup]26[/sup][/c] but as their breasts vainly strain against that mountain rampart men slay them, steel in hand, cut them down bellowing piteously, and bear them home with loud shouts of joy. Themselves, in deep-dug caves, low in the earth, they live careless and at ease, rolling to the hearths heaps of logs, whole elm trees, and throwing them on the fire. Here they spend the night in play, and with barm and sour service berries
	[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c] joyously mimic draughts of wine. Such is the race of men lying under the Wain’s seven stars in the far north, a wild race, buffeted by the Riphaean East Wind, their bodies clothed in the tawny furs of beasts.

	But let him who longs for milk bring with his own hand lucerne and lotus in plenty and salted herbage to the stalls. Thus they love streams the more, and the more distend their udders, while their milk recalls a lurking savour of salt. Many bar the kids from the dams as soon as born, and from the first front their mouths with iron-bound muzzles. What milk they drew at sunrise or in the hours of day, they press into cheese at night; what they drew at night or sunset, they press at dawn: they ship it in baskets which a shepherd takes to town, or else they salt it sparingly and put it by for the winter.

Snatch up in your hand, shepherd, snatch stones and staves, and as he rises in menace and swells his hissing neck, strike him down! Lo, now in flight he has buried deep his frightened head, while his mid coils and the end of his writhing tail are still untwining themselves, and the last curve slowly drags its folds. There is, too, that deadly serpent
	[c dimgray][sup]30[/sup][/c] in Calabria’s glades, wreathing its scaly back, its breast erect, and its long belly mottled with large spots. So long as any streams gush from their founts, so long as earth is wet with spring’s moisture and showery south winds, he haunts the pools, and, dwelling on the banks, there greedily fills his black maw with fish and croaking frogs. But when the fen is burnt up, and the soil gapes with heat, he springs forth to dry land and, rolling his blazing eyes, rages in the fields, fierce with thirst and frenzied with the heat. Let me not then be tempted to woo soft sleep beneath the open sky, or to lie outstretched in the grass on some wooded slope, when, his slough cast off, fresh and glistening in youth, he rolls along, leaving his young or eggs at home, towering towards the sun, and darting from his mouth a three-forked tongue!

Or, after shearing, they smear the body with bitter oil lees, blending silver scum and native sulphur with pitch from Ida and richly oiled wax, squill, strong hellebore, and black bitumen. Yet no help for their ills is of more avail than when one has dared to cut open with steel the ulcer’s head; the mischief thrives and lives by concealment, while the shepherd refuses to lay healing hands on the wounds, and sits idle, calling upon the gods for happier omens. Nay more, when the pain runs to the very marrow of the bleating victims, there to rage, and when the parching fever preys on the limbs, it is well to turn aside the fiery heat, and within the hoof to lance a vein, throbbing with blood, even as the Bisaltae are wont to do, and the keen Gelonian, when he flees to Rhodope and the wilds of the Getae, and there drinks milk curdled with horses’ blood. Should you see a sheep oft withdraw afar into soft shade, or listlessly nibble the top of the grass, lagging in the rear, or sink while grazing in the midst of the field and retire, late and lonely, before night’s advance, straightway with the knife check the offence, ere the dread taint spreads through the unwary throng. Not so thick with driving gales sweeps a whirlwind from the sea, as scourges swarm among cattle. Not single victims do diseases seize, but a whole summer’s fold in one stroke, the flock and the hope of the flock, and the whole race, root and branch.

	On this land from the sickened sky there once came a piteous season that glowed with autumn’s full heat. Every tribe of cattle, tame or wild, it swept to death; it poisoned the lakes, it tainted the pastures with venom. Nor was the pathway to death uniform;
	[c dimgray][sup]31[/sup][/c] but when the fiery thirst had coursed through all the veins and shrivelled the hapless limbs, in its turn a watery humour welled up and drew into itself all the bones, as piecemeal they melted with disease. Often in the midst of divine rites, the victim, standing by the altar, even as the woollen fillet’s snowy band was passed round its brow, fell in death’s throes amid the tardy ministrants. Or if, before that, the priest had slain a victim with the knife, yet the altars blazed not therewith, as the entrails were laid on; the seer, when consulted, could give no response; the knife beneath the throat is scarce stained with blood, and only the surface sand is darkened with the thin gore. Then on every side amid gladsome herbage the young cows die or yield up sweet life by their full folds. Then madness visits fawning hounds; a racking cough shakes the sickening swine and chokes them with swollen throats. The steed, once victor, sinks; failing in his efforts and forgetful of the grass, he turns from the spring, and beats the ground repeatedly with his hoof; his ears droop, on them breaks out a fitful sweat—sweat that is cold as death draws nigh; the skin is dry and, hard to the touch, withstands the stroking hand. Such are the signs they yield

	before death in the first days; but as in its course the sickness grows fierce, then the eyes blaze, the breath is drawn deep—at times laden with moans—their utmost flanks are strained with long-drawn sobs, black blood gushes from the nostrils, and the rough tongue chokes the blockaded throat. It has availed to pour in wine-juice through a horn inserted—this seemed the one hope for the dying. Soon even this led to death; they burned with the fury of fresh strength, and, though now in the weakness of death (Heaven grant a happier lot to the good, and such madness to our foes!), rent and mangled their own limbs with bared teeth.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But lo, the bull, smoking under the ploughshare’s weight, falls; from his mouth he spurts blood, mingled with foam, and heaves his dying groans. Sadly goes the ploughman, unyokes the steer that sorrows for his brother’s death, and amid its half-done task leaves the share rooted fast. No shades of deep woods, no soft meadows can touch his heart, no stream purer than amber, rolling over the rocks in its course towards the plain; but his flanks are unstrung throughout, numbness weighs upon his languid eyes, and his neck sinks with drooping weight to earth. Of what avail is his toil or his services? What avails it, that he turned with the share the heavy clod? And yet no Massic gifts of Bacchus, no feasts, oft renewed, did harm to him and his. They feed on leaves and simple grass; their cups are clear springs and rivers racing in their course, and no care breaks their healthful slumbers.

	Only at that time, they say, were cattle in those regions sought in vain for the rites of Juno, and chariots were drawn by ill-matched buffaloes to her lofty treasure

	[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c] Therefore men painfully scratch the earth with harrows, with their own nails bury the seed, and over the high hills with straining necks drag the creaking wains. The wolf tries not his wiles around the sheepfold, nor prowls by night about the flocks; a keener care tames him. Timorous deer and shy stags now stray among the hounds and about the houses. Yea, the brood of the great deep, and all swimming things, like shipwrecked corpses, are washed up by the waves on the verge of the shore; in strange wise sea calves flee to the rivers. The viper, too, vainly defended in her winding lairs, perishes, and the water snake, his scales erect in terror. The air is unkind even to the birds; headlong they fall, leaving life beneath the clouds on high. Further, even change of pasture avails no more; the remedies sought work harm; masters in the art fail, Chiron, son of Phillyra, and Melampus, Amythaon’s son. Ghastly Tisiphone rages, and, let forth into light from Stygian gloom, drives before her Disease and Dread, while day by day, uprising, she rears still higher her greedy head. The rivers and thirsty banks and sloping hills echo to the bleating of flocks and incessant lowing of cattle. And now in droves she deals out death, and in the very stalls piles up the bodies, rotting with putrid foulness, till men learn to cover them in earth and bury them in pits. For neither might the hides be used, nor could one cleanse the flesh by water or master it by fire. They could not even shear the

	Next will I discourse of Heaven’s gift, the honey from the skies. On this part, too, of my task, Maecenas, look with favour. The wondrous pageant of a tiny world—chiefs great-hearted, a whole nation’s character and tastes and tribes and battles—I will in due order to you unfold. Slight is the field of toil; but not slight the glory, if adverse powers leave one free, and Apollo hearkens unto prayer.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	First seek a settled home for your bees, whither the winds may find no access—for the winds let them not carry home their food—where no ewes or sportive kids may trample the flowers, nor straying heifer brush off the dew from the mead and bruise the springing blade. Let the spangled lizard with his scaly back be also a stranger to the rich stalls, and the bee-eater and other birds, and Procne,
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] with breast marked by her blood-stained hands. For these spread havoc far and near, and, while the bees are on the wing, carry them off in their mouths, a sweet morsel for their cruel nestlings. But let clear springs be near, and moss-green pools, and a tiny brook stealing through the grass; and let a palm or huge wild olive shade the porch, so that, when the new kings lead forth the early swarms in the spring they love, and the youth revel in their freedom from

In the midst of the water, whether it stand idle or flow onward, cast willows athwart and huge stones, that they may have many bridges whereon to halt and spread their wings to the summer sun, if haply the East Wind has sprinkled the loiterers or with swift gust has plunged them in the flood. All about let green cassia bloom, and wild thyme with fragrance far borne, and a wealth of strong-scented savory; and let violet beds drink of the trickling spring.

	Then, let the hive itself, whether it be sewn of hollow bark, or woven of pliant osier, have its entrances narrow; for winter with its cold congeals the honey, while heat thaws and makes it run. Either trouble is alike to be feared for the bees; nor is it with vain zeal that in their homes they smear the tiny crevices with wax, fill the entrances with paste from flowers, and keep a store of glue, gathered for this very purpose, more binding than lime or the pitch of Phrygian Ida. Often, too, if report be true, they have made a snug home in tunnelled hiding places underground, and are found deep in the hollows of pumice rock, or the cavern of a decayed tree. Yet keep them snug, smearing the chinks of their chambers with smooth clay, and flinging thereon a few leaves. And suffer no yew too near the hive, nor roast the reddening crab at your hearth; and trust not a deep marsh or a place where the smell of mud is strong, or where the hollow rocks ring when struck, and the echoed voice rebounds from the shock.

	the sky, straightway they range through glades and groves, cull bright flowers, and lightly sip the stream’s brink. Hence it is that, glad with some strange joy, they cherish nest and nestlings; hence they deftly mould fresh wax and fashion the gluey honey. Hence when you look up and see the host, just freed from the hive, floating towards the starry sky through the clear summer air—when you marvel at the dark cloud trailing down the wind—mark it well; they are ever in quest of sweet waters and leafy coverts. Here scatter the scents I prescribe—bruised balm, and the honeywort’s lowly herb; raise a tinkling sound, and shake the Mighty Mother’s cymbals round about.

Then, all afire, they flock together: their wings flash, they sharpen their stings with their beaks
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] and make ready their arms. Round their king, and even by his royal tent, they swarm in throngs, and with loud cries challenge the foe. Therefore, when they have found a clear spring day and open field, they sally forth from the gates. There is a clash; in high air arises a din; they are mingled and massed in one great

In the midst of the ranks the chiefs themselves, with resplendent wings, have mighty souls beating in tiny breasts, ever steadfast not to yield, until the victor’s heavy hand has driven these or those to turn their backs in flight.

As twofold are the features of the kings, so are the bodies of the subjects. For some are ugly and unsightly, as when from out of deep dust comes the parched wayfarer, and spits the dirt from his dried mouth. Others gleam, and flash in splendour, their bodies all ablaze and flecked with equal drops of gold. This is the nobler breed; from this, in the sky’s due season, you will strain sweet honey—yet not so sweet as clear, and fit to subdue the harsh flavour of wine.

	In fact, were I not, with my task well-nigh done, about to furl my sails and making haste to turn my prow to land, perchance I might sing what careful tendance clothes rich gardens in flower, and might sing of Paestum whose rose beds bloom twice yearly, how the endive rejoices in drinking streams, the verdant banks in celery; how the cucumber, coiling through the grass, swells into a paunch. Nor should I have passed in silence the late-flowering narcissus, the twining tendril of the acanthus, pale ivy sprays, or the shore-loving myrtle. For I call to mind how once under the towers of the Oebalian citadel,
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] where dark Galaesus waters the yellowing corn, I saw an old Cilician, who occupied a few acres of unclaimed land, not rich enough for ploughing, nor fit for pasturage, nor suited to the vine. Even so, planting cabbages here and there among the brambles, and white lilies and vervain and fine-seeded poppies, in happiness he equalled the wealth of kings, and returning home late at night he used to load his table with an unbought banquet. First he was in the spring to gather roses, and apples in the fall; and when grim winter was still

	bursting rocks with her frost and braking the current of rivers with ice, already he was cutting soft-haired hyacinths and chiding laggard summer and the loitering zephyrs. Thus it was that he was still the first to be enriched with teeming bees and a plenteous swarm, and first to gather from the squeezed comb the frothing honey; his limes and laurestines were ever luxuriant, and all the fruits which clothed his fertile trees in their early blossoming, so many they kept in the ripeness of autumn. He would also plant out elms in rows, though late in season, pears when quite hard, blackthorns already hung with sloes, and planes already offering to drinkers the service of their shade.

	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] They alone have children in common, hold the dwellings of their city jointly, and pass their life under the majesty of law. They alone know a fatherland and fixed home, and in summer, mindful of the winter to come, spend toilsome days and garner their gains into a common store. For some watch over the gathering of food, and under fixed covenant labour in the fields; some, within the confines of their homes, lay down the narcissus’ tears and gluey gum from tree bark as the first foundation of the

To some it has fallen by lot to be sentries at the gates, and in turn they watch the rains and clouds of heaven, or take the load of incomers, or in martial array drive the drones, a lazy herd, from the folds. All aglow is the work, and the fragrant honey is sweet with thyme. And as, when the Cyclopes in haste forge bolts from tough ore, some with oxhide bellows make the blasts come and go, others dip the hissing brass in the lake, while Aetna groans under the anvils laid upon her; they, with mighty force, now one, now another, raise their arms in measured cadence, and turn the iron with gripping tongs—even so, if we may compare small things with great, an inborn love of gain spurs on the Attic bees, each after its own office. The aged have charge of the towns, the building of the hives, the fashioning of the cunningly wrought houses. But the young betake them home in weariness, late at night, their thighs freighted with thyme; far and wide they feed on arbutus, on pale-green willows, on cassia and ruddy crocus, on the rich linden, and the dusky hyacinth. All have one season to rest from labour, all one season to toil. At dawn they pour from the gates—no loitering; again, when the star of eve has warned them to withdraw from their pasture in the fields, then they seek their homes, then they refresh their frames; a sound is heard, as they hum about the entrances and on the thresholds. Anon, when they have laid them to rest in their chambers, silence reigns into the night, and well-earned sleep seizes their weary limbs. Nor yet, if rain impend, do they

	stray far from their stalls, or trust the sky when eastern gales are near, but round about, beneath the shelter of their city walls, draw water, and essay short flights; and often they raise tiny stones, as unsteady barques take up ballast in a tossing sea, and with these balance themselves amid the unsubstantial clouds. Often, too, as they wander among rugged rocks they bruise their wings, and freely yield their lives under their load—so deep is their love of flowers and their glory in begetting honey.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	You will also marvel that this custom has found favour with bees, that they indulge not in conjugal embraces, nor idly unnerve their bodies in love, or bring forth young with travail, but of themselves
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] gather their children in their mouths from leaves and sweet herbs, of themselves provide a new monarch and tiny burghers, and remodel their palaces and waxen realms. Therefore, though the limit of a narrow span awaits the bees themselves—for it never stretches beyond the seventh summer—yet the race abides immortal, for many a year stands firm the fortune of the house, and grandsires’ grandsires are numbered on the roll.

	Moreover, neither Egypt nor mighty Lydia, nor the Parthian tribes, nor Median Hydaspes, show such homage to their king. While he is safe, all are of one mind; when he is lost, straightway they break their fealty, and themselves pull down the honey they have reared and tear up their trellised combs. He is the guardian of their toils; to him they do reverence; all stand round him in clamorous crowd, and attend him in throngs. Often they lift him on

	Led by such tokens and such instances, some have taught that the bees have received a share of the divine intelligence, and a draught of heavenly ether;
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] for God, they saw, pervades all things, earth and sea’s expanse and heaven’s depth; from him the flocks and herds, men and beasts of every sort draw, each at birth, the slender stream of life; to him all beings thereafter return, and, when unmade, are restored; no place is there for death, but, still quick, they fly unto the ranks of the stars, and mount to the heavens aloft.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Whenever you would break into the close-packed dwelling and the honey hoarded in their treasure houses, first with a draught of water sprinkle and rinse your mouth, and in your hand hold forth searching smoke. Their rage is beyond measure; when hurt, they breathe poison into their bites, and fastening on the veins leave there their unseen stings and lay down their lives in the wound. Twice they gather the teeming produce; two seasons are there for the harvest—first, so soon as Taygete the Pleiad
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] has shown her comely face to the earth, and spurned with scornful foot the streams of Ocean, and when that same star, fleeing before the sign of the watery Fish, sinks sadly from heaven into the wintry waves. But if you fear a rigorous winter, and

For often the newt, unnoticed, has nibbled at the combs, the light-shunning beetles cram the chambers, and the unhelpful drone seats him at another’s board. Or the fierce hornet has rushed upon their unequal forces, or the moths appear, a pestilent race, or the spider, hateful to Minerva, hangs in the doorway her loose-woven nets. The more their hoards are drained, the more eagerly will they press on to repair the ruin of their fallen race, filling up their cell galleries and weaving their granaries with flower gum.

	But, since to bees as well has life brought the ills of man, if their bodies droop with a grievous disease—and this you can at once discern by no uncertain signs: straightway, as they sicken, their colour changes, an unsightly leanness mars their looks; forth from their doors they bear the bodies of those bereft of life, and lead the mournful funeral train; or else, linked foot to foot, there by the portal they hang, or within locked doors they linger, all spiritless with hunger and torpid with pinching cold. Then is heard a duller sound, a long-drawn buzz, as at times the chill South sighs in the woods, as the fretted sea whistles with its ebbing surge, as seethes in close-barred furnaces the devouring flame. Then would I have you burn forthwith fragrant gum, and give them honey through pipes of reed, freely heartening them, and calling the weary to their familiar food.

A flower, too, there is in the meadows, which farmers have called [c dimgray]amellus,[/c] a plant easy for searchers to find, for from a single clump it lifts a vast growth. Golden is the disk, but in the petals, streaming profusely round, there is a crimson gleam amid the dark violet. Often with its woven garlands have the gods’ altars been decked; its flavour is bitter to the tongue; shepherds cull it in meadows cropped by the flock, and by Mella’s winding streams.

	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] presses close and the rushing river splits up into seven separate mouths after sweeping all the way down from the swarthy Indians
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] and with its black sands fertilizes verdant Egypt, there the whole region rests its sure hope of salvation upon this device.

	First is chosen a place, small and straitened for this very purpose. This they confine with a narrow roof of tiles and close walls, and towards the four winds add four windows with slanting light. Then a bullock is sought, one just arching his horns on a brow of two summer’s growth. Struggle as he will, both his nostrils are stopped up, and the breath of his mouth; then he is beaten to death, and his flesh is pounded to a pulp through the unbroken hide. As thus he lies, they leave him in his prison, and strew beneath his sides broken boughs, thyme, and fresh cassia. This is done when the zephyrs begin to stir the waves, before ever the meadows blush with their fresh hues, before the chattering swallow hangs her nest from the rafters. Meantime the moisture, warming in the softened bones, ferments, and creatures of wondrous wise to view, footless at first, soon with buzzing wings as well, swarm together, and more and more essay the light air, until, like a shower pouring from summer clouds, they burst forth, or like arrows from the string’s rebound, when the light-armed Parthians enter on the opening battle.

	What god, ye Muses, forged for us this device? Whence did man’s strange adventuring take its rise? Aristaeus the shepherd, quitting Tempe by the Peneus, when—so runs the tale—his bees were lost through sickness and hunger, sorrowfully stopped beside the sacred fount at the stream’s head, and with much complaint called on his mother thus: “O mother, mother Cyrene, who dwell in this flood’s depths, why, from the gods’ glorious line—if indeed, as you say, Thymbraean Apollo is my father—did you give me

And while, charmed by the strain, they unrolled the soft coils from their spindles, again the wail of Aristaeus smote upon his mother’s ear, and all upon their crystal thrones were startled.

	To her the mother, her soul smitten with strange dread, cries: “O bring him, bring him to us; lawful it is for him to tread the threshold divine.” And withal, she bade the deep streams part asunder far, that so the youth might enter in. And lo, the wave, arched mountain-like, stood round about, and, welcoming him within the vast recess, ushered him beneath the stream. And now, marvelling at his mother’s home, a realm of waters, at the lakes locked in caverns, and the echoing groves, he went on his way, and, dazed by the mighty rush of waters, he gazed on all the rivers, as, each in his own place, they glide under the great earth
	[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c]—Phasis and Lycus, the fount whence deep Enipeus first breaks forth, whence Father Tiber, whence the streams of Anio and rocky, roaring Hypanis, and Mysian Caïcus, and Eridanus, on whose bull’s brow
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] are two gilded horns: no other stream of mightier force flows through the fertile fields to join the violet sea. Soon as he reached the bower with its hanging roof of stone, and Cyrene heard the tale of her son’s idle tears, the sisters, in due order, pour on his hands clear spring-waters, and bring smooth-shorn napkins. Some load the board with the feast, and in turn set on the brimming cups; the altars

	“In Neptune’s Carpathian flood there dwells a seer, Proteus, of sea-green hue, who traverses the mighty main in his car drawn by fishes and a team of two-footed steeds. Even now he revisits the havens of Thessaly and his native Pallene. To him we Nymphs do reverence, and aged Nereus himself; for the seer has knowledge of all things—what is, what hath been, what is in train before long to happen—for so has it seemed good to Neptune, whose monstrous herds and unsightly seals he pastures beneath the wave. Him, my son, you must first take in fetters, that he may unfold to you all the cause of the sickness, and bless the issue. For without force he will give you no counsel, nor shall you bend him by prayer. With stern force and fetters make fast the captive; thereon alone his wiles will shatter themselves in vain. I myself, when the sun has kindled his noonday heat, when the grass is athirst, and the shade is now welcome to the flock, will guide you to the aged one’s retreat, whither when weary he retires, so that you may assail him with ease as he lies asleep. But when you hold him in the grasp of hands and fetters, then will manifold forms baffle you, and figures of wild beasts. For of a sudden he will become a bristly boar, a deadly tiger, a

	She spoke, and shed abroad ambrosia’s fragrant stream, wherewith she steeped her son’s whole frame: and lo, a sweet effluence breathed from his smoothened locks, and vigour and suppleness passed into his limbs. There is a vast cavern, hollowed in a mountain’s side, whither many a wave is driven by the wind, then separates into receding inlets—at times a haven most sure for storm-caught mariners. Within, Proteus shelters himself with the barrier of a huge rock. Here the Nymph stations the youth in ambush, away from the light; she herself, veiled in a mist, stands aloof. And now the Dog Star, fiercely parching the thirsty Indians, was ablaze in heaven, and the fiery Sun had consumed half his course; the grass was withering and the hollow streams, in their parched throats, were scorched and baked by the rays down to the slime, when Proteus came from the waves, in quest of his wonted cave. About him the watery race of the vast deep gambolled, scattering afar the briny spray. The seals lay them down to sleep, here and there along the shore; he himself—even as at times the warder of a sheepfold on the hills, when Vesper brings the steers home from pasture, and the cry of bleating lambs whets the wolf’s hunger—sits down on a rock in the midst

Soon as the chance came to Aristaeus, he scarce suffered the aged one to settle his weary limbs, before he burst upon him with a loud cry and surprised him in fetters as he lies. On his part, the seer forgets not his craft, but changes himself into all wondrous shapes—into flame and hideous beast and flowing river. But when no stratagem wins escape, vanquished he returns to himself, and at last speaks with human voice: “Why, who,” he cried, “most presumptuous of youths, bade you invade our home? Or what seek you hence?” But he: “You know, Proteus; you know of yourself, nor may one deceive you in aught, but give up your wish to deceive. Following the counsel of Heaven, we are come to seek hence an oracle for our weary fortunes.” So much he spoke. On this the seer, yielding at last to mighty force, rolled on him eyes ablaze with grey-green light, and, grimly gnashing his teeth, thus opened his lips to tell of fate’s decrees:

He even passed through the jaws of Taenarum, the lofty portals of Dis, the grove that is murky with black terror, and made his way to the land of the dead with its fearful king and hearts no human prayers can soften. Stirred by his song, up from the lowest realms of Erebus came the insubstantial shades, the phantoms of those who lie in darkness, as many as the myriads of birds that shelter among the leaves when evening or a wintry shower drives them from the hills—women and men, and figures of great-souled heroes, their life now done, boys and girls unwed, and sons placed on the pyre before their fathers’ eyes. But round them are the black ooze and unsightly reeds of Cocytus, the unlovely mere enchaining them with its sluggish water, and Styx holding them fast within his ninefold circles. Still more: the very house of Death and deepest abysses of Hell were spellbound, and the Furies with livid snakes entwined in their hair; Cerberus stood agape and his triple jaws forgot to bark; the wind subsided, and Ixion’s wheel came to a stop.

	“And now, as he retraced his steps, he had avoided all mischance, and the regained Eurydice was nearing the upper world, following behind—for that condition had Proserpine imposed—when a sudden frenzy seized Orpheus, unwary in his love, a frenzy meet for pardon, did Hell know how to pardon! He halted, and on the very verge of light, unmindful, alas, and vanquished in purpose, on Eurydice, now regained looked back! In that instant all his toil was spilt like water, the ruthless tyrant’s pact was broken, and thrice a peal of thunder was heard amid the

See, again the cruel Fates call me back, and sleep seals my swimming eyes. And now farewell! I am borne away, covered in night’s vast pall, and stretching towards you strengthless hands, regained, alas! no more.’ She spoke, and straightway from his sight, like smoke mingling with thin air, vanished afar and saw him not again, as he vainly clutched at the shadows with so much left unsaid; nor did the ferryman
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c] of Orcus suffer him again to pass the barrier of the marsh. What could he do? Whither turn, twice robbed of his wife? With what tears move Hell? To what deities address his prayers? She indeed, already death-cold, was afloat in the Stygian barque. Of him they tell that for seven whole months day after day beneath a lofty crag beside lonely Strymon’s stream he wept, and in the shelter of cool dales unfolded this his tale, charming tigers and drawing oaks with his song: even as the nightingale, mourning beneath a poplar’s shade, bewails her young ones’ loss, when a heartless ploughman, watching their resting place, has plucked them unfledged from the nest: the mother weeps all night long, as, perched on a branch, she repeats her piteous song and fills all around with plaintive lamentation. No thought of love or wedding song could bend his soul. Alone he roamed the frozen North, along the icy Tanais, and the fields ever wedded to Riphaean snows, mourning his lost Eurydice and Pluto’s cancelled boon; till the Ciconian women, resenting such devotion, in the midst of their sacred rites and their midnight Bacchic orgies, tore the

	Thus Proteus, and at a bound plunged into the deep sea, and where he plunged, whirled the water into foam beneath the eddy. Cyrene stayed, and straightway spoke to the startled youth: “You may dismiss from your mind the care that troubles it. This is the whole cause of the sickness, and hence it is that the Nymphs, with whom she used to tread the dance in the deep groves, have sent this wretched havoc on your bees. You must offer a suppliant’s gifts, sue for peace, and pay homage to the gentle maidens of the woods; for they will grant pardon to prayers, and relax their wrath. But first I will tell you in order the manner of your supplication. Pick out four choice bulls, of surpassing form, that now graze among your herds on the heights of green Lycaeus, and as many heifers of unyoked neck. For these set up four altars by the stately shrines of the goddesses, and drain the sacrificial blood from their throats, but leave the bodies of the steers within the leafy grove. Later, when the ninth
	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c] Dawn displays her rising beams, you must offer to Orpheus funeral dues of Lethe’s poppies, slay a black ewe, and revisit the grove. Then with Eurydice appeased you should honour her with the slaying of a calf.”

	As frontispiece in some first century [c dimgray]de luxe[/c] edition of the [c dimgray]Aeneid[/c] there appeared (just as in Mackail’s) a portrait of Virgil beneath which the editor had composed the following elegant prelude to the epic:
	[m1]\ [/m]

	Ille ego, qui quondam gracili modulatus avena
	carmen, et egressus silvis vicina coegi
	ut quamvis avido parerent arva colono,
	gratum opus agricolis: at nunc horrentia Martis …

	I am he who once tuned my song on a slender reed,
	then, leaving the woodland, compelled the neighbouring
	fields to serve the husbandman, however grasping—
	a work welcome to farmers: but now of Mars’ bristling …
	Misled by the word [c dimgray]ego[/c] (as they were by [c dimgray]Mantua me genuit[/c] in the poet’s epitaph) the ancient commentators jumped to the erroneous conclusion that these verses were composed by the poet himself and then deleted by his editor Varius. They are well worth preserving as editorial ornament, but are not to be attributed to Virgil. That the epic began with the words [c dimgray]Arma virumque[/c] is proved not only by the unanimous witness of the manuscripts but by the explicit references of Propertius (2.34.63), Ovid ([c dimgray]Trist.[/c] 2.533), Persius (1.96), and Martial (8.56.19).

	There was an ancient city, the home of Tyrian settlers, Carthage, over against Italy and the Tiber’s mouths afar, rich in wealth and stern in war’s pursuits. This, ’tis said, Juno loved above all other lands, holding Samos itself less dear.

	hope. Yet in truth she had heard that a race was springing from Trojan blood, to overthrow some day the Tyrian towers; that from it a people, kings of broad realms and proud in war, should come forth for Libya’s downfall: so rolled the wheel of fate. The daughter of Saturn, fearful of this and mindful of the old war which erstwhile she had fought at Troy for her beloved Argos—not yet, too, had the cause of her wrath and her bitter sorrows faded from her mind: deep in her heart remain the judgment of Paris and the outrage to her slighted beauty, her hatred of the race
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] and the honours paid to ravished Ganymede—inflamed hereby yet more, she tossed on the wide main the Trojan remnant, left by the Greeks and pitiless Achilles, and kept them far from Latium; and many a year they wandered, driven by the fates o’er all the seas. So vast was the effort to found the Roman race.

	Hardly out of sight of Sicilian land were they spreading their sails seaward, and merrily ploughing the foaming brine with brazen prow, when Juno, nursing an undying wound deep in her heart, spoke thus to herself: “What! I resign my purpose, baffled, and fail to turn from Italy the Teucrian king! The fates, doubtless, forbid me! Had Pallas power to burn up the Argive fleet and sink the sailors in the deep, because of one single man’s guilt, and the frenzy of Ajax, son of Oileus? Her own hand hurled from the clouds Jove’s swift flame, scattered their ships, and upheaved the sea in tempest; but him, as with pierced breast he breathed forth flame, she caught in a whirlwind and impaled on a spiky crag.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	Thus inwardly brooding with heart inflamed, the goddess came to Aeolia, motherland of storm clouds, tracts teeming with furious blasts. Here in his vast cavern, Aeolus, their king, keeps under his sway and with prison bonds curbs the struggling winds and the roaring gales. They, to the mountain’s mighty moans, chafe blustering around the barriers. In his lofty citadel sits Aeolus, sceptre in hand, taming their passions and soothing their rage; did he not so, they would surely bear off with them in wild flight seas and lands and the vault of heaven, sweeping them through space. But, fearful of this, the father omnipotent hid them in gloomy caverns, and over them piled high mountain masses and gave them a king who, under fixed covenant, should be skilled to tighten and loosen the reins at command. Him Juno now addressed thus in suppliant speech:

	“Aeolus—for to you the father of gods and king of men has given power to calm and uplift the waves with the wind—a people hateful to me sails the Tyrrhene sea, carrying into Italy Ilium’s vanquished gods. Hurl fury into your winds, sink and overwhelm the ships, or drive the men asunder and scatter their bodies on the deep. Twice seven nymphs have I of wondrous beauty, of whom Deiopea, fairest of form, I will link to you in sure wedlock, making her yours for ever, that for such service of yours she may spend all her years with you, and make you father of fair offspring.”

	So he spoke and, turning his spear, smote the hollow mount on its side; when lo! the winds, as if in armed array, rush forth where passage is given, and blow in storm blasts across the world. They swoop down upon the sea, and from its lowest depths upheave it all—East and South winds together, and the Southwester, thick with tempests—and shoreward roll vast billows. Then come the cries of men and creaking of cables. In a moment clouds snatch sky and day from the Trojans’ eyes; black night broods over the deep. From pole to pole it thunders, the skies lighten with frequent flashes, all forebodes the sailors instant death. Straightway Aeneas’ limbs weaken with chilling dread; he groans and, stretching his two upturned hands to heaven, thus cries aloud: “O thrice and four times blest, whose lot it was to meet death before their fathers’ eyes beneath the lofty walls of Troy! O son of Tydeus,
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] bravest of the Danaan race, ah! that I could not fall on the Ilian plains and gasp out this lifeblood at your hand—where, under the spear of Aeacides, fierce Hector lies prostrate, and mighty Sarpedon; where Simois seizes and sweeps beneath his waves so many shields and helms and bodies of the brave!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As he flings forth such words, a gust, shrieking from the North, strikes full on his sail and lifts the waves to heaven. The oars snap, then the prow swings round and gives the broadside to the waves; down in a heap comes a sheer mountain of water. Some of the seamen hang upon the billow’s

Three ships the South Wind catches and hurls on hidden rocks—rocks the Italians call the Altars, rising amidst the waves, a huge ridge topping the sea. Three the East forces from the deep into shallows and sandbanks, a piteous sight, dashes on shoals and girds with a mound of sand. One, which bore the Lycians and loyal Orontes, before the eyes of Aeneas a mighty toppling wave strikes astern. The helmsman is dashed out and hurled head foremost, but the ship is thrice on the same spot whirled round and round by the wave and engulfed in the sea’s devouring eddy. Here and there are seen swimmers in the vast abyss, with weapons of men, planks, and Trojan treasure amid the waves. Now the stout ship of Ilioneus, now of brave Achates, and that wherein Abas sailed and that of aged Aletes, the storm has mastered; with side joints loosened, all let in the hostile flood and gape at every seam.

	Meanwhile Neptune saw the sea in a turmoil of wild uproar, the storm let loose and the still waters seething up from their lowest depths. Greatly troubled was he, and gazing out over the deep he raised a composed countenance above the water’s surface. He sees Aeneas’ fleet scattered over all the sea, the Trojans overwhelmed by the waves and by the falling heavens, nor did Juno’s wiles and wrath escape her brother’s eye. East Wind and West he calls before him, then speaks thus:

	[m1]\ [/m]
	Thus he speaks, and swifter than his word he calms the swollen seas, puts to flight the gathered clouds, and brings back the sun. Cymothoë and Triton with common effort thrust the ships from the sharp rock; the god himself levers them up with his trident, opens the vast quicksands, allays the flood, and on light wheels glides over the topmost waters. And as, when ofttimes in a great nation tumult has risen, the base rabble rage angrily, and now brands and stones fly, madness lending arms; then, if perchance they set eyes on a man honoured for noble character and service, they are silent and stand by with attentive ears; with speech he sways their passion and soothes their breasts: just so, all the roar of ocean sank, soon as the Sire, looking forth upon the waters and driving under a clear sky, guides his steeds and, flying onward, gives reins to his willing car.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The wearied followers of Aeneas strive to run for the nearest shore and turn towards the coast of Libya. There in a deep inlet lies a spot, where an island forms a harbour with the barrier of its sides, on which every wave from the main is broken, then parts into receding ripples. On either side loom heavenward huge cliffs and twin peaks, beneath whose crest far and wide is the stillness of sheltered water; above, too, is a background of shimmering woods with an overhanging grove, black with gloomy shade. Under the brow of the fronting cliff is a cave of hanging rocks; within are fresh waters and seats in the living stone, a haunt of Nymphs. Here no fetters imprison weary ships, no anchor

Here, with seven ships mustered from all his fleet, Aeneas takes shelter; and, disembarking with earnest longing for the land, the Trojans gain the welcome beach and stretch their brine-drenched limbs upon the shore. At once Achates struck a spark from flint, caught the fire in leaves, laid dry fuel about, and waved the flame amid the tinder. Then, wearied with their lot, they take out the corn of Ceres, spoiled by the waves, with the tools of Ceres, and prepare to parch the rescued grain in the fire and crush it under the stone.

	Meanwhile Aeneas climbs a peak and seeks a full view far and wide over the deep, if he may but see aught of storm-tossed Antheus and his Phrygian galleys, or of Capys or the arms of Caïcus on the high stern. There is no ship in sight; he descries three stags straying on the shore; whole herds follow behind these and in long line graze down the valley. Thereon he stopped and seized in his hand his bow and swift arrows, the arms borne by faithful Achates; and first he lays low the leaders themselves, their heads held high with branching antlers, then routs the herd and all the common sort, driving them with his darts amid the leafy woods. Nor does he stay his hand till seven huge forms he stretches victoriously on the ground, equal in number to his ships. Then he seeks the harbour and divides them among all his company. Next he shares the wine, which good Acestes had stowed in jars on the Trinacrian shore, and hero-like had given at parting; and, speaking thus, calms their sorrowing hearts:

Perhaps even this distress it will some day be a joy to recall. Through varied fortunes, through countless hazards, we journey towards Latium, where fate promises a home of peace. There it is granted that Troy’s realm shall rise again; endure, and live for a happier day.”

	Such words he spoke, while sick with deep distress he feigns hope on his face, and deep in his heart stifles his anguish. The others prepare the spoil, the feast that is to be; they flay the hides from the ribs and lay bare the flesh; some cut it into pieces and impale it, still quivering, on spits; others set cauldrons on the shore and feed them with fire. Then with food they revive their strength, and stretched along the grass take their fill of old wine and fat venison. When hunger was banished by the feast and the board was cleared, in long discourse they yearn for their lost comrades, between hope and fear uncertain whether to deem them still alive, or bearing the final doom and hearing no more when called. More than the rest does loyal Aeneas in silence mourn the loss now of valiant Orontes, now of Amycus, the cruel doom of Lycus, brave Gyas, and brave Cloanthus.

	Now all was ended, when from the sky’s summit Jupiter looked forth upon the sail-winged sea and outspread lands, the shores and peoples far and wide, and, looking, paused on heaven’s height and cast his eyes on Libya’s realm.

	gods, and frighten with your bolt, what great crime could my Aeneas—could my Trojans—have wrought against you, to whom, after many disasters borne, the whole world is barred for Italy’s sake? Surely it was your promise that from them some time, as the years rolled on, the Romans were to arise; from them, even from Teucer’s restored line, should come rulers to hold the sea and all lands beneath their sway. What thought, father, has turned you? That promise, indeed, was my comfort for Troy’s fall and sad overthrow, when I weighed fate against the fates opposed. Now, though tried by so many disasters, the same fortune dogs them. What end of their toils, great king, do you grant? Antenor could escape the Achaean host, thread safely the Illyrian gulfs and inmost realms of the Liburnians, and pass the springs of Timavus, whence through nine mouths, with a mountain’s mighty roar, it comes a bursting flood and buries the fields under its sounding sea.
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] Yet here he set Padua’s town, a home for his Teucrians, gave a name to the race, and hung up the arms of Troy; now, settled in tranquil peace, he is at rest. But we, your offspring, to whom you grant the heights of heaven, have lost our ships—O shame unutterable!—and, to appease one angry foe, are betrayed and kept far from Italian shores. And thus is piety honoured? Is this the way you restore us to empire?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Smiling on her with that look wherewith he clears sky and storms, the Father of men and gods gently kissed his daughter’s lips, and then spoke thus: “Spare your fears, Lady of Cythera; your children’s fates abide unmoved. You

This your son—for, since this care gnaws at your heart, I will speak and, further unrolling the scroll of fate, will disclose its secrets—shall wage a great war in Italy, shall crush proud nations, and for his people shall set up laws and city walls, till the third summer has seen him reigning in Latium and three winters have passed in camp since the Rutulians were laid low.
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] But the lad Ascanius, now surnamed Iulus—Ilus he was, while the Ilian state stood firm in sovereignty—shall fulfil in empire thirty great circles of rolling months, shall shift his throne from Lavinium’s seat, and, great in power, shall build the walls of Alba Longa. Here then for thrice a hundred years unbroken shall the kingdom endure under Hector’s race, until Ilia, a royal priestess, shall bear to Mars her twin offspring. Then Romulus, proud in the tawny hide of the she-wolf, his nurse, shall take up the line, and found the walls of Mars and call the people Romans after his own name. For these I set no bounds in space or time; but have given empire without end. Spiteful Juno, who now in her fear troubles sea and earth and sky, shall change to better counsels and with me cherish the Romans, lords of the world, and the nation of the toga. Thus is it decreed. There shall come a day, as the sacred seasons glide past, when the house of Assaracus

	Caesar, who shall extend his empire to the ocean, his glory to the stars, a Julius,
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] name descended from great Iulus! Him, in days to come, shall you, anxious no more, welcome to heaven, laden with Eastern spoils; he, too, shall be invoked in vows. Then wars shall cease and savage ages soften; hoary Faith and Vesta, Quirinus with his brother Remus, shall give laws. The gates of war, grim with iron and close-fitting bars, shall be closed;
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] within, impious Rage, sitting on savage arms, his hands fast bound behind with a hundred brazen knots, shall roar in the ghastliness of blood-stained lips.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So speaking, he sends the son of Maia down from heaven, that the land and towers of new-built Carthage may open to greet the Teucrians, and Dido, ignorant of fate, might not bar them from her lands. Through the wide air he flies on the oarage of wings, and speedily alights on the Libyan coasts. At once he does his bidding, and, God willing it, the Phoenicians lay aside their savage thoughts; above all, the queen receives a gentle mind and gracious purpose towards the Teucrians.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But loyal Aeneas, through the night revolving many a care, so soon as kindly light was given, determines to issue forth and explore the strange country; to learn to what coasts he has come with the wind, who dwells there, man or beast—for all he sees is waste—then bring back the tidings to his friends. The fleet he hides in over-arching groves beneath a hollow rock, closely encircled by trees and quivering shade; then, Achates alone attending, himself strides forth, grasping in hand two shafts, tipped with broad steel. Across his path, in the midst of the forest,

For from her shoulders in huntress fashion she had slung the ready bow and had given her hair to the winds to scatter; her knee bare, and her flowing robes gathered in a knot. Before he speaks, “Ho!” she cries, “tell me, youths, if perchance you have seen a sister of mine here straying, girt with quiver and a dappled lynx’s hide, or pressing with shouts on the track of a foaming boar.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Thus Venus; and thus in answer Venus’ son began: “None of your sisters have I heard or seen—but by what name should I call you, maiden? for your face is not mortal nor has your voice a human ring; O goddess surely! sister of Phoebus, or one of the race of Nymphs? Show grace to us, whoever you may be, and lighten this our burden. Inform us, pray, beneath what sky, on what coasts of the world, we are cast; knowing nothing of countries or peoples we wander driven hither by wind and huge billows. Many a victim shall fall for you at our hand before your altars.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then said Venus: “Nay, I claim not such worship. Tyrian maids are wont to wear the quiver, and bind their ankles high with the purple buskin. It is the Punic realm you see, a Tyrian people, and the city of Agenor; but the bordering country is Libyan, a race unconquerable in war. Dido wields the sceptre—Dido, who, fleeing from her brother, came from the city of Tyre. Long would be the tale of wrong, long its winding course—but the main heads of the story I will trace.

	in gold of the Phoenicians, and fondly loved by unhappy Dido; to him her father had given the maiden, yoking her to him in the first bridal auspices. But the kingdom of Tyre was in the hands of her brother Pygmalion, monstrous in crime beyond all others. Between these two came frenzy. The king, impiously before the altars and blinded by lust for gold, strikes down Sychaeus unawares by stealthy blow, without a thought for his sister’s love; and for long he hid the deed, and by many a pretence cunningly cheated the lovesick bride with empty hope. But in her sleep came the very ghost of her unburied husband; raising his pale face in wondrous wise, he laid bare the cruel altars and his breast pierced with steel, unveiling all the secret horror of the house. Then he bids her take speedy flight and leave her country, and to aid her journey brought to light treasures long hidden underground, a mass of gold and silver known to none. Moved by this, Dido made ready her flight and her company. Then all assemble who felt towards the tyrant relentless hatred or keen fear; ships, which by chance were ready, they seize and load with gold; the wealth of grasping Pygmalion is borne overseas, the leader of the enterprise a woman. They came to the place where today you will see the huge walls and rising citadel of new Carthage, and bought ground—Byrsa they called it therefrom—as much as they could encompass with a bull’s hide,

	“O goddess, should I, tracing back from the first beginning, go on to tell, and you have leisure to hear the story of our woes, sooner would heaven close and evening lay the day to rest. From ancient Troy, if perchance the name of Troy has come to your ears, sailing over distant seas, the storm at its own caprice drove us to the Libyan coast. I am the loyal Aeneas, who carry with me in my fleet my household gods, snatched from the foe; my fame is known to the heavens above. It is Italy I seek, my fathers’ land, and a race sprung from Jupiter most high. With twice ten ships I embarked on the Phrygian sea, following the fates declared, my goddess-mother pointing me the way; scarcely do seven remain, shattered by waves and wind. Myself unknown and destitute, I wander over the Libyan wastes, driven from Europe and from Asia.” His further complaint Venus suffered not, but in the midst of his lament broke in thus:

As they, returning, sport with rustling wings, and in company have circled the sky and uttered their songs, with like joy your ships and the men of your company have reached harbour already or under full sail enter the river’s mouth.

	She spoke, and as she turned away, her roseate neck flashed bright. From her head her ambrosial tresses breathed celestial fragrance; down to her feet fell her raiment, and in her step she was revealed a very goddess. He knew her for his mother, and as she fled pursued her with these words: “Why, cruel like others, do you so often mock your son with vain phantoms? Why am I not allowed to clasp hand in hand and hear and utter words unfeigned?” Thus he reproaches her and bends his steps towards the city. But Venus shrouded them, as they went, with dusky air, and enveloped them, goddess as she was, in a thick mantle of cloud, that none might see or touch them, none delay or seek the cause of their coming. She herself through the sky goes her way to Paphos, and joyfully revisits her abode, where the temple and its hundred altars steam with Sabaean incense and are fragrant with garlands ever fresh.

	Meanwhile they sped on the road where the pathway points. And now they were climbing the hill that looms large over the city and looks down on the confronting towers. Aeneas marvels at the massive buildings, mere huts once; marvels at the gates, the din and paved high-roads. Eagerly the Tyrians press on, some to build walls, to rear the citadel, and roll up stones by hand; some to choose the site for a dwelling and enclose it with a furrow. Here some

Even as bees in early summer, amid flowery fields, ply their task in sunshine, when they lead forth the full-grown young of their race, or pack the fluid honey and strain their cells to bursting with sweet nectar, or receive the burdens of incomers, or in martial array drive from their folds the drones, a lazy herd; all aglow is the work and the fragrant honey is sweet with thyme. “Happy they whose walls already rise!” cries Aeneas, lifting his eyes towards the city roofs. Veiled in a cloud, he enters—wondrous to tell—through their midst, and mingles with the people, seen by none!

	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] for thus was the race to be famous in war and rich in substance through the ages. Here Sidonian Dido was founding to Juno a mighty temple, rich in gifts and the presence of the goddess. Brazen was its threshold uprising on steps; bronze plates were its lintel beams, on doors of bronze creaked the hinges. In this grove first did a strange sight appear to him and allay his fears; here first did Aeneas dare to hope for safety and put surer trust in his shattered fortunes. For while beneath the mighty temple, awaiting the queen, he scans each object, while he marvels at the city’s fortune, the handicraft of the several artists and the work of their toil, he sees in due order

	the battles of Ilium, the warfare now known by fame throughout the world, the sons of Atreus, and Priam, and Achilles, fierce in his wrath against both.
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] He stopped and weeping cried: “Is there any place, Achates, any land on earth not full of our sorrow? See, there is Priam! Here, too, virtue finds its due reward; here, too, are tears for misfortune and human sorrows pierce the heart. Dispel your fears; this fame will bring you some salvation.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So he speaks, and feasts his soul on the unsubstantial portraiture, sighing oft, and his face wet with a flood of tears. For he saw how, as they fought round Pergamus, here the Greeks were in rout, the Trojan youth hard on their heels; there fled the Phrygians, plumed Achilles in his chariot pressing them close. Not far away he discerns with tears the snowy-canvassed tents of Rhesus, which, betrayed in their first sleep, the blood-stained son of Tydeus laid waste with many a death, and turned the fiery steeds away to the camp, before they could taste Trojan fodder or drink of Xanthus. Elsewhere Troilus, his armour flung away in flight—unhappy boy, and ill-matched in conflict with Achilles—is carried along by his horses and, fallen backward, clings to the empty car, still clasping the reins; his neck and hair are dragged over the ground, and the dust is scored by his reversed spear. Meanwhile, to the temple of unfriendly Pallas the Trojan women passed along with streaming tresses, and bore the robe, mourning in suppliant guise and beating breasts with hands: with averted face the goddess kept her eyes fast upon the ground. Thrice had Achilles dragged Hector round the walls of Troy and was selling the lifeless body for gold.

	Then indeed from the bottom of his heart he heaves a deep groan, as the spoils, as the chariot, as the very corpse of his friend met his gaze, and Priam outstretching weaponless hands. Himself, too, in close combat with the Achaean chiefs, he recognized, and the Eastern ranks, and swarthy Memnon’s armour.
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] Penthesilea in fury leads the crescent-shielded ranks of the Amazons and blazes amid her thousands; a golden belt she binds below her naked breast, and, as a warrior queen, dares battle, a maid clashing with men.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	While these wondrous sights are seen by Dardan Aeneas, while in amazement he hangs rapt in one fixed gaze, the queen, Dido, moved towards the temple, of surpassing beauty, with a vast company of youths thronging round her. Even as on Eurotas’ banks or along the heights of Cynthus Diana guides her dancing bands, in whose train a thousand Oreads troop to right and left; she bears a quiver on her shoulder, and as she treads overtops all the goddesses; joys thrill Latona’s silent breast—such was Dido, so moved she joyously through their midst, pressing on the work of her rising kingdom. Then at the door of the goddess, beneath the temple’s central dome, girt with arms and high enthroned, she took her seat. Laws and ordinances she gave to her people; their tasks she adjusted in equal shares or assigned by lot; when suddenly Aeneas sees approaching, in the midst of a great crowd, Antheus and Sergestus and brave Cloanthus with others of the Trojans, whom the black storm had scattered on the sea and driven far away to other coasts. Amazed was he; amazed, too, was

	Achates, thrilled with joy and fear. They burned with eagerness to clasp hands, but the uncertain event confuses their hearts. They keep hidden, and, clothed in the enfolding cloud, look to see what is their comrades’ fortune, on what shore they leave the fleet, and why they come; for from all the ships chosen men advanced, craving grace, and with loud cries made for the temple.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When they had entered, and freedom to speak before the queen was granted, the eldest, Ilioneus, with placid mien thus began: “Queen, to whom Jupiter has granted to found a new city, and to put the curb of justice on haughty tribes, we, unhappy Trojans, tempest-driven over every sea, make our prayer to you: ward off the horror of flames from our ships; spare a pious race, and look more graciously on our fortunes. We have not come to spoil with the sword your Libyan homes or to drive stolen booty to the shore. No such violence is in our hearts, nor have the vanquished such assurance. A place there is, by Greeks named Hesperia, an ancient land, mighty in arms and wealth of soil. There dwelt Oenotrians; now the rumour is that a younger race has called it from their leader’s name, Italy. Hither lay our course . . .
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c] when, rising with sudden swell, stormy Orion bore us on hidden shoals and with fierce blasts scattered us afar amid pathless rocks and waves of overwhelming surge; hither to your shores have we few drifted. What race of men is this? What land is so barbarous as to allow this custom? We are debarred the welcome of the beach; they stir up wars and forbid us to set foot on the border of their land.

	and mortal arms, yet look unto gods who will remember right and wrong. A king we had, Aeneas: none more just or dutiful than he, or more renowned in war and arms. If fate still preserves that hero, if he feeds on the air of heaven and lies not yet in the cruel shades, we have no fear, nor would you regret to have taken the first step in the strife of courtesy. In Sicilian regions, too, there are cities and a supply of arms, and a prince of Trojan blood, famed Acestes. Grant us to beach our storm-battered fleet, to fashion planks in the forests and trim oars, so that, if we are granted to find king and comrades and steer our course to Italy, Italy and Latium we may gladly seek; but if our salvation is cut off, if you, noble father of the Trojan people, are the prey of the Libyan gulf, and a nation’s hope no longer lives in Iulus, that we at least may seek the straits of Sicily, whence we came hither, and the homes there ready, and Acestes for our king.” So spoke Ilioneus, and all the sons of Dardanus loudly shouted assent . . .
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then Dido, lowering her eyes, briefly speaks: “Free your hearts of fear, Teucrians; put away your cares. Stern necessity and the new estate of my kingdom force me to do such hard deeds and protect my frontiers far and wide with guards. Who could be ignorant of the race of Aeneas’ people, who of Troy’s town and her brave deeds and brave men, or of the fires of that great war?

The city I build is yours; draw up your ships; Trojan and Tyrian I shall treat alike. And would that your king were here, driven by the same wind—Aeneas himself! Nay, I will send trusty scouts along the coast and bid them traverse the ends of Libya, if perchance he strays shipwrecked in forest or in town.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Stirred in spirit by these words, brave Achates and father Aeneas had long burned to break through the cloud. First Achates addresses Aeneas: “Goddess-born, what purpose now rises in your heart? You see that all is safe, comrades and fleet restored. One
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] only is wanting, whom our own eyes saw engulfed amid the waves; all else agrees with your mother’s words.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Scarce had he said this, when the encircling cloud suddenly parts and clears into open heaven. Aeneas stood forth, gleaming in the clear light, godlike in face and shoulders; for his mother herself had shed upon her son the beauty of flowing locks, with youth’s ruddy bloom, and on his eyes a joyous lustre; even as the beauty which the hand gives to ivory, or when silver or Parian marble is set in yellow gold. Then thus he addresses the queen, and, unforeseen by all, suddenly speaks: “I, whom you seek, am here before you, Aeneas of Troy, snatched from the Libyan waves. O you who alone have pitied Troy’s unutterable woes, you who grant us—the remnant left by the Greeks, now outworn by every mischance of land and sea, and destitute of all—a share in your city and home, to pay you fitting thanks, Dido, is not in our power, nor in theirs who

May the gods, if any divine powers have regard for the good, if there is any justice anywhere—may the gods and the consciousness of right bring you worthy rewards! What happy ages bore you? What glorious parents gave birth to so noble a child? While rivers run to ocean, while on the mountains shadows move over slopes, while heaven feeds the stars, ever shall your honour, your name, and your praises abide, whatever be the lands that summon me!” So saying, he grasps his dear Ilioneus with the right hand, and with the left Serestus; then others, brave Gyas and brave Cloanthus.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Sidonian Dido was amazed, first at the sight of the hero, then at his strange misfortune, and thus her lips made utterance: “What fate pursues you, goddess-born, amidst such perils? What violence drives you to savage shores? Are you that Aeneas whom gracious Venus bore to Dardanian Anchises by the wave of Phrygian Simois? Indeed, I myself remember well Teucer’s coming to Sidon, when exiled from his native land he sought a new kingdom by aid of Belus; my father Belus was then wasting rich Cyprus, and held it under his victorious sway. From that time on the fall of the Trojan city has been known to me; known, too, your name and the Pelasgian kings. Foe though he was, he often lauded the Teucrians with highest praise and claimed that he was sprung from the Teucrians’ ancient stock. Come therefore, sirs, and pass within our halls. Me, too, has a like fortune driven through many toils, and willed that in this land I should at last find rest. Not ignorant of ill I learn to aid distress.”

Coverlets there are, skilfully embroidered and of royal purple; on the tables is massive silver plate, and in gold are graven the doughty deeds of her sires, a long, long course of exploits traced through many a hero from the early dawn of the race.

	Aeneas—for a father’s love did not suffer his heart to rest—speedily sends Achates forward to the ships to carry this news to Ascanius and lead him to the city; in Ascanius all his fond parental care is centred. Presents, too, snatched from the wreck of Ilium, he bids him bring, a mantle stiff with figures wrought in gold, and a veil fringed with yellow acanthus, once worn by Argive Helen when she sailed for Pergamus and her unlawful marriage—she had brought them from Mycenae, the wondrous gift of her mother Leda—the sceptre too, which Ilione, Priam’s eldest daughter, once had borne, a necklace hung with pearls, and a coronet with double circlet of jewels and gold. Speeding these commands, Achates bent his way towards the ships.

	But the Cytherean revolves in her breast new wiles, new schemes; how Cupid, changed in face and form, may come in the stead of sweet Ascanius, and by his gifts kindle the queen to madness and send the flame into her very marrow. In truth, she fears the uncertain house and

	“Son, my strength, my mighty power—O son, who alone scorn the mighty father’s Typhoean

How your brother Aeneas is tossed on the sea about all coasts by bitter Juno’s hate is known to you, and often have you grieved in our grief. Phoenician Dido now holds him, staying him with soft words, and I dread what may be the outcome of Juno’s hospitality; at such a turning point of fortune she will not be idle. Wherefore I purpose to outwit the queen with guile and encircle her with love’s flame, that so no power may change her, but on my side she may be held fast in strong love for Aeneas. How you can do this take now my thought. The princely boy, my chiefest care, at his dear father’s bidding, makes ready to go to the Sidonian city, bearing gifts that survive the sea and the flames of Troy. Him will I lull to sleep, and on the heights of Cythera or of Idalium will hide in my sacred shrine, so that he may by no means learn my wiles or come between to thwart them. For but a single night, feign by craft his form and, boy that you are, don the boy’s familiar face, so that when, in the fullness of her joy, amid the royal feast and the flowing wine, Dido takes you to her bosom, embraces you and imprints sweet kisses, you may breathe into her a hidden fire and beguile her with your poison.” Love obeys his dear mother’s words, lays by his wings, and walks joyously with

	And now, obedient to her word and rejoicing in Achates as guide, Cupid went forth, carrying the royal gifts for the Tyrians. As he enters, the queen has already, amid royal hangings, laid herself on a golden couch, and taken her place in their midst. Now father Aeneas, now the Trojan youth gather, and the guests recline on coverlets of purple. Servants pour water on their hands, serve bread from baskets, and bring smooth-shorn napkins. There are fifty serving-maids within, whose task it is to arrange the long feast in order and keep the hearth aglow with fire. A hundred more there are, with as many pages of like age, to load the board with viands and set out the cups. The Tyrians, too, are gathered in throngs throughout the festal halls; summoned to recline on the embroidered couches, they marvel at the gifts of Aeneas, marvel at Iulus, at the god’s glowing looks and well-feigned words, at the robe and veil, embroidered with saffron acanthus. Above all, the unhappy Phoenician, doomed to impending ruin, cannot satiate her soul, but takes fire as she gazes, thrilled alike by the boy and by the gifts. He, when he has hung in embrace on Aeneas’ neck and satisfied the deluded father’s deep love, goes to the queen. With her eyes, with all her heart she clings to him and repeatedly fondles him in her lap, knowing not, poor Dido, how great a god settles there to

	When first there came a lull in the feasting, and the boards were cleared, they set down great bowls and crown the wine. A din arises in the palace and voices roll through the spacious halls; lighted lamps hang down from the fretted roof of gold, and flaming torches drive out the night. Then the queen called for a cup, heavy with jewels and gold, and filled it with wine—one that Belus and all of Belus’ line had been wont to use. Then through the hall fell silence: “Jupiter—for they say that you appoint laws for host and guest—grant that this be a day of joy for Tyrians and the voyagers from Troy, and that our children may remember it! May Bacchus, giver of joy, be near, and bounteous Juno; and do you, Tyrians, grace the gathering with friendly spirit!” She spoke, and on the board offered a libation of wine, and, after the libation, was first to touch the goblet with her lips; then with a challenge gave it to Bitias. He briskly drained the foaming cup, and drank deep in the brimming gold; then other lords drank. Long-haired Iopas, once taught by mighty Atlas, makes the hall ring with his golden lyre. He sings of the wandering moon and the sun’s toils; whence sprang man and beast, whence rain and fire; of Arcturus, the rainy Hyades and the twin Bears; why wintry suns make such haste to dip themselves in Ocean, or what delay stays the slowly passing nights. With shout on shout the Tyrians applaud, and the Trojans follow. No less did unhappy Dido prolong the night with varied talk and drank deep draughts of love, asking much of Priam, of Hector much; now of the armour in which

	“Too deep for words, O queen, is the grief you bid me renew, how the Greeks overthrew Troy’s wealth and woeful realm—the sights most piteous that I saw myself and wherein I played no small role. What Myrmidon or Dolopian, or soldier of the stern Ulysses, could refrain from tears in telling such a tale? And now dewy night is speeding from the sky and the setting stars counsel sleep. Yet if such is your desire to learn of our disasters, and in few words to hear of Troy’s last agony, though my mind shudders to remember and has recoiled in pain, I will begin.

	“Broken in war and thwarted by the fates, the Danaan chiefs, now that so many years were gliding by, build by Pallas’ divine art a horse of mountainous bulk, and interweave its ribs with planks of fir. They pretend it is an offering for their safe return; this is the rumour that goes abroad. Here, within its dark sides, they stealthily enclose the choicest of their stalwart men and deep within they fill the huge cavern of the belly with armed soldiery.

	sail and hide themselves on the barren shore. We thought they had gone and before the wind were bound for Mycenae. So all the Teucrian land frees itself from its long sorrow. The gates are opened; it is a joy to go and see the Doric camp, the deserted stations and forsaken shore. Here the Dolopian bands encamped, here cruel Achilles; here lay the fleet; here they used to meet us in battle. Some are amazed at maiden Minerva’s gift of death, and marvel at the massive horse: and first Thymoetes urges that it be drawn within our walls and lodged in the citadel; either it was treachery or the doom of Troy was already tending that way. But Capys, and they whose minds were wiser in counsel, bid us either hurl headlong into the sea this guile of the Greeks, this distrusted gift, or fire it with flames heaped beneath; or else pierce and probe the hollow hiding place of the belly. The wavering crowd is torn into opposing factions.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“Then, foremost of all and with a great throng following, Laocoön in hot haste runs down from the citadel’s height, and cries from afar: ‘My poor countrymen, what monstrous madness is this? Do you believe the foe has sailed away? Do you think that any gifts of the Greeks are free from treachery? Is Ulysses known to be this sort of man? Either enclosed in this frame there lurk Achaeans, or this has been built as an engine of war against our walls, to spy into our homes and come down upon the city from above; or some trickery lurks inside. Men of Troy, trust not the horse. Whatever it be, I fear the Greeks, even when bringing gifts.’ So saying, with mighty force he hurled his great spear at the beast’s side and the arched frame of the belly. The spear stood quivering and with the cavity’s reverberation the vaults rang hollow, sending forth a moan.

	“But meanwhile some Dardan shepherds with loud shouts were haling to the king a youth whose hands were bound behind his back. To compass this very end and open Troy to the Achaeans, deliberately, stranger though he was, he had placed himself in their path, confident in spirit and ready for either event, either to ply his crafty wiles or to meet certain death. From all sides, in eagerness to see, the Trojan youth run streaming in and vie in mocking the captive. Hear now the treachery of the Greeks and from a single crime learn the wickedness of all . . . For as he stood amid the gazing crowd, dismayed, unarmed, and cast his eyes about the Phrygian bands, ‘Alas!’ he cried, ‘what land now, what seas can receive me? Or what fate at the last yet awaits my misery? No place at all have I among the Greeks, and the Trojans themselves, too, wildly clamour for vengeance and my life.’ At that wail our mood was changed and all violence checked. We urge him to say from what blood he is sprung and what tidings he brings. ‘Tell us,’ we cry, ‘on what you rely, now that you are our prisoner.’ [c dimgray]At last he lays aside his fear and speaks these words:[/c]

While he stood secure in princely power and strong in the councils of the kings, we, too, bore some name and renown. But when through the malice of subtle Ulysses—not unknown is the tale—he passed from this world above, I dragged on my ruined life in darkness and grief, wrathful in my heart over the fate of my innocent friend. Nor in my madness was I silent, but, if any chance should offer, if I ever returned in triumph to my native Argos, I vowed myself his avenger and with my words awoke fierce hate. Hence for me the first taint of ill; hence would Ulysses ever terrify me with new charges; hence would he sow dark rumours in the crowd and with guilty fear seek weapons. Nor indeed did he rest until with Calchas as his tool—but why do I vainly unroll this unwelcome tale? Or why delay you?

	all, when this horse was ready, a structure compacted of maple beams, storm clouds thundered throughout the sky. Perplexed, we send Eurypylus to ask the oracle of Phoebus, and he brings back from the shrine these gloomy words: “With blood of a slain virgin you appeased the winds, when first, Greeks, you came to the Ilian coasts; with blood must you win your return and gain favour by an Argive life.” When this utterance came to the ears of the crowd, their hearts were dazed, and a cold shudder ran through their inmost marrow. For whom is fate preparing this doom? Whom does Apollo claim? On this the Ithacan with loud clamour drags the seer Calchas into their midst and demands what this is that the gods will. And now many predicated that I was the target of the schemer’s cruel crime and silently saw what was to come. Twice five days is the seer silent in his tent, refusing to denounce any by his lips or to consign to death. Reluctantly, at last, forced by the Ithacan’s loud cries, even as agreed he breaks into utterance and dooms me to the altar. All approved; and what each feared for himself they bore with patience, when turned to one man’s ruin.

And now no hope have I of seeing my ancient homeland, or my sweet children and the father I long for. Of them perchance they will demand due punishment for my flight, and by their death, unhappy ones, expiate this crime of mine. But I beseech you, by the gods above, by the powers

	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] from the ground with shield and quivering spear. Straightway Calchas prophesies that the seas must be essayed in flight, and that Pergamus cannot be uptorn by Argive weapons, unless they seek new omens at Argos, and escort back the deity, whom they have taken away overseas in their curved ships. And now that before the wind they are bound for their native Mycenae, it is but to get them forces and attendant gods; then, recrossing the sea, they will be here unlooked for. So Calchas interprets the omens. This image, at his warning, they have set up in atonement for the Palladium, for the insult to deity, and to expiate the woeful sacrilege. Yet Calchas bade them raise this mass of interlaced timbers so huge, and to build it up to heaven, so that it might find no entrance at the gates, be drawn within the walls, or guard the people under shelter of their ancient faith. For if hand of yours should wrong Minerva’s offering, then utter destruction—may the gods turn rather on himself that augury!—would fall on Priam’s empire and the Phrygians; but if by your hands it climbed into your city, Asia would even advance in mighty war to the walls of Pelops,

	“Hereupon another portent, more fell and more frightful by far, is thrust upon us, unhappy ones, and confounds our unforeseeing souls. Laocoön, priest of Neptune, as drawn by lot, was slaying a great bull at the wonted altars; and lo! from Tenedos, over the peaceful depths—I shudder as I speak—a pair of serpents with endless coils are breasting the sea and side by side making for the shore. Their bosoms rise amid the surge, and their crests, bloodred, overtop the waves; the rest of them skims the main behind and their huge backs curve in many a fold; we hear the noise as the water foams. And now they were gaining the fields and, with blazing eyes suffused with blood and fire, were licking with quivering tongues their hissing mouths. Pale at the sight, we scatter. They in unswerving course make for Laocoön; and first each serpent enfolds in its embrace the small bodies of his two sons and with its fangs feeds upon the hapless limbs. Then himself too, as he comes to their aid, weapons in hand, they seize and bind in mighty folds; and now, twice encircling his waist, twice winding their scaly backs around his throat, they tower above with head and lofty necks. He the while strains his hands to burst the knots, his fillets steeped in gore and black venom; the while he lifts to heaven hideous cries, like the bellowings of a wounded bull that has fled from the altar and shaken from its neck the ill-aimed axe. But, gliding away, the dragon pair escape to the lofty shrines, and seek fierce Tritonia’s citadel, there to nestle under the goddess’s feet and the circle of her shield. Then indeed a strange

	terror steals through the shuddering hearts of all, and they say that Laocoön has rightly paid the penalty of crime, who with his lance profaned the sacred oak and hurled into its body the accursed spear. ‘Draw the image to her house,’ all cry, ‘and supplicate her godhead.’ . . . We part the walls and lay bare the city’s battlements. All gird themselves for the work; under the feet they place gliding wheels, and about the neck stretch hemp bands. The fateful engine climbs our walls, big with arms. Around it boys and unwedded girls chant holy songs and delight to touch the cable with their hands. Up it moves, and glides threatening into the city’s midst. O my country! O Ilium, home of gods, and you Dardan battlements, famed in war! Four times at the gates’ very threshold it halted, and four times from its belly the armour clashed; yet we press on, heedless and blind with rage, and set the ill-omened monster on our hallowed citadel. Even then Cassandra opened her lips for the coming doom—lips at a god’s command never believed by the Trojans. We, hapless ones, for whom that day was our last, wreathe the shrines of the gods with festal boughs throughout the city.

	“Meanwhile the sky revolves and night rushes from the ocean, wrapping in its mighty shade earth and heaven and the wiles of the Myrmidons. Through the town the Teucrians lay stretched in silence; sleep clasps their weary limbs. And now the Argive host, with marshalled ships, was moving from Tenedos, amid the friendly silence of the mute moon, seeking the well-known shores, when the royal galley had raised the beacon light—and Sinon, shielded by the gods’ malign doom, stealthily sets free

The opened horse restores them to the air, and joyfully from the hollow wood come forth Thessandrus and Sthenelus the captains, and dread Ulysses, sliding down the lowered rope; Acamas and Thoas and Neoptolemus of Peleus’ line, prince Machaon, Menelaus, and Epeus himself, who devised the fraud.

Ah me, what aspect was his! How changed he was from that Hector who returns after donning the spoils of Achilles or hurling on Danaan ships the Phrygian fires—with ragged beard, with hair matted with blood, and bearing those many wounds he received around his native walls. I dreamed I wept myself, hailing him first, and uttering words of grief: ‘O light of the Dardan land, surest hope of the Trojans, what long delay has held you? From what shores, Hector, the long looked for, do you come? Oh, how gladly after the many deaths of your kin, after woes untold of citizens and city, our weary eyes behold you! What shameful cause has marred that unclouded face? Why do I see these wounds?’ He answers not, nor heeds my idle questioning, but drawing heavy sighs from his bosom’s depths, ‘Ah, flee, goddess-born,’ he cries, ‘and

All claims are paid to king and country; if Troy’s towers could be saved by strength of hand, by mine, too, had they been saved. Troy entrusts to you her holy things and household gods; take them to share your fortunes: seek for them the mighty city, which, when you have wandered over the deep, you shall at last establish!’ So he speaks and in his hands brings forth from the inner shrine the fillets, great Vesta, and the undying fire.

	“On every side, meanwhile, the city is in a turmoil of anguish; and more and more, though my father Anchises’ house lay far withdrawn and screened by trees, clearer grow the sounds and war’s dread din sweeps on. I shake myself from sleep and, climbing to the roof’s topmost height, stand with straining ears: even as, when fire falls on a cornfield while south winds are raging, or the rushing torrent from a mountain stream lays low the fields, lays low the glad crops and labours of oxen and drags down forests headlong, spellbound the bewildered shepherd hears the roar from a rock’s lofty peak. Then indeed the truth is clear and the guile of the Danaans grows manifest. Even now the spacious house of Deiphobus has fallen, as the fire god towers above; even now his neighbour Ucalegon blazes; the broad Sigean straits reflect the flames. Then rise the cries of men and the blare of clarions. Frantic I seize arms; yet little purpose is there in arms, but my heart burns to muster a force for battle and hasten with my comrades to the citadel. Frenzy and anger drive my soul headlong and I think how glorious it is to die in arms!

What stronghold are we to seize?’ Scarcely had I said the words, when with a groan he answers thus: ‘It is come—the last day and inevitable hour for Troy. We Trojans are no more, Ilium is no more, nor the great glory of the Teucrians; in wrath Jupiter has taken all away to Argos; our city is aflame, and in it the Greeks are lords. The horse, standing high in the city’s midst, pours forth armed men, and Sinon, victorious, insolently scatters flames! Some are at the wide-open gates, as many thousands as ever came from mighty Mycenae; others with confronting weapons have barred the narrow ways; a standing line of steel, with flashing point unsheathed, is ready for the slaughter. Scarce do the first guards of the gates essay battle, and resist in blind warfare.’ By such words of Othrys’ son and by divine will I am driven amid flames and weapons, where the fell Fury, where the roar and the shouts rising to heaven call. Then, falling in with me in the moonlight, comrades join me, and there gather to our side Rhipeus and Epytus, mighty in arms, Hypanis and Dymas, with young Coroebus, son of Mygdon. In those days, as it chanced, he had come to Troy, fired with mad love for Cassandra, and as a son was bringing aid to Priam and the Phrygians—luckless one, not to have heeded the warning of his inspired bride . . . When I saw them in close ranks and eager for battle, I thereupon begin thus: ‘My men, hearts vainly valiant, if your desire is fixed to follow me in my final venture, you see what is the

Then, like ravening wolves in a black mist, when the belly’s lawless rage has driven them blindly forth, and their whelps at home await them with thirsty jaws, through swords, through foes we pass to certain death, and hold our way to the city’s heart; black night hovers around with sheltering shade. Who could unfold in speech that night’s havoc? Who its carnage? Who could match our toils with tears? The ancient city falls, for many years a queen; in heaps lifeless corpses lie scattered amid the streets, amid the homes and hallowed portals of the gods. Nor do Teucrians alone pay penalty with their lifeblood; at times valour returns to the hearts of the vanquished also and the Danaan victors fall. Everywhere is cruel grief, everywhere panic, and full many a shape of death.

He was dazed, and drawing back checked foot and voice.

	at the sight, was drawing away. We charge and with serried arms stream around them; in their ignorance of the ground and the surprise of their panic we slay them on all sides. Fortune favours our first effort. And here, flushed with success and courage, Coroebus cries: ‘Comrades, where fortune first points out the road to safety and where she shows herself auspicious, let us follow. Let us change the shields and don Danaan emblems; whether this is deceit or valour, who would ask in warfare? Our foes themselves shall give us weapons.’ So saying, he then puts on the plumed helmet of And rogeos, and the shield with its comely device, and fits to his side the Argive sword. So does Rhipeus, so Dymas too, and all the youth in delight; each man arms himself in the new-won spoils. We move on, mingling with the Greeks, under gods not our own, and in the blind night we clash in many a close fight, and many a Greek we send down to Orcus. Some scatter to the ships and make with speed for safe shores; some in base terror again climb the huge horse and hide in the familiar womb.

	“Alas, it is wrong for man to rely on the gods for anything against their will! Lo! Priam’s daughter, the maiden Cassandra, was being dragged with streaming hair from the temple and shrine of Minerva, vainly uplifting to heaven her blazing eyes—her eyes, for bonds confined her tender hands. Maddened in soul, Coroebus brooked not this sight, but flung himself to death into the midst of the band. We all follow and charge with serried arms. Here first from the high temple roof we are overwhelmed with the weapons of our friends, and piteous slaughter arises

	from the appearance of our arms and the confusion of our Greek crests. Then the Danaans, with a shout of rage at the maiden’s rescue, mustering from all sides, fall upon us, Ajax most fiercely, the two sons of Atreus, and the whole Dolopian host: even as at times, when a hurricane bursts forth, diverse winds clash, West and South and East, proud of his orient steeds; the forests groan and Nereus, steeped in foam, storms with his trident, and stirs the seas from their lowest depths. There appear, too, those whom amid the shade of the dim night we had routed by stratagem and driven throughout the town; they first recognize our shields and lying weapons, and mark our speech as differing in tone. Straightway we are outnumbered; and first Coroebus falls at the hand of Peneleus by the altar of the warrior goddess; Rhipeus, too, falls, most just of all the Trojans, most zealous for the right, but Heaven’s will was otherwise; Hypanis and Dymas perish, pierced by friends; nor could all your goodness, Panthus, nor Apollo’s fillet shield you in your fall! O ashes of Ilium! O funeral flames of my kin! I call you to witness that in your doom I shunned no fight or hazard, and had the fates willed my death at the hands of the Greeks, that I had earned that death! We are torn from there, Iphitus and Pelias with me, Iphitus now burdened with years, Pelias slow-footed, too, under a wound from Ulysses. Straightway we are called by the clamour to Priam’s house.

Ladders hug the walls, under the very doorposts men force a way on the rungs; with left hands they hold up protecting shields against the darts, and with right they clutch the battlements. The Trojans in turn tear down the towers and all the rooftop of the palace; with these as missiles—for they see the end near—even at the point of death they prepare to defend themselves; and roll down gilded rafters, the stately splendours of their fathers of old. Others with drawn swords have beset the doors below, and guard them, closely massed. Our spirits are quickened to succour the king’s dwelling, to relieve our men by our aid and bring fresh force to the vanquished.

	“There was an entrance with secret doors, a passage running from hall to hall of Priam’s palace, a postern gate apart, by which, while the kingdom yet stood, Andromache, poor soul, would often unattended pass to her husband’s parents, and lead the little Astyanax to his grandsire. I gain the roof’s topmost height, whence the hapless Teucrians were hurling their useless missiles. A tower stood on the sheer edge, rising skyward from the rooftop, whence all Troy was wont to be seen, and the Danaan ships and the Achaean camp. Assailing this with iron round about, where the topmost stories offered weak joints, we wrenched it from its lofty place and thrust it forth. With sudden fall it trails a thunderous ruin, and over the Danaan ranks crashes far and wide. Yet more come up, nor meanwhile do stones nor any kind of missiles cease . . .

	even as when into the light comes a snake, fed on poisonous herbs, whom cold winter kept swollen underground, now, his slough cast off, fresh and glistening in youth, with uplifted breast he rolls his slippery length, towering towards the sun and darting from his mouth a three-forked tongue. With him huge Periphas and Automedon his armour bearer, driver of Achilles’ horses; with him all the Scyrian youth close on the dwelling and hurl flames on to the roof. Pyrrhus himself among the foremost grasps a battle axe, bursts through the stubborn gateway, and from their hinge tears the brass-bound doors; and now, heaving out a panel, he has breached the solid oak and made a huge wide-mouthed gap. Open to view is the house within, and the long halls are bared; open to view are the inner chambers of Priam and the kings of old, and armed men are seen standing at the very threshold.

	“But within, amid shrieks and woeful uproar, the house is in confusion, and at its heart the vaulted halls ring with women’s wails; the din strikes the golden stars. Then through the vast dwelling trembling matrons roam, clinging fast to the doors and imprinting kisses on them. On presses Pyrrhus with his father’s might; no bars, no warders even, can stay his course. The gate totters under the ram’s many blows and the doors, wrenched from their sockets, fall forward. Force finds a way; the Greeks, pouring in, burst a passage, slaughter the foremost, and fill the wide space with soldiery. Not with such fury, when a foaming river, bursting its barriers, has overflowed and with its torrent overwhelmed the resisting banks, does it rush furiously upon the fields in a mass and over all the plains sweep herds and folds. I myself saw on the threshold Neoptolemus, mad with slaughter, and both the sons of

	“Perhaps, too, you may inquire what was Priam’s fate. When he saw the fall of the captured city, saw the doors of his palace shattered, and the foe in the heart of his home, old as he is, he vainly throws his long-disused armour about his aged trembling shoulders, girds on his useless sword, and rushes to his death among his thronging foes. In the middle of the palace and beneath the open arch of heaven was a huge altar, and hard by an ancient laurel, leaning against the altar and clasping the household gods in its shade. Here, round the shrines, vainly crouched Hecuba and her daughters, huddled together like doves swept before a black storm, and clasping the images of the gods. But when she saw even Priam harnessed in the armour of his youth, ‘My poor husband,’ she cries, ‘what dreadful thought has driven you to don these weapons? Where are you rushing to? The hour calls not for such aid or such defenders, not though my own Hector were here himself! Come hither, pray; this altar will guard us all, or you will die with us!’ Thus she spoke, then drew the aged man to her and placed him on the holy seat.

Hereupon Priam, though now in death’s closest grasp, yet held not back nor spared his voice and wrath: ‘For your crime, for deeds so heinous,’ he cries, ‘if in heaven there is any righteousness to mark such sins, may the gods pay you fitting thanks and render you due rewards, who has made me look on my own son’s murder, and defiled with death a father’s face! Not so did Achilles deal with his foe Priam, that Achilles whose sonship you falsely claim, but he had respect for a suppliant’s rights and trust; he gave back to the tomb Hector’s bloodless corpse and sent me back to my realm.’ So spoke the old man and hurled his weak and harmless spear, which straight recoiled from the clanging brass and hung idly from the top of the shield’s boss. To him Pyrrhus: ‘Then you shall bear this news and go as messenger to my sire, Peleus’ son; be sure to tell him of my sorry deeds and his degenerate Neoptolemus! Now die!’ So saying, to the very altar stones he drew him, trembling and slipping in his son’s streaming blood, and wound his left hand in his hair, while with the right he raised high the flashing sword and buried it to the hilt in his side. Such was the close of Priam’s fortunes; such the doom that by fate befell him—to see Troy in flames and Pergamus laid low, he who was once lord of so many tribes and lands, the monarch of Asia. He lies, a huge trunk upon the shore, a head severed from the neck, a corpse without a name!

She, fearing the Trojans’ anger against her for the overthrow of Pergamum, the vengeance of the Greeks, and the wrath of the husband she abandoned—she, the undoing alike of her motherland and ours—had hidden herself and was crouching, hateful creature, by the altars. Fire blazed up in my heart; there comes an angry desire to avenge my ruined country and exact a penalty for her sin. ‘So is she to look unscathed on Sparta and her native Mycenae, and parade a queen in the triumph she has won? Is she to see husband and home, parents and children, attended by a train of Ilian ladies and Phrygian captives? For this is Priam to have perished by the sword? Troy burnt in flames? The Dardan shore so often soaked in blood? Not so! For though there is no glorious renown in punishing a woman and such victory gains no honour, yet I shall win praise for blotting out villainy and exacting just recompense; and it will be a joy to have filled my soul with the flame of revenge and satisfied the ashes of my people.’ Such words I blurted out and in frenzied mind was rushing on,[/c]

	when my gracious mother, never before so brilliant to behold, came before my eyes, in pure radiance gleaming through the night, manifesting her deity, in beauty and stature such as she is wont to appear to the lords of heaven. She caught me by the hand and stayed me, and spoke these words besides with roseate lips: ‘My son, what resentment thus stirs ungovernable wrath? Why this rage? Whither has your care for me fled? Will you not first see where you have left your father, age-worn Anchises, whether Creüsa your wife and the boy Ascanius still live? All these the Greek lines compass round on every side, and did not my love prevent it, by now the flames would have swept them away and the hostile sword would have drunk their blood. Know that it is not the hated face of the Laconian woman, daughter of Tyndareus, it is not Paris that is to blame; but the gods, the relentless gods, overturn this wealth and make Troy topple from her pinnacle. Behold—for all the cloud, which now, drawn over your sight, dulls your mortal vision and with dank pall enshrouds you, I will tear away; fear no commands of your mother nor refuse to obey her counsels—here, where you see shattered piles and rocks torn from rocks, and smoke eddying up mixed with dust, Neptune shakes the walls and foundations that his mighty trident has upheaved, and uproots all the city from her base. Here Juno, fiercest of all, is foremost to hold the Scaean gates and, girt with steel, furiously calls from the ships her allied band . . . Now on the highest towers—turn and see —Tritonian Pallas is planted, gleaming with storm cloud and grim Gorgon. My father himself gives the Greeks courage and auspicious strength; he himself stirs up the gods against the Dardan arms. Hasten your flight, my son, and

	“Then, indeed, it seemed to me that all Ilium was sinking into the flames and that Neptune’s Troy was being overturned from her base—even as when on mountain-tops woodmen emulously strain to overturn an ancient ash tree, which has been hacked with many a blow of axe and iron; it ever threatens to fall, and nods with trembling leafage and rocking crest, till, little by little, overcome with wounds, it gives one loud last groan and, uptorn from the ridges, comes crashing down. I descend and, guided by a god, make my way amid fire and foes. Weapons give me passage and the flames retire.

	“And now, when I had reached the door of my father’s house, my ancient home, my sire, whom it was my first longing to bear high into the hills, and whom first I sought, refused, since Troy was laid low, to prolong his days or suffer exile. ‘You,’ he cried, ‘whose blood has the freshness of youth and whose strength stands sound in native vigour, you must turn to flight . . .

	“So he persisted in his speech and remained unshaken. But we were dissolved in tears—my wife Creüsa, Ascanius, and all our household—pleading that our father not bring all to ruin along with him, nor add weight to our crushing doom. He refuses, and abides in his purpose and his place. Again I rush to arms, and in utter misery long for death, for what device or what chance was offered now? ‘Did you think, my father, that I could go forth leaving you? Did such a monstrous word fall from a father’s lips? If the gods will that naught remain of our great city, if this purpose is firmly set in your mind and it is your pleasure to cast yourself and your kin into the wreck of Troy, for this death the gate is open wide, and soon will come Pyrrhus, steeped in the blood of Priam—Pyrrhus who butchers the son before the father’s eyes, the father at the altars. Was it for this, gracious mother, that you saved me amid fire and sword, to see the foe in the heart of my home, and Ascanius, and my father, and Creüsa at their side, slaughtered in each other’s blood? Arms, men, bring arms; the last light of life calls the vanquished. Give me back to the Greeks; let me seek again and renew the fight. Never this day shall we all die unavenged!’

	[m1]\ [/m]
	“So crying, she filled all the house with moaning; when a sudden portent appears, wondrous to tell. For between the hands and faces of his sad parents, from above the head of Iulus a light tongue of flame was seen to shed a gleam and, harmless in its touch, lick his soft locks and pasture round his temples. Trembling with alarm, we quickly shake out the blazing hair and quench with water the holy fires. But my father Anchises joyously raises his eyes to the skies and uplifts to heaven hands and voice: ‘Almighty Jupiter, if you are moved by any prayers, look upon us—this only do I ask—and if our goodness earn it, give us your aid, Father, and ratify this omen!’

	“Scarcely had the aged man thus spoken, when with sudden crash there was thunder on the left and a star shot from heaven, gliding through the darkness, and drawing a fiery trail amid a flood of light. We watch it glide over the palace roof and bury in Ida’s forest the splendour that marked its path; then the long-drawn furrow shines, and far and wide all about reeks with sulphur. At this, indeed, my father was overcome and, rising to his feet, salutes the gods, and worships the holy star. ‘Now, now there is no delay; I follow, and where you lead, there am I. Gods of my fathers! save my house, save my grandson. Yours is this omen, and under your protection stands Troy. Yes, I yield, and refuse not, my son, to go in your company.’ He ceased,

	and now through the city more loudly is heard the blaze, and nearer the flames roll their fiery flood. ‘Come then, dear father, mount upon my neck; on my own shoulders I will support you, and this task will not weigh me down. However things may fall, we two will have one common peril, one salvation. Let little Iulus come with me, and let my wife follow our steps at a distance. You servants, heed what I say. As one leaves the city, there is a mound and ancient temple of forlorn Ceres, with an old cypress hard by, saved for many years by the reverence of our fathers. To this one spot we will come from different directions. Father, take in your arms the sacred emblems of our country’s household gods; for me, fresh from fierce battle and recent slaughter, it would be sinful to handle them until I have washed myself clean in running water . . .’ So I spoke, and over my broad shoulders and bowed neck I spread the cover of a tawny lion’s pelt and stoop to the burden. Little Iulus clasps his hand in mine, and follows his father with steps that match not his. Behind comes my wife. We pass on amid the shadows; and I, whom of late no shower of missiles could move nor any Greeks thronging in opposing mass, now am affrighted by every breeze and startled by every sound, tremulous as I am and fearing alike for my companion and my burden.

	the course of the streets I know, alas! my wife Creüsa was snatched from me by an unhappy fate. Did she halt? Did she stray from the path or sit down in exhaustion? I do not know. Never again was she restored to my eyes, nor did I look back for my lost one, or cast a thought behind, until we came to the mound and ancient Ceres’ hallowed home. Here at last, when all were gathered, she alone was missing and had vanished from the company, her child, and her husband. What man or god did I not reproach in my frenzy? What crueller sight did I see in the overthrown city? Ascanius, my father Anchises, and the household gods of Troy I put in charge of my fellows and hid them in a winding vale. I myself seek again the city, and gird on my glittering arms. I am resolved to renew every risk, to retrace my way through all Troy and once more expose my life to every peril.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“First I seek again the walls and dark gateway by which I had left the city; I mark and follow back my steps in the night, scanning them with close eye. Everywhere dread fills my heart; the very silence, too, dismays. Then I turn homeward in case—in case she had made her way there! The Danai had rushed in and filled all the house. Forthwith the devouring fire rolls before the wind to the very roof; the flames tower above, the hot blast roars skyward. I pass on and see once more the citadel and Priam’s home. And now in the empty courts of Juno’s sanctuary Phoenix and dread Ulysses, chosen guards, watched the spoil. Here the treasures from all parts of Troy, torn from blazing shrines, tables of the gods, bowls of solid gold, and plundered

Nay, I dared even to cast my cries upon the night; I filled the streets with shouts and in my misery, with vain iteration, called Creüsa again and again. As I rushed in my quest madly and endlessly among the buildings of the city, there rose before my eyes the sad phantom and ghost of Creüsa herself, a form larger than her wont. I was appalled, my hair stood up, and the voice choked in my throat. Then thus she spoke to me and with these words dispelled my cares: ‘Of what avail is it to yield thus to frantic grief, my sweet husband? Not without the will of heaven does this befall; that you should take Creüsa from here in your company cannot be, nor does the mighty lord of high Olympus allow it. Long exile is your lot, a vast stretch of sea you must plough; and you will come to the land Hesperia, where amid the rich fields of husbandmen the Lydian Tiber flows with gentle sweep. There in store for you are happy days, kingship, and a royal wife. Banish tears for your beloved Creüsa. I shall never look upon the proud homes of the Myrmidons or Dolopians, or go to be the slave of Greek matrons, I a Dardan woman and wife of the son of divine Venus; . . . but the mighty mother of the gods
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] keeps me on these shores. And now farewell, and guard your love for our common child.’ When thus she had spoken, she left me weeping and eager to tell her much, and drew back into thin air. Thrice there I strove to throw my arms about her neck; thrice the form, vainly clasped, fled from my hands, even as light winds, and most like a

	“After it pleased the gods above to overthrow the power of Asia and Priam’s guiltless race, after proud Ilium fell, and all Neptune’s Troy smokes from the ground, we are driven by heaven’s auguries to seek distant scenes of exile in waste lands. Close to Antandros and the mountains of Phrygian Ida we build a fleet, uncertain whither the Fates lead or where it is granted us to settle; and there we muster our men. Scarcely had the beginning of summer come when my father Anchises bade us spread sails to Fate, and then with tears I quit my native shores and harbours, and the plains, where once was Troy. An exile, I fare forth upon the deep, with my comrades and son, my household gods and the great deities.

	“At a distance lies the war god’s land, of widespread plains, tilled by Thracians, and once ruled by fierce Lycurgus; friendly of old to Troy, with allied gods, in happier times. To it I sail and on the winding shore found my first city, entering on the task with untoward fates, and from my own name fashion the name Aeneadae.

I drew near, and essaying to tear up the green growth from the soil, that I might deck the altar with leafy boughs, I see an awful portent, wondrous to tell. For from the first tree which is torn from the ground with broken roots trickle drops of black blood and stain the earth with gore. A cold shudder shakes my limbs, and my chilled blood freezes with terror. Once more, from a second also I go on to pluck a tough shoot and probe deep the hidden cause; from the bark of the second also follows black blood. Pondering much in heart, I prayed the woodland Nymphs, and father Gradivus, who rules over the Getic fields, duly to bless the vision and lighten the omen. But when with greater effort I assail the third shafts, and with my knees wrestle against the resisting sands—should I speak or be silent?—a piteous groan is heard from the depth of the mound, and an answering voice comes to my ears. ‘Woe is me! why, Aeneas, do you tear me? Spare me in the tomb at last; spare the pollution of your pure hands! I, born of Troy, am no stranger to you; not from a lifeless stock oozes this blood. Ah! flee the cruel land, flee the greedy shore! For I am Polydorus. Here an iron harvest of spears covered my pierced body, and grew up into sharp javelins.’ Then, indeed, with mind borne down with perplexing dread, I was appalled, my hair stood up, and the voice choked in my throat.

When fear had fled my soul, I lay the divine portents before the chosen chiefs of the people, my father first, and ask what is their judgement. All are of one mind, to quit the guilty land, to leave a place where hospitality is profaned, and to give our fleet the winds. So for Polydorus we solemnize fresh funeral rites, and earth is heaped high upon the mound; altars are set up to the dead, made mournful with sombre ribbons and black cypress; and about them stand Ilian women, with hair streaming as custom ordains. We offer foaming bowls of warm milk and cups of victims’ blood, lay the spirit at rest in the tomb, and with loud voice give the last call.

King Anius—at once king of the people and priest of Phoebus—his brows bound with fillets and hallowed laurel, meets us, and in Anchises finds an old friend.

There men dwell in a hundred great cities, a realm most fertile, whence our earliest ancestor Teucer, if I recall the tale aright, first sailed to the Rhoetean shores, and chose a site for his kingdom.

Nor is it a long run thither: if only Jupiter be gracious, the third dawn shall anchor our fleet on the Cretan coast.’ So he spoke, and on the altars slew the sacrifices due, a bull to Neptune, a bull to you, fair Apollo, a black sheep to the storm god, a white to the favouring Zephyrs.

	“A rumour flies that Idomeneus, the chieftain, has left his father’s realm for exile, that the shores of Crete are abandoned, her homes are void of foes, and the deserted abodes stand ready for our coming. We leave the harbour of Ortygia and fly over the sea, past Naxos with its Bacchic revels on the heights, and green Donysa, Olearos, snow-white Paros, and the sea-strewn Cyclades, and thread the straits sown thick with islands. The sailors’ shouts rise in varied rivalry; the crews raise the cheer: ‘On to Crete and our forefathers!’ A wind rising astern attends us as we sail, and at last we glide up to the ancient shores of the Curetes. Eagerly, therefore, I work on the walls of my chosen city, call it Pergamum, and urge my people, who rejoice at the old name, to love their hearths and build a citadel with lofty roof. And now the ships were just drawn up on the dry beach; our youth were busy with marriages and new tillage, and I was giving laws and homes, when on a sudden, from a tainted quarter of the sky, came a pestilence and season of death, to the wasting of our bodies and the piteous ruin of trees and crops. Men gave up their sweet lives, or dragged enfeebled frames; Sirius, too, scorched the fields with drought; the grass withered, and the sickly crop denied sustenance. My father urges us to recross the sea and go again to Phoebus and Ortygia’s oracle, to pray for

	“It was night and on earth sleep held the living world. The sacred images of the gods, the Phrygian Penates, whom I had borne with me from Troy out of the midst of the burning city, seemed as I lay in slumber to stand before my eyes, clear in the flood of light, where the full moon streamed through the inset windows. Then thus they spoke to me and with these words dispelled my cares. ‘What Apollo is going to tell you when you reach Ortygia, he here utters, and he sends us unbidden to your threshold. We followed you and your arms when Dardania was burned; under you we traversed on ships the swelling sea; we, too, shall exalt to heaven your sons that are to be, and give empire to their city. Prepare mighty walls for the mighty, and do not shrink from the long toil of flight. You must change your home. Not these the shores the Delian Apollo counselled, not in Crete did he bid you settle. A place
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] there is, by Greeks named Hesperia, an ancient land, mighty in arms and in richness of the soil. There dwelt Oenotrians; now the rumour is that a younger race has called it from their leader’s name Italy. This is our abiding home; hence are Dardanus sprung and father Iasius, from whom first came our race. Come, arise, and with good cheer bear to your aged parent these certain tidings, to seek Corythus and the lands of Ausonia. Jupiter denies you the Dictaean fields.’

This rite fulfilled, I gladly tell Anchises the tale and reveal all in order. He recognized the twofold stock and double parentage, and his own confusion through a new error touching ancient lands. Then he speaks: ‘Son, tested by Ilium’s fate, Cassandra alone declared to me this fortune. Now I recall her foretelling this as due to our race, often naming Hesperia, often the Italian realm. But who was to believe that Teucrians should come to Hesperia’s shores? And whom would Cassandra’s prophecies then sway? Let us yield to Phoebus and at his warning pursue the better course.’ So he says and we all obey his speech with joyfulness. This home, too, we quit and, leaving some behind, spread our sails and speed in hollow keels over the waste sea.

Storm clouds enwrapped the day, and a night of rain blotted out the sky: oft from the rent clouds dark lightning fires. We are hurled from our course and wander on the blind waves. Even Palinurus avows that he knows not day from night in the sky nor remembers the way amid the waters. For full three days, shrouded in misty gloom, we wander on the deep, for

No monster more baneful than these, no fiercer plague or wrath of the gods ever rose from the Stygian waves.

We rush upon them with the sword, calling the gods and Jove himself to share our spoil; then on the winding shore we build couches and banquet on the rich dainties. But suddenly, with fearful swoop from the mountains the Harpies are upon us, and with loud clanging shake their wings, plunder the feast; and with unclean touch mire every dish; then amid the foul stench comes a hideous scream.

So when, swooping down, the birds screamed along the winding shore, Misenus on his hollow brass gave the signal from his watch aloft. My comrades charge, and essay a strange combat, to despoil with the sword those filthy birds of ocean. Yet they feel no blows on their feathers, nor wounds on their backs, but, soaring skyward with rapid flight, leave the half-eaten prey and their foul traces. One only, Celaeno, ill-boding seer, alights on a lofty rock, and breaks forth with this cry: ‘Is it even war, in return for slaughtered cattle and slain bullocks, is it war you are ready to bring upon us, sons of Laomedon, and would you drive the guiltless Harpies from their father’s realm? Take then to heart and fix there these words of mine. What the Father omnipotent foretold to Phoebus and Phoebus Apollo to me, I, eldest of the Furies, reveal to you. That you may reach Italy you sail the seas and invoke the winds: to Italy you shall go and freely enter her harbours; but you shall not gird with walls your promised city until dread hunger and the wrong of violence towards us force you to gnaw with your teeth and devour your very tables!’

South winds stretch the sails; we flee over foaming waves, where breeze and pilot called our course. Now amid the waves appear wooded Zacynthus, Dulichium, and Same, and Neritus with its steepy crags. We flee past the rocks of Ithaca, Laertes’ realm, and curse the land that nursed cruel Ulysses. Soon, too, Mount Leucata’s storm-capped peaks come in view, and Apollo’s shrine, dreaded by sailors.

	that Priam’s son, Helenus, is reigning over Greek cities, having won the wife and kingdom of Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, and that Andromache has again passed to a husband of her own race. I was amazed, and my heart burned with a wondrous desire to address him and learn of this strange fortune. I advance from the harbour, leaving shore and fleet, just when, as it happened, Andromache, in a grove outside the city, by the waters of a mimic Simois, was offering her yearly feast and gifts of mourning to the dust, and calling the ghost to Hector’s tomb—the empty mound of green turf that she had hallowed with twin altars, there to shed her tears. When she caught sight of me coming, and saw to her amazement the arms of Troy around, awed by these great marvels she stiffened even as she gazed, and the warmth forsook her limbs. She swoons, and at last after a long time speaks: ‘Are you a real form, a real messenger, coming to me, goddess-born? Are you alive? Or if the light of life has left you, where is Hector?’ She spoke, and shedding a flood of tears filled all the place with her cries.

But him Orestes, fired with strong desire for his stolen bride, and goaded by the Furies of his crimes, catches unawares and slays at his father’s altar. By the death of Neoptolemus a portion of the realm passed as his due to Helenus, who called the plains Chaonian and the whole land Chaonia from Chaon of Troy, and placed on the heights a Pergamus, this Ilian citadel.

And by what course may I surmount such suffering?’ Then Helenus, first sacrificing steers in due form, craves the grace of heaven and unbinds the fillets of his hallowed brow; with his own hand he leads me to your gates, Phoebus, thrilled with your full presence, and then with a priest’s inspired lips thus prophesies:

	close by, a distant path which is no path sunders widely. First in the Trinacrian wave you must strain the oar, and traverse with your ships the salt Ausonian main, past the nether lakes and Aeaean Circe’s isle, before you can build your city in a land of safety. I will declare tokens to you; keep them stored in your mind. When, in your distress, by the waters of a secluded stream, you find a sow lying under the oaks on the shore, just delivered of a litter of thirty young, a white mother reclining on the ground, and white the young at her teats—there shall be the city’s site, there a sure rest from your toils. And fear not the gnawing of tables that awaits you; the Fates will find a way, and Apollo be present at your call. But these lands, and this nearest border of the Italian shore, that is washed by the tide of our own sea, avoid; in all the towns dwell evil Greeks! Here the Narycian Locri have built a city, and Lyctian Idomeneus has beset with soldiery the Sallentine plains; here is the famous town of Philoctetes, the Meliboean captain—tiny Petelia, strong within her wall. Moreover, when your ships have crossed the seas and anchored, and when you then raise altars and pay vows on the shore, veil your hair with the covering of a purple robe, that in the worship of the gods no hostile face may intrude amid the holy fires and mar the omens. Hold to this mode of sacrifice, you and your company; let your children’s children in purity stand fast.

	on the right. These lands, they say, of old broke asunder, torn by force of mighty upheaval—such vast change can length of time effect—when the two countries were one unbroken whole. The sea came in force between, cut off with its waters the Hesperian from the Sicilian coast, and with narrow tideway washes fields and cities on severed shores. Scylla guards the right side; insatiate Charybdis the left; and at the bottom of her seething chasm thrice she sucks the vast waves into the abyss, and again in turn throws them upwards, lashing the stars with spray. But Scylla a cavern confines in dark recesses, from which she thrusts forth her mouths and draws ships on to her rocks. Above she is of human form, down to the waist a fair-bosomed maiden; below, she is a sea dragon of monstrous frame, with dolphins’ tails joined to a belly of wolves. Better is it slowly to round the promontory of Trinacrian Pachynus and double back on a long course than once get sight of misshapen Scylla in her vast cavern, and of the rocks that echo with her sea-green hounds. Moreover, if Helenus has any foresight, if the seer may claim any faith, if Apollo fills his soul with truths, this one thing, Goddess-born, this one in lieu of all I will foretell, and again and again repeat the warning: mighty Juno’s power honour first with prayer; to Juno joyfully chant vows, and win over the mighty mistress with suppliant gifts. So at last you will leave Trinacria behind and be sped triumphantly to the bounds of Italy. And when, thither borne, you draw near to the town of Cumae, the haunted lakes, and Avernus with its rustling woods, you will see an inspired prophetess, who deep in a rocky cave sings the Fates and entrusts to leaves

These remain unmoved in their places and do not quit their rank; but when at the turn of a hinge a light breeze has stirred them, and the open door has scattered the tender foliage, never thereafter does she care to catch them, as they flutter in the rocky cave, nor to recover their places and unite the verses; inquirers depart no wiser than they came, and loathe the Sibyl’s seat. Here let no loss of time by delay be of such importance in your eyes—though comrades chide, though the voyage urgently calls your sails to the deep and you have the chance to swell their folds with favouring gales—that you do not visit the prophetess and with prayers plead that she herself chant the oracles, and graciously open her lips in speech. The nations of Italy, the wars to come, how you are to flee or face each toil, she will unfold to you; and, reverently besought, she will grant you a prosperous voyage. These are the warnings that you are permitted to hear from my voice. Go, then, and by your deeds exalt Troy in greatness unto heaven!’

And yet past this shore you must drift upon the sea; far away is that part of Ausonia which Apollo reveals. Go forth,’ he cries, ‘blest in your son’s love. Why do I continue further, and with speech delay the rising winds?’ Andromache, too, sad at the last parting, brings robes figured with inwoven gold, and for Ascanius a Phrygian scarf, nor does she fail in courtesy, but loads him with gifts from the loom, and thus speaks: ‘Take these last gifts of your kin, you sole surviving image of my Astyanax! Such was he in eyes, in hands and face; even now would his youth be ripening in equal years with yours!’ My tears welled up as I spoke to them my parting words: ‘Live and be happy, as should those whose destiny is now achieved; we are still summoned from fate to fate. Your rest is won. No seas have you to plough, nor have you to seek Ausonian fields that move for ever backward. You see a copy of Xanthus and a Troy, which your own hands have built, under happier omens, I pray, and better shielded from Greeks. If ever I enter the Tiber and Tiber’s neighbouring fields and look on the city walls granted to my race, hereafter of our sister cities and allied peoples, Hesperia allied to Epirus—who have the same Dardanus for ancestor and the same disastrous story—of these two we shall make one Troy in spirit.

	“Along the sea we speed, by the near Ceraunian cliffs, whence is the way to Italy and the shortest voyage over the waves. Meanwhile the sun sets and the hills lie dark in shade. Having allotted the oars, we fling ourselves down near the water on the bosom of the welcome land and refresh ourselves on the dry beach; sleep bedews our weary limbs. Not yet was Night, driven by the Hours, entering her mid course, when Palinurus springs, alert, from his couch, tries all the winds, and with eager ear catches the breeze; he marks all the stars gliding in the silent sky, Arcturus, the rainy Hyades, and the twin Bears, and he scans Orion, girt with golden armour. When he sees that all is calm in a cloudless sky, he gives a loud signal from the stern; we break up camp, venture on our way, and spread the wings of our sails. And now the stars were put to rout and Dawn was blushing, when far off we see dim hills and low-lying Italy. ‘Italy!’ cries Achates the foremost; Italy my comrades hail with joyful cry. Then father Anchises wreathed a great bowl, filled it with wine, and standing on the lofty stern called on the gods . . . ‘O gods, lords of the sea and earth and storms, carry us onward with easy wind, and blow with favouring breath!’ The longed-for breezes freshen, a haven opens as we now draw near, and a temple is seen on Minerva’s Height.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] My comrades furl the sails and shoreward turn the prows. There a harbour is bent bow-like by the eastern surge; its jutting reefs foam with the salt spray, itself lying hid; towering crags let down arms of twin walls, and the temple lies away from the shore. Here, as a first omen, four steeds I saw on the turf, grazing

But yet,’ he cries, ‘those same steeds at times are wont to come under the chariot and beneath the yoke to bear the bit in concord; there is hope also of peace!’ Then we pray to the holy power of Pallas, queen of clashing arms, who first welcomed our cheers, before the altar veil our heads in Phrygian robe, and, following the urgent charge which Helenus had given, duly offer to Argive Juno the prescribed sacrifice.

Then in the distance out of the waves appears Trinacrian Aetna, and from afar we hear the loud moaning of the main, the beating of the rocks, and recurrent crash of waves upon the shore; the shoals dash up and the sands mingle with the surge. Then father Anchises: ‘Surely here is that Charybdis; these are the crags, these the dread rocks Helenus foretold. To the rescue, comrades, and rise together over the oars!’ Even as bidden they do, and first Palinurus swung the groaning prow to the waves leftward; leftward all our force plied with oars and wind.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	“There lies a harbour, safe from the winds’ approach and spacious in itself, but near at hand Aetna thunders with terrifying crashes, and now hurls forth to the sky a black cloud, smoking with pitch-black eddy and glowing ashes, and uplifts balls of flame and licks the stars—now violently vomits forth rocks, the mountain’s uptorn entrails, and whirls molten stone skyward with a roar, and boils up from its lowest depths. The story runs that Enceladus’ form, scathed by the thunderbolt, is weighed down by that mass, and mighty Aetna, piled above, from its burst furnaces breathes forth flame; and ever as he turns his weary side all Trinacria moans and trembles, veiling the sky in smoke. All that night we hide in the woods, enduring monstrous horrors, and see not from what cause comes the sound. For neither did the stars show their fires, nor was heaven bright with starlight, but mists darkened the sky and the dead of night held fast the moon in cloud.

	“And now the next day was rising with the earliest morning star, and Dawn had scattered from the sky the dewy shades, when on a sudden out of the woods comes forth the strange shape of an unknown man, outworn with uttermost hunger, and of piteous guise, and towards the beach stretches suppliant hands. We gaze at him. Ghastly in his squalor, with unshorn beard, and garb fastened with thorns, he was yet in all else a Greek, and had once been sent to Troy in his country’s arms. When far off he saw the

I know that I am one from the Danaan ships, and own that I warred against the gods of Ilium. For that, if my guilt hath done so much wrong, strew me piecemeal over the waves or plunge me in the vast sea. If I die, it will be a boon to have died at the hands of men!’ He ceased, and clung to our knees, clasping them and grovelling there. We urge him to tell who he is, of what blood born, and then what fortune pursues him. My father Anchises himself, with little delay, gives the youth his hand and comforts his heart with the present pledge. At last he lays aside his fear and speaks thus:

Here my comrades, when running away from the grim gateway, thoughtlessly left me in the Cyclops’ vast cave. It is a house of gore and bloodstained feasts, dark and huge within. The master, gigantic, strikes the stars on high—O gods, take such a pest away from earth!—in aspect forbidding, in speech to be accosted by none. He feeds on the flesh of wretched men and their dark blood. I myself saw when he seized in his huge hand two of our company and, as he lounged in the midst of the cave, smashed them on the rock, and the spattered courts swam with gore; I watched while he devoured

Ulysses did not stand for this, nor did the man of Ithaca forget who he was at this dreadful time. For when, gorged with the feast and drowned in wine, the monster rested his drooping neck, and lay in endless length throughout the cave, in his sleep vomiting gore and morsels mixed with blood and wine, we prayed to the great gods, then, with our parts allotted, pour round him on every side, and with pointed weapon pierce the one huge eye that lay deep-set beneath his savage brow, like an Argive shield or the lamp of Phoebus. And so at last we gladly avenged our dead comrades. But flee, hapless ones, flee and cut your cables from the shore! . . . For in shape and size like Polyphemus, as he pens his fleecy flocks in the rocky cave and drains their udders, a hundred other monstrous Cyclopes dwell all along these curved shores and roam the high mountains. For the third time now the moon’s horns are filling with light since I began to drag out my life in the woods among the lonely lairs and haunts of wild beasts, viewing from a rock the huge Cyclopes and trembling at their cries and tramping feet. A sorry living, berries and stony cornels, the boughs supply; and plants feed me with their uptorn roots. Scanning all the view, I saw this fleet drawing to the shore. To it, prove what it might, I surrendered myself. It is enough to have escaped that accursed brood! Take away this life of mine—it is better so—by any death whatever!’

His fleecy sheep attend him—his sole joy they, sole solace of his woe! . . . As soon as he touched the deep waves and reached the sea, he washed therein the oozing blood from his eye’s socket, gnashing his teeth and groaning, then strides through the open sea; nor has the wave yet wetted his towering sides. Desperately we speed our flight far from there, taking on board a suppliant so deserving, and silently cut the cable; then, bending forward, sweep the seas with eager oars. He heard, and turned his steps towards the sound of the splash. But when no power is given him to lay hands on us, and he cannot in his pursuit keep up with the Ionian rollers, he raises a mighty roar, at which the sea and all its waves shuddered and the land of Italy was terrified far within, and Aetna bellowed in its winding caverns. But the race of the Cyclopes, roused from the woods and high mountains, rush to the harbour and throng the shores. We see them, standing impotent with glaring eye, the Aetnean brotherhood, their heads towering to the sky, a grim conclave: even as when on a mountaintop lofty oaks or cone-clad cypresses stand in mass, a high forest of Jove or grove of Diana. In headlong speed, sharp fear drives us to fling out our sheets for any course and spread our sails to any favouring breeze.

Past Pantagia’s mouth with its living rock I voyage—past the Megarian bay and low-lying Thapsus.

	“Stretched in front of a Sicanian bay lies an island, over against wave-beaten Plemyrium; men of old called it Ortygia. Hither, so runs the tale, Alpheus, river of Elis, forced a secret course beneath the sea, and now at your fountain, Arethusa, mingles with the Sicilian waves. As bidden, we worship the great gods of the land, and thence I passed the wondrous rich soil of marshy Helorus. Next we skirt the high reefs and jutting rocks of Pachynus; and far off Camerina—Fate forbade that she ever be disturbed—is seen with the Geloan plains, and Gela, named after its impetuous river. Then steep Acragas, once the breeder of noble steeds, shows in the distance her mighty walls; and, with favourable winds granted by the gods, I leave you behind, palm-girt Selinus, and skirt the shoals of Lilybaeum, perilous with blind rocks. Next the harbour of Drepanum and its joyless shore receive me. Here I, who have been driven by so many ocean-storms, lose, alas! my father Anchises, solace of every care and chance; here, best of fathers, you leave me in my weariness, snatched, alas! from such mighty perils all for naught. Nor did the seer Helenus, though he warned me of many horrors, nor grim Celaeno foretell me this grief. This was my last trial, this the goal of my long voyaging; departing thence, the

	The morrow’s dawn was lighting the earth with the lamp of Phoebus, and had scattered from the sky the dewy shades, when, much distraught, she thus speaks to her sister, sharer of her heart: “Anna, my sister, what dreams thrill me with fears? Who is this stranger guest who has entered our home? How noble his mien! How brave in heart and feats of arms! I believe it well—nor is my confidence vain—that he is sprung from gods. It is fear that proves souls base-born. Alas! by what fates is he vexed! What wars, long endured, did he recount! Were the purpose not planted in my mind, fixed and immovable, to ally myself with none in bond of wedlock, since my first love, turning traitor, cheated me by death; were I not tired of the bridal bed and torch, to this one fault, perhaps, I might have yielded!

Do you think that dust or buried shades give heed to that? Grant that until now no wooers moved your sorrow, not in Libya, nor before then in Tyre; that Iarbas was slighted, and other lords whom the African land, rich in triumphs, rears; will you wrestle also with a love that pleases? And does it not come to your mind whose lands you have settled in? On this side Gaetulian cities, a race invincible in war, unbridled Numidians, and the unfriendly Syrtis hem you in; on that side lies a tract barren with drought, and Barcaeans, raging far and wide. Why speak of the wars rising from Tyre, and your brother’s threats . . . ? I certainly believe that it was with the gods’ favour and Juno’s aid that the Ilian ships held their course hither with the wind. What a city you will see rise here, my sister, what a realm, by reason of such a marriage! With Teucrian arms beside us, to what heights will Punic glory soar?

	With these words she fanned into flame the queen’s love-enkindled heart, put hope in her wavering mind, and loosed the bonds of shame. First they visit the shrines and sue for peace at every altar; duly they slay chosen sheep to Ceres the law-giver, to Phoebus and father Lyaeus, above all to Juno, guardian of the bonds of marriage. Dido herself, matchless in beauty, with cup in hand, pours libation midway between the horns of a white heifer, or in presence of the gods moves slowly to the rich altars, and day by day renews her gifts, then, gazing into the opened breasts of victims, consults the quivering entrails. Ah, the blind souls of seers! Of what avail are vows or shrines to one wild with love? All the while the flame devours her tender heartstrings, and deep in her breast lives the silent wound. Unhappy Dido burns, and through the city wanders in frenzy—even as a hind, smitten by an arrow, which, all unwary, amid the Cretan woods, a shepherd hunting with darts has pierced from afar, leaving in her the winged steel, unknowing: she in flight ranges the Dictaean woods and glades, but fast to her side clings the deadly shaft. Now through the city’s midst she leads Aeneas with her, and displays her Sidonian wealth and the city built; she begins to speak and stops with the word half-spoken. Now, as day wanes, she seeks that same banquet, again in her madness craves to hear the sorrows of Ilium and again hangs on the speaker’s lips. Then when all have gone their ways, and in

Though absent, each from each, she hears him, she sees him, or, captivated by his look of his father, she holds Ascanius on her lap, in case she may beguile a passion beyond all utterance. No longer rise the towers begun, no longer do the youth exercise in arms, or toil at havens or bulwarks for safety in war; the works are broken off and idle—great menacing walls and cranes that touch the sky.

	Soon as the loved wife of Jove saw that Dido was held in a passion so fatal, and that her good name was now no bar to her frenzy, the daughter of Saturn accosts Venus thus: “Splendid indeed is the praise and rich the spoils you win, you and your boy; mighty and glorious is the power divine, if one woman is subdued by the guile of two gods! Nay, it escapes me not how, in fear of our city, you have held in suspicion the homes of high Carthage. But what shall be the end? And what is the point of all this contest now? Why do we not rather strive for an enduring peace and a plighted wedlock? What you sought with all your heart you have; Dido is on fire with love and has drawn the madness through her veins. Let us then rule this people jointly with equal sovereignty; let her serve a Phrygian husband and yield her Tyrians to your power as dowry!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	To her—for she knew that with feigned purpose she had spoken, to turn the empire from Italy to Libya’s shores—Venus thus began in reply: “Who so mad as to refuse such terms, or prefer to strive against you in war, as long as Fortune favour the fulfilment of your word?

You are his wife; it is lawful for you to try to persuade his heart with entreaty. Go on; I will follow!” Then queenly Juno thus replied: “With me shall rest that task. Now in what way the present purpose can be achieved, hearken and I will explain in brief. Aeneas and unhappy Dido plan to go hunting together in the forest, as soon as tomorrow’s sun shows his rising and with his rays unveils the world. On them, while the hunters run to and fro and gird the glades with nets, I will pour down from above a black rain mingled with hail, and wake the whole welkin with thunder.

As the queen lingers in her bower, the Punic princes await her at the doorway; her prancing steed stands brilliant in purple and gold, and proudly champs the foaming bit. At last she comes forth, attended by a mighty throng, and clad in a Sidonian robe with embroidered border.

	Iulus. Aeneas himself, goodly beyond all others, advances to join her and unites his band with hers. As when Apollo quits Lycia, his winter home, and the streams of Xanthus, to visit his mother’s Delos, and renews the dance, while mingling about his altars Cretans and Dryopes and painted Agathyrsians raise their voices—he himself treads the Cynthian ridges, and with soft foliage shapes and binds his flowing locks, braiding it with golden diadem; the shafts rattle on his shoulders: so no less lightly than he went Aeneas, such beauty shines forth from his noble face! When they came to the mountain heights and pathless lairs, wild goats dislodged from the rocky peaks ran down the ridges; in another part stags scurry across the open moors and amid clouds of dust mass their bands in flight, as they leave the hills behind. But in the midst of the valleys the young Ascanius glories in his fiery steed, galloping past now these, now those, and prays that amid the timorous herds a foaming boar maybe granted to his vows or a tawny lion come down from the mountain.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Meanwhile in the sky begins the turmoil of a wild uproar; rain follows, mingled with hail. The scattered Tyrian train and the Trojan youth, with the Dardan grandson of Venus, in their fear seek shelter here and there over the fields; torrents rush down from the heights. To the same cave come Dido and the Trojan chief. Primal Earth and nuptial Juno give the sign; fires flashed in Heaven, the witness to their bridal, and on the mountaintop screamed the Nymphs. That day the first of death, the first of calamity was cause. For no more is Dido swayed by fair show or fair fame, no more does she dream of a secret love: she calls it marriage and with that name veils her sin.

	At once Rumour runs through Libya’s great cities—Rumour the swiftest of all evils. Speed lends her strength, and she wins vigour as she goes; small at first through fear, soon she mounts up to heaven, and walks the ground with head hidden in the clouds. Mother Earth, provoked to anger against the gods, brought her forth last, they say, as sister to Coeus and Enceladus, swift of foot and fleet of wing, a monster awful and huge, who for the many feathers in her body has as many watchful eyes beneath—wondrous to tell—as many tongues, as many sounding mouths, as many pricked-up ears. By night, midway between heaven and earth, she flies through the gloom, screeching, and droops not her eyes in sweet sleep; by day she sits on guard on high rooftop or lofty turrets, and affrights great cities, clinging to the false and wrong, yet heralding truth. Now exulting in manifold gossip, she filled the nations and sang alike of fact and falsehood, how Aeneas is come, one born of Trojan blood, to whom in marriage fair Dido deigns to join herself; now they while away the winter, all its length, in wanton ease together, heedless of their realms and enthralled by shameless passion. These tales the foul goddess spreads here and there upon the lips of men. Straightway to King Iarbas she bends her course, and with her words fires his spirit and heaps high his wrath.

	He, the son of Hammon by a ravished Garamantian Nymph, set up to Jupiter in his broad realms a hundred vast temples, a hundred altars, and had hallowed the wakeful fire, the eternal sentry of the gods. The ground was fat with the blood of beasts and the portals bloomed with varied garlands. Distraught in mind and fired with the bitter

	tale, they say, before the altars and amid the divine presences he often besought Jove in prayer with upturned hands: “Almighty Jupiter, to whom now the Moorish race, feasting on embroidered couches, pour a Lenaean offering, do you see these things? Is it vainly, father, that we shudder at you, when you hurl your thunderbolts? And do aimless fires amid the clouds terrify our souls and stir murmurs void of purpose? This woman who, straying in our bounds, set up a tiny city at a price, to whom we gave coastland to plough and terms of tenure, has spurned my offers of marriage, and welcomed Aeneas into her realm as lord. And now that Paris with his eunuch train, his chin and perfumed locks bound with a Lydian turban,
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] grasps the spoil; while we bring offerings to your temples, yours forsooth, and cherish an idle story.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As with such words he pleaded, clasping the altars, the Almighty gave ear and turned his eyes on the royal city and the lovers forgetful of their nobler fame. Then thus to Mercury he speaks and gives this charge: “Go forth, my son, call the Zephyrs, glide on thy wings, and speak to the Dardan chief, who now at Carthage is looking forward to Tyrian cities, unmindful of those granted him by the Fates; so carry down my words through the swift winds. Not such as this did his lovely mother promise him to us, nor for this twice rescue him from Grecian arms; but he it was who should rule Italy, a land teeming with empire and clamorous with war, hand on a race from Teucer’s noble blood, and bring all the world beneath his laws.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	He ceased. The god made ready to obey his mighty father’s bidding, and first binds on his feet the golden shoes which carry him upborne on wings over seas or land, swift as the gale. Then he takes his wand; with this he calls pale ghosts from Orcus and sends others down to gloomy Tartarus, gives or takes away sleep and unseals eyes in death;
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] relying on this, he drives the winds and skims the stormy clouds. And now in flight he descries the peak and steep sides of toiling Atlas, who props heaven on his peak—Atlas, whose pine-wreathed head is ever girt with black clouds, and beaten with wind and rain; fallen snow mantles his shoulders while rivers plunge down the aged chin and his rough beard is stiff with ice. Here, poised on even wings, the Cyllenian first halted; hence with his whole frame he sped sheer down to the waves like a bird, which round the shores, round the fish-haunted cliffs, flies low near to the waters. Even thus between earth and sky flew Cyllene’s nursling to Libya’s sandy shore, and cut the winds, coming from his mother’s sire.

	So soon as with winged feet he reached the huts, he sees Aeneas founding towers and building new houses. And his sword was starred with yellow jasper, and a cloak hung from his shoulders ablaze with Tyrian purple—a gift that wealthy Dido had wrought, interweaving the web with

With never a thought of your own realm and fate! The ruler of the gods himself, who sways heaven and earth with his power, sends me down to you from bright Olympus. He himself bids me bring this charge through the swift breezes: What are you planning? In what hope do you waste idle hours in Libyan lands? If the glory of such a fortune does not stir you, [c dimgray]and for your own fame’s sake you do not shoulder the burden,[/c] have regard for growing Ascanius, the promise of Iulus your heir, to whom the kingdom of Italy and the Roman land are due.” Such words the Cyllenian spoke, and while yet speaking left the sight of men and far away from their eyes vanished into thin air.

What opening words choose first? And as he casts his swift mind this way and that, takes it in different directions and considers every possibility, this, as he wavered, seemed the better counsel; he calls Mnestheus and Sergestus, bidding them make ready the fleet in silence, gather the crews to the shore, and order the armament, but hide the cause of his altered plans.

At least, if before your flight a child of yours had been born to me, if in my hall a baby Aeneas were playing, whose face, in spite of all, would bring back yours, I should not think myself utterly vanquished and forlorn.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	She ceased: he by Jove’s command held his eyes steadfast and with a struggle smothered the pain deep within his heart. At last he briefly replies: “I will never deny, Queen, that you have deserved of me the utmost you can set forth in speech, nor shall my memory of Elissa be bitter, while I have memory of myself, and while breath governs these limbs. For my conduct few words will I say. I did not hope—think not that—to veil my flight in stealth. I never held out a bridegroom’s torch or entered such a compact. Had destiny permitted me to shape my life after my own pleasure and order my sorrows at my own will, my first care would be the city of Troy and the sweet relics of my king. Priam’s high house would still abide and my own hand would have set up a revived Pergamus for the vanquished. But now of great Italy has Grynean Apollo bidden me lay hold, of Italy the Lycian oracles.

Now, too, the messenger of the gods sent from Jove himself—I swear by both our lives—has borne his command down through the swift breezes; my own eyes saw the god in the clear light of day come within our walls and these ears drank in his words. Cease to inflame yourself and me with your complaints. It is not by my wish that I make for Italy . . .”

	As thus he spoke, all the while she gazes on him askance, turning her eyes to and fro, and with silent glances scans the whole man; then thus, inflamed, cries out: “False one, no goddess was your mother, nor was Dardanus founder of your line, but rugged Caucasus on his flinty rocks begot you, and Hyrcanian tigresses suckled you. For why hide my feelings? For what greater wrongs do I hold myself back? Did he sigh while I wept? Did he turn on me a glance? Did he yield and shed tears or pity her who loved him? What shall I say first? What next? Now, neither mighty Juno nor the Saturnian sire looks on these things with righteous eyes! Nowhere is faith secure. I welcomed him, a castaway on the shore, a beggar, and madly gave him a share in my throne; his lost fleet I rescued, his crews I saved from death. Alas! I am whirled on the fires of frenzy. Now prophetic Apollo, now the Lycian oracles, now the messenger of the gods sent from Jove himself, brings through the air this dread command.

Though far away, I will chase you with murky brands and, when chill death has severed soul and body, everywhere my shade shall haunt you. Relentless one, you will repay! I shall hear, and the tale will reach me in the depths of the world below!” So saying, she breaks off her speech midway and flees in anguish from the light, turning away, tearing herself from his sight, and leaving him in fear and much hesitance, and ready to say much. Her maids support her, carry her swooning form to her marble bower, and lay her on her bed.

	But loyal Aeneas, though longing to soothe and assuage her grief and by his words turn aside her sorrow, with many a sigh, his soul shaken by his mighty love, yet fulfils Heaven’s bidding and returns to the fleet. Then, indeed, the Teucrians fall to and all along the shore launch their tall ships. The keels, well-pitched, are set afloat; the sailors, eager for flight, bring from the woods leafy boughs for oars and logs unhewn . . . One could see them moving away and streaming forth from all the city. Even as when ants, mindful of winter, plunder a huge heap of corn and store it in their home; over the plain moves a black column, and through the grass they carry the spoil on a narrow track; some strain with their shoulders and heave on the huge grains, some close up the ranks and rebuke delay; all the path is aglow with work.

	“Anna, you see the bustle all along the shore; from all sides they have gathered; already the canvas invites the breeze, and the joyous sailors have crowned the sterns with garlands. If I have had strength to foresee this great sorrow, I shall also, sister, have strength to endure it. Yet this one service, Anna, do for me—for you alone that traitor made his friend, to you he confided even his secret thoughts, you alone will know the hour for easy access to him—go, sister, and humbly address our haughty foe. I never conspired with the Danaans at Aulis to root out the Trojan race; I never sent a fleet to Pergamus, nor tore up the ashes and disturbed the spirit of his father Anchises. Why does he refuse to admit my words to his stubborn ears? Whither does he hasten? This, the last boon, let him grant his poor lover: let him await an easy flight and favouring winds. No more do I plead for the old marriage tie which he forswore, nor that he give up fair Latium and resign his realm: for empty time I ask, for peace and reprieve for my frenzy, till fortune teach my vanquished soul to grieve. This last grace I crave—pity your sister—which, when he has granted it, I will repay with full interest in my death.”

Even as when northern Alpine winds, blowing now hence, now thence, emulously strive to uproot an oak strong with the strength of years, there comes a roar, the trunk quivers and the high leafage thickly strews the ground, but the oak clings to the crag, and as far as it lifts its top to the airs of heaven, so far it strikes its roots down towards hell—even so with ceaseless appeals, from this side and from that, the hero is buffeted, and in his mighty heart feels agony: his mind stands steadfast; his tears fall without effect.

	Then, indeed, awed by her doom, luckless Dido prays for death; she is weary of gazing on the arch of heaven. And to make her more surely fulfil her purpose and leave the light, she saw, as she laid her gifts on the altars ablaze with incense—fearful to tell—the holy water darken and the outpoured wine change into loathsome gore. Of this sight she spoke to no one—not even her sister. Moreover, there was in the palace a marble chapel to her former lord, which she cherished in wondrous honour, wreathing it with snowy fleeces and festal foliage. Thence she heard, it seemed, sounds and speech as of her husband calling, whenever darkling night held the world; and alone on the housetops with ill-boding song the owl would oft complain, drawing out its lingering notes into a wail; and likewise many a saying of the seers of old terrifies her with fearful boding. In her sleep fierce Aeneas himself drives her in her frenzy; and ever she seems to be left lonely,

Near Ocean’s bound and the setting sun lies Ethiopia, farthest of lands, where mightiest Atlas on his shoulders turns the sphere, inset with gleaming stars. Thence a priestess of Massylian race has been shown me, warden of the fane of the Hesperides, who gave dainties to the dragon and guarded the sacred boughs on the tree, sprinkling dewy honey and slumbrous poppies. With her spells she professes to set free the hearts of whom she wills, but on others to bring cruel love pains; to stay the flow of rivers and turn back the stars; she awakes the ghosts of night; and you will see earth rumbling under your feet and ash trees coming down from mountains. I call heaven to witness and you, dear sister mine, and your dear life, that against my will I arm myself with magic arts!

So she makes ready as bidden . . .

	But the queen, when in the heart of her home the pyre rose heavenward, piled high with pine logs and hewn ilex, hangs the place with garlands and crowns it with funeral boughs. On top, upon the couch, she lays the dress he wore, the sword he left, and an image of him, knowing what was to come. Round about stand altars, and with streaming hair the priestess calls in thunder tones on thrice a hundred gods, Erebos and Chaos, and threefold Hecate, triple-faced maiden Diana. Waters, too, she had sprinkled feigned to be from the spring Avernus, and herbs were sought, cut by moonlight with brazen sickles, and juicy with milk of black venom; sought, too, was the love charm, torn from the brow of a colt at birth before the mother snatched it . . . She herself, with holy meal and holy hands, stood beside the altars, one foot unsandalled and girdle loosened; soon to die, she calls on the gods and on the stars, witnesses of her doom; then she prays to whatever power, righteous and mindful, watches over lovers unequally allied.

	It was night, and over the earth weary creatures were tasting the peace of slumber; the woods and wild seas had sunk to rest—the hour when stars roll midway in their gliding course, when all the land is still, and beasts and coloured

[c dimgray]They were soothing their cares, their hearts oblivious of sorrows.[/c] But not so the soul-racked Phoenician queen; she never sinks into sleep, nor draws darkness into eyes or heart. Her pangs redouble, and her love, swelling up, surges afresh, as she heaves with a mighty tide of passion. Thus then she begins, and thus alone revolves her thoughts in her heart: “See, what am I to do? Shall I once more make trial of my old wooers, only to be mocked, and shall I humbly sue for marriage with Numidians, whom I have scorned so often as husbands? Shall I then follow the Ilian ships and the Trojan’s uttermost commands? Is it because they are thankful for aid once given, and gratitude for past kindness stands firm in their mindful hearts? But who—suppose that I wished it—will suffer me, or take one so hated on those haughty ships? Ah! lost one, do you not yet understand nor perceive the treason of Laomedon’s race? What then? Shall I on my own accompany the exultant sailors in their flight? Or, surrounded by all my Tyrian band, shall I pursue, and shall I again drive seaward the men whom I could scarce tear from the Sidonian city, and bid them unfurl their sails to the winds? Nay, die as you deserve, and with the sword end your sorrow. Won over by my tears, you, my sister, you were the first to load my frenzied soul with these ills, and drive me on the foe. Ah, that I could not spend my life apart from wedlock, a blameless life, like some wild creature, and not know such cares! The faith vowed to the ashes of Sychaeus I have not kept.” Such were the cries that kept bursting from her heart.

	resolved on going, Aeneas was snatching sleep on his vessel’s high stern. In his sleep there appeared to him a vision of the god, as he came again with the same aspect, and once more seemed to warn him thus, in all aspects like Mercury, in voice and colouring, in golden hair and the graceful limbs of youth: “Goddess-born, when such hazard threatens, can you still slumber? Do you not see the perils that from henceforth hem you in, madman? Do you not hear the kindly breezes blowing? She, resolved on death, revolves in her heart fell craft and crime, and awakens the swirling surge of passion. Will you not flee hence in haste, while hasty flight is possible? Soon you will see the waters a welter of timbers, see fierce brands ablaze, and soon the shore flashing with flames, if dawn finds you lingering in these lands. Up then, break off delay! A fickle and changeful thing is woman ever.” So he spoke and melted into the black night.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then indeed Aeneas, scared by the sudden vision, tears himself from sleep and bestirs his comrades. “Make haste, my men, awake and man the benches! Unfurl the sails with speed! A god sent from high heaven again spurs us to hasten our flight and cut the twisted cables. We follow you, holy among gods, whoever you are, and again joyfully obey your command. Oh, be with us, give your gracious aid, and in the sky vouchsafe kindly stars!” He spoke, and from its sheath snatches his flashing sword and strikes the hawser with the drawn blade. The same zeal catches all at once; with hurry and scurry they have quitted the shore; the sea is hidden under their fleets; lustily they churn the foam and sweep the blue waters.

	And now early Dawn, leaving the saffron bed of Tithonus, was sprinkling her fresh rays upon the earth. Soon as the queen from her watchtower saw the light whiten and the fleet move on with even sails, and knew the shores and harbours were void of oarsmen, thrice and four times she struck her comely breast with her hand, and tearing her golden hair, “O God,” she cries, “shall he go? Shall the intruder have made of our realm a laughingstock? Will pursuers not fetch arms and give chase from all the city, and some of them speed ships from the docks? Go, haste to bring fire, serve arms, ply oars! What say I? Where am I? What madness turns my brain? Unhappy Dido, do only now your sinful deeds come home to you? Then was the time, when you gave your crown away. Behold the pledge and promise of him who, so they say, carries with him his ancestral gods and bore his worn-out father on his shoulders! Could I not have seized him, torn him limb from limb, and scattered the pieces on the waves? Could I not have put his men to the sword, and Ascanius himself, and served him up as a meal at his father’s table? But perhaps the issue of battle had been doubtful? Suppose it had been: doomed to death, whom had I to fear? I should have carried fire into his camp, filled his decks with flame, blotted out father and son together with the whole race, and immolated myself on top of all. O Sun, whose rays survey all that is done on earth; and Juno, agent and witness of my unhappy love; Hecate, whose name is wailed by night in city streets; and Avenging Furies and gods of dying Elissa: hear me now; turn your anger upon the sins that merit it, and listen to my prayers!

Nor yet, when he has submitted to the terms of an unjust peace, may he enjoy his kingship or the life he longs for, but perish before his time and lie unburied on a lonely strand! This is my prayer; this last utterance I pour out with my blood. Then do you, Tyrians, persecute with hate his stock and all the race to come, and to my dust offer this tribute! Let no love or treaty unite the nations! Arise from my ashes, unknown avenger, to harass the Trojan settlers with fire and sword—today, hereafter, whenever strength be ours! May coast with coast conflict, I pray, and sea with sea, arms with arms; war may they have, themselves and their children’s children!”

	With this curse she turned her mind in every direction, seeking how most quickly to end the life she loathed. Then briefly she addressed Barce, the nurse of Sychaeus, for the pyre’s black ashes held her own back in her country of long ago. “Dear nurse, bring my sister Anna here. Bid her hasten to sprinkle her body with river water and bring with her the victims and offerings ordained for atonement. This done, let her come; and veil your brows, too, with a pure chaplet. I am minded to fulfil the rites of Stygian Jove
	[m1]\ [/m]
	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c]The curse is a prophecy, foretelling that Aeneas will be attacked and harassed by the Rutulians, separated from his son, forced to seek Evander’s help, will suffer the deaths of dear friends, and be forced to submit to a peace which sacrifices the name of Troy. So far the later books of the [c dimgray]Aeneid.[/c] Legend told that his reign was brief and that he met an unnatural death at the river Numicius, his body disappearing and so not given burial. The unknown avenger is Hannibal, leader of the Carthaginians. Dido’s closure on a hypermetric line suggests most effectively the never-ending enmity between her descendants and Aeneas’.

But Dido, trembling and frantic with her dreadful design, rolling bloodshot eyes, her quivering cheeks flecked with burning spots, and pale at the imminence of death, bursts into the inner courts of the house, climbs the high pyre in a frenzy and unsheathes the Dardan sword, a gift sought for no such purpose. Then, as she saw the Trojan garb and the familiar bed, pausing awhile in tearful thought, she threw herself on the couch and spoke her last words: “O relics once dear, while God and Fate allowed, take my spirit, and release me from my woes! My life is done and I have finished the course that Fortune gave; and now in majesty my shade shall pass beneath the earth. A noble city I have built; my own walls I have seen; avenging my husband, I have exacted punishment from my brother and foe—happy, too happy, had but the Dardan keels never touched our shores!” She spoke, and burying her face in the couch, “I shall die unavenged,” she cries, “but let me die! Thus, thus I go gladly into the dark! Let the cruel Dardan’s eyes drink in this fire from the deep, and carry with him the omen of my death!”

	Swooning, her sister heard, and in dismay rushed through the throng, tearing her face with her nails, and beating her breast with her fists, as she called on the dying woman by name. “Was this your purpose, sister? Did you aim your fraud at me? Was this for me the meaning of your pyre, this the meaning of your altar and fires? Forlorn, what shall I first lament? Did you scorn in death your sister’s company? You should have summoned me to share your fate; the same sword stroke, the same moment would have taken us both! Did these hands indeed build the pyre, and did my voice call on our father’s gods, in order that, when you were lying thus, I, cruel one, should be far away? You have destroyed yourself and me together, sister, the Sidonian senate and people, and your city! Bring me water to bathe her wounds and catch with my lips whatever last breath may linger!” Thus speaking, she had climbed the high steps, and, throwing her arms round her dying sister, sobbed and clasped her to her bosom, stanching with her dress the dark streams of blood. She, trying to lift her heavy eyes, swoons again, and the deep-set wound gurgles in her breast. Thrice rising, she struggled to prop herself on her elbow, thrice on the bed rolled back, with wandering eyes sought high heaven’s light, and when she found it, moaned.

	Then almighty Juno, pitying her long agony and painful dying, sent Iris down from heaven to release her struggling soul from the prison of her flesh. For since she perished neither in the course of fate nor by a death she

	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] So Iris on dewy saffron wings flits down through the sky, trailing athwart the sun a thousand shifting tints, and halted above her head. “This offering, sacred to Dis, I take as bidden, and from your body set you free”: so she speaks and with her hand severs the lock; and therewith all the warmth passed away, and the life vanished into the winds.

	Meanwhile Aeneas with his fleet was now holding steadfastly his mid-sea course, and cleaving the waves that darkened under the north wind, looking back on the city walls which now gleam with unhappy Elissa’s funeral flames. What cause kindled so great a flame is unknown; but the cruel pangs when deep love is profaned, and knowledge of what a woman can do in frenzy, lead the hearts of the Trojans amid sad forebodings.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When the ships gained the deep and no longer any land is in sight, but sea on all sides and on all sides sky, then overhead loomed a black rain cloud, bringing night and tempest, and the wave shuddered darkling. Even the helmsman Palinurus cries from the high stern: “Alas! why have such clouds girt the heaven? What have you in mind, Father Neptune?” So he cries, and straightway bids them gather in the tackling and bend to their stout oars, then turns the sails aslant the wind and thus speaks: “Noble Aeneas, not even if Jupiter should use his authority to guarantee it, could I hope to reach Italy with such a sky. The winds have shifted and roar athwart our course, gathering from the black west; the air thickens into cloud and we cannot resist or stem the gale. Since Fortune is victor, let us follow and turn our course whither she calls. Nor far distant, I think, are the friendly shores of your brother

	Eryx and the Sicilian ports, if my memory prove true as I retrace the stars I watched before.” Then loyal Aeneas: “I myself have long seen that the winds will so have it, and that in vain you steer against them. Shift the sails to a new course. Could any land be more welcome to me, any to which I would sooner steer my weary ships, than that which holds my Dardan friend Acestes, and enfolds in her embrace my father Anchises’ ashes?” This said, they make for harbour, and favouring Zephyrs fill their sails; the fleet runs swiftly on the flood, and at last they gladly turn to the familiar shore.

	But afar off, on a high hilltop, Acestes marvels at the coming of friendly ships and hastens towards them, bristling with weapons and a Libyan she-bear’s skin—Acestes, born of a Trojan mother to the river god Crimisus. Not unmindful of his old lineage, he bids them joy on their return, gladly welcomes them with rustic wealth, and comforts their weariness with friendly cheer.

	When on the morrow at early dawn bright day had put the stars to rout, Aeneas calls his comrades from all the shore together and speaks from a mounded eminence: “Great sons of Dardanus, born of heaven’s high race, with the passing of the months the circling year draws to an end since we laid in earth the dust, all that was left, of my divine father, and hallowed the altars of grief. And now, if I err not, the day is at hand which I shall keep (such, O gods, was your will) ever as a day of grief, ever as a day of honour.

Come then, one and all, and let us solemnize the sacrifice with joy; let us pray for winds and may he grant that year by year when my city is founded I may offer these rites in temples consecrated to him! Two head of oxen Acestes, of Trojan birth, gives you for every ship; summon to the feast both your own hearth gods and those whom our host Acestes worships. Moreover, should the ninth Dawn lift her kindly light for mortals and with her rays lay bare the world, I will ordain contests for the Trojans: first of the swift ships; then whoever excels in the footrace, and who, bold in his strength, steps forward superior with the javelin and light shafts, or who dares to join battle with gloves of raw hide—let all appear and look for the palm, the prize of victory.

Here in due libation he pours on the ground two goblets of unmixed wine, two of fresh milk, two of the blood of victims, and showering bright blossoms, thus he cries: “Hail, holy father, once again; hail, ashes, rescued though in vain, and you, soul and shade of my sire! Not with you was I suffered to seek the destined bounds and fields of Italy, nor Ausonian Tiber, whatever that name imports.” So had he spoken, when from the foot of the shrine a slippery serpent trailed seven huge coils, fold upon fold seven times, peacefully

	circling the mound and gliding among the altars; his back chequered with blue spots, and his scales ablaze with the sheen of dappled gold, as in the clouds the rainbow darts a thousand shifting tints athwart the sun. Aeneas was awestruck at the sight. At last, sliding with long train amid the bowls and polished cups, the serpent tasted the viands, and again, all harmless, crept beneath the tomb, leaving the altars where he fed. More eagerly, therefore, does he renew his father’s interrupted rites, knowing not whether to deem it the genius of the place or the attendant spirit of his sire. Two sheep he slays, as is meet, two swine, and as many dark-backed heifers, while he poured wine from bowls and called great Anchises’ shade and the ghost released from Acheron. Moreover, his comrades, as each has store, gladly bring gifts, heap the altars and slay the steers; others in turn set the cauldrons and, spreading over the grass, put live coals under the spits and roast the flesh.

First of all the prizes are laid out to view in the midst of the course—sacred tripods, green garlands and palms, the victors’ reward; armour and purple-dyed garments, with a talent’s weight of silver and gold.

Here as a mark father Aeneas set up a green goal of leafy ilex, for the sailors to know whence to return and where to double round the long course. Then they choose places by lot, and on the sterns the captains themselves shine forth afar in glory of gold and purple; the rest of the crews are crowned with poplar wreaths, and their naked shoulders glisten, moist with oil. They man the thwarts, their arms strained to the oars; straining, they await the signal, while throbbing fear and eager passion for glory drain each bounding heart. Then, when the clear trumpet sounded, all at once shot forth from their starting places; the mariners’ shouts strike the heavens; as arms are drawn back the waters are turned into foam.

And now they neared the rock and were close to the turn, when Gyas, still first, and leader in the half-course, loudly hails his ship’s pilot, Menoetes: “Whither, man, so far off to the right? Direct her path this way; hug the shore, and let the oar blade graze the rocks on the left; let others keep to the deep!” He spoke; but Menoetes, fearing hidden rocks, wrenches the prow aside towards the open sea. “Whither so far off the course? Make for the rocks, Menoetes!” again shouted Gyas to call him back; when lo! he sees Cloanthus hard behind and keeping the nearer course. Between Gyas’ ship and the roaring rocks he grazes his way nearer in on the left, suddenly passes his leader, and leaving the goal

	behind gains safe water. Then indeed anger burned deep in the young man’s frame; tears sprang to his cheeks, and heedless alike of his own pride and his crew’s safety, he heaves timid Menoetes from the high stern sheer into the sea; himself steersman and captain, he steps to the helm, cheers on his men, and turns the rudder shoreward. But Menoetes, when with difficulty he rose at last from the sea bottom, old as he was and dripping in his drenched clothes, made heavily for the top of the crag and sat down on the dry rock. The Teucrians laughed as he fell and swam, and they laugh as he spews the salt waters from his chest.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Here a joyful hope was kindled in the two behind, Sergestus and Mnestheus, to pass the laggard Gyas. Sergestus takes the lead and nears the rock; but he is ahead not by a whole boat’s length; he leads by a part, but the rival Dragon overlaps a part with her prow. Then, pacing amidships among his crew, Mnestheus cheers them on: “Now, now, rise to the oars, comrades of Hector, you whom in Troy’s last hour I chose as my followers; now put forth that strength, that courage, which you showed in Gaetulian quicksands, on the Ionian sea, and amid Malea’s racing waves! No longer do I, Mnestheus, seek the first place, no longer do I strive to win; yet oh!—but let those conquer to whom you, Neptune, have granted it—it would be shame to return last! Win but this, my countrymen, and ward off disgrace!” Straining to the utmost, his men bend forward; with their mighty strokes the brazen poop quivers, and the sea floor flies from under them. Then rapid panting shakes their limbs and parched mouths, and sweat streams

	down all their limbs. Mere chance brought them the glory they craved. For while Sergestus, mad at heart, drives his prow inward towards the rocks and enters on the perilous course, he stuck on a jutting reef. The cliffs were jarred, on the sharp flint the oars struck and snapped; the bow hung where it crashed. Up spring the sailors and, clamouring loudly at the delay, get out iron-shod pikes and sharp-pointed poles, or rescued from the flood their broken oars. But Mnestheus, cheered and enlivened by his very success, with swift play of oars and a prayer to the winds, seeks the shoreward waters and glides down the open sea. Just as, if startled suddenly from her cave, a dove whose home and sweet nestlings are in the rocky coverts, wings her flight to the fields and, frightened from her home, flaps loudly with her wings; soon, gliding in the peaceful air, she skims her liquid way and stirs not her swift pinions—so Mnestheus, so the Dragon of herself, cleaves in flight the final stretch, so her mere speed carries her on her winged course. And first he leaves Sergestus behind, struggling on the high rock and in shallow waters, making vain appeals for help and learning to race with broken oars. Then he overhauls Gyas, even the Chimaera with her huge bulk; she gives way, robbed of her helmsman.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And now, hard on the very goal, Cloanthus alone is left. For him Mnestheus makes, striving with all his might and pressing hard. Then indeed the shouts redouble, all together with cheers hearten the pursuer, the sky echoes to their din. These think it shame not to keep the honour that is theirs, the glory they have won, and would barter life for fame: those success heartens; strong are they, for strong they deem themselves. And now that their prows were abreast, they might perhaps have won the prize, had

Scarce could the servants, Phegeus and Sagaris, bear its folds with straining shoulders; yet, clad in this, Demoleos of yore drove full speed the scattered Trojans. The third prize he makes a pair of brazen cauldrons, and bowls wrought in silver and rough with reliefs.

	And now all had their gifts and, proud of their wealth, were going their way, their brows bound with purple fillets, when with great difficulty, by dint of much skill, cleared from the cruel rocks, oars lost, and one tier crippled, Sergestus, amid jeers, brought in his inglorious barque. Just as often, when caught on the highway, a serpent which a brazen wheel has crossed aslant, or with blow of a heavy stone a wayfarer has crushed and left half-dead, vainly tries to escape and trails its long coils; part defiant, his eyes ablaze and his hissing neck raised aloft; part, maimed by the wound, holding him back, as he twists in coils and twines himself upon his own limbs—with such oarage, the ship moved slowly on; but it hoists sail and under full sail makes the harbour’s mouth. Aeneas presents Sergestus with his promised reward, glad that the ship is saved and the crew brought back. A slave-woman is given him, not unskilled in Minerva’s tasks, Pholoë of Cretan stock, with twin boys at her breast.

	This contest sped, loyal Aeneas moves to a grassy plain, girt all about with winding hills, well-wooded, where, at the heart of the valley, ran the circuit of a theatre. To this spot, with many thousands, the hero betook himself into the midst of the company and sat down on a raised seat.

	Here, for any who might perhaps wish to vie in speed of foot, he lures valour with hope of rewards and sets up prizes. From all sides flock Trojans and Sicilians among them, Nisus and Euryalus foremost . . . Euryalus famed for beauty and flower of youth, Nisus for tender love for the boy. Next followed princely Diores, of Priam’s noble race; then Salius and Patron together; of these one was an Acarnanian, the other of Arcadian blood, a Tegean born; then two Sicilian youths, Helymus and Panopes, inured to the forests and attendants on old Acestes; with many besides, whose fame is hidden in darkness. Then in their midst Aeneas thus spoke: “Take these words to heart and pay cheerful heed. None of this number shall leave without a gift from me. To each will I give two Cretan arrows, gleaming with polished steel, and an axe chased with silver to bear away; all alike shall have this same reward. The three first shall receive prizes, and have pale-green olive crown their heads. Let the first take as winner a horse splendid with trappings; the second an Amazonian quiver, filled with Thracian arrows, girt about with a broad belt of gold and clasped by a buckle with polished gem; with this Argive helmet let the third depart content.”

	This said, they take their place, and suddenly, the signal heard, dash over the course, and leave the barrier, streaming forth like a storm-cloud. As soon as they sight the goal, away goes Nisus first, and far in front of all darts forth, swifter than the winds or than winged thunderbolt. Next to him, but next by a long distance, follows Salius; then, with some space left between them, Euryalus third . . . and,

And had more of the course remained, he would have shot past him to the fore or left the issue in doubt. And now, with course well-nigh covered, panting they neared the very goal, when Nisus, luckless one, falls in some slippery blood, which, spilt by chance where steers were slain, had soaked the ground and greensward. Here, even in the joy of triumph, the youth could not hold his stumbling steps on the ground he trod, but fell prone, right in the filthy slime and blood of sacrifice. Yet not of Euryalus, not of his love was he forgetful; for as he rose amid the sodden ground he threw himself in the way of Salius, who, rolling over, fell prostrate on the clotted sand. Euryalus darts by and, winning by grace of his friend, takes first place, and flies on amid favouring applause and cheers. Behind come Helymus, and Diores, now third prize.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Hereupon Salius fills with loud clamour the whole concourse of the great theatre and the gazing elders in front, claiming that the prize wrested from him by fraud be given back. Good will befriends Euryalus, and his seemly tears and worth, that shows more winsome in a fair form. Diores backs him, making loud protest; he has reached the palm, but in vain won the last prize, if the highest honours are restored to Salius. Then said father Aeneas: “Your rewards remain assured to you, my lads, and no one alters the prizes’ order; be it mine to pity the mischance of a hapless friend!” So saying, he gives to Salius the huge hide of a Gaetulian lion, heavy with shaggy hair and gilded claws.

	Then said Nisus: “If such be the prize for defeat, and you have pity for the fallen, what fit reward will you give Nisus? The first crown I had earned by merit, had not Fortune’s malice fallen on me, as on Salius.” And with these words he displayed his face and limbs foul with wet filth. The gracious father smiled on him and bade a shield be brought out, the handiwork of Didymaon, that Greeks had taken down from Neptune’s hallowed doorway. This he bestows on the noble youth, a lordly prize.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then, when the races were ended and the gifts assigned, “Now,” he cries, “whoever has valour in his breast and a stout heart, let him come and lift up his arms with hidebound hands.” So he speaks, and sets forth a double prize for the fray; for the victor, a steer decked with gold and fillets; a sword and noble helmet to console the vanquished. Forthwith, without delay, Dares shows himself in all his huge strength, rising amid a mighty murmuring of the throng—Dares, who alone was wont to face Paris: he it was who, by the mound where great Hector lies, smote the champion Butes, offspring of Amycus’ Bebrycian race, as he strode forward in his huge bulk, and stretched him dying on the yellow sand. Such was Dares, who at once raises his head high for the fray, displays his broad shoulders, stretches his arms, spars right and left, and lashes the air with blows. For him a match is sought; but none from all that throng durst face him or draw the gloves on to his hands. So, exultant and thinking all resign the prize, he stood before Aeneas’ feet; then, tarrying no longer, grasps the bull by the horn with his left hand, speaking thus:

	“Entelle, heroum quondam fortissime frustra,

	obstipuere animi: tantorum ingentia septem

	“Goddess-born, if no man dare trust himself to the fray, what end shall there be to my standing here? How long is it fitting to keep me waiting? Bid me lead your gift away!” At once all the Dardans shouted applause, and bade the promised prize be duly given him.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At this Acestes sternly chides Entellus, as he sat next him on the green couch of grass: “Entellus, once bravest of heroes, though in vain, will you so tamely let gifts so great be carried off without a struggle? Where now, pray, is the divine Eryx, whom you called your teacher—all in vain? Where is your renown over all Sicily, and those spoils that hung in your house?” At this he said: “No cowardice has banished love of honour or thought of renown; but my blood is chilled and dulled by sluggish age, and my strength of body is numb and lifeless. Had I that which once I had, in which yonder braggart boldly exults—had I now that youth, then not from lure of prize or goodly steer would I have come forward, nor care I for gifts!” So he spoke and thereon threw into the ring a pair of gloves of giant weight, wherewith valiant Eryx was wont to enter contests, binding his arms with the tough hide. Amazed were the hearts of all, so vast were the seven huge oxhides, all stiff with insewn lead and iron. Above all Dares himself is dazed and, shrinking back, declines the contest; while Anchises’ noble son turns this way and that the thongs’ huge and ponderous folds. Then the old man spoke thus from his breast: “What if any had seen the gloves and arms of Hercules himself, and the fatal feud on this very shore? These arms your brother Eryx once wore; you see them still stained with blood and spattered brains. With these he faced great Alcides; with these was I wont to fight, while

	sounder blood gave me strength, nor yet had envious age sprinkled my temples with snow. But if the Trojan Dares declines these weapons of ours, and this is resolved on by good Aeneas and approved by my patron Acestes, let us make the battle even. At your wish I waive the gauntlets of Eryx; dismiss your fears; and take off your Trojan gloves!” So speaking, from his shoulders he threw back his twofold cloak, stripped his great joints and limbs, his great bones and thews, and stood a giant in the arena’s midst.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then, with a father’s care, the son of Anchises brought out gloves of like weight and with equal weapons bound the hands of both. Straightway each took his stand, poised on his toes, and, undaunted, lifted his arms high in air. Raising their heads high and drawing them far back from blows, they spar, hand with hand, and provoke the fray, the one nimbler of foot and confident in his youth, the other mighty in massive limbs; yet his slow knees totter and tremble and a painful gasping shakes his huge frame. Many hard blows they launch at each other to no avail, but many they rain on hollow flank, while their chests ring loudly; hands flash about ears and brows, and cheeks rattle under the hard strokes. Solidly stands Entellus, motionless, unmoved in stance, shunning blows with body and watchful eyes alone. The other, like one who assails some high city with siege works or besets a mountain stronghold in arms, tries now this approach and now that, skilfully ranges over all the ground, and presses with varied but vain assaults. Then Entellus, rising, put forth his right, lifted high; the other speedily foresaw the down-coming blow and, slipping aside with nimble body, foiled it. Entellus spent his strength on air, and in his huge bulk this mighty

	man fell in his might to earth, as at times falls on Erymanthus or mighty Ida a hollow pine, uptorn by the roots. Eagerly the Teucrians and men of Sicily rise up; a shout mounts to heaven, and first Acestes runs forward, and in pity raises his aged friend from the ground. But neither downcast nor dismayed by the fall, the hero returns keener to the fray, and rouses violence with wrath. Shame, too, and conscious valour kindle his strength, and in fury he drives Dares headlong over the whole arena, redoubling his blows, now with the right hand, and now with the left. No stint, no stay is there—thick as the hail when storm clouds rattle on the roof, so thick are the blows from either hand as the hero beats and batters Dares.

	Then father Aeneas suffered not their fury to go farther, nor Entellus to rage in bitterness of soul, but set an end to the fray and rescued the sore-spent Dares, speaking thus in soothing words: “Unhappy man! How could such frenzy seize your mind? Do you not see the strength is another’s and the gods are changed? Yield to heaven!” He spoke, and with his voice broke off the fight. But Dares his loyal mates lead to the ships, his feeble knees trailing, head swaying from side to side, while he spat from his mouth clotted gore and teeth mingled with the blood. At summons, they receive the helmet and the sword; the palm and the bull they leave to Entellus. At this the victor, triumphant in spirit and glorying in the bull, cries: “O Goddess-born and you Trojans, learn what strength I had in my youthful frame, and from what a death you recall and

Outstretched and lifeless, the bull falls quivering on the ground. Above it he pours forth from his breast these words: “This better life I offer you, Eryx, instead of the death of Dares; here victorious I lay down the gauntlet and my art!”

	Straightway Aeneas invites all, who may so wish, to contend with swift arrows, and proclaims the prizes. With his mighty hand he raises the mast from Serestus’ ship, and from the high pole, on a cord passed round her, suspends a fluttering dove as mark for their shafts. The rivals gather, and a brazen helmet received the lots thrown in. First before all, amid warm cheers, comes forth the turn of Hippocoon, son of Hyrtacus; on him follows Mnestheus, but now victor in the ship race—Mnestheus, wreathed in green olive. Third is Eurytion, your brother, famous Pandarus who of old, when bidden to confound the treaty, first hurled a shaft amid the Achaeans. Last, and in the helmet’s depths, lay Acestes himself, daring to lay hand to the task of youth.

	Then with might and main they bend their bows into a curve, each for himself, and draw shafts from quivers. And first through the sky, from the twanging string, the dart of the son of Hyrtacus cleft the fleet breezes, reached its mark, and struck full in the wood of the mast. The mast quivered, the bird fluttered her wings in terror, and the whole place rang with loud applause. Next valiant

	Mnestheus took his stand with bow bent, aiming aloft, and eyes and shaft levelled alike; yet could not, alas! hit the bird herself with the bolt, but severed the knots and hemp bands tying her foot, as from the high mast she hung: off to the south winds and black clouds she sped in flight. Then quickly Eurytion, who had long held his bow ready and dart drawn, called upon his brother to hear his vow, marked the dove, now exulting in the free sky, and pierced her as she flapped her wings under a dark cloud. Down she fell dead, left her life amid the stars of heaven, and, falling, brought down the arrow that pierced her. Acestes alone was left, the prize now lost; yet upward into the air he aimed his bolt, displaying his veteran skill and the twanging of his bow. On this a sudden portent meets their eyes, destined to prove of mighty consequence, as momentous events revealed later, when in after years fear-inspiring seers declared its import.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] For, flying amid the misty clouds, the reed caught fire, marked its path with flames, then vanished away into thin air—as often shooting stars, unfastened from the firmament, speed across the sky, their tresses streaming in their wake. In amazement the Trinacrians and Trojans stood rooted, praying to the powers above. Nor did great Aeneas reject the omen, but, embracing glad Acestes, loaded him with noble gifts, and spoke thus: “Take them, father, for the great king of Olympus has willed by these auspices that you are to receive honours, though not sharing in the lot. You shall have this

Next for the reward comes he who cut the cord; last is he whose winged shaft had lodged in the mast.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But father Aeneas, before the match was over, calls to him Epytides, guardian and companion of young Iulus, and thus speaks into his faithful ear: “Go now,” he cries, “and tell Ascanius, if he has his company of boys ready, and has marshalled his cavalcade, to lead forth his troops in his grandsire’s honour and show himself in arms.” He himself bids all the streaming throng quit the long course and leave the field clear. On come the boys, and in even array glitter before their fathers’ eyes on bridled steeds; as they pass by, the men of Trinacria and Troy murmur in admiration. All have their hair duly crowned with a trimmed garland; each carries two cornel spearshafts tipped with iron; some have polished quivers on their shoulders; high on the breast around the neck passes a pliant circlet of twisted gold. Three in number are the troops of horses and three the captains that ride to and fro; each is followed by twice six boys, glittering in tripartite array under their respective trainers.

Him a Thracian horse bears, dappled with spots of white, showing white pasterns as it steps and a white, high-towering brow. The second is Atys, from whom the Latin Atii have drawn their line—little Atys, the boyish love of the boy Iulus. Last, and in beauty excelling all, Iulus rode on a Sidonian horse, that fairest Dido had given in remembrance of herself and as a pledge of her love. The rest of the youth ride on the Sicilian steeds of old Acestes . . .

	The Dardans welcome the anxious boys with applause and rejoice, as they gaze, to recognize in them the features of their departed fathers. When they had ridden gaily round the whole concourse before the eyes of their kin, Epytides, as they stood expectant, shouted the signal from afar and cracked his whip. Thereupon they galloped apart in matching order, the three troops breaking their column and dividing into their separate squads; then at the word of command they wheeled about and charged each other with levelled lances.
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] Next they perform other movements and counter movements, confronting one another in the lists; they weave circle with alternate circle, and with real arms awake the mimicry of war. Now they turn their backs in flight, now point their spears aggressively, and now ride side by side in peace. As once in high Crete, it is said, the Labyrinth held a path woven with blind walls, and a be­wildering

Presumably the captains remained in the middle at focal points to effect the regrouping of their troops. Page ([c dimgray]Aeneid I–VI,[/c] p. 428) illustrates the maneuver with a helpful diagram.

The Albans taught their children; from them in turn mighty Rome received the heritage and kept it as an ancestral observance; and today the boys are called Troy and the troop Trojan.

While at the tomb with various games they pay the due rites, Juno, daughter of Saturn, sends Iris down from heaven to the Ilian fleet, and breathes fair winds to waft her on, pondering many a thought and with her ancient grudge still unsated. Iris, speeding her way along her thousand-hued rainbow, runs swiftly down her path, a maiden seen of none. She views the vast throng, scans the shore, and sees the harbour forsaken and the fleet abandoned. But far apart on the lonely shore the Trojan women wept for Anchises’ loss, and all, as they wept, gazed on the fathomless flood. “Ah, for weary folk what waves remain, what

	wastes of sea!” Such is the one cry of all. It is a city they crave; of the sea’s hardships they have had enough. So into their midst, well versed in working ill, Iris flings herself, and lays aside the face and robe of a goddess. She becomes Beroë, aged wife of Tmarian Doryclus, who had once had family, fame, and children, and in this form joins the throng of Dardan mothers. “Ah, wretched we,” she cries, “whom Achaean hands dragged not to death in war beneath our native walls! Ah, hapless race, for what destruction does Fortune reserve you? The seventh summer is now on the wane since Troy’s overthrow and we measure in our course all seas and lands, with many rocks and stars inhospitable, while over the great deep we chase a fleeing Italy and toss upon the waves. Here are the lands of our brother Eryx, and here is our host Acestes. Who forbids us to cast up walls and give our citizens a city? O fatherland, O household gods, in vain rescued from the foe, shall no town hereafter be called Troy’s? Shall I nowhere see a Xanthus and a Simois, the rivers of Hector? Nay, come! and burn with me these accursed ships. For in my sleep the phantom of Cassandra, the soothsayer, seemed to give me blazing brands: ‘Here seek Troy,’ she said; ‘here is your home.’ Now it is time that deeds be done; such portents brook no delay. Lo, four altars to Neptune! The god himself lends the brands and the resolve.”

	Thus speaking, she first fiercely seized the deadly flame, and raising her brand aloft, with full force brandished it and threw. Startled are the minds of the Trojan women, their wits bewildered. At this one from out their throng, and she the eldest, Pyrgo, royal nurse for Priam’s many sons, spoke: “This, look, mothers, is not Beroë; this is

I myself but even now left Beroë behind, sick, and fretting that she alone had no part in such a rite, nor could pay to Anchises the offerings due!” So she spoke . . . But at first the matrons were gazing on the ships doubtfully and with jealous eyes, torn between an unhappy yearning for the land now reached and the destined kingdom that beckons them on, when the goddess on poised wings rose through the sky, cleaving in flight the mighty bow beneath the clouds. Then, indeed, amazed at the marvels and driven by frenzy, they cry aloud, and some snatch fire from the hearths within; others strip the altars, and throw on leaves and twigs and brands. With free rein Vulcan riots amid thwarts and oars and hulls of painted pine.

It is not the foe, not the hostile Argive camp you burn, but your own hopes. I am your own Ascanius!” And before his fleet he flung the empty helmet wherewith he was arrayed as he awoke in sport the mimicry of battle.

	But not for that did the burning flames lay aside their unquelled fury; under the wet oak the tow is alive, slowly belching smoke; the smouldering heat devours the keels, a plague sinking through the whole frame, nor can the heroes’ strength, nor the floods they pour, avail. Then loyal Aeneas rent the garment from his shoulders, and called the gods to his aid, lifting up his hands: “Almighty Jupiter, if you do not yet utterly abhor the Trojans to their last man, if your loving-kindness of old has any regard for human sorrows, grant to the fleet to escape the flame even now, Father, and snatch from doom the slender fortunes of the Trojans! Or if I deserve it, do you with levelled thunderbolt send down to death the little that remains, and here overwhelm us with your hand.” Scarce had he uttered this when with streaming showers a black tempest rages unrestrained; with thunder tremble hills and plains; from the whole sky rushes down a fierce storm of rain, pitch-black with laden south winds. The ships are filled to overflowing, the half-burnt timbers are soaked, till all heat is quenched, and all the hulls save four are rescued from destruction.

	or what the course of fate demanded—he with these words essays to comfort Aeneas: “Let us go, goddess-born, where the Fates, in their ebb and flow, draw us; come what may, endurance must master every fortune. You have Trojan Acestes, of divine stock; take him to share your counsels, a willing partner; to him entrust those who, their ships thus lost, are left over, and those who have grown weary of your great emprise and of your fortunes. Choose out the old men full of years and sea-worn matrons, and all of your company who are weak and fearful of peril, and let the wearied find their city in this land. This city, if you permit the name, they shall call Acesta.”

	Then, indeed, kindled by these words of his aged friend, he is torn asunder in soul amid all his cares. And now, borne upwards in her chariot, black Night held the sky, when there seemed to glide down from heaven the likeness of his father Anchises and suddenly to utter thus his words: “Son, dearer to me than life, in days when life was mine; son, tested by Ilium’s fate! I come hither by Jove’s command, who drove the fire from your fleet, and at last has had pity from high heaven. Obey the fair advice that aged Nautes now gives; chosen youths, the bravest hearts, lead to Italy. A people hard and rugged in nurture must you subdue in Latium. Yet first approach the nether halls of Dis, and through the depths of Avernus seek, my son, a meeting with me. For impious Tartarus, with its gloomy shades, holds me not, but I dwell in Elysium amid the sweet assemblies of the blest. Hither, with much blood of black sheep, the pure Sibyl will lead you; and then you will learn of all your race, and what city is given to you. And

	now farewell; dewy Night wheels her midway course, and the cruel East has breathed on me with panting steeds.” He spoke, and passed like smoke into thin air. “Where are you rushing now?” cries Aeneas. “Where are you hurrying? Whom do you flee, or who bars you from our embraces?” So speaking, he rouses the embers of the slumbering fires, and with holy meal and full censer humbly worships the Lar of Troy and the shrine of hoary Vesta.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Straightway he summons his comrades—Acestes first—and instructs them of Jove’s command, the counsel of his dear father, and the resolve now settled in his soul. Not long is their debate; nor does Acestes refuse his bidding. They enrol the matrons for the town, and set on shore the folk who wish it so—souls with no craving for high renown. They themselves renew the thwarts, and replace the fire-charred timbers of the ships, and fit up oars and rigging—scant of number, but a brave band alive for war. Meanwhile Aeneas marks out the city with a plough and allots homes; this he bids be Ilium and these lands Troy. Trojan Acestes delights in his kingdom, proclaims a court, and gives laws to the assembled senate. Then, on the crest of Eryx, a shrine, nigh to the stars, is founded to Venus of Idalia, and to Anchises’ tomb is assigned a priest with breadth of hallowed grove.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And now for nine days all the folk have feasted and offerings been paid at the altars; gentle winds have lulled the seas, and the South, breathing often upon them, calls them again to sea. Along the winding shore arises a mighty wail; embracing one another, they linger a night and a day.

	Now the very mothers, the very men to whom once the face of the sea seemed cruel and its power intolerable, are ready to go out and bear all toil of exile. These good Aeneas comforts with kindly words, and commends with tears to his kinsman Acestes. Then he bids slay three steers to Eryx and a lamb to the Tempests, and duly loose the moorings. He himself, with temples bound in leaves of trimmed olive, standing apart on the prow, holds the cup, flings the entrails into the salt flood, and pours the liquid wine. A wind, rising astern, attends them on their way. [c dimgray]With rival strokes his comrades lash the sea and sweep the waters.[/c]

	But Venus meanwhile, distressed with cares, speaks thus to Neptune, and from her heart pours out her plaint: “Juno’s fell wrath and implacable heart constrain me, O Neptune, to stoop to every prayer. Her no lapse of time, nor any goodness softens, nor does she rest, still unbent by Fate and Jove’s command. It is not enough that from the midst of the Phrygian race in her fell hate she has devoured their city and dragged through utmost vengeance the remnants of Troy; the very ashes and dust of the slaughtered race she still pursues. The causes of such madness be it hers to know. You are yourself my witness what sudden turmoil she raised of late in the Libyan waters; all the seas she mingled with the sky, in vain relying on the storms of Aeolus; and this she dared in your realm … And, wickedly driving on the Trojan matrons, she has foully burnt their ships, and forced them—their fleet lost—to abandon their comrades to an unknown shore.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then Saturn’s son, lord of the deep sea, spoke thus: “You have every right, Cytherean, to put trust in this, my realm, from which you are born. This, too, I have earned; often have I checked the fury and mighty rage of sea and sky. Nor less on land—I call Xanthus and Simois to witness—has my care been for Aeneas. When Achilles in his pursuit hurled the Trojan bands in panic on their walls, and sent many thousands to death, when the choked rivers groaned, and Xanthus could not find his way or roll out to sea—then it was I who, in a hollow cloud, caught Aeneas, as he confronted the brave son of Peleus and neither the gods nor his strength were in his favour, even though I was eager to uproot from their base the walls of perjured Troy that my own hands had built. Now, too, my purpose stands the same; dispel your fears. In safety, as you pray, shall he reach the haven of Avernus. One only shall there be whom, lost in the flood, you will seek in vain; one life shall be given for many . . .”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When with these words he had soothed to gladness the goddess’s heart, the Sire yokes his wild steeds with gold, fastens their foaming bits, and lets all the reins stream freely in his hand; then over the water’s surface lightly he flies in azure car. The waves sink to rest, beneath the thundering axle the sea of swollen waters is smoothed, and the storm clouds vanish from the wide sky. Then come the diverse forms of his train—monstrous whales, the aged company of Glaucus, with Ino’s son, Palaemon, the swift Tritons, and the whole host of Phorcus. Thetis and Melite

	At this, soothing joys in their turn thrill father Aeneas’ anxious heart. He bids all the masts be raised with speed and the yards spread with sails. Together all set the sheets, and all at once, now to the left and now to the right, they let out the canvas; together they turn to and fro the yardarms aloft; favouring breezes bear on the fleet. First before all, leading the close column, was Palinurus; by him the rest are bidden to shape their course. And now dewy Night had just reached its mid-goal in heaven; the sailors, stretched on their hard benches under the oars, relaxed their limbs in quiet rest; when Sleep, sliding lightly down from the stars of heaven, parted the dusky air and cleft the gloom, seeking you, Palinurus, and bringing you baleful dreams, guiltless one! There on the high stern sat the god, in semblance of Phorbas, and pours these accents from his lips: “Palinurus, son of Iasus, the seas of themselves bear on the fleet; the breezes breathe steadily; the hour is given to rest. Lay down your head and steal your weary eyes from toil. I myself for a space will take your duty in your stead.” To him, scarce lifting his eyes, speaks Palinurus: “Me do you bid shut my eyes to the sea’s calm face and peaceful waves? Me put faith in this monster? And Aeneas—why, indeed, am I to trust him to the treacherous breezes, I whom a clear sky has so often deceived?” Such words he said and, clinging fast to the tiller, never let loose his hold, and kept his eyes upturned to the stars.

Hardly had a sudden slumber begun to unbend his limbs when, leaning above, Sleep flung him headlong into the clear waters, tearing away, as he fell, the helm and part of the stern, and calling vainly on his comrades again and again. The god himself winged his way in flight to the thin air above. None the less the fleet speeds safely on its course over the sea and, trusting in Father Neptune’s promises, glides on unafraid. And now, onward borne, it was nearing the cliffs of the Sirens, perilous of old and white with the bones of many men—at this time with the ceaseless surf the rocks afar were booming hoarsely—when the sire found that his ship was drifting aimlessly, her pilot lost, and himself steered her amid the waves of night, often sighing and stunned at heart by his friend’s mischance. “Ah, too trustful in the calm of sky and sea, naked you will lie, Palinurus, on an unknown strand!”

	Thus he cries weeping, and gives his fleet the reins, and at last glides up to the shores of Euboean Cumae. They turn the prows seaward, then with the grip of anchors’ teeth made fast the ships, and the round keels fringe the beach. In hot haste the youthful band leaps forth on the Hesperian shore; some seek the seeds of flame hidden in veins of flint, some despoil the woods, the thick coverts of game, and point to new-found streams. But loyal Aeneas seeks the heights, where Apollo sits enthroned,
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and a vast cavern hard by, hidden haunt of the dread Sibyl, into whom the Delian seer breathes a mighty mind and soul, revealing the future. Now they pass under the grove of Trivia and the roof of gold.

	Daedalus, it is said, when fleeing from Minos’ realm, dared on swift wings to trust himself to the sky; on his unwonted way he floated forth towards the cold North, and at last stood lightly poised above the Chalcidian hill. Here first restored to earth, he dedicated to thee, Phoebus, the oarage of his wings and built a vast temple. On the doors is the death of Androgeos; then the children of Cecrops, bidden, alas, to pay as yearly tribute seven living sons; there

Opposite, rising from the sea, the Cretan land faces this; here is the cruel love of the bull, Pasiphaë craftily mated, and the mongrel breed of the Minotaur, a hybrid offspring, record of monstrous love; there that house of toil, a maze inextricable; but Daedalus, pitying the princess’s great love, himself unwound the deceptive tangle of the palace, guiding blind feet with the thread. You, too, Icarus, would have large share in such a work, did grief permit: twice had he essayed to fashion your fall in gold; twice sank the father’s hands. Ay, and all the tale throughout would their eyes have scanned, but now came Achates from his errand, and with him the priestess of Phoebus and Trivia, Deiphobe, daughter of Glaucus, who thus addresses the king: “Not sights like these does this hour demand! Now it were better to sacrifice seven bullocks from the unbroken herd, and as many ewes fitly chosen.” Having thus addressed Aeneas—and not slow are the men to do her sacred bidding—the priestess calls the Teucrians into the lofty fane.

For till then the mighty mouths of the awestruck house will not gape open.” So she spoke and was mute. A chill shudder ran through the Teucrians’ sturdy frames, and their king pours forth prayers from his inmost heart: “Phoebus, who never failed to pity Troy’s sore agony, who guided the Dardan shaft and hand of Paris against the body of Aeacus’ son, under your guidance did I enter so many seas, skirting mighty lands, the far remote Massylian tribes, and fields the Syrtes fringe; now at last is Italy’s ever receding shore within our grasp; thus far only may Troy’s fortune have followed us! You, too, may now fitly spare the race of Pergamus, you gods and goddesses all, to whom Troy and Dardania’s great glory were an offence. And you, most holy prophetess, who foreknow the future, grant—I ask no realm unpledged by my fate—that the Teucrians may rest in Latium, with the wandering gods and storm-tossed powers of Troy. Then to Phoebus and Trivia will I set up a temple of solid marble, and festal days in Phoebus’ name.

	But the prophetess, not yet brooking the sway of Phoebus, storms wildly in the cavern, if so she may shake the mighty god from her breast; so much the more he tires her raving mouth, tames her wild heart, and moulds her by constraint. And now the hundred mighty mouths of the house have opened of their own will, and bring through the air the seer’s reply: “O you that have at length survived the great perils of the sea—yet by land more grievous woes lie in wait—into the realm of Lavinium the sons of Dardanus shall come, relieve your heart of this care. Yet they shall not also rejoice in their coming. Wars, grim wars I see, and the Tiber foaming with streams of blood. You will not lack a Simois, nor a Xanthus,
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] nor a Doric camp. Even now in Latium a new Achilles has been born, himself a goddess’s son;
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] nor shall Juno anywhere fail to dog the Trojans, while you, a suppliant in your need, what races, what cities of Italy will you not implore! The cause of all this Trojan woe is again an alien bride, again a foreign marriage!

	Aeneas the hero begins: “For me no form of toils arises, O maiden, strange or unlooked for; all this have I foreseen and debated in my mind. One thing I pray: since here is the famed gate of the nether king, and the gloomy marsh from Acheron’s overflow, be it granted me to pass into my dear father’s sight and presence; show the way and open the hallowed portals! Amid flames and a thousand pursuing spears, I rescued him on these shoulders, and brought him safe from the enemy’s midst. He, the partner of my journey, endured with me all the seas and all the menace of ocean and sky, weak as he was, beyond the strength and portion of age. He it was who prayed and charged me humbly to seek you and draw near to your threshold. Pity both son and sire, I beseech you, gracious one; for you are all-powerful, and not in vain did Hecate make you mistress in the groves of Avernus. If Orpheus availed to summon his wife’s shade, strong in his Thracian lyre and tuneful strings; if Pollux, dying in turn, ransomed his brother and so many times comes and goes his way—why speak of Theseus, why of Hercules the mighty—I, too, have descent from Jove most high!”

But if such love is in your heart—if such a yearning, twice to swim the Stygian lake, twice to see black Tartarus—and if you are pleased to give rein to the mad endeavour, hear what must first be done. There lurks in a shady tree a bough, golden in leaf and pliant stem, held consecrate to nether Juno;
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] this all the grove hides, and shadows veil in the dim valleys. But it is not given to pass beneath earth’s hidden places, before someone has plucked from the tree the golden-tressed fruitage. This has beautiful Proserpine ordained to be borne to her as her own gift. When the first is torn away, a second fails not, golden too, and the spray bears leaf of the selfsame ore. Search then with eyes aloft and, when found, duly pluck it with your hand; for of itself will it follow you, freely and with ease, if Fate be calling you; else with no force will you avail to win it or rend it with hard steel. Moreover, there lies the dead body of your friend—ah, you know it not!—and defiles all the fleet with death, while you seek counsel and hover on our threshold. Bear him first to his own place and hide him in the tomb. Lead black cattle; be these your first peace offerings. Only so will you survey the Stygian groves and realms the living may not tread.” She spoke, and with closed lips was silent.

	comrade spoke the soothsayer, of what body for burial? And as they came, they see on the dry beach Misenus, cut off by untimely death—Misenus, son of Aeolus, surpassed by none in stirring men with his bugle’s blare, and in kindling with his clang the god of war. He had been great Hector’s comrade, at Hector’s side he braved the fray, glorious for clarion and spear alike; but when Achilles, victorious, stripped his chief of life, the valiant hero came into the fellowship of Dardan Aeneas, following no meaner standard. Yet on that day, while by chance he made the seas ring with his hollow shell—madman—and with his blare calls the gods to contest, jealous Triton, if the tale can win belief, caught and plunged him in the foaming waves amid the rocks. So, with loud lament, all were mourning round him, good Aeneas foremost. Then, weeping, they quickly carry out the Sibyl’s commands, and toil to pile up trees for the altar of his tomb and rear it to the sky. They pass into the forest primeval, the deep lairs of beasts; down drop the pitchy pines, and the ilex rings to the stroke of the axe; ashen logs and splintering oak are cleft with wedges, and from the mountains they roll down huge ash trees.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	No less Aeneas, first amid such toils, cheers his comrades and girds on like weapons. And alone he ponders with his own sad heart, gazing on the boundless forest, and, as it chanced, thus prays: “O if now that golden bough would show itself to us on the tree in the deep wood! For all things truly—ah, too truly—did the seer say of you, Misenus.” Scarce had he said these words when under his very eyes twin doves, as it chanced, came flying from the

Then the great hero knew them for his mother’s birds, and prays with joy: “Be my guides, if any way there be, and through the air steer a course into the grove, where the rich bough overshades the fruitful ground! And you, goddess-mother, fail not my dark hour!” So speaking, he checked his steps, marking what signs they bring, where they direct their course. As they fed, they advanced in flight just so far as a pursuer’s eyes could keep them within sight; then, when they came to the jaws of noisome Avernus, they swiftly rise and, dropping through the unclouded air, perch side by side on their chosen goal—a tree, through whose branches flashed the contrasting glimmer of gold. As in winter’s cold, amid the woods, the mistletoe, sown of an alien tree, is wont to bloom with strange leafage, and with yellow fruit embrace the shapely stems: such was the vision of the leafy gold on the shadowy ilex, so rustled the foil in the gentle breeze. Forthwith Aeneas plucks it and greedily breaks off the clinging bough, and carries it beneath the roof of the prophetic Sibyl.

	No less meanwhile on the beach the Teucrians were weeping for Misenus and paying the last dues to the thankless dust. And first they raise a huge pyre, rich with pitchy pine and oaken logs. Its sides they entwine with somber foliage, set in front funereal cypresses, and adorn it above with gleaming arms. Some heat water, setting cauldrons bubbling on the flames, and wash and anoint the cold body. Loud is the wailing; then, their weeping done, they lay his limbs upon the couch, and over them cast purple robes,

The gifts are piled up in the blaze—frankincense, viands, and bowls of flowing oil. After the ashes fell in and the flame died away, they washed with wine the remnant of thirsty dust, and Corynaeus, gathering the bones, hid them in a brazen urn. He, too, with pure water thrice encircled his comrades and cleansed them, sprinkling light dew from a fruitful olive bough, and spoke the words of farewell. But loyal Aeneas heaps over him a massive tomb, with the soldier’s own arms, his oar and trumpet, beneath a lofty hill, which now from him is called Misenus, and keeps from age to age an ever living name.

Hither rushed all the throng, streaming to the banks; mothers and men and bodies of high-souled heroes, their life now done, boys and unwedded girls, and sons placed on the pyre before their fathers’ eyes; thick as the leaves of the forest that at autumn’s first frost drop and fall, and thick as the birds that from the seething deep flock shoreward, when the chill of the year drives them overseas and sends them into sunny lands.

But the surly boatman takes now these, now those, while others he thrusts away, back from the brink.

All this crowd that you see is helpless and graveless; yonder ferryman is Charon; those whom the flood carries are the buried. He may not carry them over the dreadful banks and hoarse-voiced waters until their bones have found a resting place. A hundred years they roam and flit about these shores; then only are they admitted and revisit the longed-for pools.” Anchises’ son paused and stayed his steps, pondering much, and pitying in his heart their unjust lot.

Him, when at last amid the deep gloom he knew the sorrowful form, he first accosts thus: “What god, Palinurus, tore you from us and plunged you beneath the open ocean? O tell me! For Apollo, never before found false, with this one answer tricked my soul, for he foretold that you would escape the sea and reach Ausonian shores. Is this how he keeps his promise?” But he answered: “Neither did tripod of Phoebus fail you, my captain, Anchises’ son, nor did a god plunge me in the deep. For by chance the helm to which I clung, steering our course, was violently torn from me, and as I fell headlong, I dragged it down with me. By the rough seas I swear that not for myself did I feel such fear as for your ship, lest, stripped of its gear and deprived of its helmsman, it might fail amid such surging waves. Three stormy nights over the measureless seas the South Wind drove me wildly on the water; scarce on the fourth dawn, aloft on the crest of a wave, I sighted Italy. Little by little I swam shoreward, and even now was grasping at safety, but as, weighted by dripping garb, I caught with bent fingers at the rugged cliff-spurs, the barbarous folk assailed me with the sword, in ignorance deeming me a prize. Now the wave holds me, and the winds toss me on the beach. Oh, by heaven’s sweet light and air, I beseech you, by your father,

	by the rising hope of Iulus, snatch me from these woes, un-conquered one! Either cast earth on me,
	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] for that you can, by seeking again the haven of Velia; or if there be a way, if your goddess-mother shows you one—for not without divine favour, I believe, are you trying to sail these great streams and the Stygian mere—give your hand to one so unhappy, and take me with you across the waves, that at least in death I may find a quiet resting place!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So had he spoken, and the soothsayer thus began: “Whence, Palinurus, comes this wild longing of yours? Are you, unburied, to look upon the Stygian waters and the Furies’ stern river,
	[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c] and unbidden draw near the bank? Cease to dream that heaven’s decrees may be turned aside by prayer. But hear and remember my words, to solace your hard lot; for the neighbouring people, in their cities far and wide, shall be driven by celestial portents to appease your dust, and shall build a tomb, and to the tomb pay solemn offerings; and for ever the place shall bear the name of Palinurus.”
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] By these words his cares are dispelled and for a little space grief is driven from his anguished heart; the land rejoices in the name.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So they pursue the journey begun, and draw near to the river. But when, even from the Stygian wave, the boatman saw them passing through the silent wood and turning their feet towards the bank, he first, unhailed, accosts and rebukes them: “Whoever you are who come to our river in arms, tell me, even from there, why you come, and check your step. This is the land of Shadows, of Sleep and drowsy

	Night; living bodies I may not carry in the Stygian boat. And in truth it brought me no joy that I took Heracles on his journey over the lake, or Theseus and Pirithoüs, though sons of gods and invincible in valour. The one by force sought to drag into chains, even from the monarch’s throne, the warder of Tartarus, and tore him off trembling; these essayed to carry off our queen from the chamber of Dis.” In answer the Amphrysian
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c] soothsayer spoke briefly: “No such trickery is here; be not troubled; our weapons offer no force; the huge doorkeeper may from his cave with endless howl affright the bloodless shades; Proserpine may in purity keep within her uncle’s threshold. Trojan Aeneas, famous for piety and arms, descends to his father, to the lowest shades of Erebus. If the picture of such piety in no wise moves you, yet know this bough”—and she shows the bough, hidden in her robe. At this his swelling breast subsides from its anger. No more is said; but he, marvelling at the dread gift, the fateful wand so long unseen, turns his blue barge and nears the shore. Then other souls that sat on the long thwarts he routs out, and clears the gangways; at once he takes aboard giant Aeneas. The seamy craft groaned under the weight, and through its chinks took in a marshy flood. At last, across the water, he lands seer and soldier unharmed on the ugly mire and grey sedge.

	At once are heard voices and wailing sore—the souls of infants weeping, whom, on the very threshold of the sweet life they shared not, torn from the breast, the black day swept off and plunged in bitter death.
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] Near them were those on false charge condemned to die. Yet not without lot, not without a judge, are these places given: Minos, presiding, shakes the urn; he it is who calls a conclave of the silent, and learns men’s lives and misdeeds. The region thereafter is held by those sad souls who in innocence wrought their own death and, loathing the light, flung away their lives. How gladly now, in the air above, would they bear both want and harsh distress! Fate withstands; the unlovely mere with its dreary water enchains them and Styx imprisons with his ninefold circles.

	Not far from here, outspread on every side, are shown the Mourning Fields; such is the name they bear. Here those whom stern Love has consumed with cruel wasting are hidden in walks withdrawn, embowered in a myrtle grove; even in death the pangs leave them not. In this region he sees Phaedra and Procris, and sad Eriphyle, pointing to the wounds her cruel son had dealt, and Evadne and Pasiphaë.

	her form of old. Among them, with wound still fresh, Phoenician Dido was wandering in the great forest, and soon as the Trojan hero stood near and knew her, a dim form amid the shadows—even as, in the early month, one sees or fancies he has seen the moon rise amid the clouds—he shed tears, and spoke to her in tender love: “Unhappy Dido! Was the tale true then that came to me, that you were dead and had sought your doom with the sword? Was I, alas! the cause of your death? By the stars I swear, by the world above, and whatever is sacred in the grave below, unwillingly, queen, I parted from your shores. But the gods’ decrees, which now constrain me to pass through these shades, through lands squalid and forsaken, and through abysmal night, drove me with their behests; nor could I deem my going thence would bring on you distress so deep. Stay your step and withdraw not from our view. Whom do you flee? This is the last word Fate suffers me to say to you.” With these words amid springing tears Aeneas strove to soothe the wrath of the fiery, fierce-eyed queen. She, turning away, kept her looks fixed on the ground and no more changes her countenance as he essays to speak than if she were set in hard flint or Marpesian rock. At length she flung herself away and, still his foe, fled back to the shady grove, where Sychaeus, her lord of former days, responds to her sorrows and gives her love for love. Yet none the less, stricken by her unjust doom, Aeneas attends her with tears afar and pities her as she goes.

Round about, on right and left, stand the souls in throngs. To have seen him once is not enough; they delight to linger, to pace beside him, and to learn the causes of his coming.

When the fateful horse leapt over the heights of Troy, and brought armed infantry to weight its womb, she feigned a solemn dance and round the city led the Phrygian wives, shrieking in their Bacchic rites; she herself in the midst held a mighty torch and called the Danaans from the castle-height. Care-worn and sunk in slumber, I was then inside our ill-starred bridal chamber, sleep weighing upon me as I lay—sweet and deep, very image of death’s peace. Meanwhile, this peerless wife takes every weapon from the house—even from under my head she had withdrawn my trusty sword; into the house she calls Menelaus and flings wide the door, hoping, I doubt not, that her lover would find this a great boon, and so the fame of old misdeeds might be blotted out. Why prolong the story? They burst into my chamber; with them comes their fellow counsellor of sin, the son of Aeolus.
	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c] O gods, with like penalties repay the Greeks, if with pious lips I pray for vengeance! But come, tell in turn what chance has brought you here, alive. Have you come here driven by your ocean-wanderings, or at Heaven’s command? Or what doom compels you to visit these sad, sunless dwellings, this land of disorder?”

	During this interchange of talk, Dawn, with roseate car, had now crossed mid-heaven in her skyey course, and perchance in such wise they would have spent all the allotted time, but the Sibyl beside him gave warning with brief words: “Night is coming, Aeneas; we waste the hours in weeping. Here is the place, where the road parts:
	[c dimgray][sup]26[/sup][/c] there to the right, as it runs under the walls of great Dis, is our way to Elysium, but the left wreaks the punishment of the wicked, and sends them on to pitiless Tartarus.” In reply Deiphobus said: “Be not angry, great priestess; I will go my way; I will make the count complete and return to the darkness. Go, you who are our glory, go; enjoy a happier fate!” Thus much he said and, as he spoke, turned his steps.

	Suddenly Aeneas looks back, and under a cliff on the left sees a broad castle, girt with triple wall and encircled with a rushing flood of torrent flames—Tartarean Phlegethon, that rolls along thundering rocks. In front stands a huge gate, and pillars of solid adamant, that no might of man, nay, not even the sons of heaven, could uproot in war; there stands an iron tower, soaring high, and Tisiphone, sitting girt with bloody pall, keeps sleepless watch over the portal night and day. From it are heard groans, the sound of the savage lash, the clank of iron and the dragging of chains. Aeneas stopped, and terrified drank in the tumult. “What forms of crime are these? Say, O maiden! With what penalties are they scourged? What is this vast wailing on the wind?” Then the seer thus began to speak: “Famed chieftain of the Teucrians, no pure soul may tread the accursed

Cretan Rhadamanthus holds here his iron sway; he chastises, and hears the tale of guilt, exacting confession of crimes, whenever in the world above any man, rejoicing in vain deceit, has put off atonement for sin until death’s late hour. Straightway avenging Tisiphone, girt with the lash, leaps on the guilty to scourge them, and with left hand brandishing her grim snakes, calls on her savage sister band. Then at last, grating on harsh, jarring hinge, the infernal gates open. Do you see what sentry
	[c dimgray][sup]27[/sup][/c] sits in the doorway? what shape guards the threshold? The monstrous Hydra, still fiercer, with her fifty black gaping throats, dwells within. Then Tartarus itself yawns sheer down, stretching into the gloom twice as far as is the upward view of the sky toward heavenly Olympus. Here the ancient sons of Earth, the Titan’s brood, hurled down by the thunderbolt, writhe in the lowest abyss. Here, too, I saw the twin sons of Aloeus, giant in stature, whose hands tried to tear down high Heaven and thrust down Jove from his realm above. Salmoneus, too, I saw, who paid a cruel penalty while aping Jove’s fires and the thunders of Olympus. Borne by four horses and brandishing a torch, he rode triumphant through the Greek peoples and his city in the heart of Elis, claiming as his own the homage of deity. Madman, to mimic the storm clouds and inimitable thunder with brass and the tramp of horn-footed horses! But the Father Almighty amid thick clouds launched his bolt—no firebrands he, nor pitch-pines’ smoky glare—and drove

All dared a monstrous sin, and what they dared attained. Nay, had I a hundred tongues, a hundred mouths, and voice of iron, I could not sum up all the forms of crime, or rehearse all the tale of torments.”

	So spoke the aged priestess of Phoebus; then adds: “But come now, hasten your step and fulfil the task in hand. Let us hasten. I descry the ramparts reared by Cyclopean forges and the gates with fronting arch, where they bid us lay the appointed gifts.” She ended, and, advancing side by side along the dusky way, they haste over the mid-space and draw near the doors.

These, as they streamed round, the Sibyl thus addressed, Musaeus before all; for he is centre of that vast throng that gazes up to him, as with shoulders high he towers aloft: “Say, happy souls, and you, best of bards, what land, what place holds Anchises? For his sake are we come, and have sailed across the great rivers of Erebus.” And to her the hero thus made brief reply: “None has a fixed home. We dwell in shady groves, and live on cushioned riverbanks and in meadows fresh with streams. But if the wish in your heart so inclines, surmount this ridge, and soon I will set you on an easy path.” He spoke and stepped on before, and from above points out the shining fields. Then they leave

	But deep in a green vale father Anchises was surveying with earnest thought the imprisoned souls that were to pass to the light above and, as it chanced, was counting over the full number of his people and beloved children, their fates and fortunes, their works and ways. And as he saw Aeneas coming towards him over the sward, he eagerly stretched forth both hands, while tears streamed from his eyes and a cry fell from his lips: “Have you come at last, and has the duty that your father expected vanquished the toilsome way? Is it given me to see your face, my son, and hear and utter familiar tones? Even so I mused and deemed the hour would come, counting the days, nor has my yearning failed me. Over what lands, what wide seas have you journeyed to my welcome! What dangers have beset you, my son! How I feared the realm of Libya might work you harm!” But he answered: “Your shade, father, your sad shade, meeting me repeatedly, drove me to seek these portals. My ships ride the Tuscan sea. Grant me to clasp your hand, grant me, father, and withdraw not from my embrace!” So he spoke, his face wet with flooding tears. Thrice there he strove to throw his arms about his neck; thrice the form, vainly clasped, fled from his hands, even as light winds, and most like a
	Meanwhile, in a retired vale, Aeneas sees a sequestered grove and rustling forest thickets, and the river of Lethe drifting past those peaceful homes. About it hovered peoples and tribes unnumbered; even as when, in the meadows, in cloudless summertime, bees light on many-hued

	blossoms and stream round lustrous lilies and all the fields murmur with the humming. Aeneas is startled by the sudden sight and, knowing not, asks the cause—what is that river yonder, and who are the men thronging the banks in such a host? Then said father Anchises: “Spirits they are, to whom second bodies are owed by Fate, and at the water of Lethe’s stream they drink the soothing draught and long forgetfulness. These in truth I have long yearned to tell and show you to your face, yea, to count this, my children’s seed, that so you may rejoice with me the more at finding Italy.” “But, father, must we think that any souls pass aloft from here to the world above and return a second time to bodily fetters? What mad longing for life possesses their sorry hearts?” “I will surely tell you, my son, and keep you not in doubt,” Anchises replies, and reveals each truth in order.

	“First, know that heaven and earth and the watery plains, the moon’s bright sphere and Titan’s star,
	[c dimgray][sup]33[/sup][/c] a spirit within sustains; in all the limbs mind moves the mass and mingles with the mighty frame. Thence
	[c dimgray][sup]34[/sup][/c] spring the races of man and beast, the life of winged creatures, and the monsters that ocean bears beneath his marble surface. Fiery is the vigour and divine the source of those seeds of life, so far as harmful bodies clog them not, or earthly limbs and frames born but to die. Hence their fears and desires, their griefs and joys; nor do they discern the heavenly light, penned as they are in the gloom of their dark dungeon.

	Still more! When life’s last ray has fled, the wretches are not entirely freed from all evil and all the plagues of the body; and it needs must be that many a taint, long ingrained, should in wondrous wise become deeply rooted in their being. Therefore are they schooled with punishments, and pay penance for bygone sins. Some are hung stretched out to the empty winds; from others the stain of guilt is washed away under swirling floods or burned out by fire till length of days, when time’s cycle is complete, has removed the inbred taint and leaves unsoiled the ethereal sense and pure flame of spirit: each of us undergoes his own purgatory. Then we are sent to spacious Elysium, a few of us to possess the blissful fields. All these that you see, when they have rolled time’s wheel through a thousand years, the god summons in vast throng to Lethe’s river, so that, their memories effaced, they may once more revisit the vault above and conceive the desire of return to the body.”

	Anchises paused, and drew his son and with him the Sibyl into the heart of the assembly and buzzing throng, then chose a mound whence he might scan face to face the whole of the long procession and note their faces as they came.

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c]On death human beings undergo a long period of purgatorial chastisement (of a kind appropriate to the individual) until the soul is completely purified; they then attain the bliss of Elysium (the elect, for ever); the majority, after a thousand years, drink of the water of oblivion so that they may be born in new bodies without memory of their former existence. The passage is quite clear but since editors and commentators fail to realize the dislocation of 743f (for which Varius may be responsible), they are faced with an impossible task in explaining a text in which purgatory comes after entry into paradise.

	[c dimgray][sup]49[/sup][/c] shall uproot Argos, Agamemnon’s Mycenae, and even an heir of Aeacus, seed of mighty Achilles: he will avenge his Trojan sires and Minerva’s polluted shrine. Who, lordly Cato,
	[c dimgray][sup]50[/sup][/c] could leave you unsung, or you, Cossus;
	[c dimgray][sup]51[/sup][/c] who the Gracchan race or the Scipios twain, two thunderbolts of war and the ruin of Carthage, or Fabricius, in penury a prince, or you, Serranus, sowing seed in the soil? Whither, O Fabii, do ye hurry me all breathless? You are he, the mightiest,
	[c dimgray][sup]52[/sup][/c] who could, as no one else, through inaction preserve our state. Others, I doubt not, shall with softer mould beat out the breathing bronze, coax from the marble features to the life, plead cases with greater eloquence and with a pointer trace heaven’s motions and predict the risings of the stars: you, Roman, be sure to rule the world (be these your arts), to crown peace with justice, to spare the vanquished and to crush the proud.”

	At this Aeneas said—for by his side he saw a youth of passing beauty in resplendent arms, but with joyless mien and eyes downcast: “Who, father, is he that thus attends the warrior on his way? Is it his son, or some other of his progeny’s heroic line? What a stir among his entourage! What majesty is his! But death’s dark shadow flickers mournfully about his head.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then, as his tears well up, Father Anchises begins: “My son, seek not to taste the bitter grief of your people; only a glimpse of him will fate give earth nor suffer him to stay long. Too powerful, O gods above, you deemed the Roman people, had these gifts of yours been lasting. What sobbing of the brave will the famed Field

Alas for his goodness, alas for his chivalrous honour and his sword arm unconquerable in the fight!

Grant me to scatter in handfuls lilies of purple blossom, to heap at least these gifts on my descendant’s shade and perform an unavailing duty.” Thus they wander at large over the whole region in the wide airy plain, taking note of all. After Anchises had led his son over every scene, kindling his soul with longing for the glory that was to be, he then tells of the wars that the hero next must wage, the Laurentine peoples and Latinus’ town, and how he is to face or flee each peril.

	[c dimgray][sup]57[/sup][/c] there are, whereof the one, they say, is horn and offers a ready exit to true shades, the other shining with sheen of polished ivory, but delusive dreams issue upward through it from the world below. Thither Anchises, discoursing thus, escorts his son and with him the Sibyl, and sends them forth by the ivory gate: Aeneas speeds his way to the ships and rejoins his comrades; then straight along the shore he sails for Caieta’s haven.

	[b][c dimgray]Footnotes[/c][/b]
	[c dimgray][sup]57[/sup][/c]The gates of Sleep are taken from Homer, [c dimgray]Odyssey[/c] 19, 562–7, where Penelope speaks of her dream of Odysseus’ vengeance as a delusion. By making Aeneas leave by the gate of delusive dreams Virgil represents his vision of Rome’s destiny as a dream which he is not to remember on his return to the real world; the poet will have us know that from the beginning of Book 7 his hero has not been endowed with superhuman knowledge to confront the problems which face him.

	Now good Aeneas, when the last rites were duly paid and the funeral mound was raised, as soon as the high seas were stilled, sails forth on his way and leaves the haven. Breezes blow on into the night, and the Moon, shining bright, smiles on their voyage; the sea glitters beneath her dancing beams. The next shores they skirt are those of Circe’s realm,
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] where the wealthy daughter of the Sun thrills the untrodden groves with ceaseless song and in her proud palace burns fragrant cedar to illuminate the night, while she drives her shrill shuttle through the fine web. From these shores could be heard the angry growls of lions chafing at their bonds and roaring in midnight hours, the raging of bristly boars and caged bears, and huge wolfish shapes howling. These were they whom, robbing them of their human form with potent herbs, Circe, cruel goddess, had clothed in the features and frames of beasts. But so

	Now the sea was reddening with the rays of dawn, and from heaven’s height the goddess of Dawn on her rosy chariot shone in saffron light, when the winds dropped and suddenly every breeze sank; the oars toil slowly against the marble smoothness of the water. At this moment Aeneas, looking from the sea, beholds a mighty forest. Through its midst the Tiber’s lovely stream leaps forth to sea in swirling eddies with his burden of golden sand. Around and above, birds of many a kind that haunt the river’s banks and channel were thrilling heaven with their song and flying in the grove.

	Picus, and he boasts you, Saturn, as his father; you are the first founder of the line. By Heaven’s decree his son, his male descent, was no more, but had been cut off in the spring of early youth. Alone, to preserve the house and noble home, was a daughter, now ripe for a husband, now of full age to be a bride. Many wooed her from wide Latium and all Ausonia, yet handsomest above all other wooers was Turnus, of long and lofty ancestry, whom the queen mother yearned with wondrous passion to unite to her as son. But divine portents, with manifold alarms, bar the way. In the midst of the palace, in the high inner courts, stood a laurel of sacred foliage, preserved in awe through many years, which lord Latinus himself was said to have founded and dedicated to Phoebus, when he built his first towers; and from it he gave his settlers their name Laurentes. In the top of this tree, wondrous to tell, settled a dense swarm of bees, borne with loud humming across the liquid air, and with feet intertwined hung in sudden swarm from the leafy bough. At once the prophet cries: “I see a stranger draw near; from the selfsame quarter a troop seeks the same quarter, and reigns in the topmost citadel!” Moreover, while with hallowed torch he kindles the altars, and at her father’s side stands the maiden Lavinia, she was seen (O horror!) to catch fire in her long tresses, and burn with crackling flame in all her headgear, her queenly hair ablaze, ablaze her jewelled coronal; then wreathed in smoke and yellow glare, she scattered fire throughout the palace. That indeed was noised abroad as an awful and wondrous vision; for she, they foretold, would herself be

	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] the whole world roll obedient beneath their feet.” This answer of his father Faunus, and the warning he gave in the silent night, Latinus keeps not shut within his own lips; but Rumour, flitting far and wide, had already borne the tidings through the Ausonian cities when the sons of Laomedon moored their ships to the river’s grassy bank.

	Aeneas, his chief captains, and fair Iülus lay their limbs to rest under the boughs of a high tree, and spread the feast; they place cakes of meal on the grass beneath the food—Jove himself inspired them—and they crown the wheaten base with fruits of the field. Here, haply, when the rest was consumed, and the scantness of fare drove them to turn their teeth upon the thin cakes—to profane with hand and daring jaw the fateful circles of crust, and spare not the broad loaves:
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] “Oh, look! we are eating our tables too!” said Iülus in jest; and said no more. That cry, when heard, first brought an end of toil; and as it first fell from the speaker’s lips, his father caught it up and checked his utterance, awestruck at Heaven’s will. Straightway, “Hail,” he cries, “land destined as my due! and hail to you, faithful gods of Troy! Here is our home, here our country! For my father Anchises
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c]—now I recall it—bequeathed me this secret of fate: ‘My son, when you are carried to an unknown shore and hunger compels you, as food fails, to eat your tables, then in your weariness hope for a home, and there be mindful first to set up your dwellings with your hand and bank them with a mound.’ This was that hunger foretold, this the last strait awaiting us, that was to set an end to our deadly woes! . . . Come then, and gladly with the sun’s first beams let us explore what lands these are, what people here dwell, where is the city of the nation, and from the harbour let us explore in different directions. Now pour your cups to Jove, and call in prayer on my sire Anchises, and set the wine again upon the board.”

	So speaking, he straightway wreaths his temples with leafy bough and prays to the genius of the place, and Earth, first of gods; to the nymphs and the rivers yet unknown; then to Night and Night’s rising signs, and to Jove of Ida and the Phrygian Mother, each in order, and his two parents, in heaven and in the underworld. At this, the almighty Father thundered thrice from a clear sky, and showed forth from heaven a cloud ablaze with shafts of golden light, brandishing it in his own hand. Then suddenly through the Trojan band runs the rumour that the day has come to found their promised city. Emulously they renew the feast, and cheered by the mighty omen set on the bowls and wreathe the wine.

	On the morrow, when the risen day was lighting the earth with her earliest torch, by separate ways they search out the city
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] and boundaries and coasts of the nation. This, they learn, is the pool of Numicius’ fount; this the Tiber river; here dwell the brave Latins. Then Anchises’ son commands a hundred envoys, chosen from every rank, to go to the king’s stately city, all shadowed by the boughs of Pallas, to bear gifts to the hero, and crave peace for the Trojans. They linger not, but hasten at his bidding and move with rapid steps. Aeneas himself marks out his walls with a shallow trench, toils over the ground, and encircles this first settlement on the coast, after the fashion of a camp, with mound and battlements. And now his men had traversed their way; they were in sight of the towers and steeproofs of Latinus, and drew near to the wall. Outside the city, boys and youths in their early bloom practise horsemanship, or break in teams amid the dust, or bend

	Stately and vast, towering with a hundred columns, his house crowned the city, once the palace of Laurentian Picus, awe-inspiring with its grove and the reverence of generations. Here it was auspicious for kings to receive the sceptre, and first uplift the fasces; this shrine was their senate house, this the scene of their holy feasts; here, after slaughter of rams, the elders were wont to sit down at the long line of tables. There, too, in order are images of their forefathers of long ago, carved of old cedar—Italus and father Sabinus, planter of the vine, guarding in his image the curved pruning hook, and aged Saturn, and the likeness of two-faced Janus—all standing in the vestibule; and other kings from the beginning, and men who had suffered wounds of war, fighting for their fatherland. Many arms, moreover, hang on the sacred doors, captive chariots, curved axes, helmet crests and massive bars of city gates; javelins and shields and beaks wrenched from ships. There sat one, holding the Quirinal staff

	Such was the temple of the gods in which Latinus, seated on the throne of his fathers, summoned the Teucrians to his presence in the halls, and as they entered greeted them thus with gentle countenance: “Tell, sons of Dardanus—for your city and race we know, and not unheard of is your journey over the deep—what do you seek? What cause, or what need, has borne you to the Ausonian shore over so many dark-blue waters? Whether straying from your course, or driven by storms (for such things sailors often suffer on the high seas), you have entered the river banks and lie in haven, shun not our welcome, and be not unaware that the Latins are Saturn’s race, righteous not by bond or laws, but self-controlled of their own free will and by the custom of their ancient god. And in truth I remember, though time has dimmed the tale, that Auruncan elders told how in this land Dardanus was born,
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] and hence passed to the towns of Phrygian Ida and Thracian Samos, that men now call Samothrace. It was from here, from the Tuscan home of Corythus, he came, and now the golden palace of the starry sky admits him to a throne, and he increases the number of altars of the gods.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He ceased, and Ilioneus followed thus: “O King, illustrious seed of Faunus, no black storm has tossed us on the waves and driven us to seek shelter in your lands, nor has star or shore misled us in our course. Of set purpose and with willing hearts do we draw near to this city of yours, exiled from a realm once the greatest that the sun beheld as he journeyed from the uttermost heaven. From Jove
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] is the origin of our race; in Jove, their ancestor, the sons of Dardanus glory; of Jove’s supreme race is our king himself,

	Trojan Aeneas, who has sent us to your doors. How fierce the storm that burst from cruel Mycenae and passed over the plains of Ida; how, driven by fate, the two worlds of Europe and Asia clashed—this has come to the ears of all whom the farthest land where Ocean is flung back keeps far away, and of all whom the zone of the tyrannous sun, stretched in the middle of the four, severs from us.
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] From that deluge we have sailed over many waste seas, and now crave a scant home for our country’s gods, a harmless landing place, and air and water free to all. We shall be no shame to the realm, nor shall your renown be lightly told or the grace of such a deed grow faint, nor shall Ausonia repent of having welcomed Troy to her breast. By the fortunes of Aeneas I swear, and by his right hand, found strong when any tested it for loyalty or in war and arms: many are the peoples, many the nations—scorn us not, that of ourselves we proffer garlands with our hands and address to you words of suppliance—who have sought us for themselves and craved our alliance; but the will of heaven has forced us by its behests to seek out your shores. From here Dardanus came forth, hither Apollo calls us back and with high decrees urges us to Tuscan Tiber and the sacred waters of the Numician spring. Further, to you our king offers these poor tokens of his former fortune—relics snatched from burning Troy. With this gold did his father Anchises pour libation at the altars; this was Priam’s array when after his wont he gave laws to the assembled nations—the sceptre, the sacred diadem, and the robes wrought by Ilium’s daughters. . . .”

	At these words of Ilioneus Latinus holds his face fixed in steady gaze downward, moving his eyes in deepthought. Nor is it so much that the embroidered purple or the sceptre of Priam moves the king, as that he broods over his daughter’s wedlock and bridal bed, and revolves in his breast the oracle of ancient Faunus. “This,” he thought, “must be he who, coming from a stranger’s home, is predestined by the fates as my son, and called to sovereignty with equal power; his must be the offspring, glorious in valour, whose might is to master all the world.” At last, in gladness, he speaks: “May the gods prosper our intent and their own prophecy! Trojan, your wish shall be granted; nor do I spurn your gifts. While Latinus is king, you shall not lack the bounty of a fruitful soil, nor Troy’s abundance. Only let Aeneas, if so he longs for us, if he is eager to join us in amity and be called our ally, let him come in person and shrink not from friendly eyes. To me it shall be a term of the peace to have touched your sovereign’s hand! Now in turn take back to the king my answer: I have a daughter whom oracles from my father’s shrine and countless prodigies from heaven do not allow me to unite to a bridegroom of our race; sons shall come from shores of strangers—such destiny, they foretell, awaits Latium—whose blood shall exalt our name to the stars. That this is he on whom fate calls, I both think, and, if my soul forebodes aught of truth, I wish it too.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	With these words the old king picks out horses from all his number—three hundred stood sleek in their high stalls. At once for all the Teucrians in order he commands them to be led forth, fleet of foot and caparisoned with purple and embroidered housings. Golden are the chains that hang low from their breasts, of gold are their trap­pings,

	But the fierce wife of Jove was coming back from Argos, city of Inachus, holding her airy flight; and from the sky afar, all the way from Sicilian Pachynus, she espied the rejoicing Aeneas and his Dardan fleet. She sees them already building a home, already trusting in the land, their ships deserted. She stopped, pierced with sharp grief; then, shaking her head, pours forth from her breast these words: “Ah! hated race, and Phrygian fates that cross my own! Could they not have perished on the Sigean plains? Captured, could they not have suffered captivity? Did the fires of Troy consume them? No! through the midst of armies, through the midst of flames, they have found a way. But I think my power at last lies outworn; or my wrath is sated, and I rest! Nay more, when they were hurled forth from their country, with my vengeance I dared to follow the exiles through the waves and confront them over all the deep: against the Teucrians has been spent all the power of sea and sky. Yet what have the Syrtes availed me, or Scylla, what yawning Charybdis? They find shelter in Tiber’s longed-for channel, heedless of ocean and of me. Mars could destroy the Lapiths’ giant race; the very father of the gods yielded ancient Calydon to Diana’s wrath,

But I, Jove’s mighty consort, who have endured, poor wretch, to leave nothing undared, who have turned myself to every shift, I am worsted by Aeneas!

	of Night, this service, a boon all my own, that my honour and glory not yield overmastered, and that the sons of Aeneas be not able to cajole Latinus with wedlock or beset the borders of Italy. You can arm for strife brothers of one soul, and overturn homes with hate; you can bring under the roof the lash and funeral torch; you have a thousand names, a thousand means of ill. Rouse your fertile bosom, shatter the pact of peace, sow seeds of wicked war! In the same hour let the men crave, demand, and seize the sword!”

	At this Allecto, steeped in Gorgonian venom, first seeks Latium and the high halls of the Laurentine king, and sits down before the silent threshold of Amata, who, with a woman’s distress, a woman’s passion, was seething with frenzy over the Teucrian’s coming and Turnus’ marriage. On her the goddess flings a snake from her dusky tresses, and thrusts it into her bosom, into her inmost heart, that maddened by the pest she may embroil all the house. Gliding between her raiment and smooth breasts, it winds its way unfelt and, unseen by the frenzied woman, breathes into her its viperous breath. The huge snake becomes the collar of twisted gold about her neck, becomes the festoon of the long fillet, entwines itself into her hair, and slides smoothly over her limbs. And while first the taint, stealing on in fluent poison, thrills her senses and wraps her bones with fire, and her soul has not yet caught the flame throughout her breast, softly, and as mothers are wont, she spoke, shedding many a tear over her daughter’s and the Phrygian’s wedlock: “Is it to exiled Teucrians Lavinia is given as wife, O father? And have you no pity on your daughter and yourself? Have you no pity on her mother, whom with the first North Wind the faithless

As at times a top, spinning under the twisted lash, which boys intent on the game drive in a great circle through an empty court—urged by the whip it speeds on round after round; the ignorant childish throng hang over it in wonder, marvelling at the whirling boxwood; the blows give it life: so, no slacker in her course, is she driven through the midst of cities and proud peoples. Nay more, feigning the spirit of Bacchus, essaying a greater sin and launching a greater madness, she flies forth to the forest, and hides her daughter in the leafy mountains, in order by this means to rob the Teucrians of their marriage and

It is for you, in truth, she takes up the waving thyrsus, to you she pays honour in the dance, for you she grows her sacred tresses.” Fame flies abroad, and the matrons, their breasts kindled with fury, are driven on, all by the same frenzy, to seek new dwellings. They have left their homes, and bare their necks and hair to the winds, while some fill the sky with tremulous cries and, clad in fawn skins, carry vine-bound spears. Herself in their midst, the frenzied queen uplifts a blazing brand of pine and sings the marriage song of her daughter and Turnus, rolling her blood-shot eyes; then of a sudden she fiercely shouts: “Ho! mothers of Latium, give ear, wherever you are! If in your loyal hearts still lives affection for unhappy Amata, if care for a mother’s rights stings your souls, loose the fillets from your hair, join the revels with me!” So fares it with the queen, as amid woods, amid wild beasts’ coverts, Allecto drives her far and wide with Bacchic goad.

	As soon as she deemed that she had whetted enough the first shafts of frenzy, and had overturned Latinus’ purpose and all his household, forthwith the gloomy goddess flies hence on dusky wings to the walls of the bold Rutulian, the city which Danaë, they say, borne thither by the headlong South Wind, built with her Acrisian settlers.

The king denies you your bride and the dowry your blood has won, and a stranger is sought as heir to your throne. So go now, confront thankless perils, scorned as you are: go, lay low the Tuscan ranks; shield the Latins with peace. This it was that Saturn’s almighty daughter in person bade me say to you as you were lying in the stillness of night. Rise then, and gladly make ready the arming of your men, and their march from the gates into the fields. Burn the Phrygian chiefs, who are anchored in our fair stream, burn their painted ships. The mighty force of the gods commands. Let King Latinus himself, unless he consents to give you your bride and stand by his word, know of it, and at last make proof of Turnus as a foe.”

	Now the youth, mocking the seer, thus in turn takes up the speech: “That a fleet has entered Tiber’s waters, the news has not, as you suppose, escaped my ear—feign not for me such terrors; and Queen Juno does not forget me . . . But you, mother, old age, enfeebled by decay and barren of truth, frets with vain distress, and amid the feuds of kings mocks your prophetic soul with false alarms. Your charge it is to keepthe gods’ images and temples; war and peace men shall wield, whose work war is.”

	At these words Allecto blazed forth in fury. But even as the young man spoke, a sudden tremor seized his limbs, and his eyes set in fear; so many are the Fury’s hissing snakes, so monstrous the countenance that reveals itself.

	Then, rolling her flaming eyes, she thrust him back, as he faltered and sought to say more, reared two snakes from her tresses, sounded her whip, and spoke further with rabid lips: “Behold me, enfeebled by decay, whom old age, barren of truth, amid the feuds of kings, mocks with vain alarm! Look on this! I am come from the home of the Dread Sisters, and in my hand I bear war and death . . .”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So saying, she hurled at the youth a torch, and fixed in his breast the brand, smoking with lurid light. A monstrous terror broke his sleep, and the sweat, bursting from all his frame, drenched bone and limb. For arms he madly shrieks; arms he seeks in couch and chamber; lust of the sword rages in him, the accursed frenzy of war, and resentment crowning all: just as when flaming sticks, loud crackling, are heaped under the sides of a billowing cauldron, and the waters dance with the heat; within seethes the liquid flood, steaming and bubbling uphigh with foam; and now the wave contains itself no longer, and the black smoke soars aloft. Therefore, profaning peace, he orders his chief warriors to march upon Latinus, and bids arms be made ready. “Defend Italy,” he cries, “drive the foe from her borders; I come, a match for both Teucrians and Latins.” When thus he spoke, and called the gods to hear his vows, the Rutuli vie in exhorting one another to arms. One is moved by the peerless beauty of his form and youth, one by his royal ancestry, another by the glorious deeds of his hand.

	new wiles spying out the place, where, on the shore, fair Iülus was hunting wild beasts with nets and steeds. Here the hellish maid flings upon his hounds a sudden frenzy, and touches their nostrils with the well-known scent, so that in hot haste they course a stag. This was the first source of ill; this first kindled the rustic spirit to war. There was a stag of wondrous beauty and mighty antlers, which, torn from its mother’s breast, the sons of Tyrrhus nurtured, and Tyrrhus, their sire, controller of the royal herds and charged with care of pastures near and far. Their sister Silvia had trained it to obey, and with constant love she adorned it, twining its horns with soft garlands, combing the wild thing’s coat, and bathing it in the crystal spring. Tame to handling and accustomed to food from its master, it roved the woods, and of its own accord went home again to the well-known door, however late the night.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	While far afield the stag was straying, the maddened hounds of the huntsman Iülus started it, as by chance it swam down stream and cooled its heat on the grassy bank. Ascanius himself, too, fired with longing for chiefest honour, aimed a shaft from his bent bow, and the goddess did not fail his faltering hand; the reed whistled as it sped, and pierced belly and flank alike. But the wounded creature fled under the familiar roof, and moaning crept into its stall, where, bleeding and suppliant-like, it filled all the house with its plaints. First Silvia the sister, beating her arms with her hands, calls for helpand summons the hardy country folk. They—for the fell fiend lurks in the silent woods—came unlooked for, armed one with seared brand,

	But the cruel goddess, espying from her watchtower the moment of mischief, seeks the steep farm roof, and from the topmost ridge sounds the shepherds’ call, and on the twisted horn strains her hellish voice, at which at once every grove trembled and the woods echoed to their depths. It was heard by Trivia’s lake afar,
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] heard by Nar with his white sulphurous water, and by the springs of Velinus; and startled mothers clasped their children to their breasts. Then indeed, hurrying to the sound, with which the dread clarion gave the signal, the wild husband-men snatch uptheir weapons and gather from all sides; no less do the Trojan youth pour through the camp’s open gates to helpAscanius. The lines are ranged: now they do not contend in rustic quarrel with heavy clubs or seared stakes, but with two-edged steel they try the issue; far and wide bristles a dark harvest of drawn swords, while brass shines at the challenge of the sun and flings its light to the clouds: as when a billow begins to whiten under the wind’s first breath, little by little the sea swells and lifts its waves higher, till at last it rises to heaven from its lowest depths. Here in the front rank, young Almo, who had been eldest of Tyrrhus’ sons, is laid low by a whistling arrow; for the wound was fixed beneath his throat, choking with blood the path of liquid speech and the slender breath.

	While thus over the plains they fight in even warfare, the goddess, her promise fulfilled, when once she has stained with blood and opened with death the first encounter, quits Hesperia, and turning away through the air of heaven, addresses Juno in haughty tones of triumph: “Lo, at your will, discord is ripened into gloomy war. Bid them unite in friendship and join alliance, seeing that I have sprinkled the Teucrians with Ausonian blood. Moreover, this I will add, if I am assured of your wish: with rumours I will draw bordering towns to battle, and will kindle their minds with lust of maddening war, that from all sides they may come to aid; I will sow the land with arms.” Then Juno, in answer: “Enough of alarms and treachery; the causes of war are established; man with man they fight in arms, and the arms that chance first gave are now stained with fresh blood. Let this be the alliance, this the bridal they solemnize—this peerless son of Venus, and this great king Latinus! That you should roam too freely in the upper air, the mighty sire, sovereign of high Olympus, did not wish. Leave this place. Whatever issue of sorrow is still to come I will deal with myself.” So spoke Saturn’s daughter; but the other raises her serpent-hissing pinions and, leaving the heights above, seeks her home in Cocytus. There is a place in the heart of Italy, beneath high hills, renowned and famed in many lands, the Vale of Amsanctus. On either

	No less, meanwhile, does Saturn’s royal daughter put a final hand to the war. From the battlefield there pours into the city the whole company of shepherds, bearing back the slain—the boy Almo, and Galaesus with mangled face—calling on the gods and adjuring Latinus. Turnus is there, and amid the outcry at the slaughter, and fire of passion, he redoubles their terror: “Teucrians are called to reign; a Phrygian stock mingles its taint; I am spurned from the door!” Then they, whose matrons, frenzied by Bacchus, tread the pathless woods in dancing bands (for of no light weight is Amata’s name), draw together from every side, and importune the War God. Straightway, one and all, despite the omens, despite the oracles of gods, with perverse will clamour for unholy war. With emulous zeal they swarm round Latinus’ palace. He, like an unmoved ocean cliff, resists; like an ocean cliff, which, when a great crash comes, stands steadfast in its bulk amid many howling waves; in vain the crags and foaming rocks roar about, and the seaweed, dashed upon its sides, is whirled back. But when no power is given him to quell their blind resolve, and all goes as cruel Juno wills, then with many an appeal to the gods and the voiceless skies, “Alas!” the father cries, “we are shattered by fate, and swept away by the storm!

	A custom there was in Hesperian Latium, which thenceforth the Alban cities held holy, as now does Rome, mistress of the world, when they first rouse the war god to battle, be it Getae or Arabs or Hyrcanians against whom their hands prepare to carry tearful war, or to march on India’s sons

	and on their turning hinges Saturn’s daughter burst open the iron-bound gates of war. All ablaze is Ausonia, which before was sluggish and unmoved. Some make ready to march over the plains on foot, some, mounted on high steeds, storm amid clouds of dust: all cry out for arms. Some with rich fat burnish shields smooth and javelins bright, and whet axes on the stone; they joy to bear the standards, and hear the trumpet call. And five mighty cities set up anvils and forge new weapons—strong Atina and proud Tibur, Ardea and Crustumeri and turreted Antemnae. They hollow helmets to guard the head, and weave the wicker frame of shields; others beat out breast-plates of bronze, or polished greaves from pliant silver. To this is come all pride in share and sickle, all passion for the plough; they retemper in the furnace their fathers’ swords. And now the clarion sounds; the password goes forth, the sign for war. One in wild haste snatches a helmet from his home; another harnesses his quivering steeds to the yoke, dons his shield and coat of mail, triple-linked with gold, and girds on his trusty sword.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Now fling Helicon wide open, goddesses, and set on foot poetic strains, telling what kings were roused to war; what embattled hosts followed each one, filling the plain; with what manhood even then did kindly Italy bloom; what armed forces kindled her to flame. For you, divine sisters, have both remembrance and power to relate, while to us is scarce wafted some scant breath of fame.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	First into the war comes the ferocious king from Tuscan coasts, Mezentius, scorner of the gods, and arrays his bands. At his side stands his son Lausus, whom none surpassed in beauty of physique save Laurentine Turnus. Lausus, tamer of horses, vanquisher of beasts, leads from

	After these, Aventinus, handsome son of handsome Hercules, displays on the grass his palm-crowned chariot and victorious steeds, and on his shield bears his father’s blazon—a hundred snakes and the Hydra, girt with serpents. Him, in the wood of the Aventine hill, the priestess Rhea bore in secret birth into the borders of light—a woman mated with a god—when the conquering Tirynthian, having slain Geryon, reached the Laurentian fields and bathed his Iberian oxen in the Tuscan stream.

With him marches, spreading far around, a troop levied among the fields, warriors dwelling in steep Praeneste, in the ploughlands of Juno who guards Gabii, by cool Anio and among Hernican rocks bedewed by streams; they whom you nurture, rich Anagnia, and you, father Amasenus. Not all of these have armour or shields, or rattling chariots. Mostly they shower bullets of dull lead; some wield two darts in the hand, and have for headgear tawny caps of wolf skin. Bare is the left foot as they plant their steps; a boot of rawhide shields the other.

These hold the ranks of Fescennium and of Aequi Falisci; these Soracte’s heights and Flavinian fields, Ciminus’ lake and hill and the groves of Capena.

The bucklers clang, and the earth trembles under the tramping feet.

	Next, Agamemnon’s son, foe of the Trojan name, Halaesus, yokes his steeds to the car, and in Turnus’ cause sweeps along a thousand warlike tribes, men who turn with mattocks the wine-rich Massic lands; whom Auruncan fathers sent from their high hills, and the Sidicine plains hard by; those who leave Cales, and the dweller by Volturnus’ shallow river, and by their side the rough Saticulan and the Oscan bands.

For they tell that Hippolytus—when he fell by his stepmother’s arts, and satisfied his father’s vengeance with his blood, torn asunder by frightened steeds—came again to the starry firmament and heaven’s upper air, recalled by the Healer’s herbs and Diana’s love. Then the Father omnipotent, angered that any mortal should rise from the nether shades to the light of life, himself with his thunder hurled down to the Stygian waters the finder of such healing craft, the one born of Phoebus.
	[c dimgray][sup]32[/sup][/c] But Trivia, kindly goddess, hides Hippolytus in a secret dwelling, and sends him away to the nymph Egeria and her grove, that there alone, amid Italian woods, he might live out his inglorious days, and take the altered name of Virbius. For this reason, too, hoofed horses are kept far from Trivia’s temple and hallowed groves, that they, frightened by ocean monsters, strewed chariot and youth along the shore. None the less, his son was driving his fiery steeds on the level plain, and hastened to war in his chariot.

	[c dimgray][sup]35[/sup][/c] over whose fields Jupiter of Anxur reigns, and Feronia rejoicing in her greenwood; where Satura’s black marsh lies, and cold Ufens winds his way through the valley depths and sinks into the sea.

	To crown the array comes Camilla, of Volscian race, leading her troopof horse, and squadrons gay with brass—a warrior maid, never having trained her woman’s hands to Minerva’s distaff or basket of wool, but hardy to bear the brunt of battle and in speed of foot to outstrip the winds. She might have flown over the topmost blades of unmown corn, and not bruised the tender ears in her course; or sped her way over mid sea, poised above the swelling wave, and not dipped her swift feet in the flood. All the youth, streaming from house and field, and thronging matrons marvel, and gaze at her as she goes; agape with wonder at how the glory of royal purple drapes her smooth shoulders, how the clasp entwines her hair with gold, how her own hands bear a Lycian quiver and the pastoral myrtle tipped with steel.

	When Turnus raised up the flag of war from the Laurentine citadel and the horns rang with their hoarse notes, when he roused his fiery steeds and clashed his arms, straightway men’s hearts were troubled; all Latium at once swears allegiance in eager uprising, and her sons rage madly. The chief captains, Messapus and Ufens, with Mezentius, scorner of the gods, from all sides muster forces and strip the wide fields of farmers. Venulus too is sent to mighty Diomedes’ city
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] to seek aid, and announce that Teucrians are settling in Latium; that Aeneas is come with his fleet, bringing in his vanquished gods, and proclaiming himself a king summoned by Fate; that many tribes are joining the Dardan hero and his name spreads far and wide in Latium. What end he compasses with these beginnings, what outcome of the feud he craves, should Fortune attend him, would be more clearly seen by Diomedes himself than by King Turnus or King Latinus.

	Thus it was in Latium. The hero of Laomedon’s line, seeing it all, tosses on a mighty sea of troubles; and now this way, now that he swiftly throws his mind, casting it in diverse ways, and turning it to every shift; as when in

	It was night, and over all lands deep sleep held wearied creatures, birds and beasts alike, when father Aeneas, his heart troubled by woeful war, lay down on the bank under the vault of the cold sky, and let sleepat last steal over his limbs. He dreamed that before him the very god of the place, Tiberinus of the pleasant stream, raised his aged head amid the poplar leaves; fine linen draped him in a mantle of grey, and shady reeds crowned his hair. Then thus he spoke to him, and with these words took away his cares:

	Pallas, who were the company of King Evander and followed his banner, have chosen a site and set their city on the hills, from their forefather Pallas called Pallanteum. They wage war ceaselessly with the Latin race; them you must take to your camp as allies, and join with them in league. I myself will guide you along the banks straight up the stream, that so, impelled by your oars, you may overcome the opposing current. Up, arise, goddess-born, and, as the stars first set, duly offer prayers to Juno, and with suppliant vows vanquish her wrath and her threats. To me you will pay your tribute when victorious. I am he whom you see grazing my banks with full flood and cleaving the rich tilth—the blue Tiber, river best beloved of Heaven. Here is my mighty home; among lofty cities flows forth my fountainhead.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	So spoke the River, then plunged into his deep pool, seeking the lowest depths; night and sleep left Aeneas. He arises and, gazing toward the eastern beams of the celestial sun, uplifts water from the stream in his hollow palms as use ordains, and pours forth to Heaven this prayer: “O Nymphs, Laurentine Nymphs, from whom rivers have their being, and you, father Tiber, you and your hallowed stream—receive Aeneas, and at last shield him from perils. In whatever spring your water contains you as you pity our travails, from whatever soil you flow forth in all your beauty, ever with my offerings, ever with my gifts, you will be graced, horned stream, lord of Hesperian waters. Only be with me, and confirm your will with your presence.” So he speaks, and choosing two galleys from his fleet mans them with crews, and at once equips his comrades with arms.

	But lo! a portent, sudden and wondrous to see. Gleaming white through the wood, of one colour with her milk-white brood, there lay outstretched on the green bank before their eyes a sow; good Aeneas offers her in sacrifice to you, indeed to you, most mighty Juno, and sets her with her young before your altar. All that night long Tiber calmed his swelling flood, and flowing back with silent wave so halted that like a gentle pool or quiet mere he smoothed his watery plain, so that the oars might know no struggle. Therefore with cheering cries they speed the voyage they have begun; over the waters glides the well-pitched pine; in wonder the waves, in wonder the woods unused to such a sight, view the far-gleaming shields of warriors and the painted hulls floating on the stream. They with their rowing give night and day no rest, pass the long bends, are shaded with diverse trees, and cleave the green woods on the calm surface.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] The fiery sun had scaled the mid arch of heaven, when at a distance they see walls and a citadel, and scattered rooftops which today Roman might has exalted to heaven, but then Evander ruled, a scant domain. Quickly they turn the prows to land and draw near the town.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	It chanced that on that day the Arcadian king was paying wonted homage to Amphitryon’s mighty son
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] and the gods in a grove before the city. With him his son Pallas, with him all the foremost of his people and his humble senate were offering incense, and the warm blood smoked at the altars. When they saw the high ships, saw them gliding

	up between the shady woods and noiselessly plying their oars, they are alarmed by the sudden sight, and rise up as one, quitting the feast. But Pallas, undaunted, forbids them to break off the rites and, seizing his spear, flies to meet the strangers himself, and from a mound at a distance cries: “Warriors, what cause has driven you to try unknown paths? Where are you heading? Of what race are you? From what home? Is it peace or war you bring hither?” Then father Aeneas speaks thus from the high stern, holding out in his hand a branch of peaceful olive: “You see men of Trojan stock and arms hostile to Latins—men whom they have driven to flight by insolent warfare. We seek Evander; bear this message, and say that chosen captains of Dardania are come, suing for alliance in arms.” Pallas was astounded, struck by that mighty name. “Come forth,” he cries, “whoever you are; speak to my father face to face, and come as a guest beneath our roof!” And with a graspof welcome he caught and clung to his hand. Advancing, they enter the grove and leave the river.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then with friendly words Aeneas addresses the king: “Noblest of the sons of Greece, to whom Fortune has willed that I make my prayer, and offer boughs decked with fillets, I was not afraid that you were a Danaan chief, an Arcadian and linked by blood with the twin sons of Atreus; but my own worth and Heaven’s holy oracles, our ancestral kinship, and your fame that has spread through the world, have bound me to you, and led me here as Fate’s willing follower. Dardanus, first father and founder of Ilium’s city, born (as Greeks relate) of Atlantean Electra, came to the Teucrians; Electra was begotten of mightiest Atlas, who on his shoulders sustains the heavenly spheres.

The same Daunian race pursues us, as you, in cruel war; if they drive us forth, they deem that nothing will keep them from laying all Hesperia utterly beneath their yoke, and from holding the seas that wash her above and below.
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] Take and give friendship; we have hearts valiant in war, high souls and manhood tried in action.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Aeneas finished speaking. As he spoke, Evander’s gaze had long scanned his face and eyes, and all his form; then thus briefly he replies: “Bravest of the Teucrians, how gladly I receive and recognize you! How I recall your father’s words, and the voice and features of great Anchises! For I remember how Priam, Laomedon’s son, when on his way to Salamis he came to see the realm of his sister Hesione, passed on to visit Arcadia’s cold borders. In those days early youth clothed my cheeks with bloom, and I wondered at the chiefs of Troy, wondered at their prince, Laomedon’s son; but towering above all walked Anchises. My heart burned with youthful ardour to speak to him and clasp hand in hand; I drew near, and led him eagerly to Pheneus’ city. When he left, he gave me a glorious quiver with Lycian shafts, a scarf woven with gold, and a pair of

	This said, he orders the repast and cups, by now removed, to be replaced, and with his own hand ranges the guests on the grassy seat, and chief in honour he welcomes Aeneas to the cushion of a shaggy lion’s hide, and invites him to a maple throne. Then chosen youths, and the priest of the altar, in emulous haste bring roast flesh of bulls, pile on baskets the gifts of Ceres, fashioned well, and serve the wine of Bacchus. Aeneas and with him the warriors of Troy feast on the long chine of an ox and the sacrificial meat.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	When hunger was banished and the desire of food stayed, King Evander spoke: “These solemn rites, this wonted feast, this altar of a mighty Presence—it is no idle superstition, ignorant of the gods of old, that has laid them on us. Saved from cruel perils, Trojan guest, we celebrate the rites, and repeat the worship due. Now first look at this rocky overhanging cliff, how the masses are scattered afar, how the mountain dwelling stands desolate, and the crags have toppled down in mighty ruin. Here once was a cave, receding to unfathomed depth, never visited by the sun’s rays, where dwelt the awful shape of half-human Cacus; and ever the ground reeked with fresh blood, and, nailed to its proud doors, faces of men hung pallid in ghastly de­cay.

	This monster’s father was Vulcan; his were the black fires he belched forth, as he moved with massive bulk. In due course, time brought the help and presence of a god. For to us, too, in our need, the mightiest of avengers, glorying in the slaughter and spoils of triple Geryon, Hercules came, and this way drove his huge bulls in triumph, and his oxen filled vale and riverside. But Cacus, his wits wild with frenzy, that no crime or craft might prove to be left un-dared or untried, drove from their stalls four bulls of surpassing form, and as many heifers of peerless beauty. And that there might be no tracks pointing forward, the rustler dragged them by the tail into his cave, and, with the signs of their course thus turned backwards, the thief hid them in the rocky darkness: anyone who sought them could find no marks leading to the cave. Meanwhile, when Amphitryon’s son was now moving the well-fed herds from their stalls and making ready to set out, the cattle lowed as they went; all the grove they fill with their plaint, and with clamour quit the hills. One heifer returned the cry, lowed from the high cave’s depths, and from her prison baffled the hopes of Cacus. At this the wrath of Alcides furiously blazed forth with black gall; seizing in hand his weapons and heavily knotted club, he seeks with speed the crest of the steep mountain. Then first our people saw Cacus afraid and with trouble in his eyes; in a twinkling he flees swifter than the East Wind and seeks his cave; fear lends wings to his feet.

	craft and with its barrier blocked the firm-stayed entrance, there was the Tirynthian in a frenzy of wrath; scanning every approach, he turned his face this way and that, gnashing his teeth. Three times, hot with rage, he traverses the whole Aventine Mount; three times he tries the stony portals in vain; three times he sinks down exhausted in the valley. There stood a pointed rock of flint, cut sheer away all around, rising above the cavern’s ridge, and very tall to see, fit home for the nestlings of foul birds. This, as it leaned sloping with its ridge to the river on the left, he shook, straining against it from the right and, wrenching it from its lowest roots, tore it loose; then suddenly he thrust it forth; with that thrust the mighty heaven thunders, the banks leap apart, and the terrified river recoils. But the den of Cacus and his huge palace stood revealed and, deep below, the darkling cave lay open: just as if, through some force, the earth, gaping open deep below, were to unlock the infernal abodes and disclose the pallid realms abhorred by the gods, and from above the vast abyss be seen, and the ghosts tremble at the inrushing light. On him, then, caught suddenly by unexpected daylight, pent up in the hollow rock and bellowing as never before, Alcides hurls missiles from above, calling all weapons to his aid, and rains upon him boughs and giant millstones. He, meanwhile, since now no other escape from peril was left, belches from his throat dense smoke, wondrous to tell, and veils the dwelling in blinding darkness, blotting all view from the eyes, and rolling up in the cave’s depth smoke-laden night, its blackness mingled with flame.

	Alcides did not tolerate this: headlong he dashed through the flame, where the smoke rolls its wave thickest, and through the mighty cave the mist surges black. Here, as Cacus in the darkness vomits forth unavailing fires, he seizes him in a knot-like embrace and, close entwined, throttles him till the eyes burst forth and the throat is drained of blood. At once the doors are torn off and the dark den laid bare; the stolen oxen and the theft he had denied are shown to heaven, and the hideous carcase is dragged forth by the feet. Men cannot sate their hearts with gazing on the terrible eyes, the face, and shaggy bristling chest of the brutish creature, and the quenched fires of his throat. From that time has this rite been solemnized and joyous posterity has kept the day—Potitius foremost, founder of the rite, and the Pinarian house, custodian of the worship of Hercules. He himself set in the grove this altar, which shall always be called Mightiest by us, and mightiest it shall always be. Come then, warriors, and, in honour of deeds so glorious, wreath your hair with leaves, and stretch forth the cup in your hands; call on our common god, and with a will pour forth the wine.” He had no sooner spoken than the variegated poplar veiled his hair with the shade dear to Hercules, hanging down with a festoon of leaves, and the sacred goblet charged his hand. Speedily all pour glad libation on the board, and offer prayer to the gods.

Then the Salii come to sing round the kindled altars, their brows bound with poplar boughs—one band of youths, the other of old men—and these in song extol the glories and deeds of Hercules: how first he strangled in his grip the twin serpents, the monsters of his stepmother;
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] how likewise in war he dashed down peerless cities, Troy and Oechalia; how under King Eurystheus he bore a thousand grievous toils by the doom of cruel Juno. “You, unconquered one, you with your hand are slayer of the cloud-born creatures of double shape, Hylaeus and Pholus, the monsters of Crete, and the huge lion beneath Nemea’s rock. Before you the Stygian lakes trembled; before you, the warder of Hell as he lay on half-gnawn bones in his bloody cave; no shape daunted you, no, not Typhoeus himself, towering aloft in arms; your wits did not fail you when Lerna’s snake encompassed you with its swarm of heads. Hail, true seed of Jove, to the gods an added glory! Graciously with favouring foot visit us and your rites!” Such are their hymns of praise; and they crown all with the tale of Cacus’ cavern, and the fire-breathing monster himself. All the woodland rings with the clamour, and the hills resound.

	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] who had no rule or art of life, and knew not how to yoke the ox or to lay upstores, or to husband their gains; but tree branches nurtured them and the huntsman’s savage fare. First from heavenly Olympus came Saturn, fleeing from the weapons of Jove and exiled from his lost realm. He gathered together the unruly race, scattered over mountain heights, and gave them laws, and chose that the land be called Latium, since in these borders he had found a safe hiding place.
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] Under his reign were the golden ages men tell of: in such perfect peace he ruled the nations; till little by little there crept in a race of worse sort and duller hue, the frenzy of war, and the passion for gain.

	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] valiant Romulus restored an asylum, and, beneath a chill rock, the Lupercal, bearing in Arcadian fashion the name of Lycaean Pan. He shows too the wood of holy Argiletum, and calls the place to witness, and tells of the death of Argus his guest.
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] From here he leads him to the Tarpeian house, and the Capitol—golden now, then bristling with woodland thickets. Even then the dread sanctity of the region awed the trembling rustics; even then they shuddered at the forest and the rock. “This grove,” he cries, “this hill with its leafy crown—though we know not what god it is—is yet a god’s home; my Arcadians believe they have looked on Jove himself, when as often happens, his right hand has shaken the darkening aegis and summoned the storm clouds. Moreover, in these two towns with their walls overthrown you see the relics and memorials of men of old. This fort father Janus built, that Saturn; Janiculum was this called, that Saturnia.”

	So talking to each other, they came to the house of humble Evander, and saw cattle all about, lowing in the Roman Forum and in the fashionable Carinae. When they reached his dwelling, he cries: “These portals victorious Alcides stooped to enter; this mansion had room for him.

Night rushes down, and clasps the earth with dusky wings.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But Venus, her mother’s heart dismayed by no idle fear, moved by the threats and fierce uprising of the Laurentes, addresses Vulcan, and in her golden nuptial chamber thus begins, breathing into her words divine allurement: “While the kings of Argos ravaged Troy’s doomed towers in war, and her ramparts that were fated to fall by hostile flames, no aid for the sufferers did I ask, no weapons of your art and power; no, dearest husband, I did not wish to put you or your endeavors to work for nothing, heavy as was my debt to Priam’s sons, and many the tears I shed for Aeneas’ sore distress. Now, by Jove’s commands, he has set foot in Rutulian territory; therefore, I, who never asked before, come as a suppliant, and ask arms of the deity I revere, a mother for her son. You the daughter of Nereus, you the spouse of Tithonus could sway with tears.
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] See what nations are mustering, what cities with closed gates whet the sword against me and the lives of my people!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	The goddess ceased, and as he falters throws her snowy arms round him and fondles him in soft embrace. At once he felt the usual flame; the familiar warmth passed into his marrow and ran through his melting frame: just as when at times, bursting amid the thunder’s peal, a sparkling

Then spoke Father Vulcan, enchained by immortal love: “Why do you seek so far back for reasons? Where, goddess, has your faith in me fled to? Had your anxiety been the same then, in those days too it would have been right for me to arm the Trojans; neither the almighty Father nor Fate was unwilling that Troy stand or Priam live for ten years more. And now, if war is your purpose and this is your intent, whatever care I can promise in my craft, whatever can be achieved with iron or molten electrum, whatever fire and air may avail—cease to mistrust your powers by using entreaty!” Saying these words, he gave her the desired embrace and, melting in his wife’s arms, sought quiet sleep in every limb.

	Then, when repose had banished sleep, in the mid career of now waning night, at the time when a housewife, whose task it is to eke out life with her distaff and Minerva’s humble toil, awakes the embers and slumbering fire, adding night to her day’s work, and keeps her handmaids toiling by lamplight at the long task, so that she can keep her husband’s bed chaste and rear her little sons: just so, and not more slothful at that hour, the Lord of Fire rises from his soft couch to the work of his smithy.

	In the vast cave the Cyclopes were forging iron—Brontes and Steropes and bare-limbed Pyracmon. They had a thunderbolt, which their hands had shaped, like the many that the Father hurls down from all over heaven upon earth, in part already polished, while part remained unfinished. Three shafts of twisted hail they had added to it, three of watery cloud, three of ruddy flame and the winged South Wind; now they were blending into the work terrifying flashes, noise, and fear, and wrath with pursuing flames. Elsewhere they were hurrying on for Mars a chariot and flying wheels, with which he stirs upmen and cities; and eagerly with golden scales of serpents were burnishing the awful aegis, armour of wrathful Pallas, the interwoven snakes, and on the breast of the goddess the Gorgon herself, with neck severed and eyes revolving. “Away with all!” he cries. “Remove the tasks you have begun, Cyclopes of Aetna, and turn your thoughts to this! Arms for a brave warrior you must make. Now you have need of strength, now of swift hands, now of all your masterful skill. Throw off delay!” No more he said; but they with speed all bent to the toil, allotting the labour equally. Bronze and golden ore flow in streams, and wounding steel is molten in the vast furnace.

	come here. Not far from here, built of ancient stone, lies the site of the city of Agylla, where of old the war-famed Lydian race settled on the Etruscan heights. For many years it prospered, till King Mezentius ruled it with arrogant sway and cruel arms. Why recount the despot’s heinous murders, his savage deeds? May the gods store up such treatment for his own head and for his breed! He would even link dead bodies with the living, fitting hand to hand and face to face (grim torture!), and, in the oozy slime and poison of that ghastly embrace, thus slay them by a lingering death. But at last his exhausted citizens take up arms and besiege the monstrous madman, himself and his palace, cut down his followers, and hurl fire on his roof. Amid the carnage, he flees for refuge to Rutulian soil and finds shelter among the weapons of Turnus his friend. So all Etruria has risen in righteous fury; threatening instant war they demand the king for punishment. Of these thousands, Aeneas, I will make you chief; for their ships throng all the shore clamouring, and they bid the standards advance, but the aged soothsayer restrains them with prophecy of fate: ‘Chosen warriors of Maeonia, flower and chivalry of an ancient race, you whom just resentment launches against the foe, and Mezentius inflames with righteous wrath, it is not right that any man of Italy should control a race so proud: choose leaders from abroad!’ At that the Etruscan lines settled down on yonder plain, awed by Heaven’s warning; Tarchon himself has sent me envoys with the royal crown and sceptre, and offers the ensigns of power, bidding me join the camp and mount the Tuscan

My son I would urge to accept, were it not that, being of mixed blood, with a Sabine mother, he draws part of his nationality from her. You, to whose years and race Fate is kind, whom Heaven calls, take up your task, most valiant leader of Trojans and Italians both. Further, I will join with you Pallas here, our hope and comfort; under your guidance let him learn to endure warfare and the stern work of battle; let him behold your deeds, and revere you from his early years. To him I will give two hundred Arcadian cavalry, choice flower of our manhood, and as his own gift Pallas will give you as many more.”

	Scarce had he ended; and Aeneas son of Anchises and faithful Achates, holding their eyes downcast, would long have mused on many a trouble in their own sad hearts, had not Cythera’s queen granted a sign from the cloudless sky. For unexpectedly, launched from heaven, comes a flash with thunder, and everything seemed suddenly to reel, while the Tyrrhenian trumpet blast pealed through the sky. They glance up; again and yet again crashed the mighty roar. In the serene expanse of the sky they see arms amid the clouds, gleaming red in the clear air and clashing in thunder. The rest stood aghast; but the Trojan hero knew the sound and the promise of his goddess mother. Then he cries: “Ask not, my friend, ask not, I pray, what fortune the portents bode; it is I who am summoned by Heaven. This sign the goddess who bore me foretold she would send if war was at hand, and to aid me would bring through the air

	These words said, he rose from his lofty throne, and first quickens the slumbering altars with fire to Hercules, and gladly approaches the Lar of yesterday

Next he goes to the ships and revisits his men, of whose number he chooses the foremost in valour to attend him to war; the rest glide down the stream and idly float with the favouring current, to bear news to Ascanius of his father and his fortunes. Horses are given to the Teucrians who seek the Tyrrhene fields; for Aeneas they lead forth a chosen steed, all caparisoned in a tawny lion’s skin, glittering with claws of gold.

	Suddenly, spreading through the little town, flies a rumour that horsemen are speeding to the shores of the Tyrrhene king. In alarm mothers redouble their vows; fear comes closer because of the danger, and the War God’s image now looms larger. Then Evander, clasping the hand of his departing son, clings to him weeping insatiably and thus speaks: “If only Jupiter would bring me back the years that are sped, and make me what I was when under Praeneste’s very walls I struck down the foremost ranks, burned the piled up shields in my triumph, and with this right hand sent down to Tartarus King Erulus, whom at his

Never on this his neighbour’s head would Mezentius have heaped scorn, dealt with the sword so many cruel deaths, nor widowed the city of so many of her sons! But you powers above, and you, Jupiter, mighty ruler of the gods, pity, I pray, the Arcadian king, and hear a father’s prayer. If your will, if destiny keep my Pallas safe, if I live still to see him, still to meet him, for life I pray; I have patience to endure any toil. But if, Fortune, you threaten some dread mischance, now, oh, now may I break the thread of cruel life—while fears are doubtful, while hope reads not the future, while you, beloved boy, my late and lone delight, are held in my embrace; and may no heavier tidings wound my ear!” These words the father poured forth at their last parting; his servants bore him swooning into the palace.

	Near Caere’s cold stream there stands a vast grove, revered far and wide with ancestral awe; on all sides curving hills enclose it and girdle the woodland with dark fir trees. Rumour tells that the old Pelasgians who in time gone by first held the Latin borders dedicated both grove and festal day to Silvanus, god of fields and flock. Not far from there Tarchon and the Tyrrhenians camped in a sheltered spot, and now from a high hill all the host could be seen, their tents pitched in the wide fields. Hither come father Aeneas and the warriors chosen for battle, and refresh their steeds and wearied frames.

	But Venus, lovely goddess, drew near, bearing her gifts amid the clouds of heaven; and when far off she saw her son apart in a secluded valley by the cool stream, she thus addressed him, suddenly presenting herself to view; “Behold the gifts perfected by my lord’s promised skill, so that you do not shrink, my child, from soon challenging the haughty Laurentines or brave Turnus to battle.” Cytherea spoke, and sought her son’s embrace, and set up the radiant arms under an oak before him. Rejoicing in the divine gift and in this high honour, he cannot be sated as he moves his eyes from piece to piece, admiring and turning over in his hands and arms the helmet, terrifying with its plumes and spouting flames, the death-dealing sword, the stiff bronze corslet, blood-red and huge—just as when a dark

	There the story of Italy and the triumphs of Rome had the Lord of Fire fashioned, not unversed in prophecy or unknowing of the age to come; there, every generation of the stock to spring from Ascanius, and the wars they fought in their sequence. He had fashioned, too, the mother wolf lying stretched out in the green cave of Mars; around her teats the twin boys hung playing, and suckled their dam without fear; with shapely neck bent back, she fondled them by turns, and moulded their limbs with her tongue. Not far from here he had set Rome and the Sabine maidens, lawlessly carried off, when the great Circus games were held, from the theatre’s seated throng; then the sudden uprising of a fresh war between the sons of Romulus and aged Tatius and his stern Cures. Next, the same kings, their strife laid at rest, stood armed before Jove’s altar, cup in hand, and made covenant with each other over sacrifice of swine, and the palace was rough, fresh with the thatch of Romulus. Not far from there, four-horse chariots, driven apart, had torn Mettus asunder (but you, Alban, should have stood by your words!), and Tullus dragged the liar’s body through the woods, and the brambles dripped with dew of blood. There, too, was Porsenna, bidding them admit the banished Tarquin, and oppressing the city with mighty siege: the sons of Aeneas rushing on the sword for freedom’s sake. You could see him shown as angry, as threatening, because Cocles dared to tear down the bridge, and Cloelia broke her bonds and swam the river.

	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c] bringing in his train Egypt and the strength of the East and farthest Bactra; and there follows him (oh the shame of it!) his Egyptian wife. All rush on at once, and the whole sea foams, torn up by the sweeping oars and triple-pointed beaks. To the deep they race; you would think that the Cyclades, uprooted, were floating on the main, or that high mountains were clashing with mountains: in such huge ships the seamen attack the towered sterns. Flaming tow and shafts of winged steel are showered from their hands; Neptune’s fields redden with strange slaughter. In the midst the queen calls upon her hosts with their native sistrum; not yet does she cast back a glance at the twin snakes behind.
	[c dimgray][sup]26[/sup][/c] Monstrous gods of every form and barking Anubis wield weapons against Neptune and Venus and against Minerva.

	from above was bending his bow; in terror at this all Egypt and India, all Arabians, all Sabaeans, turned to flee. The queen herself was seen to woo the winds, spread sail, andv now, even now, fling loose the slackened sheets. Amid the carnage, the Lord of Fire had fashioned her pale at the coming of death, borne on by waves and the wind of Iapyx; while over against her was the mourning Nile, of massive body, opening wide his folds and with all his raiment welcoming the vanquished to his azure lap and sheltering streams.

	But Caesar, entering the walls of Rome in triple triumph,
	[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c] was dedicating to Italy’s gods his immortal votive gift—three hundred mighty shrines throughout the city. The streets were ringing with gladness and games and shouting; in all the temples was a band of matrons, in all were altars, and before the altars slain steers covered the ground. He himself, seated at the snowy threshold of shining Phoebus, reviews the gifts of nations and hangs them on the proud portals. The conquered peoples move in long array, as diverse in fashion of dress and arms as in tongues. Here Mulciber had portrayed the Nomad race and the un-girt Africans, here the Leleges and Carians and quivered Gelonians. Euphrates moved now with humbler waves, and the Morini were there, furthest of mankind, and the Rhine of double horn,

	“Turnus, what no god dared to promise to your prayers, see—the circling hour has brought unasked! Aeneas, leaving town, comrades and fleet, seeks the Palatine realm and Evander’s dwelling. Nor does that suffice; he has won his way to Corythus’ furthest cities,
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] and is mustering the Lydian country folk in armed bands. Why hesitate? Now, now is the hour to call for steed and chariot; break off delay, and seize the bewildered camp!” She spoke, and on poised wings rose into the sky, tracing in her flight a huge arch beneath the clouds. The youth knew her and, raising his two hands to heaven, with these words pursued her flight: “Iris, glory of the sky, who brought you down to me, wafted upon the clouds to earth? Whence this sudden brightness of the air? I see the heavens part asunder, and the stars that roam in the firmament.

	And now all the army was advancing on the open plain, rich in horses, rich in embroidered robes and gold—Messapus marshalling the van, the sons of Tyrrhus the rear, and Turnus their captain in the centre of the line, like Ganges, rising high in silence with his seven peaceful streams, or Nile, when his rich flood ebbs from the fields and at length he sinks into his channel. Here the Teucrians descry a sudden cloud gathering in black dust, and darkness rising on the plains. First from the rampart’s front Caïcus shouts, “What mass, my countrymen, rolls onward in murky gloom? Quick, bring your swords! Give out weapons, climb the walls! The enemy is upon us, ho!” With mighty clamour the Teucrians seek shelter through all the gates and man the ramparts. For so at his departure Aeneas, best of warriors, had charged: were anything to happen meanwhile, they should not dare to form their line or entrust themselves to the field; let them only guard camp and walls, secure behind their mound. Therefore, though shame and wrath prompt them to conflict, yet they bar the gates and do his bidding, awaiting the foe under arms and inside the hollow towers.

	crimson crest guards his head. “Men, is there anyone who with me will be first against the foe? See!” he cries, and whirling a javelin sends it skyward to start the battle and advances proudly over the plain. His comrades greet him with a shout, and follow with dreadful din; they marvel at the Teucrians’ craven hearts, crying: “They cannot trust themselves to a fair field, or face the foe in arms, but hug the camp.” Back and forth he rides wildly round the walls, seeking entrance where way is none. And as when a wolf, lying in wait at a crowded fold, growls beside the pens at midnight, enduring winds and rains; safe beneath their mothers the lambs keepbleating; fierce and reckless in his wrath, he rages against the prey beyond his reach, tormented by the long-gathering fury of famine, and by his dry, bloodless jaws; just so, as he scans wall and camp, the Rutulian’s wrath is aflame; resentment is hot within his iron bones. By what device can he attempt entrance? By what path hurl the penned Teucrians from their rampart, and pour them out over the plain? Close to the side of the camplay the fleet, fenced about with mounds and the flowing river; he attacks it, calling to his exulting comrades for fire, and in hot haste fills his hand with a blazing pine. Then indeed they fall to, spurred on by Turnus’ presence, and all the band arm themselves with murky torches. They have stripped the hearths; smoking brands fling a pitchy glare, and the Fire God carries the sooty cloud to heaven.

	In the days when on Phrygian Ida Aeneas was first fashioning his fleet and preparing to sail the deep seas, the very Mother of gods, it is said, the Berecyntian queen, spoke thus to mighty Jove: “Grant, son, to my prayer what your dear mother asks of you, now lord of Olympus.
	[c dimgray][sup]3[/sup][/c] A grove I had upon the mountain’s crest, where men brought me offerings—a pine forest beloved for many years, dim with dusky firs and trunks of maple. These, when he lacked a fleet, I gave gladly to the Dardan youth; now anxious fear tortures my troubled breast. Relieve my terrors, and let a mother achieve this by her prayers: that they be overcome by neither stress of voyage nor blast of wind. Let their birth on our hills be a boon to them.”

	To her replied her son, who sways the starry world: “Mother, where are you summoning fate? What are you asking for these ships of yours? Should hulls framed by mortal hand have immortal rights? And should Aeneas in certainty traverse uncertain perils? To what god is such power allowed? Nay, when one day, their service done, they gain an Ausonian haven, from all the ships that have escaped the waves, and borne the Dardan chief to the fields of Laurentum, I will take away their mortal shape, and bid them be goddesses of the great sea, like Doto, Nereus’ child, and Galatea, who cleave with their breasts the foaming deep.” He had spoken, and by the waters of his Stygian brother, by the banks that seethe with pitch in the black swirling abyss, he nodded assent, and with the nod made all Olympus tremble.

	So the promised day was come, and the Destinies had fulfilled their appointed times, when Turnus’ outrage warned the Mother to ward off the brands from her sacred ships. Then first there flashed upon the eyes a strange light, and from the Dawn a vast cloud was seen to speed across the sky, with Mount Ida’s dancing bands
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] in its train; then through the air fell an awful voice, filling the Trojan and Rutulian ranks: “Trouble not, you Teucrians, to defend my ships, and take not weapons into your hands. Turnus shall have leave to burn upthe seas sooner than my sacred pines. Go free, go, goddesses of ocean, the Mother bids it.” And at once each shiprends her cable from the bank, and like dolphins they dip their beaks and dive to the water’s depths; then as maiden forms—wondrous portent!—they resurface in like number and swim in the sea.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Amazed were the Rutulians at heart; Messapus himself was terror-stricken, his horses afraid; and the loud murmuring stream is stayed, as Tiberinus turns back his footsteps from the deep. But fearless Turnus did not lose heart; eagerly he raises their courage with his words, eagerly he chides them: “It is the Trojans that these portents are directed against; Jupiter himself has bereft them of their usual help; they do not await Rutulian sword and fire.
	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c] So the seas are pathless for the Teucrians, and they have no hope of flight. Half the world is lost to them, but the earth is in our hands: in such thousands are the nations of Italy under arms. I have no dread of all the fateful oracles of

	[c dimgray][sup]5[/sup][/c]Their “usual help” (i.e. the ships, which the gods have taken away) is a gibe of Turnus, implying that the normal reaction of the Trojans is flight, thus forestalling the Rutuli, who would otherwise have destroyed them with fire and sword.

	heaven of which these Phrygians boast: to Fate and Venus all claims are paid, since the Trojans have touched our rich Ausonia’s fields. I too have my own fate to meet theirs—to cut down with the sword a guilty race that has robbed me of my bride! Not only the sons of Atreus are touched by that pang, not only Mycenae has the right to take up arms. ‘But to have perished once is enough!’ Rather, to have sinned once would have been enough, provided that henceforth they utterly loathe well-nigh all womankind, these men to whom this trust in a sundering rampart, these delaying dykes—slight barriers against death—afford courage!
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] But did they not see Troy’s battlements, the work of Neptune’s hand, sink in flames? But you, my chosen troops, who is ready to hew down the rampart with the sword and rush with me on their terrified camp? I do not need the arms of Vulcan nor a thousand ships, to meet the Trojans. Let all Etruria join them at once in alliance. Darkness and cowardly theft [c dimgray]of their Palladium, with slaughter of guards on the citadel,[/c] they need not fear; nor shall we lurk in a horse’s dark belly: in broad day, in the sight of all, I mean to gird their walls with fire. I will see to it that they know they do not have to deal with Danaans and Pelasgic youths, whom Hector kept at bay till the tenth year. Now, since the better part of the day is spent, for what remains, men, joyfully refresh yourselves after your good service, and be assured that we are preparing for war.”

	with posted sentries, and to encircle the battlements with fires. Twice seven Rutulians are chosen to guard the walls with soldiers; on each attend a hundred men, purple-plumed and sparkling with gold. Back and forth they rush, and take their turns on watch, or, stretched along the grass, drink their fill of wine and upturn bowls of bronze. The fires burn bright, and the guards spend the sleepless night in games…
	[m1]\ [/m]
	On this scene the Trojans look forth from the rampart above, as in arms they hold the summit; in anxious haste they test the gates and build joining gangways
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] and bastions, bring up weapons. Mnestheus and valiant Serestus urge on the work, whom father Aeneas, should adversity ever require, appointed as leaders of the warriors and rulers of the state. Along the walls the whole host, sharing the peril, keeps watch, and serves in turns, each man at his allotted task.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Nisus was guardian of the gate, most valiant of warriors, son of Hyrtacus, whom Ida the huntress had sent in Aeneas’ train, quick with javelin and light arrows. At his side was Euryalus—none fairer was among the Aeneadae, or wore Trojan armour—a boy who showed on his unshaven cheek the first bloom of youth. A common love was theirs; side by side they would charge into battle; now too they were mounting sentry together at the gate. Nisus says: “Do the gods, Euryalus, put this fire into hearts, or does his own wild longing become to each man a god? Long has my heart been astir to dare battle or some great deed, and it is not content with peaceful quiet. You see what faith in their

Learn then what I ponder, and what purpose now rises in my mind. People and senate—all demand that Aeneas be summoned, and men be sent to bring him sure tidings. If they promise the boon I ask for you—for to me the glory of the deed is enough—I think that beneath that mound I can find a path to the walls and fortress of Pallanteum.” Euryalus was dazed, smitten with mighty love of praise, and at once speaks thus to his ardent friend: “Do you refuse then, Nisus, to let me join in this great endeavour? Am I to send you alone into such great perils? Not so did my father, the old warrior Opheltes, train me as his child among Argive terrors and the travails of Troy, nor at your side have I played my part so, following high-souled Aeneas and his ultimate fate. Mine is a heart that scorns the light, and believes that the glory that you strive for is cheaply bought with life.”

	Nisus replied: “Indeed, of you I had no such fear, no—it would be wrong; so may great Jupiter, or whoever looks on this deed with favouring eyes, bring me back to you in triumph! But if—as you see often in like hazards—if some god or chance sweepme to disaster, I want you to survive; your youth is worthier of life.

	Then said Aletes, stricken in years and sage in council: “Gods of our fathers, whose presence ever watches over Troy, despite all you do not intend utterly to blot out the Trojan race, since you have brought us such spirit in our youths and such unwavering souls.” So saying, he held them both by shoulder and hand, while tears rained down his cheeks and face. “What reward, men, shall I deem worthy to be paid you for deeds so glorious? The first and fairest the gods and your own hearts shall give; then the rest the good Aeneas will straightway repay, and the youthful Ascanius, never forgetful of service so noble.” “No,” breaks in Ascanius, “rather I, whose sole safety lies in my father’s return, adjure you both, Nisus, by the great gods of the house, by the Lar of Assaracus, and by hoary Vesta’s shrine—all my fortune, all my hope, I lay upon your knees; recall my father, give back the sight of him; if he is recovered all grief vanishes. A pair of goblets I will give, wrought in silver and rough with chasing, that he took when Arisba was vanquished; and two tripods, two great talents of gold, and an ancient bowl that Dido of Sidon gave. But if it is our lot to take Italy, to wield a victor’s sceptre and to assign the spoil, you have seen the horse that Turnus rode and the armour he wore, all gold—that same horse, the shield and the crimson plumes I will set apart from the lot, your reward, Nisus, even now. Moreover my father will give twelve matrons of choicest beauty, and men captives, each with his armour, and, beyond these, whatever land King

	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] But you, revered youth, whom my age follows more closely, at once I take all to my heart, and embrace as my comrade in every chance. No glory shall be sought for my own lot without you; whether in peace or war, you will have my greatest trust in deed and word.” To him spoke thus Euryalus in reply: “Never shall time prove me unfit for such bold deeds; only let Fortune prove kind, not cruel. But from you, above all your gifts, this one thing I ask. A mother I have, of Priam’s ancient line, whom neither the Ilian land nor King Acestes’ city could keep, unhappy woman, from leaving with me. I now leave her without knowledge of this peril, whatever it be, and without word of farewell, because—night and your right hand be witness—I could not bear a mother’s tears. But, I pray, comfort her in her helplessness and relieve her desolation. Let me take with me this hope of you; I will meet all hazards more boldly.” Touched to the heart, the Dardanians shed tears—fair Iülus more than all, and the picture of filial love touched his heart. Then he spoke thus . . .: “Assure yourself that all I do shall be worthy of your mighty enterprise; for she shall be a mother to me, lacking but the name Creüsa; no small honour awaits the bearing of such a son. Whatever chance attends your deed, I swear by this head, by which my father was wont to swear, what I promise to you on your prosperous return shall abide the same for your mother and your house.” So he speaks weeping; and at the same time strips from his shoulder the gilded

At once they advance in arms and as they go all the company of princes, young and old, escorts them to the gate with vows. Likewise fair Iülus, with a man’s mind and a spirit beyond his years, gave many a charge to carry to his father. But the breezes scatter all and give them fruitless to the clouds.

	They leave and cross the trenches, and through the shadow of night seek that fatal camp—yet destined first to be the doom of many. Everywhere they see bodies stretched along the grass in drunken sleep, chariots atilt on the shore, men lying among wheels and harness, their arms and flagons all about. First the son of Hyrtacus thus began: “Euryalus, now for a daring hand; now the occasion itself calls us; here lies our way. Watch that no arm be raised against us from behind, and keepwide outlook. Here I will deal destruction, and by a broad path show you the way.” So he speaks, then checks his voice, and at once drives his sword at haughty Rhamnes, who, it happened, pillowed on high coverlets, was breathing forth sleep from all his breast—a king himself, and King Turnus’ best-beloved augur; but not by augury could he avert his doom. Three attendants he slew at his side, as they lay carelessly among their arms, and Remus’ armour bearer, and the charioteer, catching him at the horses’ feet. Their drooping necks he severs with the sword; then lops off the head of their lord himself, and leaves the trunk spurting blood; ground and couch reek with the warm black gore. Lamyrus, too, he slays, and Lamus, and youthful Serranus, of wondrous

Just so, an unfed lion, rioting through full sheepfolds—for the madness of hunger constrains him—mangles and rends the feeble flock that is dumb with fear, and growls with blood-stained mouth. Nor less is the slaughter of Euryalus; he too, all aflame, rages, and falls on the vast unnamed multitude before him, Fadus and Herbesus, Rhoetus and Abaris, all unaware; but Rhoetus was awake and saw it all, yet in his fear crouched behind a mighty bowl. Right in his breast, as he rose, the foe in close encounter plunged his sword its full length, and drew it back steeped in death. Rhoetus belches forth his red life, and dying casts up wine mixed with blood; the other hotly pursues his stealthy work. And now he drew near Messapus’ followers. There he saw the last fires flickering, and horses, duly tethered, cropping the grass; when Nisus briefly speaks thus—for he saw his comrade swept away by reckless lust of carnage: “Let us away; for the unfriendly dawn is near. Vengeance is sated to the full; a path is cut through the foe.” Many a soldier’s arms, wrought in solid silver, they leave behind—and bowls as well, and beautiful carpets. Euryalus takes the trappings of Rhamnes and his gold-studded sword belt, gifts that long ago wealthy Caedicus sent to Remulus of Tibur, when plighting friend-shipfar away; he when dying gave them to his grandson for his own; after his death the Rutulians captured them in war and battle. These he tears away, and fits upon his valiant breast—all in vain. Then he dons Messapus’ shapely

	Meanwhile horsemen, sent forward from the Latin city, while the rest of the force halts drawn up on the plain, came bringing a reply to King Turnus—three hundred, all bearing shields, with Volcens as leader. And now they were nearing the camp and coming under the walls, when at a distance they see the two turning away by a pathway to the left; and in the glimmering shadows of night his helmet betrayed the thoughtless Euryalus, as it flashed back the light. Not in vain was it seen. From his column shouts Volcens: “Halt, men! What is the reason for your journey? Who are you in arms? And where are you going?” They offer no response, but speed their flight to the wood and trust to night. On this side and that the horsemen bar the well-known crossways, and with sentinels surround every outlet. The forest spread wide with thickets and dark ilex; dense briers filled it on every side; here and there the path glimmered through the hidden glades. Euryalus is hampered by the shadowy branches and the burden of his spoil, and fear misleads him in the line of the paths. Nisus gets clear; and now, in his heedless course, he had escaped the foe to the place later called Alban from Alba’s name (at that time King Latinus had there his stately stalls) when he halted and looked back in vain for his lost friend. “Un-happy Euryalus, where have I left you? Where shall I follow, again unthreading the whole tangled path of the treacherous wood?” At the same time he scans and retraces his footsteps, and wanders in the silent thickets. He

And the interval was not long, when a cry reaches his ears, and he sees Euryalus, whom, now betrayed by the ground and night and bewildered by the sudden turmoil, the whole band is dragging away overpowered and struggling violently in vain. What can he do? With what force, what arms dare he rescue the youth? Shall he cast himself on his doom among the swords and win with wounds a swift and glorious death? Quickly he draws back his arm with poised spear and, looking up to the moon on high, thus prays: “Goddess, be present and aid our endeavour, Latona’s daughter, glory of the stars and guardian of the groves; if ever my father Hyrtacus brought any gifts for me to your altars, if ever I have honoured you with any from my own hunting, have hung offerings in your dome, or fastened them on your holy roof,
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] grant me to confound that troop, and guide my weapons through the air.” He ended, and with all his straining body flung the steel. The flying spear whistles through the shadows of night, strikes the turned back of Sulmo, then snaps, and with the broken wood pierces the midriff. Spouting a warm torrent from his breast he rolls over chill in death, and long gasps heave his sides. Turning this way and that they gaze round. All the fiercer now he balances another weapon close to his ear. While they hesitate, the spear goes whizzing through both of Tagus’ temples, and lodged warm in the cloven brain. Volcens storms with rage, but nowhere espies the sender of the dart, nor where to vent his rage. “Yet you, mean­while,

	with your hot blood, will pay me vengeance for both,” he cried and, as he spoke, rushed with drawn sword on Euryalus. Then indeed, frantic with terror, Nisus shouts aloud; no longer could he hide himself in darkness or endure such agony: “On me—on me—here am I who did the deed—on me turn your steel, Rutulians! Mine is all the guilt; he neither dared nor could have done it; heaven be witness of this and the all-seeing stars! He but loved his hapless friend too well.” Thus was he pleading; but the sword, driven with force, passes through the ribs and rends the snowy breast. Euryalus rolls over in death; over his lovely limbs runs the blood, and his drooping neck sinks on his shoulder, as when a purple flower, severed by the plough, droops in death; or as poppies, with weary neck, bow the head, when weighted by a chance shower. But Nisus rushes among them, and among them all seeks only Volcens, to Volcens alone gives heed. Round him the foe cluster, and on every side try to hurl him back. Onward none the less he presses, whirling his lightning blade, till he plunged it full in the face of the shrieking Rutulian and, dying, bereft his foe of life. Then, pierced through and through, he flung himself on his lifeless friend, and there at length, in the peace of death, found rest.

Nor in that campwas the wailing less when Rhamnes was found drained of life, and so many chieftains slain in a single massacre, here Serranus, and here Numa. A mighty throng rushes to the dead and dying men, to the ground fresh with warm slaughter and streams foaming with copious blood. As they talk together, they recognize the spoils, Messapus’ shining helmet, and the trappings won back with much sweat.

	And now early Dawn, leaving the saffron bed of Tithonus, was sprinkling her fresh rays upon the earth; now that the sun streamed in, now that day unveiled the world, Turnus, himself in armour clad, summons his men to arms; the leaders marshal the mailed lines to battle, each his own men, and whet their anger with divers tales. On uplifted spears (piteous sight!) they affix and follow with loud clamour the heads, the very heads, of Euryalus and Nisus. …Ontherampart’s left side—for the right is girded by the river—the hardy sons of Aeneas have set their opposing line, hold the broad trenches, and on the high towers stand sorrowing, moved by those uplifted heads that they know too well, now dripping with dark gore.

You who were the last solace of my age, could you bring yourself to leave me alone, cruel one? And when you were sent on so perilous an errand, did you not give your poor mother a chance to bid you a last farewell? Alas! You lie in a strange land, given as prey to the dogs and fowls of Latium! Nor did I, your mother, escort you to the grave, or close your eyes, or bathe your wounds, shrouding you with the robe which, in haste, night and day, I toiled at for your sake, beguiling with the loom the sorrows of age.
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] Where am I to follow? What land now holds your mangled limbs and dismembered body? Is this all, my son, you bring back to me of yourself?

	Some seek an entrance, and try to scale the walls with ladders, where the line is thin and light gleams through a less dense ring of men. In return, the Teucrians hurl missiles of every sort, and thrust the foe down with strong poles, trained by long warfare to defend their walls. Stones too they rolled of deadly weight, in the hope of breaking through the sheltered ranks: but beneath their compact shield, the enemy delight to brave all dangers. But now they fail; for where a massed throng threatens, the Teucrians roll up and hurl down a mighty mass, that laid low the Rutulians far and wide and broke their coverlet of armour. And the bold Rutulians care no longer to contend in blind warfare, but strive with darts to clear the ramparts.… Elsewhere, grim to behold, Mezentius was brandishing his Etruscan pine and hurls smoking brands; while Messapus, the seed of Neptune, tamer of horses, tears down the rampart and calls for ladders to mount the battlements.

While they huddle close and retreat to the side free from ruin, under the sudden weight the tower fell, and all the sky thunders with the crash. Half dead they fall to the ground, the monstrous mass behind them, pierced by their own weapons, and their breasts impaled by cruel splinters. Only Helenor and Lycus barely escape—Helenor in the prime of youth, whom a Licymnian slave had borne secretly to the Maeonian king, and had sent to Troy in forbidden arms, lightly accoutred with naked sword and white shield, as yet unfamed.

But Lycus, far swifter of foot, among foes, among weapons, gains the walls and strives to clutch the coping, and reach the hands of his comrades. Turnus, following him with both foot and spear, taunts thus in triumph: “Fool, did you hope to escape our hands?” At the same time he seizes him as he hangs, and tears him down with a mighty mass of wall: just as when the bearer of Jove’s bolt, as he soars aloft, has swept up in his crooked talons a hare or snowy-bodied swan; or as when the wolf of Mars

So the arrow winged its way and lodged deepin his left side; burying itself inside, it tore the breathing ways of life with fatal wound. The son of Arcens stood in glorious arms, his mantle embroidered with the needle, and bright with Iberian blue—of noble form, whom his father Arcens had sent, a youth reared in his mother’s grove by the streams of Symaethus, where Palicus’ altar stands, gift-laden and gracious.

A race of hardy stock, we first bring our newborn sons to the river, and harden them with the water’s cruel cold; as boys they keepvigil for the chase, and tire the forests; their sport is to rein the steed and shoot arrows from the bow; but patient of toil, and inured to want, our youth tames earth with the hoe or shakes cities in battle. All our life is worn down with iron’s use; with spear reversed we goad our bullocks’ flanks, and sluggish age does not weaken our hearts’ strength or change our vigour. On to white hairs we press the helmet, and we ever delight to drive in fresh booty and live on plunder. But you wear embroidered saffron and gleaming purple; sloth is your joy, your delight is to enjoy the dance; your tunics have sleeves and your turbans ribbons.

My own hand shall bring you yearly gifts in your temple, and set before your altar a bullock with gilded brow, snowy white, carrying his head as high as his mother, that already can butt with his horn and can spurn the sand with his hoof.” The Father heard, and from a clear space of sky thundered on the left; at that moment the fatal bow twanged. With awful whirr speeds forth the tight-drawn shaft, passes through the head of Remulus, and cleaves the hollow temples with its steel. “Go, mock valour with haughty words! This is the answer that the twice captured Phrygians send back to the Rutulians.” Ascanius said no more. The Teucrians second him with cheers, they shout for joy, and raise their spirits to the skies.

	Then it chanced that in the realm of sky long-haired Apollo, cloud-enthroned, was looking down on the Ausonian lines and town, and thus he addresses triumphant Iülus: “A blessing, boy, on your young valour! So man scales the stars, you son of gods and sire of gods to be!
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] All the wars that fate may bring will justly cease under the house of Assaracus; nor can Troy contain you.” So saying, he darts from high heaven, parts the breathing gales, and seeks Ascanius. Then he changes the fashion of his features to those of aged Butes, who in time gone by was armour bearer to Dardan Anchises, and trusty watcher at

On strode Apollo, in all things like the old man, in voice and hue, in white locks and savage-sounding arms, and speaks these words to fiery Iülus: “Let it be enough, son of Aeneas, that beneath your shafts Numanus has fallen unavenged; this first taste of glory great Apollo vouchsafes you, and does not grudge the weapons that match his own; for the rest, child, refrain from war.” Thus Apollo began but, while yet speaking , left the sight of men and far away from their eyes vanished into thin air. The Dardan princes knew the god and his heavenly arms, and heard his quiver rattle as he flew. Therefore, at the behest and will of Phoebus, they check Ascanius, eager though he is for the fray, they themselves go back into the fight and fling their lives into open dangers. The shout runs from tower to tower, all along the walls; they bend their eager bows and whirl their thongs.
	[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c] All the ground is strewn with spears; shields and hollow helms ring as they clash; the fight swells fierce: mighty as the storm that, coming from the west, beneath the rainy Kids lashes the ground; thick as the hail that storm clouds shower on the deep, when Jupiter, grim with southern gales, whirls the watery tempest, and bursts the hollow clouds in heaven.

The Rutulians rush in when they see the entrance clear. Straightway Quercens and Aquicolus, beautiful in arms, and Tmarus, reckless at heart, and Haemon, seed of Mars, with all their columns are routed and turn to flight, or in the very gateway lay down their life. At this, wrath waxes fiercer in their battling souls, and now the Trojans rally and swarm to the spot, and venture to close hand to hand and to sally farther out.

	To Turnus the chief, as far away he storms and confounds his foe, comes news that the enemy, flushed with fresh slaughter, is flinging wide his gates. He quits the work in hand and, stirred with giant fury, rushes to the Dardan gate and the proud brothers. And first Antiphates (for he was first to advance), the bastard son of tall Sarpedon by a Theban mother, he slays with a javelin cast. Through the yielding air flies the Italian cornel shaft and, lodging in the gullet, runs deep into the breast; the wound’s dark chasm gives back a foaming tide, and the steel grows warm in the pierced lung. Then Meropes and Erymas, then Aphidnus his hand lays low; then Bitias falls, fire in his eyes and rage in his heart, not under a javelin—for to a javelin he would not have given his life—but with a mighty hiss a whirled pike sped, driven like a thunderbolt. Not two bulls’ hides nor the trusty corslet with double scales of gold could withstand it. The giant limbs totter and

	At this Mars, the mighty in war, lent fresh strength and valour to the Latins, and in their hearts plied his keen goads, and let slip Flight and dark Terror among the Teucrians. From all sides gather the Latins, since scope for fight is given, and the god of battle seizes on their souls. Pandarus, when he sees his brother’s fallen form, sees how fortune stands, and what chance sways the day, with mighty effort pushes with his broad shoulders and swings the gate round on its hinge, leaving many a comrade shut outside the walls in the cruel fray; but others he encloses with himself, welcoming them as they rush in. Madman! not to have seen the Rutulian prince bursting in among the throng, and wantonly to have shut him upin the town, like a monstrous tiger among helpless herds. Straightway a new light flashed from Turnus’ eyes and his armour rang terribly; the blood-red plumes quiver on his crest, and lightnings shoot gleaming from his shield. In sudden dismay the sons of Aeneas recognize that hateful form and those giant limbs. Then huge Pandarus springs forward and, blazing with wrath for his brother’s death, cries: “This

This is a foeman’s camp that you see; there is no chance to escape from here.” To him said Turnus, smiling in untroubled mood: “Begin, if your heart has any courage, and close with me: you will tell Priam that here too an Achilles has been found.” He ended; the other, striving with all his might, hurls his spear, rough with knots and unpeeled bark. The winds received it; Saturnian Juno turned aside the coming blow, and the spear lodges in the gate. “But you will not escape from this weapon that my right arm brandishes; for not such is the wielder of weapon and wound.” So saying, he rises high with his uplifted sword; the steel cleaves the brow in two right between the temples, and with ghastly wound severs the beardless cheeks. There is a crash, earth is shaken by the vast weight; dying, he stretches on the ground his fainting limbs and brain-bespattered armour, while in equal halves his head dangles this way and that from either shoulder.

	the fray, Alcander and Halius, Noemon and Prytanis. As Lynceus moves to meet him and calls on his comrades he, from the rampart on the right, with sweep of flashing sword, smites him; severed by a single blow at close quarters, his head with its helmet lay far away. Next fell Amycus, scourge of beasts, whom none excelled in skill of hand in anointing the dart and arming the steel with venom; and Clytius, son of Aeolus, and Cretheus, delight of the Muses—Cretheus, the Muses’ comrade, whose joy was ever in song and lyre and in stringing notes upon the chords; ever he sang of steeds and weapons, of men and battles.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At last, hearing of the slaughter of their men, the Teucrian captains, Mnestheus and gallant Serestus, come up, and see their comrades scattered and the foe within the gates. And Mnestheus: “Where then, where are you going? What other walls, what other battlements do you have elsewhere? My countrymen, shall one man, hemmed in on every side by your ramparts, deal such carnage throughout the city and go unpunished? Shall he send down to death so many of our noblest youths? Cowards, have you no pity, no shame, for your unhappy country, for your ancient gods, for great Aeneas?”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Kindled by such words, they take heart and halt in dense array. Stepby stepTurnus withdraws from the fight, making for the river and the place encircled by the stream. All the more fearlessly the Teucrians press on him with loud shouts and mass their ranks—as when a crowd with levelled spears beset a savage lion: but he, affrighted, yet fierce and glaring angrily, gives ground, and neither

	wrath nor courage lets him turn his back, nor yet, desirous though he be, can he make his way through hunters and through spears. Just so Turnus in doubt retraces his unhurried steps, his heart seething with rage. Indeed, even then twice he attacked the foe, twice he drove them in flying rout along the walls: but the whole host hastily gathers in a body from the camp, and Saturnian Juno did not dare grant him strength to oppose them, for Jupiter sent Iris down through the sky from Heaven, charged with no gentle behests for his sister,
	[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c] should Turnus not leave the Teucrians’ lofty ramparts. Therefore, with neither shield nor sword arm can the soldier hold his own: with such a hail of missiles is he overwhelmed on all sides. Round his hollow temples the helmet echoes with ceaseless clash; the solid brass gapes beneath the rain of stones; the horsehair crest is torn from his head, and the shield’s boss withstands not the blows: the Trojans and Mnestheus himself, of lightning force, launch a storm of spears. Then all over his body flows the sweat and runs in pitchy stream, and he has no breathing space; a sickly panting shakes his wearied limbs. Then at length, with headlong leap, he plunges in full armour into the river. Tiber with his yellow flood received him as he came, lifted him up on buoyant waters and, washing away the carnage, returned the joyous hero to his comrades.

	Meanwhile the palace of omnipotent Olympus is thrown open, and the Sire of gods and King of men calls a council to his starry dwelling, from where, high-throned, he surveys all lands, the Dardan camp, and the Latin peoples. In the double-doored hall
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] they take their seats, and the king begins: “Mighty sons of Heaven, why is your decision reversed, and why do you quarrel with hearts so discordant? I forbade Italy to clash in war with Troy. What feud is this, in face of my command? What terror has bidden these or those to rush to arms and provoke the sword? There shall come—do not hasten it—a lawful time for battle, when fierce Carthage shall one day let loose upon the heights of Rome mighty destruction, and open upon her the Alps.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] Then it will be lawful to vie in hate, then to ravage; now let be and cheerfully assent to the covenant I ordain.”

No longer do barred walls shelter the Teucrians; rather, inside the gates and even on the rampart walls they join battle, and the trenches are flooded with blood. Aeneas, unknowing, is far away. Will you never suffer the siege to be raised? Once more a foe, a second army, threatens the walls of infant Troy; and once more against the Trojans there rises from Aetolian Arpi a son of Tydeus.

Bid Carthage with mighty sway crush Ausonia; from Ausonia shall come no hindrance to Tyrian towns.

Since it may not be that Ausonians and Teucrians join alliance, and your disunion admits no end, whatever the fortune of each today, whatever the hope each pursues, be he Trojan or be he Rutulian, no distinction shall I make, whether it be Italy’s fortune that holds the camp in siege, or Troy’s baneful error and misleading prophecies. Nor do I exempt the Rutulians. Each one’s own course shall bring him his suffering or success. Jupiter is king over all alike; the fates shall find their way.” By the waters of his Stygian brother, by the banks that seethe with pitch and black swirling waters, he nodded assent, and with the nod made all Olympus tremble. So ended the parley. Then from his golden throne Jupiter rises, and the celestial company gather round and escort him to the threshold.

	Meanwhile, around every gate the Rutulians press on, to slaughter the foe with the sword, and to gird the ramparts with flame. But the army of the Aeneadae is held pent up inside the palisades, and there is no hope of escape. Forlorn and helpless they stand on the high towers, and girdle the walls with scanty ring. Asius, son of Imbrasus, and Thymoetes, son of Hicetaon, and the two Assaraci, and Castor, and old Thymbris are the foremost rank; at their side are Sarpedon’s two brothers, Clarus and Thaemon, come from lofty Lycia. One, straining his whole frame, lifts up a giant rock, no scant fragment of a mountain—Acmon of Lyrnesus, huge as his father Clytius or his brother Mnestheus. Some with darts and some with stones, they strive to ward off the foe, and hurl fire and fit arrows to the string. In their midst, the Dardan boy himself, Venus’ most rightful care, his comely head uncovered, glitters like a jewel inset in yellow gold to adorn neck or

You too, Ismarus, your high-souled clansmen saw aiming wounds and arming shafts with venom, you noble scion of a Lydian house, where men till rich fields and Pactolus waters them with gold. There too was Mnestheus, whom yesterday’s triumph of thrusting Turnus from the rampart walls exalts to the stars; and Capys, from whom comes the name of the Campanian city.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Thus they had clashed in stubborn warfare’s conflict: and Aeneas at midnight was cleaving the seas. For when, leaving Evander and entering the Tuscan camp, he meets the king, and to the king announces his name and his race, the aid he seeks, and the aid he himself offers; informs him of the forces Mezentius is gathering to his side, and the violence of Turnus’ spirit; then warns him, what faith may be put in things human, and with pleas mingles entreaties—without delay Tarchon joins forces and strikes a treaty; then, freed from Fate,
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] the Lydian people embark under heaven’s ordinance, entrusting themselves to a foreign leader. Aeneas’ shiptakes the lead with Phrygian lions beneath her beak; above them towers Ida, sight most welcome to Trojan exiles.
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] There sits great Aeneas, pondering the changing issues of war; and Pallas, staying close to his left side, asks him now about the stars, their guide through the dark night, and now of his trials by land and sea.

	At their head Massicus cleaves the waters in the bronze-plated Tiger; under him is a band of a thousand youths, who have left the walls of Clusium and the city of Cosae; their weapons are arrows, light quivers on the shoulders, and deadly bows. With him is grim Abas, all his train in dazzling armour, his vessel gleaming with a gilded Apollo. To him Populonia had given six hundred of her sons, all skilled in war, and Ilva three hundred—an island rich in the Chalybes’ inexhaustible mines.
	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] Third comes Asilas, famous interpreter between gods and men, whom the victims’ entrails obey, and the stars of heaven, the tongues of birds, and prophetic lightning fires. A thousand men he hurries to war in serried array and bristling with spears. These Pisa bids obey him—city of Alphean birth, but set in Tuscan soil. Then follows Astur, of wondrous beauty—Astur, relying on his mount and many-coloured weapons. Three hundred more—all of one mind to follow—come from the men who have their home in Caere and in the plains of Minio, in ancient Pyrgi, and fever-stricken Graviscae.

	Nor would I pass you by, Cunerus, bravest in war of Ligurian captains, or you, Cupavo, with your scanty train, from whose crest rise the swan plumes—a reproach, Cupid, to you and yours

	For they tell that Cycnus, in grief for his loved Phaëthon, while he is singing and with music solacing his woeful love amid the shade of his sisters’ leafy poplars, drew over his form the soft plumage of white old age, leaving earth and seeking the stars with his cry. His son, following on shipboard with a band of like age, drives with oars the mighty Centaur; over the water towers the monster, and threatens to hurl a mighty rock into the waves from above, while with long keel he furrows the deep seas.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Ocnus, too, summons a host from his native shores, son of prophetic Manto and the Tuscan river, who gave you, Mantua, ramparts and his mother’s name—Mantua, rich in ancestry, yet not all of one stock: three races are there, and under each race four peoples:
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] herself the head of the peoples, her strength from Tuscan blood. Hence, too, Mezentius arms five hundred against himself,
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] whom Mincius, child of Benacus, crowned with gray sedge, leads over the seas in their hostile ships of pine. On comes Aulestes heavily, lashing the waves as he rises to the stroke of a hundred oars; the waters foam as the surface is torn up. He sails in the huge Triton, whose shell alarms the blue billows: its shaggy front, as it floats, shows a man down to the waist, its belly ends in a fish; beneath the monster’s breast the wave gurgles in foam. So many the chosen chiefs who sailed in thrice ten ships to the help of Troy, and cut the salty plains with bronze beak.

And lo! in mid course a band of his own company meets him, for the nymphs whom gracious Cybele had ordered to be deities of the sea, and turn from ships to nymphs, came swimming abreast and cleaving the billows, as many as the bronze prows that once lay moored to shore. They recognize their king from afar, and encircle him with their dancing. From among them, Cymodocea, most skilled in speech, following behind, grasps the stern with her right hand, and herself rises breast high above the wave, while with her left hand she oars her way upon the silent waters. Then thus she addresses the prince, all unaware: “Are you awake, Aeneas, scion of gods? Wake and fling loose the sheets of your sails. We—pines of Ida, from her sacred crest, now nymphs of the sea—are your fleet! When the treacherous Rutulian was driving us headlong with fire and sword, we reluctantly broke your moorings and are seeking you over the waves. This new shape the Great Mother gave us in pity, and granted us to be goddesses and spend our life beneath the waves. But your son Ascanius is hemmed in by wall and trench, in the midst of arms and of Latins bristling with war. Already the Arcadian cavalry, joined with brave Etruscans, hold the appointed place; to bar their way with interposing squadrons, lest they approach the camp, is Turnus’ fixed resolve. Up, then, and with the coming dawn first give orders that your friends be called to arms, and take invincible the shield which the Lord of Fire himself gave you and rimmed with gold. Tomorrow’s light, if you do not consider my words idle, shall look on mighty heaps of Rutulian carnage.” She

Marvelling, the Trojan son of Anchises is amazed, but cheers his soul with the omen. Then, looking at the vault above, he briefly prays: “Gracious lady of Ida, mother of the gods, to whom Dindymus is dear, and tower-crowned cities, and lions harnessed to your reins, be now my leader in the fight, duly prosper the omen, and attend your Phrygians, goddess, with favouring step!” So much he said; and meanwhile the returning day was rushing on with fulness of light, and had chased away the night. First he commands his comrades to follow his signals, ready their hearts for combat and fit themselves for the fray.

	And now, as he stands on the high stern, he had the Trojans and his campin view, when at once he lifted high in his left hand his blazing shield.

	But fearless Turnus did not lose his firm hope of seizing the shore first, and driving the approaching foe from land. [c dimgray]Nay, he raises their courage with his words—nay, he chides them[/c]: “What you have desired in your prayers is now possible—to break through with the sword! The war god’s self is in your hands, men. Now let each be mindful of his wife and home; now recall the great deeds, the glories of our sires! Let us meet them at the water’s edge, while they are confused and their feet falter as first they land. Fortune aids the daring . . .” So saying, he ponders with himself whom to lead to the attack, and to whom he can entrust the beleaguered walls.

	Meanwhile Aeneas lands his crews from the tall ships by gangways. Many watch for the ebb of the spent sea, and boldly leap into the shallows; others use oars. Tarchon, marking the shore where the shallows do not heave and the broken billow does not roar, but the sea glides up un-checked with spreading flow, suddenly turns his prow thither and implores his men: “Now, chosen band, bend to your stout oars! Raise, drive on your ships; cleave with your beaks this hostile shore, and let the keel herself plough a furrow. I do not shrink from shipwreck in such an anchorage, when once I win the land.” When Tarchon has thus spoken, his comrades rise to their oars, and drive their foaming ships upon the Latin fields, till the beaks gain the dry land and every hull comes to rest unscathed. But not

	Nor does dull delay hold Turnus back, but swiftly he sweeps his whole army at the Trojans, and plants it against them on the shore. The trumpets sound. First Aeneas dashed on the rustic ranks—fair omen for the fight—and laid low the Latins, slaying Theron, who in his might dared assail the hero Aeneas. Driven through the seams of bronze and through the tunic rough with gold, the sword drank from his pierced side. Next he strikes Lichas, who was cut from his dead mother’s womb, and consecrated to you, Phoebus: but why was he suffered at birth to escape the peril of steel? Soon after, he cast down to death sturdy Cisseus and giant Gyas, as with clubs they laid low the ranks: the arms of Hercules did not help them, nor their stout hands and their father Melampus, Alcides’ comrade all the time that earth yielded him grievous travails. Lo! as Pharus flings forth idle words, Aeneas launches his javelin and plants it in his bawling mouth. You too, hapless Cydon, while you follow your new delight, Clytius, whose cheeks are golden with early down—you would have fallen under the Dardan hand and lain, a piteous sight, forgetful of all your youthful loves, had not the serried band of your brothers met the foe—children of Phorcus, seven in number, and seven the darts they throw.

	they but grazed the body. Thus Aeneas speaks to loyal Achates: “Bring me plenty of weapons; my hand will hurl none at Rutulians in vain, of all that once on Ilium’s plains were lodged in the bodies of Greeks.” Then he seizes a great spear and hurls it; flying, it crashes through the brass of Maeon’s shield, rending corslet and breast at once. His brother Alcanor comes to his aid, and with his right arm upholds his falling brother; piercing the arm, the spear flies right onward, keeping its bloody course, and the dying arm hung by the sinews from the shoulder. Then Numitor, tearing the lance from his brother’s body, aimed at Aeneas, but he could not strike him in return, but grazed the thigh of great Achates.

	Now comes up Clausus from Cures, trusting in his youthful frame, and from a distance smites Dryops under the chin with his stiff shaft driven with force, and piercing his throat robs him, as he speaks, of voice and life together; Dryops smites the ground with his forehead, and from his mouth vomits thick blood. Three Thracians, too, of the exalted race of Boreas, and three whom their father Idas and their native Ismarus sent forth, he lays low in divers ways. Halaesus runs to his side, and the Auruncan bands; the scion, too, of Neptune comes up, Messapus glorious with his steeds. Now these, now those, strain to thrust back the foe; on Ausonia’s very threshold is the struggle. As in wide heaven warring winds rise to battle, matched in spirit and strength; they yield not to one another—not winds, not clouds, not sea; long is the battle doubtful; all things stand locked in struggle; just so clash the ranks of Troy and the ranks of Latium, foot against foot, and man pressed close against man.

	boulders far and wide and bushes torn from the banks, when Pallas saw his Arcadians, unused to charge on foot, turn to flight before pursuing Latium—for the nature of the ground, roughened by waters, persuaded them for once to dismiss their horses—then, as the one hope in such straits, now with entreaties, now with bitter words, he fires their courage: “Friends, where are you running? By your brave deeds I pray you, by your King Evander’s name, by the wars you have won, by my hopes now springing up to match my father’s renown—trust not to flight. We must hew a way through the foe with the sword. Where the mass of men presses thickest, there your noble country calls you back, with Pallas at your head. No gods press upon us; by mortal foes are we mortals driven; we have as many lives, as many hands as they. See, the ocean hems us in with mighty barrier of sea; there is now no land for our flight; are we to make for the sea or Troy?” He speaks these words and dashes on into the midst of the serried foe.

	First Lagus meets him, drawn there by unkind fate; him, while tearing at a stone of vast weight, he pierces with hurled javelin where the spine midway between the ribs made a parting, and plucks back the spear from its lodging in the bones. Nor does Hisbo surprise him by falling on him from above, hopeful though he is; for Pallas, as he rushes on, reckless and enraged over his comrade’s cruel death, has welcome ready and buries his sword in his distended chest.

But now Pallas has made a grim difference between you. For your head, Thymber, Evander’s sword swept off; while your severed hand, Larides, seeks its master, and the dying fingers twitch and clutch again at the sword. Fired by his chiding and beholding his glorious deeds, the Arcadians are armed by mingled wrath and shame to face the foe.

	Then Pallas pierces Rhoeteus, as he flies past in his chariot. So much respite, so much delay Ilus gained; for at Ilus he had launched from afar his strong spear, and Rhoeteus intercepts it midway, fleeing from you, noble Teuthras, and from Tyres your brother. Rolling from the car in death, he spurns with his heels the Rutulian fields. And as in summer, when the winds he longed for have risen, some shepherd kindles fires here and there among the woods; suddenly the spaces between catch fire, and Vulcan’s bristling battleline spreads unbroken over the broad fields; he, from his seat, gazes down victorious on the revelling flames: just so all your comrades’ chivalry rallies to one point in aid of you, Pallas! But Halaesus, bold in war, advances to confront them, and gathers himself behind his shield. He slays Ladon, and Pheres, and Demodocus; with gleaming sword he lops off Strymonius’ hand, raised against his throat; then smites Thoas in the face with a stone, and scattered the bones, mingled with blood and brains. His sire, prophetic of fate, had hidden Halaesus in the woods: when, with advance of age, he relaxed his glazing eyes in death, the Fates laid hand on Helaesus and devoted him to Evander’s darts.

	But Lausus, a mighty portion of the war, does not allow his ranks to be dismayed by the hero’s vast carnage: first he cuts down Abas, who faces him, the battle’s knot
	[c dimgray][sup]16[/sup][/c] and barrier. Then falls the youth of Arcadia, the Etruscans fall, and you Trojans, whose bodies the Greeks did not destroy. The armies close, matched in captains as in might; the rearmost crowd upon the van, and the throng does not allow weapons or hands to move. Here Pallas presses and strains; there Lausus confronts him; the two were nearly matched in years, and peerless in beauty, but to them fortune had denied return to their homeland. But the king of great Olympus did not permit them to meet face to face; each has his own fate awaiting him soon beneath a greater foe.

	Meanwhile his gracious sister warns Turnus to go to Lausus’ aid, and with his swift chariot he cleaves the ranks between. As he saw his comrades, he cried: “It is time to stand aside from battle; I alone attack Pallas; to me alone Pallas is due; I wish that his father himself were here to see!” He said this, and his comrades withdrew from the field at his bidding. But when the Rutulians retired, then the youth, marvelling at the haughty command, stands amazed at Turnus, throws his eyes over that giant frame,

	and with fierce glance scans all from afar, then with these words answers the monarch’s words: “Soon I shall win praise either for kingly spoils or for a glorious death; my sire is equal to either fate: away with your threats!” So saying, he advances to the middle of the field: cold blood gathers at the hearts of the Arcadians. Down from his chariot leapt Turnus; he makes ready to close with the other on foot. And as, when from some lofty outlook a lion has seen a bull stand far off on the plain, meditating battle, on he rushes, no different seemed the coming of Turnus. But Pallas, when he thought his foe within range of a spear-cast, moved forward first, in the hope that chance would aid the venture of his ill-matched strength, and thus to great heaven he cries: “By my father’s welcome, and the table to which you came as a stranger, I beseech you, Alcides, aid my great enterprise. May Turnus see me strip the bloody arms from his dying limbs, and may his glazing eyes endure a conqueror!” Alcides heard the youth, and deep in his heart stifled a heavy groan, and shed useless tears. Then with kindly words the Father addresses his son:
	[c dimgray][sup]17[/sup][/c] “Each has his day appointed; short and irretrievable is the span of life for all: but to lengthen fame by deeds—that is valour’s task. Under Troy’s high walls fell those many sons of gods; indeed, with them fell my own child Sarpedon.
	[c dimgray][sup]18[/sup][/c] For Turnus too his own fate calls, and he has reached the goal of his allotted years.” So he speaks, and turns his eyes away from the Rutulian fields.

	the shaft and strikes where the top of the mail rises to guard the shoulder; then, forcing a way through the shield’s rim, at last even grazed the mighty frame of Turnus. At this, Turnus, long poising his oaken shaft tipped with sharpsteel, hurls it against Pallas, speaking thus: “See whether my weapon is not sharper!” He had spoken; and with quivering stroke the point tears through the centre of the shield, with all its plates of iron, all its plates of bronze, all the bull hide’s overlaying folds; then pierces the corslet’s barrier and the mighty breast. In vain he plucks the warm dart from the wound; by one and the same road follow blood and life. He falls prone upon the wound, his armour clashes over him, and, dying, he smites the hostile earth with blood-stained mouth. Then standing over him Turnus cries: “Arcadians, give heed, and bear these words of mine back to Evander: I send him back Pallas as he has deserved to receive him.
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] Whatever honour a tomb gives, whatever solace a burial, I freely grant; but his welcome of Aeneas shall cost him dear.” So saying, with his left foot he trod upon the dead man, tearing away the belt’s huge weight and the story of the crime engraved on it
	[c dimgray][sup]20[/sup][/c]—the youthful band foully slain on one nuptial night, and the chambers drenched with blood—which Clonus, son of Eurytus, had richly chased in gold.

But with many moans and tears his friends throng round Pallas and bear him back lying on his shield. O you who will go home as a great grief and yet great glory to your father, this day first gave you to war, this also takes you from it, the day when yet you leave behind vast piles of Rutulian dead!

	And now no mere rumour of the bitter blow but a surer messenger flies to Aeneas—that his men are but a hair’s breadth removed from death, that it is time to succour the routed Teucrians. With the sword he mows down all the nearest ranks, and fiercely drives a broad path through the host with the steel, seeking you, Turnus, still flushed with fresh slaughter. Pallas, Evander, everything is before his eyes—the board to which he came then, a stranger, and the right hands pledged. Then four youths, sons of Sulmo, and as many reared by Ufens, he takes alive, to offer as victims to the dead and to sprinkle the funeral flame with captive blood. Next at Magus from a distance he had aimed the hostile lance. Deftly he cowers—the lance flies quivering over him—and, clasping the hero’s knees, he speaks thus in supplication: “By the spirit of your father, by your hope in growing Iülus, I entreat you, save my life for a son and for a father. I have a lofty house; buried deep inside lie talents of chased silver, and I have masses of gold, wrought and unwrought. Not on me does the victory of Troy turn, nor will one life make a difference so great.” He spoke, and Aeneas thus replied: “Those many talents of silver and gold that you tell of, keepthem for your sons.

	Pallas was slain. Thus judges my father Anchises’ spirit, thus Iülus.” So speaking, he grasps the helmet with his left hand and, bending back the suppliant’s neck, drives the sword in upto the hilt. Close by was Haemon’s son, priest of Phoebus and Trivia, his temples wreathed in the fillet’s sacred band, all glittering in his white robe and armour. Him Aeneas meets and drives over the plain; then, bestriding the fallen man, slaughters him and wraps him in mighty darkness; his armour Serestus gathers and carries away on his shoulders, a trophy, King Gradivus, for you!

His sword had felled Anxur’s left arm to the ground with the whole circle of his shield—he had uttered some brave vaunt and thought his hand would match his word, and perhaps he was raising his spirit and had promised himself white-haired old age and length of years—when, in the pride of gleaming arms, Tarquitus, whom the Nymph Dryope had borne to silvan Faunus, crossed his fiery course. Drawing back his spear, he pins the corslet and the shield’s huge burden together; then, as the youth vainly pleaded and tried to say many a word, he strikes his head to the ground and, as he spurns the trunk, still warm, speaks these words over him from his pitiless heart: “Lie there now, terrible man! No loving mother shall lay you in the earth, nor weigh down your limbs with an ancestral tomb. You will be left for the birds of prey; or, sunk beneath the flood, the wave will carry you along, and hungry fish will lick your wounds.” Next he overtakes Antaeus and Lucas, foremost of Turnus’ ranks, and brave Numa,

Like Aegaeon, who, men say, had a hundred arms and a hundred hands, and flashed fire from fifty mouths and breasts, when against Jove’s thunders he clanged with as many like shields, and bared as many swords;
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] so Aeneas over the whole plain gluts his victorious rage, when once his sword grew warm. Now see! he makes for Niphaeus’ four-horse chariot and the chests that faced him; when they saw his long strides and deadly rage, in terror they turn and rush backward, flinging forth their master and dragging the chariot to the shore.

	Meanwhile, with their two white steeds, Lucagus and Liger his brother dash into the fray; but the brother guides the horses with the reins, while Lucagus fiercely brandishes his drawn sword.

To him Liger…: “It is not Diomedes’ horses that you see, nor Achilles’ car, nor the plains of Phrygia; now you will find an end of your warfare and your life in this land.” Such words fly abroad from mad Liger’s lips. But not in words does the Trojan hero shape a reply, for he hurls his javelin against the foe. Then, as Lucagus, leaning forward to the stroke, urged on his steeds with the sword, while with left foot advanced he prepares for the fray, the spear comes through the lowest rim of his gleaming shield, then pierces the left groin; tumbling from the chariot, he rolls dying on the ground while loyal Aeneas addresses him with bitter words: “Lucagus, it is not a cowardly flight by your horses that betrayed your chariot;

	and it is not the empty shadow from a foe that has turned them back; it is you yourself, leaping from the wheels, who forsakes your beasts.” So saying, he seized the horses; as he slid down from the same chariot, his brother piteously outstretched his helpless hands: “By yourself, by the parents who gave life to such a son, hero of Troy, spare this life, and have pity on my prayer!” As he continued to plead, Aeneas said: “Not such were your words before. Die, and let not brother forsake brother!” Then with the sword he cleft open his breast, where life lies hidden. Such were the deaths the Dardan chieftain wrought over the plains, raging like a brook in torrent or a black tempest. At last the boy Ascanius and the warriors besieged in vain break out and leave the camp.

	Meanwhile Jupiter of his own will addresses Juno: “O you who are both sister and dearest wife to me, it is Venus, as you supposed—your judgment is not wrong—who upholds the Trojan power, not their own right hands quick for war and their proud souls patient of peril.” To him Juno speaks meekly: “Why, my fairest lord, do you vex my sick heart, that fears your stern commands? Had my love the force that once it had, and still should have, this boon surely you would not deny me—the power to withdraw Turnus from the fray, and preserve him in safety for his father Daunus. But now let him perish and with innocent blood make atonement to the Trojans! Yet from our lineage he derives his name, for Pilumnus was his sire four generations gone; and often he has heaped your threshold with many a gift from a lavish hand.” To her the king of heavenly Olympus thus briefly spoke: “If your prayer is for a respite

	from present death, and a reprieve for the doomed youth—if you understand that such is my will, take Turnus away in flight, and snatch him from impending fate. Thus far there is room for indulgence. But if thought of deeper favour lurks beneath your prayers, and you think that the war’s whole course may be moved or altered, you are nursing an idle hope.” And Juno weeping: “What if your heart were to grant what your tongue begrudges, and this life I crave were to remain assured to Turnus? Now a heavy doom awaits him for no guilt, or I wander empty of truth. O may I rather be mocked by my lying fears, and you, who can, bend your purposes to a better end!”

	When she had spoken these words, she darted at once from high heaven through the air, driving her storm chariot and girdled in cloud, and sought the army of Ilium and the camp of Laurentum. Then the goddess from hollow mist fashions a thin, strengthless phantom in the likeness of Aeneas, a monstrous marvel to behold, decks it with Dardan weapons, and counterfeits the shield and plumes on his godlike head, gives it unreal words, gives a voice without thought, and mimics his gait as he moves; like shapes that flit, it is said, after death or like dreams that mock the slumbering senses. But the phantom stalks exultant in front of the foremost ranks, provokes the foe with weapons, and with cries defies him. Turnus rushes at it, and from afar hurls a hissing spear; the phantom wheels round in flight. Then indeed, when Turnus thought that Aeneas had turned and yielded, and drank this empty hope into his confused mind, he cried: “Where are you fleeing, Aeneas? Forsake not your plighted marriage; this hand of mine will give you the land you have sought over the seas.” With such clamour he chases him and brandishes his

	It chanced that, moored to the ledge of a lofty rock, with ladders let down and gangway ready, stood the ship in which king Osinius sailed from the coasts of Clusium. Hither the hurrying phantom of flying Aeneas flings itself into shelter; and with no less speed Turnus follows, surmounts all hindrances, and springs across the lofty bridge. Scarce had he touched the prow when Saturn’s daughter snaps the cable and sweeps the ship, torn from its moorings, over the ebbing waters. Then the airy phantom seeks shelter no longer, but soaring aloft blends with a dark cloud. But meantime Aeneas is challenging his absent foe to battle, and sends down to death many bodies of warriors who cross his path, while the gale carries Turnus over mid ocean. Unknowing of the truth and unthankful for escape, he looks back and raises his voice and clasped hands to heaven: “Almighty Father, did you think me worthy of so much reproach, and is it your will that I pay such a penalty? Whither am I bound? Where have I come from? What flight withdraws me, and in what guise? Shall I look again on the campor walls of Laurentium? What of that band of warriors who followed me and my standard? One and all—Oh, the shame!—I have left them in the jaws of a cruel death, and now I see them scattered and hear their groans as they fall. What shall I do? What earth could now gape deep enough for me? Rather, you winds take pity on me!

Thrice he tried each way; thrice mighty Juno stayed his hand and held him back in pity of heart.

The Tyrrhene ranks rush together, and press on him alone with all their hatred, on him alone with all their ceaseless weapons. Like a cliff that juts into the vast deep, exposed to the raving winds and braving the main, that endures all the stress, all the menace of sky and sea, itself fixed unshaken—so he lays low on earth Hebrus, son of Dolichaon, and with him Latagus and Palmus, swift of foot; but Latagus he smites suddenly full in the mouth and face with a huge fragment of mountain rock, while Palmus he hamstrings, and leaves him slowly writhing; his armour he gives Lausus to wear upon his shoulders, and his plumes to fix upon his crest.

	There had come from the ancient bounds of Corythus Acron, a Greek, an exile leaving a marriage incomplete. When Mezentius saw him far off, dealing havoc among the ranks, bright in crimson plumes and the bright purple of his plighted bride, just as often an unfed lion, ranging the deep coverts—for maddening hunger prompts him—if by chance he spies a timorous roe or stately antlered stag, exults with mouth terribly agape, bristles his mane, and clings crouching over the flesh, his cruel mouth bathed in foul gore…so Mezentius leaps eagerly upon the massed foemen. Down goes hapless Acron, hammers the black ground with his heels as he breathes his last, and dyes the broken spear with blood. And the same arm did not deign to lay Orodes low as he fled, nor to give an unseen wound with a spear cast; full face to face he ran to meet him and opposed him man against man, prevailing not by stealth but by strength of weapons.

But, breathing his last, Orodes says: “Not unavenged shall I be, my conqueror, whoever you are, nor will you long exult; for a like doom keeps watch for you too, and in these same fields you will soon lie.” Mezentius answered him, smiling in his wrath: “Now die; but as for me let the father of gods and king of men look to it!” So saying, he drew the weapon from the hero’s body; stern repose and iron slumber press upon his eyes, and their light closes into everlasting night.

	mid-ocean, towers with his shoulder above the waves, or, carrying off an aged ash from mountain heights, walks the ground with head hidden in the clouds: like him Mezentius strode in his giant armour. On the other side Aeneas, spying him far off in the battleline, moves to meet him. He stands his ground undaunted, awaiting his noble foe, and steadfast in his bulk; then, with eye measuring the distance that would suffice his spear, he says: “May this right hand, my deity, and the hurtling weapon I poise, now aid me! I vow you, Lausus, your very self, clad in spoils stripped from the robber’s corpse, as my trophy over Aeneas.”
	[c dimgray][sup]24[/sup][/c] He spoke, and threw from far his whistling spear; as it flew, it glanced from the shield, and pierces noble Antores nearby between side and flank—Antores, comrade of Hercules, who, sent from Argos, had joined Evander, and settled in an Italian town. He falls, unlucky man, by a wound meant for another, and gazes on the sky and, dying, dreams of his sweet Argos. Then loyal Aeneas casts a spear; through the hollow shield of threefold bronze, through the layers of linen and the inwoven work of triple bull hides, it sped, and lodged low in the groin; but it did not drive its force home. Quickly Aeneas, gladdened by the sight of the Tuscan’s blood, snatches his sword from the thigh and presses eagerly on his confused foe. Deeply Lausus groaned for love of his dear father, when he saw the sight, and tears rolled down his face—and here the fate of cruel death and your most glorious deeds (if at all antiquity can win belief in such prowess) I will not leave unsung, nor you yourself,

	young man, so worthy to be sung!—the father, disabled and encumbered, was now giving ground with retreating steps, trailing from his shield his foeman’s lance. The youth dashed forward and plunged into the fray; and just as Aeneas’ hand rose to deal a blow, he caught up the hero’s point and checked him by this delay. His comrades follow with loud cries, until the father, guarded by his son’s shield, could withdraw; and showering their javelins beat back the foe with missiles from a distance. Aeneas rages but keeps himself under shelter. And as, when at times storm clouds pour down in showers of hail, every ploughman, every husbandman flees the fields, and the wayfarer cowers in a safe stronghold, a river’s bank or a vault of lofty rock, while the rain falls upon the lands, so that, when the sun returns, they may pursue the day’s task: just so, overwhelmed by javelins on all sides, Aeneas endures the war cloud until all its thunder is spent, while he chides Lausus and threatens Lausus: “Where are you rushing to death, with your daring beyond your strength? Your love is betraying you into rashness.” But none the less the youth rages insanely; now fierce wrath rises higher in the Dardan leader’s heart, and the Fates gather upLausus’ last threads; for Aeneas drives the sword sheer through the youth’s body, and buries it to the hilt. The point pierced the targe—frail armour for one so threatening—and the tunic his mother had woven him of pliant gold; blood filled his breast, then through the air the life fled sorrowing to the Shades, and left the body.

	love for his father entered his heart. “What now, unhappy boy, will loyal Aeneas give you in recognition of these glorious deeds of yours? What reward worthy of such a heart? Keepfor your own the arms in which you delighted; and if you care at all for this, I return you to the spirits and ashes of your forebears. This at least, unhappy man, will console you for your sad death: you fall by the hand of great Aeneas.” Further, he chides his laggard comrades and raises their chief from the ground, where he was befouling his ordered locks with blood.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Meanwhile by the wave of the Tiber river, the father staunched his wounds with water, and rested his reclining frame against the trunk of a tree. Nearby his bronze helmet hangs from the boughs, and his heavy weapons lie in peace on the meadow. Chosen men stand round; he himself, sick and panting, eases his neck, while over his chest streams his flowing beard. Many a time he asks for Lausus, and many a time he sends messengers to recall him, and convey the orders of his grieving father. But his weeping comrades were bearing Lausus lifeless on his armour—a mighty man and laid low by a mighty wound. The ill-boding heart knew their wail from far off. He defiles his hoary hair with dust, raises both hands to heaven, and clings to the body: “My son, did such joy of life possess me that in my stead I let you meet the foeman’s sword—you whom I begot? Am I, your father, saved by these wounds of yours, alive through your death? Alas! now at last I know, wretch that I am, the bitterness of exile; now my wound is driven deep! I myself, my son, have stained your name with guilt—I, driven in loathing from the throne and sceptre of

Now I live on, and do not yet leave the light of day and mankind; but leave I will.” And as he speaks he raises himself on his stricken thigh and, though his force flags from the deepwound, yet, undismayed, he bids his horse be brought. This was his pride, this his solace; on this he rode victorious from every battle. He addresses the grieving beast and accosts it thus: “Rhaebus, we have lived long, if anything lasts long for mortals. Today you will either carry away in victory those bloody spoils and the head of Aeneas, and with me avenge the sufferings of Lausus, or, if no force opens a way, you will die with me; for you, gallant steed, will not deign, I think, to endure a stranger’s orders and a Trojan lord!” He spoke and, mounting the beast, settled his limbs as was his wont, and burdened each hand with sharp javelins, his head glittering with bronze and bristling with horsehair plume. Thus he swiftly dashed into the fray. In that single heart surges a vast tide of shame and madness mingled with grief.

	And now thrice in loud tones he called Aeneas. Aeneas knew the call, and offers joyful prayer: “So may the great father of the gods grant it, so Apollo on high! Let you begin the combat!…” So much said, he moves forward to meet him with levelled spear. But he speaks: “Why seek to frighten me, fierce foe, now that my son is taken? This was the only way in which you could destroy me. We do not shrink from death, nor do we heed any of the gods. Cease; for I come to die, first bringing these gifts.” He spoke, and

	hurled a javelin at his foe; then plants another and yet another, wheeling in wide circle; but the boss of gold withstands them. Thrice round his watchful foe he rode, turning to the left and launching darts from his hand; thrice the Trojan hero bears round with him the dreadful growth of spears upon his bronze shield. Then, weary of dragging out so many delays, of plucking out so many weapons, and hard pressed in the unequal fray, at last with much pondering at heart, he bursts out and hurls his lance full between the war horse’s hollow temples. The steed rears up, lashes the air with its feet, then throws the rider and itself coming down from above, entangles him; then falls on him in headlong plunge, and with shoulder out of joint. Trojans and Latins set heaven aflame with their cries. Aeneas rushes up, tears his sword from the scabbard, and standing over him cries: “Where now is bold Mezentius, and that wild fierceness of soul?” In answer the Tuscan said, as with eyes raised to the air he drank in the heaven and regained his senses: “Bitter foe, why do you taunt me and threaten me with death? It is no sin to slay me; not on such terms did I come to battle, nor is such the pact my Lausus pledged between me and you. This alone I ask, by whatever grace a vanquished foe may claim: let my body to be laid in earth. I know that my people’s fierce hatred besets me. Guard me, I pray, from their fury, and grant me fellowship with my son in the tomb.” So he speaks, and, unfaltering, welcomes the sword to his throat, and pours forth his life over his armour in streams of blood.

	Meanwhile dawn rose and left the ocean. Aeneas, though his sorrows urge him to give time to his comrades’ burial, and death has confused his soul, yet, as the Day Star rose, began to pay the gods his vows of victory.
	[c dimgray][sup]1[/sup][/c] A mighty oak, its branches lopped all round, he plants on a mound, and arrays in the gleaming arms stripped from Mezentius the chief, a trophy to you, great Lord of War.
	[c dimgray][sup]2[/sup][/c] To it he fastens the crests dripping with blood, the warrior’s broken spears, and the breastplate smitten and pierced twice six times; to the left hand he binds the bronze shield, and from the neck hangs the ivory sword. Then his triumphant comrades—for the whole band of chieftains thronged close about him—he thus begins to exhort:

	“Mighty deeds have we wrought, my men; for the future, away with all fear! These are the spoils and firstfruits of a haughty king; and this is Mezentius, as fashioned by my hands.

Around stood all the attendant train and Trojan throng, with the Ilian women, their hair unbound for mourning according to custom. But when Aeneas entered the lofty portal, they smote their breasts and raised a mighty wail to the stars, and the royal dwelling rang with their sorrowful lamentation. He, when he saw the pillowed head and face of Pallas, snowy-white, and, on his smooth breast, the gaping wound from an Ausonian spear, speaks thus, amid welling tears: “Was it you, unhappy boy, that Fortune begrudged me in her happy hour, so that you would not look upon my realm, nor ride triumphant to your father’s home? Not this was the parting promise about you that I gave your father Evander, when he embraced me as I went, and sent me forth to win great empire, but warned me in fear that valiant were the men and hardy the race we confronted.

Unhappy man, you will see the bitter funeral of your son! Is this our return, our awaited triumph? Is this my sure pledge? But your eyes, Evander, will not look on your son routed with shameful wounds nor will you, his father, pray for a death accursed because your son is alive. Ah me! how great a protection is lost to you, Ausonia, how great a one to you, Iülus!”

	His lamentation ended, he bids them raise the piteous corpse, and sends a thousand men chosen from his whole army to attend the last rite and share the father’s tears—scant solace for grief so vast, but owed to a father’s sorrow. Others in haste plait the wicker frame of a soft bier with arbute shoots and oaken twigs, and shroud the high-piled couch with a leafy canopy. Here they lay the youth high on his rustic bed, like a flower culled by a girl’s finger, tender violet or drooping hyacinth, whose sheen and native grace have not yet faded, but no more does its mother earth give it strength and nurture. Then Aeneas brought forth two robes, stiff with gold and purple, which Sidonian Dido, delighting in the toil, had once herself with her own hands wrought for him, interweaving the web with threads of gold. Of these he sadly drapes one round the youth as a last honour, and in its covering veils those locks that the fire will claim; and as well he heaps up many a prize from the Laurentine fray,

	train; then he adds the horses and armour of which he had stripped the foe. He had bound behind their backs the hands of those whom he meant to send as offerings to the Shades, sprinkling the flames with the blood of the slain. He bids the chiefs themselves bear tree trunks draped in hostile weapons with the foemen’s names affixed. Hapless Acoetes, worn out with years, is led along, marring now his breast with clenched fists, now his face with nails, and he falls full-length on the ground. Chariots too they lead, bespattered with Rutulian blood. Behind, the war-steed Aethon, his trappings laid aside, goes weeping, and big drops wet his face.
	[c dimgray][sup]4[/sup][/c] Others carry the spear and helmet: for all else Turnus, as victor, holds. Then follows a mournful host—the Teucrians, and all the Tuscans and the Arcadians with arms reversed. When all the retinue of his comrades had advanced far ahead, Aeneas halted, and with deep sigh spoke this word more: “The same grim destiny of war summons me hence to other tears: hail for evermore, noblest Pallas, and for evermore farewell!” And without further words he turned to the lofty walls and bent his steps towards the camp.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	And now came envoys from the Latin city, shaded with olive boughs and asking for truce; the bodies that lay strewn by the sword all over the plain they prayed him to return and allow to rest beneath a mound of earth. There can be, they plead, no quarrel with vanquished men, bereft of the light of heaven; let him spare men who were once called hosts and fathers of their brides!

	Aeneas courteously grants the prayer he could not spurn, and adds these words besides: “What undeserved chance, Latins, has entangled you in so terrible a war, that you fly from us your friends? Do you ask me peace for the dead slain by the lot of battle? Gladly would I grant it to the living too. I would not have come, had not fate assigned me here a place and home, nor do I wage war with your people: it is your king who forsook our alliance and preferred to trust himself to Turnus’ sword. It would have been juster for Turnus to face this death. If he seeks to end the war by force, if he seeks to drive out the Trojans, he should have fought against me with these weapons: the one of us would have lived to whom heaven or his own right hand had granted life. Now go, and kindle the fire beneath your hapless countrymen.” Aeneas ceased; they stood dumb in silence, and kept their eyes and faces turned on one another.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then aged Drances, who always pursued youthful Turnus with hate and calumny, thus speaks in reply: “Hero of Troy, great in glory, greater in arms, how may I extol you to the sky with my praises? Am I to marvel first at your justice or at your toils in war? We indeed will gratefully bear these words back to our native city and, if fortune grants a way, will unite you with Latinus our king. Let Turnus seek alliances for himself! It will rather be our delight to rear those massive walls which your destiny ordains, and to bear on our shoulders the stones of Troy.” He had spoken, and all with one voice murmured assent. For twice six days they made truce, and, with peace interposing, Teucrians and Latins roamed unharmed over the forest heights

	And now Rumour in her flight, heralding this piercing woe, fills Evander’s ears, his palace and his city—Rumour that but now was proclaiming the triumph of Pallas to the dwellers in Latium. The Arcadians hurry to the gates, having after ancient custom snatched up torches for the funeral. The road gleams with a long procession of flames, which stretches like a broad boundary line across the fields. Meeting them, the Trojan column unites with theirs its company of mourners. When the women saw them approach their homes, their shrieks set the city ablaze with grief. But no restraint can hold Evander back: he rushes into their midst and, as soon as the bier is set down, flings himself on Pallas, clinging to him amid tears and groans, till scarce at last does choking grief allow a path for speech: “Not this, my Pallas, was the promise you gave your father, that you would with caution entrust yourself to the savage god of war. Well did I know the spell upon the young of glory in arms and how passing sweet is honour won in the maiden fight. Alas for the bitter first fruits of your youth and your harsh schooling in a war so close to home! Alas for my prayers and entreaties, to which no god gave ear! And you, Queen of blessed memory, happy were you in the death that saved you from this sorrow! I on the other hand by living on have outpassed my destiny, a father left to survive his son. Would that I had marched with the allied standards of Troy and had fallen beneath the enemy’s fire! Would that I had given up my own life, and this cortege were bringing me, not Pallas, home! Yet I

	would not blame you, Trojans, nor our covenant, nor the hands we clasped in friendship: this fate was owed to my gray hairs. But if untimely death awaited my son, it will be my joy that, after slaying Volscian thousands, he fell leading the Trojans into Latium! Indeed, Pallas, I could think you worthy of no other death than loyal Aeneas does, than the mighty Phrygians, than the Tyrrhene captains, and all the Tyrrhenian host. Great are the trophies those men bring, to whom your hand deals death;
	[c dimgray][sup]6[/sup][/c] you, too, Turnus, would now be standing, a monstrous trunk arrayed in arms, had your age and strength of years been like his! But why do I, poor wretch, stay the Teucrians from conflict? Go, and forget not to bear this message to your king: if I drag on a life that is hateful now that Pallas is slain, the reason is your right hand, which you know owes Turnus to son and to father. That field alone is open for your merits and your fortune. I ask not for joy in life—that cannot be—but to bear the word to my son in the shades below.”

	Meanwhile Dawn had lifted up her kindly light for weary men, recalling them to task and toil. Now father Aeneas, now Tarchon, had set up pyres on the winding shore. Here, after the fashion of their fathers, they each brought the bodies of their kin, and as the murky fires are lit beneath, high heaven is veiled in the gloom of darkness. Thrice, girt in glittering armour, they ran their course round the blazing piles; thrice on horseback they circled the mournful funeral-fire and uttered the cries of wailing. Tears stream on earth, and stream on armour; cries of men and blare of trumpets mount to heaven. And now some

Around, many cattle are sacrificed to Death; bristly swine and animals seized from all the country are slaughtered over the flames. Then, all along the shore, they watch their comrades burning, and keepguard above the charred pyres, and they cannot tear themselves away till dewy night rolls round the heaven, inset with gleaming stars.

	No less, elsewhere, do the hapless Latins build pyres innumerable. Of their many dead, some they bury in the earth, some they lift up and carry to the neighbouring fields or send home to the city; the rest, a mighty mass of indistinguishable slaughter, they burn uncounted and unhonoured: then on all sides the broad fields compete with their clusters of fire. The third dawn had withdrawn chill darkness from the sky; mournfully they stirred from the pyres the bones mingled with thick ash, and heaped above them a warm mound of earth. But inside the walls, in the city of rich Latinus, is the chief uproar and most of the prolonged wailing. Here mothers and their sons’ unhappy brides, here the loving hearts of sorrowing sisters, and boys bereft of their fathers, curse the dreadful war and Turnus’ marriage: “He, he himself,” they cry, “should decide the issue by arms and the sword, he who claims for himself the realm of Italy and foremost honours.” Fierce Drances weights the scale, and bears witness that Turnus alone is called, alone is summoned to battle.

	Amid this stir, at the fiery turmoil’s height, lo! to crown everything, gloomy envoys bring the answer from Dio-medes’ great city: nothing has been gained at cost of so much toil; nothing have their gifts of gold or strong prayers achieved: Latium must seek other arms or sue for peace to the Trojan king. Beneath his weight of grief even king Latinus sinks. That Aeneas is called by fate, guided by heaven’s clear will, is the warning given by angry gods and the fresh graves before his eyes. Therefore his high council, the foremost of his people, he summons by royal command and convenes within his lofty portals. They assembled, streaming to the king’s palace through the crowded streets. In their midst, oldest in years and first in regal state, with little joy upon his brow, sits Latinus, and now bids the envoys, returned from the Aetolian city, tell what tidings they bring back, and demands full answers, each in turn. Then silence fell on all tongues and, obedient to his word, Venulus thus begins:

	“‘O happy peoples of Saturn’s realm, sons of old Ausonia, what chance vexes your calm and lures you to provoke unknown warfare? All we who with steel profaned the fields of Troy—I do not mention the sorrows we suffered in war beneath her high walls, the heroes drowned in the Simois—the wide world over, we have paid in nameless tortures all manner of penalties for our guilt, a band that even Priam might pity: witness Minerva’s baleful star, the Euboic cliffs, and avenging Caphereus.
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] From that warfare driven to diverse shores, Menelaus, son of Atreus, is in exile so far away as the pillars of Proteus; and Ulysses has looked on the Cylopes of Aetna. Even the Mycenaean, the chief of the mighty Achaeans, scarce over the threshold, fell by his wicked wife’s hand; after his conquest of Asia an adulterer lay in wait.
	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] Need I tell of the realm of Neoptolemus and the home of Idomeneus overthrown, or of the Locrians who dwell on Libya’s shore? To think that the gods begrudged me return to my country’s altars, and sight of the wife I long for, and lovely Calydon! Even now portents of dreadful view pursue me; my lost comrades have winged their way to the sky or haunt the streams as birds—alas, the dire punishment of my people!—and fill the cliffs with their tearful cries.

	[c dimgray][sup]10[/sup][/c] Do not, do not urge me to such battles! I have no war with Teucer’s race since Troy’s towers fell, and I have no joyful memory of those ancient ills. The gifts that you bring me from your country, take them rather to Aeneas. We have faced his fierce weapons, and fought him hand to hand: trust one who has experienced it, how huge he looms above his shield, with what whirlwind he hurls his spear! Had Ida’s land borne two others like him, the Trojans would even have stormed the towns of Inachus,
	[c dimgray][sup]11[/sup][/c] and Greece would be mourning, with fate reversed. In all the time we spent before the walls of stubborn Troy, it was by the hand of Hector and Aeneas that the Greeks’ victory was delayed and driven back till the tenth year. Both were renowned for courage, both eminent in arms; Aeneas was first in loyalty. Join hand to hand in treaty, as best you may; but beware your swords clash not with his!’ You have heard, noble King, what the King replies, and what he counsels on this mighty war.”

	Scarcely had the envoys spoken thus when a various murmur ran along the troubled lips of Ausonia’s sons: just as, when rocks delay a rushing river, there rises a roar from the pent-up flood, and the neighbouring banks echo to the plashing waters. As soon as minds were calmed and restless tongues were hushed, the king, first calling on heaven, from his high throne begins:

	our walls. My countrymen, we are waging an ill-omened war with a race divine, with men unconquered; no battles weary them and even in defeat they cannot let go the sword. If you had any hope in alliance with Aetolian arms, resign it. Each is his own hope; but you see how slender this is. As for the rest of your fortunes, it is before your eyes, and all is in your grasp, in what wide ruin they lie smitten. I do not blame anyone; what valour’s utmost could do is done; we have striven with our realm’s whole strength. Now mark: the judgment of my wavering mind I will unfold and, if you pay heed, will instruct you in brief. There is an ancient domain of mine bordering the Tuscan river, stretching far westward, even beyond Sicanian bounds. Auruncans and Rutulians sow the seed, work the stubborn hills with the plough and graze their roughest slopes. Let all this tract, with a pine-clad belt of mountain height, pass to the Trojans in friendship; let us name just terms of treaty, and invite them to share our realm. Let them settle, if their desire is so strong, and build their city. But if they have a mind to lay hold of other territories and another nation, and can leave our soil, let us build twice ten ships of Italian oak; or, if they can man more, all the timber lies at the water’s edge; let them prescribe the number and design of their vessels themselves; let us contribute bronze, labour, and docks. Further, to bring the news and seal the pact, I would have a hundred envoys go forth, Latins of noblest birth, holding boughs of peace in their hands, and carrying gifts—talent-weights of gold and ivory, and a throne and robe, signs of our royalty. Take counsel together and restore our weary fortunes!”

	Then Drances, hostile as before, whom the renown of Turnus goaded with the bitter stings of furtive envy, lavish of wealth and valiant of tongue, though his hand was cold in battle, in counsel deemed no mean adviser, in faction strong (his mother’s high birth ennobled his lineage; from his father he drew obscure rank), rises and with these words loads and heaps high their wrath:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“A subject dark to no one and needing no voice of ours, gracious king, you consult us on. All admit that they know what course the public fortune prompts, but they shrink from speech. Let that man grant liberty of speech and abate his blustering pride, through whose ill-starred leadership and perverse ways (yes, I will speak, though he threaten me with arms and death) we see so many glorious leaders have fallen and the whole city is sunk in mourning, while he, confident in his ability to flee, assails the Trojan camp and frightens heaven with his weapons. Add one more to those many gifts you bid us send and promise to the sons of Dardanus—one more, most gracious king—and let no man’s violence prevail to stop you from giving your daughter, as a father may, to a peerless son in a worthy marriage, and making this bond of peace in eternal covenant. But if such terror possesses our minds and hearts, let us entreat the prince himself and implore him, of his grace, to yield, and give up his own rights
	[c dimgray][sup]12[/sup][/c] to king and country. You who are the source and cause of these woes of Latium, why do you so often hurl your unhappy countrymen into open danger? There is no safety in war; for peace we ask you, Turnus, one and all, together with the one inviolable

Or, if glory moves you, if you feel such strength in your heart, or if the dowry of a palace is so dear to you, be bold, and fearlessly advance to meet the foe. Oh yes, to be sure, so that Turnus can gain his royal bride, let us, whose lives are worthless, be strewn over the fields, a mob unburied and unwept. But you too, if you have any strength, if you have any of the fighting spirit of your fathers, look your challenger in the face!...”

	At these words the fury of Turnus blazed out: he heaves a groan, and from the depth of his heart breaks forth with this cry: “Drances, you always have a full flow of speech at the time when battle calls for hands; and when the senate is summoned, you are first to appear! But we need not fill the council house with words—those big words that fly from your lips when you are safe, while the rampart walls keep off the foe, and the trenches are not yet swimming with blood. Keep thundering on in eloquence (in your usual way) and charge me with cowardice, Drances, when your hand has produced such mounds of dead Teucrians and marked out the fields everywhere with trophies. You are free to test what lively courage can do; and, as you see, we need not look far afield for enemies: they surround the walls on every side. Are we going to advance against the foe? Why do you hesitate? Will your spirit of war always remain in your windy tongue and those runaway feet of yours? ...I beaten, you say?

	very start? Why does trembling seize our limbs before the trumpet sounds? Many an ill has been repaired by time and the shifting toil of changing years; many a man Fortune, fitful visitant, has mocked, then once more set up upon firm ground. The Aetolian and his Arpi will be no helpto us: but Messapus will be, and Tolumnius the fortunate, and all the leaders sent by many a nation; no scant fame will come to the flower of Latium and the Laurentine land. We have Camilla too, of the glorious Volscian race, leading her troop of horse and squadrons bright with bronze. But if I alone am called by the Teucrians to combat, and such is your will, and I am so great an obstruction of the common good, Victory has not fled from these hands of mine with such loathing that I refuse to dare anything for a hope so high. I will face him boldly, though he outmatch great Achilles and wear armour to match, wrought by Vulcan’s hands. To you and my bride’s father Latinus I, Turnus, second in valour to none of my fathers, dedicate my life. Aeneas alone challenges me, you say. I pray that he does challenge me, and that it is not Drances rather than I who appeases the gods by his death, if they are angry, or wins glory for his courage, if that is the prize here.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Thus, in mutual strife they were debating doubtful issues: Aeneas meanwhile moved from campto field. Amid wild uproar, lo, a messenger rushes through the royal halls and fills the city with great alarms: in battle array, he cries, the Teucrians and the Tyrrhene force are sweeping down from the Tiber river over all the plain. At once the minds of the people are confounded, their hearts shaken, and their passions roused by ungentle spurs. Brandishing their fists they call for weapons; “Weapons!” the young men shout;

	their unhappy fathers weep and moan. And now, from every side, there rises to heaven a loud din with varied discord just as when flocks of birds settle by chance in some tall grove, or when, by Padusa’s fish-filled stream, hoarse-throated swans call among the clamorous pools. “Very well, then, my fellow citizens,” cries Turnus, seizing the moment, “convene a council and sit there praising peace; our enemies are attacking our realm under arms.” He said no more, but sprang up and sped swiftly forth from the high halls. “Volusus,” he cries, “bid the Volscian squadrons arm, and lead out the Rutulians! You, Messapus, and you, Coras, with your brother deploy the cavalry under arms over the broad plains. Let some guard the city gates and man the towers; let the rest charge with me, where I shall command.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At once from all over the city there is a rush to the walls. Father Latinus himself, dismayed by the grimness of the hour, quits the council and postpones his high designs, often chiding himself that he did not give a ready welcome to Dardan Aeneas and did not, for the city’s sake, adopt him as a son. Others dig trenches in front of the gates or shoulder stones and stakes. The hoarse clarion gives bloody signal for battle. Then a motley ring of matrons and boys girdles the walls; the final struggle summons them all. Moreover the queen, with a great throng of mothers, drives
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] up to the temple of Pallas and her towered heights, bearing gifts, and at her side the maiden Lavinia, the source of all that woe, her beautiful eyes lowered. As they go up, the matrons fill the temple with the smoke of

And now he had donned his flashing breastplate and bristled with bronze scales; his legs he had sheathed in gold, though his temples were yet bare, and he had buckled his sword to his side. He shone with gold as he ran down from the fortress height; he exults in courage, and in his hopes he is already seizing the foe—just as, when a horse, bursting his tether, has fled the stalls, free at last, and, lord of the open plain, either he makes for the pastures and herds of mares or, accustomed to bathe in a familiar river, he dashes away and, with head held high in wanton joy, neighs, while his mane plays over neck and shoulder.

	Attended by the Volscian army, Camilla sped to meet him, and near the gates the queen leaped from her horse; at her example all her troop left their mounts and slid to the ground.

Let me try war’s first perils with my hand while you stay on foot by the walls and guard the town.” Turnus, with his eyes fixed upon the formidable maiden, replied: “Maiden, glory of Italy, what thanks can I try to utter or repay? But now, since your spirit soars above all, share the toil with me. Aeneas—so rumour tells, and scouts sent out confirm—has insolently sent forward his

I am laying snares of war in an over-arched pathway in the wood, to block the gorge’s two entrances with armed troops. You, in battle array, must await the Tyrrhene cavalry; with you will be the valiant Messapus, the Latin squadrons, and Tiburtus’ troop: you too must take the duty of a captain.” So he speaks, and with similar words he heartens Messapus and the allied captains to battle, and moves against the foe.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	There is a valley with sweeping curve, fit site for the stratagems and deceits of war, hemmed in on either side by a wall black with dense foliage. To it a narrow path leads, with straitened gorge and awkward approach. Above it, amid the watch towers of the mountain top, lies a hidden plain and a safe shelter, whether one plans to charge from right or left, or take stand upon the ridge and roll down enormous boulders. Hither the warrior hastens by a well-known road and, seizing his ground, lay in wait in the treacherous woods.

	Meanwhile, in Heaven’s halls Latona’s daughter addressed swift Opis, one of her maiden sisterhood and sacred band, and opened her lips to these words of sorrow: “Camilla is marching to the cruel war, O maiden, and vainly girds on our arms, Camilla, whom I love as none besides. For no new love is this that has come upon Diana nor sudden the spell wherewith it has stirred her heart.

Carrying her before him on his breast, he made for a stretch of mountain ridges lonely and forest-clad. On every side hostile weapons pressed upon him, the Volscians hovering around him with their troops. While they were still in mid-flight, the Amasenus overflowed and foamed over the summit of its banks: so great a downpour had burst from the clouds. The exile, about to swim the flood, is checked by love of his child and fears for his precious burden. Quickly as he pondered all courses in his mind, he settled on this reluctant resolve: the giant spear, which the warrior chanced to be carrying in his stalwart hand, hard-knotted and of seasoned oak—to this he fastens his daughter, wrapped in bark of forest cork, and binds her closely round the centre of the shaft. Then, poising it in his mighty right hand, he cries thus to the heavens: “Gracious lady, dweller in the woods, virgin daughter of Latona, to your service I, her father, vow this child; yours is this first weapon that she clasps as a suppliant, speeding through the air in flight from her foe. Accept, goddess, for your own, I implore you, the child whom I now commit to the perils of the air!” He has spoken and, drawing back his arm, launches the spinning shaft: loud roared the waters, over the rushing river poor Camilla speeds her flight upon the strident steel. But Metabus, now that a great band pressed closer upon him, leaps into the stream, and in triumph plucks from the grassy turf his offering to Trivia, the spear and the maid. No cities received him to their homes or walls, nor in his wild mood would he himself have yielded to them: among shepherds and on the lonely mountains he passed his days.

And as soon as the baby had taken her earliest footsteps, he armed her hands with a pointed lance, and hung quiver and bow from the little child’s shoulder. In place of gold to clasp her hair, in place of long trailing robe, there hung from her head and down her back a tiger’s spoils. Even then with tender hand she hurled her childish spears, swung round her head the smooth-thonged sling, and struck down Strymonian crane or snowy swan. Many a mother in Tyrrhene towers longed in vain for her as daughter; content with Diana alone, she cherishes unsullied a lifelong love for her weapons and her maidenhood. I would that she had not been swept away in warfare such as this, nor tried to challenge the Teucrians: she would still be my darling and one of my companions. But come, since untimely doom weighs upon her, swoop down from heaven, nymph, and seek the Latin borders, where under evil omen they join in the dreadful fray. Take these,

On the other side, too, Messapus and the fleet Latins, and Coras with his brother, and maid Camilla’s troop, come into view, confronting them on the plain; with hands drawn far back they thrust the lance and brandish the javelin; the marching of men and neighing of steeds grows fierce. And now in its advance each army had halted within a spear cast of the other; with a sudden shout they dash forth, and spur on their furious steeds; together from all sides they shower weapons as thick as snowflakes, and the sky is veiled in darkness. At once Tyrrhenus and fierce Aconteus charge each other full force with spears, and are first to go down with a mighty crash, breaking and shattering their horses as they collide breast to breast. Flung off like a thunderbolt or a stone shot from a catapult, Aconteus is hurled headlong far away, and scatters his life into the air.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	At once the lines waver, and the routed Latins cast their shields behind them, and turn their horses toward the city walls. The Trojans give chase; Asilas in the van leads the squadrons. And now they were approaching the gates when again the Latins raise their shout, and wheel about their horses’ supple necks; the others flee, and retreat far off with loosened rein: as when the ocean, advancing with alternate flood, now rushes shoreward, dashes over the cliffs in a wave of foam, and drenches the furthest sands with its swelling curve; now flees in fast retreat and in its wash sucks back rolling stones, leaving the sands dry as

	the shallows retreat. Twice the Tuscans drove the routed Rutulians to the city; twice, repulsed, they glance backwards, as they sling behind them their protecting shields. But when, clashing in the third encounter, the lines stood interlocked along their whole length, and man marked man, then in truth there were groans of the dying, and arms and bodies and horses, dying and mingled with slaughtered riders, all weltering deep in blood: the fight swells fiercely. Orsilochus hurled a lance at Remulus’ steed—for he feared to meet its lord—and left the steel beneath its ear. At this blow the charger rears furious and, unable to bear the wound, with chest raised flings his legs on high; unseated, Remulus rolls on the ground. Catillus strikes down Iollas, and Herminius, giant in courage, giant in body and arms; on his bare head stream his tawny locks, and bare are his shoulders; for him wounds have no terrors; so vast a frame faces the steel. Through his broad shoulders the driven spear comes quivering and, piercing through, bends him double with pain. Everywhere the dark blood streams; they deal carnage, clashing with the sword, and seek a glorious death among the wounds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But in the heart of the slaughter, like an Amazon, one breast bared for the fray, and girt with a quiver, rages Camilla; and now she showers tough javelins thick from her hand, now she snatches a stout battle axe with unwearied grasp; the golden bow, armour of Diana, clangs from her shoulders. And even when, pressed from behind, she withdraws, she turns her bow and aims arrows in her flight. And round her are her chosen comrades, the maiden Larina, and Tulla, and Tarpeia, wielding an axe of bronze, daughters of Italy, whom godlike Camilla herself chose to be her glory, good handmaids in both peace and war.

	Such are the Amazons of Thrace, when they tramp over Thermodon’s streams and war in blazoned armour, whether round Hippolyte, or when Penthesilea, child of Mars, returns in her chariot and, amid loud tumultuous cries, the army of women exult with crescent shields.

	Fierce maiden, whom first, whom last do you strike down with your weapon? How many bodies do you lay low on the earth? First Euneus, son of Clytius, whose unguarded breast, as he faces her, she pierces through with her long pine-shaft. Coughing streams of blood, he falls, bites the gory dust and, dying, writhes upon his wound. Then she fells Liris, and Pagasus over him: while one, thrown from his stabbed horse, gathers up the reins and the other, coming up, stretches an unharmed hand to stay his fall, they fall headlong together. To these she adds Amastrus, son of Hippotas; and, bending to the task, she follows Tereus from far with her spear, and Harpalycus, and Demophoon, and Chromis; and as many weapons as she sent spinning from her hand, so many Phrygians fell. At a distance rides the hunter Ornytus in strange armour on an Iapygian steed: a hide stripped from a steer swathes the warrior’s broad shoulders, his head is shielded by a wolf’s huge gaping mouth and white-fanged jaws, and his hand is armed with a rustic pike; he himself moves in the midmost ranks, a full head above all. She caught—for it was easy amid the rout—and pierced him, then above him thus cries with pitiless heart: “Tuscan, did you think you were chasing beasts in the forests? The day is come that will refute your boasts with woman’s weapons. But you will carry no small fame to your ancestral shades—that you fell

	Next she slays Orsilochus and Butes, two Teucrians of mightiest frame. Butes she pierced with a spearpoint in the back, between corslet and helmet, where the rider’s neck gleams, and the shield hangs from the left arm; as she flees from Orsilochus and is chased in a wide circle, she foils him, wheels into an inner ring and pursues the pursuer; then rising higher in the saddle, she drives her strong axe again and again through armour and through bone, while he implores and makes many prayers for mercy; the wound spatters his face with his warm brain. Now there fell in her way, and paused in terror at the sudden sight of her, the warrior son of Aunus, dweller upon the Apennine, not the least of the Ligurians while Fate allowed him to deceive.
	[c dimgray][sup]15[/sup][/c] When he sees that by no fleetness can he escape combat or divert the queen from her attack, he tries to concoct a stratagem with policy and craft and thus begins: “What great glory have you, woman, if you put your trust in your strong steed? Forget flight; dare to meet me hand to hand on equal ground, and gird yourself to fight on foot; soon you will know to whom windy vanity brings deception.” He spoke, but she, furious and burning with the bitter smart, hands her horse over to a comrade and confronts him in equal arms, on foot and unafraid, with naked sword and shield unblazoned. But the youth, thinking that he had won by guile, himself darts away instantly and, turning his bridle, rushes off in flight, goading his charger to speed with iron spur. “Foolish Ligurian, vainly puffed up in pride of heart, in vain you have tried your slippery native tricks; cunning will not take you home unscathed to lying Aunus!”

	But with not unseeing eyes the father of gods and men sits throned on high Olympus, viewing the scene. He rouses Tyrrhenian Tarchon to the fierce battle, and fills him with wrath by no gentle spur. So, amid the slaughter and wavering columns, Tarchon rides, and goads his squadrons with diverse cries, calling each man by name, and rallying the routed to the fight. “You Tuscans, who will never be stung by shame, sluggards always, what fear, what utter cowardice has fallen on your hearts? Does a woman drive you in disorder and rout your ranks? For what reason do we bear swords, why these idle weapons, in our hands? But you are not laggard for love and nightly frays, or when the curved flute proclaims the Bacchic dance. Wait for the feasts and the cups on the loaded board (this is your passion, this your delight!) till the favouring seer announces the sacrifice, and the fat victim calls you to the deep groves!” So saying, he spurs his horse into the throng, ready himself also to die, and charges like a whirlwind full at Venulus; tearing the foe from his horse, he grips him with his right hand, clasps him to his breast, and, mightily spurring on his horse, carries him off. A shout rises to heaven, as all the Latins turned their eyes on the sight.

	Like lightning Tarchon flies over the plain, carrying away the arms and the man; then he breaks off the iron from the head of his foe’s spear and searches for an unguarded place where he may deal a deadly wound; the other, struggling against him, keeps the hand from off his throat and baffles force with force. And as when a tawny eagle, soaring on high, carries a serpent she has caught, her feet entwined and her claws clinging tight, but the wounded snake writhes its sinuous coils, and rears its bristling scales, and hisses with its mouth, towering aloft; none the less with crooked beak she assails her struggling victim, while her wings beat the air: just so from the Tiburtian line Tarchon carries off his prey in triumph. Following their chief’s example and success, Maeonia’s sons attack. Then Arruns, his life owed to the fates, first circles round fleet Camilla with javelin and deep cunning and tries what chance may be easiest. Wherever the maiden rides among the ranks in her fury, there Arruns creeps up and silently tracks her footsteps; where she returns victorious and retires from the foe, there the youth stealthily turns his swift reins.

Whether hoping to fasten upTrojan arms in a temple or to flaunt herself in golden spoil, the maiden singled him out from all the battle fray and like a huntress was blindly pursuing him, recklessly raging through all the ranks with a woman’s passion for booty and spoil, when at length, seizing the chance, Arruns from ambush rouses his lance, and thus prays aloud to Heaven: “Apollo, most high of gods, guardian of holy Soracte, whose chief worshippers are we, for whom the blaze of the pine wood heap is fed, while we, your votaries, pass through the fire in strength of faith and plant our steps on the deep embers

He favoured the prayer that he might overthrow and strike down Camilla in sudden death; that his noble country should see his return he did not grant, and the blasts bore the prayer to the southern gates.

	queen. She herself noticed neither air nor sound nor weapon coming from the sky till the spear, borne home, found lodging beneath the bare breast and, driven deep, drank her maiden blood. In alarm, her comrades hurry around her, and catch their falling queen. More alarmed than the rest, Arruns flees in mingled joy and fear, and no more dares to trust his lance, or to meet the maiden’s weapons. And just as the wolf, when he has slain a shepherd or a great steer, before hostile darts can pursue him, at once plunges by pathless ways among the high mountains, conscious of a reckless deed, and lowering his tail holds it quivering beneath his belly, and seeks the woods: just so does Arruns, in confusion, steal away from sight and, satisfied to escape, plunge into the armed throng. She tugs at the weapon with dying hand but in the deep wound the iron point stands fast between the bones, close to the ribs. Bloodless she sinks; her eyes sink, chill with death; the once radiant hue has left her face. Then, as her breath fails, she thus accosts Acca, one of her age-mates, true to Camilla beyond all the others, sole sharer of her cares, and thus she speaks: “So far, sister Acca, has my strength availed; now the bitter wound overpowers me, and all around grows dim and dark. Hurry away, and bring to Turnus my latest orders: to take my place in the battle, and ward off the Trojans from the town. And now farewell!” With these words she dropped the reins, slipping helplessly to earth. Then, growing chill, she slowly freed herself from all the body’s bonds, drooped her nerveless neck and the head which Death had seized, letting fall her weapons,

	and with a moan her life fled resentfully to the Shades below. Then indeed a boundless uproar rose, striking the golden stars: Camilla fallen, the fight waxes fiercer; on they rush in crowds together, all the Teucrian host, the Tyrrhene chiefs, and Evander’s Arcadian squadrons.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But Opis, Trivia’s sentinel, has long been seated high on the mountain top, and, undismayed, watches the combat. And when far off, amid the din of raging warriors, she saw that Camilla had paid the penalty of death, she sighed and from her heart’s depth uttered these words: “Alas! too cruel, too cruel, maiden, the forfeit you have paid for trying to defy the Teucrians in battle! It has availed you nothing that, alone in the woodlands, you worshipped Diana and wore our quiver on your shoulder. But your queen has not left you unhonoured even in death’s last hour; nor will your doom be without renown among the nations, nor will you bear the reproach of one unavenged; for whoever profaned your limbs with this wound will pay the debt of death.” Under the mountain height stood a mound of earth, the mighty tomb of Dercennus, Laurentine king of old, screened by shadowy ilex; here first the beautiful goddess, with swift spring, plants her feet, and from the high barrow espies Arruns. When she saw him blazing in his armour and swelling with pride, she cried, “Why do you stray so far? Turn your steps this way, come this way to your death and for Camilla receive the reward you deserve! Shall you too die by Diana’s darts?” So spoke the Thracian nymph, and from gilded quiver plucked a winged shaft, stretched the bow with full intent, and drew it far, till the

Straightway, at the selfsame moment, Arruns heard the whistling dart and whirring air, and the steel was lodged in his breast. As he gasps and groans his last breaths, his forgetful comrades leave him on the unknown dust of the plain; Opis wings her way to heavenly Olympus.

	Their mistress lost, Camilla’s light squadron flees first; in rout the Rutulians flee, valiant Atinas flees; scattered captains, and troops left leaderless, make for shelter and, wheeling their horses, gallop to the walls. Nor can any check with their weapons the onset of the death-dealing Trojans, nor stand against it, but cast their unstrung bows on fainting shoulders, and in their galloping course the horsehoof shakes the crumbling plain. On to the walls rolls a cloud of dust, black and murky, and from the watch-towers mothers, beating their breasts, raise to the stars of heaven their womanish cries. Upon those who first broke at full speed through the open gates there presses hard a throng of foes, mingling with their ranks, nor do they escape a piteous death, but on the very threshold, their native walls about them, and within the shelter of their homes, they are pierced through, and gasp away their lives. Some close the gates, and dare not open a way to their friends, nor receive them inside the walls, implore as they may; and slaughter most pitiful ensues, both of those guarding the entry sword in hand, and of those rushing upon the sword. Shut out before the eyes and gaze of weeping parents, some, driven by the rout, roll headlong into the trenches; some, charging blindly with loosened

The very mothers from the walls, in keenest rivalry (true love of country points the way), when they marked Camilla, fling weapons with trembling hands, and hastily do the work of steel with stout oaken poles and seared stakes, and burn to be the first to die defending their walls.

	Meanwhile in the forests the woeful tidings fill Turnus’ ears, and Acca brings the warrior her tale of mighty turmoil: the Volscian ranks destroyed, Camilla fallen, the foe fiercely advancing and sweeping the field in triumphant warfare, the panic now passing to the town. He, raging—and Jove’s stern will so demands—quits the hills’ ambush, and leaves the rough woodland. Scarce had he passed from view and reached the plain when father Aeneas, entering the unguarded pass, scales the ridge, and issues from the shady wood. So both march toward the walls, swiftly and in full force, and not far distant from each other: and at the same moment Aeneas descried far off the plain smoking with dust and saw the Laurentine hosts, and Turnus was aware of fell Aeneas in arms, and heard the march of feet and the snorting of steeds. And they would enter the fray at once and try the issue of battle, but ruddy Phoebus already bathes his weary team in the Iberian flood and, as day ebbs, brings back the night. Before the city they encamp and strengthen the ramparts.

	When Turnus sees the Latins crushed and faint of heart through war’s reverse, his own pledge now claimed, and himself the mark of every eye, forthwith he blazes with wrath unappeasable and raises his courage. As in Punic fields a lion, when wounded in the chest by huntsmen with a grievous stroke, only then wakes to war, joyously tosses from his neck his shaggy mane, and undaunted breaks the robber’s implanted dart, roaring with blood-stained mouth: even so in Turnus’ kindling soul the fury swells. Then thus he accosts the king, and with these wild words begins: “No delay lies with Turnus! There is no reason for the coward sons of Aeneas to recall their words or to renounce their pact! I go to meet him. Bring on the holy rites, father, and frame the covenant. Either with this arm I will hurl to Tartarus the Dardan, the Asian runaway—let the Latins sit and see it—and with my sword alone refute the nation’s shame,

	most gracious lord, on my behalf, I pray, resign, and suffer me to barter death for fame.

	But the queen, dismayed by the new terms of conflict, wept and, ready to die, clung to her fiery son: “Turnus, by these my tears, by any reverence for Amata that yet may touch your heart—you are now my only hope, the comfort of my sad old age; in your hands are the honour and sovereignty of Latinus, on you rests all our sinking house—one boon I beg: forbear to join combat with the Trojans. Whatever perils await you in that combat await me also, Turnus; with you I will quit this hateful light, and I will not in captivity see Aeneas as my son.” Lavinia heard her mother’s words, her burning cheeks steeped in tears, while a deep blush kindled its fire, and mantled her glowing face. As when someone stains Indian ivory with crimson dye, or white lilies blush when mingled with many a rose—such hues her maiden features showed. Love throws Turnus into turmoil, and he fastens his gaze upon the maid; then, fired yet more for the fray, he briefly addresses Amata: “I beseech you, mother, do not send me off with tears or such ill omen as I go forth to stern war’s conflicts; for Turnus is not free to delay his death. Idmon, be my herald and bear my message to the Phrygian king—a message he will not welcome: as soon as tomorrow’s Dawn, riding in crimson

	When he has spoken these words and hurried back into the palace, he calls for his steeds, and exults to see them neighing before his face—the steeds that Orithyia herself gave as a glory to Pilumnus, because they excelled the snows in whiteness and the gales in speed. The eager charioteers stand round, patting with hollow palms their sounding chests, and combing their flowing manes. Next he binds upon his shoulders a corslet stiff with gold and pale mountain bronze; at the same time he fits on sword and shield and the horns of his ruddy crest;
	[c dimgray][sup]7[/sup][/c] the sword the divine Lord of Fire had himself wrought for his father Daunus and dipped, all glowing, in the waters of Styx. Then, as it stood leaning on a giant column in the middle of the hall, he seizes with strong hand his mighty spear, spoil of Auruncan Actor, and shakes it quivering, while he cries aloud: “Now, spear that never failed my call, now the hour is come! Mighty Actor once bore you; now the hand of Turnus wields you. Grant me to lay low the body of the Phrygian eunuch, with strong hand to tear and rend away his corslet, and to defile in dust his locks, crisped with heated iron and drenched in myrrh!” Such is the frenzy driving him: from all his face shoot fiery sparks; his eager eyes flash flame—even as a bull, before the battle begins, raises a fearful bellowing, and, as he tries to throw wrath into his horns, charges a tree’s trunk; he lashes the winds with his blows, and paws the sand in prelude for the fray.

	[c dimgray][sup]8[/sup][/c] whets his valour and rouses his heart with wrath, rejoicing that the war is being settled by the compact offered. Then he comforts his comrades, and sad Iülus’ fear, expounding the fates, and bids them bear firm answer to King Latinus and declare the terms of peace.

	The next dawn was just beginning to sprinkle the mountain tops with light, at the time when the Sun’s steeds first rise from the deepflood, and breathe light from raised nostrils: Rutulians and Teucrians had measured the field for the combat under the great city’s walls, and in the middle were preparing hearths and grassy altars to their common deities. Others were bringing fountain water and fire, draped in aprons
	[c dimgray][sup]9[/sup][/c] and their brows bound with vervain. The Ausonian host comes forth, and the troops, close-ranked, pour from the crowded gates. On this side streams forth all the Trojan and Tyrrhene host in diverse accoutrements, armed in steel as if the harsh battle strife called them. No less, amid their thousands, do the captains dart to and fro, brilliant in gold and purple, Mnestheus of the line of Assaracus, and brave Asilas, and Messapus, tamer of horses, seed of Neptune. As soon as, on the given signal, each has retired to his own ground, they plant their spears in the earth, and rest their shields against them. Then, eagerly streaming forth, mothers and the unarmed throng, and feeble old men, have beset towers and housetops; others stand upon the lofty gates.

	But Juno, from the hill now called Alban—at that time the mount had neither name nor fame nor honour—looking forth, gazed upon the plain, upon the double lines of Laurentum and Troy, and upon the city of Latinus. Straightway, goddess to goddess, she spoke thus to Turnus’ sister, mistress of the ponds and sounding rivers: this honour Jupiter, heaven’s high lord, assigned to her in return for theft of maidenhood: “Nymph, glory of rivers, most dear to my heart, you know how, above all Latin maids that have mounted to great-hearted Jove’s thankless bed, I have preferred you alone, and have gladly given you a place in heaven: learn, Juturna, the grief that will be yours, lest you blame me. Where Fortune seemed to permit, and the Fates suffered Latium’s state to prosper, I shielded Turnus and your city. Now I see the prince confront unequal destiny; the day of doom, and the enemy’s stroke, draws nigh. Upon this battle, this treaty, my eyes cannot look: you, if you dare to do anything of more present help for your brother, go on; it befits you. Perhaps happier days will come to those who are now unhappy.”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Scarcely had she said this when Juturna’s eyes streamed with tears, and thrice, even four times her hand smote her comely breast. “This is no time for tears,” cries Saturnian Juno; “hasten, and if there is any way, snatch your brother from death; or rouse battle, and strike from their hands the treaty they have framed. I it is who bid you dare.” Having counselled thus, she left her doubtful and distracted by the cruel wound to her heart.

On this side father Aeneas, source of the Roman stock, ablaze with starry shield and celestial arms, and beside him Ascanius, second hope of mighty Rome, issue from the camp; while a priest in spotless raiment has brought the young of a bristly boar and an unshorn sheep of two years old, and set the beasts beside the blazing altars.

Iülus shall quit the land; and never in after time shall the sons of Aeneas return for renewed war, or attack this realm with the sword.

	[m1]\ [/m]
	Thus first Aeneas speaks, and after him Latinus thus follows, lifting eyes to heaven, and stretching his right hand to the stars: “By these same Powers I swear, Aeneas, by earth, sea, stars, Latona’s twofold offspring, and two-faced Janus, and the might of gods below, and the shrines of cruel Dis: may the great Sire hear my words, who sanctions treaties with his thunderbolt! I touch the altars, I adjure these fires and gods that stand between us: no time shall break this peace and truce for Italy, however things befall; nor shall any force turn aside my will, not though, commingling all in deluge, it plunge land into water, and dissolve Heaven into Hell: just as this sceptre”

	turmoil; all the more now, when they beheld the combatants at closer view [c dimgray]in ill-matched strength.[/c] Turnus swells the unrest by advancing with noiseless tread and as a suppliant venerating the altar with downcast eye—swells it by his wasted cheeks and by the pallor of his youthful frame. As soon as Juturna his sister saw these whispers spread, and the hearts of the throng wavering in doubt, into the midmost ranks, in feigned semblance of Camers—noble his ancestral house, glorious the renown of his father’s worth, and he himself most valiant in arms—into the midmost ranks she comes, knowing well her task, scatters diverse rumours, and speaks these words: “Are you not ashamed, Rutulians, to set one man’s life at hazard for so many men? Are we not their match in numbers and in might? See, all of them are here, both Trojans and Arcadians, and the fate-led troops of Etruria, hostile to Turnus: even if only every other man of us joins battle, there is scarcely an enemy for each of us. Turnus will mount on fame to the gods, on whose altars he has dedicated his life, and shall endure on the lips of men:
	[c dimgray][sup]13[/sup][/c] but we, our country lost, will submit perforce to haughty masters—we, who today sit listless in the fields!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	With such words the warriors’ resolve is kindled yet more and more, and a murmur creeps from rank to rank. Even the Laurentines, even the Latins are changed; and they who but lately hoped for rest from the fray, and safety for their fortunes, now long for arms, pray that the covenant be undone, and pity Turnus’ unjust fate. To these Juturna adds another and mightier impulse, and in high

	heaven shows a sign, than which none was more potent to confound Italian minds and cheat them with its miracle. Flying through the ruddy sky, Jove’s golden bird was chasing the fowls of the shore and the clamorous rout of their winged troop, when, swooping suddenly to the water, he shamelessly snatches up in his crooked talons the leader swan. The Italians become alert and, wondrous to behold, all the birds clamorously wheel their flight and, darkening the sky with wings, in serried cloud drive their foe through the air till, overborne by the onset and the sheer weight, the bird gave way, dropped the booty from his talons into the stream, and sped deep into the clouds.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	Then in truth the Rutulians hail the omen with a cheer and spread out their hands.
	[c dimgray][sup]14[/sup][/c] And first of all Tolumnius the augur cries: “This it was, this, that my prayers have often sought! I accept it, I acknowledge the gods. With me, me, at your head, snatch up the sword, hapless people, whom, like frail birds, a shameless alien affrights with war, and violently ravages your coasts. He too will take to flight, and spread sail far across the deep. With one accord close up your ranks, and in battle defend the king who has been snatched from you!”
	[m1]\ [/m]
	He spoke, and, darting forward, hurled his spear full against the foe; the whistling cornel shaft sings, and splits the air, unerring. At this deed, at once rises a mighty shout, the crowds are all confusion, and their hearts hot with turmoil. The spear flew on where, as it chanced, nine brothers of fine stature stood in its path—all of them his one faithful Tuscan wife had borne to Arcadian Gylippus. One of these

But his brothers—a gallant band, and fired by grief—some draw their swords, some seize their spears, and rush blindly on. Against them charge the Laurentine columns; from the other side again Trojans and Agyllines pour thickly in and Arcadians with blazoned arms. Thus all are ruled by one passion—to let the sword decide. They have stripped the altars; through the whole sky flies a thickening storm of javelins and the iron rain falls fast; bowls and hearth fires are carried off. Latinus himself takes flight, carrying away his defeated gods, the covenant now void; the others rein their chariots or leap on to their horses and with drawn swords stand ready.

Then himself pursuing the stroke, he clutches in his left hand the locks of his bewildered foe, and with a thrust of his bended knee brings his body to the earth, and there strikes his side with unyielding sword. Podalirius, pursuing with naked steel, towers over the shepherd Alsus as in foremost line he rushes through the darts; but Alsus, swinging back his axe, cuts through the middle of his enemy’s brow and chin, and drenches his armour with widely spattered gore. Stern repose and iron slumber press upon his eyes, and their sight is curtained in everlasting night.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	But good Aeneas, with head bared, was stretching forth his unarmed hand, and calling loudly to his men: “Where are you going? What is this sudden outburst of strife? Curb your rage! The truce has already been struck and all its terms fixed; I alone have the right to do battle. Let me act; banish your fears; this hand will prove the treaty true; these rites make Turnus already mine!” Amid these cries, amid such words, against him a whizzing arrow winged its way, launched by what hand, sped whirling by whom, none knows, nor who—chance or god—brought the Rutulians such honour: the fame of that high deed is hidden, and no one boasted of the wounding of Aeneas.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	As soon as Turnus saw Aeneas withdrawing from the ranks, and his captains in confusion, he burns with the fire of sudden hope, calls for horses and arms, with a bound leaps proudly into his chariot, and firmly grasps the reins. In his swift course many a brave man’s body he gives to death; many men he tumbles half-slain, or crushes whole ranks under his chariot, or, seizing spear after spear, show­ers

Just as when by the streams of icy Hebrus blood-stained Mavors, stirred to fury, thunders with his shield and, rousing war, gives rein to his frenzied steeds; over the open plain they outstrip the South Wind and the West; furthest Thrace moans with the beat of their hoofs, and around him speed the forms of black Terror and Anger and Ambush, attendants on the god: with the same eagerness Turnus goads his sweat-smoking horses amid the fray, trampling on the foes, piteously slain; the galloping hoof splashes bloody dews, and spurns the gore and mingled sand. And now he has given Sthenelus to death, and Thamyrus, and Pholus, these in close encounter, the first from a distance; from a distance the sons of Imbrasus, Glaucus and Lades, whom Imbrasus himself had nurtured in Lycia and equipped with matched arms, either to fight hand to hand or on horseback to outstrip the winds.

This is the reward of those who dare to tempt me with the sword; so do they establish their walls!” Then with cast of spear he sends Asbytes to keep him company, and Chloreus and Sybaris, Dares and Thersilochus, and Thymoetes, flung from the neck of his restive horse. And as when the blast of the Edonian North Wind roars on the deep Aegean and drives the billows shoreward; where the winds swoop, the clouds scud through the sky: so, wherever Turnus cleaves a path, the ranks give way and lines turn and run; his own speed bears him on, and the breeze, as his chariot meets it, tosses his flying plume. Phegeus could not meet his attack and fiery rage; he flung himself in front of the chariot and with his right hand wrenched aside the jaws of the furious horses, foaming on the bits. While he is dragged along clinging to the yoke, the broad spearhead reaches his unguarded side, rends the two-plated corslet where it has lodged, and with its wound just grazes the surface of the flesh. Yet he, with his shield before him, turned and was making for his foe, seeking aid from his drawn sword, when the wheel and axle, whirling onward, struck him headlong and flung him to the ground, and Turnus, following, with sweepof blade between the helmet’s lowest rim and the breastplate’s upper edge, struck off his head, and left the body on the sand.

He, to defer the fate of a father sick unto death, chose rather to know the virtues of herbs and the practice of healing, and to ply, inglorious, the silent arts.
	[c dimgray][sup]19[/sup][/c] Bitterly chafing, Aeneas stood propped on his mighty spear, amid a great concourse of warriors along with sorrowing Iülus, himself unmoved by their tears. The aged healer, with robe rolled back, and girt in Paeonian fashion, with healing hand and Phoebus’ potent herbs works hard—in vain; in vain with his hand he pulls at the arrow, and with gripping tongs tugs at the steel. No Fortune guides his path, no help does Apollo’s counsel give; and more and more the fierce alarm swells over the plains, and disaster draws closer. Now they see the sky supported on columns of dust; on come the horsemen, and shafts fall thick in the middle of the camp. The dismal cry rises to heaven, of men that fight and men that fall beneath the stern War God’s hand.

This Venus carried down, her face veiled in dim mist; this she steeps with secret healing in river water poured into a bright-brimming ewer, and sprinkles ambrosia’s healing juices and fragrant panacea.
	[c dimgray][sup]21[/sup][/c] With this water aged Iapyx bathed the wound, unwitting; and suddenly, in truth, all pain fled from the body, all blood was staunched deep in the wound. And now, following his hand, with no force applied, the arrow fell out, and new strength returned, as it was before. “Quick! Bring him arms! Why stand there?” cries Iapyx loudly, and is the first to fire their spirit against the foe. “Not by mortal aid does this cure come, not by the art that guides me, nor is it my hand that saves you, Aeneas; a mightier one—a god—is at work, and sends you back to mightier deeds.” Eager for the fray, Aeneas had sheathed his legs in gold on this side and that and, scorning delay, is brandishing his spear. As soon as the shield is fitted to his side and the corslet to his back, he clasps Ascanius in armed embrace and, lightly kissing his lips through the helmet, says: “Learn valour from me, my son, and true toil; fortune from others. Today my hand will shield you in war and lead you to great rewards: see to it, when later your years have grown to ripeness, that you remember, and, as you recall the example set by your kinsmen, that your father Aeneas and your uncle Hector stir your soul!”

	spear in his hand: with him rush Antheus and Mnestheus in serried column, and all the throng streams out of the forsaken camp. Then the plain is a turmoil of blinding dust, and the startled earth trembles under the tramp of feet. From the facing rampart Turnus saw them coming; the Ausonians saw, and a cold shudder ran through the marrow of their bones; first before all the Latins Juturna heard and knew the sound, and in terror fled away. Aeneas swoops ahead and races his dark column over the open plain. As when a tempest bursts, and a storm cloud moves towards land over the deepsea, the hearts of hapless husbandmen, alas! know it from afar and shudder—it will bring downfall to trees and havoc to crops, it will overthrow everything far and wide—before it the winds fly, and carry their voices shoreward: just so the Rhoetean
	[c dimgray][sup]22[/sup][/c] chief brings up his band full against the foe; densely they gather, one and all, to his side in close-packed columns. Thymbraeus smites mighty Osiris with the sword, Mnestheus slays Arcetius, Achates Epulo, Gyas Ufens; even the augur Tolumnius falls, who had been the first to hurl his spear full against the foe. A shout rises to heaven, and in turn the routed Rutulians turn their backs in clouds of dust, in flight across the fields. Aeneas himself does not deign to lay low the fugitives in death nor does he attack those who meet him on foot or on horse or wield their weapons: Turnus alone he tracks through the thick gloom with searching glance, Turnus alone he summons to battle.

	she herself takes his place, and guides with her hands the flowing thongs, assuming all that belonged to Meniscus—his voice, form, weapons. As when a black swallow flits through a rich lord’s great mansion and wings her way through lofty halls, gleaning for her chirping nestlings tiny crumbs and scraps of food, and twitters now in the empty courts, now about the watery pools: just so Juturna is borne by the steeds through the midst of the enemy, and winging her way in swift chariot scours all the field. And nowhere, and now there, she gives glimpses of her triumphant brother, but does not allow him to close in fight, but flits far away. None the less Aeneas threads the winding maze to meet him, and tracks his steps, and among the scattered ranks loudly calls him. As often as he cast eyes on his foe and strove by running to match the flight of the fleet-footed horses, so often did Juturna turn and wheel her car. Alas, what is he to do? Vainly he tosses on a shifting tide, and conflicting cares call his mind this way and that. Against him Messapus, who chanced to be carrying in his left hand two tough spears tipped with steel, lightly advancing, levels one and whirls it with unerring stroke. Aeneas halted, and gathered himself behind his shield, sinking upon his knee; but the swift spear took off the top of his helmet and dashed the topmost plumes from his head. Then indeed his wrath swells and driven on by this treachery, when he saw that the horses and chariot of his foe were far away, making many appeals to Jove and the altars of the broken treaty, at last he plunges into the fray and, with the War God supporting him, terribly awakes grim indiscriminate carnage, giving full rein to his anger.

	in song can tell such diverse deaths, and the fall of captains, whom now Turnus, now the Trojan hero, drives in turn all over the plain? Was it your will, Jupiter, that in so vast a shock nations should clash that thereafter would dwell in everlasting peace? Aeneas, meeting Rutulian Sucro—this was the combat that first brought the Trojan attack to a halt—quickly smites him on the flank and drives the cruel steel where death comes speediest, through the ribs that fence the chest. Turnus unhorses Amycus and his brother Diores and, assailing them on foot, strikes the one with a long spear as he advances, the other with his sword; then, hanging from his car the severed heads of the two, he bears them off dripping with blood. Aeneas sends to death Talos and Tanaïs and brave Cethegus, three in one onslaught, and sad Onites, of Echionian name,
	[c dimgray][sup]23[/sup][/c] whose mother was Peridia; Turnus kills the brothers sent from Lycia and Apollo’s fields,

And like fires launched from opposite sides into a dry forest and thickets of crackling laurel, or as when in swift descent from mountain heights foaming rivers roar and race seaward, each leaving its own path waste: with no less fury the two, Aeneas and Turnus, sweep through the battle; now, now wrath surges within them; their unconquerable hearts are bursting, knowing not to yield; now

	As Murranus boasts of his grandfathers and the ancient names of his ancestors and all his family traced through Latin kings, Aeneas dashes him down headlong with a stone and mighty whirling rock and tumbles him on the ground; under reins and yoke the wheels rolled him along, and over him, trampling him down with many a beat, rush the hoofs of the horses who remember not their master. Turnus meets Hyllus as he rushes on with boundless fury at heart, and whirls a dart at his gold-bound brow: piercing the helmet, the spear stood fast in his brain. And your right hand, Cretheus, bravest of the Greeks, did not save you from Turnus, nor did his gods shield Cupencus when Aeneas came:
	[c dimgray][sup]25[/sup][/c] he put his breast in the weapon’s path, and the bronze shield’s delay availed him not, poor wretch. You too, Aeolus, the Laurentine plains saw fall, and spread your frame widely over the earth: you fall whom the Argive battalions could not lay low, nor Achilles, destroyer of Priam’s realms. Here was the end of your life’s course; beneath Ida was your lofty home—your lofty home at Lyrnesus—in Laurentine soil your sepulchre. The whole lines turned to the fray—all the Latins and all the Trojans: Mnestheus and valiant Serestus; Messapus, tamer of horses, and brave Asilas; the Tuscan battalion and Evander’s Arcadian squadrons—each doing his all, the men strain with utmost force of strength; there is no rest nor respite as they struggle in measureless conflict.

	Latins with sudden disaster. While he tracked Turnus here and there through the troops and swept his glance this way and that, he sees the city free from that fierce warfare, peaceful and unharmed. At once a vision of greater battle fires his heart; he calls Mnestheus and Sergestus and brave Serestus, and plants himself on a mound, where the rest of the Teucrian host throng thickly around without laying down shield or spear. Standing among them on the mounded height he cries: “Let nothing delay my command; Jupiter is on our side; and let no one, I pray, be slower to advance because the venture is so sudden. That city, the cause of war, the very seat of Latinus’ realm, unless they consent to receive our yoke and to submit as vanquished, this very day I will overthrow, and lay its smoking roofs level with the ground. Am I to wait, do you suppose, till Turnus sees fit to do battle with me, and chooses to meet me a second time, beaten though he is? This, fellow citizens, is the head, this the sum, of the accursed war. Bring brands with speed, and with fire reclaim the treaty.” He ceased, and with hearts equally emulous all form a wedge and advance in serried mass to the walls. In a moment ladders and sudden flames are seen. Some rush to the several gates and cut down the foremost guards; others hurl their steel and darken the sky with javelins. Himself in the van at the foot of the wall, Aeneas raises his hand, loudly reproaches Latinus, and calls the gods to witness that he is being forced into battle again, that the Italians have now twice become his foes, and that this treaty is the second broken. Strife rises among the anxious citizens: some bid unbar the town and throw wide the gates to the Dardans, and drag the king himself to the ramparts; others

As when some shepherd has tracked bees to their lair in a rocky covert and filled it with stinging smoke; inside, anxious for their safety, they scurry to and fro through the wax fortress, and with loud buzzing whet their rage; the black stench rolls through their dwelling, the rocks within murmur with blind hum, and smoke billows out into the empty air.

	This further fate befell the weary Latins, and shook the whole city to its base with grief: when from her palace the queen sees the foe approaching, the walls assailed, flames mounting to the roofs, but nowhere Rutulian ranks or any troops of Turnus to meet them, the unhappy woman thinks that Turnus has been slain in combat and, her mind distraught by sudden anguish, cries out that she is the guilty source and spring of sorrows, and uttering many a wild word in the frenzy of grief, resolved to die she rends her purple robes, and from a lofty beam fastens the noose of a hideous death. As soon as the unhappy Latin women learned this disaster, first her daughter Lavinia, her hand tearing her golden tresses and rosy cheeks, falls into a frenzy, then all the throng around her; the wide halls ring with lamentations. From here the woeful rumour spreads throughout the town. Hearts sink; Latinus goes with rent raiment, dazed at his wife’s doom and his city’s downfall, defiling his hoary hair with showers of unclean dust, [c dimgray]oft chiding himself that he did not give a ready welcome to Dardan Aeneas and adopt him as his son.[/c]

To him the breeze bore a cry blended with terrors unknown, and the sound and joyless murmur of the town in turmoil fell on his straining ears. “Ah me! What is this great sorrow that shakes the walls? What is this cry that speeds from the distant town?” So he speaks, and in frenzy draws in the reins and halts. At this his sister, changed to the form of his charioteer Metiscus, as she guided chariot and horses and reins, meets him with these words: “This way, Turnus, let us chase the sons of Troy, where victory first opens a path; there are others whose hands can guard their homes. Aeneas is attacking the Italians with turmoil of battle; let our hand too deal fierce havoc among his Teucrians! Neither in number of slain nor in glory in battle will you come off the worse.” To this Turnus ...: “Sister, long ago I recognized you, when first you craftily upset the truce and flung yourself into this war; and now too you hide your deity in vain. But who willed that you be sent down from Olympus to bear such toils? Was it so that you would see your hapless brother’s cruel death? For what can I do? What chance can now assure me of safety? Before my very eyes, as he called loudly upon me, I saw Murranus fall—no other dearer than he is left to me—a mighty soul and laid low by a mighty wound. Luckless Ufens fell so that he would not view our shame: the Teucrians hold his corpse and armour.

	Scarce had he spoken, when borne on a foaming steed through the foemen’s midst speeds Saces, wounded full in face by an arrow and, rushing on, calls for aid by name on Turnus: “Turnus, in you lies our last hope; pity your people! Aeneas thunders in arms, and threatens to overthrow Italy’s highest towers and give them to destruction: even now brands are flying to the roofs. To you the Latins turn their looks, to you their eyes; King Latinus himself mutters, in doubt whom to call his sons, or towards what alliance to incline. Moreover the queen, who trusted wholly in you, has fallen by her own hand and fled in terror from the light. Alone before the gates Messapus and valiant Atinas sustain our lines. Around them on either side stand serried squadrons, and a harvest of steel bristles with drawn swords, while you wheel your chariot over the deserted sward.” Aghast and bewildered by the changing picture of disaster, Turnus stood mutely gazing; within that single heart surges mighty shame, and madness mingled with grief, and love stung by fury, and the consciousness of worth. As soon as the shadows scattered and light dawned afresh on his mind, he turned his blazing eyes wrathfully upon the walls and from his chariot looked back upon the spacious city.

And as when a rock from mountaintoprushes headlong, torn away by the blast—whether the whirling storm has washed it free, or time stealing on with lapse of years has loosened it, down the steep with mighty rush sweeps the reckless mass and bounds over the earth, rolling with it trees, herds, and men: so among the scattered ranks Turnus rushes to the city walls, where the ground is deepest drenched with spilled blood and the air is shrill with spears; then he beckons with his hand and thus begins aloud: “Forbear now, Rutulians, and you Latins, stay your darts. Whatever fortune is here is mine; it is better that I alone for your sake atone for the covenant, and decide the outcome with the sword.” All those between them dispersed and gave him room.

	Apennine himself, when he roars with his shimmering oaks, and joyously raises his snowy head to heaven. Now indeed, all eagerly turned their eyes—Rutulians, and Trojans, and Italians, both those who held the lofty ramparts, and those whose ram battered the walls below—and took off the armour from their shoulders. Latinus himself is amazed that these mighty men, born in different parts of the world, have met together and are deciding the outcome with the sword. And as soon as the fields were clear on the open plain, the two dash swiftly forward, first hurling their spears from far, and rush into battle with shields and clanging bronze. Earth groans; then with the sword they redouble blow on blow, chance and valour blending in one. And as in mighty Sila or on Taburnus’ height, when two bulls charge, brow to brow, in mortal battle, in terror the keepers fall back, the whole herd stands mute with dread, and the heifers dumbly wait to see who will be lord of the forest, whom all the herds will follow; with mighty force they deal mutual wounds, gore with butting horns, and bathe neck and shoulders in streaming blood; all the woodland re-echoes with their bellowing: just so Trojan Aeneas and the Daunian hero clash shield on shield; the mighty crash fills the sky. Jupiter himself holds up two scales in even balance, and lays in them the diverse destinies of both—whom the strife dooms, and with whose weight death sinks down.

	excitement. But the treacherous sword snaps, and in mid stroke fails its ardent lord, did not flight come to his aid. Swifter than the East Wind he flies, as soon as he sees an unknown hilt in his defenceless hand. They say that in his headlong haste, when first mounting behind his yoked horses for battle, he left his father’s blade behind and in his haste snatched up the sword of Metiscus his charioteer; and for long that served, while the straggling Teucrians turned their backs; but when it met the god-wrought armour of Vulcan, the mortal blade, like brittle ice, flew asunder at the stroke; the fragments glitter on the yellow sand. So Turnus madly flees this way and that over the plain, and now in one direction and now in another he entwines wavering circles; for on all sides the Teucrians enclosed him in a crowded ring, and on one side a waste fen, on another steep ramparts hem him in.
	[m1]\ [/m]
	No less Aeneas, though at times his knees, slowed by the arrow wound, impede him and deny their speed, pursues and hotly presses, foot to foot, upon his panting foe; as when a hunter hound has caught a stag, pent in by a stream or hedged about by the terror of crimson feathers, and, running and barking, presses him close; the stag, in terror of the snares and the high bank, flees to and fro in a thousand ways, but the keen Umbrian stays close with jaws agape; he almost seizes him, and snaps his jaws as if he had seized him, and baffled, bites on empty air. Then indeed a din breaks out; the banks and pools around make answer, and all heaven thunders with the tumult. Even as he flees, even then Turnus upbraids all the Rutulians, calling each by name, and clamouring for the sword he knows. Aeneas

	By chance a bitter-leaved wild olive, sacred to Faunus, had stood here, a tree revered of old by mariners, on which, when saved from the waves, they were wont to fasten their gifts to the god of Laurentum and hang up their votive garments; but the Teucrians, making no exception, had removed the sacred stem, so that they could fight on open ground. Here stood the spear of Aeneas; its force had carried it here and was holding it fast in the tough root. The Dardan stooped, meaning to pluck away the steel perforce and follow with his javelin the man he could not catch by speed of foot. Then indeed Turnus, frantic with terror, cried: “Faunus, have pity, I pray, and you, most gracious Earth, hold fast the steel, if ever I have honoured your rites, which the sons of Aeneas, to the contrary, have defiled by war.” He spoke, and not in vain did he invoke the aid of heaven. For though long he wrestled and lingered over the stubborn stem, by no strength could Aeneas unlock the oaken bite. While fiercely he tugs and strains, the Daunian goddess,
	[c dimgray][sup]28[/sup][/c] changing once again into the form of charioteer Metiscus, runs forward and restores the sword to her brother. But Venus, enraged that such license was granted the bold nymph, drew near and plucked the weapon from the deep root.

	Meanwhile the king of almighty Olympus addresses Juno, as from a golden cloud she gazes on the fray: “What now shall be the end, wife? What remains at the last? You yourself know, and admit that you know, that Aeneas, as Hero of the land, is claimed by heaven, and that the Fates exalt him to the stars. What are you planning? In what hope are you lingering in the chill clouds? Was it well that a god should be profaned by a mortal’s wound? Or that the lost sword—for without you what could Juturna do?—be restored to Turnus, and the vanquished gain fresh force? Cease now, I pray, and yield to my entreaties so that your great grief may not consume you in silence, nor your bitter cares often return to me from your sweet lips. The end is reached. To chase the Trojans over land or wave, to kindle monstrous war, to mar a happy home and blend bridals with woe—this power you have had; I forbid you to try any further!” So Jupiter spoke: so, with downcast look, the goddess, child of Saturn, replied:
	[m1]\ [/m]
	“It was indeed because I knew, great Jove, that this was your pleasure, that I reluctantly left Turnus and the earth; otherwise you would not see me now, alone on my airy throne, enduring fair and foul, but girt in flame I would be standing right in the battle line and dragging the Teucrians into deadly combat. As for Juturna, I counselled her, I own, to help her hapless brother, and for his life’s sake sanctioned still greater deeds of daring, but not to level the arrow, not to bend the bow: I swear by the inexorable fountainhead of Styx, sole name of dread ordained for the gods above.

	[c dimgray][sup]29[/sup][/c] when anon with happy bridal rites—so be it!—they plight peace, when anon they join in laws and treaties, do not command the native Latins to change their ancient name, nor to become Trojans and be called Teucrians, nor to change their language and alter their attire: let Latium be, let Alban kings endure through ages, let be a Roman stock, strong in Italian valour: Troy is fallen, and fallen let her be, together with her name!”

	Smiling on her, the creator of men and things replied: “You are Jove’s true sister, and Saturn’s other child: such waves of wrath surge deep within your breast! But come, allay the anger that was stirred in vain. I grant your wish and relent, willingly won over. Ausonia’s sons shall keep their fathers’ speech and ways, and as it is now, so shall their name be: the Teucrians shall but sink down, merged in the mass. I will give them their sacred laws and rites and make them all Latins of one tongue. From them shall arise a race, blended with Ausonian blood, which you will see overpass men, overpass gods in loyalty, and no nation will celebrate your worshipwith equal zeal.” Juno assented to this and joyfully changed her purpose; then she leaves heaven, and quits the cloud.

	This done, the Father revolves another purpose in his heart, and prepares to withdraw Juturna from her brother’s side. Men tell of twin fiends, named the Dread Ones, whom untimely Night bore in one and the same birth with hellish Megaera, wreathing them alike with snaky coils and

These attend by the throne of Jove and on the threshold of that grim monarch, and whet the fears of feeble mortals, whenever heaven’s king wreaks diseases and awful death, or terrifies guilty towns with war. Jove sent one of them swiftly down from high heaven, and bade her meet Juturna as a sign. She wings her way, and darts to earth in swift whirlwind. Like an arrow, shot from the bow string through a cloud, an arrow armed with the gall of fell poison, which a Parthian—a Parthian or a Cydonian—has launched, a shaft beyond all cure; whizzing, it leaps unseen through the swift shadows: so sped the child of Night and sought the earth. As soon as she sees the Ilian ranks and Turnus’ troops, suddenly shrinking to the shape of that small bird which often, perched at night on tombs or deserted roofs, sings her late, ill-omened song among the shadows, so changed in form the fiend flits screaming to and fro before the face of Turnus, and beats his shield with her wings. A strange numbness slackened his limbs with dread; his hair stood up in terror and the voice cleaved to his throat.

	But when his unhappy sister Juturna recognized the Dread One’s whirring wings from afar, she tears her loosened hair, disfiguring her face with her nails, and her breasts with her fists: “What help, Turnus, can your sister give you now? What still awaits me, who have endured so much? With what contrivance can I prolong your life? Can I stand against this terrible portent? Now at last I quit the field. Do not terrify my fluttering soul, ill-boding birds! I know your beating wings, and their dreadful sound, and I do not mistake the haughty mandates of high-hearted

Then I could end this anguish, and pass through the shadows at my poor brother’s side! I immortal! Will anything of mine be sweet to me without you, my brother? What ground can gape deep enough for me, and send me down, goddess as I am, to the deepest shades?” So saying, she veiled her head in a mantle of grey, and with many a moan the goddess plunged into the depths of the river.

	Aeneas presses on against the foe, brandishing his great tree-like spear, and thus he cries in wrathful spirit: “What more delay is there now? Why, Turnus, do you still draw back? Not in a race, but hand to hand with savage weapons, must we contend. Change yourself into all shapes, muster all your powers of courage or skill; wing your flight, if you will, to the stars aloft, or hide within earth’s hollow prison!” The other, shaking his head: “Your fiery words, proud one, do not daunt me; it is the gods who daunt me, and the enmity of Jove.” Saying no more, he glances round and sees a huge stone, an ancient stone and huge which by chance lay upon the plain, set for a landmark to keep dispute from the fields. Twice six chosen men could scarce lift it on their shoulders, men of such frames as earth now produces: but the hero, with hurried grasp, seized and hurled it at his foe, rising to his height and at swiftest speed. But he does not recognize himself as he runs, nor as he moves, as he raises the mighty stone in his hand or throws it; his knees buckle, his blood is frozen cold.

	nor drive home its blow. And as in dreams, when languorous sleep has weighed down our eyes at night, we seem to strive in vain to press on our eager course, and in mid effort collapse helpless: our tongue lacks power, our wonted strength fails our limbs, and neither voice nor words will come: so to Turnus, however bravely he sought to win his way, the dread goddess denies fulfilment. Then shifting fancies whirl through his mind; he gazes on his Rutulians and the town, he falters in fear, and trembles at the death that looms; he sees nowhere to escape, nowhere to attack his foe; he cannot see his chariot anywhere, or his sister, the charioteer.

	As he wavers, Aeneas brandishes the fateful spear, seeing a favorable chance, then hurls it from afar with all his strength. Never do stones shot from a siege engine roar so loud, never do such great crashes burst from a thunderbolt. Like a black whirlwind the spear flies on, bearing fell destruction, and pierces the corslet’s rim and the sevenfold shield’s outermost circle: whizzing it passes right through the thigh. Under the blow, with his knee bent down to earth beneath him, huge Turnus sank. The Rutulians start up with a groan; all the hills re-echo round about, and far and near the wooded slopes send back the sound. In supplication he lowered his eyes and stretched out his right hand: “I have earned it,” he cried, “and I ask no mercy; use your chance. If any thought of a parent’s grief can touch you, I beg you—you too had such a father in Anchises—pity Daunus’ old age, and give me—or, if you prefer, my lifeless body—back to my kin. You are the victor; and the

	Ausonians have seen me stretch forth my hands as the vanquished: Lavinia is your wife; do not press your hatred further.” Fierce in his armour, Aeneas stood still shifting his eyes, and restrained his hand; and now, as he paused, these words began to sway him more and more, when high on the shoulder the luckless baldric met his gaze, and the belt flashed with its well-known studs—the belt of young Pallas, whom Turnus had wounded and stretched vanquished on the earth, and now he wore on his shoulders his foeman’s fatal emblem. Aeneas, as soon as his eyes drank in the trophy, that memorial of cruel grief, ablaze with fury and terrible in his wrath: “Clad in the spoils of one of mine, are you to be snatched from my hands? Pallas it is, Pallas who sacrifices you with this stroke, and takes retribution from your guilty blood!” So saying, in burning rage he buries his sword full in Turnus’ breast. His limbs grew slack and chill and with a moan his life fled resentfully to the Shades below.
